1hclpsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hclpsi/mentors_the_secret_weapon_for_success/,Mentors: The Secret Weapon for Success,"Finding a mentor is a bit like stumbling upon a hidden treasure chest that’s overflowing with wisdom, experience, and a lot of laughter. I mean, who wouldn’t want someone in their corner with battle scars and life lessons to share? If you’ve ever tried to navigate life’s winding paths alone, you’ll realize pretty quickly that having someone who’s been there before can make a massive difference. 

So, how do you approach a mentor? First thing’s first: be genuine. There’s no magic formula, but if you’re stumbling around with awkward phrases that make you sound like a human robot, it’s going to be a tough sell. Instead, show them who you are—quirks, questions, and all. Whether it’s through a heartfelt email, a casual coffee chat, or even the classic “help me, I’m lost” conversation, just be real. Make it clear why you value their perspective, and don’t be afraid to share your own aspirations and struggles. Vulnerability can be incredibly disarming, like opening the door to a cozy, warm room where great conversations can unfold.

Now, as for the lessons I’ve learned from my own magnificent mentor—let’s just say I’ve got a treasure trove of nuggets tucked away in my back pocket. One of the biggest takeaways? Life is messy, and it's okay to embrace that chaos! My mentor once told me that even on days when you feel like a hot mess, God is still crafting a masterpiece. Those words hit me right in the feels, reminding me that every slip-up and detour is part of our unique narrative. 

Another golden nugget? The power of community. My mentor has a knack for bringing people together. She taught me that we’re not meant to journey alone. Whether it’s sharing a meal or leaning on each other during tough times, there’s something incredible about being part of a community that lifts each other up. It’s like a spiritual booster shot, reminding us of God’s love reflected through others.

So, if you’re still on the fence about finding a mentor, do yourself a favor and take the leap. Seek out someone whose life you admire, someone who isn’t afraid to speak the hard truths, and watch how your perspective shifts. The beauty of mentorship is that it’s a two-way street—you’re not just a sponge soaking up wisdom; you’re also contributing your unique voice and experiences to the mix. Trust me, it’s a journey worth taking!",1,1734012080.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False
1hclppz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OOALMarketing/comments/1hclppz/sponsored_discover_michael_jacksons_incredible/,Sponsored *Discover Michael Jackson’s Incredible Secrets to Business! Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1734012075.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

I will DM photos of my dad to someone who thinks they can do this for an agreeable price, I am just not super comfortable putting his picture up publicly. Please reach out! Thanks

1hclfin,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hclfin,"A couple questions. Milling, wood ID, and stickering.","I'm new to woodworking and a stay-at-home dad with three kids (1, 5, & 8). Woodworking has been a calming hobby for me. Getting the shop set up ""right"" has been going on for 1.5 years. It's not done. I don't get as much shop time as I'd like thanks to the one year old. I have only built a few things. Mostly simple stuff around the house like shelving in the kid's closet and boards with hooks for coat hangers. I did make a floating mantle, out of poplar, above the fireplace that I'm quite proud of (it's hollow but I mitered? all the edges to not show any of the edge). But I'd like to step my game up. 

I want to build a coffee table for our den and a large kneading board for my wife. An older gentleman, that has rented some storage space in my dad's barn for a long time, heard I was interested in wood working. He had a pile of rough cut hardwood that had been sitting in storage for years and gave all of it to me. I moved some of it to my shop (I live 4 hours away) and laid it out flat with wood stickers between each board.  It's been there for over a year. Problem is it's a mix of wood and I have no idea what I'm looking at unless is really obvious (like walnut or cedar). I have a used 6"" Delta jointer and a DeWalt planer. I've started milling some of the wood to see what I have and what will work for my projects. Just a few light passes through the planer on a planer sled to help see what kind of wood it is. So questions....

1. Wood ID - Hopefully you all can help me ID the boards above. The more descriptive you can be as to how you determine the species would be great and really help me start to learn. 
2. Stickering - I believe the faint lines perpendicular to the grain are from the sticks I used. Do I need to continue to run them through the planer  until those marks are gone? What do you all use for stickering? I have a lot of short pieces of  ½"" PVC pipe. Would that be a good alternative, assuming I keep the boards from rolling? 
3. Is asking for a wood ID okay to do here? In the future I know I'll have more. 
4. Milling - Any milling advice? Some of the wood have large knots or major twists or bends. I plan on cutting any like that shorter before milling. There are a variety of widths 5"" - 20"". So I can't face joint most of it and some of the really wide boards will need a different approach but that's for another day.

Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",1,1734011204.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,1.0,False
1hcle1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitnessOver50/comments/1hcle1h/the_truth_about_holiday_spirits/,The Truth About Holiday Spirits,"Many of us look forward to celebrations during the holidays, yet it is also a time when some people are more likely to drink beyond their limits than at other times of the year. Some people will experience adverse consequences that range from fights to falls to traffic crashes. 

# Myths Persist

Despite the potential dangers, myths about drinking persist, which—for some—can prove fatal. Scientific studies supported by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism provide important information that challenges these widespread, yet incorrect, beliefs about how quickly alcohol affects the body and how long the effects of drinking last.

# Alcohol’s Effects Begin Quickly, Before You Know It!

People may not recognize that critical decision-making abilities and driving-related skills are already diminished long before they show overt signs of intoxication.

Initially, alcohol may appear to act as a stimulant, so people who drink may feel upbeat and excited. But don’t be fooled. Alcohol decreases inhibitions and judgment and can lead to reckless decisions.

As people consume more alcohol, reaction times get longer and behavior becomes poorly controlled and sometimes even aggressive—leading to fights and other types of violence. Continued drinking causes the slurred speech and loss of balance that is typically associated with being drunk.

Alcohol can also cause blackouts—which are gaps in a person’s memory while they were intoxicated. These gaps happen when a person drinks enough alcohol to temporarily block the transfer of memories from short-term to long-term storage—known as memory consolidation—in a brain area called the hippocampus. At higher blood alcohol concentration levels, alcohol acts as a clear depressant, which can cause people who drink to pass out if the dose is high enough. At even higher levels, people who drink face the danger of life-threatening alcohol overdose due to the suppression of vital life functions.

# Even When Drinking Stops—Alcohol’s Effects Do Not Stop

During an evening of drinking, it’s easy to misjudge how long alcohol’s effects last. For example, many people believe that they will begin to sober up—and be able to drive safely—once they stop drinking and have a cup of coffee. The truth is that alcohol continues to affect the brain and body long after the last drink has been finished. Even after someone stops drinking, alcohol in the stomach and intestine continues to enter the bloodstream, resulting in impaired judgment and coordination for hours.

# Before You Celebrate—Plan Ahead

Of course, we don’t intend to harm anyone when we celebrate during the holiday season. Yet, violence and traffic fatalities associated with alcohol misuse persist, and myths about drinking live on—even though scientific studies have documented how alcohol affects the brain and body.

Because individuals differ, the specific effects of alcohol on an individual will vary. But certain facts are clear—there’s no way to make good decisions when you are intoxicated, and there’s no way to sober up faster.

So, this holiday season, do not underestimate the effects of alcohol. Don’t believe you can beat them, or they may beat you. Think before you drink. 

Here are some tips to keep in mind if you host a holiday gathering:

* Offer a variety of alcohol-free drinks—water, juices, sparkling sodas. Alcohol-free drinks help counteract the dehydrating effects of alcohol. Also, the other fluids may slow the rate of alcohol absorption into the body and reduce the peak alcohol concentration in the blood. They also provide your guests with alternatives to alcohol.
* Provide a variety of healthy foods and snacks. Food can slow the absorption of alcohol and reduce the peak level of alcohol in the body by about one-third. Food can also minimize stomach irritation and gastrointestinal distress the following day.
* Help your guests get home safely—use designated drivers and taxis. Anyone getting behind the wheel of a car should not have ingested any alcohol.
* If you are a parent, understand the underage drinking laws—and set a good example.

Have a safe holiday season!

Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn’t. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn’t for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn’t be able to. 

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone. 

But being a Dad wasn’t a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn’t have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn’t trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn’t easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn’t really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear. 

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg’s brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn’t seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn’t funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many “red flags” but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had. 

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. “What’s the big deal?” Reg had asked his brother. “Just read a book, go on your phone.” But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43. 

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with. 

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg’s help it was published posthumously. You just didn’t know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up. 

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn’t deal with. 

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he’d rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like. 

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn’t the only one, or the podcast wouldn’t be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends. 

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go. 

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn’t the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden. 

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it. 

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn’t like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn’t look like what was happening to him. 

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn’t need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life. 

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn’t need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires. 

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn’t want to let go of the nail so he couldn’t skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn’t over. 

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn’t cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm. 

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going. 

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind’s attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve. 

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He’d give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn’t trust the nail. What if it wasn’t content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn’t they know people were suffering?! Still he didn’t turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn’t bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn’t like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he’d never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth? 

Reg’s curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

“You’ve got a big surprise coming to you” he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside. 

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he’d be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place. 

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. “Please God, let most of me be intact.”He pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail. 

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn’t care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn’t be right.

“I’m weak, I can’t do it, I’m weak, I can’t do it.” He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn’t actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn’t using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart. 

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn’t have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That’s right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn’t care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life’s blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn’t care if it killed him, as long as he died free. 

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone…

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone. 

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn’t want it to crawl back inside him. He didn’t think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn’t trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose. 

That’s when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

“You’re awake.”

“Yes.” He answered weakly.

“What happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?”

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg’s resting place.

“No, a hangnail.”

Norris laughed.

“Yeah, right.” Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

“What is it, some kind of root?” Norris asked.

“Some kind,” Reg answered.

“We need to get you inside where it’s warm.” Norris said, sounding concerned.

“No,” Reg said firmly. “First we get rid of it.”

“Okay, what would you like me to do with it?”

Reg wasn’t sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn’t matter as long as they did what was necessary.

“The compost bin,” Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

“Right,” Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

“No!” Reg shouted. “For God’s sake don’t touch it.” The thing could just be playing dead. 

“Go to the shed,” Reg instructed him, “there’s another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.”

The urgency of Reg’s tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him. 

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg’s beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

“Close the lid”, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony. 

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven’s Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

“Where do you keep your bandages, Reg?”

“Upstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.”

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris’s house was twice the size of Reg’s and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris’s handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He’d been out for 4 hours. 

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn’t like it, called the hosts as “cackling ghouls”. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

“Hello”, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff’s The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

“Sorry,” she said, and embraced him more gently.

“It’s okay.”

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

“How did you know I’d be awake?” He said, glancing at the tea.

“I didn’t, I just kept making them. That’s the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

“Ow.”

“Do you think you’re in a fit state to make those comments?”

“I am,” he said smiling.

“Why didn’t you call me?” She asked, becoming serious.

“I don’t know.” And he didn’t. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

“Silly man,” she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

“Ah you’re awake.” He said. “How are those bandages holding up?”

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

“I’ll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren’t that serious, it’s your chest I’d be worried about. You should really go to A and E.”

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death’s door you’d be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn’t fancy it.

“I’ll take my chances”, he said. “I have a good nurse.”

“Suit yourself.” Norris said, shrugging. “Make sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.”

“You patched up my wounded soldier,” Lucy said to Norris. “How will I ever repay you?”

“Don’t worry,” he said, “the tea and biscuits should cover it.”

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

“Thank you,” Reg said.

“Not at all.”

“So,” Lucy said, “Norris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?”

“That’s right,” Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

“It’s true,” Norris said. “I saw it myself. It was...” He struggled to convey it. “One for the books.” This gave him an idea. “In fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I’d just have to take some pictures...”

“No,” Reg said adamantly, “no one goes near it.”

Norris retreated. “You’re the boss,” he said. “Well, the wife has been sending me texts. She’s ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.”

“Understood,” Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro. 

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

“Reg, hun, was it really a hangnail?”

“Yes,” he said, feeling indignant.

“But how did it get so big?”

“Beats me.”

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. “You believe me don’t you, Luce?”

Whether she did or not she chose to. “Yes, hun,” she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. “Remember me?” They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy’s chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand. 

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn’t the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that. 

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces. 

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.",1,1734010860.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

1hclan2,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1hclan2/feeling_overwhelmed_by_the_missionaries_new_member/,Feeling overwhelmed by the missionaries (New member),"Hey all, I have been attending the church since earlier this year, married to a lifetime member, and became a member at the end of October. I have some questions that are bothering me about the missionaries.. I don't know if I'm just really not connecting well with him.. 

I was on maternity leave July-September, first time mom. We had the missionaries over weekly during that time, sometimes twice in a week. I was definitely trying to get through my lessons to get to baptism because I knew once back at work daily life would be a lot and I would lose a lot of time. After baptism the missionaries continued trying to meet with us 1-2 times a week, and I told them that things are really hectic right now trying to get back into the swing of things at work, getting used to preparing a three month old for daycare every day, getting home and having a laundry list of everything that needs to get done for that evening and the next day (all of which didn't exist while I was on maternity leave because I took care of everything during the day). They agreed to let me come up with a day that would work for us. Two days later they started texting me different dates and times. About this time everyone in the house got sick for about two weeks. Almost every day the missionaries would text me asking how we were which was very sweet, but after a few days it went back to ""We would love to come over tomorrow"" and so on and so on. I've tried explaining to them that right now we are just up to our eyeballs in the thick of the not so fun side of having a baby and we just need to get into a rhythm before we start planning meetings again. I've also been putting them off to maintain the last shred of sanity I have in me to get through a crazy day. I know what my family is going through is very temporary, it's just a season, but I need some peace and alone time during this and I just can't seem to convey that well enough to the missionaries. 

Since baptism I've met with them twice and my life was completely different after baptism than it was before baptism, so meeting them felt like going to class and having to study before a big test and our meeting was the test. Which started really really making me not enjoy our meetings, instead I would dread them because I didn't have enough time the days leading up to 'prepare'. And so then I don't want to meet up with them because I know the questions they're going to ask and I just don't have answers to them right now because I can barely even function through an entire work day (I've worked three total weeks in the two months I've been back because of a constantly sick baby, myself being sick, and my spouse being sick) and then passing out from exhaustion before 8 pm every day (and they are only able to meet after 7:30). But every couple of days I get this horrible feeling of pressure from them through text that it's time for another lesson, time to meet and discuss how God is uplifting my life. And truly right now God is and has been very silent since before the baptism, I don't have any doubts or questions, I still pray and ask for the same things from Him, but there is nothing that I can ""report back"" to the missionaries so that makes me feel like a complete failure on top of how absolutely insane my life has gotten since going back to work. I just want it all to stop, I want to feel like my relationship with God is slow and a peaceful stream alongside me like it always has rather than this new intense sprint that the missionaries make me feel it is. 

I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else has felt this way with the missionaries or does anyone have any advice for me (on how to handle the missionaries)?

Edited for an additional story: Also, I was a pretty heavy coffee drinker (decaf or sometimes 2/3 decaf, caffeine really hurts my stomach) to try and get through busy tiring days or the inevitable late night drives to keep me awake. The missionaries (as well as the bishop) know this and of course becoming a member told me I have to stop drinking it, I agreed. Well fast forward to now in the thick of life and I have been barely getting through these work days with the hour and a half to two hours of sleep I get a night with having a baby, and yesterday I almost ran off the road going to daycare. So I bought a 2/3 decaf coffee because I didn't want to accidentally kill anyone in a car accident as exhausted as I am, and so now I get shame from my spouse's family because they saw the coffee cup (we live with them) and I feel like I have to lie to the missionaries when they ask if I am living up to the words of wisdom. I feel like maybe God doesn't want me to accidentally kill my family or someone else in a car accident because I was so tired being a new mom and working full time, but then what do I know? All I know is I now the hate way my relationship feels with God since baptism... And it's all from the missionaries (and the coffee thing also from the bishop- I had actually had a conversation with the bishop before going back to work and how I'm not getting any sleep because of the baby and I don't know how I'm going to work full time and function without my small amounts of caffeine some days and he just told me ""we have to obey"").",2,1734010779.0,latterdaysaints,3,1.0,False

1hcla1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1hcla1g/in_for_a_penny/,In for a Penny,"In for a pound. That was Reg’s motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn’t. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn’t for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn’t be able to. 

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone. 

But being a Dad wasn’t a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn’t have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn’t trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn’t easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn’t really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear. 

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg’s brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn’t seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn’t funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many “red flags” but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had. 

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. “What’s the big deal?” Reg had asked his brother. “Just read a book, go on your phone.” But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43. 

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with. 

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg’s help it was published posthumously. You just didn’t know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up. 

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn’t deal with. 

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he’d rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like. 

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn’t the only one, or the podcast wouldn’t be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends. 

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go. 

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn’t the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden. 

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it. 

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn’t like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn’t look like what was happening to him. 

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn’t need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life. 

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn’t need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires. 

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn’t want to let go of the nail so he couldn’t skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn’t over. 

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn’t cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm. 

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going. 

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind’s attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve. 

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He’d give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn’t trust the nail. What if it wasn’t content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn’t they know people were suffering?! Still he didn’t turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn’t bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn’t like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he’d never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth? 

Reg’s curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

“You’ve got a big surprise coming to you” he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside. 

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he’d be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place. 

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. “Please God, let most of me be intact.”He pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail. 

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn’t care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn’t be right.

“I’m weak, I can’t do it, I’m weak, I can’t do it.” He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn’t actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn’t using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart. 

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn’t have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That’s right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn’t care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life’s blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn’t care if it killed him, as long as he died free. 

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone…

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone. 

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn’t want it to crawl back inside him. He didn’t think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn’t trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose. 

That’s when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

“You’re awake.”

“Yes.” He answered weakly.

“What happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?”

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg’s resting place.

“No, a hangnail.”

Norris laughed.

“Yeah, right.” Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

“What is it, some kind of root?” Norris asked.

“Some kind,” Reg answered.

“We need to get you inside where it’s warm.” Norris said, sounding concerned.

“No,” Reg said firmly. “First we get rid of it.”

“Okay, what would you like me to do with it?”

Reg wasn’t sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn’t matter as long as they did what was necessary.

“The compost bin,” Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

“Right,” Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

“No!” Reg shouted. “For God’s sake don’t touch it.” The thing could just be playing dead. 

“Go to the shed,” Reg instructed him, “there’s another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.”

The urgency of Reg’s tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him. 

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg’s beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

“Close the lid”, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony. 

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven’s Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

“Where do you keep your bandages, Reg?”

“Upstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.”

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris’s house was twice the size of Reg’s and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris’s handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He’d been out for 4 hours. 

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn’t like it, called the hosts as “cackling ghouls”. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

“Hello”, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff’s The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

“Sorry,” she said, and embraced him more gently.

“It’s okay.”

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

“How did you know I’d be awake?” He said, glancing at the tea.

“I didn’t, I just kept making them. That’s the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

“Ow.”

“Do you think you’re in a fit state to make those comments?”

“I am,” he said smiling.

“Why didn’t you call me?” She asked, becoming serious.

“I don’t know.” And he didn’t. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

“Silly man,” she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

“Ah you’re awake.” He said. “How are those bandages holding up?”

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

“I’ll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren’t that serious, it’s your chest I’d be worried about. You should really go to A and E.”

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death’s door you’d be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn’t fancy it.

“I’ll take my chances”, he said. “I have a good nurse.”

“Suit yourself.” Norris said, shrugging. “Make sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.”

“You patched up my wounded soldier,” Lucy said to Norris. “How will I ever repay you?”

“Don’t worry,” he said, “the tea and biscuits should cover it.”

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

“Thank you,” Reg said.

“Not at all.”

“So,” Lucy said, “Norris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?”

“That’s right,” Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

“It’s true,” Norris said. “I saw it myself. It was...” He struggled to convey it. “One for the books.” This gave him an idea. “In fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I’d just have to take some pictures...”

“No,” Reg said adamantly, “no one goes near it.”

Norris retreated. “You’re the boss,” he said. “Well, the wife has been sending me texts. She’s ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.”

“Understood,” Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro. 

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

“Reg, hun, was it really a hangnail?”

“Yes,” he said, feeling indignant.

“But how did it get so big?”

“Beats me.”

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. “You believe me don’t you, Luce?”

Whether she did or not she chose to. “Yes, hun,” she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. “Remember me?” They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy’s chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand. 

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn’t the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that. 

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces. 

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

Well, he thought, going to the shed to retrieve a trowel, in for a penny in for a pound.",1,1734010722.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

And I swear to you I have done it in the past, I did this same project last winter.

Right now I’m using Silhouette Connect from Illustrator on a super old Mac, with a Cameo Pro.

I am trying to do a print then cut from cardstock which includes score lines. I am doing the score lines with a Cricut stylus in the pen adapter in slot 1. I’m using the autoblade to cut.

Is there a way to run this as one job, where it prompts me to change the tool, successfully?

On my first attempt, the cut color was first in the line tab. But I figured it would sense that I had the pen adapter in and do the score lines or give me an error. Instead it set to work running the cut lines with the stylus. I stopped it. I was able to turn off the cut lines and run it, then independently run it with only cut lines on, so that it scanned the sensor marks each time. It was fine, but I felt it would be better if I could do it with one scan, with a tool change.

I did get it so that on the line tab, score is listed first and I set that to sketch. Then I set a pause between the two line colors for insurance. It let me change and upon resume I got the message that there was no media (I do remember having to ignore that message last year), but then when it cut, it was way off in terms of print registration, and the corners of the cuts are rounded. I’ve seen similar looks to my cuts when I have experimented with the cb09 housing set to sketch, so it seems like it is running my cut lines as a sketch action, even though they are set to cut.

Any help / tips welcome, this has proved very challenging to google. I guess I can just run each sheet twice if it comes to it. Might actually feel better than changing the tool every time since I’m making a batch.",1,1734010636.0,silhouettecameo,0,1.0,False

My Senior year of high school, I was a D.A.R.E. role model and had a great relationship with the officer who ran the program.  We got along really well, and I've been thinking about reaching out to him to talk about my career goals and get his advice.

Should I offer to buy him lunch or coffee as a thank you for his time?

Has anyone here reconnected with a former or current officer who influenced their decision to pursue a law enforcement career? I'm curious to hear how those conversations went.

1hcl5tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hcl5tf/in_for_a_penny/,In for a Penny...,"In for a pound. That was Reg’s motto. You had to finish what you started. Otherwise, what was the point? He always tried to see things through and regretted it when he didn’t. He had gone to school to study law and halfway through the first year had realised it wasn’t for him. The sticking point was having to represent someone you knew was guilty. All the best lawyers could do it but he knew deep down he wouldn’t be able to. 

Still he had stuck it out for the four years and got his degree. He had made friends he still had today and he had enough legal knowledge that when he was unfairly dismissed from the insurance firm he worked for, he was able to represent himself. He won the case and saved a bundle in legal fees.

He had stayed married to Dolores, his first wife, even after the relationship went sour. They had two kids together. Tom and Diane. A kid is an 18 year commitment but the rot in their relationship started to set in after 8. She would snipe at him, even insulting him in front of their children. He knew any love between them was gone. 

But being a Dad wasn’t a job you could quit so he stayed for another 10. Dolores was vindictive and he was more than sure that if he had divorced her, she would have taken the kids just to hurt him and he wouldn’t have seen hide nor hair of them in their teens. And those times, though turbulent, he wouldn’t trade for anything.

He even watched Game of Thrones to the end. That wasn’t easy. Then at a role-playing convention, he had trauma bonded with another fan who had suffered through the finale. That fan, Lucy, later became his partner. She was a great person and he loved her more than he could articulate. Life kept teaching him that it was good to see things through. In for a penny, in for a pound.

Maybe it was curiosity that made him stay to the end. He remembered a book he had read. The Incredible Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson. He wasn’t really enjoying it. It was a depressing tale about a man who is exposed to a gas that makes him shrink and shrink.

His wife forgets about him and keeps him in the basement. On his shrinking journey he has a brief romance with a little woman from a visiting circus but he shrinks past her too. In the basement he gets so small that he has to fight for his life against spiders, using a pencil as a spear. 

Things looked bleak. Every time he went to sleep he would wake up smaller again. He was now miniscule and thought this night would be his last. But this time when he wakes up he has passed over to the subatomic realm where an exciting new frontier of adventure awaits.

Reg was glad he had kept reading to the end.

The philosophy of seeing things through had served him well in his 45 years but Reg’s brother Pat was a different story. Pat never finished anything. He dropped out of his English degree because the other students were too pretentious. He quit his job as a tour guide because his boss was an asshole. Reg tried to tell him, most bosses are assholes but it didn’t seem to matter. You put up with it, you do impressions of them in the break room, then you go home and put work behind you.

Reg had watched Pat break it off with girlfriend after girlfriend for the flimsiest of reasons. This one wasn’t funny enough, or smart enough. They had too many “red flags” but to Reg the flags looked pink. The same kind of little flaws everyone had. 

One lady, who he knew Pat regretted dumping. Her name was Alice. She was gorgeous, kind and great craic. However, she was always about 20 minutes late. “What’s the big deal?” Reg had asked his brother. “Just read a book, go on your phone.” But no, she was imperfect so she had to go.

After all the quitting and dropping out, Pat ended up without much of a life to show for it. No family, no job, and only one friend, Reg himself. Finally he had done the ultimate dropping out, ending his life at the age of 43. 

Amidst the maelstrom of grief, Reg kept coming back to the same question. Why kill yourself at 43 when 44 could be the year it finally all came together? Why walk out of the movie before the third act?

Reg missed him. He was a dour man, sure, but once he was done talking about his own problems he was a pretty good listener. He was also a great guy to watch a crappy dumb movie with. 

Not long after Pat did what he did, a publishing company got in touch, they wanted to publish one of his poems.With Reg’s help it was published posthumously. You just didn’t know what was around the corner.

It was a Sunday and Reg had nothing on. He intended today to be nice and relaxing. Lucy was out with her friends, at the Korean place in town. She was with her three besties and he knew they would eat Gochujang, and stay for hours, having drinks and catching each other up. 

He had the place to himself for the next few hours and he knew exactly what he would do. Listen to podcasts and finish his lego Death Star. He adored Lucy but it was nice to have some time to reflect on the week.

He had everything set up and ready to go when he hit a snag. Literally, there was something snagging on his cardigan sleeve. He carefully rolled back his sleeve and found the culprit, it was a hangnail, protruding from the left side of his left thumb. Irritating but nothing he couldn’t deal with. 

He had a system. He would fill a small dish with warm water and soak the nail to soften it. Then taking his trusty tweezers, he’d rip the bugger out. He prepared his surgical bay, placing the dish and tweezer on the arm of the couch. The whole thing shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and soon he would be in his lego happy place.

His phone connected to a bluetooth speaker and the familiar jingle of the podcast intro rang out. It was his favourite, Pod People. It was dedicated to the dark side of life. True crime, cults, conspiracies and the like. 

This episode was dedicated to the terrifying case of Josef Frizel, who kept his daughter locked in a basement for 24 years, where he raped her and fathered children with her. He felt a twinge of guilt at listening to something like that but reassured himself that he wasn’t the only one, or the podcast wouldn’t be popular.

The hosts were two American friends, one Christian and the other into death metal. They had a running gag where the wholesome one would accuse the other of getting off on the macabre stories. Listening to it felt like being in the same room with some good friends. 

He set a timer on his watch and soaked his thumb, removing it after 2 minutes. He took the tweezers, the same ones he used to pluck his unibrow, and gripped the extruding end of the hangnail.

He winced at the pain he knew was coming. But it was necessary. A hangnail would seriously affect his dexterity when it came to building the movie accurate exhaust channels of the Death Star. The errant keratin would have to go. 

He braced himself and pulled. He felt the expected pain, saw the expected blood, but felt none of the expected relief. Dabbing away the blood he saw the hangnail was still attached, now jutting from the joint in his thumb. He paused, his mind working. This was a turn up for the books. He had never known a hangnail to extend this far and he examined it with fresh curiosity.

How was it even possible? Wasn’t the soil of a hangnail, so to speak, the nail bed? Could this be growing from some place deeper? The bone maybe? Thoughts of soil turned his attention to his garden. He looked out the living room window which gave a view of the back garden. 

It was a modest 5 by 7 metres with a small tool shed. He took particular pride in his roses. Scarlet Carsons. They were sleeping right now but he looked forward to spring when they would break free with their customary bold shade of red.

He wanted to turn his attention to happy things, lego, the garden, maybe a nice cup of tea, but the hangnail was now hogging all of it. The laughter of the podcast hosts grated on him and he realised he would not be able to really relax until He dealt with it. 

It was a hangnail, just a particularly long one, so the solution was the same, pull it out. It would be a funny story to tell Lucy when she got home. Perhaps he would even keep it and show it to her, though that would be cruel, as she didn’t like ghastly things.

He took the tweezers and started to pull. It was deeper than he expected and felt like ripping a cable from underground. All he could do was keep pulling, in a continuous motion, hoping that at any moment it would be torn free. He watched in confused horror as it kept going....showing no signs of reaching an end. Feeling light-headed and needing a break from the pain and exertion, he stopped, although the sought for relief was nowhere, the thing was still attached.

This was becoming...unacceptable. He felt sadness as he felt the prospect of an easy Sunday slipping away. The hangnail now emerged from the base of his thumb, at the place where his thumb met his hand. It was almost two inches in length. At a loss he decided to google it. Using one hand to work his phone while the other awaited its fate.

Google offered no salvation. People had hangnails that had to be surgically removed. There was also something called bone slivers but they only happened in serious accidents where the bone was shattered. He looked at the pictures with morbid fascination. They were horrifying but didn’t look like what was happening to him. 

While on the phone he got distracted and bought a book he didn’t need. He knew he was procrastinating and he had to deal with this before he coud return to his life. 

He grabbed the hangnail, it was long enough now that he didn’t need the tweezers and could use his other hand, and began to pull. The pain was...intimate. He felt like a robot that had gone crazy and was pulling out its own wires. 

The podcast hosts started to advertise a health drink. He didn’t want to let go of the nail so he couldn’t skip it which added to his torture. He had seen the drink on YouTube, it was green and looked like something you would give a sick cow.

He had to stop again and when he did the hangnail (if it could still be called that) was sticking out of his wrist. Just above the strap of his casio digital watch, which he removed. To his amazement he realised that he would actually have to remove his shirt as it still wasn’t over. 

He had to drag the sleeve over the hangnail and his fresh wound, causing a cruel jolt of pain. He threw the shirt aside. There was a wellspring of blood and the paper towel couldn’t cope, it was completely red with blood except for one white corner. He would need a towel.

He went to the hot press to get one. On the way he left red spots where his blood dropped on the living room carpet. He would be in trouble when Lucy found them. He found a white and red tea towel and wrapped it around his arm. 

He noticed how calm he was being but he knew he was like that, anxious most of the time but calm when the shit hit the fan. He sat back down on the couch, holding his hand in the towel like he was afraid it would fall off. The absurdity of the whole thing made him laugh.

He cleaned up the blood as best he could then used the towel to get extra purchase on the nail. In for a penny in for a pound. He started a new round of pulling. The uprooted nail dug a trench down his arm as he pulled it out. He screamed from the pain, which was like hot needles driven though his bone. He had to keep screaming to keep going. 

He wondered if the neighbours could hear. Norris, the man living next door, was a retired doctor. Rationally he knew he should be seeking medical help. Maybe it was some macho programming but he just wanted to take care of the nail himself without getting anyone else involved. The nail was now almost at the joint of his elbow, he could wrap it around his right hand to get a good grip. Doing so made him gag.

He took a second to rest and breath deeply. The thing was now almost at his shoulder. He could see the carnage he was wreaking on himself but he resisted his mind’s attempts to comprehend it, knowing it would probably steal all his conviction. Every single inch had been hard won, like ground in World War 1. With destroyed flesh the casualties.

He tried to pull again but this time the pain far outweighed any progress. He shifted it maybe a millimetre and was rewarded with an artillery shell of pain that hit his shoulder but sent shrapnel everywhere else. It also blasted away his resolve. 

I just need a second, he thought and leaned over face down on the couch. His nose was pressed against the cushion and he could smell the smell of the house. There was a faint hint of the curry he and Lucy had had last night.

Thinking of Lucy cut even deeper and he produced a little sob. When crying he never managed to get out more of a sob or two before something stopped him. That macho programming again. He’d give anything to be in her arms. Telling her about this rather than actually going through it. He thought of her coming home and finding him in this posture of defeat, and he hated it so he sat up.

Thoughts of defeat led to thoughts of capitulation. Maybe he and the nail could co-exist. He could cut it off at the shoulder, keep it covered under clothes and trim it every now and then. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 

No, he drove out the thoughts. He couldn’t trust the nail. What if it wasn’t content with his flesh? What if one night as he slept it inched its way towards Lucy, searching for new lands to colonise. No, no peace. There was only room in his body for one of them.

His brain tuned back into the podcast. They were aughing at what that woman had gone through. How could they? He thought. Didn’t they know people were suffering?! Still he didn’t turn it off. Somehow he thought the silence would be worse. Just then he got the notion that running his arm under a cold tap would do the world of good, would cure him in fact.

He went into the kitchen and placed his arm under the tap. He looked at the water because he couldn’t bring himself to look at his arm. It ran red for much longer than he would have liked. He didn’t like that he was being afraid so he forced himself to look. What he saw made him throw up. It looked like he had shaken hands with a combine harvester.

He stood by the sink, the tap still running, washing away a rancid cocktail of vomit and blood. the taste of vomit in his mouth. It felt good to get it out of him but he knew he’d never feel right again until he got *it* out of him.

How long had it been in him, he wondered. Reg had always had a bad constitution, getting sick every flu season, tiring easily. Was it because this stowaway was there all along, taking the nutrients that were rightfully his to fuel its abominable growth? 

Reg’s curiosity was enflamed. How far did the thing go? He would find out, even if it killed him. He turned off the tap and dried himself with a mostly clean tea towel. The one he had gotten previously lay on the counter, soaked with blood and useless. He hated to think about how much flesh he had lost and how much more he would lose before the day was over.

To ensure victory he would need better weaponry. His thoughts turned to the garden shed where he kept his DIY stuff. His mind was filled with images from an old movie. In it the character loses his hand, then goes to the toolshed and with a few adjustments transforms himself into a killing machine with a chainsaw for a hand. He thought a chainsaw would be overkill but he still liked the imagery.

“You’ve got a big surprise coming to you” he said to the hangnail. It was approaching 2 feet in length. It had a stiffness to it and bobbed alongside his arm like a sinister erection. Just looking at it made his stomach lurch. He went to the backdoor and put on his coat and boots to go outside. 

Blood from his arm stuck to the lining inside the coat and the numbness in his left hand made lacing his boots difficult. It overcast outside, Mid-December in Ireland. Despite human attempts to derail it, Nature was keeping to her schedule and had made it chilly.

On his way to the shed he stopped by the rosebed. There was nothing to see and he wondered if he’d be alive to see his beloved roses bloom. He opened the door to the shed, or armory as he thought of it. He took his red toolbox from a shelf and placed it on the worktop. He rummaged around for the pliers, feeling a sadistic pleasure thinking of what he could do to the hangnail.

Then his eyes landed on something that stopped him searching and made him grin. In the centre of the worktop was a vice. What better tool to hold the damned thing in place while he ripped it out of him.

Knowing he would lose his nerve if he hesitated he guided the hangnail into the jaws of the vice and turned the wheel. The nail was thin so he had to turn the wheel all the way to clamp it in place. 

He realised the best thing to do was to sling the hangnail over his shoulder and turn away from the vice. That way when he moved forward he could rip it out. The shed was small and he was able to reach out and get the fingers of his right hand around the door handle. He was glad at how secure it felt.

He was atheist except for the most dire occasions and he mentally whispered a prayer. “Please God, let most of me be intact.”He pulled himself forward. The nail bit into him and scared it might re-enter him that way he found an old sheet used for painting, folded it into a kind of belt and placed it under the nail. 

He dragged himself forward again. It felt unnatural to cause himself so much pain, like asking a maniac to stab him in the chest.

Gouts of blood splashed onto the ground. With the nail slung over his shoulder he was reminded of the Strongman competitions he used to watch with his father and brother when he was a boy. He didn’t care much for sports but they had enough of the freak show to be fun. He thought now of those mountains of men, dragging train cars behind them. In their teeth he seemed to remember but that couldn’t be right.

“I’m weak, I can’t do it, I’m weak, I can’t do it.” He thought. Yet he was doing it. His mind was useless in this situation. It was only his will that mattered. He assessed the damage, there was a meaty canyon extending from his shoulder to his left nipple. He couldn’t actually see his nipple which might have been in laying with the blood on the ground. Oh well, he thought, I wasn’t using it anyway. The nail looked stronger than ever, its base an inch across and slightly concave. It had some nerve, acting like it was a normal part of his anatomy!

It was obvious where the final showdown would be. His heart. The soil where it gorged itself on his blood. Its roots like a cage around his heart. 

He kept pulling forward. It was like the nail was bonded to him at the molecular level and ripping it out split the atom, triggering atomic explosions of pain. He kept pulling himself forward. In for a penny...

His consciousness wavered and he held onto the door handle as much to keep himself awake as upright. His body begged for a chance to shut down. He didn’t have to look to know the hangnail was now coming straight from his heart, like a knife left by an unfaithful lover. It was only when he stopped screaming that he realised he had been. Somewhere in the distance he heard a lawnmower. That’s right. It was Sunday. Lazy Sunday.

His chest was almost level with the door now. So he opened it and let himself fall to the ground. As he fell he heard something snap as one of the nails moorings broke. The pain was like a point blank gunshot but he didn’t care, it was his first taste of freedom.

He could feel a puddle of blood underneath him, like taking a hot bath in the November air. This was the heart blood, life’s blood. He could feel the satanic claw of the nail loosen its grip. He didn’t care if it killed him, as long as he died free. 

He resumed pulling, and screaming. He was grateful for the money he had spent on the vice, which prior to now had mostly been used to crack walnuts. He grabbed handfuls of dirt and grass and dragged himself forward with strength that must have been drawn from the earth itself. He was numb to the pain, numb to the damage he was inflicting on himself, deaf to his own screams, he just wanted it gone…

He awoke and knew it was over. It was gone. He felt empty. Like a gutted fish. He could feel wind howling in the empty spaces inside himself where the nail had been. But it was gone. 

In a panic he looked around to check where it was. He didn’t want it to crawl back inside him. He didn’t think he could face another round. It lay in a black circle of blood soaked earth. It looked desiccated, like a dead spider. Looked dead, but he didn’t trust that. The base of it, where it had infiltrated his heart, looked like a mockery of a heart made out of twisted thorns.

He looked down at his chest and saw the sheet he had used had been remade as a bandage to cover the gaping wound. It was soaked through red. Although he could still see the little flakes of white paint. The part near his heart was crumpled up and looked just like a rose. 

That’s when he noticed there were arms around him. Lucy? No, they were a man's arms. White and strewn with freckles. They held him up in a sitting position. The owner of the arms spoke and it was Norris, his next door neighbour who must have come when he heard screaming.

“You’re awake.”

“Yes.” He answered weakly.

“What happened? Was it an accident with one of the tools?”

He must have seen the trail of blood from the shed to Reg’s resting place.

“No, a hangnail.”

Norris laughed.

“Yeah, right.” Norris said.

Reg gestured to the remains of the hangnail.

“What is it, some kind of root?” Norris asked.

“Some kind,” Reg answered.

“We need to get you inside where it’s warm.” Norris said, sounding concerned.

“No,” Reg said firmly. “First we get rid of it.”

“Okay, what would you like me to do with it?”

Reg wasn’t sure if Norris was just humoring him. But it didn’t matter as long as they did what was necessary.

“The compost bin,” Reg said, pointing to the end of the garden where there was a large black rectangular bin.

“Right,” Norris said, gently lowering Reg down. Reg continued to watch him, using a herculean effort to keep his head raised. Norris reached for the hangnail.

“No!” Reg shouted. “For God’s sake don’t touch it.” The thing could just be playing dead. 

“Go to the shed,” Reg instructed him, “there’s another sheet. You can use it to wrap it up. Carefully.”

The urgency of Reg’s tone must have gotten through to him and Reg was glad to see Norris now approached the nail with proper caution. Taking the sheet he gingerly wrapped it while being careful not to touch it himself. Norris took the mummified form over to the compost bin and lifted the lid. Reg watched him so closely that Norris could feel his eyes on him. 

Reg took composting seriously and the compost bin was big, about half the size of a skip. Layers of decaying matter would be left there for months until they turned into a rich fertiliser that was destined for Reg’s beloved rose bed. It would make a good tomb for his foe.

Norris dropped the nail inside.

“Close the lid”, Reg said.

Norris came back over to Reg. Swiping his hands together to signify a job well done. He helped Reg to his feet and carried him wounded soldier style back into the welcoming warmth of the living room. With a great delicacy he managed to get him onto the couch with only minimal agony. 

The couch, where the whole nightmare had begun, what seemed like an eternity ago. The podcast was still going but had moved on to another episode, this one about the Heaven’s Gate cult. He knew all about it but still he let it play.

“Where do you keep your bandages, Reg?”

“Upstairs bathroom, medicine cabinet.”

Norris had been in his house before and knew his way around. He had been over several times for a cup of tea. (he was the generation of Irish person where this was simply expected) He got to work and Reg could tell he felt much happier in the familiar territory of helping a patient, rather than whatever the hell had been happening with that strange root...

Reg had never thought highly of Norris, he had always seemed a bit aloof. He was a canny businessman as well as a doctor. He had purchased a floundering medical journal, restored it to glory and then sold it on for a phenomenal profit. Although they exchanged the usual neighbourly banter there was no disguising the fact Norris’s house was twice the size of Reg’s and he even had a Koi pond.

Clearly he had misjudged him because here he was, helping him in his time of need. You never knew who would be there for you. It was mid-way through these reflections that Reg passed out again.

He awoke to the sound of gentle mirth and clinking spoons from the kitchen. Lucy was home. The knowledge of that flooded him like a powerful tranquilizer. The haphazard dressing on his chest had given way to more expert bandaging. Norris’s handiwork. It was dark out. He checked his watch. He’d been out for 4 hours. 

The podcast was silent. Lucy didn’t like it, called the hosts as “cackling ghouls”. There was a steaming hot mug on the coffee table. He picked it up, the small movement was like doing the last rep at the gym but he was rewarded with a soothing sip of tea. Ah, tea, nectar of the gods.

“Hello”, he called out, announcing his presence.

Lucy entered the room. He blinked away tears and held out his arms, feeling like Karloff’s The Mummy. She hugged him tightly and he yelped.

“Sorry,” she said, and embraced him more gently.

“It’s okay.”

Tears stung his eyes as he gave in to the feeling of being looked after.

“How did you know I’d be awake?” He said, glancing at the tea.

“I didn’t, I just kept making them. That’s the fifteenth one. I wanted you to have something hot when you woke up.”

“Oh, I do,” he said, winking.

She shook him gently and he felt waves of pain emanating from his track of wounds.

“Ow.”

“Do you think you’re in a fit state to make those comments?”

“I am,” he said smiling.

“Why didn’t you call me?” She asked, becoming serious.

“I don’t know.” And he didn’t. Why not enlist her help in battle? She was his greatest ally after all.

“Silly man,” she said and leaned in for a kiss. Norris entered with impeccable timing. He held a cup of tea and wore a friendly smile. Lucy pulled away.

“Ah you’re awake.” He said. “How are those bandages holding up?”

He came over to Reg and started expertly tugging at the bandages. He seemed satisfied. He entered Doctor mode:

“I’ll be back tomorrow to change them. The ones on your arm aren’t that serious, it’s your chest I’d be worried about. You should really go to A and E.”

Reg shook his head. The Irish healthcare system was a complete shambles. Unless you were actually knocking down death’s door you’d be waiting 10 hours to be seen. In a cold waiting room with fluorescent lights, surrounded by strangers. He didn’t fancy it.

“I’ll take my chances”, he said. “I have a good nurse.”

“Suit yourself.” Norris said, shrugging. “Make sure you get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.”

“You patched up my wounded soldier,” Lucy said to Norris. “How will I ever repay you?”

“Don’t worry,” he said, “the tea and biscuits should cover it.”

And you have enough money already, Reg thought and felt bad for thinking it. Money or not he was obviously a caring man. Feeling deep gratitude, Reg held out his hand to Norris who accepted it.

“Thank you,” Reg said.

“Not at all.”

“So,” Lucy said, “Norris said this was all caused by a hangnail? Is that right?”

“That’s right,” Reg said.

Lucy was incredulous.

“It’s true,” Norris said. “I saw it myself. It was...” He struggled to convey it. “One for the books.” This gave him an idea. “In fact, it would make a hell of an entry in the journal. Of course, I’d just have to take some pictures...”

“No,” Reg said adamantly, “no one goes near it.”

Norris retreated. “You’re the boss,” he said. “Well, the wife has been sending me texts. She’s ready to send out search and rescue. I better be off. Thanks for the tea, Lucy. Reg, mind yourself. No more life and death battles, for a while at least.”

“Understood,” Reg said.

Norris left by the front door, exchanging a string of goodbyes with Lucy as he went. With Norris out of the way Lucy gave him his deferred kiss. It too was one for the books and made the whole day of fighting seem worth it. She helped him up the stairs which had somehow transformed into Kilimanjaro. 

He got into bed with her, something that never failed to make him giddy, despite the 5 years they had been together. Under the covers, she began to talk to him in the conspiratorial whisper he knew well.

“Reg, hun, was it really a hangnail?”

“Yes,” he said, feeling indignant.

“But how did it get so big?”

“Beats me.”

There was a silence into which he felt like interjecting lots of things, but they all felt impolite. Finally he found what he wanted to say. “You believe me don’t you, Luce?”

Whether she did or not she chose to. “Yes, hun,” she said, and gave him an affirming kiss on the head.

She went to sleep quickly, as was her way, and he was left with the pain which was like a chorus of voices, vying for his attention. “Remember me?” They seemed to say. He found by resting his head against Lucy’s chest he could quiet them, and like this he slept.

It was March. A Sunday. Reg had taken the last 3 months off as sick leave but was scheduled to return Tomorrow. He looked forward to the return of normalcy. He stood in the living room, hot cup of tea in hand. 

The blood stains in the carpet had long since been cleaned. Lucy had put up a show of complaining but he suspected she was glad it wasn’t the outline of his body she was cleaning.

He felt like a new man after getting the nail out. There was a spring in his step and some days he felt 25 rather than the 45 he was. He guessed not having an unwelcome passenger siphoning his lifeforce would do that. 

He had finished the lego Death Star and a number of other builds as well. Including Mt. Doom from Lord of the Rings which was over 7,000 pieces. 

People asked him what his secret was and he felt like telling them it was buried in the back garden. He looked out at the rose bed. He was delighted to see small green dots that showed they were starting to bud. Lucy had been applying fresh compost during his convalescence and it had done its job. He marvelled at nature, its resilience and immortality.

He noticed something else sticking out of the soil, whitish grey, and curved like a banana. A piece of trash that had blown over the wall he assumed. He went outside to pick it up. He wanted his roses pristine. His heart froze when he saw what it really was. The nail. Alive and about the thickness of his wrist, it extended about a foot from the soil and pointed at him threateningly.

1hcl53g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hcl53g/blood_test_help_just_a_tired_woman_looking_for/,Blood test help? Just a tired woman looking for answers,"I (35F) am looking for advice until I see my doctor for a follow up next week. For about three years I've been dealing with stomach pain (upper right or left side), fatigue, headaches, coldness even on a warm day, purple under my eyes and sometimes on my lips/hands/feet/, and sometimes difficulty catching my breath (when jogging or climbing multiple stairs). Back in August I had a regular blood test come back with low hemoglobin, low ferritin, etc all indicating iron deficiency anemia. 

I was regularly donating whole blood every 2-3 months until July of this year. I would take a slow release iron supplement 40mg with vitamin c for two weeks before my blood donation appointments. It seemed to help... until it didn't and I failed my hemoglobin twice in a row two weeks apart. It was then that I decided to discuss with a doctor. 

I've been taking iron pills every day or every other day since July besides when I had my colonoscopy/EGD in September. Everything came back normal on the colonoscopy. But the EGD showed signs of Gerd. So now I'm taking 40mg omneprezole. It had improved my swallowing. I had issues from June until August ish where I'd eat and suddenly.. I couldn't swallow. Then it started to happen with water. It was not a common occurrence but it scared me. A few seconds after I couldn't swallow, I'd suddenly be able to. No one around me would notice this was happening. 

My blood tests were redone yesterday. I'm still very tired but have had no stomach pain during this time. My ferritin and hemoglobin increased 1 each. I'm now a 9 in ferritin and 12 for hemoglobin. There's no known excessive bleeding (i don't even have a period since January 2024 when my physician switched me to slynd 4mg after having migraine with auras).

My blood tests also revealed normal b12 (612) levels, and deficient vitamin d (hydroxyvitamin d total by lcms is 21). High sed rate (77 it was 78 in August), white blood cell normal (6.2), red blood cell (5.95), hemoglobin (12.1), hematocrit (41.8), mean cell volume (70.3), mean cell hemoglobin (20.3), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (28.9), red cell distribution width (20.3), mean platelet volume (10.5), platelet (379), iron (25),  total iron binding capacity (480), iron saturation (5), transferrin (336).

Other relevant info: I get bi-annual corticosteroid shots in my right big toe joint for bone spurs. Back in 2012 I had foot surgery on this toe that showed calcified potassium deposits or pseudogout. The surgery was initially for a bunion removal but i didn't actually have a bunion. I was only 23 at the time and I don't eat tons of red meat or anything. The doctor was a little stumped. My podiatrist thinks this is relevant to share with my doctor as it could be a factor in the high sed rate. 

Also,  I have two kids no miscarriage. My youngest had complications and I was induced for pre-eclampsia at 35 weeks approximately five years ago. I then had postpartum eclampsia 24 hrs after delivery caught by extend left leg swelling, I was put on a low dose blood pressure medicating for 3 weeks before my blood pressure dropped and they took me off the medication. No other history of high BP. My mom has crohns, high bp, a fib, and i think that's it. My dad's family (uncle, grandparents) have history of diabetes (i don't my a1c was normal in August). Cancer runs in my family that ranges pretty much cover everything possible. Back in 2011 i had repeatedly tested for pre cancer 1 then 2 for cervical cancer simple squamous cells. 2011 i believe i did the cryosurgery. No issues since. 

I thought i eat fairly healthy. I eat salads or rice bowls with veggies and chicken for lunch. I enjoy walking at least 4x a week 30 min to an hour. I started lifting weights in the last year but only once a week or so. I get very very tired after lifting. I'm gluten sensitive found in a blood test six years ago. I've been gluten free since. My colonoscopy did not show celiac (but I did not eat gluten as I haven't for years and no one told me I should eat it before the colonoscopy).

Over the last two weeks, I've noticed myself nodding off at work only one or two times in a week. I drink coffee every morning (espresso triple shot) and some days I drink 100-200mg energy drinks in the early afternoon as a pick me up because I'm tired or i know i have an event after work like a dinner party or sports event for my kids that i need to attend. I feel tired within a few hours or even minutes of waking. And some days I feel so depleted of energy, it's hard for me to motivate to go on a walk. I'd say that this fatigue is starting to impact my quality of living. It's getting slowly worse. Oh and I wake with a headache most days. But I don't take anything for it unless I get those sharp pains in my temples or front of my head. I do get enough sleep each night -7-9 hours mostly light sleep per my Samsung watch which who knows how accurate that is, right?

Lastly,  I weigh around 150 lbs and I'm 5'5"". I have a history of anorexia from my teen years (20 ish years ago). It lasted about six years. I don't think it's relevant, but just in case you needed to know... 

Oh and I'm August, my doctor brought up iron transfusions. I'm trying to avoid that. 

What should I be doing differently? Is there something I should ask my doctor? Any recommendations? How do I stop feeling so tired? I'm starting to become concerned about it getting worse with the feeling so exhausted, and what if I can't perform as well at work (desk job at a finance company in a senior position)?

1hcl20k,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteNerds/comments/1hcl20k/a_students_guide_to_getting_better_sleep_even/,A Student’s Guide to Getting Better Sleep (Even During Finals),"All through the school year, and especially during **finals week**, students struggle to prioritize rest against the pressure to study. Despite the common perception that all-nighters are a necessary evil of student life, the reality is that adequate sleep is crucial for optimal brain function and overall health.

So, how can you balance the demands of your studies with the need for quality sleep? Here are some practical tips for **better sleep habits**. 

# Understand the Importance of Sleep

Recognizing the importance of quality sleep is the first step toward prioritizing it in your routine. Not only does sleep play a vital role in brain function, concentration and health (all important during finals week), but it’s also the time your brain uses to consolidate what you’ve learned during your study session. So, sacrificing sleep hours for extra study time can actually be counterproductive. 

In short, to perform at your best, both physically and mentally, you need a good night’s sleep. Remember, sleep isn’t the enemy of study, but rather, its partner.

# Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule

Create a regular sleep schedule and strive to stick to it, even during finals. Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep each night and set a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. This routine helps regulate your body’s internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up naturally. Do your best to maintain this routine throughout your weekends, and set a firm out time for your study sessions. 

# Create a Sleep-Friendly Environment

While challenging in the dorms, do your best to design a sleeping environment that promotes restful sleep. Try to keep your room cool, quiet and dark, and consider using earplugs, eye masks or white noise machines to block out any distractions. Additionally, don’t work or study in your bed. This helps your brain associate that space with rest, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

# Develop a Wind-Down Routine

Having a regular routine before bed can signal to your brain that it’s time to sleep. Start unwinding at least 30 minutes before your desired bedtime. Limit screen time, dim the lights, take a warm shower, journal or listen to relaxing music. It’s especially helpful to maintain this routine during finals week, as you’ll help bring down your cortisol levels before hitting the hay. 

# Limit Caffeine

While you’ll likely be compelled to fuel yourself with caffeine during finals week, it’s important to remember that caffeine can stay in your system for up to eight hours.  Make sure to cut yourself off at least six hours before bed. This means no coffee, soda or energy drinks after 4pm if you want to be asleep by ten. Keep yourself hydrated and take walks to boost your energy levels without harming your sleep.

# Avoid Blue Light

Blue light emitted from phones, laptops and TV screens can disrupt your circadian rhythm and delay the release of sleep-inducing hormones. Try to power down electronics at least an hour before bed. Use apps that tint your screen orange instead of blue at night (or schedule your device’s screen to night mode if available).

# Nap Strategically

There’s no reason to pull an all-nighter to study, just as it’s unnecessary to charge through the day studying intensely with no breaks whatsoever. Short, 20–30 minute “power naps” can improve alertness when studying. Avoid napping too late in the day, however. Later naps can disrupt nighttime sleep. Instead, nap early and keep it under 30 minutes to avoid feeling groggy. 

# Limit Heavy Meals

Eating a big meal too close to bedtime can disturb your sleep, so have dinner at least two to three hours before heading to bed. When studying at a dining hall or restaurant, stick to light fare and water. If you wake up during the night, do your best to avoid the temptation of midnight snacks, as this can signal to your body that it’s time to start the day.

# Sleep Easy and Ace Those Finals 

Focusing on small and sustainable adjustments, you build healthy sleep habits which will benefit you all semester. By establishing better sleep routines and habits now, you can get the rest you need to think clearly, remember information and perform your best on your exams. ",1,1734010000.0,WriteNerds,0,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is one of the most sought-after cosmetic procedures, and for good reason. Many people dream of having a brighter smile that boosts their confidence. But what really happens in the journey of teeth whitening? Exploring real stories from users can paint a vivid picture of the impact of teeth whitening before and after the procedure.

Many individuals start their whitening journey with a simple goal: to get rid of stains caused by coffee, tea, or tobacco. Before initiating treatment, they may feel self-conscious about their yellowing teeth. This feeling can significantly affect their social interactions and overall self-esteem.

Users often report a remarkable transformation. Here are some key observations from real stories:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Increased Confidence:** A common theme among users is heightened self-esteem. People frequently share how they feel more confident smiling in photos or engaging in social situations.
- **Impact on Relationships:** Many users have mentioned how others perceive them differently after whitening their teeth. Compliments from friends and family often reinforce their newfound confidence.
- **Routine Changes:** After whitening, some individuals feel motivated to improve their oral hygiene. They may start flossing regularly or scheduling more frequent dental check-ups.

It's interesting to note that users' results can vary depending on the method of whitening they choose. The most common methods include professional treatments at a dentist's office, take-home kits, and over-the-counter products. Here’s how these options differ:

- **Professional Treatments:** Many report that in-office whitening provides the fastest and most noticeable results. Usually, they see drastic changes in just one session.
- **Take-Home Kits:** These kits can be effective but may take longer to show results. Users often appreciate the flexibility of whitening at their own pace.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** While readily available, results can be less predictable. Users sometimes express frustration over achieving minimal effect with these products.

Several users have detailed their experiences with the treatments. For example, a young professional named Sarah shared that she felt hesitant about her smile during job interviews. After opting for a professional whitening session, she felt empowered when she noticed her brighter smile. This newfound confidence, she explains, translated into her performance during interviews, ultimately helping her secure a new job.

Another story involves Mark, a coffee enthusiast. Over the years, he noticed his teeth becoming increasingly stained. He decided to try an at-home whitening kit. Over several weeks, he was thrilled to see a substantial difference. Mark expressed how pleased he was to be able to enjoy his favorite beverage without feeling self-conscious about his smile.

However, it's important to recognize that teeth whitening is not without its challenges. Some users have reported experiencing tooth sensitivity during or after their treatment. This is a common issue, but it usually subsides after a short time. For those with sensitive teeth, many dental professionals recommend desensitizing toothpaste or suggest postponing treatment until sensitivity diminishes.

Ultimately, the impact of teeth whitening before and after varies widely among individuals, largely dependent on personal expectations and the methods they choose. Users often find sharing their experiences helpful, as these stories can guide others in their decision-making process. Encouragement and tips from fellow individuals can make navigating the options much easier.

Reflecting on the journeys of users highlights not just the cosmetic benefits of teeth whitening, but also the emotional and social aspects. While the visual impact is clear, the boost in confidence and improved self-image are perhaps the most powerful results of all.

So, if you're considering teeth whitening, think about what true transformation could mean for you. Real stories from users show that, often, it’s not just about having whiter teeth, but about feeling good about yourself and embracing all the opportunities that come with a brighter smile.

Comparing Professional Teeth Whitening vs. At-Home Kits: Which is Better?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular trend, thanks to its ability to enhance your smile and boost your confidence. Many people are faced with a choice between professional teeth whitening and at-home kits. Each option has its unique benefits and drawbacks, and understanding these can help you make an informed decision.

Professional teeth whitening typically takes place at a dental office. A dentist uses stronger bleaching agents, which deliver faster and more noticeable results. One of the significant advantages of this method is that it’s supervised by a professional who can ensure the safety and effectiveness of the process.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
**Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening:**

- **Immediate Results:** In-office treatments can produce a brighter smile in just one session, often lasting several shades lighter.
- **Custom Care:** Dentists tailor treatments to your dental needs. They assess your teeth and apply product precisely.
- **Safer Process:** With monitored procedures, the risk of gum irritation and uneven whitening is minimized.
- **Advanced Technology:** Professionals use equipment, like LED lights and lasers, which can enhance the whitening effect.

On the other hand, at-home whitening kits are widely accessible and offer convenience. These kits usually include whitening strips, gels, or trays that can be used at your leisure.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
**Benefits of At-Home Whitening Kits:**

- **Cost-Effective:** At-home kits are generally cheaper than professional services, making them more accessible to many people.
- **Convenience:** You can use these kits whenever it suits you, whether you are at home or traveling.
- **Less Sensitivity:** Many users find that at-home options may result in less sensitivity compared to strong in-office treatments.
- **Variety of Options:** There are numerous kits available, from strips to trays, allowing you to choose what works best for you.

However, at-home kits also come with some drawbacks. The results may take longer to appear, and the effects might not be as dramatic as those obtained through professional procedures. Additionally, improper use can lead to uneven results or damage to your enamel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Many individuals wonder how these methods stack up against one another. Performing side-by-side comparisons, it’s evident that both methods have their unique advantages. If you are looking for fast, dramatic results with a professional touch, an in-office treatment might be ideal. However, if you seek a more gradual approach that is budget-friendly, at-home whitening could suit you better.

Here are some key factors to consider when deciding between these two options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Time:** How quickly do you want to see results? If you need a whiter smile for an upcoming event, professional whitening is likely your best bet.
- **Budget:** Evaluate how much you are willing to spend. If budget constraints are an issue, at-home kits might be a better choice.
- **Sensitivity Levels:** If you have sensitive teeth, start by consulting your dentist. They can recommend the best course of action tailored to your comfort.
- **Long-Term Goals:** Think about how often you want to whiten your teeth. Regular touch-ups might be easier with at-home kits.

In terms of effectiveness, some studies suggest that professional treatments usually yield superior results, primarily due to the concentration of the whitening agents used. However, many users have successfully achieved satisfying results with at-home kits as well. The key is to follow the instructions carefully and be consistent with your treatments.

Ultimately, the choice between professional teeth whitening and at-home kits varies based on individual needs and preferences. Whether you value convenience or immediate results, there is an option that fits your lifestyle.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Before choosing a method, consider consulting your dentist. They can provide insights based on your unique dental health and help you navigate the array of teeth whitening products available today, ensuring a brighter smile that you can feel confident about.

### Conclusion

The journey of teeth whitening can be truly transformative, as illustrated by the real stories of users who have experienced dramatic changes in their smiles. These personal narratives highlight not only the aesthetic improvements but also the boost in confidence that often accompanies a whiter smile. Individuals report feeling more comfortable in social situations, smiling more freely, and even experiencing greater success in both personal and professional interactions.

When evaluating the methods available, comparing professional teeth whitening options with at-home kits is essential. Professional treatments, often conducted by dental experts, tend to deliver rapid and impressive results, making them ideal for special occasions or moments when you want to look your best. On the other hand, at-home kits offer convenience and affordability, allowing users to lighten their teeth at their own pace. However, results can vary, and it’s advisable to follow instructions carefully to avoid any mishaps.

Ultimately, the choice between professional whitening and at-home kits hinges on individual needs, budget, and desired outcomes. For those looking for fast, noticeable changes, professional services might be the way to go. Yet, if you're in search of a gentler, more gradual approach, at-home options can still yield significant results. Whichever route you choose, knowing what to expect from teeth whitening before and after can lead to a satisfying and life-enhancing experience. A brighter smile not only enhances appearances; it also enriches the joy of daily interactions and boosts self-esteem, making it a worthy investment in yourself.",1,1734009826.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

","broke up with my ex in April because he said he had too many responsibilities and couldn’t prioritize our relationship. He admitted that I didn’t deserve how he treated me in the final phase of our relationship and that he couldn’t give me the care and attention I deserved. The breakup left me heartbroken and miserable, especially since he acts cold when we meet each other at a coffee shop or in group settings with friends.

To heal, I decided to change my look and take a month-long trip. After returning, I meet him at a coffee shop by chance , and we ended up talking for hours. He complimented my new look and seemed much friendlier, even going out of his way to show he remembers small details about me. He buys me my favourite sweets in any occasions, looks at me the same way he did when we were together, and acts warm and attentive when we meet by chance or in group outings . Also , He seems jealous when I mention another guy's name and tries to make me feel jealous in return. He goes out of his way to stand out when I’m around in a group setting and often appears stressed. . However, he hasn’t mentioned anything about our past relationship or expressed his feelings directly.

His behavior is confusing : does he still have feelings for me but isn’t ready to express them because he’s dealing with challenges about his future , work and studies ? Or is he just trying to stay friendly to maintain harmony in our friend group?

I’m unsure how to act when we’re in the same place. I haven’t fully moved on, and being around him reminds me of the heartbreak and disappointment I felt when he left.

[Day 11 \(left\) vs Day 12 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/lop5bw984f6e1.jpg?width=4030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f275902cb3c37f7b2ed91492747f7c7ff9d04f0)



The roast is light and indistinguishable from yesterday’s in color. However, the **Pacamara varietal** makes itself known with its large, clean beans. Their aesthetic appeal adds a hint of promise that I didn’t fully unlock today.

**Aroma**

* **From the Canister**: A muted, slightly stalled aroma that didn’t excite.
* **Ground Coffee**: Rich, with notes of **dark chocolate** and a brownie-like sweetness.
* **Brewed Coffee**: Initially pleasant, with aromas of **pears**, **stone fruits**, and a touch of **strawberry**. The sweetness persisted, but the fruit notes faded quickly, leaving a simpler, more muted profile.

**Taste**

The cup began with a refreshing acidity and a light body but quickly transitioned to prune-like flavors with a short aftertaste. While the sweetness lingered nicely, the overall experience felt flat. I suspect a 1:15 ratio or an alternative brewing method—like immersion—might better showcase the beans’ potential.

It’s not that the beans themselves were disappointing; rather, my pour-over approach didn’t do them justice today. Additionally, as with many coffees in this advent calendar, I can’t help but wish these beans had been brewed at their peak freshness.

**Additional Notes**

Central American coffees, especially from El Salvador, often excel in balancing sweetness and fruitiness. This pick clearly has the foundation for a great cup, but my brewing method and approach may have masked its full character. It’s a reminder that not every day is perfect, but that’s part of the coffee journey.

Today’s cup was a case of wrong method, wrong mood—or perhaps both. The beans themselves showed promise, and with the suggested brewing methods or a different ratio, they could likely deliver a far more rewarding experience.

The only thing I’d wish for is to have these beans in their freshest state, as I suspect they’d truly shine with the right brew.

Sometimes, it’s not about the coffee but about how we choose to approach it. And that’s okay—tomorrow is another chance to discover something new.

**Interesting Fact**

El Salvador’s **Pacamara varietal** is known for its bold flavors and large bean size, but it can be tricky to brew. Developed in 1958 by crossing **Pacas** (a Salvadoran mutation of Bourbon) and **Maragogipe** (known for its large beans), Pacamara is prized for its versatility in revealing flavors through different brewing methods. Its inherent sweetness and fruitiness make it a great candidate for immersion techniques like steeped coffee, which might explain why KaffeBox recommends such methods for today’s beans.

\- - -

That was the quote that lingered in my mind. I saw it once—on a TV screen during a mental health awareness ad, which played after the show I was absentmindedly watching had ended. It stayed with me, I pondered how powerful our minds can shape our reality. The thoughts we think, beliefs we share, and our perceptions of reality aren't merely passive but actively influence how we experience and interact daily.

It had me thinking, that despite everyone living in the same physical world, billions of individual realities, cultivated by billions of other people co-exist under one shared present, does that make sense?

But what do I know? I was just a college student trying to figure things out, I still am. Truth be told, I wasn't even sure I was in the right course, so I'm fairly certain that no one should be taking my thoughts seriously about existential views regarding mankind.

Brushing off my odd late-night philosophicals, my head shifted to more important and delicious concerns—what to eat for dinner. I thought about ordering Chinese food but quickly disregarded it, due to the need to save money for my car payment, which I've been paying off since last year.

So, I settled for the next best thing—ramen noodles.

They weren't so bad—actually, not bad at all. It hit the spot for me. It might not be everyone's ideal hearty meal, but it was good enough for me.

Shortly after, I then washed the dishes, something I had done countless times—whether in the afternoon or, more often, at night. Though, the time of day didn't matter, as in front of the sink, there was this window. It wasn't an ordinary window used for admiring the view or scenery outside; its sole purpose was to expel fumes from the kitchen when someone cooked.

It stretched the full length of the sink to the drain board, with a built-in exhaust fan just above the handle. You could open the window slightly, but it wouldn't slide all the way down; it could only open halfway before being held back by the hinge.

When I peered out, all I could see was darkness—pitch black, apart from my darkened reflection. You wouldn't even know there was an identical window on the opposite side if it weren't for the rare moments when workers opened the ventilation during the day, letting in just enough light to reveal the various windows lining the vertical space from top to bottom. To me, It looked more like an empty elevator shaft than anything else, but except for elevator doors it had windows.

Well, I guess I am partially to blame in choosing where to live in the building, when I did a quick tour of the vacant spaces, I chose the one with an ominous window, instead of an apartment with a kitchen that didn't face a black void. Sure, I could've splurged for a better space with a scenic view, or a better building in general, but that was out of the question. I was on a tight budget, and a good view wasn't exactly a priority standard at that time.

That night, when it came time for me to wind down and get ready for bed I saw from my living room window that it was pouring rain outside, that explained the pitter-pattering I kept hearing as I had dinner, but paid no mind to. I watched the street, empty and desolate in the dead of night as the heavy rain poured on the pavement and the lifeless road, how the droplets of rain flowed with the direction of the strong winds blowing through the air, the trees swaying its leaves and branches along the gushing winds, it was then made clear to me it wasn't just a heavy rainy night, outside before me was a storm in place.

I felt taken aback by the sudden alarm that emitted from my phone, the sounds of panicked sirens repeatedly ringing from inside the phone's speaker, as the phone's LED light illuminated my dimly-lit features, my brows furrowed as I read;

. . .

*9:32 PM*

'Emergency Alert'

**National Weather Service:** A STORM SURGE WARNING is in effect for Richmond, VA until 4:00 AM. Take action now to protect life and property. Avoid flood-prone areas.

. . .

I looked out the window once more at the empty, desolate streets, saturated by the storm's relentless rain. The rainwater cascaded down the street, flowing over the pavement in sheets. It was obvious that the storm wasn't going to let up anytime soon. As I lay in bed, the steady rhythm of the rain took on a surprisingly therapeutic quality, offering a strange sense of calm amidst the storm's fury.

I felt truly at peace for a moment. The rain's pitter-patter had grown louder compared to earlier, when I barely noticed it. With my head nestled snugly on the pillow, I tried to surrender to sleep, letting the gentle rhythm of the rain lull me into a deep, restorative slumber, enjoying one of the best rests I had in quite some time.

Later that week, as early December settled in, my air-conditioning started to leak, well it had began leaking the morning after the storm, thus I had to keep a bucket underneath, and upon testing its functions I came to a realization that it had broke during the night. Fortunately, winter made the lack of cooling less of an issue, though the building manager had ghosted my text.

At some point black spots began to grow on the grills, dark, jagged blotches creeping across the metal, resembling ink bleeding through paper, though I tried cleaning, but it smudged and made more of a nuisance for myself to get rid of as it turned the white paint surrounding it dirtier.

The unit I rented out wasn't designed to expel heat like some of the others, so I had no problems with a heater, unlike other tenants. However, one problem did remain: the leak. While it wasn't as bad as when the storm first hit, it just persisted. I spoke to the maintenance guy, hoping that bringing it up might speed up the process, but all he told me was that there were delays in repairs. Apparently, I wasn't the only one dealing with water leakage—whilst other units were reporting problems with their heating system.

Despite the issues with my apartment not functioning properly, I found myself brushing off those minor inconveniences. Something else had been bothering me entirely. Over the past few days, I've felt increasingly unsettled in my own space, for the past few days I began to experience the same day to day occurrences I used to get, when I lived with my own family—extra dishes to clean that I don't recall using, dirt and smudges on the floor I'm certain I didn't cause, missing food items from the fridge that I was sure I had just bought.

These little signs that made me feel as if somebody else lived with me was subtle at first, I even began to think I was just starting to forget easily, early dementia, maybe? No that would've been easier to deal with.

What unnerved me the most in the days since the storm were the footsteps I started hearing at night outside my bedroom door. Normally, it was quiet, and I'd curl up with a book in the dim, cozy light of my room, or maybe scroll through messages from friends and family. But now, I found myself huddled under the covers, eyes fixed on the thin strip of light beneath the door, where a quick shadow occasionally passed, accompanied by the wet tap of bare feet on the cold floor, resembling water droplets hastily falling onto a half-full bucket.

Growing up, I wasn't one to easily believe in ghost stories, but I wasn't a full-blown skeptic either. When faced with something I can't explain, I'm not so dense as to just ignore it and brush it off as unscientific. That part of me is what made it so hard to leave my room at night. It felt ridiculous—here I was, a grown man who'd been living alone for almost two years, struggling to muster the courage to go to the bathroom because I believed there was a ghosts in my apartment, how pathetic.

The prospect of moving out was bleak, so whether I was being haunted or not, I couldn't let whatever this was deter me from living normally. Thus, I found my hand gripping on the handle as I unlocked the door, letting the light from the hallway slowly fill up my darkened room; of course I saw nothing, I simply let out sigh of relief and made my way towards the bathroom near my living room. What did I expect upon opening that door? did I expect a dead ghost from a past century to jump me before I could take a leak?

Walking down the hallway, my gaze was mainly fixed on to the floor, while the warm glow from the lights above washed over the space; it being the only source of light in the entire apartment. Just as my hand hovered over the bathroom light switch, my fingertips grazing the cold plastic, I had paused right then and there.

My gaze shifted beyond the kitchen, and towards the window. A light—no, not from inside my apartment, but outside the kitchen window, directly opposite from my own. It shone like a rectangular beacon in the darkness, catching my eye even from where I stood in the hallway, far removed from its source.

Taken aback, I shook myself from the brief trance as I had stepped into the bathroom. Even when I tried to rationalize what had occurred, my mind kept circling back to that light. What could it have been? As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine. It wasn't even possible someone had moved in recently without me noticing, as I would've heard the commotion, so the only option left could be, maybe Mr. Grant was fixing the place up?... at two in the morning. Still, whatever it was, it didn't seem to matter anymore.

Exiting the bathroom, I realized that the light was gone. My kitchen was once again cloaked in darkness, illuminated only by the faint glow from the only light source from the hall. However, just as I walked back to my room, I could've sworn I saw something—a movement in my periphery, the shifts in the shadows, darting behind one furniture to another.

For the past few days, I'd felt increasingly unnerved. Coming home from classes, I would sometimes overhear my neighbors talking about their issues with the building. I wasn't particularly fond of taking the elevator with others—it always felt awkward—but it was one of those unavoidable aspects of apartment living.

One afternoon, I found myself sharing the elevator with Mrs. Callahan and a friend she'd brought over, and they were chatting about work. I wasn't one to eavesdrop, but when people are only three or four feet away enclosed in a metallic box with you, it's hard not to catch bits of their conversation.

With my phone out, pretending to be disinterested, I couldn't help but overhear Mrs. Callahan discussing the issues she'd been having with her apartment. She mentioned a gas leak she experienced last week—luckily, it was fixed, but the thought alone was unsettling. I'd heard of a fire in this very building years ago, also caused by a gas leak. It had been ruled an accident, but still, tragedy can linger in people's minds, longer than they hope it would.

I never learned many of the details, not even where in the building it had happened, but I reassured myself that maintenance now was different from before—hoping, for the better.

As I stepped out of the elevator and made my way to my apartment, I noticed Mr. Jobert down the hall, on the opposite side from where I lived. He was a retired veteran from the military, a Coast Guard, as I recall. He was older, with salt-and-pepper hair and a gruff exterior that spoke of age, yet his solid build hinted at strength that could still take on someone younger. Despite the years , he looked like he could outmatch a high school football player if it came to it. Mr. Jobert was the only neighbor I regularly spoke with on this floor.

On my first day, he'd helped me move furniture into my apartment, most likely out of pity when he saw me struggling to get a couch through the doorway. Occasionally, I'd catch a glimpse of his daughter, Cindy. She looked about my age, though I was pretty sure she didn't attend the same university as me—given that I've yet to seen her around campus.

I greeted Mr. Jobert with a quick nod, and he responded with a curt smile as I headed toward my apartment door. My gaze drifted to my unit, and suddenly the door beside mine came into view, triggering memories of last night. The light from the kitchen window flashed back in my mind. As far as I knew, no one lived in the apartment next to mine, that thought replayed in my head like a broken record since last night. With my key poised to turn in the lock, I hesitated, then turned away, striding down the hallway to the other end.

*""Hey, Mr. Jobert, sorry to bother. Are you busy?""* I asked, my keys finding its way back to my pocket.

*""Hey, Josh. No, not at all, just waiting on a delivery,""* he shrugged, tapping away on his phone, one hand holding it upright while the other did heavily tapped on the screen. Something I noticed older people did more often than those younger.

*""I was wondering if I could ask you something.""*

He hummed in acknowledgment, still focused on his device.

*""Do you happen to know if anyone's living in the apartment next to mine?""*

*""506?""* He finally glanced up from his phone, his brow furrowed in a perplexed expression as I nodded.

*""No, son, no one's lived there in years. But, you should know that, right?""*

I scratched my brow, unsure how to explain last night's strange occurrence without sounding like I'd lost it, the thought of talking about these occurrences going on in my apartment to anyone was silly, thinking of me rambling about footsteps, random blotches of dirt and murmured whispers sounded stupid to me, it just made me sound as if I was crazy.

*""Well... last night, when I got up, I saw light coming from my kitchen window. It looked like it was coming from the window in front of mine... from Apartment 506.""*

He stopped tapping on his phone, furrowing his brow further. His expression shifted from confusion to deep thought. As I looked up at him from a shorter angle, I catching a glimpse of the scar on his neck, standing out under the hallway light.

. . .

I remembered the time I'd asked him about that scar, he had me babysit his dog 'Lady' while he was from home for a few days, when he came to pick her up I invited him for coffee, and we had small talk while his white fluff ball of a dog ran around. He wore the same thoughtful expression when I asked, clearly weighing what to say, likely recalling the events that led to him getting the scar. After a moment, once he had gathered his thoughts, he shared a story from his time at sea in the late eighties when he served as a Coast Guard officer.

He talked about his duties back then, the long nights on watch, the unpredictable nature of life at sea, what lurked within the unknown, the unexplored, where nature had made the decision that no man was destined to see. With a slight pause, he finally spoke the day he got his scar. A commercial fishing boat had radioed in for help to the Coast Guard ship he was stationed it at the time.

He and his crew, along with his partner Murphy—who he always referred to by last name—were dispatched to check it out. When their ship neared the boat in distress, he and Murphy deployed into the water to investigate. But something was off. Despite being within close proximity to the boat, they heard no response from the crew, the moment they arrived for help.

Murphy hopped on the boat first, calling out for the fishermen to show themselves. When they got on the vessel was eerily silent, no signs of life anywhere, not even a single sound, say for the haunting winds accompanied by the rain, with the sway of the sea, just no short of distance below them.

With all the lights extinguished, the ship had looked as if abandoned, Murphy joked that maybe a ghost had radioed in, Mr. Jobert didn't really find that funny as he smacked his partner at the back of the head, before the pair proceeded, solely relying on their tactical flashlights. While Murphy entered the wheelhouse, Mr. Jobert stayed by the deck, sweeping his light over the area as they both covered ground.

A full minute hadn't even gone by before a curdling scream pierced through the raining ambience. The scream came from inside the wheelhouse, muffled as the scream was barely contained inside the small shed. Mr. Jobert's heart raced as he rushed to check on his partner. He needed not to check inside the wheel house as the door opened on its own, with Murphy's body had collapsed against it, causing it to come wide open. Mr. Jobert's flashlight beam fell on his partner's form, and what he saw made his stomach drop.

Murphy's chest was filleted open, the bones from his chest ripped out as flesh and blood protruding from deep, claw-like gashes. His face was frozen in an expression of horror, his eyes wide and unblinking as they locked onto Mr. Jobert's. With a trembling hand, Murphy clutched his bleeding throat in an effort to stop the bleeding spilling from his open throat, choking on his own blood. His eyes seemed to scream a silent warning, pleading for Mr. Jobert to run, yet no words escaped his lips—only a sickening gurgle before life drained from his body.

Mr. Jobert frozen, standing in nothing but the shock of his partner's death gripping him, in his eyes at that moment, everything unfolded in a blur. The man he's spent countless of hours to years with as friends and companions was dead right in front of his eyes. Murphy promised him he'd be there for his wedding, he'd be there to see him and Lanie get married.

He was barely holding himself together, let alone fully in comprehension of his situation, when in an instant his flashlight illuminated the open door, something lunged at him with a speed void of any humanlike attributes. He barely got a good look at whoever or whatever it was, before the force had knocked him off balance, causing him to tumble backward at the railing of the ship, his flashlight slipping from his grasp and clattering uselessly as he fell over the side of the boat, plunging into the cold open sea.

Disoriented, he struggled to make sense of what had just happened. He began to realize he was under water as his lungs burned for air, while he instinctively kicked towards the surface, but then a chilling realization hit him—whatever had attacked him, had fallen into the water too.

Fighting against panic, he swam desperately to break through to the surface. The storm above raged violently, with rain and crashing waves making it near impossible to see. His only thought was to get back onto the smaller boat, to escape and reach the safety of the Coast Guard ship. But just as his fingers barely grazed the surface, a cold, scaly grip clamped onto his ankle, the hard piercing scales scratched onto his skin.

In an instant, he was yanked back down into the depths.

Mr. Jobert fought desperately, thrashing against the force pulling him deeper into the dark abyss. With his vision rendered a blur by the water and the panic rising from his chest, he twisted himself around, getting a good look at what had attacked him and his partner—the creature responsible for Murphy's death. Through the red haze of anger and rage he felt in that moment, crippling fear had latched itself onto him as he bared a sight he would never forget, its terrifying form etched itself into his mind, haunting him to this day.

It wasn't human, hell it wasn't even an animal, what Mr. Jobert saw that faithful night was an unearthly aquatic humanoid. Its body was covered in slick, glistening scales, and its limbs were webbed like a grotesque merging of man and sea. Fins protruded from its spine starting from the back of its head down to its tailbone, what locked onto Mr. Jobert was its glowing red eyes bore fully of carnal rage and hunger with an otherworldly intensity.

The creature was either completely feral, or pure evil. Its gaze cutting through the water, locking onto him. After a moment of thrashing in silence, the creature let out a deafening cry—a sound unlike anything he'd ever heard throughout what his time at sea. It started as a deep, haunting whale-like call that had morphed into a glass shattering shriek that rattled his skull, if it weren't for the fact that they were underwater, the piercing echo would've ruptured his eardrums.

Mr. Jobert seen what that thing had done to Murphy, he wasn't going to allow it to do the same thing to him next, for his survival, for his fiance, and for his partner Murphy. He was going to survive, even with nothing but the skin of his teeth, and the fire under his ass. Summoning the strength he could gather, Mr. Jobert lifted his free ankle and used his hard boot to kick the creature square in the face, feeling the satisfying crunch boot against its tough, scaled skin.

The grip on his ankle loosened as its claws started to spread apart from the tight hold, he wasted no time, kicking himself free once more. His lungs burned for air as he swam to get to the surface, until he caught sight of the dark silhouette of the small boat nearby—the small rescue boat he and Murphy used to reach the ill-fated fishing vessel.

Driven by pure survival instinct, he surged upwards, the muffled rain louder as he approached the surface closer. With his heart pounding in his chest and his lungs feeling as if it was going to burst inside his chest, Mr. Jobert aimed for the surface, kicking with all his might.

With the sliver of hope wrapped around him, he felt a sharp grip coil around his shoulders—rough, scaly arms digging into his skin as the creature latched onto him to pull him back down deeper into the depths of the sea. Its cold body pressing against his back, dragging him down like a relentless predator. Panic surged through him, and his muffled scream was lost in the bubbles of water as he nudged and elbowed, struggling to unlatch the thing attaching itself onto him.

In abject fury, Mr. Jobert felt as if he was close to his wits end, feeling his resolve slowly deplete, his fists pounding against the creature's grasp as it clung to him like a drowning parasite, desperate for its host. Its claws latched onto his neck, drawing minimal blood from the piercing grip. This thing was relentless, but Mr. Jobert wasn't going down, not without a fight.

Desperate, from his thrashing and wiggling free from its grasp, he had managed to have enough space to turn his body around, the moment they faced each other, he plunged his thumbs into the creature's eye sockets. His fingers pierced into the creature's presumed weak spot, feeling the cold wet tissues wrapping around his harsh thumbs, whilst deep in its sockets, with his nails pressed against the corneas.

The monster let out a blood-curdling shriek, so piercing it reverberated through the water. Dark blood clouded the surrounding waters around them, turning the sea into a murky red haze. In its pain, the creature retaliated, despite it's blocked vision, it was still able to do some damage, slashing at the side of Mr. Jobert's neck with its claws, ripping the tender flesh, luckily not enough to sever an artery. The attack sent a sharp sting of pain through him. He let out a pained cry, out of agony but didn't stop—he couldn't afford to.

Pulling back his thumbs free, he gave one last kick, channeling all his strength to condemning the creature back to the hell it crawled out of, he used to momentum of the kick to propel himself further up the surface. The cut on his neck throbbing and leaking blood but, still he managed to power through with pure adrenaline. The surface was near, but he dared not look back, focusing on every stroke and kick, driven by sheer power and the will to live.

Mr. Jobert safely returned to the coast guard ship, though he was bloodied and shaken, the slash on his neck was a glaring reminder of the near death experience he'd just survived. His fellow officers swarmed him with questions, what happened to the boat? where was Murphy? Hesitant he'd sound absolutely nuts, he still told his truth. As unbelievable as it sounded, he detailed everything, down to the gash on his neck. He was sure they'd think he was crazy, and that no one would buy the story of an aquatic creature attacking them in the dead of night. But that didn't matter—he knew what he saw, what he encountered, and even if hell decided to open up underneath, he will continue to stand by his account.

A team of coast guard officers later went back to the fishing vessel to investigate, only to find the obvious, nothing. No Murphy. No traces of the creature or its existence, and certainly not a single fisherman that supposedly radioed them in. The only blaring evidence of something gone horribly wrong in the boat was the trail of blood that led from the wheelhouse and vanished into the dark water. Of course, when they returned to shore, an official investigation with law enforcement involved was launched. But it led nowhere, as there were no solid leads, no body to recover, no witnesses beyond Mr. Jobert, who's presumed to be a nut job, though medical and psychological tests proves otherwise, they have no evidence to corroborate his terrifying account.

Murphy was officially listed as ""missing, presumed dead,"" and despite his death, no one could link it to Mr. Jobert or to anything natural. The story was filed away as an unsolved mystery. But even if the rest of the world had to move on, Mr. Jobert never did. He believed—no, *he knew*—what had happened that night. Whether anyone believed him or not didn't matter. That was his truth. And every time he glanced at the scar on his neck, he was reminded of the horror beneath the waves that had claimed his friend and nearly taken his life too.

. . .

*""That does sound strange... Look, it may be unlikely, but it could've also been Grant. Seems far-fetched he'd be doing checks or repairs at that hour, but still.""*

Mr. Jobert's voice cut through the haze in my mind, forcing me to shake off the thoughts that had been swirling around. I tried to focus on what he was telling me.

*""I thought the same,""* I admitted. *""Mr. Grant's been pretty tied up lately with all the repairs around the building. He hasn't even gotten around to fixing my A/C.""*

Mr. Jobert nodded knowingly. *""Yeah, slow repairs aren't exactly uncommon here. You've been here long enough to know. Even if they're swamped with work, they're always slow to respond.""*

I found myself agreeing, thinking over his words, but before I could form a proper response, the elevator behind us dinged. A man in a delivery uniform stepped out, briefly scanning the hallway until his eyes landed on us. He jogged over, pizza box in hand, confirming the order with Mr. Jobert, as I stepped aside letting them handle the exchange.

*""Hey, kid,""* Mr. Jobert said after paying for the pizza, *""fancy coming in for a slice? I decided to just order in for supper. Cindy said she couldn't make it today, busy with whatever school stuff she's got going on.""*

*""Sure.""* I nodded with a chuckled grin.

I wouldn't turn down free pizza, even if someone held a gun to my head. When the delivery guy left through the building elevator, I followed Mr. Jobert inside his apartment. It felt cozy, distinct and as homey as I remembered it would be since the last time I've been. I didn't feel the strange unease that had plagued over me in my own place lately. Here, I could relax and breathe easily, even if it was only for a little while.

Days had passed since my talk with Mr. Jobert, still no sign of Mr. Grant. He didn't come to my apartment to check on anything, none of the complaints I had seemed to have even reached him as I was left on delivered. I really wasn't a stickler to get these issues resolved quickly, if it wasn't for the mold on my A/C that had worsened to the point of it being unbearable to be around. It was spreading out, thick and dark clumps of mold attached itself to the ventilation grills, and the smell... It resembled something rotting, putrid enough to turn my stomach. Eating in the living room had become impossible. I spent most of my time holed up in my room just to escape the stench.

What really pushed me over the edge was when one morning I woke, I found drops of liquid leaking from the vents again, when I heard the familiar sound of liquid tapping on the floor. Only this time, it wasn't water. The blackened mold had begun seeping out between the grills in ink-like streaks, as if an octopus erupted from inside the ventilation system. Since I've been asleep when the leaking had begun, I wasn't able to catch it in time before it made an even bigger mess to clean up. This was a nightmare—scrubbing and mopping for what felt like hours as my arms started to feel restless, doing whatever it could just to get rid of the foul-smelling mess.

Frustrated, and feeling like I'd reached my limit, I finally picked up the phone and called the maintenance guy.

He didn't pick up, and with two hours left before class, I had enough time to pester him until he answered. Frustrated, I spammed his phone with missed calls, feeling like an obsessive ex, when finally, just as I was rifling through the fridge for something to pack for lunch, a crackling sound echoed from my phone's speakers. My attention snapped back to it, sitting on the counter, and I rushed over to pick it up.

*""What?""*

His voice was groggy, and I could tell he'd just woken up, which only irritated me more. The nerve—like I was the one being a bother, as if I committed a the great sin of coming to him about the repairs he should've done two weeks ago.

*""Mr. Grant, I texted you weeks ago about my A/C. It's molding at this point! I've had to clean up this disgusting mess—""*

*""Ah, shit. I'm sorry, kid,""* he interrupted, sounding more exhausted than anything. ""Yeah, I got your texts... and all the other complaints from everyone else in the building. I haven't gotten to your problem yet because it's not as urgent as some of the other crap I'm dealing with.""

His voice grew more aggravated, as if he was recalling everything at once.

*""Yesterday, that fat bitch Bertha from 304 had people raising alarms because her apartment started smelling like a goddamn corpse. I had to call 911, and we busted down her door thinking she'd dropped dead from a heart attack. Turns out she's been hoarding dead cats, and the smell was seeping through the walls. So, excuse me if I haven't gotten around to your A/C since the beginning of the month.""*

I couldn't really mutter up much of a response, he could tell I was taken aback by his ranting as he sighed, seemingly out of pity for leaving me speechless at the other line.

*""Okay... how about this,"" he offered, sounding a little less annoyed, ""I'll come check it out next week on Monday. Can you stick it out until then?""*

*""Yes, please,""* I muttered.

*""Great.""* He hung up.

Sighing, I just shrugged it off, returning to what I'd been doing at that time, before the call interrupted me. My college classes that day was as mundane as ever, with the usual routine dragging on, although it was a bit more stressful, as holidays were approaching, deadlines had to be met. With another semester being nearly over—only a more week until the sweet temporarily release from school, due to the winter break. I could practically feel the collective excitement around the campus—students, staff, and even professors were looking forward to the break for a chance to head home to their families for the holidays.

Though, it was still Thursday after all, and I had a few more classes to power through before the Monday break finally arrived, so I couldn't feel too comfortable just yet.

I was burning the midnight oil, working on papers that were due the next day, when the familiar pang of hunger hit. Leaning back in my chair, I let out a sigh and glanced at the monitor. My eyes skimmed the pages of the essay I'd been hammering out for hours. The bulk of it was done, thankfully, but it still needed a final round of revisions and a few touch-ups before I could submit it to my professor.

My eyes drifted to the bottom right corner of the screen: 11:44. Sixteen minutes before the deadline. I quickly double-checked for any glaring errors—grammar, spelling, all the usual pitfalls that professors would chew you on for, if overseen. Satisfied that it was as polished as it was going to get, I let out a deep sigh. It was time. I drafted an email, attached the file, and hit ""Send."" The weight of that assignment was finally lifted off my shoulders, as I felt a sigh of relief come out of me.

The calming pitter-patter of rain against my bedroom window had lulled me into a rare state of peace. With my essay finally behind me, I leaned back into my chair, letting the white noise wash over me. For the first time in a while, my mind felt clear—until a sudden, muffled crash jolted me alert. The distinct clatter of ceramic hitting the floor sent a jolt of unease through me. My eyes shot to the bedroom door, dimly lit by the glow of my desk lamp.

Slowly, I stood, my heart picking up speed as I moved toward the noise.

The creak of my door echoed softly as I stepped out into the hallway, the warm light barely guiding my steps. I made my way to the kitchen, each footfall muted by the quiet of the apartment. My fingertips brushed against the cold plastic of the switch before I flicked it on, and the harsh kitchen light buzzed to life, casting long shadows across the floor.

There I found before me pieces of a plate I had used previously earlier in the day, what was once a formed ceramic piece was now reduced to jagged pieces of shattered glass onto the floor. With my brows furrowed I began to clean, I assumed it had slipped somehow from the counter. I had just washed these letting them out to dry on the drain board before I could put it back on the cabinet above the counter, where I stored my other plates.

Sweeping the shards into a neat pile, my eyes drifted to the counter where the plate would have been. Something about it felt off. The surface was smeared with grime—dust and debris mingled with smudges of what looked to be mud. But what stopped me cold was a medium-sized mark, unmistakably resembling a footprint. I froze, staring at it for a moment longer than necessary. After discarding the broken pieces, I turned my attention to scrubbing the dirt from the counter, the unsettling image of that footprint lingering at the back of my mind.

Quite frankly, I would've been more freaked out, if this wasn't the first time I'd come across something like this. Just the week before, after coming home late from a dinner with some groupmates after class, I'd noticed dirt trailing from the front door to the living room. At the time, I shrugged it off, assuming it was my own doing, maybe from rushing in and out? But now, with the footprint shaped mark on a counter, I was sure I hadn't caused, it boggled my mind.

I knew for certain that this time it wasn't me. And I had no idea what to make of it.

On my way back to my room, no longer feeling the need to eat, that eerie sensation returned—the same one I had felt the night I hesitantly stepped out of my bedroom, the same night the kitchen window had glared with the unnatural light from the mirroring window next door. Only this time, there was nothing. No light, no unexplained footsteps that I tried to pass off as dripping water. Just silence.

I stood frozen for what felt like five long minutes, staring into the dim, hollow space of my living room. The shadows twisted unnervingly, and the outlines of my furniture felt uncanny, as if the empty leather seats were watching me, accusing me of being an intruder in my own home. A chill gripped me, creeping up my spine, as I saw it, a dark hand emerging from behind the couch, gripping the seat to help itself up further, slowly rising as the smell of rotting emitted from the ventilation above became more prominent.

My chest tightened, and before I knew it, my eyes stung with tears I hadn't realized were forming.

The tension snapped, and I bolted to my room, slamming the door behind me, causing the crucifix attached above the doorway to shake, as I flicked the lock with shaking hands. With my back pressed against the door, sinking myself to the floor, the gentle, warm glow from my desk lamp was my only comfort, casting a soft light in the room that barely reached the corners.

I sat with my knees pulled to my chest, hugging myself tightly like a child seeking shelter.

My forehead rested against my knees, and for a brief moment, I let my body curl in on itself, trying to find peace in that fetal position, hoping to feel safe again. With stray tears trickling slowly down the skin of my cheek, I heard the faint sound of a music box, its soft, lilting notes permeated my ears, hearing the source coming from under the slit of the door, slowly lulling me to sleep.

1hcknq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/APlusWriting_/comments/1hcknq2/10_study_hacks_for_every_student/,10 Study Hacks for Every Student,"# Review content every day

At the end of the day, take an hour or 30 minutes to review the content you learned. Don’t wait until the days leading up to an exam to cram information. Set aside time to look over your notes and re-read material. As you review, take into consideration the content you had a difficult time understanding. Make this a priority in your daily study time to ensure you understand it leading up to the exam. 

# Ask questions when you don’t understand

As you review content, seek help and clarification when you don’t understand a concept. Utilize your faculty and their office hours to ask them your questions. Seek help from other peers as well. Collaborating with others can also help lead to understanding. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!

# Know your learning style

Knowing your learning style will help you get the most out of your studying. Capitalize on this so you can retain information. Do you learn better with flashcards or do you prefer to listen to audio from lectures? If you are a verbal learner, reviewing content with a group might be the best option for you. Look for ways that meet your learning needs. 

# Block out your calendar

Treat studying like a job. Block out time in your schedule that is dedicated to studying. Avoid planning activities with friends or family so you can focus on knowing your content. As exam day draws near, you will need extra time in your schedule to study. Be sure to plan accordingly so you can devote adequate time to understanding content. 

# Stay organized and ahead of the game

Look at your syllabus and write down all of your exams and assignments. Put this in your calendar because this will help you prepare and plan out when you need to study. Deadlines approach quickly, so manage your time well and give yourself enough time to study content and complete assignments without stress before test day. 

# Find a study space

Create a space in your home where you can focus and concentrate well. This space will need a comfortable place to sit with good lighting. We recommend having a desk so you can have a place to spread out your books, assignments, notes and computer. Consider changing up your study space every once in a while. Maybe visit a coffee shop or outdoor location for a change in scenery during your study time.  

# Be undistracted

There are many distractions all around you that can prevent you from getting the most out of your study time. We recommend turning your phone on “do not disturb” and placing it outside of the room so you are not tempted to reach for it. Stay focused on the task at hand and check your phone periodically. If you live with others, they can also be a distraction. Find a quiet place to study and let them know that you are unavailable for a few hours so hopefully you can study without interruptions. 

# Take breaks

No one likes staying stationary for hours on end. Taking breaks while studying can increase your productivity and help you reset so you can retain information. After a few hours, take a 5 to 30 minute break to reset and refocus. Consider going for a walk, stretching, eating a snack, running an errand or watching an episode of your favorite TV show to help you relax. 

# Fuel your brain

While studying, avoid eating processed foods like chips, cookies and sweets. Instead, choose snacks that are whole foods like fruit, nuts, cheese sticks or dark chocolate if you are needing something sweet.

# Find a good study group

As you prepare for exams, finding a good study group is another way to get the most out of your study time. Reviewing content with others allows you to test your knowledge, ask questions and solidify your understanding. Make sure these groups are productive, try to refrain from discussing matters outside of the content you are reviewing. Did you know Baptist Health College Little Rock has study rooms on campus? You can reserve a room for group study sessions through the Business Office. ",1,1734008693.0,APlusWriting_,0,1.0,False

The wagons or tanks rolled through the gate in a caravan that was more akin to a carnival than a group of tradesmen; all the wizards with their pointed hats were shaped magnificently against the browns and grays, some wore white porcelain dramedy masks beneath headwear as dark as pipe resin, men and women and those between—as that was common from where they hailed. Their company was perhaps forty and their mules and mares were thirsty and were led to troughs to idle while the wizards removed goods from their wagons or tanks and although it was not a spectacle for them to arrive within Golgotha’s walls, it was something still and the citizens gathered to greet whatever wizards they might know but mostly perhaps to whisper rumors on them. The wizards seemed a taller folk, but that was because of the hats, and they seemed wider too, but that was for the robes they adorned with costume jewelry, trinkets, or fingernail-sized lanterns which contained magical properties hung off their clothes as ornaments (some metal and other crudely wooden). I never knew a people that could trek the wastes in that time as well as me till I knew them.

Boss Maron was there at the gates with his wall men, hollering—shouting really, “The Whores of Babylon have come again!” And the bells signaled from atop the highest tower over the hall of Bosses and I met the front square with a morning headache and a cigarette. The Boss sheriff was clothed, cowboy hat pulled tightly to his ears, and he waltzed through the square, inspecting the new arrivals with his crotch out in front of him as he moved in a swagger like a cup of shifted water. Morning sunlight crested the wall to reflect on the pistol in his holster as it did on the star pin of his hat.

Among them, there was only one wizard I cared to see. Their name was Suzanne.

The hanged bodies of the men remained on the wall, dead and stiff and shifting to the little wind there was.

The square had filled with carts (some drawn by animals and others pushed on oil), and even if it were not for the bells which signaled their arrival, I’d have surely known their presence for the clatter of their metal engines.

“Well goddamn!” said Maron while examining a wizard, “What’s that you’ve got on your legs?”

The wizard, a young woman in plain pants wore a set of leg braces and whenever she moved, she did so in shifting her hips around. “Braces,” she said.

“What’s it for? Or is it some of your all’s secret whodo?”

“I’ve got bad legs. The braces help.” She said plainly, attempting to angle herself straight like a stick against one of the traveling party’s wagons.

“Bad legs?” Boss Maron’s expression was incredulous. “Who has bad legs? What sort of nonsense is it? If a lady like you’s made it this far in life with bad legs, then someone’s done you a disservice.”

She looked on questioningly while the other wizards continued with their unpacking or their conversating—whether it be amongst themselves or with the freckle-spaced citizens in the square.

“How are you to outrun trouble when you’ve got them?” He nodded at the young woman’s legs.

“I don’t.” Her face was red either because of the sun or because of the scrutiny. “I’m just bow-legged.”

“Damn,” he shook his head, “Well how much you want for one of them?”

“One of my braces?”

“Yeah. All I want’s the one anyway.”

“I need both of them.”

“C’mon. You wouldn’t notice just one missing. I mean, you’ve got a spare right next to it.”

Upon noticing a robed figure I recognized by the animals at the troughs, I moved to them instead and let Maron’s conversation fall to the wayside. The chatter of the crowd was wild and startled words came as a wizard exposed their collection of tonics to passersby.

“Suzanne,” I said.

The figure turned to face me, moving their head to look away from a mare they’d been brushing to expose one of those white porcelain masks.

I knew it and could not contain a smile.

“Harlan?” asked the figure. The mask on its face was split in the middle with hinges on either side and they opened it to show their face; it was Suzanne. They’d grown some hair around their throat and wore lipstick on their lips and dyes on their eyes.

“It’s good to see you.” I pushed myself into a hug with them and I could smell the travel off them but didn’t care.

They shifted timidly before hugging me back and I pretended not to notice. Once we’d separated, I looked on Suzanne’s face again and they were looking on at the hanging men on the wall. “Again?” they asked.

I nodded and shot a look towards the Boss across the way.

“What justice?” they asked no one while shaking their head.

Trying an answer, I said, “Justice is something man made, I think. I’ll leave men to men and the rest to God.”

“God.” Suzanne nodded glumly then shook their head. “Which one?”

I laughed a good laugh that felt real but nervous too then kicked the ground and took the last drag off my cigarette before chucking it to the ground. “What’s brought you here?”

Suzanne answered plainly. “We took a long time east out near Pittsburgh.” Their eyes scanned the buildings further on from the square. “The people there are worse than here, it seems. At least you still have your walls.”

“Pittsburgh’s fallen?”

They frowned. “Not completely. They’ve mostly gone underground. A skitterbug infestation caused a plague directly before an attack of proportions I’ve yet seen.” Suzanne’s brow furrowed. “It was awful.” The words hung in the air for a moment. “But we’re here now and thought we’d stop for a rest and some guns and ammo before returning to Babylon. We’ve brought some medicines to trade.”

I learned from my friend that Pittsburgh’s infrastructure and fortifications were decimated in an attack the wizards only caught second-hand and the survivors—holed away in the tunnels beneath Pittsburgh—told of how the demons ran the walls once their reserves were low.

Then the wizards gathered there began unpacking books, some scrolls, and there were medicines too and some of the Bosses other than Maron (he pushed his harassment of the young wizard with leg braces) graced us there with their presence as they came on and began to pick across the goods, haggling prices. Boss Frank was there, and he stood before a wizard by a tank with a wooden table of jars—capped elixirs of varying colors—he grew increasingly frustrated with their selection and took on in his braggadocious way, speaking of numbers. A few of the idle wizards leaned against carts or even took across town and a small group of them had gathered for a quick show near the guard posts, playing instruments (strings over the vocals of “In My Life”) and there in the front of them was a young wizard man that had removed his hat to show how he played with fire flames off his hands—it was a sideshow play—and the citizens wore variations of bemusement or disgust. The children of Golgotha, all dirty faced with sprigs of hair jutting about from their morning’s waking, seemed totally bewildered in the joy of song and clapped their hands or shook their hips all with smiles.

I stuffed my hands in my jacket and prodded Suzanne, “What’s with the plague? I mean, was it contained? None of your lot got sick, did they?”

Suzanne scoffed, perhaps a little pridefully, “No. I wouldn’t worry about that.” They patted a nearby mule then withdrew a brush and moved it across its thin coat before looking over its hooves. “I’ve brought you some books I found out that way though. You still read?”

I nodded.

“Don’t expect any of that fiction. The only ones I’ve found recently are old pamphlets or medical texts.” Suzanne paused and smiled, returning the animal brush to their robes, “You haven’t happened upon anything that might interest me, have you?”

Their shown teeth were infectious. “Mayhap. I’d need you to come back to my place so I could give them to you.” An awkward pause followed and the roar of the still accumulating crowd overtook the space between us before I continued. “Mostly interesting containers and a few flecks of gold I took from some old computers—they’ve been waitin’ on you for weeks now. I got some parchment that might be of use to you too. You can take what you need as always.”

“How about we get some food? I’m famished. Riding through the night takes its toll.”

Me and Suzanne took from the square up a narrow route that led through residences where the lower levels had their curtains drawn and then we took stairs toward balconies and catwalks configured from reinforced metal; we spoke as we went and a few odd glances from passersby met the wizard as we did.

“The tide on the east is rising again,” said Suzanne.

“Worse than before?”

“Worse than before.”

“God, I don’t think I’ve seen the ocean for a decade or more.” I slid my hand along the railing once we came to what was essentially my front porch; it was a perch among the catwalks that cut against the domicile where I shared walls with others on three sides and we stopped there outside my door. “We saw a dragon only a few days ago.”

Suzanne’s interest seemed piqued. “A dragon? And what direction was it traveling?”

“Well,” I craned over the railing, looking down the narrow walkway that separated my building and the one across the way; I couldn’t see the front square from outside my home, but I could still just make out the music echoing from that direction, “Could’ve been north or west. I was preoccupied, but I wouldn’t worry much. The wall men gave it a pretty good thrashing before it took off.”

“Hmm.”

“So, the ocean? It’s rising, huh?”

They joined me there on railing, supporting themselves against their forearms. “It is. Faster than ever. Some bad magic’s taken the water. I imagine by the end of the year Pittsburgh will be under it. There’s something bad coming. You might call it intuition if you want, but I know it’s coming. Something bad. Revelations bad. There comes a time when even those of us forsaken are brought worse.”

“Bah!” I couldn’t help it, “John thought it was the end times while he wrote the damn thing. And what about all the other books? Hm?”

Suzanne put up their hands. “I didn’t mean it like that at all. You know I’m only the mildest scholar on the topic.”

“Anyway. You’d better not start having visions. Got enough to worry about as is.” I’d not realized my shoulders were tense until their hand touched me, and I flinched.

“You’ve a bruise around your neck. Care to elaborate there?”

I shook my head. “Got into a fight.”

Suzanne laughed, removed their pointed hat and playfully put it on my head. “C’mon. Cook me something. You might not know a thing about spices, but your cooking’s always tasted better.”

We took through my door to my small single room where simple amenities awaited and an ancient, decommissioned pump-shotgun hung on the wall over the bed. “That’s just ‘cause you ain’t the one laboring over it.”

Across a meal of potato cakes and toasted bread, we drank coffee until I broke into the liquor to spice my coffee and alleviate my hangover, and we shared the drink and Suzanne took to wash in the sink while I smoked outside on the overlook. Upon returning to the room, I saw them there with a wet rag stuffed beneath an armpit and they were beautiful caught without robes, frame cast in sunglow through the crack in my doorway. In a moment, our hands glided around one another in a scramble of arms at the middle point between us and we took to bed for a while.

Come midday, we remained there, staring at the ceiling, chests bare, and blanket strewn across our lower halves.

“You’re going gray,” said Suzanne.

“You’re getting old too, ya’know.”

“Yes.”

“How long did you say you’ll be staying?” I asked while trying to mask whatever excitement may be present.

“Few days. Once we’ve enough ammunition.” They traced their index finger along my ear lobe.

“Stay.” I offered.

They frowned. “Come.”

“I did already.”

They gave me a light shove and cut their eyes at me. Hazel. How good that color was. “Really. What keeps you here?”

“Things.” I pushed up in the bed to sit, finagling my underwear from the jeans on the floor.

“I wish you would.”

“I’m no wizard.”

“You don’t need to be.”

“Maybe there will come a time when I take you up on that offer. Who knows?” I slid into the drawers. 

“Is it Maron?” they asked, “I don’t know your fascination with him. He’s the worst combination cruel and dumb I’ve seen.”

“Like an animal.” I nodded. “Like something real bad’s wrong with him. But no. He’s not my fascination.” Lying was always hard with them. “I worry about this place. I wouldn’t do the things I do if I didn’t. What if I were to leave it and then it turns out like Pittsburgh.”

“Oh, you’re an expert in plagues now?”

“No,” I scoffed, “I guess it’s just a place that weighs on my conscious.” I went to sit on the bed alongside them.

“You hate it here. I can see it more on your face every time we meet.”

“That I do. Call it an investment dilemma. I’ve put time in it, and I want it to be well.”

“That doesn’t sound like you.”

I caught Suzanne’s face there, staring up from the flat pillow, flustered. My reasoning was hard, but I continued, “There is one thing I should undo before I leave here. It’s a long time coming, and I don’t know if I can. But it’s important,” upon seeing their quizzical expression, I added, “And it is secret.”

“I wish you’d come with us. You’d be welcome.”

“I’ll visit Babylon sometime next month. I promise.”

“You shouldn’t call it that. I don’t like it when you call it that.” The wizards never called their home Babylon; that was a name conjured by the many religious fanatics that considered their magic evil (even if they did trade with the ‘heretics’ from time to time). The name they’d given their own city of medicine was Alexandria; it was fitting for I’d seen their expansive libraries and could become lost in them easily.

“Fine. I’ll be there.” I squeezed their hand in mine. “I’ll miss you once you’ve gone.”

“Don’t get sappy,” they said before planting a kiss on my forehead.

The day went and then the next and another and the wizards packed their belongings. No more music for Golgotha, only quiet agony. As Suzanne said, they’d left me a few books and I’d given away my parchment, jars, and gold. While they were in town, I even was able to snag a few more bottles of their famous wizard liquor along with a few vials of medicine—always good to have whenever I set foot beyond the walls or when someone within might need it.

There came a time finally—as every time it does—where I watched the caravan, with gray smoke clouds off the engines, take on north first where there was an opening wide enough in the ruins to accommodate vehicles, then it hooked around a wide bend that took them west then their black shapes against the red morning skyline disappeared like fading ink as their magic cloaked them entirely. I wished them well, but at the moment of dissipation, I felt an urge to leap from the top of the wall, charge across the field, scream that I was coming and scream it loud enough that I’d hurt myself. I think I just loved—though I never said it aloud and neither did they—and love is a bad thing more often than it is good, for the longing it leaves in its absence drives a person mad and I did not want to be mad; the feeling burst from me quietly there on the wall while I was flanked on either side by guards. I was sure all along the way they went that I could just make out Suzanne among them; that was probably a fault in my vision, but I imagined they were casting glances back, hoping to hold me as strongly as I wished to hold them. I went to the streets of Golgotha where the town quieted from the previous days’ engagements with the wizards.

Normal came and settled and then came chanting from Lady as she moved through sullen quiet streets. She was so far off that I was not sure it was her at all and then came the lines as she drew nearer by the hydroponics towers, and she shouted them vigorously and shook her fist above the air and held a staff with a swinging lantern of incense in her opposite hand, partly for ceremony and partly for support. The words came harshly, gravelly:

“They called to the mountains and to the rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”

“The lamb will be your shepherd. He will guide you. Hallelujah! He will lead you to the springs of living water and wipe away every tear!”

“Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand! Do not be tempted by the deviousness of the whorish Babylonians for all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”

A person, among the catwalks, shouted down at Lady, “Shut-the-fuck-up!”

I watched her come fully down the avenue as she dodged a thrown egg from somewhere unseen, then dashed away toward an offshoot alley to hide somewhere, incense lantern smoking, clanging against her back while she screeched off more scripture from memory. After she was long gone, I moved to the spot where the egg was, rubbed it into dirt with the sole of my boot and looked up through the spiderweb network of catwalks overhead; there was no one.

Without a thing keeping me, I took off the following day, and upon meeting the gates, Maron was there and I could see he was the proud owner of a used leg brace; he grinned upon seeing me, patting his mustache down with his forefinger and thumb.

“Whatcha’ think?” He motioned to his left leg. “It’s a bit of a conversation starter, ain’t it?”

“Get your boys to open the gate, I’m going out.”

He shook his head. “Won’t find anything out there. It’s all dirt and rubble, you know.”

“Just open it.”

“You know what?” He cut his eyes at me. “There’s gonna’ come a day when you won’t be so able bodied or maybe the Bosses won’t like you coming and going as you please.”

I inhaled heavily then let it go. “Now can’t we skip to the end where you acquiesce to my request?”

“Words words words you’ve got. You’ve got a lot of words. Acquiesce. Psshaw.” Boss Maron waved for the guards to open the gate and they did, and I stepped by him, and he spit somewhere behind me before I heard him hobble around with his single leg brace.

The path was clear and open on all sides and in no time, I’d taken across the field to the east and found myself on the edge of the ruins where things stank, and I was free from no other thought than to live. Creeping hot overcame me and brought my hair to my forehead and I holed off in a shadow to drank from my gourd before continuing. The sun was red in the sky in the places where I could see sky from around the black shadows of towering structures. I ducked beneath an old shop counter when I heard the skittering of fart heads and pulled a sleeve to kill the scent of their chlorine breath.

Once they’d gone, I pulled through the wreckage more and more till I came upon the markings for an old safehouse in the back office of a garage I’d not been to in a while. What were my intentions? Was I going to go all the way to the coast? Throw myself into those bad magic waters? There’s a thing they don’t teach you in religion. They prattle all day to do this or that and they say that Hell awaits sinners or Hades or maybe its in layers or circles or what have you. They’ll tell you about the places and they’ll say that if you take life into your own hands, you end in Hell, but what’s a person to do when those creeping intrusions come along—the ones that call to a person in the darkness, the ones where they tempt you to jump from a high place or there’s always a gun or a poison. Maybe a person could bribe another to do it for them. Where do they end up then? What are you supposed to do to stave off those thoughts? Should a person contend such melancholies with prayer? That did not seem helpful. What is the soulless to do without the promise of those pearly gates anyway?

Anyway, I took on past the safehouse and found a utility hall in the side of a tall industrial building just beyond a partially erect chain link fence. The wall was opened up like a cracked shell from years of standing alone, and after ducking through there, I found some old matches in a drawer, plastic gas cans whose contents had long since congealed within; I kicked them (not that I expected anything more). Moving further down the wide hallway, there were shelves of dusty tools, and I took some hammers and knives (cheapo stuff).

Further still down the hall, there was a staircase, and I took it quietly; the stone stairs made hardly a sound against the bottoms of my boots, and I took the stairs more quickly till I was out of breath and caught myself on a landing where I supped silent air before rushing further up the stairs. An old metallic cabinet or console—I couldn’t make it out—lay strewn across the steps to the second-highest floor and I climbed over it before coming to the building’s roof access. Upon coming to the door with a metal push bar across its middle, I gave it a shove and it did not budge but a minor clink and I took a moment to collect myself before rummaging through my gear.

Slung through a loop on the inside of my pack was a short prybar that was so worn around its tooth it was more rounded than an edge; I shimmied the piece of metal into the spot where the door latched into the way and began crimping the spot apart, trying all the while to maintain a relative quiet in the dead ruins. Once I’d bent away at the door for a few moments, I elevated my body weight at an awkward angle to pop the door free and it did so, half open, with a rusty screech that forced a long pause from me; I stood there by the newly opened doorway for a full minute, holding the prybar, holding my breath. Upon hearing nothing in response to the noise of the door, I slid the tool into my pack and slipped through the threshold.

The flat roof of the industrial building sloped to one corner—where the opening in the wall of the first floor was—and sitting there in the middle of an open platform was an old helicopter, blades half torn away or rusted off and the remaining slanted from the top of the old vehicle, touching the platform it sat upon. The roof access looked like a little square house atop the flat headed structure and around the side of the access, I found an old corpse (entirely bones) wrapped in black plastic-like armor, the white dry fingers laid across its lap, several digits gone and its hollow eye holes staring off into the sky with a permanent smile. I moved to the thing that hadn’t been human in a long time and prodded it; the skeleton slumped to the side and looked on the ground by its shoes. How long had it been staring at the sky and how long had it been waiting for me to come and change its dead visage?

I moved to the edge of the building, to the corner where the building sloped and looked off the edge to the ground below; all was quiet, and nothing moved save the shadows’ stalwart creep across the ground. Examining from above, I could see the opening I’d climbed through and beneath my shifting feet, I felt the ground give a little; timidly, I angled more forward and for a moment I thought I knew why I’d gone up there in the first place. Suddenly six-stories felt high. The urge to jump came. Perhaps on the way down, I’d have just a blink to convince myself I’d slipped.

“Hey!” A shout from somewhere down below came from the direction I’d come from. I shook my head as it felt as though it was a ghost echo, a noise that wasn’t. Then it came again, “Hey!”

I squinted my eyes and there in the crumbled road below, there was a human I didn’t initially recognize; it was only after the figure tumbled through the remains of the chain link fence that I recognized it as Dave. I blinked. 

Out of breath, he angled over to the opening at the base of the structure and called up at me, “Hey! I see you up there!”

Whisper-yelling, I cupped my hands, “Shutup!”

I took back to the stairs, and he hollered after, “Where you going?”

With reckless abandon, I took the stairs many at a time, leapt the cabinet on the stairs, scrambling while also reaching for the prybar I’d put away. I held the cold metal in my hand and charged toward the industrial storage hallway where I could see him silhouetted in the frame of the crumbled opening.

His chest heaved and he wiped at his brow; slung across his shoulder was a small supply bag and worn like a necklace was a pair of binoculars. “God, you move fast. Like a fuckin’ cockroach in light.” His eyes shifted from my face to the prybar in my hand as I approached him.

Standing within the echoey hallway, I lifted the weapon and pointed it at him. “What’d you follow me for?”

“You wouldn’t use that on me.” He took his eyes from the prybar. “I don’t think you would anyway. You might be shady, Harlan, but I don’t take you as a stone-cold murderer.”

“You take me wrong,” I said.

“Maybe.” He seemed to think on it a moment. “You wouldn’t?”

“If you’ve given away my position to those things, I might.”

“Lots of bluster.” Dave offered an incredibly forced smile, and I could see just from the little shine of the sun in the opening that his eye had blacked but remained functional. “I been watching you.”

“Oh?”

He nodded. “I snuck out after you.”

“You ought to go back.”

“You ought to just listen. There ain’t a thing back there for me.”

“I don’t care.” The sharpness in my voice felt good. “I don’t need some sorry sack sneaking up on me when I’m mindin’ my own.”

A quiet laugh. “There’s nothing there for me. I been farming all my life and if I die,” he shrugged, “So be it.”

“Idiot. Fuckin’ idiot.”

“You manage out here! Wizards can too!”

“Wizards have magic.”

“You got some of that?”

I lowered the crowbar.

“We’ve got to stop starting our conversations with fights.” He paused and moved into the shadowy hallway of the building before perching in a half-sit half-lean against the wall near me. “I never was violent anyway, so if you want to hit me with that then do it.”

“Hmm.”

His shirt clung to him, sweat thick and dark on his chest and pits. “Goddamn you move fast.”

“You should wear a jacket or something. Long sleeves keep the sun off and a thicker material gives you a modicum of protection.” I took to squatting too, maintaining ample distance betwixt us. “A hat helps too, but I’m always losing hats.” I chewed on my tongue while mulling over whether I should leave him.

“Are you going to try and slink away while I’m not looking?”

I blinked. “No.”

“Liar.” He took a healthy gulp from his water gourd then wiped his mouth. “East is the ocean?”

I nodded.

“Is it far?”

I nodded. “For you.”

Dave sighed. “Thank you.”

“For?”

“Telling me.”

“Okay.”

“You ever have any kids?”

I shook my head.

“It’s somethin’. Henry had so much energy—especially when he was little—there was times I didn’t think he’d ever settle down.”

“What are you doing out here?” I asked.

“Helen told me she was the same way when she was his age. She had energy too. I feel so tired.”

“Dave. What the fuck are you doing out here? Why’d you follow me?”

He took one last swallow from his gourd before shoving it into his pack. “I wanted to talk to you about killin’ the Bosses.”

I laughed into my hand. “That’s—that’s a thought.”

“I mean it.” His stare was like pinpricks.

I’m sitting on a train traveling for work today and can’t even think straight. There literally isn’t enough coffee in the world these days.

Anyways, I am in the US and despite that, was given 5 months of paid maternity leave which was great. I started my daughter in daycare at 4.5 months for half days, 2 weeks before I had to go back to work to help us all with the new schedule/ adjustment. I’ve now been back at work 3 weeks. I kid you not, we have all been ill for 5 weeks straight. First it was the stomach bug, then a 2 week long cold, now it’s developed to an ear and sinus infection.

My husband and I have gotten it all (minus the ear infection) alongside her as well. She is back to being up all night since she doesn’t feel well. While she technically could be back at daycare since she’s on antibiotics, we’re keeping her out to let her fully recover since she seems so weak/ sick still. We also want her better for Christmas since we’ll have a bunch of family in town visiting and don’t want to have to miss out on things with everyone. Therefore, we’re leaning on family and adhoc babysitters to get us through the next week and a half of work. Thank GOD we both wfh and have some family around to help here and there. 

Despite feeling lucky with paid mat leave, wfh, family nearby to help I feel like I’m losing my mind. People at work seem to be somewhat understanding right now, but will they still be this way if this is continuing 6 months from now? Everyone is telling me to buckle up, and that it will probably be the hardest winter of our lives. 

I am at a point where budgeting and saving money is out the window. Please tell me all your recommendations of services to make your life easier. We have a cleaning service that comes once a month but it doesn’t feel like enough. I’ll probably up that to twice a month for now. Meal service recommendations? Dog walking? What am I missing? HELP!

### *""Thinking of it as a function"" is all you need.*
### *LangChain considered harmful*
### *Getting my agents to create agents for fun an profit*

## Introduction

Yes, you read that title correctly. And yes, I'm actually serious about this.

(Though I'll admit the title was partially crafted to capture your attention.)

## What this post will try to demonstrate

- There is such a thing as a *default path* to AGI.
- I propose **Agentic over Next Token Prediction** as the default next step on that path.
- I propose some high level key aspects of this agentic as a likely default. namely:
  - **Tree Of Agents**. 
  - **Agents as code**
- We can't automate everything at once, but if you break down decisional processes and actions, give each agent ONE responsibility and make agents use agents, we probably CAN automate more than you think with current LLMs

## About me

I'm diagnosed as smart (Not to brag, but my IQ has three digits), but also as autistic with severe ADHD and DID. About that last one - I wouldn't take offense if you don't believe it's real. In full transparency, I'm sometimes skeptical myself about most people who claim to have it. The relevant part is: I occasionally lose 6 hours of my life, and code mysteriously appears. While I'm a strong advocate for clean code and TDD, some part of me (let's call him Anakin) doesn't really care. That part does agentic development.


Now, I think my approach to AGI is correct - but then again, thinking you're right is basically what having an opinion means. And as Buddha wisely noted:
> «Opinions are like butt holes, everyone has one, and I have several» 

What I'm saying is that, if you disagree with some of the premises (like, how I define AGI) don't dismiss everything.

To make this extensive technical discussion digestible:
- **Key points will be in bold** for easy skimming
- Each section is clearly titled and self-contained
- You can read sections in any order
- Technical concepts will be explained assuming various levels of expertise

## Why I hope for as outcome of this post (+Where you can find a use my work)

**Goal**: My dream would be to be full time on fiddling with agentic, because I'm somehow good at it, and it procures me joy beyond what words could tell.

I want to share my work, discuss it with people. 

### How you can support me

I'm launching a Patreon as well as Discord server (link in comment), where I'll share **ALL** my work. Past, present and future. I'd also do a few video calls each week to share my advancements, review code, discuss everyone's ideas. And create comprehensive walk-trough tutorials to get you to build awesome agentic ! 



**I won't lie: if you like this post, and decide to share it on Youtube/tXitter/MSN Messenger, that would be greatly appreciated. And I can't overstate how much it would genuinely help me.**

## Core Thesis 

**AGI Definition**: For this discussion, I'm defining AGI specifically as **a competent software engineer**. Here's why:

1. I'm a software engineer. I could automate a lot of jobs if given infinite time (not specifically me—I mean in general, ""a software engineer"" + ""infinite time"" = ""automating a lot of stuff"").
2. **Agents are code** - If agent are made of code. What other path would there be for self improvement ?



**The point I'll try to make**: from where we are now to AGI, I believe there is a default path, and that this path can be reasoned about.

## Technical Foundation

### ""Think of it as a function"" 

A powerful heuristic to think about AI (but also code in general) is to specify something as a function, as in `a Python function` (as opposed to stricter definition, like in `Functional Programming`)

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│     Inputs      ├────►│   black box    │────►│   Outputs   |
└─────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                │                                
                                │         ┌──────────────┐
                                └────────►│ Side Effects │
                                          └──────────────┘
```

The point of that heuristic is that, whenever you want to code something, you can (and should) think separately about:
- The behavior you expect at use time. What it does from an outside perspective (as a function). ie: what outputs and side effects for a given input
- The implementation details (what's inside the black box)


You can do it with anything, even humans (which will be useful later)

**Me, remote Software Engineer `As a function`**: I take inputs (requirements, emails, coffee ☕) and produce outputs (code, messages) with side effects (deploying features, updating repositories)

## The Path to AGI

### Why Next Token Prediction Was Inevitable

Starting with the Turing test (but it extends to ""an entity that writes code""). AGI, whatever it turns out to be, will produce language.

Let's break this down:

1. **Language is Sequential**: What control flow could it be based upon ? Can you describe one other than: *It predicts one chunk after another* that can be reformulated: *It predicts the next ""chunk"" given all previous chunks, recursively* ?

Isn't talking, kind of NTP ?

```

╔════════════════╗      ╔════════╗      ╔══════════════════╗
║ Previous Words ║ ───► ║  Brain ║ ───► ║ Predict Next Word║
╚════════════════╝      ╚════════╝      ╚══════════════════╝
           ▲                                   │
           │                                   │
           │           Add to Context          │
           └───────────────────────────────────┘

```

2. **The most natural Solution**: While there are other approaches like text diffusion models, Next Token Prediction (NTP) is the most straightforward path. The basic control flow is elegantly simple:

```python
from skynet import predict_next_chunk

def ask_AGI(input: str) -> str:
    message = (f""user:{input}""
               ""\nassistant:"")

    while True:
        next_chunk = predict_next_chunk(message)
        if next_chunk == ""<!STOP!>"":
            return message
        
        message += next_chunk
```

Again, not the only way. Just the most natural

__________

**Key point**: ""Predict next chunk given all the previous chunks recursively"" (AKA Next Token Prediction) seems like the most natural way to produce language, hence, is a step towards AGI
____________

### A Time Machine Thought Experiment

Imagine having a time machine that can visit anywhere (anywhen ?) between the invention of the Turing test and 2005. You:

1. Gather brilliant minds from different eras (2005 Ilya Sutskever, not Elon, Alan Turing, definitely not Elon, 1995 Geoffrey Hinton...)
2. Put them in a room
3. Add a digital display with a countdown for dramatic effect
4. Ask them to specify AGI as a function. In Python for convenience (here AGI just means ""passes Turing test"")

Given their combined knowledge but without knowing about modern LLMs, they might well arrive at something like:

```python
def generate_response(context: str) -> str:
    response = """"
    while True:
        next_word = predict_next(context + response)
        if next_word == END_TOKEN:
            return response
        response += next_word
```
_________________


### From Text Generation to Agency

If Next Token Prediction (NTP) is the foundation, what's the next logical step? Let's think about it:

1. **NTP as a Function**: At its core, NTP is a text-to-text function:
```
╔═════════════╗     ╔═════════╗     ╔════════════╗
║ Input (Text)║ ──► ║   LLM   ║ ──► ║Output(Text)║
╚═════════════╝     ╚═════════╝     ╚════════════╝
```


2. **The Natural Extension**: From that, isn't the next step to make it ""do stuff"" ?


```
╔════════════╗    ╔═════╗     ╔═════════════╗
║Input (Text)║ ──►║ LLM ║ ───►║Output (Text)║
╚════════════╝    ╚═════╝     ╚═════════════╝
                     │
                     │      ╔═════════════════════════╗
                     └─────►║         Do Stuff        ║
                            ║(API calls, File changes)║
                            ╚═════════════════════════╝
                              
```

3. **Closing the Loop**: Once the model can affect the world, it naturally needs feedback about those effects:


```
╔════════════╗    ╔═══════╗     ╔═════════════╗
║Input (Text)║ ──►║  LLM  ║ ───►║Output (Text)║
╚════════════╝    ╚═══════╝     ╚═════════════╝
                   │   ▲
                   ▼   │gather information (feedback)
        ╔═════════════════════════╗
        ║         Do Stuff        ║
        ║(API calls, File changes)║
        ╚═════════════════════════╝
                              
```

And what way could we imagine doing that other than giving the LLM a syntax to use tools ?


```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║             Text containing syntax for tool use           ║
║ +instructions for a given task +some context for the task ║ 
╚═══════════════════╦═══════════════════════════════════════╝
                    ║
                    ▼
                ╔═════╗
                ║ LLM ║◀════════════════════╗
                ╚══╦══╝   Gather information ║              ║
                   ║                         ║
                   ▼                         ║
            ╔═══════════════════╗            ║
            ║ Text with tool use║            ║       
            ╚═══════╦═══════════╝            ║
                    ║                        ║
                    ▼                        ║       
                 ╔═══════════════════════════╩══════╗
                 ║ Execute tools: Affect the world  ║
                 ╚══════════════════════════════════╝
```


1. Can you describe any other way ?
2. Isn't that pretty much the very definition of agentic ?

___________________________

## The end goal: Competent Software Engineer as a Function

To sum up everything to this point:
- AGI being able to produce language, is likely to be based on Next Token Prediction
- The next step after LLM as chatbot (`As a function`: text=>text) is to give the LLM ability to ""do stuff"" + ""gather information""
- The end goal is to automate ""a competent Software Engineer""

________________

To understand what we're trying to automate, let's break down how I function as a software engineer:

👨🏻‍💻 Me `As a function`:

**Inputs:** Text messages (mail/Discord) containing: Requirements, documentation, credentials. (+Coffee ?)

**Processing:** Understanding requirements, planning solutions, writing code (mostly browse Stack Overflow and ask LLM to write code)

**Outputs:** Human interactions: Discord, Mails

**Side Effects:** Pull requests, Deployed features, updated repositories, running systems



Or something like:
```python
from reality import some_dude

print(
    some_dude(""""""Hello, Monica-Chang Von NGuyensky.
We're glad to have you on board.

I sent you your credentials in a mail. 
From now on, you'll be assigned Jira tickets to work on our project.
You can find processes, conventions, workflows (like how to use Jira and stuff) here: https://somecompany.ext/wiki .

Welcome to SomeCompany, world leader in ""Some Service"", expert in `Stuff` since some year in the past 🙂.""""""
    )
) # > Hi !
# + Side effect: I do all the work you'd expect from a Software Engineer
```

So, if we want to build AGI defined as ""a competent Software Engineer"", that's also more or less how we'd expect it to be used *As a function*

### My workflow

If the goal is to automate me, here's what my workflow looks like on a given day:

On a given day

- I check my mails and Discord messages. I check if I have Jira tickets in ""doing"" (If you don't know Jira, it's a tool where ""Tickets"" represent a task, a change to make to a project, eg: `Design and send a mail when user subscribes`
- If none, I take one is state `TODO`
- I gather its id/title/description
- I ask myself what project/git repo it's about
- I open some terminal and my IDE on this project
- I set `git` to the correct state (if you don't know what `git` is, it's a version control system that tracks changes in code and allows for collaborative work while managing different versions of a project. A ""repo"", is basically a project.).
  - I make sure I don't have uncommited changes
  - I refresh the repo from the server
  - I create a new branch with the name of the Jira ticket
- I ask myself if what the ticket is about is anything like things that already exists on the project.
- I identify the files to create, the files to take inspiration from (similar/related feature). Basically, keeping my example `Design and send a mail when user subscribes`, I'll look at files where mails are sent already, I'll look at existing mail templates.
- I'll mentally (or with notes) breakdown the actions to do and what I expect from the project once the feature is implemented. It could look like:
  - [ ] create `src/emails/confirm_subscription.html` looking at `src/emails/welcome.html`
  - [ ] in `src/handlers/purchase/subscribe.py`, update the function `on_subscribe` adding `send_mail(user, ""confirm_subscription"")`
  - [ ] Try subscribing on the dev environment to check if I receive the email.
  - [ ] Make sure I received the mail and everything looks fine (company's logo, user name, formulation...).

- ... I could go on but you probably get the idea, plus, that's enough material to describe how it could be automated

____________

**Key point**: If the goal is to automate me, we'd want a function that, given the inputs I'm given, would produce the same outputs and side effects.
_________

## What kind of agentic ?

**To sum up everything to this point**:
- LLMs are `text=>text` black boxes
- The obvious way forward it to give LLMs tools, to affect the world, gather information and act upon that information in a feedback loop (AKA agentic)
- I laid out an excerpt of my workflow
- Our end goal is to automate that workflow using agentic

**The point I'll try to make**: It's not any agentic. It's likely: Tree of agents/Flow Agentic/Swarm Agentic

______________

So, let's specify this AGI `As a function`. And let's call it `CoderAgent`

### CoderAgent part 1: `As a function`

Let's start with specifying what an agent automating my work would be like *As a function*


**Introduce `CoderAgent`**
(Thinking of each agent *As A Function* is useful, but being able to **USE** agents as functions is really damn sweet. The code bellow is actually how I use agents)

- `CoderAgent` `AAF`
```python
from agentix import Agent, Event

# Basic usage
response = Agent['CoderAgent'](""Can you work on the Jira ticket ABC-1234"")

# Or through Discord
@Event.on('discord_message')
def handle_message(msg):
    if msg['channel'] == 'coder-agent':
        Agent['CoderAgent'](msg['content'])
# ☝️ This works by the way. You'll be able to do just that if you come to my Discord
# Also, I have a pipeline to just talk out loud and it triggers agents
```

### CoderAgent part 2: `Implementation details`
#### **CoderAgent part 2.1: How I use my agents**

Using my framework `Agentix`, implementing an agent is quite simple
1. **Declare the agent**

```python
# agents/CoderAgent/agent/CoderAgent.py
from Agentix import Agent

Agent('CoderAgent', 'prompt|gpt4o|CoderAgent_loop')
```
_________
2. **Implement its middleware**
```python
# agents/CoderAgent/middlewares/CoderAgent_loop.py
from Agentix import mw, Conversation, parse_tools

@mw
def CoderAgent_loop(ctx, conv:Conversation):
    last_msg_content = conv[-1].content
    if ""<tool"" in last_message_content:
        tool_output = parse_tool
        return conv.rehop(f""<toolOutput>{tool_output}</toolOutput>)"")
    return last_message_content
```
☝️ To break down what that code does:
- If the LLM used a tool, 
  - its output will be appended to the conversation
  - The LLM will produce a new message in that conversation
  - `CoderAgent_loop` will then be executed again 
- If no tool use:
  - The last message from the LLM will be the output of the function

________

3. **Prompt the agent**

Create the file `agents/CoderAgent/prompts/CoderAgent.conv`
```yaml
system: You are CoderAgent.
{role explanation}

{context}

{tools documentation}
```

_________________________
4. **Use the agent**

You only have to do that. No import whatsoever anywhere, and you'll be able to use the agents from any file like this:

```python
from agentix import Agent

print(Agent['CoderAgent']('Do stuff plz'))
# > Done lol.
```
________________

**Note**: I'm going to illustrate further the flow of a given agent. The point is ""if tool use: LLM prompted with the output. If not: last assistant message returned as agent's output"". You can skip this part is that bit is clear, and jump to ""**CoderAgent part 2.2**: How we can approach implementing CoderAgent""



If an agent has tools, each time a tool is used, the output of the tool will be given as a reply in the conversation with the LLM.

Schematically:
```yaml
system: You're ShellAgent, you interact with an interactive shell with context persistence (like, if you go to a directory, the next command you'll run will happen in it)

## Memory
the project Foo is in /home/v/projects/Foo
## Tools
<tool name=""shell"">{shell command}</tool>
```

Running
```python
from agentix import Agent

print(
    Agent['ShellAgent'](
        'can you tell me what the current git branch is for Foo ?'
    )

Running that code would print:

The states the conversation would be in:
- **1**:
```yaml

#### **CoderAgent part 2.2**: How we can approach implementing CoderAgent

**Naive approach: Give it all the code and all the tools:**

If we give our agent the ability to run any shell command, all the files, and a way to write files, in principle, that should be enough to do absolutely anything (I insist on **in principle**. In practice that won't work at all and that's not a good approach)

```yaml
system: You are CoderAgent. You're an AGI and work as a software engineer.

Here's all the code you could work on:
### **All the code***
<codebase>
{whole_codebase}
</codebase>

### **Flow**
Use one tool per reply. 
When using a tool, you'll be prompted with its output.

### **Tools**
<tool name=""run"">pwd</tool>
<tool name=""write_file"" file_path=""some/path"">File content</tool>
```


_______________

**Limitations of this approach**

If you have somewhat experimented with agentic, you may know how such an agent would behave already.

With current LLMs, it would:
- Hallucinate a LOT.
- Get stuck in loops
- Not do what you asked for (except maybe for very trivial queries)

___________

**What works**

So, we can't automate a Software Engineer with one agent (at this point in time anyway)

One thing we can do though:  **Automate parts of it**

An concrete example: `JiraAgent`, an agent that tells you what you should work on next.

```python
from agentix import Agent

print(
    Agent['JiraAgent'](""What should I work on next"")
)
# > Ticket ABC-123
#    Title: A mail should be sent to user on subscription
#    Description: When user subscribes, bla bla mail bla.
```

____________________

We can also create:
- An agent that figures what project it's about
- An agent that will handle git
- An agent that you can ask any question to about your codebase
- An agent that edit code
- An agent that runs code and validate it with human in the loop

___________________

Bearing in mind that agents are black boxes with input/output/side effects
we can refactor `CoderAgent` and make its job to orchestrate other agents.

I explained earlier how the tool use flow works.

### Inter-Agent Communication

The key to making agents work together is enabling them to communicate. I created a `talk_to_agent` tool that lets agents delegate tasks to other specialized agents:

```yaml
system: You are CoderAgent, an orchestrator that coordinates other agents to complete software engineering tasks.

## Available Tools

<tool name=""talk_to_agent"" agent_name=""agent_name"">message</tool>
This tool lets you communicate with other agents. Each agent is specialized for a specific task:

- JiraAgent: Manages Jira tickets and task tracking
- ContextAgent: Sets up project context and environment
- Specificator: Breaks down tasks into detailed steps
- AskCodebase: Answers questions about code by:
  - Searching through relevant files
  - Understanding code patterns and architecture
  - Explaining how things work
  - Suggesting where to make changes
- ImplementCode: Makes reliable code changes by:
  - Creating/modifying files following best practices
  - Maintaining consistent code style
  - Adding tests when needed
  - Validating changes work as expected
- Human: It sends me (your coder) a DM

## Your Workflow

1. Get Current Task
   - If you don't know the current task, ask JiraAgent:
   `<tool name=""talk_to_agent"" agent_name=""JiraAgent"">What's my current task?</tool>`

2. Set Up Context
   - Have ContextAgent prepare the project:
   `<tool name=""talk_to_agent"" agent_name=""ContextAgent"">Please set up project X for task ABC-123</tool>`

3. Plan Implementation
   - Ask Specificator to create a detailed plan:
   `<tool name=""talk_to_agent"" agent_name=""Specificator"">Create checklist for implementing feature Y</tool>`

4. Get Approval
   - Validate the plan with a human:
   `<tool name=""talk_to_agent"" agent_name=""Human"">Please review this implementation plan: ...</tool>`

Remember: You are an orchestrator. Your job is to coordinate other agents, not to implement everything yourself.
```

This approach of having specialized agents coordinated by a ""manager"" agent is more reliable than trying to do everything in one agent. Each agent has a focused responsibility and clear interfaces for communication.

Now, the prompt I gave was for illustration of the principle. I haven't figured out the best flow yet. The good news it that we can automate the exploration of this search space with Agents.

**The key idea**: You won't succeed if you try to create an agent that has to handle complex workflows. But breaking down the workflow into smaller decisional processes/actions, you can achieve a lot more.

AGI will be agents, a lot of them, talking to each other.


This multi-agent approach:
- Breaks down complex tasks into manageable pieces
- Each agent has a focused responsibility
- Reduces hallucination through specialization
- Creates clear feedback loops


__________________

## Recursive Self-Improvement

While a single agent can't directly create other agents, 
- We CAN have an agentic pipeline that creates and improve prompts (google ""prompt breeder"" for an awesome paper about that)

- We CAN have an agentic pipeline that creates middlewares
- Same for tool implementation

## Final word

I've been experimenting extensively with these concepts, and the results have been genuinely exciting. My agents are already capable of:
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable pieces
- Understanding and navigating large codebases
- Making reliable code changes with proper testing
- Coordinating effectively through specialized roles

But this is just the beginning. I believe we're on the cusp of something transformative in software development. 
I'd love to explore it full-time with a community of passionate individuals.

If you've read this far, thank you! Your interest means a lot. I'm hoping to build a community around these ideas where I'll:
- Share all my work
- Create detailed tutorials
- Discuss your ideas. Textually or on a video call, a few times a week
- Help you implement any idea you can have

It was a cold Sunday morning, and the streets were flooded with fog. Emil gazed tiredly out of the window, sipping a cup of coffee. Driving in such dense fog was not an option. After finally finishing the renovations on his grandfather’s old vacation home, Emil had hoped to spend some time on his personal interests. But now, this dreadful fog had ruined his morning and darkened the second Sunday of Advent. If the weather didn’t clear up soon, Emil would have to walk to the concert 4 kilometers away—a daunting task for someone not accustomed to going outdoors.

He decided it was a good time to fetch the plastic Christmas tree from the attic, as waiting for the fog to clear felt like a test of patience he had no desire to endure. Emil climbed the stairs to the second floor and grabbed the rod to pull down the attic hatch. He ascended the ladder and looked around the attic, which, as usual, was spotless. The cleaning lady did an excellent job, even if she was an odd woman. She always dressed up as a Christmas elf and wore a strangely realistic mask.

The thought reminded him of the local band whose concert he planned to attend later that day. The band members also wore peculiar masks—sometimes even layering masks upon masks. Each of the five members had their own unique style. Emil grabbed the plastic tree and headed back toward the ladder. However, he hadn’t been paying attention to his surroundings and tripped over a box filled with his grandfather’s old belongings.

As he fell, a game tumbled out of the box. Emil got up, picked up the game, and inspected it. The title was almost unreadable: an ""S"" followed by three illegible letters and a ""b."" He set it back down, figuring it wasn’t anything important. Two photos that had also fallen from the box caught his eye.

One photo showed his grandfather and another person at a party—apparently a costume party, judging by their outfits. His grandfather wore a kind of red pajama with a medieval design and a cape, while the other person was dressed as a sort of demon, with gray skin and small orange horns. Emil wondered what kind of strange party that might have been. He put the photo aside and picked up the other one.

The second photo startled him. It showed the cleaning lady alongside his grandfather. How was that possible? The woman in the picture was unmistakably the same as she was now—young and unchanged—while his grandfather in the photo also appeared young. Emil found this extremely odd.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Quickly, he pocketed the photo and ran downstairs.",2,1734006549.0,homestuck,0,1.0,False
1hck0ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/EUCareers/comments/1hck0ww/volunteer_opportunity_writing_on_eu_digital_policy/,Volunteer Opportunity Writing on EU Digital Policy,"After unsuccessfully applying to the Blue Book traineeship, I thought I would start a small project while I look for internships in EU Digital Policy to add to my CV and to have something to do. After noticing growing buzz about the upcoming EU Digital Fairness Act, I thought I would start a newsletter.

So I started the [EU Digital Fairness Act Newsletter](https://digitalfairnessact.substack.com/). It's a simple little newsletter that I publish about twice a month which monitors this upcoming legislation. I don't have many subscribers yet but the few people who subscribe are EU civil servants, journalists, public affairs consultants... I'm also starting to get relevant consultants asking to get coffee in Brussels and job offers.

So I'm just exploring the possibility of having more people help me out to maintain the newsletter since it could be super beneficial for all of us looking for a job in EU Policy.

At the moment, tasks are really straight forward: 

* Monitoring info - usually by refreshing Google, LinkedIn, X, or EU sites. Sometimes reaching out to EU institutions or people to get documents or statements.
* Compiling all info - clearly in a single document.
* Writing the newsletter - writing usually starts when we have enough interesting info (every couple weeks).
* Publishing the newsletter
* Writing posts for Linkedin and X with links to the newsletter.

You can add it to your CV and it could be a good opportunity to get in touch with people working on EU Digital Policy within and outside the EU's institutions. I'm afraid this would be totally unpaid unless we eventual monetise the newsletter.

I'm just throwing this out there as an idea so feel free to DM me on [Reddit](https://chat.reddit.com/user/t2_e8a0y) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamestamim/) if you are interested in potentially helping out!",2,1734006520.0,EUCareers,0,1.0,False

As authorities pieced together the baffling timeline of Luigi Mangione’s alleged involvement in the events surrounding the attack on UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, one thing became abundantly clear: Luigi Mangione was everywhere. For 24 hours straight, he was seen, tracked, and accounted for in an astonishing number of locations, from Maryland to Delaware to Washington D.C.—without once slipping out of sight.

With every minute of his whereabouts accounted for, investigators had no choice but to declare Mangione’s alibis rock-solid. But while the legal system may absolve him of guilt, another victim remains in this bizarre saga: Luigi Mangione’s bladder. Because, in those 24 hours of being constantly visible, not once did this man step away to relieve himself.

A Timeline of Constant Visibility

Let’s recap the most surreal 24 hours of Luigi Mangione’s life. At 6:30 AM, he was photographed sipping coffee at a Maryland diner, engaged in an animated conversation about the Orioles. At 8:15, witnesses spotted him jogging along the National Mall in D.C., waving to tourists. By noon, he was caught on CCTV at a food truck, buying a falafel.

And the sightings kept coming. In the afternoon, he was seen helping a Boy Scout troop set up a tent, and later, he popped up at a Delaware jazz bar, clapping along enthusiastically to a saxophone solo. Every hour brought new accounts of Mangione smiling, walking, chatting—but never once excusing himself to visit a restroom.

Authorities confirmed: not a single break in his alibi. Not a single bathroom break, period.

Mangione’s Bladder: A Hero’s Tale

The sheer logistical impossibility of this bladder feat has left experts stunned.

“It’s already an anomaly for someone to spend 24 hours on the move without a moment of privacy,” said Dr. Sylvia Peabody, a urologist now thrust into the bizarre spotlight of “bladdergate.” “But to do so without once using a bathroom? That’s beyond human endurance. That’s bladder Olympian-level performance.”

Social media was, of course, quick to latch onto the absurdity. One viral tweet read: “Forget the alibi. Forget the crime. How is Luigi Mangione’s bladder not in the Smithsonian?”

Another quipped: “If Luigi Mangione’s bladder could testify, it’d say, ‘I’M the one under pressure.’”

Memes Turn Mangione’s Bladder Into a Legend

From TikTok to Instagram, Luigi Mangione’s bladder has become a meme-worthy icon.

One viral post shows a split-screen image: on one side, Mangione helping a Boy Scout; on the other, a visibly straining water balloon with the caption: “Luigi’s bladder: ‘Hold the line, boys!’”

Another meme superimposes Mangione onto a world map, marking his precise locations with the caption: “Seen everywhere. Peed nowhere.”

Brands are also cashing in. Charmin tweeted: “Even WE think Luigi Mangione’s bladder deserved a break. #BladderGoals.”

The Science Behind the Mystery

While the public marvels at Mangione’s endurance, experts are scrambling for explanations. Some theorize he drank nothing but espresso, minimizing fluid intake while maintaining high energy. Others suspect he trained his bladder in advance, though the utility of such a skill remains dubious.

Conspiracy theorists, naturally, have their own ideas. “Luigi Mangione isn’t a man,” claimed one Redditor. “He’s a government cyborg designed to endure anything, including never peeing. Wake up, people!”

Dr. Peabody, however, offered a simpler take: “Bladder control like this usually comes with consequences. If Mangione’s bladder could talk, it’d probably be asking for workers’ comp.”

A New Symbol of Resilience

With Luigi Mangione’s alibi ironclad, his bladder has emerged as the unsung hero of the ordeal. While the man himself dodges accusations, his bladder dodged the even greater challenge of nature’s call—all while remaining under constant observation.

“Imagine being Luigi’s bladder,” tweeted one user. “You’re under pressure for 24 hours straight, in front of everyone, and you STILL don’t crack. Absolute legend.”

Another tweet summed it up perfectly: “Forget the crime. Luigi Mangione’s bladder deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor.”

What’s Next for Luigi’s Bladder?

As the legal drama unfolds, Mangione’s bladder remains a beacon of absurd endurance. Whether it’s science, luck, or sheer willpower that kept him going, one thing is clear: Luigi Mangione’s bladder has earned its place in history.

So next time you’re waiting in line for the restroom, remember: Luigi Mangione spent 24 hours in plain sight, without a single bathroom break. If he can do that, you can hold it for a few more minutes. Absolute legend.

1hcjtu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcjtu3/during_my_wifes_pregnancy_i_m31_gained_130lbs_in/,"During my wife’s pregnancy, I (M31) gained 130lbs in 9+ months, all in my belly—now stuck with a 67” gut, looking overdue w/ quadruplets. Doctors say it’s the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‘sympathetic pregnancy’ they’ve ever seen. How to prepare for seeing family and our twins’ arrival?","Hi everyone, I’ve been dealing with this extremely bizarre and surreal situation over the past year, and I could really use some advice. With the holidays approaching and the twins’ arrival getting closer, I’m trying to mentally and physically prepare for what’s ahead—whether that’s navigating family reactions over Christmas or figuring out how I can be the best partner to my wife once the babies arrive, even with my current size and challenges. If anyone has thoughts or suggestions, I’d appreciate it.

I never thought I’d be writing this, but after what’s happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I’m living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children—twins!—and her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what’s called Couvade Syndrome, or “sympathetic pregnancy,” where men mimic some of their partner’s pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny—me complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

Within 9+ months, I’ve gained over 130 pounds, and it’s all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition—Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they’ve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife’s pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here’s the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It’s perfectly round, heavy, and tight—so much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I’ve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public’s stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, “When are you due?” or “Are you having twins—or is it triplets?” Sometimes, people assume I’m joking when I say I’m not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling “Hey, heifer! How’d you get so huge, fatass!” and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, “When are the babies due?” and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, “Are you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you’re about to pop!” His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn’t pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like “Damn, bro, that’s the most impressive belly I’ve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That’s crazy.”

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called “the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.” The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife’s parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn’t believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it’s become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife’s.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife’s pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She’s been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I’m taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can’t help feeling guilty—this was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I’m the one everyone’s talking about.

Meanwhile, I’ve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don’t fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I’ve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don’t last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren’t any better—they’re so tight under the curve of my gut that I’ve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I’m required to wear a uniform—a button-up shirt, no less—and squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I’m sure they’ll pop, and they often do—sometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I’ve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I’m outgrowing something else, to the point where I’m running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it’s going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I’ve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal—it feels like I’m wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I’ve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They’ve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they’ve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it’s hard not to feel like a sideshow. I’ve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I’ve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there’s a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I’d wake up nauseous when she did, I’d have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I’d have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn’t just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body’s hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I’ve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn’t helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I’m not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it’s all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I’ve been experiencing—like elevated prolactin and cortisol levels—have completely derailed any sense of self-control. It’s as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I’ve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn’t anymore… Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of “hyper-storage mode,” where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it’s mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it’s created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It’s crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult—and frankly embarrassing—symptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it’s such a large part of the psychological side effects I’ve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be “confusing” my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I’m meant to desire or enjoy. It’s almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They’ve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop—my body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I’ve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices—like overeating or not avoiding tight clothes—that exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It’s created a cycle where I feel like I’m feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body’s way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don’t want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I’ve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It’s such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it’s my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it’s hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I’m doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I’m still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I’ve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth—or if this is something I’ll be living with for the rest of my life.

Now that you’ve read all that, you can probably imagine how overwhelming this has been—not just for me, but for my wife and our family as well. Christmas is coming up, and it’ll be the first time many family members see me in person since this transformation. I know they’re already shocked by the photos, but I have no idea how to handle their reactions when I walk in the room. Do you think I should try to diffuse the awkwardness with humor, or just brace myself for the comments and move on? I’d love to hear how you think I can prepare for that emotionally.

Also, with the twins on the way, I’m worried about how I’ll physically keep up with helping my wife care for two newborns. Even simple tasks like getting up quickly or bending over are incredibly difficult now, and I don’t want her to feel like she’s doing everything on her own. Has anyone here dealt with physical limitations while caring for babies? What are some ways I can make sure I’m still present and helpful despite my size and lack of mobility?

Finally, I’d be curious to hear if you’ve ever come across a case like this, or if you have any ideas I haven’t thought of about how to better manage the reactions, logistics, or even just the emotional toll. Thanks for reading and for any advice you can offer!

1hcjs7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hcjs7o/does_she_like_me_i_cant_read_body_language_well/,Does she like me? (I can’t read body language well enough),"To make a long story short,

I am a contractor/technician, my office is my vehicle, and I report to multiple different sites on a daily basis, usually four or five different companies.

On this particular call, the receptionist girl would not vacate my presence like normally, even though she most likely had responsibilities herself, I didn’t care though I’m not a tattletale, because honestly, she is exactly my type, told me that she is only a couple months off from my actual birthday, so we are in essence, the same age. 

Needless to say, I could not let the opportunities pass by, so I asked her out for coffee, after she explained her favorite coffee shop was right down the road, and I asked this in the most appropriate way I could given that I was on my own clock and retain a strong sense of professionalism… even though nobody is watching over me directly. 

The conversation went like this: 
Me: A simple “how’s your day so far* with a smile, I was a bit smitten, blushing perhaps, no mirror to confirm.

Her “I love this one coffee shop down the street, it’s to die for” (something like that), 

Me: “I’ve never been there, but it sounds amazing, and it seems like you would be the one to show me around, which I would definitely not be opposed to… I hope that I’m not being too forward, but here are my contact details *hand her my friend/non-business, and regular for-business card* 

She gladly accepted my invitation, saying yes, and she seemed very happy, pupils dilated, totally not the type of girl either to do drugs, so that was natural endorphins, causing the dilation, I over analyze because I’m on the spectrum, which makes me extremely good at what I do for my work, but extremely bad at picking up on body language, I am much better at making friends with machines. Let’s just say that, I’m a repairman of the highest caliber. She still didn’t leave, just for one second because her boss needed something and then she came right back, essentially just watching and learning, huge smile on her face, she was blushing, unless it was makeup- indicating that she does enjoy my presence from my own viewpoint.

I have never been able to instinctually tell if somebody has an interest in me, so based on what I’ve described here, do you think that I was unprofessional which I definitely think is a possibility, or do you think that I was handling it in the most professional way I could? Or somewhere in between? 

I really do know how to communicate corporate style, because it is essentially a language, you learn over time by working different jobs. As far as dating language, 

It’s pretty much like my mind never developed to that instinctual ability, so in order to compensate, I have to over analyze any kind of situation like this. In the past, it has been like this too, I end up liking girls that actually hate me, and the girls that actually do like me, I can’t tell at all, my Spidey sense is missing in that regard, so what can one do? Think think think. Do you think she likes me, or just has a bubbly personality that I’ve never quite encountered before?

So i upgraded literally within days. The owner and her business partner come from the very high up levels of society and have started the club as a vessel for a girl owner to be able to express her knowledge and passion for the witchcraft anonymously. When i tell you the level of quality and amount of info and rituals that's been put into it ( honestly for any kind of problem, from money, career, grades, love, break ups, beauty, hexes , cleanses, success, opportunity, mind manipulation etc etc) is insane. They are definately undercharging. People charge 3000 on tik tok for one spell with no guarantees, the celebrity witch club charges 60 a month ( basic membership) for hundreds of spells that have been tested by 100s of people inside the club plus the owners post only those rituals they have done and tested themselves. (Keep in mind that the club is famous in the entertainment industry, many members are models, bigger you tubers etc) I have even sent the owner an email saying she majorly under values her work as she has 1000s reviews and needs to charge more  (if anybody thinks the reviews are not real u need your head checked and ur tin foil hat removed as to create 1000s of reviews u need 100s of sim cards,ig allows 5 accounts or so per one phone, so to create 1000s of reviews u need to have no life, 1000s of ig accounts, 100s of phones lol and a level 10 of psychopathy to create full blown conversations d a i l y and then post them all 10 times a day for years. For years, cuz CW posts multiple live reviews into her ig stories daily, for years. Plus anybody who is new to the club has access to speak to anybody who sent a review) anyway i want to talk about the results . I came to the club as a broke ass rat, freshly graduated, depressed , with no life, as in i did not know what to do with it, everything was shit. Things were just stale. It was bad, i was in a bad spot, it was horrible. I started by doing her cleanses, and when i tell you it was life changing i will not be lying. Within DAYS the depression lifted, i started waking up with joy just because the sky was blue , i started going on long walks just breathing when before i would only venture out if needed. I became more peaceful so to speak within myself. Then i concentrated on removing blocks whatever was holding me in that shitty life style and did a few luck spells. AND FFS I GOT THE FUCKING JOB I DREAMT OF SINCE I WAS IN THE UNI!!!! I FREAKING GOT A JOB AT A PR COMPANY IN NYC THAT DOES CAMPAIGNS FOR THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES AND PAYS A BANK!!!! How was that possible??????? i was trying to get into pr for a few years after graduating from a european uni ( my english is not even that good!) and did a few internships here and there, had a small time office job in a random pr firm in germany but that's that, i then moved to nyc just to experience life and maybe seek better opportunities. I now have a beautiful one bedroom flat with a central park view, i wake up full of enthusiasm, i put on a beautiful saint laurent suit i thrifted ( heheheh), get my coffee and go to my dream job where i feel like i am accomplishing things and living my dream life and i know that there is much more to come!
