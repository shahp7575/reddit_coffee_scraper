For context, im very inexperienced with woodworking and building stuff in general, but id love to give it a shot, maybe it could be as simple as buying legs and a tabletop, sort of fitting it together? 

I can get basic tools like a drill and a saw, which should make things easier. 

If I could get insights on the best place to acquire materials, and roughly what kinda stuff id need, i would really appreciate it.

1j9gijn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j9gijn/bad_coffee_or_no_coffee_sage_barista_express/,Bad Coffee or no coffee [Sage Barista Express],"Hello everyone!

  
I just received my Barista Express and I feel like I am losing my mind, so I could use some help.

  
I got a bag of Costa Signature Blend (I know they might not be the best out there but it is what it is) and I can't pull a single espresso out of the machine. I have tried using both double shot baskets, adjusting the grind from 5 to 1, adjusting the coffee dose, etc. Here is a breakdown:

At first I used the single wall basket that came attached to the portafilter, grind size 4 and the coffee dose at ""half"" (around 17g). I prepared everything, the timer, the scale, etc. I tamped the coffee as leveled as I could, but when I extracted, the pressure gauge didn't even move, 30g of coffee in few seconds. Then I went with grind size 3, same coffee dose, again, not enough pressure. When I used the grind size 2 or 1, I upped the coffee dose a bit, because I was not getting 17-18 grams out of the grinder. Now the gauge goes to the lower level of the ""espresso pressure"", but I am still getting the 34-36 grams of coffee in under 20 seconds.

  
I said ok, maybe it's the basket. I installed the dual wall one, grind size 1, when I started extracting, the pressure went right to the middle of the espresso zone, and I said that's it, I nailed it. Jokes on you, I got no extraction. I went to grind size 2, again no extraction even if the pressure gauge was at the right point. When I went to grind size 3-4, the coffee poured very chaotically, splattering everything around and the coffee was so sour I wasn't able to swallow it.

Then I started adjusting everything over and over again, using both baskets and so on, wasted more than half kg of coffee and I wasn't able to pour one good espresso.

I am on the verge of returning the machine, even if I don't want to do it. Can you guys give me some advice on what to try next?

1j9ga0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9ga0l,"Started KETO Jan 2nd and still going, some notes.","Definitely felt much much better physically/mentally.  Just noticed it straight away.

Had a while where I was feeling a bit down but that passed.

I‚Äôve definitely broken keto a few times, especially when working away, in Paris and there was too much food on offer and I couldn‚Äôt really choose what I wanted.  In this case I accepted I‚Äôd probably break keto and to enjoy it but not be super greedy. I avoided potatoes, rice, pasta as a non negotiable and as soon as I was home got back on it.

I often Intermitent fast without trying, if I eat keto I tend not to be so hungry.

I find/found when going to bed I would usually snack.  Breaking that habit was hard and I‚Äôd have to down a pint of water and then in the morning realise I was fine and then I‚Äôd aim for lunch before eating, then it would often be dinner.  Not starving myself, just breaking old habits.

To ease any sweet tooth cravings I drink zero carb/sugar cheap energy drinks.  No more than a can or two a day.  They really feel like a treat/reward now.

Enjoy a Pepsi max if I‚Äôm out or on the weekend or when at families.

Black coffee always.

Green tea always.

And the results‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt weight myself to start.  I want it to be obvious to me I‚Äôve lost weight and first it went around my face.  I do look a bit older I think but that‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôm just me.

I have definitely lost a fair bit around my stomach and it‚Äôs been super nice being able to buy large or even medium clothes and have them fit and not stand in the dressing room and see myself in the mirror and think how the fk do I look so bad!

As a result I‚Äôve seen an improvement in my work, my general time management, I‚Äôm not feeling fat when working, I‚Äôm not instantly exhausted when gardening.  I do more chores.

I did start doing work outs too but dropped that as I hated it and just confided on keto/rough calories (2000) and trying to never go above 20g carbs in a day.

If I did go over 20g I just pick it up the next day and start again.

As someone advised here, I make some boiled eggs and chicken drumsticks and leave them in the fridge for snacks.

I started with huge feats of meals but have now started to ease into reducing portion sizes.  Again, it‚Äôs about breaking habits for me.

Hardest time was/is family birthdays, kids parties, when there is an abundance of pizza and nuggets and all the things I love but can‚Äôt.

I also buy a lot of good Parma type ham, salami, chorizo, cheese packs for snacks/lunch and always look at the back for carbs.  They differ quite a lot.

Overall I feel excellent result for the effort I‚Äôve put in and it‚Äôs been fun.  I eat really well.  Just changed the diet.

Posted some pics - many of these I‚Äôve posted before but they are a good summary of what I‚Äôve been eating.

Thanks and good luck to anyone starting/into it, keep going.",3,1741772386.0,ketobeginners,2,1.0,False

The flickering crystal lights buzzed with barely-contained magical energy, and the espresso machines hissed like trapped steam elementals.

Behind the counter, Gibz, an underpaid and overcaffeinated goblin, adjusted his ill-fitting green apron and tried not to think about how his shift had seven more hours to go. He‚Äôd already dealt with an orc who tried to pay in battle trophies and a vampire who insisted on an oat blood latte.

Then the elf walked in.

Not just any elf, a Highborn Lunar Elf, dressed in flowing celestial silks, with cheekbones so sharp they could cut through the corporate bureaucracy itself. He drifted up to the counter, radiating the kind of arrogance that only comes from living for 800 years and still thinking retail workers are beneath you.

Gibz sighed. ""Welcome to Starbucks. What can I get started for you today?""

The elf wrinkled his nose like he‚Äôd just been offended by the concept of labor.

""Yes, you there. I require an Eldritch Ambrosia.""

Gibz blinked. ""A what now?""

The elf exhaled dramatically, as if explaining himself was an act of charity.

""You do serve it, correct? It's a drink of exquisite refinement, composed of Void Kraken Ink, Liquid Starlight, and a whisper of shattered Faerie Wings.""

Gibz rubbed his temples. ""Buddy, we got pumpkin spice, cold brew, and whatever that mystery syrup in the back is. You ain't getting no liquid starlight in a paper cup.""

The elf gave him a look normally reserved for peasants who dared to breathe near his estate. ""I do not drink from paper. I require it in a chalice, ideally carved from the fang of an elder dragon.""

Gibz stared at him. Then he turned to the line of exhausted commuters, a troll tapping away on a laptop, and a fairy mumbling about being late for her shift.

He looked back at the elf.

""Sir,"" he said slowly, ""we have cups. You can have a cup.""

The elf‚Äôs eye twitched. ""But it must be stirred counterclockwise, lest it destabilize the fabric of my fate.""

Gibz picked up a spoon, stirred the empty air counterclockwise exactly once, and slapped it on the counter. ""Boom. Consider fate stabilized.""

The elf sniffed, displeased. ""You clearly don‚Äôt understand. Fine. I shall have a triple shot lunar-infused espresso with starfire orchid petals and a single drop of Frostbloom Pollen, lightly dusted with Obsidian Rose Petals, infused with-""

""You‚Äôre getting a black coffee,"" Gibz interrupted, already punching it into the register.

The elf gasped. ""You dare?""

Gibz did not get paid enough for this.

""Do you want room for cream, or are you gonna write a poem about how that ruins the ‚Äòdelicate cosmic balance‚Äô of your drink?""

The elf clutched his chest like he‚Äôd been personally attacked. ""I- I shall take it black, as it is meant to be.""

Gibz handed him the cup. ""That'll be five crowns.""

The elf sniffed, reached into his velvet coin pouch, and slammed down a single ancient gold piece bearing the face of a long-forgotten king. ""This should cover it.""

Gibz held up the coin. ""We don‚Äôt take artifacts.""

The elf groaned and begrudgingly handed over the money. He took his cup, sipped it‚Ä¶ then closed his eyes in deep, dramatic suffering.

""This,"" he whispered, ""tastes like regret.""

Gibz leaned on the counter. ""Yep. Welcome to Starbucks.""",0,1741772178.0,shortstories,1,0.5,False

Initially I loved it, and in a lot of ways I still love it, but unfortunately the hospitality industry isn‚Äôt as progressive as other industries in terms of workers rights. I‚Äôm not sure how it is in other countries besides the ones I‚Äôve worked in, but the pay isn‚Äôt great, breaks are at a minimum and over all the work life balance could be better in a lot of coffee shops. 


I also felt like what I was doing wasn‚Äôt good enough (I didn‚Äôt feel this from myself, but others). Toxic comments like ¬´¬†when are you going to get a career job¬†¬ª, and the stigma of being a barista closing in on 30 got to me.


The physical stress from the lack of workers rights, and the mental stress of judgement got to me and I broke. I quit my barista job, and I got an low stress office admin job. 


Initially I couldn‚Äôt believe how chill working in an office was. I feel like 80% of the time I‚Äôm not working, and the admin work is pretty easy. I also started to feel less judged. Even though I do less work, people seem to view me as more together just because I write emails now instead of making coffee. 


This was all well and good originally, but now life is feeling dull. The work day is boring. Even when I have work to do, it‚Äôs done quickly and then I‚Äôm back on Reddit for the day. I feel like there‚Äôs no personality in the job, and I worry I‚Äôm becoming boring. I miss the chats with people, and my social skills have gotten worse. 


I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I fear I will get depressed if life stays life this. I miss being a barista, but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll end up stressed out again.

I've been on the 0.25 dose for 5 weeks, not 4. (The last week before I was supposed to increase my dosage I had terrible headaches so I decided to give my body one more week on 0.25.) So this is my 6th week on Ozempic. 

While I was on 0.25 I had coffee a few times and in all of them I ended up super nauseous so I stopped drinking it altogether. I've been drinking green tea this whole time, it's also something I drank regularly even before Ozempic. It was okay with 0.25. After switching to 0.5 though, I start to feel even green tea is starting to make me nauseous. I never tried it since the new dosage but I'm guessing now matcha is out of the question, too. 

Also it's worth noting, besides this caffeine problem, I don't usually have nausea anymore. I had it in my first and second weeks and then it gradually went away.

So, my question is, did anyone here had such caffeine sensitivity as a side effect that even the caffeine in green tea started to bother them? Also what can I drink now, if I need a pick me up? ",1,1741771679.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been together for 9 years and he‚Äôs mostly treated me well. I‚Äôm very loved and very spoiled and I love it and I love him. 

He got a new job last year and his coworkers skew young and female. For reference he‚Äôll be 35 soon and I just turned 33. His coworkers are mostly in their early 20s.  I never really had any issues with this until he began acting differently.

The first instance was he went out and got really drunk with them and he even ended up going to a second location with one of them, just the two of them.  This is completely out of character for him. For one, he‚Äôs not really a social person, he‚Äôs really introverted and hardly ever goes out. Secondly, he‚Äôs not someone to get drunk. In all our years together, I‚Äôve only ever seen him get drunk once and it was over Christmas which sort of doesn‚Äôt count. 

The second instance was he mentioned to me once that he would like to meet up for a coffee with one of them. He‚Äôs gone back to uni and she is staring uni so they‚Äôll be in the same location. He brought it up casually but there was something about the way he brought it up that rubbed me the wrong way. We ended up having a massive argument about it where he was gaslighting me the whole time. We‚Äôve never had the type of relationship where it was ok for either of us to catch up one-on-one with someone of the opposite sex. He would definitely not be ok with me doing that, I know because it has come up. 

The third instance was he was keen on me meeting them so he organised for us to do a pub quiz together. I met some of them, things went ok and we began meeting for the quiz semi regularly.  One time I was feeling a little unwell (nothing contagious) and he kept insisting I go home. He was so insistent that I go home that it became awkward for me to stay.  I had to walk home by myself while he stayed. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable but my expectation was that if I was leaving, we both left. Mostly because he‚Äôs usually a really caring and attentive partner and I‚Äôm convinced that if we were with another group of people, he would have left with me. 

Finally, over Christmas we went over seas and he bought them a bag of these specialist lollies and he never mentioned it to me. We were just chilling one day when I went to open the lollies and he let me know that he was saving them for his coworkers. I asked him why he never told me about them during the trip and he sort of exploded yelling at me, telling me he didn‚Äôt want me getting angry about it. I was shocked and taken aback by his outburst. We went back and forth until I got tired and told him to do what he wanted, I didn‚Äôt care.  I wasn‚Äôt really upset he got them the bag of lollies, it just rubbed me the wrong way that he purposefully didn‚Äôt tell me about it and now was being all angry that I was asking him why he never told me about them. 

Am I being crazy and insecure? The thing is I‚Äôm an up front person. I‚Äôm honest about my thoughts and feelings, even when it‚Äôs hard to talk about. Our whole relationship, he‚Äôs been the opposite. It‚Äôs taken so much effort from me to get him to talk about issues and it‚Äôs taken years for him to admit things that I clocked in the moment. I‚Äôm scared my gut feeling is right and something is happening between him and one of his coworkers and he‚Äôs not admitting to it. At this point I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actual cheating or flirting but I think it‚Äôs something. This man has not made a single friend in any of his jobs in all the years I‚Äôve known him and now suddenly he‚Äôs good friends with a group of young women? It‚Äôs so weird.

I (F55) have been out of the dating game for a decade. The apps are soul-destroying, and the whole process felt exhausting and tedious rather than fun and playful. So I just ‚Ä¶ stopped. 

I started working with a boy (M47?) for a few months. And it‚Äôs been fun. This was a project btw - set end date, large company, neither of us are in the same reporting line, and the project is now closed. We may collaborate on other projects in future but don‚Äôt work together on a daily basis. Since the project ended, we catch up regularly for coffee and/or lunch at work. 

The banter is fun. We have a similar sense of humor and I‚Äôve enjoyed being able to flex a muscle that has been atrophying over recent years. Nothing inappropriate for work, but we do bounce off each other well. And I‚Äôve missed having this type of interaction. 

He‚Äôs separated, a couple of years before we met. And there have been definite hints. He talks about coming into the office just because I‚Äôm going to be there (hybrid work) and how much he enjoys our conversation. 

So I took a shot and invited him out. I was planning to wait till the end of the project but I was feeling lonely one weekend and there may have been wine involved. And he politely turned me down. Disappointing but ok. We managed to avoid making the situation awkward and still chat and banter at work, although I dialled it down a notch. 

But I‚Äôm still detecting flirting on his side. And because he turned me down, I feel I have to pretend it‚Äôs just innocent banter. And maybe it is just innocent banter and I‚Äôm completely misreading the situation. I definitely can‚Äôt ask him out again because then I‚Äôm the crazy stalker who has to have awkward conversations with HR.

I‚Äôve been out of the game too long and feel like a dumb teenager. I feel that backing off is the right thing to do - I enjoy his company and would like to be friends but maybe I‚Äôm making things harder for myself and keeping hope alive where there is none. In the last week it feels like something has shifted on his side - he‚Äôs more attentive, and slipping in more personal compliments into conversation (still nothing inappropriate). 

I‚Äôm well aware how juvenile this all sounds. Past history has me second guessing myself - I‚Äôm bouncing from ‚Äúhe‚Äôs definitely interested‚Äù to ‚Äúof course he‚Äôs not interested, get over yourself‚Äù and back again. It has literally been years since I‚Äôve dated - I had basically resigned myself to spending the remainder of my life alone. Meeting him has woken a part of myself that I thought was long dead, and a part of me doesn‚Äôt want to give up that feeling. 

I‚Äôm hella confused. Is he waiting for something? He‚Äôs commenced divorce proceedings which feels like the natural conclusion of one part of your life and the commencement of another. Or maybe he has no intentions other than trading dad jokes and perhaps feeling a little flattered by my attention. Perhaps I‚Äôm just a sad, lonely, middle-aged woman who is seeing interest where there is none. 

Help!

TL;DR: Asked a colleague out, was politely declined. He continues to flirt and I‚Äôm confused. ",1,1741771201.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

How could this happen?

Seems unlikely that Windows hello would have recognised me on initial power up or from 6 feet away.

So it started around end of august 2024 when my, at the time girlfriend had just got back with our 6 year old boy from their summer holidays in poland (she is polish but had lived in london since 2007 with her ex husband who was an abusive alcoholic, (so she said for the first 3 years we were together), at her mums where she grew up. We got together end of summer 2017. She got pregnant in February 2018.

So, From the minute i picked them up i noticed the way she looked at me and it was something id never felt before from her. Rewind back up until then i can honestly say although our relationship had its ups and downs we were happy and in love, we had a great sex life and she always showed me heaps of affection, although throughout she had always said that i will probably leave her for somebody younger or will get bored and cheat on her. I told her she was crazy as she was everything i ever wanted in a woman, blonde, blue eyes, very pretty and her body was amazing, and for the first few years her personality was incredible. Perfect in every way....


We hadnt had sex for about 2 weeks before she went away so i was expecting some loving when she got home and how she missed me etc, like every other summer before. This time was different. She said she just wasn't feeling it. So she starts back to work at a local secondary school as a teacher assistant which she loves. I notice over the next few months how much more effort she puts into getting ready in the mornings, more make up going on than ever before, new perfumes, constantly buying new clothes and shoes and her hair done. In the nean time we had gone out a few times to the local pub or for some food, with nearly no effort made in the same sense. This carried on and is still apparent until we split yesterday.


Then there was thr change in her phone use or should i say protectiveness. One night we were watching a film and i reached over to the coffee table to get her glass which was near her screen down phone and she jolted for it. Never had she done anything like this before. Alarm bells are ringing in my head and from then she had my full attention like never before. Phone was on Silent every evening and at weekends and the screen was always face down and by her side, her never leaving it out of her sight for too long unless she was wearing her smartwatch which she used to take straight off when she got home and put on her dresser. Our sex life plummeted more and more and even when i tried to make more of an effort to seduce her she would pull away more. Sex only happened when it suited her, which i never had to ask for all those years before i could help myself as she used to say its mine so have it. 


I proposed on xmas eve to which she said yes and how long shes waited to be my wife and to be patient with her as she thought she was starting menopause which was why her libido had drastically dropped. She even went for blood tests after xmas to determine what the issues were. I said we just needed to be how it was at the beginning but she was adamant it was her hormones. Tests showed everything normal. So back she went to work after xmas, dressed up to the nines everyday more makeup and new hair. Fast forward to the 30th jan when she went for drinks with the girls from work. Wasn't home late, but was gatted drunk and hair in a state which i found strange.

Ill go back to September when i bought a 12 pack of condoms from amazon as we both agreed we don't want anymore kids and in the past i have got carried away when shes asked me not to finish inside due to ovulating. Fair enough. Never lasted long as we only used 1.


From 30th jan to when i checked the box again on the 7th feb, 2 had gone missing. So i watched with a beady eye from then on. Btw i only counted them because she had moved them from the bedside drawer to the basket in the wardrobe which i found weird and when i noticed 2 gone. Id checked probably every 3 days after and on the 7th march I noticed 1 more had gone. Then on the 9th March, the box had been moved back into the dresser and 1 had magically reappeared! I waited until that night and asked her outright where they had gone and why they kept getting moved around. Ive never seen my ex fiance get so angry and straight away say that were done and there's no going back from this. I did say if it wasnt her then it was her daughter (F18) and why is she taking my condoms without asking. She said shes not going to ask her and im pathetic. I went to her daughter's bedroom and asked her politely and told her not to worry im glad if she did but she should of asked. She said no, she has her own.


 I then said to her so if you didnt take them then it must have been your mum and that means she's been cheating, she then said oh if that's the case then yes i did. She proved to me that i couldn't trust her either. I found it strange in the latter months leafing up to this that it seemed like she had a hold over my ex as before their relationship was different. So today i told my ex that i had apologised to her daughter if i embarrassed her, and she said that her daughter never took them, but wouldn't give me a yes or no if she did, just called me poison, toxic and i should be in a mental asylum. She also said that she doesnt feel sorry for me anymore and to get away from her and take my stuff and go sleep in my car if i have to. Obviously last night i slept on the sofa after walking the streets for hours sobbing into my jumper hood.

She didn‚Äôt bring me a gift, which is fine, I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything extravagant, but she did bring donuts. The issue is how everything went down.

That morning, she texted me, ‚ÄúHappy birthday girl! You better not be late because I brought something for you.‚Äù I told her, ‚ÄúOh my god, I‚Äôm sorry, I might be running late.‚Äù She started sending voice messages telling me to hurry up, and a few minutes later, she sent a video of herself eating the donuts and said, ‚ÄúThis is what you get for being late.‚Äù

I arrived at school 10 minutes late and went straight to the library (I was stressed about a huge exam and needed time alone). My mental health was at an all-time low, and I didn‚Äôt feel like interacting with anyone. I figured she‚Äôd understand that, but I guess not.

For context, my birthday is December 22, but she only brought me something on December 30. I wasn‚Äôt mad about it, but it‚Äôs kind of ironic. The next day, she started avoiding me and giving me attitude whenever she was forced to talk to me. And then things got WEIRD.

One morning, she and my other friend, Jasmina, were ordering coffee. I was reading nearby, not paying attention. Amelia turned to me and said, ‚ÄúHey, unknown, you want something?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize she was talking to me at first, but when Jasmina tapped me and said, ‚ÄúSara, do you want anything?‚Äù it hit me‚Äîshe was deliberately refusing to say my name. 

Since then, she‚Äôs been calling me ‚Äúunknown,‚Äù making it clear I‚Äôm dead to her. And the funniest part? She‚Äôs 22, older than me. Like, girl, this isn‚Äôt junior high. Acting this petty over donuts is ridiculous.

At this point, I was genuinely confused. Did I really commit some unspeakable crime by prioritizing my exam over a surprise donut ‚Äúparty‚Äù I never asked for?

Eventually, I apologized and explained that I‚Äôd been super stressed and my mental health was a mess. I apologized to everyone in on the celebration, not just her. But even after that, she kept acting petty.

Then one of Amelia‚Äôs friends pulled me aside and said, ‚ÄúBy the way, Amelia is still really mad at you. She had to fight to get you those donuts because her grandpa drives her to university every day, and he yelled at her for stopping to pick them up.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I realized this wasn‚Äôt even about me‚Äîshe was taking out her family frustrations on me over donuts.

When her friend told me that, I felt bad. I knew Amelia had a complicated home life, but I didn‚Äôt realize she literally got yelled at for picking up donuts for me. I felt guilty, but at the same time‚Ä¶ she could‚Äôve communicated that herself. I didn‚Äôt ask her to do this, and I definitely don‚Äôt think it justifies ignoring me, giving me attitude, and calling me ‚Äúunknown‚Äù like I‚Äôm some NPC in her life.

I gave her 3 gifts and she didn't bring me anything, not even a note, saying she's waiting for her paycheck, I wasn't upset ATM cause I know she's been having some money problems so I paid for the weekend and the gifts. The day of the anniversary (Tuesday, after the weekend), I didn't want to be the first to wish a happy anniversary, because I believed I already did enough initiation, plus I had a feeling she'd forget. she worked all day, then texted me that she went home tired, then went out to eat with her friend, and then went out for coffee with her friends, she went home at 11pm and she was off the next day, so I expected a 10 minute call from her to catch up and acknowledge the day. She didn't. She later sent a very long apology and asked for a second chance. But as it's part of a larger pattern of emotional neglect, I asked for a break until Thursday, a couple of days to cool off. I was still feeling upset and resentful, so I reached out on Sunday. We agreed to not talk about it until our next date. During the date, she avoided the subject, and when I brought it up, she did not apologize or validate my feelings, but rather blamed me for taking 4-day-break instead of 2 and complained that everyone keeps punishing her when she messes up while she lets most things go. I made a counter-argument that the 1st anniversary should be special and that the break that I took was justified, especially that it's part of a larger pattern of detachment and emotional neglect.

Having been through our own twists and turns as a team, we thought we‚Äôd share the 5 biggest slip-ups we‚Äôve noticed when people switch careers, plus some practical ways to steer clear. No lectures here‚Äîjust lessons from the road we‚Äôve travelled!

1. Thinking It‚Äôs Just a Job Hunt
A career switch isn‚Äôt about grabbing any old job‚Äîit‚Äôs about showing what you‚Äôre truly worth. If your CV still shouts ‚ÄúSales‚Äù but you‚Äôre aiming for ‚ÄúMarketing Manager‚Äù you‚Äôre off track already.

‚úîÔ∏è Fix: Rework your story‚Äîhighlight what makes you a fit for the new path, not just the old one.

2. Skipping the Coffee-Time Chats
Did you know most great roles‚Äîsay, 8 out of 10‚Äînever even hit job portals? Yet, people spend hours scrolling Naukri or LinkedIn. Big mistake.

‚úîÔ∏è Fix: Build connections. A quick chat over coffee or a WhatsApp message can open doors an application never will.

3. Expecting a Straight Road
Career switches aren‚Äôt like a train on rails‚Äîthey‚Äôre more like a rickshaw ride through a bazaar. Bumps, turns, and detours are part of it.

‚úîÔ∏è Fix: Keep your destination in sight, but don‚Äôt stress the zig-zags. Every detour teaches you something.

4. Ignoring Your Hidden Strengths
Too many think they‚Äôre starting from zero. Not true! Your skills‚Äîlike leading a team, solving problems, or convincing clients‚Äîare pure gold, no matter the field.

‚úîÔ∏è Fix: Repackage what you‚Äôve got. Show how your past wins fit your new gig‚Äîsay, turning 5 lakhs in sales into proof you can handle targets anywhere.

5. Letting ‚ÄòNo‚Äô Stop the Show
Rejections sting, but they‚Äôre not the end. We‚Äôve faced our share of ‚Äúnot now‚Äù moments‚Äîeach one just pushed us closer to a ‚Äúyes.‚Äù

‚úîÔ∏è Fix: Treat a ‚Äòno‚Äô like feedback. Tweak your approach, keep moving, and watch how fast you bounce back.

Switching careers isn‚Äôt just about a new role‚Äîit‚Äôs about setting yourself on a fresh path. Get your mindset right, and you‚Äôll be unstoppable.

I was chilling in bed when my partner started making me a coffee. He grabbed a mug and said you'll get this nice mug. I could see it from the bed cuz our flat is open space, and I said ooh it's my fav (a bright orange Moomin mug with white creatures, the first in my small collection, and none of the others are similar).

He brought it over, I sipped on it and chatted for a bit before he went to his office space in the other room. A little later I went to him and brought my mug. Then I went back to the living room, realized I forgot my mug and went back to his office to get it.

I was confused to not see mine on the desk, just two others (he sometimes has more than one). I checked the living room again before returning to the office and saying oh I guess that one's mine (the one mug that was also Moomin design). That's when I realized it's not the one he picked out for me.

He couldn't remeber the design he picked, and I couldn't really remember if it was the bright orange one when he gave it to me. He said he almost picked another one (a grey Moomin). 

Anyway, I went to check the cupboard and the bright orange one wasn't there. Most of our mugs were in the dishwasher that we ran the night before, so I checked, and there it was, in the back of the dishwasher. 

I'm certain it was the bright orange one he picked from the start, as I saw it ever so clearly and remarked on how much I love that one. 

At first I thought maybe I'm stuck in brain fog and confusing days, but the day before I remember drinking from one of his larger mugs that he prepared for me, and I prefer my Moomin mugs because of the smaller size, so it stood out in memory.

I get so stoked whenever something like this happens, so I thought I'd share this one!

Resting is what they do every year, more or less, when the smoke clears and the temperature drops, while the brine shrimp rehydrate and the playa's surface reshapes itself aided by alternating hands of day and starry night, until the days grow long like shadows at dawn, and they get that ""gotta go, gotta get up, gotta go, go, go make something happen""  feeling, akin to one that most of you without an advanced evaporative cooling system or precambrian-extract fueled generator-ac combo will recall having felt nigh every day at ten fourty-eight AM or so, BRC local time. 

Plans will be made. Money will be spent. Things will both get done and not get done, and some things that were broken will get fixed, and others upgraded beyond recognition, and others still will be studiously ignored, obscured by a murky haze of regrets.

This years release, in particular, will be notable -- in that it is slash will be different from previous years, it being a different thing altogether today than it was yesterday, than it will be tomorrow, absent some people who were there before, plus some people who weren't, and absent some structures that were there before, plus some that weren't. Same for the art, the camps, the vehicles, the belief systems, etc. 

Many things WILL happen, many of them planned, many of them unplanned, and many will say the best ones either never happened, shouldn't have happened, or definitely happened while they were (or weren't) there. 

All of these things that will (and won't) happen, will (or will not)  occur because of (and in spite of) the people, the organization, the rules, the inertia, the 10-or-so principals, the new administration, and so forth, and, when they do happen,  will do so awash in the multi-decade, vibey, dusty, and, yes, trauma-bonded gestalt of hot windy days, cool nights, art, revelry, music, and intoxication that makes Burning Man what it is.

We can each spend our time, as many have before, worrying  about the who and what, wondering about the  will they or won't they, and questioning, questioning  if next year truly was the last good year,  thereby sapping our precious bodily fluids, our joie du vivre,  our raison d'etre... 

or

we can Trust The Process, Let The Playa Provide, and gather our resources as we may, with an eye towards providing another spark or another twinkle, a ye-haw or a  bass drop, a moment of comfort, of joy, or of revelation as a gift to each other, the participants,  who, ultimately, dramatic phraseology notwithstaning,  100% make, under considerable effort,   the whole ball of (non moopy) wax *go*. 

The things that happen are what we make happen. 


In particular, to those who have plans (or concepts of a plan) to attend, and who aren't quite sure what to make of the evident Faustian juxtaposition between ""An Epic Good Time""  and ""The Resources Required to Attend Plus All The Drama Found Hearabouts"": Read your survival  guide (twice), don't buddy up with anyone who you wouldn't trust alone with you and your stuff when you're asleep, and pay no mind to the haters (they gonna hate) and naysayers (ditto). You, YOU, are a radically self reliant human being,  Goddamn it, and somebody who likely doesn't know it yet is looking forward to your company. Don't let them - or you -  down. 



Things *will* happen, and the Burn *will* be very. 

Like always. 


With love and Fck yr burn,
Barry

I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but it continued to happen every few nights. I‚Äôd wake up not panicked or stressed but 100% alert and ready to start the day. It started to become a nightly occurrence and now has not stopped for 6 weeks straight. 

I don‚Äôt wake up as alert anymore and can get back to sleep about half the time. However, it‚Äôs having a significant impact on my life and I am desperate for answers. 

I‚Äôve always had pretty good sleep hygiene but I ramped it up trying to fix this: 

- one coffee per day

- no screens first thing AM or end of day PM

- gratitude journal every night 

- exercise daily

- blackout curtains

- sleep with earplugs

- only use bedroom for sleep

- temperature stays cool (about 16-17C)

- I even tried taping my mouth shut in case I was mouth breathing

Nothing has helped.

I‚Äôve also noticed increasing brain fog, grumpiness, and memory/concentration issues lately but I don‚Äôt know if these preceded the sleep issues or not. I‚Äôve also noticed lately Im having more palpitations and I feel a bit more shortness of breath when I exert myself, but again this could just be fatigue.

Lately, I‚Äôve been waking up very warm and bit sweaty at 3am despite the room being cold and having a thin blanket. I‚Äôve also noticed that every time I wake up, I awake mid dream (often neutral or good dreams, not nightmares).

Always the backbencher, but I ranked in the top 3 in school. The top guy was on a national level‚Äîtoo good‚ÄîI admired and envied him. Went to one of India‚Äôs top engineering colleges, where I pushed boundaries, asked uncomfortable questions, and became the troublemaker. Did well in academics but messed up campus placements despite plenty of opportunities. Considered an MBA, scored 98 percentile in my third year, but it didn‚Äôt feel right. I was lost.

Started drinking heavily. Got aggressive,  always was. I was a psychopath‚Äîshort temper, violent tendencies. Spent years in the gym, built muscle, got into more fights than I can count. I‚Äôve taken more punches than I‚Äôve thrown. Had legal trouble for beating a guy outside a bar‚Äîwasn‚Äôt the first time. Probably won‚Äôt be the last.

Didn‚Äôt have much exposure to the world. My father didn‚Äôt guide me much, but my mother has been my pillar. She‚Äôs the only person I truly respect.

Started working in a low-paying job and quickly realized I was better than my peers. Lived with guys who hired call girls‚Äîtalked to them but never indulged. Didn‚Äôt sit right with me. Kept moving up, changed jobs. Eventually, I pursued a master‚Äôs degree from one of the top universities in the world. It gave me perspective, refined my skills, but didn‚Äôt change who I was at my core.

Fast forward, I now work for one of the world‚Äôs top financial institutions, in a sought-after division. The pay is good, not top-tier, but enough. The drinking problem lingered, countered by 1.5-hour workouts, four days a week. Brain fog. Antisocial, if not outright hostile.

In Mumbai, I met this Gujarati girl, call her A ,and she is someone a lot of guys will give up their right arm for. Spent a lot of time together, travelling, restaurants, pubs, call it dating if you want, I call it two friends spending time together, never even touched her, apart from the times she stretched her hand to hold mine. Her father invited me for breakfast‚ÄîI knew what that meant. But I didn‚Äôt take it further. I feel sorry for her father, he is a respectable man. I wasn‚Äôt the right guy.

Eventually, I moved into my own 2BHK, lived alone. Never had relationships, though I had opportunities‚Äîwomen wanting to visit my place for dinner. Coffee shops felt more comfortable.

Then I met her, in a different city. Gorgeous, ambitious, career-oriented, with past relationship baggage. I told her straight up‚ÄîI respect loyalty, and I‚Äôve held myself to that standard. I could have used money to buy s*x, but I didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm still the same guy. Less drinking, but the temper remains. Fistfights come too easily. I‚Äôve spent hours talking to her, and she‚Äôs beginning to see what kind of person I am. I am a psychopath. I think I love her‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve never felt before.

Question is: Am I worthy of love? Am I fit for a civilized socity? 

P.S. no DM please. Not looking for any relationships, affairs. I cannot possibly cover everything in one post. I can answer specific questions.",0,1741767193.0,AskIndianWomen,71,0.19,False
