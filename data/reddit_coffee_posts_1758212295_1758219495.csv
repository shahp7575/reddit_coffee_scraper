I mean, fictionally. There’s nothing to appreciate about the Gilded Age in the 21st century because it’s basically the same as now but with prettier clothing for the rich, I guess. And women have the right to vote. For you know, as long as we can hold on to that. Oh - modern medicine is nice. ~~Don’t look at what they’re trying to do to vaccines in the US.~~ 

I always like to start these posts with how I ended up here sharing reviews because I never set out to read an entire series in a month or take two years to finish another. This time, I am laying the blame at the feet of @napamy . She’s been on me to read more Harper St. George for over a year now, and when I said I was considering picking up *The Stranger I Wed* because [THAT COVER](https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593441008) , and she was like “oh yeah, the hero’s blonde” which if you don’t know is kinda my kryptonite. Too many tall, dark and handsome heroes in the genre, I say. Give me all the blonde ones. 

That was in early July. 

But from there I had to go back and read *The Duchess Takes a Husband* because that couple was pretty prominent in *The Stranger I Wed* and I loved them, and then @napamy had told me that *The Devil and the Heiress* had one of the best grovels (it does), and at that point I needed to know how the brother fell in love with the widow in Book 3 and then my hold for the 2025 release of *Eliza and the Duke* came through and \*breathes\* after that I wanted to reread *The Heiress Gets the Duke* to see if I enjoyed it more this time around. I wrapped that bad boy up the first week of September. 

I’m going to go in publication order for these reviews, not the chaos order of my reading, but **all of these books are interconnected and the next-book’s couple meets in the book you’re currently reading.** If you don’t read them in order, the meet-cute will be revisited in the couple’s actual book, but it’ll be from a different POV - why not get both character’s thoughts on their first meeting? Just trust me - read them in order.



***The Gilded Age Heiresses Series:*** 

[The Heiress Gets a Duke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53283742-the-heiress-gets-a-duke)

**Reread Rating: 4 Stars**

**Original Rating: 2.5 Stars**



St. George opens her series with *“a feminine wail”* at the engagement party of an unwilling American heiress who has been essentially auctioned off to the highest-titled English Peer that would take her, and I think it’s a brilliant way to set the tone.

August Crenshaw, American Heiress and Bluestocking saw one of her best friends married off to an English Peer and for some reason thought her parents wouldn’t do the same. Six months later, the trip to London to see said friend - now a Duchess, albeit a miserable one - turns out to be a matchmaking endeavor for August’s little sister, but if an English Peer wants August, her parents will welcome that marriage as well.

Before we go any further, you need to understand how much I hate the Crenshaw parents. Congrats to St. George for writing these two on the level of Dolores Umbridge for me because I haven’t hated a fictional character like this in *awhile*. My hatred will be present in every review from the series because THEY ARE THE WORST!!!! Yes, their actions are why their children are in England and why we get to read their Romances - I👏DON’T👏CARE👏!!!

Enter Evan, the newest Duke of Rothschild. Saying he’s impoverished is putting it kindly. He inherited multiple crumbling estates, empty coffers, failing tenant farms, and a heavy weight upon his shoulders (very shapely) to fix it. Evan doesn’t want a wife, let alone a wife in the next four weeks, but it would be stupid of him to turn down the Crenshaw’s matchmaking attempts when the marriage settlement would more than cover the title’s debts. 

Before the Crenshaws were offering their daughters up on a platter, Evan was making ends meet by prize-fighting. It is at his most recent fight that August was in attendance, and they shared an anonymous and reckless kiss for luck. When Evan formally meets the Crenshaws soon after in hopes of a betrothal contract, both he and August are surprised. But it’s August that is more surprised when Evan says he wants to court her, not Violet.

What follows is really just a sweet, albeit quick, developing romance between two people who are forced together due to circumstances but come to find how well they suit. August is fiery and against the marriage suit from the get-go, but Evan loves her stubbornness and sense of self. August comes to learn that Evan has only done the best he could with the mess he inherited, and that <i>yes</i> he does need her family’s money, but he also has come to need her just as much in his life. 

The third-act conflict is presented three chapters from the end of the book, and the first time I read this I was enraged at the last-minute conflict and rapid resolution to the point I was put off reading St. George for a year. This time through, I still felt the ending was a bit rushed, but I also knew from reading other books in the series that that’s just what St. George does. I do think this conflict/ending is more rushed than any of the others, and I do think it’s quiet Over The Top, but it didn’t take away from my enjoyment of the rest of the book. 



[The Devil and the Heiress](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55655073-the-devil-and-the-heiress)**: 4 Stars** 

Violet Crenshaw, the heroine and American heiress, is more naive than her elder and now married sister, August, but I didn’t think she was too stupid to live - she just wanted to escape the marriage and life her parents had sat out before her, and so she took Lord Leigh at his word. Despite having no real reason to believe him. Nor disbelieve him, to be fair.

I was partial to Christian, Lord Leigh, because that man was Kaz Brekker coded and I am a simple woman. (He’s got a limp, a fancy cane, he can fight, his dark hair is always slicked back, and he’s goT a cold demeanor I repeat: I AM A SIMPLE WOMAN). He also did offer for Violet’s hand before scheming to help her run away while hoping he can convince her to marry him in the end. And that is manipulative, but this is also fiction, so. Actually, I was told that this book has one of the best grovels, and while correct in terms of the third-act (I just love a man doing political machinations as part of the grovel I EAT THAT SHIT UP), but Christian regrets his part in Violet’s running away pretty early into their cross-country sojourn and spends half the book low-key groveling because of it. I don’t call this man-pain delicious lightly.

But because Violet and Christian did run away (and fall in love) though, Violet is super compromised and also suddenly understands the consequences of her actions while cranking up her naivete because how could she fall right into his evil plans!!! This characterization felt out of left field, but DRAMA and it leads to their rushed wedding and strained marriage in the last fourth of the book until Violet forgives Christian and then the book is done. I stg, the second that conflict is resolved it’s THE END when it’s a book by St. George and while I didn’t mind it so much here, it’s clearly been an issue for me before.

Some other notes:

\- The Crenshaw parents are the fucking worst I have read in awhile and deserve Gilded Age prison for not only their superior wealth but how they use their daughters as bargaining chips with the English aristocracy. I know it’s the whole plot of the series - American heiress being sold off for titles/respectability - but man did St. George do a great job making these two awful.

\- There’s a bonus chapter for the book on the author’s website for newsletter subscribers

\-I think this could be 5 stars upon reread, but I read this while on vacation so I wasn’t reading it at my normal pace and by the end I was like “will I ever be free” despite enjoying it! 



[The Lady Tempts an Heir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58214321-the-lady-tempts-an-heir)**: 5 Stars**

Idk why Maxwell Crenshaw nor I thought his parents wouldn’t be awful about him still being unattached or about them threatening to tear his sister’s project away from the family company, BUT the subversion of the heiress for sale here being the actual first-born son was 👌🏻. Feminism means equality, Max! You can be sold off just as well as your sisters! Because your parents SUCK! (Can you tell I hate them because my god I hate them)

Helena was widowed young, and has no want for a husband, but her charities are failing because Society doesn’t think young unwed mothers should have assistance and how dare a ~~widowed~~ single young Lady besmirch her own reputation by trying to aid them. But if she had a man in her life to guide her…

Since these two have a smidge of a past from when they had to go ‘rescue’ Violet from the Earl of Leigh in Book 2, and there was a spark then..

Yes, this is a fake engagement book. Yes, those are dime a dozen in Romance - and again I👏🏻 DON’T👏🏻 CARE👏🏻. When both these idiots are insistent nothing can come of their mutual attraction or agreement, but oh no! There’s a dramatic declaration of feelings before Max has to head back to New York unexpectedly AND THEN there’s desperate communication via telegram - I never thought telegrams could be romantic but St. George PROVED MY WRONG! (Also, there’s a whole bonus chapter of MORE letters and telegrams on Harper St. George’s website for newsletter subscribers just saaaaaaying)

I also really enjoyed that Helena was infertile and it wasn’t fixed by another man’s penis, as many a Romance that touches on the topic like to do. I don’t want to say it was ‘brave’ of St. George to have Helena remain infertile, but it was a choice that gave the third-act conflict more depth, and it was handled respectfully and realistically.

There was an attempt to redeem the Crenshaw parents in the epilogue which, okay Harper if you must but it didn’t work for me and they’re still evil cartoon villains. I say this with my full chest: I hate them. When Daddy Crenshaw had a heart attack the first time, I gave a little gasp, but it couldn't happen to a nicer character. Then he apparently had another and I was like ""only the good die young, huh.""

  


[The Duchess Takes a Husband](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59681960-the-duchess-takes-a-husband)**: 5 Stars**

The premise here is simple: Camille’s a widow has never had good sex and Jacob needs some investors to think he’s engaged, and they come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the fake fiancée bit takes all of 2.5 seconds and Jacob becomes very invested in Camille finding pleasure and happiness, in and out of bed.

I’m not one for “lessons in sexual pleasure” plots because I think they are a too-easy road for sex scenes and lack the development emotionally between the MCs, but St. George spent *so* much time on Camille finding pleasure everywhere in her life which made the few sex lessons shine. They were also written very, *very* well. I think one of St. George’s strengths is her ability to write sex scenes.

Jacob was one of those “Love is not for me” heroes who then is so deeply in love before he realizes it. There was the five seconds where he tried to deny their connection, but St. George loves a dramatic third-act event to wake the hero up, and it did so here.

I have nothing to say about Camille other than that she deserves the world, and I'm glad she found a man who agrees.

  


  
***The Doves of New York Series:***

[The Stranger I Wed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194803825-the-stranger-i-wed)**: 4 Stars**

Cora Dove is the eldest of the Dove Sisters, bastard children of Charles Hathaway who is from the upper crust of Gilded Age New York society. When his mother died, it’s revealed that she had an ounce of guilt about how the Doves had been treated, and left them large inheritances that Daddy Hathaway decided to lock away behind the stipulation that the three women must marry men he deems acceptable. Which happened to all be in England. With titles.

Harper St. George looooves a shitty parent, and I love to hate the ones she gives me. 

So, it’s off to England for Cora, her sisters, and their well-meaning but slightly crass mother where Camille, the heroine from the last book, will introduce them into society. 

First of all - when both of the MCs love languages is Acts of Service.

Second of all - this couple's meet cute is them literally running into each other on the football pitch and crashing to the ground. That was the moment I knew I was in for a good time.

Sure, Leo and Cora have to properly meet at a ball a few days later. And yeah, she has the funds to fix his crumbling estate and he has the title to raise her social standing so it’s all very basic Marriage of Convenience. But what I really loved was how these two approached the marriage as an actual agreement and even though they didn’t know each other, it was clear that they respected the other enough to be honest…about most things. (There still had to be a plot, after all.) When that mutual respect carried on into their marriage and burgeoning friendship to mutual attraction? Delicious.

I agree with other reviewers that the last 10% really picked up the pacing and felt like a mad-dash to the end, but it didn’t take away from my enjoyment of watching Leo and Cora fall for one another.

  
[Eliza and the Duke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219520711-eliza-and-the-duke)**: 2.5 Stars**

I originally dnf’ed this book at the 30% mark, and I sincerely wish I had left it to rot, but then we wouldn’t be here and I wouldn’t be able to steer you away from this book. Which I am. 

When one reads an author’s body of work in a little over two months, one can indeed point out their writing quirks. St. George loves: fantastic sex scenes, third-act conflicts wrapping up too quickly, and second book heroines that are much more naive than their older sister and the heroine of the previous book. 

The book opens with Eliza, this book’s heroine, trying to sneak into the Montague Club (this club is in ALL of the previous books so it makes sense she’s there but it’s very much a iykyk situation) from the backrooms where she sees a young man dressed in all black (me: oh?) covered in blood (me, again, thinking about Kaz Brekker: ooooooh?), and decides to follow him instead of getting the hell out there (me, no longer excited: oh). After helping the man, seeing some of the back of the club, and then coming to her senses, all Eliza knows is that he goes by the name The Duke, is bleeding because of prize fighting, and that she is fascinated by him.

As luck would have it, The Duke, aka Simon, not only works for the Montague Club but because of Third-Act Plot Reasons in the previous book, he has been tasked with providing security for the Dove sisters and their mother until Eliza’s brother-in-law deems it unnecessary. While this is all well and good and honestly a bit expected in Romance, it’s the way that Eliza’s entire purpose in life turns away from anything that isn’t Getting Time Alone With Simon. Simon, who does find Eliza very pretty and intriguing, but is just trying to do his job. 

I really liked Simon as a main character. This man was orphaned as a baby in Whitechapel, watched his sister die after childbirth, escaped the gang he had been working for, and keeps paying the ransom the gang leader, Brody, ‘requires’ to keep his niece safe. He is doing His Best and now he’s got an heiress demanding that he take her to Whitechapel or she’ll reveal that he’s fighting for previously mentioned gang leader in an effort to pay down said ransom/debt. Of the two MCs, Simon is clearly more developed, more complex, and someone I could root for. So it’s too bad that he gives into Eliza’s demands and takes her to Whitechapel for “one night of freedom.”

I’ll get back to this “one night of freedom” in the next paragraph, but Eliza as a character needs to be examined on its own. By the end of the last book, she had secured a betrothal from a titled peer (Earl, maybe? IDC enough to look it up) that she didn’t care about BUT she wanted her inheritance. Said Peer goes off to tour the content and so their betrothal is on hold while he’s away, but that gives Eliza time to properly examine the speed in which she had been sold to this stranger and so it makes sense that she wants one night for herself and to see a different part of London than she would ever again. But it’s how she goes about it, and the choice St. George makes to interweave this want with her attraction to Simon, that throws the (somewhat) rational adventure idea into pure stupidity. There is also a rashness to Eliza’s decisions from the moment she saw Simon bleeding in a back hallway that lack all common sense and throw the idea that Eliza was a logical young woman who grew up on just enough and who sought to attend college ut the window. It’s like the second she saw Simon, she became like the pampered heiresses she claims to have nothing in common with. 

Eliza, if that was true you would LEAVE THE HELP ALONE. I’m not saying be a demon who treats him like he’s beneath you, but let people do their jobs without sexually harassing them!! 

Okay. So this “one night of freedom” occurs and throughout the course of this adventure, a run in with Simon’s former gang, and a heart to heart at a coffee house, both of these fools believe themselves to be in love with the other. Here is also where you learn that Eliza is 19 and Simon is maaaaybe 23 (remember - orphaned as a baby) and the impulsivity of their actions make so much sense. Of course you think you love each other - your hormones are raging.

I understand that this is a Romance, and as a Romance Reader, I should want these two to live HEA etc., etc., but I didn’t. I don’t. And the remaining half of the book is full of more irrational choices and immature behavior including following the other London in a hansom cab, attempting to throw a fight to escape a gang leader, running away to Scotland but not for marriage purposes, a betrothal/rescue plan from the last Dove Sister (the heroine of Book 3), a murder plot, and love declarations. 

By the end of this book, I was flabbergasted. I can see the potential here - sincerely. But I have no idea how this plot with this lack of depth made it all the way to publication when nothing else from St. George via Berkley has been like this. And this isn’t a case of me thinking a book is going to be X when it’s really Y - I went in with no idea of what to expect other than the brief mention of Eliza refusing to marry the Peer which was mentioned at the end of Book 1. 

That .5 of a star is for the set-up of Book 3 which had me biting at the bars of my cage like that cat meme on most celebrity photoshoots. You know the one.

But the entire book was not worth reading for those few pages. 

  


**Final Thoughts**:

After ending my reviews on a rant, there is a bit more I have to say. 

I should start by saying that I don’t hold *Eliza and the Duke* against St. George, but I can hold the quality of 2025 HRs that major publishers have been releasing up to previous years and find them lacking. We all know tradpub is moving away from HR, and St George shared that she was one of the authors that wasn’t offered another contract *despite* her releases earning out and her earning royalties. This is a much larger topic, and one I know R/Romancelandia has discussed multiple times, so I have nothing to add to it here. But I can still boo Berkley for cutting St. George free. (I believe her last book under contract is Book 3 of The Doves of New York but I also have not been able to confirm that other than on Goodreads.)

I found the Dollar Princesses/American heiresses to be an area in HR that is woefully underrepresented (you should see my desperate searches for more once I finished all these), and as such St. George was able to tell pretty standard stories but with new breath in them. I also appreciated that her FMCs were not 21st Century women thrown into the past, but were strong in their own right and historical time but had feminist tendencies/opinions. Her MMCs were all ass over tits in their own ways for their heroines and really, that’s what I want to read. They’re supportive, fairly progressive in their views, whether before or after meeting/loving the Heroine, and had struggles of their own besides needing $$$ from the dowries.

St. George does have a few Harlequin series for those interested - one with Old West Outlaws (this one is not on GR as a series, so [here’s a link to the first one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28688473-the-innocent-and-the-outlaw?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=zuEDTC3XWG&rank=1)), another with [Vikings](https://www.goodreads.com/series/163887-viking-warriors), and an[ Old West series on KU](https://www.goodreads.com/series/183676-outlaws-of-the-wild-west)  she got the rights back to and has been polishing up, and a few one-off Viking romances. I have not had luck with the ones I’ve tried, but I wanted to make mention for those who enjoy a Harlequin (it’s generally not me, no matter the author). She also has [a CR series with boxer heroes she co-wrote](https://www.goodreads.com/series/196174-blood-and-glory) which I haven’t even looked into, but we’ll see how desperate I get for more of her work!!

Lastly, when I reached out to St. George to tell her how much I enjoyed her books (email your favorite authors! They love it!) and ask for recommendations, she suggested Johanna Shupe for more Gilded Age Romance, Adrienne Herrera for something outside of the norm in HR, and Mimi Matthews. 

And that’s a wrap on this IRAO! If you’ve read any of Harper St. George’s work, I would love to know if you have a favorite or if you know of any authors similar to her! ",2,1758219335.0,romancelandia,0,1.0,False

Back story...

I (35f) have 2 kids, legally married although 18 months separated, I have 2 houses, one I live in and one I rent out. I earn close to 6 figures, no debt, credit score 1000, life is good, I work hard, I am financially literate (I budget and live within my means) and consider myself a great decision maker. 

Him (45m) legally married although 4 years separated, 2 kids that don't live with him and has rare contact. He is a poor money manager, he has an IVA, he burns money on shit as fast as he gets it - I tried helping him get straight with his finances once and he was spending £600 a month between Costa coffee and his corner shop 😬 (cigarettes and junk food). 

Mine and his connection is 10/10 when we're in each others company, but when Im away from him and think with my brain, and look at this on paper, I'm like, nahhhh. 

He suggested once I sell my house (the one I live in, my family home) and that me and him rent somewhere (he can't meet me half way financially buying a house). I couldn't work out why that would be a viable suggestion, until he said he wouldn't feel right living in my STBXH shadow, in my house, which I understand. I need to stay in this house due to kids school and the fact I've spent £150k on it in 3 years having it extended. 

He doesnt have a crumb of savings, like I said, he has an IVA (bankruptcy) for another 3 years, but he does earn well, probably just more than me, but is poor with his money management and this is a real put off for me. I suspect he has a history of gambling and cocaine addiction, possible call-girls too, it's just a hunch I get. He always told a story about 'his old friend' who had all of those addictions, yet my gut told me he was referring to his former self. 

There has been some displaced violence along the way after nights out. Where he drinks too much and gets angry about things going on in his life. Victim complex. 

My heart runs to him, but my head is like GTFO. NOW.

I’d roll out of bed groggy, chug down my coffee, and rush out the door—already behind before the day even began. By the time I hit my desk, I’d be wide awake from the caffeine, but within an hour or two, the crash hit. And with it came cravings, sluggishness, and that constant little voice reminding me I hadn’t made any real progress on my weight in years.

I tried the usual fixes—switching to green tea, cutting sugar, even skipping breakfast altogether. Each attempt lasted maybe a week before I slipped back into old habits. Deep down, I knew my metabolism just wasn’t working the way it used to, and the older I got, the harder it seemed to get back on track.

[Then, one morning, while scrolling through my phone before work, I came across something interesting—a tasteless powder you could stir right into your coffee called Java Burn. It claimed to work with your body, not against it, boosting metabolism without changing your entire routine. I figured, “Well, I’m drinking coffee anyway—why not?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1l1je89/comment/mvldioz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The first week, I didn’t notice much beyond feeling a little more steady through the mornings. But by the second week, I realized I wasn’t hitting that mid-morning slump as hard. My energy felt cleaner, less jittery, and my focus at work actually stuck around past lunch. The real surprise came a few weeks later when my jeans started fitting looser—not because I was dieting hardcore, but because my body finally felt like it was working with me instead of against me.

The best part wasn’t just the physical change—it was the freedom. I stopped obsessing over complicated meal plans and 5 a.m. workout routines I could never stick with. Instead, I had this simple morning habit that didn’t disrupt my life, but supported it.

Now, mornings don’t feel like a race anymore. I sip my coffee, start my day, and feel in control—steady, energized, and confident that I’m finally moving in the right direction. Sometimes, the smallest shifts really do create the biggest changes.",1,1758219096.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

My husband didn’t want to come. “I’ll hang back, game a little, order pizza,” he said. He’s 41. I thought, “Fine, he’s an adult, he’ll be fine.”

He was not fine.

Day 2, he decided he was going to become a “grill master” even though we don’t own a grill. He stacked three baking sheets on top of each other, poured lighter fluid over them, and set off the smoke alarm for 40 minutes. The oven still smells like gasoline.

Then, he got really into “minimalist living” after a TikTok binge and threw away half our dishes, claiming “we only need one bowl each.” Unfortunately, he chose the salad bowl and the dog’s water dish. Everything else? Gone.

To feed himself, he bulk-ordered 20 frozen burritos and survived on those exclusively. By week two, he was eating them still partially frozen because “it’s basically a cold wrap.” His justification: “saves electricity.”

He stopped doing laundry entirely. Just rotated between two pairs of basketball shorts. By the time I got back, they had fused into what I can only describe as “denim-adjacent cardboard.” The dog started growling every time he sat down.

Last night, I walked in to find him shirtless, playing the recorder he ordered off Amazon because “Mozart slapped.” The living room smelled like burnt plastic and ranch dressing.

This morning, I woke up to him mumbling in his sleep: “I am the burrito.” The dog has relocated to the bathtub and won’t come out.

So now I’m sitting in a café, sipping coffee like it’s communion wine, with a dog who looks like he’s seen combat. The barista asked if I wanted almond milk. I just said no. My house is already nut-based chaos.

My fiancé is a wonderful man who works very hard to provide for us. He is also the life of the party, and has a group of close friends and family.

Over the Christmas and New Year Period, he would like a group of about 12 of us (a mixture of his family and friends) to go on a really nice vacation to celebrate the holiday season, for about 15 days.

My reservations are as follows:
1. I am extremely introverted, and sharing a chalet for 15 days with 12 people might be too much for me. For context, we will be in a tiny village, not somewhere I could escape to a coffee shop, mall etc. 
2. I only have 8 days of vacation left at work, so if I go, I would be spending all of those days on that trip with his family and friends.
3. (And this is the biggest but possibly the most bitter reservation I have) - as I mentioned, he works a lot to give us a great life. A part of that is that we don’t get to spend much quality time together. I am feeling a bit resentful of the fact that he is taking 15 days for this vacation with his family and friends when he told me multiple times throughout the year that he cannot take any time off work for small holidays or plans that I wanted to make for just the two of us. 
4. We took the same vacation last year, over the holiday period with just his friends over a shorter period of time, and whilst it was nice, when I mentioned to him this year that I would like for us to make more time to go on holiday together, he mentioned that we already took a really nice one together (referencing the trip where we got not 1 moment together alone as we were with his friends). 

Sorry, I know this is a real first world problem, but I’m looking for advice. 

P.S we are not the type of couple that thinks we need to do everything together. I’m more than happy for him to go without me. I would never say to him that because I don’t want to do something, he cannot, and vice versa. ",2,1758218711.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

I’m leading a team that is building a next-generation dating & social connection platform that goes beyond the traditional swipe-and-chat model. Instead of users wasting time swiping or small-talking endlessly, our platform uses an AI-powered agent that acts as a personal matchmaker and date planner.

Users interact with their AI agent (via WhatsApp or app) about what they want (a coffee meetup, a walk, or even just someone to study/work with).

The AI matches them instantly with someone looking for the same experience.

If both agree, the AI handles the entire date planning process — venue suggestions, reservations, etc.

Unlike other apps, this works for friendships, networking, and companionship too, not just romance.


We already have the team and infrastructure setup. What we’re looking for now is an early-stage investor/partner who can help us move from MVP to launch and scale faster.

The global dating market is worth $10B+ annually, and there’s a huge dissatisfaction with existing apps (swipe fatigue, superficial matches, low conversion to real meetups). Our model directly solves this.

If you’re an investor or know someone who’d be interested, feel free to DM me. I’ll be happy to share the detailed proposal privately.

Thanks!

My self-control has been pretty bad over the last few months. A few too many night outs with the family, and friends plus a good friend of mine was staying over and he knows how to cook!

But much to my surprise, my A1C actually went down. Not a lot, but from 6.6 mmol/l (May) to 6.5 mmol/l  (September).

They didn't check cholesterol, or ferratin (I don't eat a lot of meat so take supplements) this time.

But looking at the history of my results, I'm glad where the numbers are going.

Going to try hard to get that 6.5 mmol/l to at or below 6.0 for my next A1C (which is freaking hard when you live in a house where nobody is diabetic and can enjoy carbs galore).

EDIT:

I would also say that intermittent fasting is probably the one strategy that has helped me significantly in keeping my A1C and daily numbers low.

I IF 16:8 and often stretches longer as I just get busy.

I try and hydrate as much as I can, and usually start the day with black coffee (flavored) or green tea and try and drink at least 2l - 3l of water daily (not hitting that mark recently).

It was a tense environment. For context she does have an neurological illness but boy is she mean, hits me, abuses me and is always strict. Yet I feel ashamed in the mornings when I wake up I want to hug her or just give her a kiss. She is very nice when she wants but is often asking me for help, goes by my past reputation of being a troubleosme child/not helping her in the house.

I have said hateful things to her man, she has also wished me dead. My father is not in town and I have even had horrible exchange of words with him that he does not stick up to her and preaches being honest but is never fully honest. My elder brother is abroad and has been or 10 years. He has not been around much and I am extremely pissed off with him. He acts like a total prick. He always wants to advise, plays a mediator role, has a lush life and I used to say I love him the most. He tells me to get a job (It has been fucking hard searching for over a year and no luck UK market is fucked and back home too) and move out like thats what I am doing it is not easy.

Anyway I was so rutheless today man my mom as crying and I was not falling for it. All my life she has been rude mean controlling be it her illness or not and I have always had to be with her except during my time at uni. There is no ""home"" for me going to my parents place or whatever it is a battlefield. You might find this even more weird but I do softly care and I miss them when I am away in another twonw here I am currently based but somehow I visted and yeah less then 6 hours and the fucking fight beguns. She scolded me for putting too much sugar in coffee or clothes lying around in the room for 2 mini this can wait if I am comfortable and eating. I hate to say this but my mom is like a karen and everything feels fake. My dad and my brother except the financial support are not helpful. I am my own rolemodel. I write down my thougths and I work out hard. I have less friends but I stay in touch and I am angryw ith the world. How can my mom hit my arm and scold always. I gave it off to her, said F off and said she should apologise also. I was rutheless. I need help too. I do also want her nice side and my support and she always complains to my dad who tells me off!! That is not fair nobody listens tot he full story.

Just to le tyou know int he gym, with people, I am kind, sweet, respectful but I cant crack my own familyu who dont respect me or love me so much. (they think I am fake or act this way but I do not and i just acyt hwo tehy actw ith me then they are all offended) I get I need a job, I am trying but they dont udnerstandits diffuclt,. nwo I am egtting in touch and tyring i think i will close somehting soon. I want to be a gentleman. Never raise my voice or even phsycially stand ins omeones space how cani lose my cool so much today. This is pent up after years and I still feel liek... fighting. I want to be calma nd comfortable everytime I try this problem re arises. I dont want to be weak or be be ullied by family and the world. Fake friends. people from school. (well i am in my early 2os and still think about it) injuries in football, never getting credit too. And yeah, I can complaint today man.

I was kicked out of college a couple of years ago and managed to get back into college but eventually dropped out. I always felt like there was a cap on how far I could use the information they were teaching me and that I was being pushed down a path that wasn't meant for me.

When I dropped out 4 months ago I decided to start self-learning AI and how it can be monetised because I realised that the people who are competent in AI will be the future of the economy. Here are the two things that have helped me finally be on my feet independently and become an entrepreneur.

**AI Influencers & AI Voice Agents** are the two things that have been successful for me - I also tried developing mobile apps with **Cursor** and making AI music with **Suno** but those didn't work.

**AI Voice Agents**: I set them up with **GoHighLevel** and it was very easy to setup. I then called local construction & maintenance businesses that were on the job 24/7 that missed calls from potential clients - I found that the mobile numbers for these businesses on google almost always were the business owners phone number which made it easy to setup a Zoom call with them and show them the software. This is not very good for people who aren't great at cold calling and managing systems but if you are good at sales this is perfect for you. I charge $200 a month for the maintenance and $500 for the setup fee.

**AI Influencers**: This was a wildcard for me and I didn't think it would work - I have always been fascinated by Influencers and the attention economy that we live in. I knew that if you lived in a certain city or had a certain lifestyle, looked attractive and posted 24/7 you would go viral but that's the opposite of me as I would rather stay off social media so I never tried it.

So I found a video of someone using **AuraForCreators** to make photos that look like real people to build a following online and then use that following to do brand deals and UGC. I used **Kling AI** to make those photos become videos. I tried it and it worked - after posting reels on Instagram using the trial reels feature - my influencer Charlie started to go viral (After posting everyday for 2 weeks she had 14,000 followers & 2 million impressions).

I had management agencies reaching out to manage her - record labels and musicians reaching out to promote music on her story and more. I charge $400 to promote music and for brand deals (clothing brands, supplements, coffee shops) I tailor it based on the company marketing budget.

**And that's it** \- thought I would share my process and see what you all think. Is this all moral? Is AI going to take our jobs? what do you all think.

Thanks

They said just needed fuel additives and gave it back to me August 6th.

On the morning of August 9, 2025, after driving an hour 20 minutes to Connecticut, thinking the vehicle was okay, the car once again failed to start after driving and parking in a whole foods parking lot. I got it back to dealer where they said there were fuel rail pressure codes so they replaced the hpfp then the electrical harness. Thankfully the issue presented to a tech a again, it noted that first it was a fuel pressure issue and replaced the high pressure fuel pump then the issue presented again and they replaced the engine harness. 

Thinking that was the end of my issues, on August 27, 2025 – I picked up the R from dealer at approximately 1:30 p.m. Within 20 minutes of driving and then parking to get a cup of coffee, the exact same defect reoccurred — the car would not start. After two more weeks and the replacement of the lpfp i have now had the car back for a week and just domt trust the car. Initiated a buyback request but nothing from VW in a month.

1nkfab5,https://i.redd.it/68stelopoypf1.jpeg,Almost scammed in Golden cafe Kolkata!,"Its true guys! I almost got scammed today.
I matched with this 23F girl and she asked straightaway to meet, I was aware of some scam thing due to the screenshot posted but didn’t know I was so close to it.
So she met me near Dhakuria and I was on a bike so I told her to sit and let’s go to some good cafe, but she told there are really good cafés here too, she made me park my bike and took me to Golden cafe. She told if I don’t like we can go somewhere else.
I started feeling odd when she entered inside and opened the door then went directly to lift as if she knew the place really well. She replied “No it’s my first time here but I enquired if it is open before meeting you that’s why I chose this”
Now she didn’t ask any one about which floor and took me inside the bar.
Rather than a cafe it was a low key bar with no customers on any table, but waiters were 7-8, time was around 4 PM.
Then she started asking me to tell my hobbies and all, but my Sherlock brain helped me and I told her I didn’t get good vibe there, we mutually agreed to go out then.
After that she was pissed off, I asked to go somewhere else to which she said either this one or nothing, to which I replied “Let’s ditch it then”
Thought I was also acting crazy but truly it was a scam and I got saved today. Beware folks!
Also, 
1. I asked her to go to idli express to which she said she doesn’t eat idli, I asked to take coffee but she kept insisting on going to “golden cafe and lounge”
2. She denied to go much far from this cafe as she told her parents lived nearby
3. Before I ditched the date she called someone and told that ‘Nahi hua’ ",3,1758217970.0,kolkata,3,1.0,False

1nkf8ah,https://i.redd.it/m8w1gnaboypf1.jpeg,Round 2: Swoon and Creamy Creations run back,"Alright after all the feedback I got from my first round of reviews, I am back with a second based on a lot of the commentary. 

    1. Honey Sopapilla
        1. This was one of my favorites from this batch of sampling. I love Cinnamon, and I think it provides a good background here with the bits of sopapilla (not as soft as the cookie pieces that are added in to most of the ice creams), and then the swirls of honey mix nicely with that spiced ice cream

    2. Que Gloria
        1. I wanted more pecan out of this, caramel ice cream base AND swirls made this out of balance. 

    3. Grasshopper
        1. Minty ice cream with Oreo cookies. I would take mint chip over this because the cookie texture is lost and soft with the ice cream. I wanted more of a crunch.

    4. Pumpkin Cheesecake
        1. I liked the cheesecake bites and the pumpkin flavor throughout, it is definitely on the sweeter side compared to the CC Pumpkin Pie ice cream. The graham cracker swirl gets lost in it all, would be better with actual crusty bites. This would make for a good Affogato in the Fall.

    5. Pumpkin Pie
        1. Instead of cheesecake bites, you’re getting swirls of whipped cream with graham cracker crust bites. This flavor is not as sweet as the cheesecake counterpart, and does not taste as heavy. There was an aftertaste though, not sure if maybe they went too heavy with the spices on this one

    6. Caramel Apple a la mode
        1. This was a fun one! You really do get it all in one pint - the cinnamon apples, pie pieces, caramel swirls and then a brown sugar ice cream. I initially had the Pumpkin cheesecake as my favorite of these 3 seasonal flavors, but this one has grown on me more

    7. Cherry Pistachio
        1. Wow, probably my favorite of this bunch. The chunks of cherry throughout are awesome, no holding back. And the candied pistachios probably lost some of their texture, but still I love pistachio and how its earthy flavor plays with the sweet/tart of cherry. This might be my new favorite Swoon.

    8. Astros Peanut Brittle
        1. Truly, a home run flavor that I don’t think anyone can deny. Add some chocolate to it, and you’ve basically got a Snickers bar ice cream. I found this half emptied carton before I could even start the reviews as my wife snuck into it

    9. Red Velvet Cheesecake
        1. Not my favorite Swoon or cheesecake ice cream. It’s ok, the color is there for eye appeal but I think the Strawberry Cheesecake is better. 

    10. Granny’s Oatmeal Crumble
        1. So glad people recommended this one! I hope they keep it through Fall because it is oatmeal cream pie ice cream. The chunks of oatmeal are so good, their texture holds up to give a nice contrast. The ice cream has those warm spice flavors and then the white fudge swirls blend smoothly for a delicious bite

My Top 4 were Granny’s Oatmeal, Honey Sopapilla, Cherry Pistachio, and Pumpkin Cheesecake, although that Caramel Apple might be making a move

Thanks again for everyone’s input and recommendations, this has been fun! For Round 3, I am already looking at the Swoon Coffee, and Mexican Hot Chocolate, what else do you think?

Testing this sleek black machine has made me rethink the coffee shop runs I used to religiously make. From its modern design to its performance, I've been exploring every nook and button over the past few weeks to see whether it lives up to its hype.

**Design and Build Quality**

Aesthetics often matter more than we'd like to admit, and this coffee maker doesn’t disappoint. Its sleek, compact form is perfect for slotting into my kitchen counter setup. With dimensions of 6 inches deep, 17 inches wide, and 13 inches in height, it feels unobtrusive but substantial. What particularly stood out to me is its extra-large 60-ounce removable water tank, which can be repositioned to adapt to the counter layout. The motorized brew head adds a high-tech touch, making it feel premium. It’s the kind of appliance that visitors notice and ask about.  

[Check Nespresso BNV420BLK1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b01n5s8tv1/)

**Ease of Use and Operation**

The first thing I noticed while setting it up was just how user-friendly this machine is. It’s fully automatic, featuring programmable settings and a straightforward button interface. Mornings are smoother because it only takes 25 seconds to heat up, an absolute godsend for someone who's perpetually rushing. The automatic shut-off feature adds a layer of safety, especially for those of us who tend to be forgetful before caffeine kicks in.

**Centrifusion Technology: A Coffee Lover’s Delight**

Centrifusion technology is at the heart of what this coffee maker does, and I can confidently say it works wonders. The capsule spins at up to 7,000 rotations per minute to effortlessly blend ground coffee and water, resulting in a rich, creamy crema. It’s oddly satisfying watching it work while the smell of freshly brewed coffee fills up the space. The machine also uses barcode reading to determine the perfect brewing parameters for each coffee capsule. While this is convenient, I do wish there was an option to tweak variables manually for the control freaks (like me) who enjoy experimenting.

**Versatility**

The versatility of this machine was a pleasant surprise. It supports four cup sizes—5oz, 8oz, single espresso, and double espresso—all at the touch of a button. Whether I crave a bold hot brew or a mild iced coffee, it has me covered. Straight espresso shots are delectable, and pouring them over ice with some milk has essentially replaced fancy coffee shop lattes. However, I do recommend using Nespresso’s capsules for optimal results. Generic pods sometimes don’t produce the same richness, and the barcode tech doesn't always recognize them perfectly.

**Key Benefits**

- Stylish, compact design with a repositionable water tank  
- Exceptionally easy to use with an automatic system  
- Energy-efficient heat-up in just 25 seconds  
- Centrifusion technology delivers premium results  
- Compatible with a versatile range of cup sizes  

**Hurdles**

As much as I’ve enjoyed the convenience and results, there are a couple of things to consider:  

- Capsule-specific brewing means you’re mostly locked into using Nespresso pods, which can add up in cost.  
- Not ideal for purists who want manual customization of brew settings.  
- The used capsules’ container fills up faster than expected, requiring frequent emptying.  

**Other Options**

Having owned other single-serve coffee machines in the past, I naturally found myself comparing this model to rivals like the Keurig K-Cafe or the Breville Bambino Plus. The competitor machines shine in their respective niches. For instance, Keurig offers a larger selection of cheaper coffee pods, while the Breville Bambino Plus gives you excellent manual control for crafting a more personalized espresso experience. However, neither matches the VertuoPlus’s Centrifusion technology, which creates that gorgeous crema so effortlessly. On the flip side, Keurig machines are generally more affordable and easier to maintain, while Breville enthusiasts appreciate the traditional artistry of manual espresso making.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Single-serve coffee makers often come under scrutiny for being pricey in terms of both initial purchase and ongoing pod usage. While this machine isn’t the cheapest option out there, I’d argue it offers tremendous value for the quality of coffee and espresso it delivers. If you’re someone who frequents coffee chains multiple times a week, consider this an investment—you might actually save money in the long run while enjoying comparable or better quality coffee at home.

In short, I have a 10x16 office shed that I want to install a 12k BTU , 230v split unit to. I'm not hung up on the exact model yet, but assume it's the one below. Will also run a fan, two laptops, 2 external monitors, coffee pot, and 2 lights. It's an office shed I want to keep cool in the summer and warm in the winter while the wife and I work from home.

I'm going from the house panel, through the attic , and out a soffit). Total length before it goes in the ground is 88 feet , then +27feet to get to the shed

I had 2 people come by to quote - and I'm clarifying whats needed before we even get to the shed.

One mentioned something like 2 pole 20a at the house breaker, then 12 AWG off of that ( at least to a junction box before it goes it to the ground)

Another person said 60a ""feeder"" at the house panel, then running different size feeder wires (3x #6 for hots/neutral + #8 ground).

Both said the same thing once we're at the shed - sub panel where there's a circuit for lights, circuit for outlets, and split unit on it's own circuit.

At least from the house panel/main panel and initial wiring ( to a junction box outside of the house before it goes under ground) what should I be looking at to make sure that half is all correct?

Thanks!

1nkf5l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1nkf5l7/rant_about_getting_dumped_and_about_people/,Rant about getting dumped and about people knowing shit about HIV. It probably makes no sense.,"About 2.5 years ago, I (now 26) went on a date with a guy (now 28). It seemed to go successfully and I went back to his for a drink. He told me he had HIV and was undetectable. He was so scared saying it. He even told me I could leave if I wanted. I didn't want to and it was a great decision 😈. He wanted to keep his HIV quiet which was fine by me. Only a few friends of his knew. 

A couple of months ago, he told another ""friend"" and that little prick told everyone. 

The shit he got from people. The looks. The shit I got. People making up all sorts of rumours. My parents thought if he had it then I had it. They gave him shit and said I shouldve stuck to girls. His parents thought I gave it to him and gave me shit. 

I'll put up with a lot of shit but he shouldn't have had to.

Some of my ""friends"" said I was only with him because I'm charitable. Shockingly it was my girls not the guys. That charitable comment got to him. 

Then my parents a few nights ago came over and said we need to break up. Why am I not afraid of ""it"" [the HIV]. I told them they could either apologise and move on or get out. I forced them out. 

Two nights ago, he was like this should not be my problem, its his. He felt guilty that he's causing a rift between me and my family and friends. He said i was probably being charitable and I tried to talk him out if it but no good.

I'm at my friends place since. I got a call this morning from my mother saying our break up is for the best.

I went to the gym today and was still so angry. I went to my priest (dont judge). He said he couldn't talk about it in church but he met me for a coffee. 

He said he was saying this as a friend and not a priest. He said go back home to him if that's what I want. Let him lash out but just say I'm not going anywhere. He said he seems to make me happy.  

This sounds odd but does the priest have the right idea? No matter how much you explained there was no listening to people. ",7,1758217674.0,askgaybros,13,1.0,False

It was probably one of the first 10 bags of coffee I ever got, and it stood out because of it's unusual taste profile. 

Maybe it's nostalgia for those times, or it was a really new and funky direction for coffee that I had never ever expected, but lately I've been desiring that crisp red apple malic acidity. I really want recommendations for light roasts with that flavour profile. If you know any, please let me know, bonus points if it's not too expensive 😅😋🥲",3,1758217557.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False
1nkf3fy,https://i.redd.it/z0x6uvi8nypf1.png,Question for anyone who knows their way around cocktails and liqueurs (Sheridan’s),"I’ve got a question for anyone who knows their way around cocktails and liqueurs. I recently finished a bottle of Sheridan’s (which I love maybe a little too much), and now I’ve got this cool dual-chamber bottle sitting empty. Since the bottle pours two things at once, I was wondering what other two drinks might work well in it.

The original Sheridan’s is a mix of dark coffee-chocolate liqueur with smooth vanilla cream, and the cream side pours a bit slower, so it balances out the flavors. I don’t need to recreate it exactly, but I’d like to try something that has the same kind of balance—two flavors that complement each other when poured together.

Does anyone have good recommendations for combinations that might work? Ideally, it would be something available in the U.S. since that’s where I am.

For reference, Sheridan’s has that nice mix of coffee-chocolate depth with a creamy vanilla smoothness. It’s not overly sweet or strong, which makes it perfect as an after-dinner drink, with coffee, or even just as a tasty shot.

Thanks in advance for any ideas!

1nkf2j6,https://i.redd.it/ybba5rx5nypf1.png,Question for anyone who knows their way around cocktails and liqueurs (Sheridan’s),"I’ve got a question for anyone who knows their way around cocktails and liqueurs. I recently finished a bottle of Sheridan’s (which I love maybe a little too much), and now I’ve got this cool dual-chamber bottle sitting empty. Since the bottle pours two things at once, I was wondering what other two drinks might work well in it.

The original Sheridan’s is a mix of dark coffee-chocolate liqueur with smooth vanilla cream, and the cream side pours a bit slower, so it balances out the flavors. I don’t need to recreate it exactly, but I’d like to try something that has the same kind of balance—two flavors that complement each other when poured together.

Does anyone have good recommendations for combinations that might work? Ideally, it would be something available in the U.S. since that’s where I am.

For reference, Sheridan’s has that nice mix of coffee-chocolate depth with a creamy vanilla smoothness. It’s not overly sweet or strong, which makes it perfect as an after-dinner drink, with coffee, or even just as a tasty shot.

Thanks in advance for any ideas!",0,1758217485.0,bartender,0,0.25,False
1nkf2g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1nkf2g7/my_neighbors_house_vanished_last_night_replaced/,My neighbor’s house vanished last night. Replaced by a copy?,"It happened around 1:13AM

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

*\*\*\**

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

I touched a flowerpot.

Nudged a shovel.

They all had the touch and feel of dense, actual things.

I could still see the guests inside from the back window and watched the same after hours party seemingly stuck on repeat.

*What am I supposed to do? Sneak in? Catch them unawares?*

I kept recording my hand as it touched things in the garden. Watching through the little viewfinder. Hunting anomalies.

There was a marble statue of a male figure in the middle of the yard. It looked like something hauled out of Rome. 

I tapped the statue's chest and quickly discovered my first anomaly.

It felt hot. 

The texture was hard to describe. 

Like freshly printed paper.

I delicately touched the statue again, leaning into its strange heat. On camera, I was able to capture my finger making a very slight indentation in the middle of its solar plexus.

And then, before I could pull back — *the statue grabbed my throat.*

Quick, impervious arms enwrapped me. 

The chokehold was so tight, it hurt to draw breath. 

The camera fell out of my hands. 

The statue started to walk. 

*The statue started to walk?*

I was forced to follow. My toes barely touching the Earth. It heaved me across the garden. My camera swayed along its strap, aimed at the ground. 

The back doors of the Mansion opened on their own. 

“*Gah!”*  I wheezed out. *“Gyeuh!”*

The statue steered me with its arms. Its hot fingers could easily crush my throat.

It marched me inside the Moretti house where I could see something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Instead of furniture and Italian decor, the entire inside was *white grids.* Each of the ceilings, walls and floors were all composed of small white squares with faint blue outlines. 

Like graph paper from math class. 

Without ceremony, the statue let me go onto the middle of the floor. My knees shot out in pain.  

I scrambled up to run, but the door behind us sealed shut. Now the entire space was doorless. Windowless. Everything felt unnaturally lit by these grids.

I glanced at my hand. It was evenly lit from all sides. No shadows anywhere.

*Where the fuck am I?*

Out from a hidden corner, more statues appeared.

Some of their body types corresponded with the party guests I had seen earlier. Except they clearly weren’t human guests. They were just smooth, marble-white copies of the guests.

“Please! Don’t hurt me!” My words echoed through the grid-room. There was something terrifyingly *infinite* about this space.

A white statue with a large gut and pudgy face came up to me. I realized it had the *exact* same shape and stature of the Italian man who yelled at me. Despite his face having no texture, I could still see the template lips curve into a smile. 

“You do not belong here.” His previous accent had disappeared. It was like some cosmic text-to-speech machine was feeding him words.

“No.I  don’t.” I whispered. “Please don’t hurt me..”

The pudgy template man shrugged. A feminine template in the back asked: “why would we hurt you?”

I recoiled, moving away from all of them. My hands touched the hot, papery grid walls. I tried to slink away.

“We would never hurt you.”

“You are one of us.”

“We would never hurt you.”

I reached a corner of the house, and suddenly the white tiles developed color.

Like a growing stain, the entire space started rendering a wooden floor, brown baseboards, and cream wallpaper.

*No… but this is…*

In two more blinks of an eye, I was standing in my own hallway. I could see my Costco calendar hung above the stairway. I recognized my slippers on the floor.

*No no no… this isn’t right…*

I was suddenly outside of my bedroom. I clawed at the handle and opened the door, looking for a way out of this.

And of course, that’s where I saw it.

There, lying in bed, was a perfect white template model … resembling Amy.

In about half a second, her pajamas and skin tone rendered into place. She yawned, stirred a little, and looked up at me.

“Milton?”

I bolted away and explored the rest of the house. It was all too familiar.

Down to apples in the fridge and mouse droppings behind my couch, this was an exact replica of the duplex I had lived in for the last six years.

“Everything okay?” Amy called.

\*\*\*

I told her that I was shaken by a nightmare. And in a sense, I wasn't lying.

This was a nightmare.

Everything I had ever known was some kind of farce. Some kind of simulation I didn't understand.

Even when I left my house to inspect outside, I was still on top of the hill, looking *down* at the Moretti mansion. It’s like I had teleported. It’s like reality had rearranged itself to fool me.

I didn't want Amy to think I was even more unhinged than before.

So I told her nothing.

I couldn’t trust her anyway. *Was she even real?*

It was too big of a madness to share with anyone. So I kept it to myself.

For weeks I’ve kept this to myself.

\*\*\*

I’ve gone through phases where I’ve just laid in bed at home, pretending to be sick, unable to process what I had seen.

*The template people and their white grid world are behind everything.* I couldn’t get it out of my head.

My pretend-wife asked about my upcoming pretend-job teaching pretend-children, and I gave a pretend-answer: “Yes, I’m looking forward to sculpting some new minds this year.”

*But aren’t their minds already sculpted? Isn’t everything already pre-rendered and determined somehow? Isn’t everything just a charade?*

\*\*\*

There were nights where I tried to peel back the skin on my arms. Just to see if there was any white, papery marble inside of me too. 

I couldn’t find anything. Only blood and pain.

For a time, I used to keep my camera on my desk as a reminder—to keep myself sober about these events. 

I had never once watched the footage from my encounters that night. But I knew the truth was recorded on a little SD card in my Canon DLSR.

And then one morning … I deleted the footage.

I deleted the footage without ever having reviewed it.

I deleted the only piece of evidence I had.

\*\*\*

Months have gone by and now I’m back teaching at school.

All the peachy, fresh-skinned faces, and all the tests and homework to review, and all the dumb Gen Z jokes flying over my head — it all forged into a nice, wonderful reminder that life needs distractions.

That we should keep ourselves busy being social, and surrounded by others.

Distractions are good. They’re great in fact.

\*\*\*

Most recently, I’ve broken through my writer’s block. I think it's helped to write this whole story out so I could get it out of my system.

The key was finding the right title. Once I had the title, everything just started to flow.

*“Some Things Should Be Left Well Enough Alone.”*

It’s got that great, guiding principle *feel* to it. I’ve been repeating it back to Amy almost every day like a mantra. It helps me get by.

They’re words to live by, I say.

1nkf1uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/comments/1nkf1uv/my_neighbors_house_vanished_last_night_replaced/,My neighbor’s house vanished last night. Replaced by a copy?,"It happened around 1:13AM

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

*\*\*\**

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

I touched a flowerpot.

Nudged a shovel.

They all had the touch and feel of dense, actual things.

I could still see the guests inside from the back window and watched the same after hours party seemingly stuck on repeat.

*What am I supposed to do? Sneak in? Catch them unawares?*

I kept recording my hand as it touched things in the garden. Watching through the little viewfinder. Hunting anomalies.

There was a marble statue of a male figure in the middle of the yard. It looked like something hauled out of Rome. 

I tapped the statue's chest and quickly discovered my first anomaly.

It felt hot. 

The texture was hard to describe. 

Like freshly printed paper.

I delicately touched the statue again, leaning into its strange heat. On camera, I was able to capture my finger making a very slight indentation in the middle of its solar plexus.

And then, before I could pull back — *the statue grabbed my throat.*

Quick, impervious arms enwrapped me. 

The chokehold was so tight, it hurt to draw breath. 

The camera fell out of my hands. 

The statue started to walk. 

*The statue started to walk?*

I was forced to follow. My toes barely touching the Earth. It heaved me across the garden. My camera swayed along its strap, aimed at the ground. 

The back doors of the Mansion opened on their own. 

“*Gah!”*  I wheezed out. *“Gyeuh!”*

The statue steered me with its arms. Its hot fingers could easily crush my throat.

It marched me inside the Moretti house where I could see something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Instead of furniture and Italian decor, the entire inside was *white grids.* Each of the ceilings, walls and floors were all composed of small white squares with faint blue outlines. 

Like graph paper from math class. 

Without ceremony, the statue let me go onto the middle of the floor. My knees shot out in pain.  

I scrambled up to run, but the door behind us sealed shut. Now the entire space was doorless. Windowless. Everything felt unnaturally lit by these grids.

I glanced at my hand. It was evenly lit from all sides. No shadows anywhere.

*Where the fuck am I?*

Out from a hidden corner, more statues appeared.

Some of their body types corresponded with the party guests I had seen earlier. Except they clearly weren’t human guests. They were just smooth, marble-white copies of the guests.

“Please! Don’t hurt me!” My words echoed through the grid-room. There was something terrifyingly *infinite* about this space.

A white statue with a large gut and pudgy face came up to me. I realized it had the *exact* same shape and stature of the Italian man who yelled at me. Despite his face having no texture, I could still see the template lips curve into a smile. 

“You do not belong here.” His previous accent had disappeared. It was like some cosmic text-to-speech machine was feeding him words.

“No.I  don’t.” I whispered. “Please don’t hurt me..”

The pudgy template man shrugged. A feminine template in the back asked: “why would we hurt you?”

I recoiled, moving away from all of them. My hands touched the hot, papery grid walls. I tried to slink away.

“We would never hurt you.”

“You are one of us.”

“We would never hurt you.”

I reached a corner of the house, and suddenly the white tiles developed color.

Like a growing stain, the entire space started rendering a wooden floor, brown baseboards, and cream wallpaper.

*No… but this is…*

In two more blinks of an eye, I was standing in my own hallway. I could see my Costco calendar hung above the stairway. I recognized my slippers on the floor.

*No no no… this isn’t right…*

I was suddenly outside of my bedroom. I clawed at the handle and opened the door, looking for a way out of this.

And of course, that’s where I saw it.

There, lying in bed, was a perfect white template model … resembling Amy.

In about half a second, her pajamas and skin tone rendered into place. She yawned, stirred a little, and looked up at me.

“Milton?”

I bolted away and explored the rest of the house. It was all too familiar.

Down to apples in the fridge and mouse droppings behind my couch, this was an exact replica of the duplex I had lived in for the last six years.

“Everything okay?” Amy called.

\*\*\*

I told her that I was shaken by a nightmare. And in a sense, I wasn't lying.

This was a nightmare.

Everything I had ever known was some kind of farce. Some kind of simulation I didn't understand.

Even when I left my house to inspect outside, I was still on top of the hill, looking *down* at the Moretti mansion. It’s like I had teleported. It’s like reality had rearranged itself to fool me.

I didn't want Amy to think I was even more unhinged than before.

So I told her nothing.

I couldn’t trust her anyway. *Was she even real?*

It was too big of a madness to share with anyone. So I kept it to myself.

For weeks I’ve kept this to myself.

\*\*\*

I’ve gone through phases where I’ve just laid in bed at home, pretending to be sick, unable to process what I had seen.

*The template people and their white grid world are behind everything.* I couldn’t get it out of my head.

My pretend-wife asked about my upcoming pretend-job teaching pretend-children, and I gave a pretend-answer: “Yes, I’m looking forward to sculpting some new minds this year.”

*But aren’t their minds already sculpted? Isn’t everything already pre-rendered and determined somehow? Isn’t everything just a charade?*

\*\*\*

There were nights where I tried to peel back the skin on my arms. Just to see if there was any white, papery marble inside of me too. 

I couldn’t find anything. Only blood and pain.

For a time, I used to keep my camera on my desk as a reminder—to keep myself sober about these events. 

I had never once watched the footage from my encounters that night. But I knew the truth was recorded on a little SD card in my Canon DLSR.

And then one morning … I deleted the footage.

I deleted the footage without ever having reviewed it.

I deleted the only piece of evidence I had.

\*\*\*

Months have gone by and now I’m back teaching at school.

All the peachy, fresh-skinned faces, and all the tests and homework to review, and all the dumb Gen Z jokes flying over my head — it all forged into a nice, wonderful reminder that life needs distractions.

That we should keep ourselves busy being social, and surrounded by others.

Distractions are good. They’re great in fact.

\*\*\*

Most recently, I’ve broken through my writer’s block. I think it's helped to write this whole story out so I could get it out of my system.

The key was finding the right title. Once I had the title, everything just started to flow.

*“Some Things Should Be Left Well Enough Alone.”*

It’s got that great, guiding principle *feel* to it. I’ve been repeating it back to Amy almost every day like a mantra. It helps me get by.

They’re words to live by, I say.

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks.

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

I touched a flowerpot.

Nudged a shovel.

They all had the touch and feel of dense, actual things.

I could still see the guests inside from the back window and watched the same after hours party seemingly stuck on repeat.

*What am I supposed to do? Sneak in? Catch them unawares?*

I kept recording my hand as it touched things in the garden. Watching through the little viewfinder. Hunting anomalies.

There was a marble statue of a male figure in the middle of the yard. It looked like something hauled out of Rome. 

I tapped the statue's chest and quickly discovered my first anomaly.

It felt hot. 

The texture was hard to describe. 

Like freshly printed paper.

I delicately touched the statue again, leaning into its strange heat. On camera, I was able to capture my finger making a very slight indentation in the middle of its solar plexus.

And then, before I could pull back — *the statue grabbed my throat.*

Quick, impervious arms enwrapped me. 

The chokehold was so tight, it hurt to draw breath. 

The camera fell out of my hands. 

The statue started to walk. 

*The statue started to walk?*

I was forced to follow. My toes barely touching the Earth. It heaved me across the garden. My camera swayed along its strap, aimed at the ground. 

The back doors of the Mansion opened on their own. 

“*Gah!”*  I wheezed out. *“Gyeuh!”*

The statue steered me with its arms. Its hot fingers could easily crush my throat.

It marched me inside the Moretti house where I could see something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Instead of furniture and Italian decor, the entire inside was *white grids.* Each of the ceilings, walls and floors were all composed of small white squares with faint blue outlines. 

Like graph paper from math class. 

Without ceremony, the statue let me go onto the middle of the floor. My knees shot out in pain.  

I scrambled up to run, but the door behind us sealed shut. Now the entire space was doorless. Windowless. Everything felt unnaturally lit by these grids.

I glanced at my hand. It was evenly lit from all sides. No shadows anywhere.

*Where the fuck am I?*

Out from a hidden corner, more statues appeared.

Some of their body types corresponded with the party guests I had seen earlier. Except they clearly weren’t human guests. They were just smooth, marble-white copies of the guests.

“Please! Don’t hurt me!” My words echoed through the grid-room. There was something terrifyingly *infinite* about this space.

A white statue with a large gut and pudgy face came up to me. I realized it had the *exact* same shape and stature of the Italian man who yelled at me. Despite his face having no texture, I could still see the template lips curve into a smile. 

“You do not belong here.” His previous accent had disappeared. It was like some cosmic text-to-speech machine was feeding him words.

“No.I  don’t.” I whispered. “Please don’t hurt me..”

The pudgy template man shrugged. A feminine template in the back asked: “why would we hurt you?”

I recoiled, moving away from all of them. My hands touched the hot, papery grid walls. I tried to slink away.

“We would never hurt you.”

“You are one of us.”

“We would never hurt you.”

I reached a corner of the house, and suddenly the white tiles developed color.

Like a growing stain, the entire space started rendering a wooden floor, brown baseboards, and cream wallpaper.

*No… but this is…*

In two more blinks of an eye, I was standing in my own hallway. I could see my Costco calendar hung above the stairway. I recognized my slippers on the floor.

*No no no… this isn’t right…*

I was suddenly outside of my bedroom. I clawed at the handle and opened the door, looking for a way out of this.

And of course, that’s where I saw it.

There, lying in bed, was a perfect white template model … resembling Amy.

In about half a second, her pajamas and skin tone rendered into place. She yawned, stirred a little, and looked up at me.

“Milton?”

I bolted away and explored the rest of the house. It was all too familiar.

Down to apples in the fridge and mouse droppings behind my couch, this was an exact replica of the duplex I had lived in for the last six years.

“Everything okay?” Amy called.

\*\*\*

I told her that I was shaken by a nightmare. And in a sense, I wasn't lying.

This was a nightmare.

Everything I had ever known was some kind of farce. Some kind of simulation I didn't understand.

Even when I left my house to inspect outside, I was still on top of the hill, looking *down* at the Moretti mansion. It’s like I had teleported. It’s like reality had rearranged itself to fool me.

I didn't want Amy to think I was even more unhinged than before.

So I told her nothing.

I couldn’t trust her anyway. *Was she even real?*

It was too big of a madness to share with anyone. So I kept it to myself.

For weeks I’ve kept this to myself.

\*\*\*

I’ve gone through phases where I’ve just laid in bed at home, pretending to be sick, unable to process what I had seen.

*The template people and their white grid world are behind everything.* I couldn’t get it out of my head.

My pretend-wife asked about my upcoming pretend-job teaching pretend-children, and I gave a pretend-answer: “Yes, I’m looking forward to sculpting some new minds this year.”

*But aren’t their minds already sculpted? Isn’t everything already pre-rendered and determined somehow? Isn’t everything just a charade?*

\*\*\*

There were nights where I tried to peel back the skin on my arms. Just to see if there was any white, papery marble inside of me too. 

I couldn’t find anything. Only blood and pain.

For a time, I used to keep my camera on my desk as a reminder—to keep myself sober about these events. 

I had never once watched the footage from my encounters that night. But I knew the truth was recorded on a little SD card in my Canon DLSR.

And then one morning … I deleted the footage.

I deleted the footage without ever having reviewed it.

I deleted the only piece of evidence I had.

\*\*\*

Months have gone by and now I’m back teaching at school.

All the peachy, fresh-skinned faces, and all the tests and homework to review, and all the dumb Gen Z jokes flying over my head — it all forged into a nice, wonderful reminder that life needs distractions.

That we should keep ourselves busy being social, and surrounded by others.

Distractions are good. They’re great in fact.

\*\*\*

Most recently, I’ve broken through my writer’s block. I think it's helped to write this whole story out so I could get it out of my system.

The key was finding the right title. Once I had the title, everything just started to flow.

*“Some Things Should Be Left Well Enough Alone.”*

It’s got that great, guiding principle *feel* to it. I’ve been repeating it back to Amy almost every day like a mantra. It helps me get by.

They’re words to live by, I say.

1nkf12w,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1nkf12w/the_reality_blip/,The Reality Blip,"It happened around 1:13AM

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

*\*\*\**

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to one bedroom barndominiums, space efficiency and aesthetic appeal go hand in hand. With a few creative floor plans, you can have a cozy yet stylish living space that meets all your needs. Whether you’re looking to downsize, create a vacation getaway, or want a unique home, there are numerous innovative designs to consider.

### Open Concept Living

One of the most popular trends in one bedroom barndominiums is the open concept layout. This design removes walls to create a flow between the living room, kitchen, and dining area. The advantages are abundant:

- **Natural Light:** Fewer walls mean more windows, allowing natural light to flood the space.
- **Enhanced Interaction:** An open layout encourages social interaction, perfect for entertaining guests.
- **Versatile Furnishing:** Without defined rooms, you can configure furniture in various ways to suit your style.

### Utilizing Vertical Space

In a one bedroom barndominium, every inch matters. To maximize your space, consider designs that utilize vertical space. This can include:

- **Lofted Sleeping Areas:** A loft can double as a sleeping area and provide additional storage underneath.
- **Built-In Shelving:** Wall-mounted shelves or cabinets can store items without taking up floor space.
- **High Ceilings:** high ceilings can give an airy feel while providing space for tall furniture.

### Compact Kitchen Designs

The kitchen is often the heart of the home. In a one bedroom barndominium, consider compact yet efficient kitchen designs. Here are some ideas:

- **Galley Style:** This layout uses two parallel walls and maximizes space for cooking and storage.
- **Island with Storage:** Adding an island can provide additional countertop space and hidden storage.
- **Multi-Functional Appliances:** Choose appliances that serve multiple purposes, like an oven that also acts as a microwave.

### Creative Use of Rooms

Every room in a one bedroom barndominium can have multiple purposes. Instead of sticking to traditional layouts, think outside the box:

- **Home Office Nook:** Install a small desk in a corner of your living space, making it functional for work without needing an additional room.
- **Guest Area:** Use a fold-out couch or Murphy bed in the living area for accommodating guests.
- **Hobby Space:** Dedicate a corner for your hobbies, whether that’s crafting, painting, or reading.

### Stylish Interior Decor

Interior design plays a crucial role in creating a cozy atmosphere in your one bedroom barndominium. Here are some stylish tips:

- **Use Neutral Colors:** A neutral palette can make the space feel larger and more serene.
- **Incorporate Natural Elements:** Wood beams, stone accents, or metal fittings add character and warmth.
- **Smart Lighting:** Use a combination of ambient and task lighting to enhance the space.

### Maximizing Outdoor Space

Don’t forget about the outdoor area! Connecting your indoor barndominium with a well-designed outdoor space can enhance your living experience:

- **Deck or Patio:** A small deck can serve as an outdoor living room.
- **Garden Area:** Use planters to create a beautiful garden even in limited space.
- **Outdoor Kitchen:** If you enjoy grilling, an outdoor kitchen can elevate your entertaining game.

With careful planning and creativity, one bedroom barndominiums can combine style with functionality. By selecting innovative floor plans and decor ideas, you can create a living space that meets your needs while being delightful to reside in. Explore various possibilities and customize your barndominium to reflect your personal taste, ensuring that your home is not just a residence but a personal sanctuary.

Before making decisions, assess your one-bedroom barndominium's layout. The open floor plan often found in barndominiums can be both a blessing and a challenge. Here's how to understand your space better:

- **Measure** each area for furniture placement and decor decisions.
- **Identify** natural light sources and plan your color scheme accordingly.
- **Visualize** flow in the room to ensure it feels open while serving all your needs.

### Personalizing Your Living Area

The living area is where you’ll relax and entertain. Here are some personalization ideas:

- **Choose a color palette** that speaks to you. Consider warm, inviting shades like soft yellows or earthy greens to create a homely feel.
- **Incorporate personal artwork**. Use local artists or prints that resonate with your personality. Hang them strategically to create a focal point.
- **Select furniture** that serves dual purposes. For example, a coffee table with storage not only looks sleek but also helps declutter your space.

### Creating a Functional Kitchen

Your barndominium's kitchen should blend style and practicality. Here are tips to personalize it:

- **Opt for open shelving** to display your favorite dishes and decor items. This not only looks great but also keeps essentials within reach.
- **Incorporate a kitchen island** that serves as extra storage and a cooking prep area. If space allows, add barstools for a casual dining vibe.
- **Play with lighting** in the kitchen. Pendant lights over the island or under-cabinet lighting can add functionality and warmth.

### Designing Your Bedroom Sanctuary

Your bedroom should be a peaceful retreat. To elevate this space, consider the following:

- **Invest in quality bedding**. Plush comforters and a variety of pillows can transform your bed into a sanctuary.
- **Add texture** with area rugs, curtains, and throws. Use soft materials to give your bedroom a cozy touch.
- **Create a reading nook** by adding a comfortable chair and a small bookshelf. This encourages relaxation and offers a personal escape within your home.

### Enhancing Outdoor Spaces

The exterior of your barndominium can be just as inviting as the interior. Here are some tips to personalize your outdoor areas:

- **Incorporate plants** and flowers along the entrance. Potted plants or a small garden can bring life to your doorstep.
- **Create a cozy patio** with seating and a fire pit. This extends your living space outdoors and is perfect for gatherings.
- **Utilize outdoor lighting**, such as string lights or lanterns, to create a warm ambiance during the evenings.

### Utilizing Smart Technology

In today’s world, technology plays a key role in making our lives easier. Your barndominium can benefit from smarter systems:

- **Install smart lighting** that can be controlled via an app. This allows for quick adjustments depending on your mood or time of day.
- **Use smart thermostats** to efficiently manage heating and cooling. This keeps your home comfortable while saving on energy bills.
- **Consider security systems** that include cameras and motion detectors for peace of mind.

Personalizing your one-bedroom barndominium is a rewarding journey. It’s about creating a space that not only reflects your style but also meets your functional needs. Embrace your creativity, and let your home tell your unique story.

### Conclusion

Designing a one-bedroom barndominium can be an exciting journey that combines creativity and practicality. By carefully selecting your floor plan, you can maximize both space and style. Consider open layouts that encourage airflow and light, making your barndominium feel more spacious. versatile furniture pieces can help you make the most out of your square footage while enhancing the overall design aesthetic.

Personalizing your barndominium is where you can truly make it your own. Use decor elements that resonate with you, whether it’s rustic charm or modern flair. Choosing a cohesive color palette will create a harmonious look throughout your home. Don’t forget about functionality—arranging your space to fit your lifestyle is crucial. For instance, creating multifunctional areas can allow you to entertain friends, work from home, or simply relax in comfort.

As you embark on your barndominium project, let your personality shine through every detail. From the layout to the final touches, each decision contributes to a space that reflects who you are. Don’t shy away from incorporating eclectic elements or sustainable materials; these choices can enhance both the beauty and functionality of your home. Ultimately, a well-planned and thoughtfully decorated one-bedroom barndominium can be more than just a living space; it can be a sanctuary that fulfills your dreams and aspirations.

Since the bottle pours two things at once, I was wondering what other two drinks might work well in it.

The original Sheridan’s is a mix of dark coffee-chocolate liqueur with smooth vanilla cream, and the cream side pours a bit slower, so it balances out the flavors. I don’t need to recreate it exactly, but I’d like to try something that has the same kind of balance—two flavors that complement each other when poured together.

Does anyone have good recommendations for combinations that might work? Ideally, it would be something available in the U.S. since that’s where I am.

For reference, Sheridan’s has that nice mix of coffee-chocolate depth with a creamy vanilla smoothness. It’s not overly sweet or strong, which makes it perfect as an after-dinner drink, with coffee, or even just as a tasty shot.

I’m a **Mexican citizen** living in the US on a **TN visa** (for us Mexicans it’s an actual visa from the consulate, not like Canadians who just get TN status at the border).

I also got **Canadian PR last year**, and now I’m trying to figure out the best way to hit the residency obligation (730 days in 5 years).

Workwise: my company is US-based. They’re cool with me working remote from the US, but if I wanted to live in Canada, they’re suggesting to put me on some EOR/PEO setup, which I’d really like to avoid (would mess with my benefits/seniority/career growth).

So right now I see two possible strategies:

1. **Live in a Canadian city** near the border and commute into the US (to a coworking space, etc.) for work.
2. **Live in a US border city** and make daily trips into Canada (even just to jog, grab coffee, etc.) since *partial days in Canada count as full days* for PR obligations.

I also have **Global Entry** which would make coming into the US easier and would plan on getting NEXUS to make border crossings smoother eventually

Has anyone here tried something similar? Any suggestions for border towns/cities? Is one option way more realistic than the other in terms of border hassle, work-life balance, or legal complications? Would love to hear how others have structured their lives around daily/regular crossings.

I would personally label myself as demisexual, though some online tests would tag me as cupiosexual. I want to mention upfront that you could classify me as a neurodivergent individual, since I probably have some sort of autism-spectrum disorder. You won't notice it much, but it could be a possible explanation for why I can be weird from time (this shouldn't be an excuse by the way) Since we got that out of the way, *let us dive more into my persona*

 

***My persona***

I live in Central Europe, so due to my origin I'm able to speak German as well as English. I'm of Caucasian ethnicity, I have white skin, an average build at a height of 175 cm (or 5 ft 9 in) have medium-short brown hair on top, green-grey eyes with glasses on rare occasions & a short stubble face to round things off

 

***My lifestyle***

My occupation is something I can be very passionate about & really enjoy on a deep basis. When I'm not active due to work, I love to be active in my free time by going to the gym, going for a run or biking for example. Something I like to pair these activities with is listening to music or to a good podcast, but I usually prefer to watch rather than just listen to them. During the day I really love to drink a good cup of coffee somewhere or at home, so one day I will definitely buy myself a barista coffee machine. Currently I live on an omnivore diet, I like to cook & try different recipes. Next to that I have interests in psychology, philosophy, medicine, health & science to name a few

 

***My preferences***

I'm here looking for a female who is open to a long-term relationship aged between 18 - 28. Preferably from Europe, but I'm also open to females from (North) America. I want someone who is able to participate in a normal conversation & is emotionally available. Last but not least, someone who looks after their health & therefore has no emotional (lingering) baggage & maintains a rational normal weight

I’ve watched all the tutorials read the manual, and YouTube videos. I understand best practice for hot coffee is to preheat the portafilter, run a few blank shots through cup and this is what I do. I also then preheat my double walled latte cup in microwave for 1:30-2:00 minutes. I’ve gotten to adjusting the brew temp on the machine to the highest setting. 

I have no complaints really on the taste but for some reason at best the coffee still comes out mildly warm. Do I need to run like 3-4 blank shots through the portafilter or maybe even heat it up? Just wish there was a way to ensure the coffee came out coffee shop hot because it certainly tastes as good or better than my coffee shops. I see this question asked a lot and I feel like other than buying a self heating mug I’m probably doing everything I can and it’s just a machine limitation of not being able to pre heat the portafilter but would love if anyone has ideas.

1nket5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nket5o/my_neighbors_house_vanished_last_night_replaced/,My neighbor’s house vanished last night. Replaced by a copy?,"It happened around 1:13AM

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

*\*\*\**

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

I touched a flowerpot.

Nudged a shovel.

They all had the touch and feel of dense, actual things.

I could still see the guests inside from the back window and watched the same after hours party seemingly stuck on repeat.

*What am I supposed to do? Sneak in? Catch them unawares?*

I kept recording my hand as it touched things in the garden. Watching through the little viewfinder. Hunting anomalies.

There was a marble statue of a male figure in the middle of the yard. It looked like something hauled out of Rome. 

I tapped the statue's chest and quickly discovered my first anomaly.

It felt hot. 

The texture was hard to describe. 

Like freshly printed paper.

I delicately touched the statue again, leaning into its strange heat. On camera, I was able to capture my finger making a very slight indentation in the middle of its solar plexus.

And then, before I could pull back — *the statue grabbed my throat.*

Quick, impervious arms enwrapped me. 

The chokehold was so tight, it hurt to draw breath. 

The camera fell out of my hands. 

The statue started to walk. 

*The statue started to walk?*

I was forced to follow. My toes barely touching the Earth. It heaved me across the garden. My camera swayed along its strap, aimed at the ground. 

The back doors of the Mansion opened on their own. 

“*Gah!”*  I wheezed out. *“Gyeuh!”*

The statue steered me with its arms. Its hot fingers could easily crush my throat.

It marched me inside the Moretti house where I could see something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Instead of furniture and Italian decor, the entire inside was *white grids.* Each of the ceilings, walls and floors were all composed of small white squares with faint blue outlines. 

Like graph paper from math class. 

Without ceremony, the statue let me go onto the middle of the floor. My knees shot out in pain.  

I scrambled up to run, but the door behind us sealed shut. Now the entire space was doorless. Windowless. Everything felt unnaturally lit by these grids.

I glanced at my hand. It was evenly lit from all sides. No shadows anywhere.

*Where the fuck am I?*

Out from a hidden corner, more statues appeared.

Some of their body types corresponded with the party guests I had seen earlier. Except they clearly weren’t human guests. They were just smooth, marble-white copies of the guests.

“Please! Don’t hurt me!” My words echoed through the grid-room. There was something terrifyingly *infinite* about this space.

A white statue with a large gut and pudgy face came up to me. I realized it had the *exact* same shape and stature of the Italian man who yelled at me. Despite his face having no texture, I could still see the template lips curve into a smile. 

“You do not belong here.” His previous accent had disappeared. It was like some cosmic text-to-speech machine was feeding him words.

“No.I  don’t.” I whispered. “Please don’t hurt me..”

The pudgy template man shrugged. A feminine template in the back asked: “why would we hurt you?”

I recoiled, moving away from all of them. My hands touched the hot, papery grid walls. I tried to slink away.

“We would never hurt you.”

“You are one of us.”

“We would never hurt you.”

I reached a corner of the house, and suddenly the white tiles developed color.

Like a growing stain, the entire space started rendering a wooden floor, brown baseboards, and cream wallpaper.

*No… but this is…*

In two more blinks of an eye, I was standing in my own hallway. I could see my Costco calendar hung above the stairway. I recognized my slippers on the floor.

*No no no… this isn’t right…*

I was suddenly outside of my bedroom. I clawed at the handle and opened the door, looking for a way out of this.

And of course, that’s where I saw it.

There, lying in bed, was a perfect white template model … resembling Amy.

In about half a second, her pajamas and skin tone rendered into place. She yawned, stirred a little, and looked up at me.

“Milton?”

I bolted away and explored the rest of the house. It was all too familiar.

Down to apples in the fridge and mouse droppings behind my couch, this was an exact replica of the duplex I had lived in for the last six years.

“Everything okay?” Amy called.

\*\*\*

I told her that I was shaken by a nightmare. And in a sense, I wasn't lying.

This was a nightmare.

Everything I had ever known was some kind of farce. Some kind of simulation I didn't understand.

Even when I left my house to inspect outside, I was still on top of the hill, looking *down* at the Moretti mansion. It’s like I had teleported. It’s like reality had rearranged itself to fool me.

I didn't want Amy to think I was even more unhinged than before.

So I told her nothing.

I couldn’t trust her anyway. *Was she even real?*

It was too big of a madness to share with anyone. So I kept it to myself.

For weeks I’ve kept this to myself.

\*\*\*

I’ve gone through phases where I’ve just laid in bed at home, pretending to be sick, unable to process what I had seen.

*The template people and their white grid world are behind everything.* I couldn’t get it out of my head.

My pretend-wife asked about my upcoming pretend-job teaching pretend-children, and I gave a pretend-answer: “Yes, I’m looking forward to sculpting some new minds this year.”

*But aren’t their minds already sculpted? Isn’t everything already pre-rendered and determined somehow? Isn’t everything just a charade?*

\*\*\*

There were nights where I tried to peel back the skin on my arms. Just to see if there was any white, papery marble inside of me too. 

I couldn’t find anything. Only blood and pain.

For a time, I used to keep my camera on my desk as a reminder—to keep myself sober about these events. 

I had never once watched the footage from my encounters that night. But I knew the truth was recorded on a little SD card in my Canon DLSR.

And then one morning … I deleted the footage.

I deleted the footage without ever having reviewed it.

I deleted the only piece of evidence I had.

\*\*\*

Months have gone by and now I’m back teaching at school.

All the peachy, fresh-skinned faces, and all the tests and homework to review, and all the dumb Gen Z jokes flying over my head — it all forged into a nice, wonderful reminder that life needs distractions.

That we should keep ourselves busy being social, and surrounded by others.

Distractions are good. They’re great in fact.

\*\*\*

Most recently, I’ve broken through my writer’s block. I think it's helped to write this whole story out so I could get it out of my system.

The key was finding the right title. Once I had the title, everything just started to flow.

*“Some Things Should Be Left Well Enough Alone.”*

It’s got that great, guiding principle *feel* to it. I’ve been repeating it back to Amy almost every day like a mantra. It helps me get by.

They’re words to live by, I say.

Back at his Bay Ridge hotel, Tom dialed Beth, his secretary, who was holding down the fort at his L.A. office, letting clients and prospects know he’d be out of town for a couple of weeks, dealing with a death in the family.

Beth’s voice, warm with a matronly grandmotherly calm, came through the line—a stark contrast to his last two hires: hotshot Doris, who’d stirred an unrequited ache in him, and psycho Madge, who’d tried to put him in the ground.

“Hey, Beth, how’s the home front?” Tom asked, settling onto the creaky hotel bed.

“Busy, boss,” Beth said. “I’m taking callback numbers. You’re losing business out there.”

“I hear you,” Tom said, his voice low. “Trying to tie up loose ends here. Brooklyn’s got its pull, but it’s also reminding me why I haven’t been back in twenty years.”

“I’m telling folks you’ll be back in a week or two. For ongoing cases, I said Sam Chandler’s pitching in.”

“Good work, Beth. I’m aiming for two weeks, tops. Not sure if I’m helping or just stirring up more trouble here.”

“Alright, boss. Other line’s flashing. That all?”

“Yeah, get that, Beth. Call me if anything urgent pops up.”

Tom leaned back on the hotel bed, eyes closed, the day’s weight pressing hard. When things didn’t add up, when confusion clouded his mind, that’s when a spark sometimes hit.

First, he’d track down Jenny Miscussa, the spinster. If she could describe the killer—height, distinctive gait, left- or right-handed—it might not name the bastard but could rule out others.

He also needed to corner Jerry, the kid, before Mike Fox got to him. Then hit Maimonides Hospital at midnight to grill Jimmy’s coworkers, see what they knew about his late-night habits.

Too much ground to cover, too little time. Two weeks felt right. Ann had nudged him to walk away, Mike and Monsignor Coffey saw his digging as meddling at best. Fine. If he couldn’t crack this case in fourteen days, he’d say goodbye to Ann, board a one-way flight to L.A., and leave Brooklyn in the rearview.

Tom reached Jenny Miscussa’s apartment building on 65th Street, facing a locked middle door that required a buzzer. He waited ten minutes for someone to come or go. When that didn’t happen, he started ringing bells. On the third try, a buzz granted him entry.
He climbed two flights to the third floor and rapped on Jenny’s door.

“Who’s there?” a woman’s voice snapped from the other side, curt and wary.

“Pharmacy. Delivery for Jenny Miscussa,” Tom said, taking a gamble. At her age, she was likely fixated on pills her doctor prescribed.

It worked. A chain slid free, two locks—a deadbolt and knob—clicked, and the door cracked open. Tom wedged his foot in.

“Where’s my medication?” Jenny asked, suspicion creeping into her voice.

“I’m a private investigator, working the Skull Murder case,” Tom said, his tone steady. “Word is you saw it happen.”

“I didn’t see anything. I was sleeping. Get out, or I’ll call the police!”

“Easy, Jenny,” Tom said. “The press is crawling all over this. If I get pinched, they’ll dig into why I was here. You want your name splashed on the front page with a killer on the loose?”

“No!” she cried, her voice breaking into soft sobs. “What do you want from me?”

“Just a couple questions, nothing wild,” Tom said. “Answer, and I’m gone. No one’ll know I was here.”

She opened the door wider, letting him into the foyer but no further, her arms crossed tight.

“Can you describe him—height, weight, did he walk funny, left- or right-handed? Tell me what you saw, and I’m out of here.”

Jenny trembled, but Tom’s calm, professional air steadied her. 

“He wasn’t tall—maybe five-nine,” she said. 
“Regina Pacis’s lights were on. The victim was heading toward 13th Avenue. The killer came from 12th, snuck up behind, and swung a crowbar—right-handed. When the man fell, the killer dropped the weapon and vanished up 12th toward 64th Street. He was slightly bowlegged, dressed all in black, a dark cap pulled low over his face. Couldn’t see it. Glad I didn’t. 
I’ll never forget that little dog’s cries, knowing its human was gone.” Her voice eased, unburdened by the secret.

“What’d you do next?” Tom asked.

“Called an ambulance, then went to bed,” she said. “Heard the sirens when the police arrived but stayed put. Didn’t want to see any more.”

“You did good, Jenny,” Tom said. “The victim, Jimmy, was my boyhood friend. I’m after justice for him. Thank you.”

“You promised not to tell the police,” she said, her voice quivering. “Please, I want to be left alone. I thought you had my heart medication. This excitement’s no good for me.”

“You have my word,” Tom said. “This stays between us. I’m leaving now.”

Tom slipped a fifty-dollar bill into Jenny’s hand and hustled down the stairs to his car. He needed a breather, so he stopped at J&V Pizza on 18th Avenue for a slice and a Pepsi.

It was early, so he settled for a reheated slice from yesterday. When the counter guy pulled it from the oven, the cheese and tomato sauce sizzled in perfect harmony. Even a day-old Brooklyn slice outshone anything in L.A.

Tom ate standing at a wall counter, mulling Jenny’s words. The killer—five-nine, right-handed, slightly bowlegged, dressed in black with a dark cap pulled low—knew Jimmy, had stalked him. Not a woman, but Ann had Jerry, and one of Jimmy’s nurses could have a jealous husband or boyfriend who took a crowbar to his skull. 
Average height, bowlegged, right-handed—not much, but more than he had.

The carb rush sharpened his mind, fueling him for the next move: confronting Jerry, Ann’s pizza boy. Tom chuckled, thinking he might’ve eaten free if he’d name-dropped Ann.

Marino’s Pizzeria was a long block away. He left his car on 64th Street and walked. Inside, Jerry and a short, chubby older man—worked the counter, tossing dough.

Tom knew Ann had probably prepped Jerry, so he’d need to tread lighter than with her. The kid would be on guard.

“Jerry,” Tom said, offering a handshake.

“Yeah,” Jerry replied, spinning a dough round, tossing it high, and catching it with both fists.

“I’m a friend of Ann’s and Jimmy’s, go way back to our kid days,” Tom said. “Private eye from L.A., trying to catch Jimmy’s killer.”

“Well, it ain’t Tony,” Jerry said with a laugh, nodding at his plump sidekick, who flashed an affectionate grin before kneading dough.

Jerry stepped from behind the counter and gestured to a table. “Ann said you’d probably show. Detective Fox was here last night. She told me to be straight with him. Didn’t need to—I got nothing to hide.”

“What’d you tell Fox?” Tom asked, wishing he’d beaten the cop to the punch.

“That I’m in love with Ann,” Jerry said. “We’ve been seeing each other a while, mostly nights when Jimmy was at work.”

“Good you were honest,” Tom said. “He’d have sniffed out any cover-up.”

“Jimmy was a customer,” Jerry went on. “Bought slices, talked Yankee baseball. Stopped coming in after I started with Ann. Figure he knew but never called me out. Probably ’cause he was messing around too.”

Tom saw why Ann fell for Jerry. The kid was genuine, his easy charm winning over even Tony, who shot him warm glances. Years of police work had honed Tom’s read on people—Jerry was the real deal.

“As for Fox, you’re likely not a suspect, but you’re a person of interest,” Tom said. “He’s got DA pressure to call it a botched mugging. I’m the pain in the ass digging deeper. Act normal, treat Ann right, and you’re good with me.”

“Thanks, Tom,” Jerry said, extending his hand. Tom shook it. “You hungry? Whatever you want’s on the house for a friend.”

“Nah, just ate,” Tom said. “But I’ll swing by before I leave, take you up on that.”

Tom mentally drew a line through Jerry’s name—not an X, just a single stroke.

Chapter Six

Tom stepped out of the shower at the Bay Ridge Hotel, towel in hand, when the phone jangled. He snatched it up. Ann’s voice came through, edged with scorn.

“Hi, Tom, it’s Ann.”

“Ann, what’s wrong?” Tom asked, wrapping the towel around his waist.

“I’ve been going through Jimmy’s things. Thought it’d be easier by now. Found three women’s phone numbers scrawled on Maimonides notepaper. And a photo of a pretty blonde with ‘I love you too’ scribbled on the back. He was a son of a bitch, Tom.”

“I’m sorry you had to find that, Ann,” Tom said, his voice low. “I know it cuts deep. Good you called. Let me come by and take a look.”

“I’ve got two more appointments. Stop by the apartment around eight. But Tom, after that, I’m done. Jimmy’s gone—he’s not my husband anymore. Never really was. I appreciate what you’ve done, but I’m moving on for good. Come say goodbye before you leave, but as for Jimmy’s mess, I don’t want to hear it.”

“I get it,” Tom said. “If this doesn’t break soon, I’ll wrap it and head back to L.A. I’ll leave you out of it.”

“Thanks, Tom. My client’s here. See you later.”

Tom got dressed and combed his hair, his stomach growling—he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, just coffee to keep him going.

What the hell was he doing here? Jimmy was an inconsiderate bastard who put Ann through hell, and he probably got what was coming. 

Homesickness hit hard, yearning for L.A.’s sun and familiar faces. He was about to pack it all in when the phone rang.

“Tom, it’s Mike Fox. We need to talk.”

“Hello, Mike. Talk about what? I don’t have much.”

“Well, I’m dropping in on Carmine tomorrow. I’ve had a plainclothes man shadowing Ann since this went down. Carmine was in for a manicure today, and other than the pizzeria, she hasn’t been with the kid. I want you to hear what he says.”

“Just tell me when, and I’ll be at your office,” Tom replied.

“Carmine rolls into the club around noon. Meet me at eleven. We’ll try to make sense of this mess.”

“I’ll be there,” Tom said, hanging up.

Tom leaned back on the bed, staring at the ceiling fan’s lazy spin, mirroring the muddled thoughts churning in his head.
Everything was back on the table. 

Unfortunately, the questions outnumbered the answers two to one.
Why hadn’t Ann mentioned Carmine’s manicure? And why hadn’t Jerry been staying over, especially now with Jimmy gone? 

What Tom knew for sure was that everyone came off devious. He was swimming in half-truths and hidden agendas.

He decided to stick it out the two weeks. No longer for Jimmy or Ann. Because he felt played for a fool, somehow being used.

He’d drop by Ann’s to grab the numbers of Jimmy’s nurse girlfriends, then hit the hospital. But he couldn’t mention Carmine to her—risking she’d tip him off.

Jerry had professed love for Ann, all charm and charisma. Maybe Tom’s gut reaction to the kid under the cemetery tree was spot on. Could Jerry be a decoy for Carmine, hiding a deeper tie to Ann? 

Those were the questions. What he needed were answers.

Tom needed a drink. The hotel lobby adjoined a tiny lounge—just a simple bar with three small tables pushed against the far wall.

The bartender was a woman about Tom’s age, her lined face suggesting she’d once mixed cocktails for classier crowds in fancier joints a lifetime ago. But here she was, pouring him a scotch and soda, offering a once-pretty visage for some harmless flirting.

“I get off at 2 a.m. I could drop by your room if you need company. Twenty bucks for the hour,” she murmured, leaning in close to his ear.

“It’s a tempting offer,” Tom replied, “but I’m here on business, and I work late. I’m enjoying your company, though.”

“Suit yourself, fella. Ten years ago, you couldn’t have afforded me,” she shot back, her voice laced with equal parts disappointment and melancholy.

He drained his drink and slid her a fin as a tip. “The offer still stands if you change your mind.”

“Hey, I just might take you up on that sometime.”

Tom left the bar and fired up his engine. He drove to Ann’s place to pick up the names and the picture, wary of whatever she might tell him.

He parked in front of Ann’s house and rang the bell. She cracked the door open barely halfway, leaning against it in a skimpy silk robe that left little to the imagination.

“I’d let you in, Tom, but it was a long day. Here are your names and the photo. Take a look at it.”

Tom pulled the photo from the envelope, one eye on the image and the other on Ann’s long bare legs.

“She’s pretty,” Ann said, her words slurring slightly—she’d obviously been drinking. “But she’s got nothing on me. Good luck with your investigation. Come see me before you leave.”

She shut the door, leaving Tom bewildered. She was becoming a complete enigma, and if her intention was to seem suspicious, it was working all too well.

Before heading to the hospital, he cruised past Marino’s Pizzeria. There was Jerry behind the counter with Tony, serving customers and twirling dough rounds.

Maybe Jerry was running cover for Carmine—or maybe he was being strung along, just like Tom felt he was.

He realized he’d never really gotten to know Ann; the only time he’d met her before now was at the wedding. Jimmy had portrayed her as an innocent neighborhood girl, but she was obviously a match for him—maybe even more so. Tom was learning that the hard way, and fast.

Chapter Seven

Around 11 p.m., a knock echoed at Ann’s apartment door. Unlike with Tom, she swung it wide, welcoming her lover with a deep kiss on the mouth.

She still wore the silk robe that had driven Tom to distraction. She threw her arms around his neck, pulling him close, nipping at his ear.
When the robe slipped to the floor, she stood naked beneath it. At forty, she kept her girlish figure—belly flat enough to bounce a quarter off, breasts he could nearly fit in his mouth.

The feel of his muscular shoulders thrilled Ann. They recalled Jimmy’s, but stronger, unlike the thin, wiry kid Jerry.

Carmine Perro was no kid; he was all man. He lifted her naked body, her thighs wrapping around his waist as she thrust her tongue deep into his mouth.

He carried her to the bedroom and tossed her onto the unmade bed. What started as a deal to square Jimmy’s gambling debts had twisted into a passion neither could define.

Tom’s thoughts lingered on Ann as he drove up Fort Hamilton Parkway toward Maimonides Hospital. She’d looked stunning in that silk robe at the door—teasing him on purpose, he figured, but why?

He cranked the radio. Mel Allen was wrapping up another Yankee win. Tom had grown up a fan. Baseball pulled his focus back to the job at hand.

At the front desk, the clerk pointed him to the security office, a door adjacent to the elevator bay. It stood ajar. A guy about Tom’s age, a little older sat at a desk, wrapping up a call.

“I’ll be right with you,” the man said, hand over the mouthpiece.

Tom dropped into a chair beside the desk. The office looked like a typical NYC precinct—green and blue paint peeling on steel desks and chairs, all no-nonsense edge.

The man hung up and eyed Tom. “Mr. Dukes. How can I help?”

Tom flashed his private investigator badge. “Tom Hart. Good friend of Jimmy Grillo’s. I’m looking into his murder for his wife.”

“Tom Hart,” Dukes said, nodding. “Detective Fox said you’d drop by. Worked twenty years at the 69th before retiring. Been here five.”

Tom shook his hand and pulled out the envelope Ann had given him at the door.
Dukes scanned the three names and the photo of the blonde.

“Yeah, all nurses here. The blonde is Celia Jorgensen, married to oncologist Dr. Vic Jorgensen. They were into some kinky stuff with Jimmy. A cleaning lady walked in on Celia giving him head in an empty operating room while the Doc watched, whacking himself off. She reported it to us. Word against word. I told them if anything was going on, take it off hospital grounds—or next time, it wouldn’t be just an accusation.”

“How about the other nurses?” Tom asked.

“Rumors only. Two are married, the other fresh out of college. Word is Jimmy used the O.R. more than the surgeons did. No complaints, though.”

“Can I talk to the Jorgensens?” Tom asked.

“Celia’s on duty. The Doc works days. He came in on his own time for that alleged fling in the O.R.”

“What floor is she on, and when’s her break?” Tom asked.

“Seventh floor, infectious diseases,” Dukes said. “Night shift’s usually slow. I’ll walk up and introduce you. Mike Fox already talked to her and the Doc. Haven’t heard from him since, so he probably didn’t think much of it.”

They rode the elevator to seven. Celia was leaning over a medicine cart, dividing pills for patients. Dukes approached with Tom and introduced them.

“Nurse Jorgensen, this is Tom Hart, a private investigator working the Jimmy Grillo murder. He’d like a word.”

Her eyes welled up immediately. She set down a bottle of pills and nodded. 

“Sure,” she said, directing them to the nurses’ lounge.

“First off, Nurse Jorgensen, I was a boyhood pal of Jimmy’s,” Tom said. “His wife’s upset over the murder and asked me to get to the bottom of it.”

She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue, crying softly. “Call me Celia. Jimmy was a very good friend of ours. We loved him and miss him terribly.”

“You say ‘ours.’ You and your husband?”

“Yes, me and Vic. We’ve had him at our home. It was an intimate friendship. We miss him so much.”

“Celia, I have to ask this as respectfully as possible,” Tom said. “Were you and your husband Jimmy’s lovers?”

“I was Jimmy’s lover,” she said. “Vic just liked to watch and pleasure himself. He’d join in sometimes, but they’d both make love to me, not each other.”

“Did your husband ever get jealous or angry about seeing you, his wife, with another man?”

“Of course not,” she said. “Vic encourages me to have other lovers, as long as he’s present. We’ve been into this since before we married.”

“And you, Celia? Ever jealous of Jimmy’s wife, take it out on him?”

“Oh, never,” she said, wiping tears from her cheeks. “I loved Jimmy more than the others. He was special to Vic and me. We thought the world of him.”

Tom and Dukes exchanged a glance, shaking their heads.

“Celia, thanks for your time. You answered everything. I’ll let you know if I need more. I’d like to speak to Dr. Jorgensen tomorrow. Here’s my number—have him call in the morning?”

“I will,” she said with a sad smile. “Hope I helped.”

Dukes and Tom spoke to the other three nurses. The two married ones insisted they were just friends. The younger one admitted she and Jimmy met in a hotel a couple times, but it ended there. Tom jotted it all in his notepad and returned to Dukes’s office with him.

“So, what do you think?” Dukes asked.

“We didn’t hear anything that points to murder,” Tom said. “Celia was the most salacious, but she was transparent. I don’t think she was lying.”

“Well talk to Dr. Jorgensen, and you’ll have done your due diligence,” Dukes said. “He’s a respected specialist—a genius. Saves lives, important ones. Hard to pin it on him without concrete evidence, no matter their lifestyle.”

“I know. Dukes,” Tom said, extending his hand. “I’ve got less than two weeks to figure this out before heading back to L.A. And it’s getting messier, not cleaner.”

“Well, keep plugging till then,” Dukes said. “Takes one small break to topple the whole house of cards. We’ve seen it a million times.”

Tom took his leave and headed back to the hotel. It was ten minutes to two. He stuck his head in the lounge and saw his bartender friend wiping down the bar with a damp towel.

He pulled up a stool and sat his tired, lonely ass down. He opened his mouth to say something, but she placed her index finger on his lips.

“No need to say anything. I had a feeling you’d be back. Let’s go to your room. Ten years ago, you couldn’t afford me. But tonight, I’m yours for a twenty.”

Chapter Eight

The bartender didn’t linger for cuddling. Wham, bam, thank you, ma’am—that’s all Tom’s twenty bucks bought, and that suited him fine.

After she left, he showered, scrubbing off the emotional grime that had clung to him since landing at LaGuardia.

The next morning, his phone’s ring jolted him awake. He rolled over to grab it, the nightstand clock reading 8:57 a.m.

“Hello,” Tom grunted, voice thick with sleep.

“Good morning. Dr. Jorgensen here. My wife said you wanted to talk.”

“Yes, Doctor. I’m Tom Hart, private investigator, working Jimmy Grillo’s murder. Can we meet this afternoon?”

“My schedule’s packed. Meet me in the hospital lobby at eight tonight. We’ll talk then.”

“You got it, Doctor. See you there.”

Tom had to meet Detective Mike Fox at his office at eleven a.m. Mike seemed hot on Carmine Perro—maybe the stakeout on Ann’s place had turned up something.

He’d be cautious about what to share and what to hold back. Fox would press for what Tom learned from Celia, which wasn’t much—just that she had deep feelings for Jimmy and was taking his death hard.

Fresh from the shower, Tom realized he hadn’t shaved yesterday. He grabbed his razor and went over his face twice, scraping clean. He dressed, combed his hair neatly, needing to look sharp, if only for himself. Loneliness hit hard. Even Ann felt different now, untrustworthy.

The pull of L.A. gnawed at him. He had to look out for himself, stay focused on the job, one step at a time.

Tom parked off 64th Street by 16th Avenue, a three-block walk to the precinct. The cool morning air got his blood pumping and loosened his mood.

He pulled open the precinct door and headed straight to Fox’s office.

“Tom, take a seat. Coffee?” Mike said.

“Yeah, thanks.” Tom poured a cup from the pot—dark and scalding.

“My guy watching Ann’s place says Carmine’s dropping by regularly now,” Mike said. 

“Spent the night twice in a row. Looks like a love affair.”

“Jesus, Mike, I don’t know what to think anymore,” Tom said. “I thought I knew Jimmy, and Ann by extension, but the Jimmy I knew died years ago. This Jimmy was a sexual deviant, and maybe Ann’s cut from the same cloth.”

“Easy, Tom,” Mike said. “You’re doing this for the Jimmy you knew, your boyhood pal, not what he became.”

“You’re right,” Tom said. “Still, I can’t wait to get back to L.A. Anyway, I spoke with Celia Jorgensen yesterday with your friend Dukes. She’s half nymphomaniac, half basket case. Started bawling when we mentioned Jimmy. It was a twisted setup with her, Jimmy, and her husband. The Jimmy I went to war with wouldn’t have recognized this one.”

“Think the husband got jealous and decided to end it for good?” Mike asked.

“Possible,” Tom said. “But Celia made it sound like they were all playing parts in some kinky sex game. I think they’re both sorry it’s over. I’m meeting the doctor tonight. We’ll see what he says.”

“This thing with Carmine’s complicated,” Mike said. “Probably been going on a while. Maybe Ann offered herself to keep Carmine from hurting Jimmy, and sparks flew.”

“If they fell in love, that’s a big motive for Carmine to knock Jimmy off,” Tom said. “What about Jerry, the kid?”

“A couple of Carmine’s goons, Al and Cowboy, took him to the back alley the night before you talked to him,” Mike said. “My guy followed. They didn’t work him over, just slapped him around. He hasn’t seen Ann since.”

“So Carmine’s our prime suspect for now,” Tom said, rubbing his chin nervously.

“Carmine and Ann,” Mike replied. “It’s noon. Time to hit the club and shake Carmine’s confidence.”

Mike drove from the precinct to the club on 66th Street, parking out front. He banged on the steel door, hard and long.

“Who the hell’s banging on my door?” shouted Al, Carmine’s hulking bodyguard.

Mike shoved his badge in Al’s face as the door opened, pushing past him. Cowboy, the other goon, stood behind the bar, same as last time Tom was there.

“You two, outside,” Mike ordered. “We’re talking to your boss alone.”

Al and Cowboy glanced at Carmine, waiting for his word.

“It’s okay, boys,” Carmine said coolly. “We got nothing to hide. Take a break.”

As Al and Cowboy shuffled out, Tom caught Cowboy’s stride—slightly bowlegged, like Jenny Miscussa described the killer.

“Have a seat at my table,” Carmine said, gesturing.

“What’s going on with you and Jimmy’s widow, Perro?” Mike asked.

“You mean my girlfriend, Ann,” Carmine said. “We made it official last night. Two consenting adults. Nothing to hide.”

“How about hiding that you had one of those goons crack Jimmy with a crowbar to clear the field?” Mike said.

“That marriage was dead anyway,” Carmine said. “Jimmy was a filthy pervert. Ann would’ve left him regardless.”

“So, was it a thousand or a hundred? Who’s lying, you or her?” Tom asked.

“Neither,” Carmine said. “Jimmy told her it was a grand to hide his debt. She was helping pay it off, and he was pocketing what she gave him.”

“You’ve got all the answers, don’t you, Perro?” Mike said.

“That’s how it works, right? You ask, I answer,” Carmine said. “And call me Carmine—no need to be so formal.”

“Maybe it was a thousand, and you arranged for Ann to pay you off in kind,” Tom said, locking eyes with him.

“Vivid imagination,” Carmine said. “Got proof?”

“I could drag you and those two in right now,” Mike said. “But we’re watching you. We’ve got a witness. Timing’s not right yet.”

“You’ve got nothing because I did nothing,” Carmine said. “The DA’s pushing you to close this as a mugging gone bad, which it probably is. Keep watching me.”

“Let’s go, Tom,” Mike said.

They climbed into Mike’s car and peeled out.

“He’s right, Mike. We’ve got theories and accusations, nothing solid. But Jenny told me the killer was bowlegged.”

“Bowlegged like Cowboy?” Mike said. “We could run him in now. Got a witness who can point him out if we make him walk for her.”

“Hold off,” Tom said. “Jenny’s scared stiff. She told me in confidence—she’d deny it if we pushed her to testify.”

“Well, we know it now,” Mike said. “Carmine had Cowboy kill Jimmy to clear the way for Ann. Clean and simple.”

“No proof yet,” Tom said. “We could drag Ann out of the beauty parlor, haul her to the precinct in cuffs, give her an old-fashioned interrogation. Show her what life with Carmine’ll be like.” His voice dripped with frustration.

“Let’s sleep on that,” Mike said. “You’re meeting the doctor tonight. Follow through. That’s good police work. Call me tomorrow, and we’ll bring her in like you said.”

At eight o’clock, Tom waited in the Maimonides Hospital lobby for Dr. Victor Jorgensen, whose wife, Celia, he’d questioned yesterday.

He had a clear view of the elevator. By 8:15, Tom was restless. He didn’t want to be here, didn’t care much about the case anymore. Ann, once his reason for digging, was now a prime suspect.

The elevator doors parted, and a man in a full-length white lab coat strode toward Tom.

“Dr. Jorgensen?” Tom asked.

“Yes. You must be Tom Hart, the P.I. from Los Angeles I spoke with this morning.”

“That’s me,” Tom said.

“Follow me. There’s a conference room we can use—more private.”

Jorgensen led Tom past a second bank of elevators and the gift shop.

“In here,” Jorgensen said, opening a door. “Never used this time of day. At least not for official business.” He chuckled softly.

“What’s it used for then?” Tom asked, playing along.

“Some folks use it for pleasure, not work, during off hours.”

“Is that what you and your wife did with Jimmy?” Tom asked. “Grab a conference room, do your thing, you watch?”

“Pretty much,” Jorgensen said. “Lots of fun. You should try it sometime.”

“I’ll pass, Doc,” Tom said. “Might’ve tempted me twenty years ago, but not now.”

“That’s why we do it,” Jorgensen said. “Keeps us young, you know.”

“Your wife kept saying she loved Jimmy,” Tom said. “Called him a gorgeous man, great lover, well-endowed. How’d that make you feel, Doc? Jealous? Angry?”

“It’s turning me on, detective,” Jorgensen said. “I’m calling Celia to invite a friend over tonight.”

Tom studied his eyes, searching for guilt or nerves. Nothing—just lust and depravity. A definite sicko, but a murderer? Hard to say.

“Thanks for your time, Doctor,” Tom said. “Pleasure meeting you and Mrs. Jorgensen.”

“You’re welcome, detective. I’ll pass that along to Celia upstairs.”

Tom walked out, double-timing it to his car. He’d done his due diligence, as Mike had said. It left a sour taste, seeing the degenerates Jimmy ran with.

1nkerdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nkerdg/my_neighbors_house_vanished_last_night_replaced/,My neighbor’s house vanished last night. Replaced by a copy?,"It happened around 1:13AM

I was smoking outside my duplex, kind of close to the road so I could get a better view of the moon that night. It was a bright waning crescent.

All of the houses were dark little silhouettes. The suburbs’ streetlamps gently coated our neighborhood road in pale yellow. The only lit house was at the bottom of the hill. The Moretti mansion.

I don’t know who the Morettis were, but they often had acquaintances visiting from out of town. Family parties. That sort of thing.

From my distance as their nearest neighbor, I could just barely make out the mansion’s windows. Blurry meshes of people mingling at some kind of late night soiree.

I remember savoring my smoke, thinking about how nice it must be to have such a close-knit family, and wondering what kind of Italian food the Morettis could have been sharing, when all of a sudden … *FLASH.*

*Blinding* *white tendrils of light,* they erupted from the mansion’s middle like a burst of ball lightning.

Or the birth of a star.

My entire body flinched. I braced myself against the nearest mailbox, and before I could even halfway begin to understand what was going on, the bright light vanished.

And so did every single person inside the house.

It was quite alarming to say the least. 

Only the building remained, with all of its indoor lamps now illuminating barren doorways, empty patios, and unoccupied floors. Every single person was gone.  It's like some unknowable thing had hit ‘delete’ on everyone inside.

The cigarette fell right out of my mouth.

I sprinted to my own house and grabbed binoculars from the front closet. After running down the street to get a better vantage, my binoculars told me what my eyes already knew.

All the people at the Moretti’s were truly gone. 

*Gone* gone.

And not even just their lively conversations and selves, but all the cars in the house’s driveway were gone too. All of the coatracks inside, empty. In fact, most of the furnishings inside the house appeared missing. I could only make out bare white walls. No paintings. No calendars. No clocks. 

*The whole thing had been gutted clean.* 

I must have spied on the place for about twenty minutes, tiptoeing closer, and then edging back when I lost my nerve. It was hard to know what I was supposed to do.

Waking up my wife, and getting her to run to the middle of the street felt like a pretty ridiculous proposition … but I needed someone else to see it. 

I needed to convince myself I wasn’t crazy.

Half-dazed and with her sleeping mask still on her forehead, Amy begrudgingly agreed to come take a look. But when I tried to point out the glowing, empty house down at the bottom of the hill, I was suddenly pointing at darkness. 

Their lights had turned off. 

You couldn’t really make out any of the house innards or surroundings anymore.

Amy was confused.

I angled her binoculars and tried to point at the lack of furniture and life inside.

“They’re asleep,” Amy groaned. “Their lights are off. What are you talking about?”

I did my best to explain what had happened, but Amy was tired.

We went back to bed.

\*\*\*

The next day, after dropping Amy off at work, the first thing I did was drive back to the Moretti mansion.

Strangely, in the morning light things looked normal.

I slowly drove down to the end of the cul-de-sac, and I could see an old Cadillac parked in the Moretti driveway. Through the kitchen windows, I spotted a couple family members gathering for some kind of breakfast or lunch.

It wasn't empty at all. 

I pulled a big U-turn at the end of the road, driving fairly slow. In my rear view mirror I watched the house to see if anyone twisted their head in my direction. 

No one did.

Because I was curious, I pulled another u-turn and drove right back towards the mansion. 

None of the profiles in the kitchen seemed to care.

I drove a donut. Just sort of absent-mindedly kept my wheel turned left and drove at 5 mph, watching the Moretti house to see if they would react.

They didn't.

I gave a honk. 

Two honks. 

Three.

Not a single person in the house seemed to be disturbed.

*Okay…*

I parked my car, and stood at the end of their driveway. Through the neighborhood silence, I could hear some faint voices inside the house immersed in conversation. A *tink!* from someone dropping cutlery on a plate.

*How is this possible? How can I hear them from out here … and yet … they can’t hear me out here?*

What may have been against my better judgement, I walked through their front gate, drifted up their little brick path, and knocked on the mahogany door. Three solid *whaps.*

I really didn’t have anything to say, other than ‘*did something happen last night?’* or ‘*Is everything okay?’*  But I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.

Ten requisite seconds went by. 

Then thirty. 

And then: footsteps.

The door opened about a handswidth. A gold chain went taught at the top of the crack. 

“Vai via subito!” A large Italian barked at me. “You going to do this everyday?”

I took a few steps back. “I’m sorry, what?”

“Per carità.” The man slapped his forehead. “I don’t want to see you here again. You understand?”

I shrunk away, really confused. “Sorry sorry. I just thought that … “

“We call cops! Go away!” He yelled, slamming the door.

I staggered back with my hands up. 

My stagger quickly turned into a stumble. My stumble turned into a trip. And then I sailed right into the Morettis’ Cadillac...

But instead of colliding with cold hard metal and breaking my nose, I kept falling until my ass hit concrete. And *only concrete.*

I rubbed my backside. *What the hell?*

Right beside me, the Cadillac was still parked. My chin maybe two feet away from its door handle.

I reached to touch the black shiny handle and witnessed my fingers *travel through* the metal … like it wasn’t really there. 

*What?*

I swatted my other hand reflexively, and watched it *phase through the tire.*

*First the house, and now this?*

Through the front window, I could still see the family sitting down for a meal around their dining room. A mother, a grandma, and perhaps three children. None of them were reacting to my fall. Or my earlier knocking.

Everyone seemed to be on a sort of ‘autopilot’.

And their car wasn’t even real.

*What. The. Fuck.*

Without a second to lose, I bolted back to my vehicle and tore up the street. A raw, all-pervading chill clenched my shoulders and neck. 

It had been a long time since I had felt that frightened.

*That* frightened.

\*\*\*

Amy was worn out from a full day of nursing. She was stuck in that delightful in-between state of being exhausted but still running on coffee jitters.

I promised I wouldn’t disturb her sleep again like last night, and made us a simple pasta dinner.

Over the course of our meal, I tried to keep the subject on all the writing I was trying to accomplish (I’m a teacher, and I was on my summer break), but of course, three bites in, I couldn’t help but share all the disquieting blips in reality down the road.

Amy was dubious. 

“You think the Moretti house was *replaced* last night?”

“Yes. I think there's some kind of elaborate effort to make the house *appear* normal from the outside. But it's not the same house any more.”

Amy took a long sip of her wine. “Okay...”

“So I think I should reach out to the Neighborhood Watch people. Or the police, or maybe the fire department. I should tell someone.”

Although my wife was generally polite, her exhaustion had carved her words rather pointed. “Milton. No one is going to believe you.”

“What?”

“Because I don’t believe you.”

“You don’t?”

“Last night when you showed me the mansion, everyone was asleep. And today it sounds like you were yelled at by an Italian guy. And then bonked your head on his car.”

“But I’m telling you I *didn’t* bonk my head. *The car was like a mirag*e — I fell right through it!”

“Yes, but that’s … Come on Milton, that’s ridiculous.”

“But it’s true! I’m telling you. I’ll take you there tomorrow. I can show you.”

“Milton. No.”

“What?”

“I don’t want to go there, I don't want people to think we’re crazy.”

“Well we have to do *something* about it.”

Amy tilted her gaze. “Do we?”

“Don’t we?”

She twirled a long piece of spaghetti and watched it curl over itself like a yarn ball. “Last December in E-Ward we had a pair of hikers explore a cave they weren't supposed to—they both needed ventilators. And just last week, we had a senior resident decide it would be a fun idea to try his grandson's skateboard. Broke his ribs and collar.”

“I don’t understand.”

“*Some things should be left well enough alone*. Whatever delusion you're having, just ignore it. You’re probably seeing things.”

“Seeing things?”

“Milton. Last night you dragged my ass out of bed to point at a dark mansion. I got two hours sleep and—”

“—I know, and I’m sorry about that, but I swear I still saw—”

“—and just *why* the hell were you out that late?”

I bit my lip. 

The truth was, my writing wasn't going great. I didn’t even have a name for the project. A good working title could have been *Writer's Block & Nighttime Cigarettes*.

“Amy, I was doing story stuff in my head, I find it easier outside when I’m stuck.”

“Yeah well, the rest of us still work in the morning.”

“I know.”

“Because the rest of society still needs to function. So maybe don’t wake us up with your nicotine-fuelled creative writing hallucinations. So maybe that, okay?”

I rolled up some spaghetti and took a bite.

I wasn't going to push it.

Amy was tired.

This was going to be my own thing.

\*\*\*

We tried to veg out like a normal couple, so we watched a quick episode of “The Office” before bed, Steve Carrell’s droll dialogue always worked like a Pavlovian bell for sleepy time. At least it did for Amy. 

My mind was still racing on my pillow. I was second-guessing myself more and more.

*Am I going crazy?*

*Is it day-time dreaming?*

*Does schizophrenia run in my family?*

No. What I saw was real. I know it was.

What I should have done is *recorded* any one of the strange blips with my phone. I could have easily recorded my hand swatting through the hologram car.

*That's exactly it.* *Evidence like that would be irrefutable.*

And so, around a quarter past two, I slipped out of bed, put on my jacket and marched into the warm July night.

Was I being impulsive? Yes.

Was I being stupid? Probably.

But since sleep wasn't on the menu, I knew I would feel so much better if I got a video to prove to myself … that I wasn't going insane.

\*\*\*

It was particularly dark out.

The sky was a moonless blanket of velvet smothering our suburb’s meek yellow streetlights. My old Canon lens hardly reflected anything.

 I figured a camera with a proper lens couldn’t hurt. And I was right, because almost immediately, I noticed the Moretti house was *lit.* 

Their parlour was aglow with the silhouettes of many guests.

When I was halfway down the hill, I stealthily snapped some photos. Videos.

it had the vibes of a late, after hours party. Guests were all either leaning, or sitting, each with a wineglass in hand. I couldn't spot the same family members that I saw in the morning, but it's possible they were out of view.

I snuck along the shadows until I reached the Moretti front yard. My plan was to record my palm phasing through the Cadillac. 

But as soon as I got closer, I could see *there was no Cadillac.*

*Wasn’t there a car there a second ago?*

I took a long sober stare as I reached their property line. 

Nope. No cars at all. 

*Great, I thought*. *Maybe I am going crazy.* 

And so I hit record on my camera, and held it at waist height.

*I’m going to capture everything from here on out.*

I stood. I stared. I waited. For way too long.

It was close to three in the morning. I was in all dark clothes. If I tried to get any closer to the house, someone could very well think I’m a burglar.

*But could they even see me?*

I walked closer, lowered my camera, and clapped my hands.

No reaction.

I smacked the railing along their fence which made a loud, metal *twang.*

No reaction. Nothing. 

It was the same as before. As if the people inside the building were all either unilaterally deaf or on some kind of bizarre autopilot. 

*Okay*, I thought. *Same unprovable situation. Fuck.* 

*What am I doing here?*

*I should just go.*

*I should just go right?*

And I almost turned to leave…

But then I proceeded to grip the railing, hop the fence, flank the house, and enter the backyard.

*No. There's got to be something. People have to know about this.*

*\*\*\**

It was a strange, overly busy garden, one that you’d probably need a team of landscapers for. There were birdbaths, trellises and long green vines snaking across wooden arches. I quickly ran my hand along nearby leaves and bushes, filming myself, checking to see if all of this was real.

I touched a flowerpot.

Nudged a shovel.

They all had the touch and feel of dense, actual things.

I could still see the guests inside from the back window and watched the same after hours party seemingly stuck on repeat.

*What am I supposed to do? Sneak in? Catch them unawares?*

I kept recording my hand as it touched things in the garden. Watching through the little viewfinder. Hunting anomalies.

There was a marble statue of a male figure in the middle of the yard. It looked like something hauled out of Rome. 

I tapped the statue's chest and quickly discovered my first anomaly.

It felt hot. 

The texture was hard to describe. 

Like freshly printed paper.

I delicately touched the statue again, leaning into its strange heat. On camera, I was able to capture my finger making a very slight indentation in the middle of its solar plexus.

And then, before I could pull back — *the statue grabbed my throat.*

Quick, impervious arms enwrapped me. 

The chokehold was so tight, it hurt to draw breath. 

The camera fell out of my hands. 

The statue started to walk. 

*The statue started to walk?*

I was forced to follow. My toes barely touching the Earth. It heaved me across the garden. My camera swayed along its strap, aimed at the ground. 

The back doors of the Mansion opened on their own. 

“*Gah!”*  I wheezed out. *“Gyeuh!”*

The statue steered me with its arms. Its hot fingers could easily crush my throat.

It marched me inside the Moretti house where I could see something was wrong.

Very wrong.

Instead of furniture and Italian decor, the entire inside was *white grids.* Each of the ceilings, walls and floors were all composed of small white squares with faint blue outlines. 

Like graph paper from math class. 

Without ceremony, the statue let me go onto the middle of the floor. My knees shot out in pain.  

I scrambled up to run, but the door behind us sealed shut. Now the entire space was doorless. Windowless. Everything felt unnaturally lit by these grids.

I glanced at my hand. It was evenly lit from all sides. No shadows anywhere.

*Where the fuck am I?*

Out from a hidden corner, more statues appeared.

Some of their body types corresponded with the party guests I had seen earlier. Except they clearly weren’t human guests. They were just smooth, marble-white copies of the guests.

“Please! Don’t hurt me!” My words echoed through the grid-room. There was something terrifyingly *infinite* about this space.

A white statue with a large gut and pudgy face came up to me. I realized it had the *exact* same shape and stature of the Italian man who yelled at me. Despite his face having no texture, I could still see the template lips curve into a smile. 

“You do not belong here.” His previous accent had disappeared. It was like some cosmic text-to-speech machine was feeding him words.

“No.I  don’t.” I whispered. “Please don’t hurt me..”

The pudgy template man shrugged. A feminine template in the back asked: “why would we hurt you?”

I recoiled, moving away from all of them. My hands touched the hot, papery grid walls. I tried to slink away.

“We would never hurt you.”

“You are one of us.”

“We would never hurt you.”

I reached a corner of the house, and suddenly the white tiles developed color.

Like a growing stain, the entire space started rendering a wooden floor, brown baseboards, and cream wallpaper.

*No… but this is…*

In two more blinks of an eye, I was standing in my own hallway. I could see my Costco calendar hung above the stairway. I recognized my slippers on the floor.

*No no no… this isn’t right…*

I was suddenly outside of my bedroom. I clawed at the handle and opened the door, looking for a way out of this.

And of course, that’s where I saw it.

There, lying in bed, was a perfect white template model … resembling Amy.

In about half a second, her pajamas and skin tone rendered into place. She yawned, stirred a little, and looked up at me.

“Milton?”

I bolted away and explored the rest of the house. It was all too familiar.

Down to apples in the fridge and mouse droppings behind my couch, this was an exact replica of the duplex I had lived in for the last six years.

“Everything okay?” Amy called.

\*\*\*

I told her that I was shaken by a nightmare. And in a sense, I wasn't lying.

This was a nightmare.

Everything I had ever known was some kind of farce. Some kind of simulation I didn't understand.

Even when I left my house to inspect outside, I was still on top of the hill, looking *down* at the Moretti mansion. It’s like I had teleported. It’s like reality had rearranged itself to fool me.

I didn't want Amy to think I was even more unhinged than before.

So I told her nothing.

I couldn’t trust her anyway. *Was she even real?*

It was too big of a madness to share with anyone. So I kept it to myself.

For weeks I’ve kept this to myself.

\*\*\*

I’ve gone through phases where I’ve just laid in bed at home, pretending to be sick, unable to process what I had seen.

*The template people and their white grid world are behind everything.* I couldn’t get it out of my head.

My pretend-wife asked about my upcoming pretend-job teaching pretend-children, and I gave a pretend-answer: “Yes, I’m looking forward to sculpting some new minds this year.”

*But aren’t their minds already sculpted? Isn’t everything already pre-rendered and determined somehow? Isn’t everything just a charade?*

\*\*\*

There were nights where I tried to peel back the skin on my arms. Just to see if there was any white, papery marble inside of me too. 

I couldn’t find anything. Only blood and pain.

For a time, I used to keep my camera on my desk as a reminder—to keep myself sober about these events. 

I had never once watched the footage from my encounters that night. But I knew the truth was recorded on a little SD card in my Canon DLSR.

And then one morning … I deleted the footage.

I deleted the footage without ever having reviewed it.

I deleted the only piece of evidence I had.

\*\*\*

Months have gone by and now I’m back teaching at school.

All the peachy, fresh-skinned faces, and all the tests and homework to review, and all the dumb Gen Z jokes flying over my head — it all forged into a nice, wonderful reminder that life needs distractions.

That we should keep ourselves busy being social, and surrounded by others.

Distractions are good. They’re great in fact.

\*\*\*

Most recently, I’ve broken through my writer’s block. I think it's helped to write this whole story out so I could get it out of my system.

The key was finding the right title. Once I had the title, everything just started to flow.

*“Some Things Should Be Left Well Enough Alone.”*

It’s got that great, guiding principle *feel* to it. I’ve been repeating it back to Amy almost every day like a mantra. It helps me get by.

They’re words to live by, I say.

""Whatever your words are, your silence is mine.""

I heard this phrase in a song, and I smiled. How beautiful. How delicate and yet powerful to describe love that way. No matter how many times I hear it, it makes me stop for a second. It makes me smile every single time.

How beautiful it is to say that someone’s silence is yours.

I think that’s why it hit me so deeply, because I resonated with it in a way I can’t explain. For the longest time, I thought the raging kind of love was the most beautiful. I thought that was what I wanted. A love that burned, that was wild and loud and full of roaring butterflies. But recently I’ve realized, isn’t it just as beautiful, maybe even more so, to have a relationship that is soft?

The kind of love where the silence feels like a warm hug. Where their presence alone makes you feel safe. That, to me, feels more vulnerable, more honest. Like placing my own hands over my ears when I’m overwhelmed, that small action that quiets everything for just a moment. That is what this soft kind of love feels like.

What I mean by soft is that silent, grounding kind of love. The one where you see them and can’t help but smile. Where you talk about mundane, everyday things and it still feels special. Where just being in their presence makes you feel like your feet are on the ground again.

Where there is this silence that is so beautiful it quiets down the noise in your head. Where their silence belongs to you. More than their words, more than anything they could say, it’s their silence, their smile, their hug, their space. It’s the feeling of your own hand over your ears, muffling the chaos of the world.

It’s the silent walks with little giggles in between. It’s the vulnerability. The quiet understanding when you don’t feel like sharing something and they simply let you be. It’s the respect for individuality, the unspoken promise that you are still your own person. It’s the silence that feels like a hug, that doesn’t look loud or passionate to anyone else but is somehow the most beautiful thing in the world.

It’s not about relying on them for your happiness, but knowing that they’re there, like a hand over your ears on a bad day, a cup of coffee when you’re stressed, a light, happy walk when you’re in a good mood. It’s a sigh at the end of the day. It’s like the tree outside your house that you glance at every day and think, “How beautiful.” It’s the sound of waves that calm everything inside you.

I think that’s what love should be. At least to me.

Realizing this recently made me a little less miserable. For so long I thought I was craving passion, fireworks, loudness, but maybe that was never what I wanted at all. And somehow, just knowing that this is the kind of love I truly want has made me feel lighter. I don’t know why, I don’t know how, but even if I never find it, at least I’ll know what I was looking for.

And that, strangely enough, feels like peace.

1nkeqv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1nkeqv8/parents_are_nice_but_probably_emotionally/,Parents are nice but (probably) emotionally neglectful?,"I (F24) never considered that my parents might be emotionally neglectful. They don't fit that stereotype. They're progressive and overall quite nice people (according to my stereotypes anyway). My friends and partners always think they're great, which in many ways they are.

Still, I have always wondered why my brother and I are so secretive and unwilling to share things between ourselves and with others (and with our parents). 

Why I have always found it near impossible to talk about my emotions without crying. Why it's hard for me to say, and being told, ""I love you"".

I talked to my boyfriend recently about a tough decision he has to make, and he told me that he asked his parents for advice and that they had been really helpful; that he'd come to a decision and now felt much better. 

Hearing this made me feel angry, which really surprised me. I told him that I thought it seemed a bit silly and immature to go to your parents for life advice. He told me parents ""hold a lot of wisdom"" and that I ""should try it."" I could not imagine anything more outlandish, which, when I thought about it, seemed kind of strange? They're my parents after all.

Anyway, I moved back home after university and currently live with my parents.  
  
Just now I was crying in the kitchen (reason irrelevant). Noticeably crying. My mom (her home office is near the kitchen) could definitely hear it. She did not come out of the office, just kept typing away, for at least 15 minutes. My dad came down to get coffee and asked me ""what was wrong now."" I answered, and he told me that I should just do X to solve it and walked away. I then had an outburst and said something like, ""wow that's nice, just walk away while I'm crying."" He proceeded to walk away.

After a little while my mom came out (also to get smth). While she's a bit more sensitive, she, too, basically said I should just do this and that and left. No hugs or anything.

Anyway, as I've been reflecting on my parents and childhood lately, it struck me that this situation probably isn't normal, or healthy.

Some more ""strange"" things that come to mind:

\- I was obviously depressed as a teenager and cannot remember ever discussing this with my parents except for the time my mom set me up with a therapist (whom I stonewalled lol). There was also the time when they said they were ""worried about leaving me alone"" (headed to lake house), and that they should probably cancel. My memory (could be clouded) of this is that they made me feel guilty about ruining their outing (they ended up going after I protested).

\- Basically never acknowledging negative emotions. My dad or me might walk into the kitchen or living room noticeably upset or in a bad mood and no one would ever acknowledge it. No asking ""what's up"" or ""what's wrong,"" just look at the floor and ask the normal questions, e.g. ""amazing potatoes"" and ""can you pass the salt"" (except ""how was your day"" ofc).

\-  Apologizing indirectly (e.g. offering to give a ride, buying a snack I like) or simply moving on by never bringing up the argument/situation again.

\- Getting mad at me for expressing negative feelings (saying it's silly, that I'm exaggerating, or not grateful). 

Anyway, I don't think my parents are the most emotionally neglectful parents out there and definitely not the worst parents in the world. We can have fun together and love each other very much. I had a pretty good childhood. But I definitely think they fucked up in this respect and I'm only now realizing that their behavior isn't normal. I definitely have issues because of it.

For context, I'm from Sweden and my mom's side of the family are definitely rug sweepers deluxe. I didn't even know my grandmother had a brother until I was 15, when she told me that he died of cancer at 18 and that her parents never spoke of him after his passing (!!). My dad's side of the family is another can of worms.

I'm scared of becoming like them (I'm already like them in some ways, e.g. wanting to avoid making ""scenes"" with my boyfriend in public). Considering going to a therapist but I'm not sure if it would do me any good.

I just needed to get that off my chest.

Would love to hear from other people who grew up in similar situations (emotionally neglectful parents who still weren't the worst or absolutely horrible). What made you realize? Did you talk to your parents about it? How are you doing now?",5,1758216769.0,emotionalneglect,1,1.0,False

Back at his Bay Ridge hotel, Tom dialed Beth, his secretary, who was holding down the fort at his L.A. office, letting clients and prospects know he’d be out of town for a couple of weeks, dealing with a death in the family.

Beth’s voice, warm with a matronly grandmotherly calm, came through the line—a stark contrast to his last two hires: hotshot Doris, who’d stirred an unrequited ache in him, and psycho Madge, who’d tried to put him in the ground.

“Hey, Beth, how’s the home front?” Tom asked, settling onto the creaky hotel bed.

“Busy, boss,” Beth said. “I’m taking callback numbers. You’re losing business out there.”

“I hear you,” Tom said, his voice low. “Trying to tie up loose ends here. Brooklyn’s got its pull, but it’s also reminding me why I haven’t been back in twenty years.”

“I’m telling folks you’ll be back in a week or two. For ongoing cases, I said Sam Chandler’s pitching in.”

“Good work, Beth. I’m aiming for two weeks, tops. Not sure if I’m helping or just stirring up more trouble here.”

“Alright, boss. Other line’s flashing. That all?”

“Yeah, get that, Beth. Call me if anything urgent pops up.”

Tom leaned back on the hotel bed, eyes closed, the day’s weight pressing hard. When things didn’t add up, when confusion clouded his mind, that’s when a spark sometimes hit.

First, he’d track down Jenny Miscussa, the spinster. If she could describe the killer—height, distinctive gait, left- or right-handed—it might not name the bastard but could rule out others.

He also needed to corner Jerry, the kid, before Mike Fox got to him. Then hit Maimonides Hospital at midnight to grill Jimmy’s coworkers, see what they knew about his late-night habits.

Too much ground to cover, too little time. Two weeks felt right. Ann had nudged him to walk away, Mike and Monsignor Coffey saw his digging as meddling at best. Fine. If he couldn’t crack this case in fourteen days, he’d say goodbye to Ann, board a one-way flight to L.A., and leave Brooklyn in the rearview.

Tom reached Jenny Miscussa’s apartment building on 65th Street, facing a locked middle door that required a buzzer. He waited ten minutes for someone to come or go. When that didn’t happen, he started ringing bells. On the third try, a buzz granted him entry.
He climbed two flights to the third floor and rapped on Jenny’s door.

“Who’s there?” a woman’s voice snapped from the other side, curt and wary.

“Pharmacy. Delivery for Jenny Miscussa,” Tom said, taking a gamble. At her age, she was likely fixated on pills her doctor prescribed.

It worked. A chain slid free, two locks—a deadbolt and knob—clicked, and the door cracked open. Tom wedged his foot in.

“Where’s my medication?” Jenny asked, suspicion creeping into her voice.

“I’m a private investigator, working the Skull Murder case,” Tom said, his tone steady. “Word is you saw it happen.”

“I didn’t see anything. I was sleeping. Get out, or I’ll call the police!”

“Easy, Jenny,” Tom said. “The press is crawling all over this. If I get pinched, they’ll dig into why I was here. You want your name splashed on the front page with a killer on the loose?”

“No!” she cried, her voice breaking into soft sobs. “What do you want from me?”

“Just a couple questions, nothing wild,” Tom said. “Answer, and I’m gone. No one’ll know I was here.”

She opened the door wider, letting him into the foyer but no further, her arms crossed tight.

“Can you describe him—height, weight, did he walk funny, left- or right-handed? Tell me what you saw, and I’m out of here.”

Jenny trembled, but Tom’s calm, professional air steadied her. 

“He wasn’t tall—maybe five-nine,” she said. 
“Regina Pacis’s lights were on. The victim was heading toward 13th Avenue. The killer came from 12th, snuck up behind, and swung a crowbar—right-handed. When the man fell, the killer dropped the weapon and vanished up 12th toward 64th Street. He was slightly bowlegged, dressed all in black, a dark cap pulled low over his face. Couldn’t see it. Glad I didn’t. 
I’ll never forget that little dog’s cries, knowing its human was gone.” Her voice eased, unburdened by the secret.

“What’d you do next?” Tom asked.

“Called an ambulance, then went to bed,” she said. “Heard the sirens when the police arrived but stayed put. Didn’t want to see any more.”

“You did good, Jenny,” Tom said. “The victim, Jimmy, was my boyhood friend. I’m after justice for him. Thank you.”

“You promised not to tell the police,” she said, her voice quivering. “Please, I want to be left alone. I thought you had my heart medication. This excitement’s no good for me.”

“You have my word,” Tom said. “This stays between us. I’m leaving now.”

Tom slipped a fifty-dollar bill into Jenny’s hand and hustled down the stairs to his car. He needed a breather, so he stopped at J&V Pizza on 18th Avenue for a slice and a Pepsi.

It was early, so he settled for a reheated slice from yesterday. When the counter guy pulled it from the oven, the cheese and tomato sauce sizzled in perfect harmony. Even a day-old Brooklyn slice outshone anything in L.A.

Tom ate standing at a wall counter, mulling Jenny’s words. The killer—five-nine, right-handed, slightly bowlegged, dressed in black with a dark cap pulled low—knew Jimmy, had stalked him. Not a woman, but Ann had Jerry, and one of Jimmy’s nurses could have a jealous husband or boyfriend who took a crowbar to his skull. 
Average height, bowlegged, right-handed—not much, but more than he had.

The carb rush sharpened his mind, fueling him for the next move: confronting Jerry, Ann’s pizza boy. Tom chuckled, thinking he might’ve eaten free if he’d name-dropped Ann.

Marino’s Pizzeria was a long block away. He left his car on 64th Street and walked. Inside, Jerry and a short, chubby older man—worked the counter, tossing dough.

Tom knew Ann had probably prepped Jerry, so he’d need to tread lighter than with her. The kid would be on guard.

“Jerry,” Tom said, offering a handshake.

“Yeah,” Jerry replied, spinning a dough round, tossing it high, and catching it with both fists.

“I’m a friend of Ann’s and Jimmy’s, go way back to our kid days,” Tom said. “Private eye from L.A., trying to catch Jimmy’s killer.”

“Well, it ain’t Tony,” Jerry said with a laugh, nodding at his plump sidekick, who flashed an affectionate grin before kneading dough.

Jerry stepped from behind the counter and gestured to a table. “Ann said you’d probably show. Detective Fox was here last night. She told me to be straight with him. Didn’t need to—I got nothing to hide.”

“What’d you tell Fox?” Tom asked, wishing he’d beaten the cop to the punch.

“That I’m in love with Ann,” Jerry said. “We’ve been seeing each other a while, mostly nights when Jimmy was at work.”

“Good you were honest,” Tom said. “He’d have sniffed out any cover-up.”

“Jimmy was a customer,” Jerry went on. “Bought slices, talked Yankee baseball. Stopped coming in after I started with Ann. Figure he knew but never called me out. Probably ’cause he was messing around too.”

Tom saw why Ann fell for Jerry. The kid was genuine, his easy charm winning over even Tony, who shot him warm glances. Years of police work had honed Tom’s read on people—Jerry was the real deal.

“As for Fox, you’re likely not a suspect, but you’re a person of interest,” Tom said. “He’s got DA pressure to call it a botched mugging. I’m the pain in the ass digging deeper. Act normal, treat Ann right, and you’re good with me.”

“Thanks, Tom,” Jerry said, extending his hand. Tom shook it. “You hungry? Whatever you want’s on the house for a friend.”

“Nah, just ate,” Tom said. “But I’ll swing by before I leave, take you up on that.”

Tom mentally drew a line through Jerry’s name—not an X, just a single stroke.

Chapter Six

Tom stepped out of the shower at the Bay Ridge Hotel, towel in hand, when the phone jangled. He snatched it up. Ann’s voice came through, edged with scorn.

“Hi, Tom, it’s Ann.”

“Ann, what’s wrong?” Tom asked, wrapping the towel around his waist.

“I’ve been going through Jimmy’s things. Thought it’d be easier by now. Found three women’s phone numbers scrawled on Maimonides notepaper. And a photo of a pretty blonde with ‘I love you too’ scribbled on the back. He was a son of a bitch, Tom.”

“I’m sorry you had to find that, Ann,” Tom said, his voice low. “I know it cuts deep. Good you called. Let me come by and take a look.”

“I’ve got two more appointments. Stop by the apartment around eight. But Tom, after that, I’m done. Jimmy’s gone—he’s not my husband anymore. Never really was. I appreciate what you’ve done, but I’m moving on for good. Come say goodbye before you leave, but as for Jimmy’s mess, I don’t want to hear it.”

“I get it,” Tom said. “If this doesn’t break soon, I’ll wrap it and head back to L.A. I’ll leave you out of it.”

“Thanks, Tom. My client’s here. See you later.”

Tom got dressed and combed his hair, his stomach growling—he hadn’t eaten since breakfast, just coffee to keep him going.

What the hell was he doing here? Jimmy was an inconsiderate bastard who put Ann through hell, and he probably got what was coming. 

Homesickness hit hard, yearning for L.A.’s sun and familiar faces. He was about to pack it all in when the phone rang.

“Tom, it’s Mike Fox. We need to talk.”

“Hello, Mike. Talk about what? I don’t have much.”

“Well, I’m dropping in on Carmine tomorrow. I’ve had a plainclothes man shadowing Ann since this went down. Carmine was in for a manicure today, and other than the pizzeria, she hasn’t been with the kid. I want you to hear what he says.”

“Just tell me when, and I’ll be at your office,” Tom replied.

“Carmine rolls into the club around noon. Meet me at eleven. We’ll try to make sense of this mess.”

“I’ll be there,” Tom said, hanging up.

Tom leaned back on the bed, staring at the ceiling fan’s lazy spin, mirroring the muddled thoughts churning in his head.
Everything was back on the table. 

Unfortunately, the questions outnumbered the answers two to one.
Why hadn’t Ann mentioned Carmine’s manicure? And why hadn’t Jerry been staying over, especially now with Jimmy gone? 

What Tom knew for sure was that everyone came off devious. He was swimming in half-truths and hidden agendas.

He decided to stick it out the two weeks. No longer for Jimmy or Ann. Because he felt played for a fool, somehow being used.

He’d drop by Ann’s to grab the numbers of Jimmy’s nurse girlfriends, then hit the hospital. But he couldn’t mention Carmine to her—risking she’d tip him off.

Jerry had professed love for Ann, all charm and charisma. Maybe Tom’s gut reaction to the kid under the cemetery tree was spot on. Could Jerry be a decoy for Carmine, hiding a deeper tie to Ann? 

Those were the questions. What he needed were answers.

Tom needed a drink. The hotel lobby adjoined a tiny lounge—just a simple bar with three small tables pushed against the far wall.

The bartender was a woman about Tom’s age, her lined face suggesting she’d once mixed cocktails for classier crowds in fancier joints a lifetime ago. But here she was, pouring him a scotch and soda, offering a once-pretty visage for some harmless flirting.

“I get off at 2 a.m. I could drop by your room if you need company. Twenty bucks for the hour,” she murmured, leaning in close to his ear.

“It’s a tempting offer,” Tom replied, “but I’m here on business, and I work late. I’m enjoying your company, though.”

“Suit yourself, fella. Ten years ago, you couldn’t have afforded me,” she shot back, her voice laced with equal parts disappointment and melancholy.

He drained his drink and slid her a fin as a tip. “The offer still stands if you change your mind.”

“Hey, I just might take you up on that sometime.”

Tom left the bar and fired up his engine. He drove to Ann’s place to pick up the names and the picture, wary of whatever she might tell him.

He parked in front of Ann’s house and rang the bell. She cracked the door open barely halfway, leaning against it in a skimpy silk robe that left little to the imagination.

“I’d let you in, Tom, but it was a long day. Here are your names and the photo. Take a look at it.”

Tom pulled the photo from the envelope, one eye on the image and the other on Ann’s long bare legs.

“She’s pretty,” Ann said, her words slurring slightly—she’d obviously been drinking. “But she’s got nothing on me. Good luck with your investigation. Come see me before you leave.”

She shut the door, leaving Tom bewildered. She was becoming a complete enigma, and if her intention was to seem suspicious, it was working all too well.

Before heading to the hospital, he cruised past Marino’s Pizzeria. There was Jerry behind the counter with Tony, serving customers and twirling dough rounds.

Maybe Jerry was running cover for Carmine—or maybe he was being strung along, just like Tom felt he was.

He realized he’d never really gotten to know Ann; the only time he’d met her before now was at the wedding. Jimmy had portrayed her as an innocent neighborhood girl, but she was obviously a match for him—maybe even more so. Tom was learning that the hard way, and fast.

Chapter Seven

Around 11 p.m., a knock echoed at Ann’s apartment door. Unlike with Tom, she swung it wide, welcoming her lover with a deep kiss on the mouth.

She still wore the silk robe that had driven Tom to distraction. She threw her arms around his neck, pulling him close, nipping at his ear.
When the robe slipped to the floor, she stood naked beneath it. At forty, she kept her girlish figure—belly flat enough to bounce a quarter off, breasts he could nearly fit in his mouth.

The feel of his muscular shoulders thrilled Ann. They recalled Jimmy’s, but stronger, unlike the thin, wiry kid Jerry.

Carmine Perro was no kid; he was all man. He lifted her naked body, her thighs wrapping around his waist as she thrust her tongue deep into his mouth.

He carried her to the bedroom and tossed her onto the unmade bed. What started as a deal to square Jimmy’s gambling debts had twisted into a passion neither could define.

Tom’s thoughts lingered on Ann as he drove up Fort Hamilton Parkway toward Maimonides Hospital. She’d looked stunning in that silk robe at the door—teasing him on purpose, he figured, but why?

He cranked the radio. Mel Allen was wrapping up another Yankee win. Tom had grown up a fan. Baseball pulled his focus back to the job at hand.

At the front desk, the clerk pointed him to the security office, a door adjacent to the elevator bay. It stood ajar. A guy about Tom’s age, a little older sat at a desk, wrapping up a call.

“I’ll be right with you,” the man said, hand over the mouthpiece.

Tom dropped into a chair beside the desk. The office looked like a typical NYC precinct—green and blue paint peeling on steel desks and chairs, all no-nonsense edge.

The man hung up and eyed Tom. “Mr. Dukes. How can I help?”

Tom flashed his private investigator badge. “Tom Hart. Good friend of Jimmy Grillo’s. I’m looking into his murder for his wife.”

“Tom Hart,” Dukes said, nodding. “Detective Fox said you’d drop by. Worked twenty years at the 69th before retiring. Been here five.”

Tom shook his hand and pulled out the envelope Ann had given him at the door.
Dukes scanned the three names and the photo of the blonde.

“Yeah, all nurses here. The blonde is Celia Jorgensen, married to oncologist Dr. Vic Jorgensen. They were into some kinky stuff with Jimmy. A cleaning lady walked in on Celia giving him head in an empty operating room while the Doc watched, whacking himself off. She reported it to us. Word against word. I told them if anything was going on, take it off hospital grounds—or next time, it wouldn’t be just an accusation.”

“How about the other nurses?” Tom asked.

“Rumors only. Two are married, the other fresh out of college. Word is Jimmy used the O.R. more than the surgeons did. No complaints, though.”

“Can I talk to the Jorgensens?” Tom asked.

“Celia’s on duty. The Doc works days. He came in on his own time for that alleged fling in the O.R.”

“What floor is she on, and when’s her break?” Tom asked.

“Seventh floor, infectious diseases,” Dukes said. “Night shift’s usually slow. I’ll walk up and introduce you. Mike Fox already talked to her and the Doc. Haven’t heard from him since, so he probably didn’t think much of it.”

They rode the elevator to seven. Celia was leaning over a medicine cart, dividing pills for patients. Dukes approached with Tom and introduced them.

“Nurse Jorgensen, this is Tom Hart, a private investigator working the Jimmy Grillo murder. He’d like a word.”

Her eyes welled up immediately. She set down a bottle of pills and nodded. 

“Sure,” she said, directing them to the nurses’ lounge.

“First off, Nurse Jorgensen, I was a boyhood pal of Jimmy’s,” Tom said. “His wife’s upset over the murder and asked me to get to the bottom of it.”

She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue, crying softly. “Call me Celia. Jimmy was a very good friend of ours. We loved him and miss him terribly.”

“You say ‘ours.’ You and your husband?”

“Yes, me and Vic. We’ve had him at our home. It was an intimate friendship. We miss him so much.”

“Celia, I have to ask this as respectfully as possible,” Tom said. “Were you and your husband Jimmy’s lovers?”

“I was Jimmy’s lover,” she said. “Vic just liked to watch and pleasure himself. He’d join in sometimes, but they’d both make love to me, not each other.”

“Did your husband ever get jealous or angry about seeing you, his wife, with another man?”

“Of course not,” she said. “Vic encourages me to have other lovers, as long as he’s present. We’ve been into this since before we married.”

“And you, Celia? Ever jealous of Jimmy’s wife, take it out on him?”

“Oh, never,” she said, wiping tears from her cheeks. “I loved Jimmy more than the others. He was special to Vic and me. We thought the world of him.”

Tom and Dukes exchanged a glance, shaking their heads.

“Celia, thanks for your time. You answered everything. I’ll let you know if I need more. I’d like to speak to Dr. Jorgensen tomorrow. Here’s my number—have him call in the morning?”

“I will,” she said with a sad smile. “Hope I helped.”

Dukes and Tom spoke to the other three nurses. The two married ones insisted they were just friends. The younger one admitted she and Jimmy met in a hotel a couple times, but it ended there. Tom jotted it all in his notepad and returned to Dukes’s office with him.

“So, what do you think?” Dukes asked.

“We didn’t hear anything that points to murder,” Tom said. “Celia was the most salacious, but she was transparent. I don’t think she was lying.”

“Well talk to Dr. Jorgensen, and you’ll have done your due diligence,” Dukes said. “He’s a respected specialist—a genius. Saves lives, important ones. Hard to pin it on him without concrete evidence, no matter their lifestyle.”

“I know. Dukes,” Tom said, extending his hand. “I’ve got less than two weeks to figure this out before heading back to L.A. And it’s getting messier, not cleaner.”

“Well, keep plugging till then,” Dukes said. “Takes one small break to topple the whole house of cards. We’ve seen it a million times.”

Tom took his leave and headed back to the hotel. It was ten minutes to two. He stuck his head in the lounge and saw his bartender friend wiping down the bar with a damp towel.

He pulled up a stool and sat his tired, lonely ass down. He opened his mouth to say something, but she placed her index finger on his lips.

“No need to say anything. I had a feeling you’d be back. Let’s go to your room. Ten years ago, you couldn’t afford me. But tonight, I’m yours for a twenty.”

Chapter Eight

The bartender didn’t linger for cuddling. Wham, bam, thank you, ma’am—that’s all Tom’s twenty bucks bought, and that suited him fine.

After she left, he showered, scrubbing off the emotional grime that had clung to him since landing at LaGuardia.

The next morning, his phone’s ring jolted him awake. He rolled over to grab it, the nightstand clock reading 8:57 a.m.

“Hello,” Tom grunted, voice thick with sleep.

“Good morning. Dr. Jorgensen here. My wife said you wanted to talk.”

“Yes, Doctor. I’m Tom Hart, private investigator, working Jimmy Grillo’s murder. Can we meet this afternoon?”

“My schedule’s packed. Meet me in the hospital lobby at eight tonight. We’ll talk then.”

“You got it, Doctor. See you there.”

Tom had to meet Detective Mike Fox at his office at eleven a.m. Mike seemed hot on Carmine Perro—maybe the stakeout on Ann’s place had turned up something.

He’d be cautious about what to share and what to hold back. Fox would press for what Tom learned from Celia, which wasn’t much—just that she had deep feelings for Jimmy and was taking his death hard.

Fresh from the shower, Tom realized he hadn’t shaved yesterday. He grabbed his razor and went over his face twice, scraping clean. He dressed, combed his hair neatly, needing to look sharp, if only for himself. Loneliness hit hard. Even Ann felt different now, untrustworthy.

The pull of L.A. gnawed at him. He had to look out for himself, stay focused on the job, one step at a time.

Tom parked off 64th Street by 16th Avenue, a three-block walk to the precinct. The cool morning air got his blood pumping and loosened his mood.

He pulled open the precinct door and headed straight to Fox’s office.

“Tom, take a seat. Coffee?” Mike said.

“Yeah, thanks.” Tom poured a cup from the pot—dark and scalding.

“My guy watching Ann’s place says Carmine’s dropping by regularly now,” Mike said. 

“Spent the night twice in a row. Looks like a love affair.”

“Jesus, Mike, I don’t know what to think anymore,” Tom said. “I thought I knew Jimmy, and Ann by extension, but the Jimmy I knew died years ago. This Jimmy was a sexual deviant, and maybe Ann’s cut from the same cloth.”

“Easy, Tom,” Mike said. “You’re doing this for the Jimmy you knew, your boyhood pal, not what he became.”

“You’re right,” Tom said. “Still, I can’t wait to get back to L.A. Anyway, I spoke with Celia Jorgensen yesterday with your friend Dukes. She’s half nymphomaniac, half basket case. Started bawling when we mentioned Jimmy. It was a twisted setup with her, Jimmy, and her husband. The Jimmy I went to war with wouldn’t have recognized this one.”

“Think the husband got jealous and decided to end it for good?” Mike asked.

“Possible,” Tom said. “But Celia made it sound like they were all playing parts in some kinky sex game. I think they’re both sorry it’s over. I’m meeting the doctor tonight. We’ll see what he says.”

“This thing with Carmine’s complicated,” Mike said. “Probably been going on a while. Maybe Ann offered herself to keep Carmine from hurting Jimmy, and sparks flew.”

“If they fell in love, that’s a big motive for Carmine to knock Jimmy off,” Tom said. “What about Jerry, the kid?”

“A couple of Carmine’s goons, Al and Cowboy, took him to the back alley the night before you talked to him,” Mike said. “My guy followed. They didn’t work him over, just slapped him around. He hasn’t seen Ann since.”

“So Carmine’s our prime suspect for now,” Tom said, rubbing his chin nervously.

“Carmine and Ann,” Mike replied. “It’s noon. Time to hit the club and shake Carmine’s confidence.”

Mike drove from the precinct to the club on 66th Street, parking out front. He banged on the steel door, hard and long.

“Who the hell’s banging on my door?” shouted Al, Carmine’s hulking bodyguard.

Mike shoved his badge in Al’s face as the door opened, pushing past him. Cowboy, the other goon, stood behind the bar, same as last time Tom was there.

“You two, outside,” Mike ordered. “We’re talking to your boss alone.”

Al and Cowboy glanced at Carmine, waiting for his word.

“It’s okay, boys,” Carmine said coolly. “We got nothing to hide. Take a break.”

As Al and Cowboy shuffled out, Tom caught Cowboy’s stride—slightly bowlegged, like Jenny Miscussa described the killer.

“Have a seat at my table,” Carmine said, gesturing.

“What’s going on with you and Jimmy’s widow, Perro?” Mike asked.

“You mean my girlfriend, Ann,” Carmine said. “We made it official last night. Two consenting adults. Nothing to hide.”

“How about hiding that you had one of those goons crack Jimmy with a crowbar to clear the field?” Mike said.

“That marriage was dead anyway,” Carmine said. “Jimmy was a filthy pervert. Ann would’ve left him regardless.”

“So, was it a thousand or a hundred? Who’s lying, you or her?” Tom asked.

“Neither,” Carmine said. “Jimmy told her it was a grand to hide his debt. She was helping pay it off, and he was pocketing what she gave him.”

“You’ve got all the answers, don’t you, Perro?” Mike said.

“That’s how it works, right? You ask, I answer,” Carmine said. “And call me Carmine—no need to be so formal.”

“Maybe it was a thousand, and you arranged for Ann to pay you off in kind,” Tom said, locking eyes with him.

“Vivid imagination,” Carmine said. “Got proof?”

“I could drag you and those two in right now,” Mike said. “But we’re watching you. We’ve got a witness. Timing’s not right yet.”

“You’ve got nothing because I did nothing,” Carmine said. “The DA’s pushing you to close this as a mugging gone bad, which it probably is. Keep watching me.”

“Let’s go, Tom,” Mike said.

They climbed into Mike’s car and peeled out.

“He’s right, Mike. We’ve got theories and accusations, nothing solid. But Jenny told me the killer was bowlegged.”

“Bowlegged like Cowboy?” Mike said. “We could run him in now. Got a witness who can point him out if we make him walk for her.”

“Hold off,” Tom said. “Jenny’s scared stiff. She told me in confidence—she’d deny it if we pushed her to testify.”

“Well, we know it now,” Mike said. “Carmine had Cowboy kill Jimmy to clear the way for Ann. Clean and simple.”

“No proof yet,” Tom said. “We could drag Ann out of the beauty parlor, haul her to the precinct in cuffs, give her an old-fashioned interrogation. Show her what life with Carmine’ll be like.” His voice dripped with frustration.

“Let’s sleep on that,” Mike said. “You’re meeting the doctor tonight. Follow through. That’s good police work. Call me tomorrow, and we’ll bring her in like you said.”

At eight o’clock, Tom waited in the Maimonides Hospital lobby for Dr. Victor Jorgensen, whose wife, Celia, he’d questioned yesterday.

He had a clear view of the elevator. By 8:15, Tom was restless. He didn’t want to be here, didn’t care much about the case anymore. Ann, once his reason for digging, was now a prime suspect.

The elevator doors parted, and a man in a full-length white lab coat strode toward Tom.

“Dr. Jorgensen?” Tom asked.

“Yes. You must be Tom Hart, the P.I. from Los Angeles I spoke with this morning.”

“That’s me,” Tom said.

“Follow me. There’s a conference room we can use—more private.”

Jorgensen led Tom past a second bank of elevators and the gift shop.

“In here,” Jorgensen said, opening a door. “Never used this time of day. At least not for official business.” He chuckled softly.

“What’s it used for then?” Tom asked, playing along.

“Some folks use it for pleasure, not work, during off hours.”

“Is that what you and your wife did with Jimmy?” Tom asked. “Grab a conference room, do your thing, you watch?”

“Pretty much,” Jorgensen said. “Lots of fun. You should try it sometime.”

“I’ll pass, Doc,” Tom said. “Might’ve tempted me twenty years ago, but not now.”

“That’s why we do it,” Jorgensen said. “Keeps us young, you know.”

“Your wife kept saying she loved Jimmy,” Tom said. “Called him a gorgeous man, great lover, well-endowed. How’d that make you feel, Doc? Jealous? Angry?”

“It’s turning me on, detective,” Jorgensen said. “I’m calling Celia to invite a friend over tonight.”

Tom studied his eyes, searching for guilt or nerves. Nothing—just lust and depravity. A definite sicko, but a murderer? Hard to say.

“Thanks for your time, Doctor,” Tom said. “Pleasure meeting you and Mrs. Jorgensen.”

1nkeq8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nkeq8e/why_should_you_choose_the_ge_fqk2j_under_sink/,Why Should You Choose the GE FQK2J Under Sink Water Filter Review?,"The GE FQK2J Under Sink Water Filter Replacement has become a key part of my daily life. Over the past several months, I've relied on this filter for its dual-flow technology and efficiency in reducing impurities like chlorine, rust, and sediment in my drinking water. My household has particularly demanding filtration needs, so this was a critical purchase for enhancing water quality. The twist-and-lock design, compatible with models like GE GXK285JBL and others, simplifies installation and replacement—a massive plus for someone as maintenance-averse as I am.

**User-Friendly Features Make It Stand Out**  
One of the notable aspects of this water filter is its hassle-free installation. The twist-and-lock mechanism eliminates the need for tools, making the replacement process intuitive and mess-free. This user-friendly feature is something that sets it apart; I didn’t feel like I needed to call a plumber or watch a dozen tutorials to get it right. If you're worried about water pressure, rest easy—this filter supports pressures from 35 to 125 psi and temperatures between 33 and 100°F. It’s well-suited for almost any household plumbing setup.

**Advanced Filtration for Better Health**  
What really caught my attention with this water filter is its NSF/ANSI certification. It’s not just fluff; this certification ensures it meets specific quality and safety standards. The advanced carbon block filtration removes chlorine-resistant cysts, VOCs, select pharmaceuticals, and even lead. Over time, I’ve noticed a huge difference. I no longer sense that metallic taste in my water, and my tea and coffee taste cleaner and fresher. 

**Benefits**  
- Dual-flow parallel filtration delivers efficient performance.
- Removes a broad range of contaminants, including lead and select VOCs.
- Tool-free, mess-free installation design.
- Supports up to 300 gallons of water, making it long-lasting.  

**Minor Areas for Improvement**  
Every product has its challenges, and this filter isn’t without flaws. One thing that stands out is its six-month lifespan. Though it’s normal for filters to require replacement, I found that in a larger household like mine, it may need replacing sooner than six months because of the high water usage. Additionally, the packaging could use improvement, as I had a minor scare when the filter arrived slightly dented. Thankfully, it didn’t compromise its performance.

**Critiques**  
- Six-month replacement interval might seem short for high-usage households.  
- Packaging needs to be sturdier for heavy shipping conditions.  

**Performance Compared to Rivals**  
While there are countless under-sink filters on the market, the FQK2J holds its own among competitors. For instance, compared to Whirlpool’s under-sink filters, GE models excel in user-friendly designs that cater to less experienced DIY users like myself. However, Whirlpool filters often boast extended lifespan and may require fewer replacements annually, which could be more budget-friendly in the long run. Another popular competitor, the Brita Total360, offers effective filtration but lacks the advanced connection designs of GE filters, making installation slightly more cumbersome.

**True Value for Investment**  
When weighing cost against performance, this filter offers solid value for what it provides. Given its capability to handle 300 gallons of water before needing a replacement, it appeals both to larger families and individual households seeking clean drinking water. The advanced filtration features might make you think it’s priced sky-high, but its competitive range makes it a smart financial choice. Maintenance also doesn’t involve extra tools or costly professional services, saving long-term expenses.

Starbucks is facing its most profound crisis since 2008. The numbers are grim: global sales are falling, customer traffic is plummeting, and profit margins are collapsing.

In China, what was once their biggest growth engine has become a strategic disaster. They've been completely outmanoeuvred by a local, tech-savvy competitor (Luckin Coffee) and their market share has collapsed. They're now reportedly looking to sell a stake in the China business at a steep discount.

Back in the US, the company is locked in a bitter and expensive war with its own workforce, as hundreds of stores have unionised and the company faces charges of illegal union-busting.

The market is pinning all its hopes on the new CEO, Brian Niccol, the guy credited with turning around Chipotle. He has a comprehensive ""Back to Starbucks"" plan to fix the in-store experience, improve efficiency, and innovate the menu.

The problem? The stock is still trading at an insane valuation (P/E over 36), pricing in a perfect, flawless execution of this turnaround. This seems insane given the massive headwinds. Is the faith in one man justified, or is the market ignoring a business whose fundamentals are cracking?

I wrote a full, in-depth analysis breaking down the numbers, the China debacle, the union fight, and whether Niccol's plan has a realistic chance of success against such a risky backdrop.

Hi Reddit,

Long time reader, first time poster. 

I am really struggling to figure out a way forward in my marriage and it plagues my mind every day. I am really hoping for objective perspective because it's been difficult to come by these days. 

  
I (31F) married my husband (35M) last year after being together for nearly 5 years. Our relationship has generally been positive throughout that time but I find him to be generally passive and calm about most things, which I used to love (because I am very much not that way being the anxious ball of energy that I am), and it's really coming to a head. I feel like I am reaching the crossroads of feeling like I have to end my marriage because of the impact his family has on not only myself, but our marriage. 

  
For context: I moved several hours away from my hometown (I am an only child with chronically sick parents) to attend grad school. We had a meet-cute very randomly and we fell for each other almost immediately right in the middle of school. After I finished school, I decided to move in with him in the area where he grew up and where most of his family still lives. I never lived anywhere else prior to college/grad school (and I spent all of my collegiate schooling at the same university), so I wanted to try somewhere new because he made it sound great. But I realized pretty quickly that I missed home. Or at least the idea of home. I have a lot of trauma back in my home town so I wasn't trying to rush back home, but I still missed it. I was in grad school during the peak of COVID so before I graduated, I spent a lot of time with him at his parents house because he was the only person I was able to see in person. We had to commute about 45 minutes to see each other, and so it meant I stayed at their house for like a week at a time during a relatively new relationship (8 months together at this point). Things were cordial at the time with his parents and I generally enjoyed my time there, except I felt that they could be a little overbearing. 

Once I graduated (almost 3 years into relationship), we moved in together and there were the natural growing pains. His longest relationship was 5 months before he met me, so I think there were a lot of things that were new for him. I had come from a string of emotionally abusive relationships (and unfortunately about 5 months before I met him, I was SA'd by a coworker and was dealing with the PTSD of that and previous trauma) so we had a lot to learn about living together. I think it would be difficult for anyone, but I think it was complicated by the fact that his family played a huge role in his life, and suddenly, my life.

My husband has always been very close with his family (multiple trips as a family over the years for weeks at a time, frequent dinners together and extremely lavish birthdays and holiday parties) and he always brought me along, which at first I thought was nice because he wanted me around. He is the older brother with 2 younger siblings who are twins (33M and F). Everyone is generally loud and talking over each other when everyone is together, and I am a quiet person, so I never really felt comfortable interjecting my voice because I don't like yelling. Everyone always commented about how I was so quiet. 

At every family event, there is always (and I literally mean it when I say always) a fight. Either it's my BIL, or my MIL, and then my husband was always the peacekeeper and mediator. I told him that this bothered me because I didn't feel like he needed to step in, and he always mentioned that it was fine, it didn't bother him. Sometimes, my husband was the ""victim"" and my BIL would just lay into him. I know I am an only child and I may not know a sibling's dynamic personally, but I can just tell when it feels like a joke, and there are times where I don't think BIL is joking. Examples include: ""you're a fat, lazy piece of shit who doesn't know how to get a job""; ""you are useless""; other variations of the same thing. BIL has also told me that if women are SA'd, they probably had some hand in what happened to them. I visibly cried in front of him and he couldn't care less. (This was the first time I met him in person).

Having had partners and seen their dynamics, I had never seen anything like this before, so I started to speak up at future family gatherings. I would then be yelled at for interjecting myself in a place where I was ""not wanted"", and my husband would say it was fine and ""this is just how BIL is sometimes"". 

This is not even getting into my interactions with my MIL. She is a kind, generous person to the friends in her life, but I don't seem to fall into that category. She praises my BIL's husband verbally all the time (""wow, what a delicious cup of coffee, thank you!""; ""thanks so much for cleaning up the dinner table!""; ""it's so impressive the work you do,""). The only ""compliments"" I get are that my husband ""no longer dresses like a slob"". 

There is a long line of comments from her that make me feel small and undervalued. I contribute a lot to cleaning up the kitchen as well, or helping to make dinner (and I am \*not\* comfortable in the kitchen by any means). One time I was calling my mom to check in with her, and my MIL yelled at me to say ""come on, you don't get to get out of cleaning!"" - meanwhile, my SIL was sitting in her room playing video games. She gave me a half-assed apology and I, tbh, I didn't forgive her because she called me out in front of everyone for checking in to see how my ailing mother was doing because I hadn't had a free moment to answer her calls that whole week. 

During the first 3-4 years of our relationship, my husband said he never noticed that his mom treated me this way. He tried to explain it that ""this is just how she is"", and ""this is how I know you're in the family now"". I told him I didn't really appreciate being treated this way and to please try to notice the micro aggressions. However now when he does see it (but he only catches maybe 20% of the offenses), he tries to say something and he is quieted down by the family because they feel that I ""should speak up for myself"". Which I have now started doing, and I'm told that I'm wrong, despite speaking about my own feelings. I have been in therapy for more than half of my life, I have really mastered the ""I feel \*blank\* when I see \*blank\*, etc etc).

Long story short: I am in couples therapy with my husband, personal therapy for myself, and family therapy with everyone in my husbands family. For the last 7 sessions, it has been what feels like a personal attack about all the things I have done. It comes with statements that say ""you never do this"" and ""you always do that"", rather than speaking about their feelings. Despite my inclination to protect myself, my husband said it was important to him that we try this to try and bridge the gaps, so I continue to attend. However, I feel that my feelings are not validated and I have made every effort to be vulnerable. At this point, I am giving up on family therapy because it just feels like I am being ganged up on when there are clearly ways that everyone (including myself) can improve upon communication. 

The last straw came when I had finished speaking about how I just wanted to feel welcomed and wanted in this new family like my BIL's husband is, and I was told that ""this is not how this family does things, only children ask for verbal validation"". And my BIL followed up with ""you have the thinnest skin out of anyone I have ever met"". I walked out of the session after that. I save lives every day at my job and I am a doctor. I come from a respectable family and speak 2 languages and I have enriched my husband's (just like he has enriched mine), and I have had so much pain dealt to me throughout my life and I have continued to push forward. I am a first generation college student. I have worked too hard to continue to deal with my BIL's temper tantrums. 

My husband still believes there is hope, and even says that he hopes to attend the holidays with them. I firmly disagree and do not want to be present and I want more distance, and he does not. He is not ready to cut them out, which I know is normal and not an easy thing to expect of him, but I cry pretty much every day because of all of the abuse I continue to face. I have become a shell of a human because I see my in-laws at least once a week because we live in a house they own (my husbands decision and my MIL's impulse purchase that left me with no agency). 

I want to never see his family again. It's so painful. I miss my parents. I don't have a support system here. When I have talked to my long-time friends, who have seen me go through a whole level of shit (and have also seen me during my most toxic moments when I was running away from the pain), they are begging me to leave. My parents are supportive, but I get the feeling that they want me to leave, too. Even my friends who have known my husband and his family for longer than I have, say that this is too much for one person to deal with. 

I am afraid. I love my husband and I think if we were the family that only saw each other 1-2 times a year, I could hand the verbal abuse. But it's constant. I can't run away from it. I feel like my only option is to leave. My husband and I want to have kids, but he doesn't agree that his mom and brother shouldn't be in the child's life, even in spite of everything that is said. I know I can't expect him to just suddenly make a huge change like that, but I've told him that I am thinking of leaving to protect my own peace. He is devastated, he says, and hopes I won't. But I've just learned that my in-laws cancelled all future family therapy sessions until further notice. So I don't know that I have many other options. It would mean uprooting my career and all future hope of having kids, but it's that or my life at this point. I have never felt more depressed and hopeless. 

Thanks for sticking around for the novel and I hope it makes some sense (just came off a long, long shift at work and feeling burnt out). I just needed to get this out. I don't think I'm perfect by any means, but I don't know that accidental slip-ups or miscommunications warrant this level of pain. I feel so, so alone.

Our null member (Host-ish, who is basically the base that doesn't have any particular identity other than the body) has had difficulties reaching us for a year or two at this point. The last time we were fully active was sometime in 2023-24. However, they have recently begun a nonbinary transmasculine transition, and started testosterone one week ago. Actually, today is the day we are due for our next shot.

Perhaps it is the hormones, or it is other chaos in our life (various mental health appointments), but either way, we have noticed an increased connectivity. For example, I am able to be here writing this post in the first place. I used my name, Harmony, when ordering coffee. (I wonder what the barista thinks about us ordering under so many different names, haha.)

Now, most of us in the system, such as myself, are not transmasculine (or even very masculine at all), but we are disconnected enough with the body that we do not mind what happens to it as long as it is physically healthy. And if this is what the null member, who is most connected to it and is the one that is always active, wants, then that is completely fine. I just wonder if that is what is causing this increased system activity.

1nkem55,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nkem55/my_project_bridging_the_us_access_gap_for_truly/,My project: bridging the US access gap for truly elite European roasters. A lab out of Cincinnati.,"Hello everyone,

Like many of you, I've been perpetually frustrated by the challenge of getting fresh, exceptional coffee from the European vanguard here in the States. I decided to build a project to solve this for myself and a small circle of fellow enthusiasts: **Entropica Coffee Co.**

The mission is to operate as a curator, focusing exclusively on what's happening in Europe. The core of my setup is a small lab here in Cincinnati where I've focused on the variables: a full deionization/remineralization system for water control and a rigorous cupping protocol to vet every coffee that comes through the door.

The first coffee I brought in for the project is a definitive statement: a **Washed Geisha from Diego Horta, roasted by Un.Common in Amsterdam.**

I wanted to share my experience with this coffee as a contribution to the community.

* **Roaster:** Un.Common (Amsterdam, NL)
* **Producer:** Diego Samuel Bermúdez Horta
* **Varietal:** Geisha
* **Process:** Multi-stage Anaerobic Washed

https://preview.redd.it/firyo2r4eypf1.png?width=1379&format=png&auto=webp&s=029137e454532d66f2d83f1056b7376e72f3fa8d

**Assessment:** This is a stunning coffee. It's a perfect synthesis of elite genetics (Geisha) and meticulous scientific process. The multi-stage anaerobic wash has created an extraordinary level of aromatic complexity without sacrificing the elegance of the varietal. It’s a challenging, thought-provoking cup.

**Brewing Protocol & Notes:** I found it expressed best with a hybrid, gentle approach to preserve its delicate aromatics.

* **Brewer:** Hario V60 (Glass)
* **Grinder:** Fellow Ode Gen 2 (Gen 2 Burrs)
* **Grinding Method:** Manually slow-fed beans at \~5-7 beans/sec. While the burr gap is \~607μm (setting 5), this technique narrows the particle distribution, resulting in a nominal peak particle size closer to 723μm.
* **Filter:** Sibarist B3 Hybrid (with Booster 22)
* **Dose:** 15g
* **Water:** 232.5g (1:15.5 ratio) @ 195°F (90.5°C)
* **Pour Structure:**

* **Technique Notes:**
   * I maintain a level of interstitial water between pours, never allowing the bed to drain completely until the final drawdown.
   * **Note on the Pulsar screen:** When using the dispersion screen, I hold it separately over the brewer. Be aware that it retains a few grams of water, so you may need to discard this excess to the side to hit your target brew weight with precision.
* **Results:**
   * **TDS:** 1.32%
   * **Extraction Yield:** 19.5% - 20%
* **Tasting Notes:** The profile is exceptionally elegant. I got bright, structured notes of lime, leading to a complex floral finish of verbena. There's a distinct creamy texture. If you've ever had DAK's Botanica & DAK's White Lotus, this coffee is a perfect marriage of those two but with a very subtle mint/cooling aftertaste.

If you are, then hi! I am looking for an IRL friend! My main interests involve music, movies, arts and crafts. I love laughing and having fun! I am looking for a REAL, platonic friendship. I am in a very happy relationship. Happily child-free.

I have tried Bumble BFF with disastrous luck, Meetup has been extremely disappointing. Needless to say, I'm desperate for a friend like me. Someone who's life doesn't revolve around coffee and pilates, who doesn't live based off trends they found on social media, someone with hobbies and passions. 

I'm autistic, queer, and left-leaning. I have my views but I'm not interested in talking politics. 

I love horror and comedy, I just recently saw Weapons and loved it!
I do *not* like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, any general gun-shooting action movies and most anime.

I listen to a very wide variety of genres of music. I am not even joking when I say I even enjoy Mongolian throat singing, it's magnificent. But right now, I'm really into electronic and rock (i'm going to see Sleep Token in concert!!!!!!)

I enjoy cooking, though I'm kinda picky. I dislike a certain variety of foods which pretty much rules out all Mexican and Indian food. Give me ALL the pizza, hot wings, and ice cream!

I love cozy, sandbox, and survival games. Huge Sims fan since childhood, current obsession is Grounded. (If I can beat the damn thing, then off to Grounded 2!!)

I'm not religious, and while I respect your beliefs, I would prefer to befriend someone who aligns more with my fundamental beliefs about the universe.

I am sober, I don't mind if you drink but I will not be your bar or clubbing buddy. I am 420 friendly though!

I'd really like to get back into roller skating. :)

DM me some details about you, not just ""hey"" please? Tell me about your pets or favorite movie, what music artist you are into right now and for the love of god don't say she who must not be named.

I used to struggle a lot with this. I’d only get serious when the deadline was close enough to make my heart race. But over time, I picked up some strategies that help me create urgency even when the deadline is weeks away:

1. Set “mini-deadlines.” Instead of focusing on the final due date, I give myself checkpoints (for example, outline by Wednesday, first draft by Sunday). It doesn`t always work, but it works most of times.

2. Actually research the task. In most cases I procrastinate because I have no idea how to do the task. So I research, I watch videos, I review [examples](https://hub.edubirdie.com/examples/) of similar works, and it becomes way less messy in my mind.

3. Gamify progress. I track streaks or give myself tiny rewards (coffee, a walk, 20 minutes of a show) whenever I hit a milestone.

4. Visualize the pain of last-minute stress. Sounds funny, but I remind myself how awful it feels to pull an all-nighter - and how good it feels to be done early. That contrast usually pushes me to start. 

5. Study/work with others. Even if their deadlines are different, having accountability makes me act like their deadline is mine too. And you tend to do more when others around you are working.

These tricks helped me stop waiting until the panic stage  - and reduced my anxiety a lot.",1,1758216174.0,StudyStruggle,0,1.0,False

I(39F) temporarily have to use a wheelchair for longer distances due to a currently undiagnosed issue with my leg. 
My PT advised me to use one, and my husband rented a nice, small wheelchair for me. 
I'm able to roll myself (good workout) and did some training and manoeuvres in our local shopping centre. 

I visited an small zoo last weekend, with my husband.
My husband was getting coffee and I was waiting outside the restaurant. 
A kid (age 7? Idk, not good with ages) and his dad, got curious about my wheelchair. 
I understand that kids get curious and want to ask questions, but I barely understand why I'm in a wheelchair currently. I was really not in the mood to explain my issues or be educational about it. 
So I just mentioned that sometimes someones leg doesn't work. 
Cue to more questions and I said that I didn't want to answer more questions because I was tired. 
The kids dad wasn't pleased with that respons and mentioned that it was a good lesson for the kid. 
Now, I basically wanted to tell him that I'm not a zoo attraction. 
But there was a kid, and I didn't want to make a drama. Luckily my husband showed up with coffee and rolled me away. 

Tldr 
Kid asks questions about my wheelchair. I didn't want to educate the kid about my wheelchair. His dad didn't like that. 

AITA 
For not wanting to educate a kid about my wheelchair.

Pinatawad ko, sayang yung 3yrs and para malinis konsensya ko bahala na sa Gsauce sa kanya kung gagawin pa nya ulit, then thats it. It still bothers the sht out of me, pano ba dapat gawin dito. Tama ba na pinatawad ko agad?   
  
Met her on a dating app, working ako that time (went back to school to finish my bachelors), sya naman matagal na sa corporate job. I was working on sales that time, fresh from a toxic relationship yung binabantayan soc med, pinupuntahan sa work, emotional, physical abuse type of sht na relasyon. So I decided na mag download ng dating app, pang dagdag leads etc, to ease my mind off that time. Nagka match kami ni gf after new year, fresh pa yung kalmot from the toxic relationship that I had. (As in malalim na kalmot , my work friends know all about this sht hahah) Nung nagka match na kami ni gf, madami din ako nakamatch and naka usap that time thinking na oks lang naman siguro to since wala naman ako gf since kakagaling nga lang sa breakup and gusto ko maka experience nung madami kausap outside of work. Nag click naman kami asap since parehas kami ng views sa buhay, career, values, personal growth etc. Then after a few days ata or a week inaya nya ako na pumunta sa kanila kasi wala sya kasama. Midnight na neto, wala din ako idea san yung place nya wala pako commission nun meaning wala ako enough budget. But I still went since sya naman nag invite, sagot nya na daw grab. In short may nangyari samin that night, pero nakipag meet pa din ako sa iba kong naka match and I started labeling them in which city they live in. WALANG NANGYARI SA MEETUP dun sa iba kong naka match, nahuli din naman ako ni current gf kasi naki login ako sa laptop nya para makagawa ng report sa work kaya nahuli ako. Dun na nya ako tinanong kung EXCLUSIVE ba kami. Di ko din naman dineny, inamin ko din bat ko ginawa and SWORE TO NEVER DO IT EVER. Now why am I starting this sht with a long ass intro, this will be used against me hahah

She graduated on one of the top 4, bahala na kayo manghula basta maayos upbringing ni gf, ako under grad I'm on my 4th yr finishing my thesis. Nagpa kilala ako ng maayos sa relatives nya, specially sa parents nya since she's living with her lola na tinatanong pa kung san ako naka graduate, san nag wwork typical boomer na gusto lang yung best para sa apo nya I get it. Yung mama ko halos ka age na ng lola nya, separated na parents ko since 2017 nag cheat papa ko sa mama ko kaya never ko binalak mag cheat sa jowa. Naging okay naman kami pero nung bumalik ako ng school di na namin matago na kaya ako nag wwork sa sales kasi di pako nakaka graduate, so nung nakabalik ako school di na din namin natago sa relatives specially sa lola ng gf ko. They eventually accepted me naman, I gained their trust specially ni gf she supported me all the way talaga. Pandemic pa neto, yung mama ko nasa province pa nag babantay ng farm at pinpatayo na bahay so palawan pera padala yung baon ko that time, wala ako ipon sa sales job ko kasi ako nag pprovide sa toxic relationship ko before. Kaya hands down talaga ako kay gf, akala pa namin that time na masyado namin minamadali yung progress ng relationship namin kaya talagang dinelay pa nya nung sinagot nya ko kasi gusto nya na never ko na ma-bring up si toxic ex pag naging kami na.

After 3 months naging kami, mahilig sya mag bigay ng gifts. Yung tipong makita lang nya na ilike ko or sinearch ko bibilhin na nya, sobrang spoiled nya ko nun. Until naging too much na to the point na depleted na yung savings nya kasi panay pa ang labas namin. Nung naka uwi na mama ko, sinabihan nako na alam mo namang di tama yan bat tinatanggap ko daw yung mga regalo. Shempre ayoko naman tanggihan baka magmuka akong ungrateful or what pero napag usapan naman namin na di kailangan may regalo or umalis alis, mas ok na yung magkasama kami kahit sa bahay lang nila. Tsaka nag open up naman sya sakin na na-mmroblema na sya kasi ang laki na ng bills nya so I did my best na wag nang maka dagdag as much as possible sa gastusin kasi wala naman akong work. May mga sideline naman ako habang nag aaral pero di ganun ka-consistent and most of the time si gf yung nag sshoulder ng expenses.

All this time akala ko ok kami since na establish naman namin yung priorities na-lessen din yung mga alis alis tsaka bili bili ng mag di naman talaga kailangan. It even came to a point na nagpahanap na sya sakin ng sideline pinatulan nya yung pogo kasi nga di na biro yung bills kaya talagang ininsist ko na wag na nya ako isama sa mga lakad nya. Di ko din naman sya masisisi pag naiirita sya since di naman biro yung expenses, Umabot pa na sinigawan nyako habang nasa labas kami kasama namin yung college bestie nya. Kinausap ko sya na wag naman sana ganun kasi lumaki ako sa dysfunctional na bahay, I grew up experiencing that type of sht yung ipapahiya ka ng sarili mong parents sa harap ng ibang tao. Kaya big deal talaga sakin yung nasisigawan in public, nag sorry naman sya so goods na. Until na ulit sya ng naulit hanggang sa naging immune na lang ako kasi baka nga stressed sa work and bills kaya inintindi ko sya. As much as possible pag nasa kanila ako, I help out specially sa gawaing bahay, linis, hugas, drive etc basta di maging palamunin pag nasa kanila. I tried my best to help in ways na kaya ko for now, nagsabi din ako sa kanya na once maka graduate at makapag work ako ibabalik ko yung nawala sa savings nya.

Di naman talaga kami madalas mag away as in sobrang bihira lang namin mag away not until last month, birth month ko parang every other day bigla bigla na lang akong sinisigawan sa harap ng relatives nya, specially sa harap ng nanay at pinsan nya. Dun nako talagang nagtaka bat sobra sobra na lang sya pumitik sakin. So lumalabas ako sa room nya pag nag wwork sya para di ako maka istorbo, basta sinisigurado ko na pag gising nya ok na lahat ng mga kailangan nya. Mismong birthday ko nag away pa kami kasi inantay ko sya maka uwi galing sa office nag rto sya that time, ako naman kakauwi lang galing school. Late na kami parehas naka uwi, di pako nag ddinner sya naman naka kain na daw kasama mga officemates nya. So ako napikon ako na bat di man lang sya nag inform, ""babe nag dinner nako kain kana din"". Inantay ko pa sya di man lang nagawang mag message, sya pa nagalit sakin bat di daw ako nag dinner. So pinabayaan ko na lang ulit baka pagod sya sa work, after a day or two may pinag diskusyunan nanaman kami about sa damit na nilagay ko sa bed na gusto nya ipalagay sa cabinet nya so ako naman tong finold muna bago ilagay sa cabinet nya. Nagalit pa din bakit ko daw iffold bat di nalang ilagay sa cabinet like what she said, underwear daw yun bat ko daw iffold di ko man lang daw sya binigyan ng kahihiyan tapos biglang napunta yung topic on how to properly take care of our dog at eventually yung thesis ko. 

Di ko talaga maintindihan bat bigla nadamay thesis ko, knowing na ako lang mag isa sa thesis ko kasi umatras mga kasama ko. na-mmroblema nako kung pano ko tatapusin tapos bigla bigla syang sasabog sakin. Bakit daw ako mag papagawa or magpapatulong sa iba, kaya ko naman daw. I've been constatly asking for help kung kanikanino para lang gumalaw yung thesis ko tapos kaya nya na bring up kasi pag nagpa tulong daw ako may bayad yun, tapos sya daw mag sshoulder. Mama ko nagpapa aral sakin, hindi gf ko. Oo may instances na nang hihiram ako sa kanya na di ko nababalik agad pero never ako nag obliga sa kanya na gastusan ako. 

Bigla akong nangliit nung dinamay nya yung thesis ko, gusto kong umuwi nun kahit madaling araw na. Pinigilan nyako, ayoko din gumawa ng eksena sa kanila. So pinalipas ko na lang yung nangyari, the following day may gender reveal yung kababata ko umattend kami as if walang nangyari for the past few days. Pag uwi namin nag sorry ako na ganun yung mga nangyari and all tapos nung kinaumagahan maaga din sya nagising eh di naman sya morning person yun pala mag papakulay ng buhok kasama yung college bestie nya so wala nakong ibang sinabi. Pero nung umaga na yun parang iba yung feeling ko parang may gusto ako malaman so chineck ko phone nya para makita kung kanino nya sinend yung picture nung tito ko (ex PBA, current head coach sa UAAP) kahit na alam kong sa kawork nya isesend pero chineck ko pa din phone nya just to make sure na dun nya talaga isesend. Not until I checked her IG, tangina nanginig ako nung nakita ko yung convo online 27 mins ago. 

May constant update, looking forward kumbaga kahit na di na kareply reply yung convo. Di ko sure kung ano pa yung pinag usapan nila, kung may mga I love you or what. Nung nakita kong nag ssend ng mirror pic na naka flex yung lalaki talagang nawalan ako ng confidence bigla sa sarili ko eh. Kinonfront ko sya sa labas jollibee malapit sa salon, sya lang lumabas tapos nung tinanong ko sya kung may aaminin sya. Todo dedma sya, tinanong ko sya kung sure ba syang wala syang aaminin. Wala daw so umuwi nako samin, nung nag chat sya pinakita ko sa kanya yung convo nila nung taga Houston bigla na lang syang nag sorry. Di ko nabasa yung pinaka umpisa ng convo nila pero nung nakita kong nag send ng ganung picture yung lalaki tapos naka heart react pa sya hinayaan ko na lang sya na maka labas ng bahay nila nun. Ang nakaka gago pa sa ginawa nya is ginamit nya yung aso namin para mag tuloy tuloy yung usapan nila nung lalaki. May mga sinesend pa sya na pictures na nasa labas kami. Magkasama kami tapos ako pa kumuha nung pictures, tangina the audacity. Sobrang gigil ko sa kanya nun, tapos sinabi ko na sa college bestie nya yung nangyari. Naging close din kami ng college bestie nya kasi parehas kami galing middle east so kapatid na din turing ko, nag sorry ako na di ko sya na greet ng maayos sa jollibee. Nung pinakita ko yung screenshots akala pa nya may nag ssend sakin ng mirrror pics tapos nung sinabi ko na convo yung ng bespren nya. 

Nagulat din sya, di nya kilala yung guy kaya mas lalo akong nang gigil. Habang magkausap kami ng college bestie nya, panay ang sorry nya sakin aayusin nya daw and sht. Sabi ko pa sa bestie nya na galingan nya mag maangmaangan kasi inaantay lang daw nya nag magkwento sa kanya. Naluluha daw kasi akala nya dahil matapang yung gamot pang kulay ng buhok pero yung totoo naiiyak kasi nahuli. After a few hours pinuntahan ako samin, na never nya naman ginawa mag eexplain daw sya pag labas namin sa condo pinaglakad ko sya nag hanap kami ng coffee shop na pwede mag usap pero gusto ko lang talaga sya pag lakarin kasi ayaw na ayaw nyang pinag-papawisan. So bumalik kami sa bahay nila inaantay ko syang mag salita pero wala akong ibang narinig kundi puro sorry tapos iyak ng iyak so lalo lang akong napikon kasi sorry lang sya dahil na huli sya. 

Sabi nya di daw nya alam pano nya aaminin sakin, inabot daw sila ng 1 month na ""NAG KAMUSTAHAN LANG"" tapos nung hinihingan ko ng proof deleted na yung convo. Ang hirap paniwalaan na kamustahan lang talaga, malay ko ba kung nag meet ba sila bago umalis yung lalaki or may plano ba sila mag kita in the future. Di ko din alam kung nag vc or what. Basta nung nakita ko yung palitan ng pictures tsaka yung pag type ng ""Pahinga kanaaa"" wtf 3 letters pa! ganyan din sya sakin nung una hahaha tapos ang react pa sakin blue heart, pero dun sa lalaki red heart. Yung lalaki nakakamusta nya, ako di nya makamusta. Yung convo namin sobrang dry halos sarili ko lang pala kausap ko hahahah Update ko sagot ko tanginang yan. 

Kaya daw nya nagawa kasi pagod daw sya nag hanap ng outlet. Inamin nya na nag hanap sya ng comfort sa iba, kaya daw nya nagawa kasi nga dahil sa bills and work load na kuntento naman na daw sya sa work nya before pa sya pumasok sa pogo. Napilitan sya lumipat ng work para tumaas sahod matagal daw kasi sa kanila maapprove yung increase. Ang di ko maintindihan is nag adjust ako na di makadagdag sa gastos nya. I've been open, honest and pure ang intentions ko sa kanya, never talaga ako nag expect na gagawin nya sakin to kaya sobrang disappointed ako sa kanya. All this time sa relationship namin ako yung ineexpect ng family and friends nya na baka lolokohin or pagsamatalahan sya, I had to take all the heat kasi nga gusto ko ma-earn yung approval nila na kahit undergrad ako deserve ko si gf. Pero yun pala ako pa yung pinag mukang tanga. Nung tinanong ko sya may balak ba sya aminin sakin meron naman daw, nung tinanong ko kung kelan di daw nya alam. So never ending loop na lang. 

After 3-4 days pinag bigyan ko sya kasi ayoko masayang yung pinagsamahan namin. Kumbaga nakasanayan na namin yung isat isa. Dun ulit ako sa kanila natutulog as if walang nangyari, umattend pa kami ng birthday ng auntie nya, 5 days ako natutulog sa kanila. Umuuwi na lang ako pag may f2f and everytime na umuuwi ako samin di ko maalis sa isip ko yung ginawa nya, napag usapan naman na namin na aayusin namin pero di talaga ako maka get over na nagawa nya sakin yun. Nag ssorry sya pero parang wala nang meaning sakin yung pag ssorry nya. Nag check pako ng convo sa messenger nya just to check where and what went wrong. Am I the one to blame? Nung inamin nya kung bakit nya nagawa yun dahil di nya na pala ako nakikitaan ng eagerness at direction ko sa buhay. Mag 30 na daw sya wala pa daw sya napundar, di na sya naka bili ng sasakyan, condo, di matuloy yung plano mag masters kaya nya daw nagawa mag hanap ng comfort sa iba. Nanliit ako nung sinabi nya sakin yun, parang mali na naging kami? para bang lahat ng effort ko went right out the window. Ang nakakatawa pa nyan is pinapa nuod nya sakin yung movie ni Toni Gonzaga at Piolo Pascual na ganyan din linyahan. Direction sa buhay HAHAHA

Sa kanya na umikot mundo ko, it even came to the point na di ko na naalagaan sarili ko just to tend to her needs. To make it up to her and her sacrifices, totoo talaga na love isn't enough. Nung tinanong ko sya kung may work at ipon bako gagawin nya ba yun, sabi nya hindi. And there it is friends! The fvcking truth! ahahahha Nakakatawa lang na ginagapang ko yung traffic mahatid sundo lang sya, Nung tinanong ko sya if mapapatawad nya ko kung ako yung nakagawa nun sa kanya OO DAW kaya minention ko yung ibang naka match sa dating app kasi brining up nya to HAHAHHA

Pinupuntahan ko sya rain or shine anytime of the day basta mag chat sya na gusto nyako kasama. Kaya din ako nakakapag stay sa kanila kasi gusto nya magkasama kami, halos mag live-in na kami. Umuuwi na lang ako samin para kumuha ng damit tapos balik nanaman sakanila.  Nag muka akong boy, all around sa bahay nila while stuying. May times pa na di nako umaattend ng f2f magkasama lang kami. Yung mga out of town na lakad namin kasama pinsan nya, naka leave sila, ako may dalang laptop nasa klase habang nasa labas kami. Sinabihan ko na sya before na wag na nya ako isama kasi hindi biro ang gastos pero ayaw nya paawat. Di daw sya sasama kung di ako sasama. Pinakita ko sa nanay at tatay nya yung convo nila nung taga Houston, Di ko lang din ineexpect nung sinabi ng nanay nya na ""Ano yung assurance na kami pa din"" pagka graduate ko ang ironic na sakanila ako natutulog kasi yun yung gusto ng anak nya tapos ako na yung ginanito ako pa yung ungrateful. Tinanggap daw nila ako kasi pinaglaban daw ako ng anak nya sa kanila. 

  
Sya pa din yung pinili ko kahit na nagkaganito kami, ""Down bad"" yun yung term ng college bestie nya sakin. Talaga namang nainlove ako sa kanya kasi parehas nga kami ng views sa buhay, kaya kampante talaga ako na pagka graduate ko babawi ako sa kanya para mabigay ko yung buhay na deserve nya. Iniiwasan ko din na magka toxican kami kasi I've been to numerous toxic relationships, pagod na pagod nako sa mga krung krung na babae tanginang yan hahaha Pag magkasama kami parang walang nangyari pero pag nasa kanya kanyang na bahay kami di ko maalis sa isip ko yung magka usap sila habang magka sama kami. Ginagago ako harap harapan, sabi nya wala naman daw emotions involved. Tintry ko din na paniwalaan sya kahit na ganyan na yung nangyari hahaha ",1,1758216030.0,CasualPH,0,0.99,False

I live in the city, and I usually get coffee from a Dunkin donuts on my way to work quite often. Recently, my sister got a new job and it’s in the same area as mine. So, I take her to work each morning, and she is in the car with me while I'm getting coffee. When I order hot coffee, my sister and I each get our own. But, for iced coffee, since it is so large, we just split it instead of paying extra for more coffee than we would like to drink. It is during this time that I ask for an extra cup.  

The manager was not present. I asked the employee for the extra cup, and they handed it to me with no problem. In the next visit, I went up to the cashier and asked them for a cup. The manager stopped what they were doing and took over the transaction. They told me it would be 27 cents. I said “I am not asking for a cup of water, or a cup of ice. Just an empty cup. I have been here before and did not have to pay for an empty cup?” At that point, the manager saw other customers in line and just handed it to me grudgingly.  

In another visit, manager not present, I went to a different employee and specifically asked for “an empty medium cup”. They rolled their eyes at me, sighed and tried to charge me .43 cents while handing me an empty munchkin sized cup...When I repeated the size I asked for, they became annoyed. With another employee at a different time, I asked for a cup, literally handed the employee a dollar bill, and they just did not bother to charge me for an empty cup. 

Now, on the last two visits with the manager present, they do not pay attention to me or the employee I am talking to. But as soon as I ask for “an empty cup” ...the manager immediately stops what they are doing and takes over my transaction. Once, this manager took over and directly told me “This is not how we do things here, Next time you pay, okay?” then proceeded to hand me the cup for free since they thought it was a waste of time to ring me up for... “an empty cup” with several customers in line.  

In my most recent visit, again, I finished ordering, asked an employee for an empty cup. The manager walks over to the employee, whispers to them while pointing to the cup and takes over the transaction. They then stand over me and wait for me to pay 27 cents, while saying nothing. The location is on my way to work so I can't compromise the work routes my little sister and I have just to avoid this. Honestly, if my sister forgets her own cup, I feel like I should start saving pennies and give the manager 27 pennies each time.

The cup costs a whopping 7 cents wholesale. After paying $6 to $15 total for orders, they still act like this towards me when it is not even an option to charge for an empty cup in app or using the kiosk in store. Multiple Dunkin locations have handed me an ""empty cup"" without even a second thought.

Am I overreacting when I feel irritated or like I am being targeted? I truly dislike the way I am being treated here. Each time I go to that specific location, it becomes some issue the minute I walk in, and the employees and manager act like I am some criminal demanding that they give me a free donut.",1,1758215918.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I just wanted to share one last dev log before launch. I’ve been working tirelessly on *Gumshoe Detective Agency: The First Case* for the past few months, mainly nights and weekends, with the help of lots of coffee and flow charts, and it finally comes out on **October 9!!!**

It’s a 2-4 hour mystery game set on a 1995 computer desktop. You play as a detective trying to track down a missing heiress, digging through old emails, fake websites, lots of puzzles, and weird internet forums. It’s part cozy, part conspiracy, and full of clues. I like to think of it as *Nancy Drew meets The Roottrees are Dead meets your high school computer lab*.

If that sounds like your kind of thing, I’d love it if you wishlisted it on Steam. It really helps the algorithm in these final weeks:

There’ll be a **15% launch discount**, and the demo is still up if you want to check it out first.

Thanks to everyone here who’s answered a question, played the demo, or just encouraged me to keep going. I hope you enjoy solving the case as much as I’ve enjoyed building it.

I am grateful I do have a job in general, but it’s irrelevant from what I figured was my purpose in life and doesn’t pay enough.

I feel duped. I was always told that I just needed to go to college and get my degree and at the very least I’d be able to wrap wires or do coffee runs and work my way up the industry latter.

Beginner Creator's Guide to AI Tools (Before It's Too Late) 💰,"**Stop Throwing Money Away! Beginner Creator's Guide to AI Tools (Before It's Too Late) 💰**

Hey, friends! So, let’s have a real talk about something that’s been on my mind lately—how many of us have got our fingers in our wallets, just tossing bills away on tools that promise the moon but barely deliver? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ I mean, raise your hand if you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by all the AI tools out there, only to end up with your bank account looking sadder than a dog left at home alone. 

Here’s the kicker—there’s a way to work **smarter, not harder**, and it involves snatching up the right AI tools before you run out of dough. Let’s dive into this together!

**Why Should You Care?**  
Because you could be losing money and time that could be way better spent on pizza, coffee, or cat videos. Seriously, who doesn’t want more of those in their life? 🍕☕🐱

**Here’s the lowdown on AI tools and how to make them work for you:**

1. **Identify Your Needs**:  
   Think of AI tools as your personal sidekicks. Before you buy the cape, ask yourself:
   - What am I actually trying to achieve?
   - Can AI really help with that?
   - Am I just falling for the flashy marketing? (It happens to the best of us!)

2. **Do Your Research**:  
   Before splurging on the shiniest tool out there, check out reviews, ask around, and maybe even join a few forums. You wouldn’t buy a car without a test drive, right? 🚗

3. **Start Small**:  
   You don’t need a dozen tools to start. Pick one or two that fit your immediate goals and grow from there. Trying to master too many will make your brain feel like it's juggling flaming swords. 🔥🤹‍♂️

4. **Utilize Free Trials**:  
   Many AI tools offer free trials or have a free tier—use them! This way, you can test the waters without diving into the deep end (and draining your bank account).

5. **Learn the Basics**:  
   Invest some time in learning how the tool works. You don’t need to become an expert overnight, but understanding the features and benefits will pay off like crazy. It’s like using a cheat code in life! 🎮

6. **Network Like a Pro**:  
   Join discussions in communities like this one! Share experiences, tips, and insights with fellow creators. Who knows? One of them might have just the info you need to save cash or find that elusive perfect tool.

**A Little Example for You**:  
Just last month, I was tempted to purchase a subscription to an AI writing tool that boasted crazy claims. After a bit of research and community chatter, I discovered a free alternative that fit my needs perfectly—turns out I saved myself a nice chunk of cash that I instead used for a weekend escape with friends. Best decision ever! 🏖️💃

So, what’s your experience with AI tools? Have you found gems or total duds? Let’s chat about the ones that have transformed your content creation game—who needs to be part of the throwaway money club when we can be savvy creators, right? 🤔✨",1,1758215646.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1nke85x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1nke85x/hypothyroidism_robbed_me_of_my_youth/,Hypothyroidism robbed me of my youth,"F19, I have had Hashimoto's hypothyroidism since I was 13, and it really fucked me up. I was on a small dose of Synthroid (25 mcg) throughout high school and my levels were within range, but I was still experiencing all the symptoms - I weighed about 10 lbs more than I felt I should, and I was always tired, depressed, and unmotivated compared to my peers. I felt slow, stupid, and forgetful, and I grew extremely quiet in group settings because I couldn't think of what to say. The brain fog was horrible. I worked out regularly and constantly felt like I had to watch what I was eating because even when I ate clean, I gained weight incredibly easily. I feel like my high school years were wasted because of this condition. 

I am just shocked by the effects of being properly medicated, now at almost 20. I realized I needed an intervention when I was up 15 lbs, constantly fatigued, and pooping every other day. My face was bloated and inflamed, and I was chronically trying to fix my symptoms through diet and exercise. Despite my symptoms, my levels were in range. I did my research and pretty much had to drill my endocrinologist to up my meds. When he increased by dose to 50 mcg, I noticed increased gut motility after only 2 doses. Then my energy levels began to increase - I was able to do daily activities without becoming fatigued. I lost 15 lbs over 3 months, alongside exercise. The best part is I haven't had to restrict myself while losing the weight. I eat a balanced, nourishing diet and can still keep the weight off. I can enjoy cream and sugar in my coffee, desserts, snacks, etc.

I  really wish I had my dose increased sooner. Hashimoto's can really control your life. My dose is around 63 mcg per day now - I take 75 mcg and skip one day as prescribed. 

I'm worried about my thyroid degrading over time and becoming useless. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with this condition, and if anyone has any advice for dealing with it over time. I'm curious what you guys find helps in terms of diet, exercise, or medication.",11,1758215597.0,Hypothyroidism,2,0.92,False

The original text and the full translation can be read [here](https://sharetext.io/5b436d3b?fbclid=PAb21jcAM5GcpleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp8vqcPlcMtkfN_Dkpvmm7EYQUJXnsL40dQt_YOmS1R5rm7gw7z627xHKQj-P_aem_6P9_Oz1ImoqXiap1g3ChJQ).

# How Tarja Turunen became a meat eater?

*Tarja Turunen has spent the last two decades around the world. She has lived in Germany’s Karlsruhe, Argentina’s Buenos Aires and the last three years Spain’s Estepona. Although the woman has left Finland, Finland hasn’t left her.*

*The interview was agreed to happen in Turunen’s home, a gorgeous, detached house that was finished a few years ago. The table has a tray of Karelian pastries and Turunen offers coffee in a Marimekko mug. The living room’s dominant element is the ball chair designed by Eero Aarnio. Finnish design and dishes are all around.*

Finnishness is a part of our family. It is self-evident to my Argentinean husband Marcelo. Furthermore, the biggest fan of Karelian pastries is Marcelo, I at least enjoy the sauna more often than him.

*The years abroad have been fruitful, Turunen sees Finnishness as being only a benefit to herself both professionally and privately in her social life.*

It’s even funny that some of my fans in South America study Finnish. People abroad are interested in Finnish bands and the biggest names on the classical music side are quite familiar.

Finnishness has a positive stamp also in the sense that we’re considered a trailblazer nation.

**Argentina and steaks**

From Germany I moved to Argentina, I was with Marcelo already back then. The rhythm of life was of course totally different in the big city of Buenos Aires. It still wasn’t really a huge shock to me, I had been living a fast-paced life for years already, touring the world was a pretty good school.

Of course, I was surprised by the bureaucracy and its slowness in Argentina. The first visits to offices were quite frustrating, there were terrible queues, and it was impossible to get things going. That's where I learned that in everyday life, out of five planned things, you can only get two done at most. Stressing is absolutely not worth it.

Life in Buenos Aires is chaotic in many ways. It shows all the colors of life. I love the mix, for a country girl from Kitee, every day in Buenos Aires was an adventure.

The Argentinean food culture impressed me. I wasn't a big meat eater before. It took Marcelo years to get me to try a proper Argentine steak. Once you have it, you definitely want more, it's so good, like candy. Luckily, there is one restaurant here in Marbella where you can get quality Argentinean meat cooked just right. We go there about once a week to eat.

**To safe Spain**

Moving to Spain was a pretty natural solution for us. Most of my gigs take place in Central and Eastern Europe, flying across the ocean started to get tough. Especially when our daughter grew to the age where she could no longer go with us on all gig trips. Being separated from family is a terrible thing, living in Spain means that gig trips don't at least last for months.

Concern for Naomi's safety was the most important reason why we wanted to move to Europe. The political, economic and social situation in Argentina was in such a bad state that it caused unpleasant side effects that easily threatened people's safety. Here in the Andalusian countryside, the situation is completely different.

The Costa del Sol became our home by chance. We had never been here before, then a couple we know invited us to visit. We immediately fell in love with the area, its tranquility and lack of traffic. The idea that we had previously had of living in a big city changed quickly. It was an excellent decision, we first lived in a rented house as a test, but we soon realized that this was the place for us and started building our current home, which was completed a couple of years ago.

*Before moving to Spain, daughter was with Turunen at all her gigs, wherever they were in the world.*

Our daughter Naomi enjoyed the touring life with all her heart. Our technical staff considered her a pet, she lived like in an amusement park. The wheeled rolling boxes were Naomi's favorite. One of the roadies would lift her into the box and send her to another roadie on the other side of the stage. Oh, the joy and squealing that came from the box.

Naomi also learned the ways of a woman of the world as a little girl. It's quite amusing when she orders her own food in a restaurant in Spanish, English or Finnish. Even the waiters tend to smile when a little girl says ""check please"" with her finger raised.

**Her own accent makes her smile**

*The attitude of Spaniards towards foreigners is often considered a bit arrogant. Turunen has a totally different experience.*

When a Finn speaks Spanish to a Spaniard with an Argentinean accent, it usually evokes hilarity. It always makes for good stories and the conversation progresses in funny directions. The Andalusian dialect is extremely difficult to understand, by the way. When we were building our house, we sometimes wondered if we really spoke the same language as the workers. Marcelo speaks Spanish as his native language, but there were still great communication difficulties at times.

**Work at home**

*Turunen's home has a room that serves as a studio, rehearsal space, and creative center. The space has a grand piano, which Turunen mainly uses for composing and arranging, and the room also has complete music recording and mixing equipment. Turunen's music videos are also edited in the same place.*

Marcelo and I do practically everything ourselves. We book musicians for different sessions, I write my own songs, we produce the records together, and Marcelo sells my gigs. There's a lot of work but being your own boss gives you a certain amount of freedom with your schedules and other things. Now no outside person makes decisions related to my work for me.

*An artist's job is twofold. One part is creating new material, and the other part is presenting finished material at gigs, in the media, on records, and in other situations.*

That creative part takes up most of my time and energy. For example, after the composition and arrangement process for the album released last fall, I was completely worn out. After that kind of push, it always takes months for anything to come out at the piano.

*An artist's work is always susceptible to criticism. Turunen says that constructive criticism is an important tool for development, but she doesn't care about the shouting on social media, and she doesn't even read the comments.*

I have ears myself, but I don't trust them completely. I have maintained a Skype relationship with my Argentinian singing teacher, and even now, before the latest recording session, we had a few hours of online time. The other person hears a lot of things that you are deaf and blind to.

**Fanatic fans in Russia**

*Turunen tours all over the world. She is known everywhere, but where are the fans most fanatic?*

South American fans are quite fanatical, but in Russia the fandom is probably the fiercest. I once performed at a huge festival in Samara as a duet with a Russian rock star, and it generated a lot of positive feedback. In Russia I have been accepted as both a rock musician and a classical music performer. That is quite rare, usually the audience is clearly divided between these two genres.

**Classical and project work**

*Classical music has become increasingly important to Turunen. In the future, she believes that she will also perform considerably more classical music concerts than she does now.*

I am now in my early forties. At least in my own opinion, my voice sounds and works better now than ever before. I take good care of my voice and also of my fitness. Hopefully in the future I can achieve a significant position as a classical music performer.

*Turunen also plans all sorts of other music projects from time to time. A project focusing on electronic music is already quite far along.*

The plan is to record the last tracks for this in the coming weeks. So it's electronic music, where I use my voice like an instrument. Chill out music, not elevator music, but something calming is coming. This is a project that has been going on for years, and it's finally starting to be ready. I can't say anything about the release schedule yet, but it's coming.

I haven't thought about getting into tango, even though Satumaa was sung somewhere last summer. The promoter cheered that this could be the next successful project. Let's let that genre remain for now, at least, even though it would combine Finland and Argentina quite naturally, Turunen laughs.",9,1758215574.0,TarjaTurunen,0,1.0,False
1nke7je,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nke7je/explore_if_bottle_bright_cleaning_tablets_truly/,Explore If Bottle Bright Cleaning Tablets Truly Work on Tough Stains,"It feels like every day brings a new challenge for my water bottles, coffee thermoses, and even my camping gear. Regular scrubbing just doesn’t cut it anymore, and that’s where the Bottle Bright BB112 Cleaning Tablets swooped in to save the day for me. Granted, I was a bit skeptical at first. Such a small tablet claiming to clean stubborn coffee stains and musty odors seemed too good to be true. However, they've since earned a rightful spot in my kitchen (and camping bag) due to their effectiveness. But, I’m getting ahead of myself—let me spill the tea on these cleaning marvels.

**Design and Package Details**  
The first thing I noticed about these tablets is their compact size and clever packaging. Each box contains 12 individually packaged effervescent tablets, making them extremely handy for both home use and adventure trips. I’ve taken these along on hiking excursions, tossing a couple into my backpack without worrying about spills or leaks. Each tablet is lightweight at just 2.4 ounces, and the entire pack barely adds any heft—perfect for minimalists like me.

What I really like is that no extra equipment or tools are required for these tablets to work. The “pop-it-in-and-wait” simplicity is a godsend when I don’t have the patience to deal with scrubbing or messy liquid-based cleaners. The clear design language on the box and the environmental friendliness promise immediately stood out as key selling points for me.

**Good Aspects**  
Here’s why these tablets have become my go-to cleaning option:  

- Extremely convenient; no scrubbing required. 
- Perfect for cleaning all sorts of vessels like stainless steel bottles, hydration reservoirs, plastic containers, and coffee tumblers.  
- Eco-friendly and safe for both users and nature.   
- Individually packed, making them travel-friendly for hiking or camping trips.  

**Results After Daily Use**  
I can testify to the transformative power these tablets have had on my crusty bottles and stained coffee mugs. After filling my thermos with warm water and dropping a tablet in, I leave it to fizz and work its magic. The effervescence targets the grime inside, dislodging residue that feels impossible to reach with brushes or sponges. The smell? Instantly eliminated! It gave my hard-to-clean hydration reservoirs a fresh lease on life. I even used these to clean my plastic lunch containers, and I was surprisingly impressed by how effective they were in removing those annoying oil stains.

What sells these tablets further is their versatility. Whether it’s a wide-mouth bottle or a narrow-necked flask, they’ve proven to handle it all. For multi-use containers and outdoor enthusiasts like me who hate funky-smelling gear, this has been a game-changer.

[Check Bottle Bright BB112 Cleaning Tablets price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b06xycvdb9/)

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Their performance is impressive, to say the least. On the cleaning front, one tablet is all it takes for most bottles. Even my stainless steel coffee thermos with weeks-old stains didn’t stand a chance. What’s more, I appreciate that despite their effectiveness, the tablets don’t come laced with strong chemical odors or harmful ingredients.

They are environmentally friendly, and given my commitment to reducing my chemical footprint, this was a huge win for me. Manufactured in the USA, there’s also a satisfying layer of trust and a quality assurance factor to consider here. These aren’t just any tablets shoved into a re-brand. They’re carefully designed for high efficiency.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Like everything, they aren’t perfect. That said, some small quirks stood out after weeks of testing:  

- It sometimes requires two tablets for deeply stained or very large containers, which might reduce their cost efficiency for frequent users.  
- The fizzing action doesn’t always hold up in bottles with excessively greasy interiors; manual brushing might still be needed in such cases.  
- While the tablets don’t affect the taste of bottles after cleaning, the initial post-cleaning rinse demands a little care to ensure no residue remains.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Among similar products, the Bottle Bright Cleaning Tablets hold their ground pretty firmly. Compared to liquid cleaning solutions, they outshine due to portability and versatility. Competing brands like Steripen tablets or Dr. Brown’s cleaning kits work well but often require additional tools or careful application. These alternatives seem more restrictive in their use cases. 

Another popular option, affresh dishwasher tablets, can sometimes address bottle cleansing, but they are primarily designed for entirely different purposes and don’t match the niche-specific convenience of this product. For adventurers and busy individuals alike, the Bottle Bright options are a more portable and focused investment.

**True Value**  
I keep coming back to the usability and longevity of these tablets. As someone who’s keen on “value for effort,” this product hits a particularly sweet spot. You spend a little more for a specific solution, but it saves you time and guarantees results. What’s even better is how scalable it is for different needs—clean a mug at home, sanitize a puddle-stained water bottle after a hike, and still have some left because you don’t have to overuse them. To me, this balance adds a considerable bang for the buck.

**Large Scale, Ongoing, and Multi-Day Events**

- **BE AWARE!** It’s FSU Parents Weekend. Everything near the campus is going to be busy as hell. If you decide to go out to eat or order food from any place anywhere on that side of town, just know that it’s going to take longer than usual. Be kind to servers and hospitality staff. Tip heavily. Parents weekend means that all the servers and bartenders are getting hit on by jackasses trying to relive their glory college days, much to their children’s embarrassment.

1nke77s,https://i.redd.it/gak3o9k7hypf1.jpeg,rearchitecting archetypes,"The coffee had grown cold hours ago, but neither of them noticed. Rain drummed against the café window - one of those floor-to-ceiling glass panels that pretended walls didn't exist while still keeping the weather out. Dr. Elena Voss, architectural theorist, traced patterns on the condensation with her finger. Across from her, Marcus Chen, speculative designer and mycopunk theorist, sketched impossible geometries on napkins.

""You're drawing it again,"" Elena observed. ""That scaffold thing.""

Marcus glanced up from his napkin, where delicate lines suggested vertical gardens climbing building facades. ""It's not just scaffolding. It's the framework that reveals the framework - the meta-structure that exposes how we've been thinking about space.""

""Start from the beginning. I've read your work on living systems, but this feels different. Bigger.""

Marcus pushed his cup aside and spread three napkins across the small table. On the first, he drew a simple rectangle with a triangle on top - the house that every child draws.

""This,"" he said, tapping the drawing, ""is our prison. Not metaphorically. Literally. We live inside an archetype that's been running our civilization for millennia, and most of us can't even see its bars.""

Elena leaned forward. ""The house as universal symbol.""

""The wall as universal separator."" Marcus drew a bold vertical line through the air with his pen. ""Think about it - when we first scratched that line into the imaginal territory, we made a choice. We said: here is inside, there is outside. Here is safe, there is dangerous. Here is mine, there is yours. Four lines make a square, add a roof, suddenly you have the most powerful economic unit in human history.""

""Real estate,"" Elena murmured.

""Reality estate. We literally trade in pieces of reality carved up by lines that exist only in our collective imagination."" Marcus's second napkin showed urban sprawl from above - millions of boxes connected by grey arteries. ""From orbit, our cities look like circuit boards. We've built a planetary computer, and we're the electrical impulses running through its streets.""

Elena studied the drawing. As an architectural historian, she'd seen plenty of aerial photographs, but this framing unsettled her. ""You're suggesting the city is conscious?""



""I'm suggesting we're participating in something that's using us as much as we're using it. The archetype of the house - walls, roof, inside/outside - it replicates itself through us. We build according to its logic, and in return, it provides safety, property value, social status.""

""A deal with the devil.""

""Precisely. We wished for protection from natural forces, and now we have a planet covered in barriers. But here's the thing -"" Marcus's pen hovered over the third napkin. ""We're starting to see what that protection costs.""

Elena waited.

""Climate change. Urban heat islands. Stormwater runoff that overwhelms systems because every surface is hard, every flow redirected. We've optimized for separation so thoroughly that we've disrupted planetary systems.""

""So what's the alternative?""

Marcus began sketching on the third napkin - the same house shape, but now surrounded by delicate, organic structures. Green tendrils climbing walls. Horizontal platforms extending outward. Water flowing in visible channels.

""We don't destroy the archetype. We dress it.""

Elena stared at the sketch. ""Explain 'dressing' an archetype.""

""Think about skin layers. You have your flesh - that's you. Your clothes - second skin. Your house - third skin. But what if buildings could have a fourth skin? A living layer that mediates between the rigid interior and the chaotic exterior?""

Marcus's pen moved rapidly now, adding detail to his sketch. ""Scaffolding. But permanent scaffolding. Structural extensions that provide shading, insulation, water catchment, growing space. A living membrane that transforms how buildings interact with their environment.""

""You're talking about massive retrofits of existing structures.""

""I'm talking about evolution of the house archetype itself. Look -"" Marcus pointed to Elena's reflection in the rain-streaked window. ""You can see yourself in that glass because it's a surface. Everything we interact with is surface. The wall speaks to us through its surface. It says: 'Stay out. I'm vertical, hard, impermeable. Nothing grows here.'""

Elena touched the window. It was cold, smooth. Lifeless.

""But surfaces communicate,"" Marcus continued. ""They're interfaces between different realities. If we change the surface language of our built environment, we change the conversation between human systems and natural systems.""

""The surface as communication medium.""

""The surface as diplomatic space. Instead of walls that reject natural forces, we create surfaces that negotiate with them. Water can be caught and channeled. Plants can establish footholds. Birds can nest. The building becomes a participant in ecological processes rather than an obstacle to them.""

Elena considered this. ""You're essentially proposing we make our architecture... bilingual?""

""Multilingual. Speaking the language of human shelter, yes, but also the languages of water flow, pollinator pathways, seasonal change, community interaction. The scaffolding layer becomes a translation zone.""

""But why scaffolding specifically?"" Elena asked. ""You could propose green walls, living roofs - those already exist.""

Marcus grinned. ""Because scaffolding exposes the fundamental irony of how we build. Every building requires scaffolding during construction - a temporary framework that makes the permanent structure possible. But then we remove it. We strip away the very thing that enabled creation, leaving these naked boxes.""

""The building as failed artwork, missing its creative apparatus.""

""Exactly! The scaffold leaves an imprint in the wall - mounting points, structural relationships, spatial possibilities. It's all still there, invisible but present. What if we made scaffolding permanent again? What if we acknowledged that buildings are never actually finished, just frozen at an arbitrary moment in their development?""

Elena pulled out her phone and scrolled through architectural photos. ""Most contemporary buildings do look... incomplete. Brutally simplified.""

""They're optimized for only one function: creating interior space separated from exterior conditions. But what if buildings could be multi-functional? What if the same structure that shelters humans could also shelter other species, catch rainwater, grow food, generate energy, process waste?""

""Multi-species architecture.""

""Post-anthropocentric design. We're not the only inhabitants of urban space, just the most vocal about our needs.""



Marcus began sketching a cross-section view. ""Imagine every building wrapped in a loose, living membrane - maybe two meters of scaffolded space around the original structure. That zone becomes habitat for plants, small animals, water systems, community gardens. The building's surface area increases dramatically, but so does its capacity to provide ecological services.""

""And if every building did this...""

""The city's total surface area would expand exponentially. More photosynthesis, more transpiration, more opportunities for biological processes to establish themselves in urban environments. We'd be increasing the planet's living surface.""

Elena studied his cross-section drawing. ""This isn't just about individual buildings. You're describing urban-scale transformation.""

""Planetary-scale transformation. If the archetype changes - if children start drawing houses as boxes surrounded by scaffolded gardens - then every new structure incorporates this logic. The idea will spread like a virus through the imagination. Setting off chainreactions and positive feedbackloops.""

""But let's get practical,"" Elena said. ""How do you implement something like this? Building codes, property rights, maintenance responsibilities, liability issues...""

Marcus's expression grew serious. ""That's where the framework-of-frameworks concept becomes crucial. We need to operate at multiple scales simultaneously - individual, community, municipal, bioregional.""

He drew a series of nested circles. ""At the individual scale, it's about updating the archetype in our imagination. Making it socially unacceptable for buildings to be 'naked' - unscaffolded, ecologically disconnected.""

""Like how smoking indoors became socially unacceptable.""

""Precisely. Cultural change that shifts individual behavior. But at the community scale, we need new governance structures for managing shared infrastructure. If buildings start connecting through scaffolded networks, creating sky-bridges and community growing spaces, you need collective decision-making processes.""

Elena nodded. ""Commons management.""

""At the municipal scale, you need policy frameworks that incentivize this kind of development. Carbon credits for buildings that increase urban biodiversity. Reduced property taxes for structures that provide community services. Streamlined permitting for scaffold installations.""

""And bioregionally?""

Marcus's final circle encompassed all the others. ""Material flows. Where does all this scaffolding come from? How do we create regional economies that can supply the infrastructure for urban transformation without extracting resources from somewhere else?""

Elena was quiet for a moment, processing. ""You're describing a complete restructuring of how we understand property, architecture, and urban governance.""

""I'm describing evolution. The current system - private property, isolated buildings, extractive economics - it worked for a while. But it's not adapted to current conditions. Climate chaos, resource depletion, social fragmentation. We need architectures that can respond to uncertainty.""

""Adaptive architecture.""

""Living architecture. Buildings that grow, change, repair themselves. Communities that can reorganize spatially as their needs change. Cities that become more resilient over time instead of more brittle.""

Elena flagged the server for more coffee. The afternoon light had shifted, casting long shadows across their table. ""I want to push back on something. This sounds utopian. What about all the people who like privacy, who want their own space, who don't want to share community gardens and collective decision-making?""

Marcus laughed. ""That's the beauty of working with archetypes instead of against them. We're not eliminating private space - we're adding shared space. The house still protects what it's always protected. But now it also connects to something larger.""

""Concentric privacy.""

""Think of it like... urban campfires. You can retreat to your private dwelling whenever you want. But there's also shared space immediately outside your door - scaffolded terraces where neighbors might be tending plants or children might be playing. And beyond that, community spaces for larger gatherings. And beyond that, connections to other community networks.""

Elena visualized this. ""Like Russian dolls of belonging.""

""But flexible. Someone who wants maximum privacy can minimize their interaction with shared spaces. Someone who wants maximum community can spend most of their time in collective areas. The architecture accommodates different personality types and life phases.""

""And economically?""

""That's where it gets interesting. The scaffolded zone generates value - food production, energy generation, water catchment, carbon sequestration. But it's value that gets shared among the community rather than extracted by distant investors.""

Marcus pulled out his phone and showed Elena a photo. ""This is from Barcelona - community-managed superblocks where residents have transformed streets into gardens and play spaces. Property values went up, but so did quality of life for everyone in the neighborhood.""

Elena studied the image. Children playing in what used to be parking spaces, elderly residents chatting under trellised vines, young adults working in elevated garden beds. ""It does look... livable.""

""Now imagine if that same logic extended vertically. If every building could contribute to and benefit from neighborhood-scale ecological systems.""

""You mentioned earlier that this works at the level of imagination,"" Elena said. ""How do you actually change an archetype?""

Marcus considered this. ""Art. Story. Example. You make the invisible visible through creative practice. You tell stories that help people imagine different possibilities. And you build demonstration projects that show how those possibilities might work in practice.""

""Speculative architecture.""

""Speculative everything. Architecture, governance, economics, social organization. But grounded in current constraints - not fantasy scenarios where all the problems are magically solved.""

Elena leaned back in her chair. ""So someone builds a pilot project. A building wrapped in permanent scaffolding, producing food and energy, managing its own water systems. And other people see it working, start to imagine similar projects in their own neighborhoods.""

""And municipal governments start adapting building codes to accommodate scaffold installations. And material suppliers start developing products specifically for living architecture systems. And communities start forming around shared infrastructure management.""

""Viral transformation.""

""Cultural evolution. The archetype updates itself through collective practice. Like how the internet changed from a military communication system to a global social infrastructure - nobody planned that transformation, but it emerged through millions of individual adoptions.""

Marcus gestured toward the window, where evening shadows were beginning to lengthen. ""Look at this street. Every building isolated in its own lot, surrounded by unused space - setbacks, parking, decorative landscaping that serves no ecological function. Imagine all that space activated for community use and ecological services.""

Elena tried to envision it: scaffolded extensions connecting buildings, vertical gardens filtering air and managing stormwater, neighborhood-scale food production visible from the sidewalk. ""It would look completely different.""

""It would function completely differently. Less energy consumption because of improved insulation and shading. Less stormwater problems because of increased absorption and transpiration. More biodiversity because of expanded habitat. More community resilience because of local food production and shared resources.""

""And more beautiful?""

Marcus smiled. ""That depends on your aesthetic preferences. But I think most people would find living systems more visually interesting than blank walls.""

Elena checked her phone. They'd been talking for over three hours. ""I want to circle back to something you said earlier - about this being a framework of frameworks. How does scaffold architecture relate to other systems of thought?""

Marcus pulled out a fresh napkin and began drawing interconnected circles. ""Scaffolding is just the physical manifestation of a broader approach to systems design. You can apply the same logic to social organization, economic relationships, information systems, ecological restoration.""

""Pattern language.""

""Meta-pattern language. Christopher Alexander identified patterns that create livable spaces, but this is about patterns that create adaptive systems - systems that can learn and evolve over time.""

Elena studied his new diagram. ""Give me an example in social organization.""

""Community assemblies. Instead of representative democracy where you elect someone to make decisions for you, or direct democracy where everyone votes on everything, you create scaffolded decision-making. Small groups make decisions about local issues, but they're connected to larger groups that handle regional concerns, which connect to bioregional networks for planetary-scale challenges.""

""Nested sovereignty.""

""Exactly. Each scale of organization handles the decisions it's best equipped for, but information and resources flow between scales as needed. It's like how your body coordinates between cells, tissues, organs, and systems - lots of local autonomy, but integrated coordination.""

Elena nodded slowly. ""And economically?""

""Gift economies scaffolded onto market economies scaffolded onto commons management. You use whatever exchange mechanism works best for each type of relationship. Sharing tools with immediate neighbors, trading surplus production with other communities, managing shared infrastructure through commons governance.""

""Multiple economic languages.""

""Multiple everything. The framework-of-frameworks approach recognizes that complex problems require multiple approaches working in coordination. You don't solve urban sustainability with just technology, or just policy, or just behavior change. You need all of them working together in ways that reinforce each other.""

The café was beginning to empty around them. Elena gathered the sketched napkins, studying the progression from simple house archetype to complex living systems.





""This feels like we're talking about civilizational transformation.""

""We are. But starting from the most basic level - how we think about walls, space, inside and outside. If you change the foundational patterns, everything built on those patterns eventually changes too.""

""How long would something like this take?""

Marcus considered. ""Look at how quickly people adopted smartphones, or social media, or online shopping. When something provides obvious benefits and the infrastructure exists to support it, cultural adoption can happen very rapidly.""

""But this requires physical infrastructure changes.""

""Which creates jobs, stimulates economic activity, improves quality of life for everyone involved. It's not like asking people to sacrifice for some abstract future benefit - it's offering immediate improvements in daily life.""

Elena tried to imagine her own neighborhood transformed this way. Her apartment building wrapped in productive scaffolding, connected to neighboring buildings through community growing spaces, integrated into bioregional networks for resource sharing. ""It sounds... hopeful.""

""It sounds possible. That's what I find most compelling about working with archetypes - you're not trying to impose some external vision on people, you're helping them recognize possibilities that already exist within their existing frameworks.""

Marcus showed Elena his phone again, this time a photo from a recent project in Mexico City. ""Community-built scaffold extensions on social housing - productive gardens, water catchment, informal economy spaces, childcare areas. All added to existing buildings by residents themselves.""

""It looks organic. Like it grew there.""

""Because it did. When you provide the framework and the tools, communities figure out how to adapt them to local conditions. That's what makes this approach scalable - it doesn't require centralized planning or standardized solutions.""

Elena looked around the café, noting its own architectural details with fresh eyes. Exposed ceiling beams that might once have supported scaffolding. Large windows that blurred interior and exterior boundaries. Communal tables that encouraged conversation between strangers. ""Even this space reflects some of these principles.""

""Good public space always does. It provides structure while allowing for spontaneous activity. It connects people while respecting individual autonomy. It serves multiple functions without overwhelming any single purpose.""

""Scaffolded social space.""

""And that's where the framework gets really interesting - when you start applying it to information systems, educational approaches, healing practices. How do you create structures that support growth without constraining it?""

Elena gathered her things, but remained seated. ""I keep thinking about children's drawings of houses. If kids started drawing scaffolded houses - buildings surrounded by gardens and connected to their neighbors - what would that generation build when they grew up?""

""Exactly the question that keeps me awake at night. In the best possible way.""

Marcus stood and stretched. Outside, the city hummed with its evening rhythms - people moving between buildings, lights flickering on in windows, the invisible infrastructure of utilities and communications maintaining the urban metabolism. ""Every building out there is a frozen moment in someone's imagination. Someone drew it, planned it, built it according to their understanding of what architecture should do.""

""And now?""

""Now we get to imagine differently. We get to draw houses surrounded by living systems. We get to build structures that support both human communities and ecological communities. We get to create frameworks that help other people imagine possibilities we haven't even thought of yet.""

Elena finally stood, napkins in hand. ""The framework of frameworks.""

""The architecture of becoming.""

They walked toward the café entrance, past other tables where other conversations were probably solving other problems, or at least trying to understand them better. At the door, Elena paused.

""One more question. What happens when everyone's house is scaffolded? When every building is wrapped in living systems and connected to community networks? What does the city become then?""

Marcus pushed open the door, letting in the evening air - warmer than it should be for this time of year, carrying scents of exhaust and distant green spaces and the possibility of rain. ""I don't know. That's what makes it worth trying.""

It works out very well because it allows me to take my kids to school in the morning, come home and start work and then pick them up on my lunch break. My wife works at an office but her workday starts about an hour after mine. 

A typical day looks like this: I get up at 6:30am and get the kids ready for school. I take them to school at 7:30am. I get home around 8:00, make some coffee, and then start my work day at 8:30am. 

During this time, my wife is still asleep. We typically go to bed around the same time every night. 

Most of the time, I also use that time between 8 and 8:30 to prepare lunch for my wife. Sometimes either she or I have packed something the night before but if it's something like a sandwich, then I'll make it fresh right before she leaves. However, I can't *always* do this. 

Today, I dropped my kids off at school when one of them noticed they forgot their lunch bag. We live fairly close, so I could go home, grab the lunch bag, and bring it to the school for her. This, however, had me getting home at almost exactly 8:30.  I had made my wife well aware that this week is going to be hectic and I will be swamped with work all week, so this shouldn't have come as a surprise. But my wife, as she typically does, didn't get out of bed until just a few minutes before she had to leave, giving her just enough time to get dressed, do her hair, put on makeup, and head out the door. She has a history of having problems with punctuality and has for as long as I've known her. She asked me to put her lunch together because she didn't have time, but I reminded her that I was swamped and literally couldn't spare a minute, much less the several minutes it would take to go do that.   
  
My job is very deadline-based, so there are times I need to be working on a certain task by a certain time, and it needs to be done. If I don't do my job, many other people can't do theirs, and it would hold up our whole process. I hold a senior position with 10 years at my company, so it's unlikely I'd be fired if I missed a single deadline, but it's not something I want to do if I can help it. I can be frustrating when she acts like I can always just drop what I'm doing. 

As she left, she said, ""I don't know why you care so much about this company you work for; you should care more about your family."" and then walked out the door. 

I feel like that's unfair because I believe I have an excellent track record when it comes to caring about my family. I've often thought about asking her to be the one to get up and take the kids while \*I\* sleep sometimes, but I never do because in the end I am glad she's able to get extra sleep before she heads to a job where she's on her feet all day. Yet somehow she thinks IATA for making work a priority in this rare situation. Is she right?

I arrived at the Rook Island Lighthouse this morning. The helicopter flight from the mainland was a jarring and bumpy 45-minute flight over open ocean. I’ve never been on a helicopter before, and I’m not sure what I was expecting, but the sea winds were pushing us around pretty good on the way over. Amund, the pilot, told me twice during the trip that we might have to abort and try again when the weather was calmer, but he kept us moving and eventually we arrived at my destination.

He’d been pretty talkative when we’d first met and even more so when we lifted off from the helipad at the port, but that seemed to fade the closer we got to Rook Island. He’d filled me in on a little of the history of the place to pass the time – how the current lighthouse was actually the *second* one to stand on that rocky outcropping. According to him, the first had been built sometime in the early seventeen hundreds and had been completely wiped out by a nasty winter storm in 1803, taking all three men stationed there with it. Another, more modern design had been erected after that, which was the foundation of the current Rook Island Lighthouse. He’d also made some brief mentions of how even that original lighthouse had been built upon the foundations of some old, secluded abbey, but the weather started getting rougher by then, and he was focused more on flying the helicopter than chatting.

I wasn’t too sure about what he was telling me, honestly. Sure, I could buy that there had been another lighthouse before this one, but an *abbey*? Out here?

Nah – I call bullshit.

I was pretty sure he was jerking my chain. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to probe any further after that, because the lighthouse appeared before us at that point, a little dot of white emerging from the haze of rain and mist in the otherwise endless ocean below.

How the hell do they even build lighthouses way out here in the middle of nowhere?

The winds had been pushing us around even more forcefully as we approached, but Amund was able to land us on the small helipad that had been retrofitted to the lighthouse roof with only a bit of struggle. He tried to maintain his ever-present calm demeanor, but I didn’t miss the beads of sweat and the occasional grimaces of concentration as we settled on the pad.

Even after we’d touched down, he seemed on-edge. His eyes never stopped moving and he never took his hands from the controls. Just gave me a nod after we’d settled on the deck – my signal to get moving.

I hopped out, grabbed my bags, and climbed down through the trapdoor in the helipad, ducking under the rotor wash and careful of my footing on the rain-slick surface. As soon as I was safely below, he was up and gone again, the bright orange and yellow helicopter fading into the gray sky as it made its way back to land.

The lighthouse isn’t what I expected.

I was envisioning a quaint little island, maybe covered in green grass and with a cozy old cottage standing nearby. Typical post-card stuff.

Rook Island isn’t that sort of lighthouse.

It rises like some pale skeletal finger from the depths, jutting out from the angry sea atop a narrow pillar of rock. From the air, I could see the dark shadow of the submerged shoal surrounding it, an underwater island that couldn’t quite reach the surface. Beyond the jagged edges of the shoal, the water turned indigo and then black as it fell away to thousands of feet of murky depth.

The lighthouse was a slender tower built atop that rocky outcropping, battered and scarred from two hundred years of dutiful service and countless repairs.

Amund told me that, before they had built the helipad on the roof, lighthouse keepers arrived on boats at a small dock, the ruins of which were still visible at the base of the rocks. A narrow and precarious staircase, long since taken by the seas, had been the only means of entrance or escape from the island at that time. There were only small and infrequent windows of opportunity to safely approach the island by boat, and it wasn’t uncommon for the storms to make that approach impossible for weeks on end.

According to the pilot, more than one keeper had lost their lives to the churning waters here over the years. Bodies never found.

I guess when the sea takes a man, it’s not too keen on giving him back.

Things were different now, of course. The lighthouse had been automated back in the 90’s, and now the only people that came out here were the small crews that visited a few times a year to perform maintenance.

That’s us.

Well, technically, it’s only me right now. My partner, Calvin Sykes, missed his connecting flight yesterday and won’t be here until tomorrow.

So here I am, watching the helicopter disappear into the distance as I stand on the widows walk around the lamp room, with only the sounds of the wind and crashing of the waves against the rocks below me.

For all that noise, why does it seem so quiet?

My first job with this company. My first time in a lighthouse at all, and I’m all by myself in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight.

You know, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so alone.

 

September 2^(nd), 9:30AM

What a shitty night.

As it turns out, the weather only got worse when the sun went down yesterday. The gray clouds turned to black, and the rain came down so heavily that I could actually feel the vibrations from it in the wooden floor of the sleeping quarters.

The wind didn’t help. It battered against the windows and churned up the water below into violent whitecaps and huge swells crashing over the island. The howling was more than a little unnerving, but I kept telling myself it was just the way the gale moved around the rocks and the tower. I tried not to think of what it would have been like for those men who had been swept away by the seas all those years ago. I can’t imagine a more terrifying way to go out.

Needless to say, I didn’t get much sleep. For the first time in recent memory, my night was filled with disturbing dreams. I can’t remember them this morning, but I woke with an unsettled stomach and a constant feeling of anxiousness. I thought it best to avoid coffee and instead settled for a granola bar and some water. There’s a chair and a small desk up in the lamp room, so I’m sitting up here right now watching out over the water and listening to the quiet hum of the mechanism behind me as it slowly rotates the beacon.

The storm passed sometime in the night, but the sun is still blocked out by heavy cloud cover and the whitecaps of the ocean make me think it may get worse before it clears.

Calvin should be here this afternoon, so I’m sure I’ll be more at ease once he arrives and we start our work. According to company safety rules, there has to be at least two people present before I can do anything here, so I’m just trying to relax until he gets here.

By this time next week, I’ll be on a flight back home.

 

September 2^(nd), 12:30PM

Well, that’s just *great*.

Just got word over the radio that the weather back at the port has gotten worse. Low visibility, heavy wind and rain, and thunder and lightning. No flights today, and maybe not tomorrow either.

I talked to Calvin a little over the radio. He sounded a little frustrated and told me that there’d been a screw-up – some sort of miscommunication. Apparently, I wasn’t supposed to be out here by myself. Company safety policy was pretty clear on that part – I should have waited for him. He assured me it wasn’t my fault and I wasn’t in any sort of trouble – someone else should have known better.

In the end, there wasn’t anything to do about it now, and he told me to just sit tight and enjoy the scenery. He made a point of reinforcing the safety rules that that I should keep to the upper levels until he arrives; that it isn’t safe for one person to go sightseeing in the lower levels all alone. There was too much risk of injury in this old tower. That’s fine with me, I told him. The view up in the lamp room is pretty good.

I’m not happy about it, but I’m still getting paid whether I’m changing bulbs, repainting railings, cleaning bird shit off the stairs, or sitting on my butt. So, at least that’s something.

I brought a book and have some movies on my tablet, so I’m sure I can keep myself entertained.

Hopefully, the weather will break, and Calvin will be here tomorrow.

 

September 2^(nd), 6:42PM

I did some exploring of the lighthouse today, despite Calvin’s warnings. I figure he was just making sure he was covering the company’s ass if I slip and break an ankle, but what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him, and truth be told, I’m getting bored.

Most of the upper floors are cramped and crowded with equipment. The battery room is barely large enough for a man to squeeze between the banks of cells, and the kitchen/sitting room feels claustrophobic. There’s an old TV and DVD player hanging above the refrigerator, but it looks like it hasn’t been used in twenty years. It’s not like I brought any DVDs with me anyway.

The sleeping quarters are below that, with six compact bunks built against the cylindrical walls of the lighthouse. They have a curve to them, but they’re just large enough that you can sleep in them comfortably. Since I’m the only one here, I don’t have to fight anyone to get a bottom bunk, which is nice.

The lower floors are larger, since the conical shape of the tower expands outward down towards its base, but even there, the generators and electrical equipment take up most of the free space. There’s just not a whole lot of room to spread out in here. Even the bathroom on the floor below the bunk room is tiny, just a toilet and a narrow shower stall and some storage cabinets.

On the ground floor, just below the generator room, there’s an old, rust-speckled iron door leading outside the lighthouse. This must be where the old keepers used to come through. It’s barred and locked from the inside, but I was able to get it open and step out onto the narrow steel landing at the head of the now-missing staircase.

Twisted railings and two heavily corroded steps are all that remain of the stairs, and when I worked up the nerve to creep closer to the edge, I found myself staring down a hundred feet of jagged and slick rocks to the pounding black seas below. I couldn’t imagine having to brave the steps that had once been there, especially with the gusting wind that was trying its damnedest to peel me off the platform. Even with a firm grip on the doorframe, I didn’t feel comfortable staying out there long, and quickly went back inside, replacing the bars and locking the door when I went.

A spiral staircase descended even lower than this floor, and I figured it probably led to either a cistern or more fuel storage. I decided to save that for later; my clothes were soaked through now, thanks to the rain and the sea spray, and I was shivering from my brief excursion outside. I decided to head back upstairs, change into some warm clothes, and heat myself up some freeze-dried dinner. Maybe watch a movie on my tablet, sip a glass of the whiskey I’d smuggled along.

I’ll record more later.

 

September 3^(rd), 8:25AM

Okay, so apparently, I was more tired than I thought yesterday. After I ate dinner (which was surprisingly good for freeze-dried beef stroganoff), I went to my bunk with my tablet and, well, honestly, don’t remember anything after that.

The next thing I do remember was waking up in the middle of the night to another storm that had blown in – big surprise there. It’s funny, but even after only a couple days here, I’m starting to get used to the creaking and groaning sounds the lighthouse makes in bad weather.

At some level, it almost seems familiar and comforting. My tablet had slipped off my chest and found its way to the floor at some point, so I sat up and placed it on the nearby table. I was getting ready to lay back down and get back to sleep when an out-of-place sound wound its way up from somewhere downstairs. It was a low groaning sound, almost a vibration, with a higher pitched squeal riding just below the surface.

It sounded a lot like rusty hinges, and I wondered if I’d neglected to secure the external door when I came back in earlier in the day. Begrudgingly, I slipped on my shoes and grabbed my flashlight and went downstairs. I didn’t want to turn on the lights, for fear of chasing away any chance I might have to go back to sleep afterwards.

I knew if the door had blown open, the storm would find its way in and soak everything. For my first job with the company, I sure as hell didn’t want to be responsible for flooding the lower levels, so I figured I needed to check it out and make sure everything was good.

I’m not gonna lie; going down those curving metal stairs with only my flashlight to guide me, in the middle of a storm and surrounded by an angry sea, was more than a little unnerving. I thought briefly about how the first lighthouse had been completely destroyed by a winter storm, but pushed that thought from my head and focused on my footing.

Now, I’m not a skittish person by nature. I’ve done plenty of jobs that found me all alone in remote places, and I’ve never once worried about anything other than whether or not I was able to get the job done on schedule or what I was going to eat for dinner.

I pride myself on being rational. I’m not afraid of things that go bump in the night. After all, there’s nothing there in the dark that isn’t there in the light, but even so, I could feel that growing sense of anxiousness trying to find root in the back of my mind. It was like an unfamiliar whisper telling me to go back up and get back into my bunk.

*Nothing to see here. Move along.*

So down I went, stubborn as ever.

Even before I reached the door, I knew it couldn’t have been open. The creaking sound didn’t reoccur, and the howl of the wind was still thankfully a muted roar, insulated by the thick walls of the lighthouse. Still, I’d come this far, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep unless I put eyes on it and checked for myself.

Sure enough, the door was still barred and locked, vibrating and occasionally rattling against its frame from the fury of the wind outside. Giving it a final once-over to reassure myself that all was well, I turned to head back upstairs.

No idea what that sound was, but regardless, at least it wasn’t anything I did. I’m not supposed to be down there by myself and I’m not looking to get fired on my first outing with this company for flooding the lighthouse.

That was last night. This morning, I’ve already had my first coffee and some toast and I’m sitting at the table in the lamp room right now, looking out over the ocean. The storm has lessened in the hours since last night, but it’s still raining and blowing outside and the clouds are still low and gray.

I’m no meteorologist, but I’m fairly confident I won’t be meeting my partner today, either.

I’m starting to wonder if this job was a good idea. I feel like I’m a million miles away from home.

Anyway, I’m going to finish another cup of coffee and head on downstairs to poke around a bit more. It’ll do me some good to have something to do.

More to come…

 

It’s… um… 9:45AM – same day

*I don’t understand. I…I just...*

*This can’t be real…*

*I mean… I must be losing my mind – that’s the only explanation, right?*

*Shit.*

*I can’t do this right now.*

 

September 3^(rd), 11:00AM

Okay. I’ve had a couple glasses of whiskey, and I’ve calmed down a bit – enough to do this recording of what happened, anyway. My thoughts are fragmented, but I’ll try my best to make sense for anyone who’s listening to these recordings.

I’ll try to just start from the beginning and take it one step at a time.

After I finished my coffee, I went downstairs like I said, turning my attention to the concrete steps that descended further down from the ground level and continuing my exploration from yesterday.

As I suspected, the floor below – what you’d call the basement level, I guess - was occupied by a large fuel tank, but what I didn’t expect was to find another door and more steps leading even farther downward.

This was different than I’d seen before, though. It wasn’t painted wood or even a solid metal door like the exterior entrance had been, but instead was a wrought iron gate, ornately fashioned and looking more like it belonged in a castle dungeon or something. The center of it was embellished with a large iron crucifix, covering half the gate. I can’t say why, but for some reason, I found it strangely… I don’t know – foreboding is the word, I guess.

The gate had actually been half-hidden by some old cargo netting hanging on the wall of the basement level and I hadn’t noticed it at first. I pulled the netting away and took a closer look.

Through the iron bars, the beam of my flashlight illuminated rough steps, carved into the gray rock of the island itself. They spiraled downward and out of sight, so I couldn’t see very far, but my light reflected from the moisture-slick walls and surfaces of the steps. Standing in front of the door, I could smell the cool, musty air that wafted up from somewhere below. It smelled old and stale, like a museum or a stuffy library basement. It was the odor of things hidden away and forgotten.

I wondered exactly what reason anyone might have had to dig deeper in the heart of the island, and how far down the stairwell might actually go.

There was no key in the lock, but when I tugged on the door, it swung outward with a little resistance, and my stomach lurched at the all-too-familiar groaning and screeching that rose from its rusted hinges. There was no mistaking that sound; it was the same as I’d heard last night. I told myself that it had been just the door swinging lightly back and forth, pushed around by the pressure changes caused by the storm.

It sounded good at the time.

With more apprehension than I’m comfortable admitting, I forced myself to investigate further, carefully making my way down this new stairwell. The steps were slick with moisture and a greenish-black mold that covered most of their surface. They were uneven and steep, clearly carved by an inexpert hand and looking much older than the rest of the lighthouse. The centers of them were worn and smoothed as if by hundreds of years and countless footsteps.

As I went, the air grew colder and more humid, and after a bit, I had descended far enough that I was sure I must have been below sea level. The walls were hewn with the same rough construction as the steps, and the arched ceiling was barely tall enough to allow me to pass without stooping.

Although I didn’t keep track, it was at least ten or fifteen minutes that I went down in that spiral tunnel, growing more uncomfortable with each step. This stairwell was so out of place with the more modern construction above that I was sure it must have predated the lighthouse by some time.

Maybe it was a part of the original lighthouse, I’d thought. Hell, maybe even from that unlikely abbey that the pilot had mentioned.

When the stairwell finally reached the bottom, I felt like I had gone a hundred feet or more below the surface of the rocky island, and the thought of being surrounded by all that black ocean made me more than a little uncomfortable. Down there, I could feel the vibrations of the seas as they battered against the stones outside, could hear the muted thunder of their crashing in deep echoes.

The room I found myself in was larger than I might have expected – probably fifty feet across. In the center of that stone room was a small wooden table and chair, both made from heavy dark wood and obviously old.

An antique oil lamp sat atop the damp surface of the table, its glass shield soot-stained around the top and encrusted with the long-dried remains of its fuel. In the center of the table, a thick, leather-bound book lay open, though the years and moisture had turned the pages to little more than a mass of blackened decay, making it impossible to identify what it might have been.

A bible, maybe? I’m not sure.

I swung the flashlight in the area around the table and found it otherwise empty of furniture, but not of decoration. The walls were smoother than those of the stairwell I’d come through, and though heavily stained with streaks and blotches of mildew and mold, I could see the time-faded remains of pastel murals covering them.

I can’t say why, but an uneasy feeling had settled over me, almost as if I’d found a place I wasn’t supposed to. Like I was trespassing somewhere I wasn’t welcome. Pushing it aside, I wandered a little closer to the walls, examining more closely the artwork and trying to discern what it depicted. The scenes were so corrupted by the wet environment that I couldn’t make out any details, but the whole thing had the feel of those elaborate frescos I’d seen in old churches.

Turning away from the paintings, I swept my light over the whole of the room again, the bright beam cutting a narrow tunnel through the gloom, tiny motes and moisture sparkling in the light. My breath hitched and my heart jumped to my throat when it suddenly found the two motionless forms kneeling upon the floor and facing a section of the wall.

I let out a spontaneous curse at the sight, shocked to find I wasn’t alone in this dark place. Instinctively, I leapt back, keeping the flashlight trained on the huddled forms. I stood rooted to that spot a long while, the beam from my light shaking in my hand and my feet ready to take flight at any second. When some time had passed without anything happening, I finally worked up the courage to move a little closer.

What I saw only added to my confusion. What knelt before me were the skeletal remains of two nuns, their old-fashioned habits hanging loosely upon their still-erect frames. Their fleshless skulls were slightly downturned, as if they’d died in prayer, and the bleached bones of their hands still clutched what appeared to be rosaries and crucifixes. The fabric and design of their vestments, though plain and coarse, marked them as catholic nuns, or of some related sect. At least, that was my guess.

It was obvious they’d been here for a long time – maybe centuries, dying where they knelt in eternal watch. I couldn’t understand why they hadn’t crumbled to piles of bone and cloth in all that time, and my mind continued to rebel against my presence here. Every ounce of my body felt that pull – the insistence that I leave this place immediately and never return.

Still, I focused on my breathing and forced my thoughts to calm, turning the whole thing over with logical set.

Yes, there were bodies. But they were *old*. It wasn’t like I’d just tripped across a murder scene. If this place had once been a hermitage convent or abbey, it only made sense that there might be some remnants of their existence. I told myself that this was a holy place, a place where the pious sequestered themselves from the rest of humanity to focus their devotions without worldly distraction. If anything, this was a historical place that should be studied by scholars, not a place of irrational fear.

I told myself all this, and it helped a little. Enough for my curiosity to take the lead once again and my racing heart to ease a bit.

Reluctantly turning my light from the two sisters, I focused it on the section of wall before them, where their attentions had been focused in their vigil.

It was there I spied the door. It was cleverly concealed under the decorations of the mural, but the thick wood had swollen and warped with the moisture and now stood a little proud of the wall. It looked like there had once been a handle of some sort to pull it open, but now there was only a hole where it had once been mounted.

I pulled at it tentatively before I realized that there were heavy black iron nails running around the border of the rotting wood and into the frame. I can’t say why, but I felt compelled to investigate further. This had obviously been the subject of the nuns’ attentions and had been important enough for them to remain in prayer until their dying breaths. I couldn’t imagine what might lay beyond that door.

I grabbed the multitool from my back pocket and flipped open the pliers, going to work pulling the nails out one at a time and letting them drop with dull rings to the floor. When I was done, I stepped back a moment and looked over the surface, making sure I hadn’t missed any.

I hesitated a beat, something almost instinctual – a primitive stirring at the back of my mind – telling me to leave it alone.

Ignoring that voice, I carefully hooked a finger through the hole in the door and pulled, abruptly jerking my hand away at the slimy, spongy feel of the wood. It felt uncomfortably warm and somehow, *sickly –* almost like I had touched something alive. I grimaced and scrubbed my hand against my jeans in revulsion.

The door swung open slowly with a scraping protest until there was enough room for me to step inside. When I did, a soft current of fetid air blew past me, smelling of stagnation and age and something else that I couldn’t place.

Something *wrong*.

This is where I begin to wonder if I’ve lost my grip on sanity. The interior of this room was undecorated, the walls the same slimy gray as the stairwell had been. But it was what my flashlight revealed within that demanded my immediate attention.

There, chained to the far wall with thick iron shackles, stood the desiccated and unmistakable remains of a man. He had been huge – every bit of seven feet tall, and grotesquely deformed. Even though the flesh had long since shrunk and withered, taking on a gray hue mottled with angry red splotches, I could see clearly the unnatural protrusions covering the whole of his remains, pushing out from beneath the leathery skin as if they were trying to escape. The skeleton beneath was twisted and malformed.

Across the wall behind the figure, it looked like someone had painted huge, outstretched wings in a powdery black medium – charcoal or something like that. It almost looked burned into the surface of the stone wall, like someone had painted it with gunpowder and then ignited it. Those wings must have been twelve feet across and depicted in a fashion that made me think of something reptilian or maybe bat-like, with membranes of skin instead of feathers. It gave the whole scene an even more sinister and unsettling air.

I’m not sure how, but the corpse still stood upright as it had in life, with arms outstretched and bound by the heavy iron restraints. Its head, abnormally large and bulbous, hung upon its chest limply, its features downcast and hidden from view. How long had this man suffered here before his death?

What terrible thing had he done to deserve this?

What was this place?

Before I had time to contemplate this any further, something happened that I still can’t explain and is the reason my hands are still shaking right now.

It moved.

The fucking thing actually *moved*. With the rustling and creaking sound of dried leather stretched taut, the head lifted slowly from its chest, and black pits that once held eyes fixed on me. A wave of nausea swept over me like a cold wash, and I started hyperventilating. Intense flashes of sickening revulsion and raw fear spiked painfully in my mind for a blinding moment, like nothing I have ever felt before. I put my hands to my head, as if that would help ward off this onslaught of pain, but it didn’t shield me at all.

Stumbling backwards blindly, I tripped and fell hard in the doorway, cutting my hand painfully on the discarded iron nails and scattering them across the floor. I was only there for a second, though, because the next thing I knew, I had scrambled to my feet and was running back up the winding staircase as fast as I could, hands against the disgusting slickness of the mold and algae to steady my flight. All I could hear was the thudding of my heartbeat in my temples and the rasping of my breath.

When I reached the iron gate, I rushed through and slammed it hard behind me, turning then and peering through the bars into the swirling darkness below. I strained hard to see or hear anything, and after a few moments, the sound of slow and wet breathing drifted up from that stygian abyss.

I thought I heard – though I can’t swear to it – the faint metallic sound of heavy chains striking the stoney floor somewhere in the shadowed depths, and that nausea returned, almost physically pushing me away from the door and chasing me back up through the levels of the lighthouse above.

I didn’t stop until I found myself in the lamp room at the top of the lighthouse, dropping heavily into the chair and resting my head on the table, trying to catch my breath.

It took me longer than it should have to realize that the room was quiet, other than the muted sounds of the wind and the sea. The beacon was no longer rotating behind its lenses. The light was no longer lit, and it felt for all the world like something momentous had just changed.

What the hell is going on?

 

September 3^(rd), 6:45PM

They’re not coming, and they’re not answering my radio calls anymore. I know they’re still there, listening, but they won’t answer me. Won’t tell me why.

I’d been trying to raise someone – *anyone –* on the radio for hours with no answer. I’d just about given up trying when my radio crackled and the voice of Calvin Sykes, the man who was supposed to be my new partner, came through. His tone was flat, but I didn’t miss the hint of frustration in it. Maybe a little disappointment, too.

He said that the light had gone out, like that meant something special that I didn’t understand. He told me that I’d been warned to stay out of the lower levels. Didn’t *ask* me if I’d disobeyed his instructions – somehow, he just *knew*. Said that I was a part of it now. That there wasn’t anything they could do – they had no choice. Nothing could come off the island now. Something about the *forsaken* and *the nameless,* but he’d lost me by that point.

I have no earthly idea what he was rambling about, but I understood the gist of what he was telling me – they weren’t coming for me.

Then he asked if I was a religious man. I told him I wasn’t, and he didn’t say anything for a long time. When he spoke again, it was only a couple of words filtering through the static.

*I’m sorry.*

That’s it. That’s all he said, and that’s the last time I heard his or anyone else’s voice over the radio.

I don’t know what’s going on – what it is that I’m supposed to be *a part of.*

I just know that I’m all alone out here, with no way off this damned island. The sun is starting to go down now, and the storm is getting worse than I’ve seen since I’ve been here. The sky has a strange green tint to it and the wind is starting to sound like voices swirling around outside.

I just want to go home, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.

It was a Thursday mid-morning, right before Ramadan. I was standing in the gleaming lobby of Bahrain Financial Harbour, nervously sipping my Arabic coffee (the server even added a slight sprinkle of cardamom—nice touch). Entrepreneurs bustled through the marble-floored atrium, some clutching company formation papers, others deep in animated majlis-style chats. That was the day I realized: Bahrain isn’t just an entry point to the Gulf—it’s a business launchpad with free zones crafted for agility, growth, and big ambitions.\

Why Bahrain Over UAE or Saudi Arabia?\
\
Lower entry costs, faster government processing\
No annual “sponsor” retainer\
More direct access to Saudi Arabia and GCC via causeway\
Friendlier business customs (majlis meetings, coffee chat negotiations)\
\
A brief tangent: While some founders worry Bahrain isn’t as “flashy” as Dubai, that’s a strategic advantage. Meetings get to the point. Relationship-building (yes, even via WhatsApp) can often move things faster than in larger, more bureaucratic Gulf neighbors.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New for Free Zones and Company Formation?\
The MOICT’s latest circular (January 2025) now mandates digital notarization for all corporate documents—no more paper-only submissions. This cuts turnaround times by up to 30%, but only if you use approved MOICT e-notary partners.\
Actionable advice: Book online e-notary slots before submitting your formation package to stay ahead of the rush.\

I arrived at the Rook Island Lighthouse this morning. The helicopter flight from the mainland was a jarring and bumpy 45-minute flight over open ocean. I’ve never been on a helicopter before, and I’m not sure what I was expecting, but the sea winds were pushing us around pretty good on the way over. Amund, the pilot, told me twice during the trip that we might have to abort and try again when the weather was calmer, but he kept us moving and eventually we arrived at my destination.

He’d been pretty talkative when we’d first met and even more so when we lifted off from the helipad at the port, but that seemed to fade the closer we got to Rook Island. He’d filled me in on a little of the history of the place to pass the time – how the current lighthouse was actually the *second* one to stand on that rocky outcropping. According to him, the first had been built sometime in the early seventeen hundreds and had been completely wiped out by a nasty winter storm in 1803, taking all three men stationed there with it. Another, more modern design had been erected after that, which was the foundation of the current Rook Island Lighthouse. He’d also made some brief mentions of how even that original lighthouse had been built upon the foundations of some old, secluded abbey, but the weather started getting rougher by then, and he was focused more on flying the helicopter than chatting.

I wasn’t too sure about what he was telling me, honestly. Sure, I could buy that there had been another lighthouse before this one, but an *abbey*? Out here?

Nah – I call bullshit.

I was pretty sure he was jerking my chain. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to probe any further after that, because the lighthouse appeared before us at that point, a little dot of white emerging from the haze of rain and mist in the otherwise endless ocean below.

How the hell do they even build lighthouses way out here in the middle of nowhere?

The winds had been pushing us around even more forcefully as we approached, but Amund was able to land us on the small helipad that had been retrofitted to the lighthouse roof with only a bit of struggle. He tried to maintain his ever-present calm demeanor, but I didn’t miss the beads of sweat and the occasional grimaces of concentration as we settled on the pad.

Even after we’d touched down, he seemed on-edge. His eyes never stopped moving and he never took his hands from the controls. Just gave me a nod after we’d settled on the deck – my signal to get moving.

I hopped out, grabbed my bags, and climbed down through the trapdoor in the helipad, ducking under the rotor wash and careful of my footing on the rain-slick surface. As soon as I was safely below, he was up and gone again, the bright orange and yellow helicopter fading into the gray sky as it made its way back to land.

The lighthouse isn’t what I expected.

I was envisioning a quaint little island, maybe covered in green grass and with a cozy old cottage standing nearby. Typical post-card stuff.

Rook Island isn’t that sort of lighthouse.

It rises like some pale skeletal finger from the depths, jutting out from the angry sea atop a narrow pillar of rock. From the air, I could see the dark shadow of the submerged shoal surrounding it, an underwater island that couldn’t quite reach the surface. Beyond the jagged edges of the shoal, the water turned indigo and then black as it fell away to thousands of feet of murky depth.

The lighthouse was a slender tower built atop that rocky outcropping, battered and scarred from two hundred years of dutiful service and countless repairs.

Amund told me that, before they had built the helipad on the roof, lighthouse keepers arrived on boats at a small dock, the ruins of which were still visible at the base of the rocks. A narrow and precarious staircase, long since taken by the seas, had been the only means of entrance or escape from the island at that time. There were only small and infrequent windows of opportunity to safely approach the island by boat, and it wasn’t uncommon for the storms to make that approach impossible for weeks on end.

According to the pilot, more than one keeper had lost their lives to the churning waters here over the years. Bodies never found.

I guess when the sea takes a man, it’s not too keen on giving him back.

Things were different now, of course. The lighthouse had been automated back in the 90’s, and now the only people that came out here were the small crews that visited a few times a year to perform maintenance.

That’s us.

Well, technically, it’s only me right now. My partner, Calvin Sykes, missed his connecting flight yesterday and won’t be here until tomorrow.

So here I am, watching the helicopter disappear into the distance as I stand on the widows walk around the lamp room, with only the sounds of the wind and crashing of the waves against the rocks below me.

For all that noise, why does it seem so quiet?

My first job with this company. My first time in a lighthouse at all, and I’m all by myself in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight.

You know, I don’t think I’ve ever felt so alone.

 

September 2^(nd), 9:30AM

What a shitty night.

As it turns out, the weather only got worse when the sun went down yesterday. The gray clouds turned to black, and the rain came down so heavily that I could actually feel the vibrations from it in the wooden floor of the sleeping quarters.

The wind didn’t help. It battered against the windows and churned up the water below into violent whitecaps and huge swells crashing over the island. The howling was more than a little unnerving, but I kept telling myself it was just the way the gale moved around the rocks and the tower. I tried not to think of what it would have been like for those men who had been swept away by the seas all those years ago. I can’t imagine a more terrifying way to go out.

Needless to say, I didn’t get much sleep. For the first time in recent memory, my night was filled with disturbing dreams. I can’t remember them this morning, but I woke with an unsettled stomach and a constant feeling of anxiousness. I thought it best to avoid coffee and instead settled for a granola bar and some water. There’s a chair and a small desk up in the lamp room, so I’m sitting up here right now watching out over the water and listening to the quiet hum of the mechanism behind me as it slowly rotates the beacon.

The storm passed sometime in the night, but the sun is still blocked out by heavy cloud cover and the whitecaps of the ocean make me think it may get worse before it clears.

Calvin should be here this afternoon, so I’m sure I’ll be more at ease once he arrives and we start our work. According to company safety rules, there has to be at least two people present before I can do anything here, so I’m just trying to relax until he gets here.

By this time next week, I’ll be on a flight back home.

 

September 2^(nd), 12:30PM

Well, that’s just *great*.

Just got word over the radio that the weather back at the port has gotten worse. Low visibility, heavy wind and rain, and thunder and lightning. No flights today, and maybe not tomorrow either.

I talked to Calvin a little over the radio. He sounded a little frustrated and told me that there’d been a screw-up – some sort of miscommunication. Apparently, I wasn’t supposed to be out here by myself. Company safety policy was pretty clear on that part – I should have waited for him. He assured me it wasn’t my fault and I wasn’t in any sort of trouble – someone else should have known better.

In the end, there wasn’t anything to do about it now, and he told me to just sit tight and enjoy the scenery. He made a point of reinforcing the safety rules that that I should keep to the upper levels until he arrives; that it isn’t safe for one person to go sightseeing in the lower levels all alone. There was too much risk of injury in this old tower. That’s fine with me, I told him. The view up in the lamp room is pretty good.

I’m not happy about it, but I’m still getting paid whether I’m changing bulbs, repainting railings, cleaning bird shit off the stairs, or sitting on my butt. So, at least that’s something.

I brought a book and have some movies on my tablet, so I’m sure I can keep myself entertained.

Hopefully, the weather will break, and Calvin will be here tomorrow.

 

September 2^(nd), 6:42PM

I did some exploring of the lighthouse today, despite Calvin’s warnings. I figure he was just making sure he was covering the company’s ass if I slip and break an ankle, but what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him, and truth be told, I’m getting bored.

Most of the upper floors are cramped and crowded with equipment. The battery room is barely large enough for a man to squeeze between the banks of cells, and the kitchen/sitting room feels claustrophobic. There’s an old TV and DVD player hanging above the refrigerator, but it looks like it hasn’t been used in twenty years. It’s not like I brought any DVDs with me anyway.

The sleeping quarters are below that, with six compact bunks built against the cylindrical walls of the lighthouse. They have a curve to them, but they’re just large enough that you can sleep in them comfortably. Since I’m the only one here, I don’t have to fight anyone to get a bottom bunk, which is nice.

The lower floors are larger, since the conical shape of the tower expands outward down towards its base, but even there, the generators and electrical equipment take up most of the free space. There’s just not a whole lot of room to spread out in here. Even the bathroom on the floor below the bunk room is tiny, just a toilet and a narrow shower stall and some storage cabinets.

On the ground floor, just below the generator room, there’s an old, rust-speckled iron door leading outside the lighthouse. This must be where the old keepers used to come through. It’s barred and locked from the inside, but I was able to get it open and step out onto the narrow steel landing at the head of the now-missing staircase.

Twisted railings and two heavily corroded steps are all that remain of the stairs, and when I worked up the nerve to creep closer to the edge, I found myself staring down a hundred feet of jagged and slick rocks to the pounding black seas below. I couldn’t imagine having to brave the steps that had once been there, especially with the gusting wind that was trying its damnedest to peel me off the platform. Even with a firm grip on the doorframe, I didn’t feel comfortable staying out there long, and quickly went back inside, replacing the bars and locking the door when I went.

A spiral staircase descended even lower than this floor, and I figured it probably led to either a cistern or more fuel storage. I decided to save that for later; my clothes were soaked through now, thanks to the rain and the sea spray, and I was shivering from my brief excursion outside. I decided to head back upstairs, change into some warm clothes, and heat myself up some freeze-dried dinner. Maybe watch a movie on my tablet, sip a glass of the whiskey I’d smuggled along.

I’ll record more later.

 

September 3^(rd), 8:25AM

Okay, so apparently, I was more tired than I thought yesterday. After I ate dinner (which was surprisingly good for freeze-dried beef stroganoff), I went to my bunk with my tablet and, well, honestly, don’t remember anything after that.

The next thing I do remember was waking up in the middle of the night to another storm that had blown in – big surprise there. It’s funny, but even after only a couple days here, I’m starting to get used to the creaking and groaning sounds the lighthouse makes in bad weather.

At some level, it almost seems familiar and comforting. My tablet had slipped off my chest and found its way to the floor at some point, so I sat up and placed it on the nearby table. I was getting ready to lay back down and get back to sleep when an out-of-place sound wound its way up from somewhere downstairs. It was a low groaning sound, almost a vibration, with a higher pitched squeal riding just below the surface.

It sounded a lot like rusty hinges, and I wondered if I’d neglected to secure the external door when I came back in earlier in the day. Begrudgingly, I slipped on my shoes and grabbed my flashlight and went downstairs. I didn’t want to turn on the lights, for fear of chasing away any chance I might have to go back to sleep afterwards.

I knew if the door had blown open, the storm would find its way in and soak everything. For my first job with the company, I sure as hell didn’t want to be responsible for flooding the lower levels, so I figured I needed to check it out and make sure everything was good.

I’m not gonna lie; going down those curving metal stairs with only my flashlight to guide me, in the middle of a storm and surrounded by an angry sea, was more than a little unnerving. I thought briefly about how the first lighthouse had been completely destroyed by a winter storm, but pushed that thought from my head and focused on my footing.

Now, I’m not a skittish person by nature. I’ve done plenty of jobs that found me all alone in remote places, and I’ve never once worried about anything other than whether or not I was able to get the job done on schedule or what I was going to eat for dinner.

I pride myself on being rational. I’m not afraid of things that go bump in the night. After all, there’s nothing there in the dark that isn’t there in the light, but even so, I could feel that growing sense of anxiousness trying to find root in the back of my mind. It was like an unfamiliar whisper telling me to go back up and get back into my bunk.

*Nothing to see here. Move along.*

So down I went, stubborn as ever.

Even before I reached the door, I knew it couldn’t have been open. The creaking sound didn’t reoccur, and the howl of the wind was still thankfully a muted roar, insulated by the thick walls of the lighthouse. Still, I’d come this far, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep unless I put eyes on it and checked for myself.

Sure enough, the door was still barred and locked, vibrating and occasionally rattling against its frame from the fury of the wind outside. Giving it a final once-over to reassure myself that all was well, I turned to head back upstairs.

No idea what that sound was, but regardless, at least it wasn’t anything I did. I’m not supposed to be down there by myself and I’m not looking to get fired on my first outing with this company for flooding the lighthouse.

That was last night. This morning, I’ve already had my first coffee and some toast and I’m sitting at the table in the lamp room right now, looking out over the ocean. The storm has lessened in the hours since last night, but it’s still raining and blowing outside and the clouds are still low and gray.

I’m no meteorologist, but I’m fairly confident I won’t be meeting my partner today, either.

I’m starting to wonder if this job was a good idea. I feel like I’m a million miles away from home.

Anyway, I’m going to finish another cup of coffee and head on downstairs to poke around a bit more. It’ll do me some good to have something to do.

More to come…

 

It’s… um… 9:45AM – same day

*I don’t understand. I…I just...*

*This can’t be real…*

*I mean… I must be losing my mind – that’s the only explanation, right?*

*Shit.*

*I can’t do this right now.*

 

September 3^(rd), 11:00AM

Okay. I’ve had a couple glasses of whiskey, and I’ve calmed down a bit – enough to do this recording of what happened, anyway. My thoughts are fragmented, but I’ll try my best to make sense for anyone who’s listening to these recordings.

I’ll try to just start from the beginning and take it one step at a time.

After I finished my coffee, I went downstairs like I said, turning my attention to the concrete steps that descended further down from the ground level and continuing my exploration from yesterday.

As I suspected, the floor below – what you’d call the basement level, I guess - was occupied by a large fuel tank, but what I didn’t expect was to find another door and more steps leading even farther downward.

This was different than I’d seen before, though. It wasn’t painted wood or even a solid metal door like the exterior entrance had been, but instead was a wrought iron gate, ornately fashioned and looking more like it belonged in a castle dungeon or something. The center of it was embellished with a large iron crucifix, covering half the gate. I can’t say why, but for some reason, I found it strangely… I don’t know – foreboding is the word, I guess.

The gate had actually been half-hidden by some old cargo netting hanging on the wall of the basement level and I hadn’t noticed it at first. I pulled the netting away and took a closer look.

Through the iron bars, the beam of my flashlight illuminated rough steps, carved into the gray rock of the island itself. They spiraled downward and out of sight, so I couldn’t see very far, but my light reflected from the moisture-slick walls and surfaces of the steps. Standing in front of the door, I could smell the cool, musty air that wafted up from somewhere below. It smelled old and stale, like a museum or a stuffy library basement. It was the odor of things hidden away and forgotten.

I wondered exactly what reason anyone might have had to dig deeper in the heart of the island, and how far down the stairwell might actually go.

There was no key in the lock, but when I tugged on the door, it swung outward with a little resistance, and my stomach lurched at the all-too-familiar groaning and screeching that rose from its rusted hinges. There was no mistaking that sound; it was the same as I’d heard last night. I told myself that it had been just the door swinging lightly back and forth, pushed around by the pressure changes caused by the storm.

It sounded good at the time.

With more apprehension than I’m comfortable admitting, I forced myself to investigate further, carefully making my way down this new stairwell. The steps were slick with moisture and a greenish-black mold that covered most of their surface. They were uneven and steep, clearly carved by an inexpert hand and looking much older than the rest of the lighthouse. The centers of them were worn and smoothed as if by hundreds of years and countless footsteps.

As I went, the air grew colder and more humid, and after a bit, I had descended far enough that I was sure I must have been below sea level. The walls were hewn with the same rough construction as the steps, and the arched ceiling was barely tall enough to allow me to pass without stooping.

Although I didn’t keep track, it was at least ten or fifteen minutes that I went down in that spiral tunnel, growing more uncomfortable with each step. This stairwell was so out of place with the more modern construction above that I was sure it must have predated the lighthouse by some time.

Maybe it was a part of the original lighthouse, I’d thought. Hell, maybe even from that unlikely abbey that the pilot had mentioned.

When the stairwell finally reached the bottom, I felt like I had gone a hundred feet or more below the surface of the rocky island, and the thought of being surrounded by all that black ocean made me more than a little uncomfortable. Down there, I could feel the vibrations of the seas as they battered against the stones outside, could hear the muted thunder of their crashing in deep echoes.

The room I found myself in was larger than I might have expected – probably fifty feet across. In the center of that stone room was a small wooden table and chair, both made from heavy dark wood and obviously old.

An antique oil lamp sat atop the damp surface of the table, its glass shield soot-stained around the top and encrusted with the long-dried remains of its fuel. In the center of the table, a thick, leather-bound book lay open, though the years and moisture had turned the pages to little more than a mass of blackened decay, making it impossible to identify what it might have been.

A bible, maybe? I’m not sure.

I swung the flashlight in the area around the table and found it otherwise empty of furniture, but not of decoration. The walls were smoother than those of the stairwell I’d come through, and though heavily stained with streaks and blotches of mildew and mold, I could see the time-faded remains of pastel murals covering them.

I can’t say why, but an uneasy feeling had settled over me, almost as if I’d found a place I wasn’t supposed to. Like I was trespassing somewhere I wasn’t welcome. Pushing it aside, I wandered a little closer to the walls, examining more closely the artwork and trying to discern what it depicted. The scenes were so corrupted by the wet environment that I couldn’t make out any details, but the whole thing had the feel of those elaborate frescos I’d seen in old churches.

Turning away from the paintings, I swept my light over the whole of the room again, the bright beam cutting a narrow tunnel through the gloom, tiny motes and moisture sparkling in the light. My breath hitched and my heart jumped to my throat when it suddenly found the two motionless forms kneeling upon the floor and facing a section of the wall.

I let out a spontaneous curse at the sight, shocked to find I wasn’t alone in this dark place. Instinctively, I leapt back, keeping the flashlight trained on the huddled forms. I stood rooted to that spot a long while, the beam from my light shaking in my hand and my feet ready to take flight at any second. When some time had passed without anything happening, I finally worked up the courage to move a little closer.

What I saw only added to my confusion. What knelt before me were the skeletal remains of two nuns, their old-fashioned habits hanging loosely upon their still-erect frames. Their fleshless skulls were slightly downturned, as if they’d died in prayer, and the bleached bones of their hands still clutched what appeared to be rosaries and crucifixes. The fabric and design of their vestments, though plain and coarse, marked them as catholic nuns, or of some related sect. At least, that was my guess.

It was obvious they’d been here for a long time – maybe centuries, dying where they knelt in eternal watch. I couldn’t understand why they hadn’t crumbled to piles of bone and cloth in all that time, and my mind continued to rebel against my presence here. Every ounce of my body felt that pull – the insistence that I leave this place immediately and never return.

Still, I focused on my breathing and forced my thoughts to calm, turning the whole thing over with logical set.

Yes, there were bodies. But they were *old*. It wasn’t like I’d just tripped across a murder scene. If this place had once been a hermitage convent or abbey, it only made sense that there might be some remnants of their existence. I told myself that this was a holy place, a place where the pious sequestered themselves from the rest of humanity to focus their devotions without worldly distraction. If anything, this was a historical place that should be studied by scholars, not a place of irrational fear.

I told myself all this, and it helped a little. Enough for my curiosity to take the lead once again and my racing heart to ease a bit.

Reluctantly turning my light from the two sisters, I focused it on the section of wall before them, where their attentions had been focused in their vigil.

It was there I spied the door. It was cleverly concealed under the decorations of the mural, but the thick wood had swollen and warped with the moisture and now stood a little proud of the wall. It looked like there had once been a handle of some sort to pull it open, but now there was only a hole where it had once been mounted.

I pulled at it tentatively before I realized that there were heavy black iron nails running around the border of the rotting wood and into the frame. I can’t say why, but I felt compelled to investigate further. This had obviously been the subject of the nuns’ attentions and had been important enough for them to remain in prayer until their dying breaths. I couldn’t imagine what might lay beyond that door.

I grabbed the multitool from my back pocket and flipped open the pliers, going to work pulling the nails out one at a time and letting them drop with dull rings to the floor. When I was done, I stepped back a moment and looked over the surface, making sure I hadn’t missed any.

I hesitated a beat, something almost instinctual – a primitive stirring at the back of my mind – telling me to leave it alone.

Ignoring that voice, I carefully hooked a finger through the hole in the door and pulled, abruptly jerking my hand away at the slimy, spongy feel of the wood. It felt uncomfortably warm and somehow, *sickly –* almost like I had touched something alive. I grimaced and scrubbed my hand against my jeans in revulsion.

The door swung open slowly with a scraping protest until there was enough room for me to step inside. When I did, a soft current of fetid air blew past me, smelling of stagnation and age and something else that I couldn’t place.

Something *wrong*.

This is where I begin to wonder if I’ve lost my grip on sanity. The interior of this room was undecorated, the walls the same slimy gray as the stairwell had been. But it was what my flashlight revealed within that demanded my immediate attention.

There, chained to the far wall with thick iron shackles, stood the desiccated and unmistakable remains of a man. He had been huge – every bit of seven feet tall, and grotesquely deformed. Even though the flesh had long since shrunk and withered, taking on a gray hue mottled with angry red splotches, I could see clearly the unnatural protrusions covering the whole of his remains, pushing out from beneath the leathery skin as if they were trying to escape. The skeleton beneath was twisted and malformed.

Across the wall behind the figure, it looked like someone had painted huge, outstretched wings in a powdery black medium – charcoal or something like that. It almost looked burned into the surface of the stone wall, like someone had painted it with gunpowder and then ignited it. Those wings must have been twelve feet across and depicted in a fashion that made me think of something reptilian or maybe bat-like, with membranes of skin instead of feathers. It gave the whole scene an even more sinister and unsettling air.

I’m not sure how, but the corpse still stood upright as it had in life, with arms outstretched and bound by the heavy iron restraints. Its head, abnormally large and bulbous, hung upon its chest limply, its features downcast and hidden from view. How long had this man suffered here before his death?

What terrible thing had he done to deserve this?

What was this place?

Before I had time to contemplate this any further, something happened that I still can’t explain and is the reason my hands are still shaking right now.

It moved.

The fucking thing actually *moved*. With the rustling and creaking sound of dried leather stretched taut, the head lifted slowly from its chest, and black pits that once held eyes fixed on me. A wave of nausea swept over me like a cold wash, and I started hyperventilating. Intense flashes of sickening revulsion and raw fear spiked painfully in my mind for a blinding moment, like nothing I have ever felt before. I put my hands to my head, as if that would help ward off this onslaught of pain, but it didn’t shield me at all.

Stumbling backwards blindly, I tripped and fell hard in the doorway, cutting my hand painfully on the discarded iron nails and scattering them across the floor. I was only there for a second, though, because the next thing I knew, I had scrambled to my feet and was running back up the winding staircase as fast as I could, hands against the disgusting slickness of the mold and algae to steady my flight. All I could hear was the thudding of my heartbeat in my temples and the rasping of my breath.

When I reached the iron gate, I rushed through and slammed it hard behind me, turning then and peering through the bars into the swirling darkness below. I strained hard to see or hear anything, and after a few moments, the sound of slow and wet breathing drifted up from that stygian abyss.

I thought I heard – though I can’t swear to it – the faint metallic sound of heavy chains striking the stoney floor somewhere in the shadowed depths, and that nausea returned, almost physically pushing me away from the door and chasing me back up through the levels of the lighthouse above.

I didn’t stop until I found myself in the lamp room at the top of the lighthouse, dropping heavily into the chair and resting my head on the table, trying to catch my breath.

It took me longer than it should have to realize that the room was quiet, other than the muted sounds of the wind and the sea. The beacon was no longer rotating behind its lenses. The light was no longer lit, and it felt for all the world like something momentous had just changed.

What the hell is going on?

 

September 3^(rd), 6:45PM

They’re not coming, and they’re not answering my radio calls anymore. I know they’re still there, listening, but they won’t answer me. Won’t tell me why.

I’d been trying to raise someone – *anyone –* on the radio for hours with no answer. I’d just about given up trying when my radio crackled and the voice of Calvin Sykes, the man who was supposed to be my new partner, came through. His tone was flat, but I didn’t miss the hint of frustration in it. Maybe a little disappointment, too.

He said that the light had gone out, like that meant something special that I didn’t understand. He told me that I’d been warned to stay out of the lower levels. Didn’t *ask* me if I’d disobeyed his instructions – somehow, he just *knew*. Said that I was a part of it now. That there wasn’t anything they could do – they had no choice. Nothing could come off the island now. Something about the *forsaken* and *the nameless,* but he’d lost me by that point.

I have no earthly idea what he was rambling about, but I understood the gist of what he was telling me – they weren’t coming for me.

My first stay at a JDV property. $311 with all taxes and fees, 23k to book w/ points. Was not expecting full participation in WOH benefits but was given an upgrade and 2pm checkout without asking. I believe Andre checked me in and was incredibly friendly. Upgrade was to a deluxe or premium king, room was still NYC small. 

Had a full bathroom door that closed, but the toilet paper holder was broken. The room seemed fairly worn but nothing terrible. On the 7th floor facing 49th St, I heard noise but with a fan going nothing woke me up. TV behind the mirror is the dumbest thing I've ever seen, unwatchable. Location is great, go left to totally avoid Times Square, go right and you're right in it. 

Hyatt Grand Central: 


Was not expecting much here as the reviews in the app had this at 3.5. 23k points used, cash price was right below $600.  2pm checkout was offered without asking, not sure if I got an upgrade. Got a pretty large room with a courtyard ""view"", it was totally quiet during the stay.

Room was comfortable but fairly worn, again nothing terrible. TV was really far from the bed, no coffee maker in room. Bathroom had a full door, hated the shelf right behind the toilet as you will smack your head on it when sitting down. Location was great, direct connection into the station during the daytime. Better than reviews noted but if I spent $600 on that I would have been upset. Did not care for the security folks up front checking cards, they were not friendly in the least. Bad first impression, they should do better. 

I would stay at both properties again if the price was right, however they were overall unremarkable.",5,1758215195.0,hyatt,2,1.0,False

She got a taste of her own medicine.,"I used a reverse image search tool called faceseek to give the person who bullied me in middle school a taste of her own medicine. She recently tried to friend me on social media, claiming she was ""so sorry"" for how she treated me. After a decade of torment, I was not about to let her off the hook with a simple ""let's grab coffee."" I was enraged.

I took her professional headshot and ran it through the tool. I was looking for something that would humiliate her. The tool found an old, tagged photo from a college party she attended years ago. She was wearing a truly atrocious outfit, and she was clearly having a wild time. It was the type of photo you'd assume she'd want to delete from the internet forever.

I saved the photo, went to her profile, and in a group photo she was tagged in, I replied to her with a single, brutal comment: ""Hey Ashley, I found this old picture of you. Wow! You've really changed. We should definitely get coffee soon.""

I then blocked her so I couldn't see her reaction. I know she saw it because a mutual friend messaged me saying that Ashley was furious and had been complaining about me. I've heard she's been furiously trying to delete the photo from her social media ever since. It was a petty, cruel move, but it was so satisfying.

Oh man, just thinking about my first winter trip to South Africa still gives me that butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, like the world's handing you a gift wrapped in sunshine and surprises. It's coming up on June 2026 now, and if you're anything like me back then—staring at a map, dreaming of golden beaches and misty mountains—you're in for some pure joy. Winter down there isn't the bone-chilling kind; it's mild and cozy, with crisp mornings that warm up to perfect exploring days. I remember landing in Cape Town, the air smelling like salt and adventure, and realizing this was going to be one of those trips where every little moment sticks with you, like laughing with locals over a sunset braai or spotting a whale from the shore. If you're gearing up for your own spin on it, let's chat about how to make it happen without the stress, all while chasing those happy vibes that make travel feel like coming alive.

# Sorting Out the Basics Before You Jet Off

I was a bundle of excitement mixed with ""what ifs"" before heading out, but ticking off the prep list turned those nerves into straight-up giddiness. Start with your passport—make sure it's got at least six months left, and snag that eVisa online if you're from a visa-free spot; it took me about 10 minutes and a few bucks, done while sipping coffee. Vaccines? Get the routine ones like hep A and typhoid squared away, plus rabies if you're venturing into wilder areas—my doc gave me the rundown, and it was quick. Packing was my favorite part: layers for those cool evenings, like a fleece for Drakensberg chills that dip to the 40s, comfy hikers for trails, and a swimsuit because the east coast stays balmy. Toss in sunscreen, a reusable water bottle, and adapters for those wonky plugs. I even printed a little itinerary with backups, because who needs Wi-Fi drama? The night before takeoff, I danced around my living room to some Ladysmith Black Mambazo tunes, feeling like the luckiest soul heading to a place that's all heart and horizon.

# Keeping the Cash Flow Happy on the Road

Budgeting didn't feel like a chore on my trip; it was more like a game where every saved rand meant an extra milk tart or beach walk. I aimed for about $50-70 a day, stretching it by crashing in guesthouses or backpackers instead of fancy spots—those shared kitchens let me whip up simple suppers and chat with fellow travelers till late. Renting a car was a game-changer for freedom without breaking the bank; fuel's reasonable if you stick to highways, and it beat pricey tours. Eat like a local: markets for fresh fruits and vetkoek that cost pennies, skipping tourist traps for roadside stalls. Apps like Baz Bus for hop-on-hop-offs saved me on inter-city jaunts, and I timed it for off-peak winter crowds to snag deals on flights or stays. The best hack? That spontaneous picnic on the Garden Route with bread, cheese, and ocean views—it was cheaper than a cafe but tasted like victory. Watching my wallet stay plump let me splurge on little joys, like a whale-watching boat ride, without a single regret.

# Grabbing Your IDP for Those Road Trip Vibes

Nothing beats the thrill of cruising open roads with the windows down, and in South Africa, that means nailing the [International Driving License South Africa](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-license-south-africa) early so you don't miss a beat. I remember fumbling mine at first—turns out it's super straightforward if you plan ahead. If you're from the US, hit up AAA: snap a passport photo on your phone, scan your license front and back, fill their quick form, and fork over $20—it mails back in a week or so, or grab it same-day at a branch. Folks from other spots, check your local auto club; it's basically a translated version of your home license, good for a year, and you need two photos plus your ID. I tucked mine in with my passport, and it smoothed over a rental in Durban without a hitch—suddenly, the whole country's your playground, from coastal twists to mountain passes. That first drive, radio blasting amapiano, felt like the trip's official start, all freedom and wide-open smiles.

# Beach Bliss: Where the Ocean Meets the Soul

South Africa's winter beaches? They're like a warm hug from the sea, even when the breeze picks up—perfect for those lazy afternoons that turn into golden-hour magic. I headed east to KwaZulu-Natal first, where the water stays inviting around Durban's Golden Mile; picture pedaling a bike along the promenade, waves crashing, kids building sandcastles, and you dipping toes without a shiver. Further up, Sodwana Bay stole my heart with its coral reefs—snorkeling there in June was unreal, spotting turtles and fish in crystal water while the sun played peekaboo. On the west side, Camps Bay near Cape Town offered chic vibes with Table Mountain as backdrop; I lounged on the sand with a book, sipping rooibos, feeling like I'd stumbled into paradise. And don't sleep on the Wild Coast's Port St. Johns—rugged cliffs, hidden coves, and that raw, untamed energy where you can hike to a beach and have it all to yourself. Those moments, toes in the sand, salt on my skin, reminded me why beaches heal the soul, one wave at a time.

# Mountain Highs: Chasing Peaks and Fresh Air

Up in the mountains, winter wraps everything in a crisp, invigorating glow that makes you feel ten feet tall—my hikes there were pure euphoria, lungs full of pine and possibility. Table Mountain in Cape Town was my gateway drug; cable car up at dawn for that panoramic sweep over the city and sea, then a gentle stroll along the plateau, spotting dassies sunning themselves like little bosses. The Drakensberg had me hooked next—those jagged peaks dusted with rare snow, perfect for a cozy cabin stay and easy trails to Tugela Falls, where the mist kisses your face and you can't stop grinning at the vastness. Lion's Head nearby offered a heart-pumping scramble with 360 views that left me breathless in the best way, city lights twinkling below like stars. Even the Cederberg's Sneuberg peak wowed with its wildflower carpets in late winter—camping there under a blanket of Milky Way felt like the universe was throwing a party just for me. These heights aren't about conquering; they're about that quiet joy of being small in something huge and beautiful.

# Foodie Delights: Tastes That'll Make You Grin

Food in South Africa hits different—it's hearty, shared, and always ends with that satisfied sigh, like the country's saying ""welcome home"" through every bite. I still crave bobotie, that spiced minced meat bake topped with egg custard, scooped up at a Cape Malay spot in Bo-Kaap; the cinnamon warmth chased away any chill, paired with a storytelling auntie who made it family. Bunny chow in Durban was a street-side revelation—curry-stuffed bread bowl, messy and magnificent, eaten on a bench with locals trading laughs. Then there's boerewors, the coiled sausage grilled over coals at a braai; flames crackling, beers clinking, everyone piling plates high under the stars—pure communal bliss. For sweets, malva pudding's sticky toffee sponge had me moaning in delight after a mountain day, gooey and comforting. And biltong? That spiced dried meat snack kept me fueled on drives, chewy bursts of flavor that tasted like adventure. Every meal turned strangers into friends, turning ordinary evenings into memories laced with spice and stories.

Those winter days in South Africa weren't just a trip; they were a recharge for the spirit, full of sunsets that painted the sky pink, laughs echoing off cliffs, and that deep contentment of wandering a land that feels alive. If you're packing your bags for 2026, chase the joy—it's waiting in every curve of the road, every shared smile. Go make your own happy moments; you won't want to come back the same.

I, for the longest time, I didn't think I have ADHD — I have always grown up to be extremely extroverted to the point people say I'm and extra extrovert bc of how talkative I am. I have always struggle in school but not to the point of failing but barely passing but I always thought it was bc the subject was too hard and I never had good study skills. 

During my undergrad years I was a full time student, worked 2-3 jobs per semester while on the officer board for two clubs and the student senate and still working on hobbies like cosplaying and going out often. I always describe myself as liking to be busy bc I just don't like not feeling busy. 

I have had two therapist who think I have ADHD and one of them administered an evaluation exam and it says i'm moderate to severe for ADHD. My other gave me a referral and I kinda just ignored it and it expired. My GP, when I brought this up said it might just be anxiety — but I have friends with severe anxiety and I don't describe how I feel to be anxiety? 

 Lately, I've missed a lot of important work meetings and have had complaints on how I often miss small details on certain things at work that had cost a hassle to fixed and involving a lot of different departments. I find administrative work boring. I however feel like I don't have the ""normal"" signs of ADHD. I grew up with immigrant parents who were barely around and the oldest so I was in charge of raising my sister. 

I have an official psychiatry appoint in another month and a half. I don't know how to feel since the psychiatrist is older and white which I feel like puts me at a disadvantage since alot of white doctors/counselors I have worked with or seen are typically dismissive outside factors that impacts people. 

I have done things like forget to lock my front door, forget to shower- forget i have already showered and shower again, forget to brush my teeth, can't follow a routine for too long, always messy/clutter, caffeine like mocha or coffee makes me extremely sleepy, i use to drink tea @ 7:00 am to relax myself a lot more, i can't sleep often/have insomnia at time bc my brain feels like its aggressively on, i can be impulsive/spontaneous and will randomly plan and intricate activities, sometimes it feels like i'm chasing for a rush/high of sorts. had a bad problem chasing for a toxic relationships/ situationships bc they make me feel alive , but I just thought these were my teehee quirks. 

if you have made it this far thank you !!!! i know its super long and i, personally, wouldn't be able to read this much at times either. i just want to vent bc i just feel this looming doom of having to wait so long just to have a dismissive doctor.

1nkdu1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1nkdu1m/should_you_switch_to_amazon_aware_bamboo_facial/,Should You Switch to Amazon Aware Bamboo Facial Tissue Cube Boxes,"Testing out the Amazon Aware Bamboo Facial Tissue Cube Boxes was an unexpectedly delightful experience for something as mundane as tissues. As soon as I cracked open the neatly packaged box, I could tell these weren’t just ordinary tissues. The Amazon Aware branding immediately caught my attention with its emphasis on sustainability and environmental stewardship, which is becoming more important in our household purchases.

**Sustainable Design and Packaging**  
I was genuinely impressed by how thoughtfully designed these tissues were. The packaging itself is recyclable, and the cube box shape feels practical—perfect for both my living room and bathroom countertops. It’s aesthetically neutral and doesn’t clash with any decor. Each box houses 60, 3-ply sheets made from 100% bamboo, and while I didn't initially notice any difference, after using them daily, I realized bamboo feels softer yet stronger than regular wood-based tissues. Knowing these tissues are FSC-certified gave me a sense of contributing to sustainable forestry with every box I opened.

**Softness and Comfort**  
Softness is key when it comes to tissues, and these didn’t disappoint. Being prone to allergies, I go through tissues like crazy during certain seasons. Regular ones either rip too easily, or worse, irritate my skin after prolonged use. These bamboo tissues, however, felt super gentle on my face despite consistent use. My niece, who often complains about rough tissue hurting her nose, even commented on how pleasant these were compared to others we’ve used in the past. Plus, the 3-ply construction meant they didn’t dissolve immediately under pressure.

**Strengths**  
- The tissues are made with 100% bamboo, ensuring eco-friendliness.  
- Soft enough for sensitive skin and gentle on the face after repeated use.  
- Their 3-ply build offers better durability and absorption without tearing easily.  
- Compact cube packaging makes them easy to place on desks, counters, or nightstands.  

[Check Amazon Aware Bamboo Facial Tissue Cube Boxes price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b0bmqjl88z/)

**Performance in Absorbency**  
Absorbency is where this product truly shines. I’ve spilled coffee more times than I care to admit (distracted mornings are to blame), and these tissues were a reliable cleanup companion. They soak up liquid effectively without shredding into clumps or leaving bits behind. Even during cold season, their high absorbency makes them perfect for those endless sneezing bouts. You grab one, and it holds up well, which means less waste compared to thinner tissues; fewer trips to the trash can are always a bonus.

**Negatives**  
- Sheets per box are limited to 60, which might feel inadequate for high-usage households.  
- Initially, the box design feels a bit plain compared to more decorative alternatives.  
- Bamboo tissue may not be as universally available as traditional brands in local stores.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
After trying out Amazon Aware Bamboo Facial Tissue, I did a brief comparison against some well-known competitors like Kleenex and Puffs. While those brands are synonymous with softness and premium features, none can compete with this product's sustainability element. Kleenex, for instance, can sometimes feel overly perfumed, which might irritate those sensitive to scents, whereas Amazon’s bamboo tissues are dye-free and free of artificial chemicals. Puffs Plus with lotion is softer but lacks the same environmentally conscious production—so you pick your battle depending on your priorities.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
From a financial perspective, this product is very appealing when you think of the dual value it offers: sustainability and functionality. I did the math, and while it may not always match bulk pricing for store-brand tissues, the added benefits of bamboo construction and environmentally friendly sourcing justify the cost. If saving the earth one box at a time appeals to your inner eco-warrior, these tissues might be worth every penny.

The Las Vegas Aces, fresh off a historic 16-game winning streak that would make a coffee addict blush, are facing a familiar foe: the Seattle Storm. After a humbling 86-83 upset loss in Game 2, the Aces are back at home, where they’ve been as dominant as a toddler with a thimble in a bakery. But the Storm, led by the indomitable Skylar Diggins, have proven they’re not just here to make the Aces trip over their own shoelaces. Let’s break this down with the precision of aWNBA analyst who’s also memorized the entire *Office* script.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Aces are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around **78%** to win outright (decimal odds of 1.28). That’s like saying the sun will rise tomorrow, but with more glitter. The spread is a tidy **-8.0** for Las Vegas, meaning they’re expected to win by a margin that wouldn’t embarrass a basketball god. The total is set at **158.5-159.5 points**, suggesting a high-octane affair—though the Storm’s Game 2 defensive performance (holding the Aces to 36.8% 3-point shooting) might make you question if they’ve secretly trained their players in *Halo* multiplayer.

---

### News.digest(): Injuries, Quotes, and A’ja Wilson’s Historic Night

The Aces’ star, **A’ja Wilson**, is the LeBron of the WNBA when healthy, but in Game 2, she went from “unstoppable force” to “0-for-2 in the fourth quarter” after scoring 21 points earlier. Coach Becky Hammon didn’t mince words: turnovers and a lack of “grit” doomed them. Meanwhile, Diggins (Storm) dished out 7 assists and looked like she was conducting an orchestra where every musician knew exactly when to pass the ball.

The Aces’ 3-point shooting woes are a plot hole in their otherwise flawless season. They went from 48.3% in Game 1 to 36.8% in Game 2—imagine if your dating profile went

So, the DM calls me and asked about my rehire status as if I wasn’t eligible? Which has confused me even further. I know Onecall exists and but if memory serves right that’s only for current employees. Can anyone help a girl out? Throw away account.

TL;DR- what’s a way I can contact about my hr status? Want to come back but unsure if I can. ",3,1758213831.0,CaribouCoffee,1,1.0,False

**Drowning**

**February 3rd, 1956**

The revolver rattled in my hand.

I debated between my temple and the roof of my mouth, tossing the possibilities back and forth in my head, which I believed would soon have a hole blown through it. All the thoughts would spill out across the old wooden floorboards and stain the oriental rug by the fireplace if I chose the roof of my mouth. Or maybe they would reach the kitchen if I chose my left temple, surely an easier clean off the linoleum floor for anyone unlucky enough to clean up the mess.

A wild storm raged beyond the walls of my timid sixteen-hundreds farmhouse. Snow melted to rain as the winds grew all the more barbaric, and the moon offered no light to behold the chaos. And exactly one month earlier, I’d lost my profession as a journalist, which I’d long considered to be my last outlet of fulfillment in life. Fired, actually. Fired from fulfillment.

I never fully grasped how dismal my circumstances had become until it was too late. My family left me in this town, moving on to better lives in brighter places; and the inner demons I’d picked up in the Second World War inhabited the empty spaces my loved ones had left behind. 

In another era, or even another town, I might have turned to someone for help, but you had to be *very* careful with who you told these things to. Without caution, the wind might sweep you away to the castle on the hill.

I’d wondered about that castle all my life. In fact, I was born the same year it was established, thirty-two years earlier. Neighborhood kids shared Folter Insane Asylum ghost stories on the playground, drunks swapped them in seaside bars, and mothers served them as warnings and threats with wooden spoons when their children misbehaved. Folter had known three consecutive homes for the insane within four centuries. Generations upon generations of foul stories washed down like mud from a burial hill, always festering in the present.

These tales of ghosts in the dark, glaring out of shattered windows, stories about corpses found rotting in the unkempt fields surrounding that great fort, devils in the tunnels beneath it, and of course, regular citizens who were never insane at all, winding up in there, and never getting out. 

Whether any of it was rumor or reality didn’t matter, we believed what we believed, and therefore it was the truth. Yet, even knowing this, I’d always wondered, was there any truth hiding in them?

Despite my long-prevailing curiosity, I *feared* that sanitarium. I thought it best to keep my journalism career far from Winslow Hill—ironic, given the geographical immediacy between itself and my modest home. And even in the desperation of that night, I had no intention of writing about it, the thought hadn’t crossed my mind since long before I was fired. Even then, it was only a passing thought.

No matter. Too late for all that now.

I could still feel that boulder on my chest. The weight of their watching eyes. The harmonious clattering of typewriter keys altogether silenced as my former employer wet his lips against his Folter Paper coffee mug. He liked it lukewarm and extra-sweet. He liked the heap of sugar huddled against the ceramic wall waiting ‘till all the rest was gone, like a dessert. 

‘*Once you nail the right amount of sugar, maybe then you’ll get on the front page*,’ he used to joke. Half-joking and all in earnest. Shit joke, but I’d chuckle anyway. Eight years ago, and eight years of five packets of sugar in his two-to-three mugs of coffee every workday, not to mention the bakery goods, formed a man wider than he was tall. But who was I to throw a stone? All the while, I’d been passing up coffee, tea, and more recently, even water, for the ever-soothing ambrosia called alcohol.

Dust settled through the sweet, stale air of his office, decorating his coffee with micro-hairs and little skin follicles like a film over tepid soup. He sipped. “Wade.” A few micro-hairs were gone.

Heavy under the fluorescent lights above, I mustered a simple, “M-hm.”

“You *do* realize what I’m saying?” His acrid coffee breath was almost a comfort with enough whiskey in my blood. A familiar stench. I liked familiarity, however unpleasant.

 “Yeah,” this time, I nodded. That would support my case, no doubt. Show that I still cared enough while my low-lidded eyes fretted between his mug and his little steel-gray lower teeth. ‘*Were they always that dark?*’

“What did I just say?”

“I’m laying off the drinking, O’Donnell… I promise.” I didn’t miss a beat, answering him. I even nodded again, this time with a cool, smooth blink. ‘*That’s good. Good, calm, confidence. Thank you, whiskey-*’

He sighed. A *sharp* sigh. Or was that a hiss? His stout fingers dug against his brow, hiding a glare I was thankful to remain ignorant of until he adjusted and spoke up again, “*Wade.*” Darkened eyes glared through searing disappointment. 

‘*Is that not what he said? What did he say? How long have I been sitting here? Fuck, how much did I drink?*’ I felt hot. A river of sweat formed down the furrow of my back. ‘*No, this is just a talk, that’s all. Just a warning, right.*’

He tapped his pen against the rim of his desk, “I hope you do quit drinking, for your sake. I’ve been extremely patient with you, Bythorne. I like you. You were an excellent journalist for years, one of the best. But… that journalist has been gone for months.” His thick lower lip suspended from his protruding underbite, a dash of spittle dotted the newspapers between us. 

‘*What’s he saying? Why is he doing this?*’ 

He threw the pen against the papers, shaking his head, “Wade, I’m *firing* you.”

The whiskey in my veins twisted against dizzying reality. Lights above brightened, hummed, and flickered, while the staring eyes of my coworkers reflected in O'Donnell's half-moon wireframe glasses. “Oh.”

“I can’t just keep you here out of pity, I gave you a week’s notice to clean up your act, but I’ve gotten nothing of substance from you for… Christ, half a year now? I’m only losing money with you here. This is a job, not a charity, and if you have nothing to offer, I have nothing to pay you. Maybe someday you’ll turn things around and prove yourself capable, but for now… You’re done here.” Among the reflected stares, one smirk ricocheted.

“It’s Jacob, isn’t it?”

‘*It’s Jacob, isn’t it*,’ 

‘*Where would I be if I hadn’t been drafted*,’

‘*If I had worked harder and stayed away from liquor, I would still have my job*,’ 

‘*If my life wasn’t such a train wreck, then I wouldn’t* have *to drink,*’

‘*What if I pulled the trigger? What if I died tonight?*’

After all, it was a gift—an off-kilter, tonally deaf post-war homecoming gift—and what does one do with a gift received, if not use it as they see fit? My brother’s charitable heart was in the right place, doubtless underestimating the grating association I had with guns since the war. A decade later, and the muscles in my face still ached, the smile failing to reach my eyes.

What would my brother have thought of this gift if he knew I would nearly shoot myself with it? What will my brother think when he learns what I *have* done?

Forgive me, dear brother.

‘*Forgive me-*’

‘*Do not blame* *~~yourself~~* *yourselves-*’

‘*I love y-*’

“Forget it. They’ll be fine without it.”

I took another swig of scotch, scratched my beard, and flipped both middle fingers at my Underwood No. 5 typewriter. Dad, Ma, Frank, and myself glared blankly over the room from a portrait in the kitchen—of a set of photos, taken to celebrate my brother’s going away to university. In them, gleeful pride among the three brightened the sharp contrast beside myself, failing to hide the fear shuddering inside like a pressure cooker. The day before, a letter in the mail informed me that I’d been drafted. 

A friend once asked if I thought it was strange that my parents decided to celebrate like this before my brother had even stepped foot on university grounds, while only a single photo was taken before I left for the war: me in my uniform, my father waiting in the car beside me, my mother behind the camera, and my brother, already departed for a brighter, safer future. I just laughed. I never liked photo albums anyway.

“Yeah. They’ll be fine,” I lifted the bottle of scotch to my lips and-

*Thunk.* 

*Scratch.*

*Thump.*

A shuffling against the front door… and a yelp.

\-I took another swig, ‘*Just the dog*.’

I pulled the unfinished letter from the typewriter, peering, dim through intoxication and the shadow my frame cast over it—the fire raged all the more furiously in the fireplace behind me as the storm’s wind shot down the chimney and wrestled with the flames—but peering failed to aleve confusion.

‘*Forgive me-*’

‘*Do not blame* *~~yourself~~* *yourselves-*’

‘*I love y-*’

‘*Drown-*’

‘*Burn-*’

‘*Very good work-*’

“What? I-I didn’t…”

*Thump*.

*Knock*.

*Scratch*.

“Why would I write that?” I plucked a split-end hair from my beard, “I didn’t write that… How much did I drink?” The bottle of scotch was nearly empty. I’d just bought it that morning. Above my desk, a grand oil painting of two great ships lost in a mid-Atlantic tempest. It had hung there all my life, it was my grandfather’s creation, yet that night, through the storm within and without, I witnessed the scene in a new, violently ominous light. Was the wind slipping out from the painting? Will a torrent of ocean waves cascade from the brass frame and strangle me in the sea of my living room?

I decided I’d had enough to drink.

I had enough of everything.

I exchanged the bottle of scotch for the revolver, traced my thumb across the smooth, polished metal, stared down the barrel, double-checked the bullets in the cylinder, and pressed it against my brow. ‘*No. Not there.*’ The barrel flitted between my mouth and my temple, back to my brow, down to my chest, tapped an artery on my neck, and rested on my temple again. I drew in a sharp breath as if preparing to dive into the painting before me and tensed my finger around the trigger, but against every ounce of my will, it would not pull back. I pushed out a sharp breath, growled, and slammed the gun on the desk. 

‘*Very good work-*’

Those three words blinded me, “I know I didn’t write that,” I whispered.

*Knock! Knock! Knock!*

“Help… Please…” a frail voice called from my doorstep.

Drunkenly cautious, I crossed the room to the front door and opened it to find a shaking, haggard young woman, glaring up from my feet. Beyond and bearing down, the lights of the Folter Psychiatric Institute seemed to glow brighter than ever.

**Chapter Two:**

**White Rabbit**

“Here,” I slung a blanket around her shoulders and sat her on a chair beside the fireplace, “this should help some,” all the while struggling to think and act as sober as possible, and for the first time, I was thankful for the tolerance I’d built up over the years. Still, drunk as I was, I don’t know if I helped steady her to the chair, or if she helped me.

“Thank you,” she whispered with a freshly busted upper lip, one of the only discernible features behind the heavy black curtain of her hair, festooned with rust-brown oak leaves and pine needles. Hunched over, gripping the blanket like a life raft, she stared at the fire as though she shared some secret with it that I wasn’t yet privy to.

    “Are you in danger, did someone hurt you?”
    
    She hesitated, “I don’t know.”
    
    “Okay… do you want me to call the police?”
    
    “*No!*” She shot a soul-piercing stare at me, “*Please…*”
    
    I nodded, “Alright…” The room tilted, spun, and repeated as I closed my eyes, the reality of my drunken state returned to me, “Is it alright if I sit, are you okay for now?”
    
    “Yes.”

“Thank you…” I dropped like a stone into the identical red-cushioned wingback chair beside her. The oppressive heat of the hearth made battling the vertigo no easier, but I was familiar enough with willing my equilibrium back into balance.

“I’m sorry I’m here so late,” she whispered, as if I’d been expecting her. 

“Uh-that’s alright, it’s…” What time was it? The mantelshelf clock shivered in my blurred vision, ‘*Twelve-ten? God, I drank too much… Or not enough.*’ The cool metallic ring of my revolver’s barrel chilled, hot on my temple. I wondered if the woman could see it, red skin, a perfect circle, liquor-blood begging for that icy touch again. 

Through settling vertigo, my dog sniffed the path of blood, mud, and rain she’d tracked in on her way to the red-cushioned chair, now soaking like a sponge. I’d hardly noticed him following her inside. ‘*What is happening? What am I doing? I should be dead right now,*’ and now, this lost stranger shivered before me, inadvertently saving my life. “You’re freezing, would you like tea or water? I’m sorry, I don’t have coffee…”

She shook her head. “I’m fine.”

“Alright…” I would’ve asked if she was sure, assured her it was no problem, but the way she stared at the fire, those eyes were certain. “What’s your name?”

“My name?” Her brow jumped, “Bunny.” 

“Bunny…” A fitting name, no doubt—soft, twitching face, oddly bulging black eyes. She might’ve resembled Audrey Hepburn under vastly different circumstances. “Wade Bythorne,” ‘*Folter Paper journalist*’ nearly followed under drunken habit. 

Her face answered with compulsory etiquette. For a half-second, the instinct to smile overruled her discomfort.

“You didn’t knock at first, did you? All I heard was some shuffling out there for some time, I thought maybe it was just my dog. How long were you out there?” The dog plopped down between myself and the fireplace with a bassy groan.

“I don’t… um… I-I reached your door, and I felt faint. I fell and everything went dark…” She spoke to the fire, gazing into it as if it had asked her the question. She tugged at her bottom lip as words eluded her. “Then I… I knocked as hard as I could…” Her voice was soft, weak, and quiet, gradually growing in strength with each word. Little, dubious, woven flowers speckled her dismally blue frock, pinched and pressed between her thumb and index finger. I felt the coarse-thread fabric grating against itself in the resistance between her fingers. Wide eyed, her dilating black-pit pupils centered on me with such focus that sent the room spinning again. “Thank you… *so much* for letting me in,” a tear gathered in her right eye, lit up like a spark in the firelight as it crept down to her trembling chin, “I don’t know what they’d do if they found me. No one’s ever escaped before…” Still, the Folter Psychiatric Institute’s lights glared through the midnight storm.

“Oh…” 

She pinched the ugly frock harder.

‘*What have I done?*’

Her head shook involuntarily, descending into her lap, caught only by her descending hands. A thick hair parting down the center of her skull revealed a pale, white scalp. Rounded shoulders hopped, drawing in sharp, sobbing breaths, and between those breaths, she fit, “You-*huh* think-*huh* I’m c-crazy-*huh*!”

I shifted in my seat, “No, um… no, I-I just didn’t realize… I’m sorry-”

Little white fingers slipped up between her black hair and pressed against her ears, “It’s just like Cora-*huhhh*!” Each panicking breath was like the sharp strike of an off-key violin. “…It’s just like Cora,” she shook her head, whispering into her black hair veil, “Cora… all-*huh* over again… and again, and again-*huh*… and again-*huh*! And now look what they’ll do to her! Now look what they’ll do! You’ll see! You’ll see what they do!”

“Cora,” I asked, “who’s Cora? If someone’s in danger, I can try to help.” I don’t know if I really meant it. I just needed to end the panic.

She shifted back against her seat. “Someone’s in danger.” She answered simply. With a deep breath, her shoulders rolled back, head raised, hair fell back away from her face, I could almost see the oxygen pulled into her lungs. She held out her hand before her, a spot of blood, vibrant before the fire, slipped from the base of her thumb, and landed in the fibers of the oriental rug at her feet. “It’s not like they want you to think,” She spoke with full clarity, even as another tear ran from her eye. “It’s not a hospital, it is *Hell*. And the superintendent, Doctor Kohler…” Another tear ran from her eye while a troubled laugh fell from her lips, “He’s a brilliant deceiver.” She flashed her eyes at me, and momently, I thought I detected a smile in them. “He disguises himself as a good man.” It almost sounded rehearsed, “You *cannot* believe him.”

‘*She’s been dreaming of this escape for a long time.*’

“Doctor Kohler?” Everyone in Folter knew the name, he was after all, the only direct descendant of the eponymous Folter Family. And as an elderly man without a wife or children, he was the final descendant. “He has a good reputation… I mean, compared to his ancestors.”

She scoffed, “How much have you heard? How often do you see him or hear of him in the news?”

“Not much,” I shrugged. ‘*Never.*’

“Exactly, he means to stay quiet. It’s no coincidence. There *are no* coincidences with Kohler. *None*.”

My brow furrowed and words spilled from my lips despite me, “Then how did you escape?”

She paused, her lips shot aside, lifting over a yellow smile. She laughed, “I escaped.” She lifted her eyes as if spotting a cobweb, then settled back on me, “The hospital is understaffed. In all its years, more patients are brought in, the scale tips… and in such a massive establishment, it’s getting easier to go about unnoticed… I had to get out. I *had* to. So when I saw the opportunity, I took it.” 

The girl paused as if I’d spoken. Then stared past me with peculiar intensity, as if someone had stepped in on our conversation. I glanced over my shoulder, underwhelmed by the kitchen, empty apart from a mess of half-washed dishes and empty liquor bottles.

I rubbed my brow as Boo left my side and cowered under my desk, not abnormal in this weather, and all the while, Bunny’s gaze never left the kitchen. “Are you alright?” The low hum of a fly in flight grated through the air.

Her eyes withdrew from the kitchen and landed in the fire. “You wouldn’t believe me,” she whispered from a deeper register in her chest.

“Try me.” I smiled kindly, but her eyes never left the flames to see it. 

Her lips quivered, peeling over bared teeth, “You don’t know what you’re saying.”

“I’m sorry?” 

Her body slipped back into the chair, “You’ll see,” she shook her head with an absurd smile, “Don’t worry,” was she trying to comfort me? She laughed, her shoulders melted, “If they find out what I said, I…” Another tear fell, yet this landed on a pinched smile, “They’re not afraid to silence us. No tongue is safe.” She shot her eyes at me with a whisper, “Not even yours.”

I peered at her, “What do you mean?” ‘*How many of those rumors are true?*’

Her nostrils flared, lips curled, “You don’t believe me. Fine. That’s fine, you don’t have to.” She settled her eyes on the flames again.

“No, no I do believe you. I’m only trying to understand.” 

I leaned forward and she leaned away as if guarding herself. Her stare left the flames and lingered at the windows by the door she’d come through. The asylum watched us from atop the hill.

I cleared my throat and conjured a journalist’s question as if I wasn’t freshly unemployed, “When were you first admitted?” though after asking, I realized she must’ve been distracted by a hideously overgrown fly flitting about the room. In her defense, the buzzing as it flew was especially loud, and the abomination was abnormally massive, in fact, it may not have even been a fly at all—paired with my drunken state and its aimless, rapid movements, the insect was utterly indistinct.

“Um,” she met my eyes again, “uh, thirteen years ago.” She traced the scrape along the base of her thumb and pressed her other thumb against it, swelling a ruby bead on her wrist.

“That’s a long time,” she nodded. “Why were you admitted?” The insect flew into the dining room, out of sight, and more or less out of mind. “If you don’t mind me asking.”

“I um… I tried to end my life…”

I cleared my throat, only then did I realize the revolver still laid on my desk for all to see. “Oh. Sorry, just one moment.” I stumbled out of the chair, slipped the revolver on my desk into a desk drawer, and locked it. There was no graceful way of doing this, but having drank as much as I had, even Boo seemed to sense the awkwardness, shuffling underfoot. Beside the abstract, unfinished suicide note, my pen and notepad glowed distinctly in the firelight, and again- 

‘*Very good work-*’

\-whispered at me from the unfinished letter. “All these years, and I still don’t know if I should be angry or thankful that they stopped me before I could end it,” Bunny thought aloud.

I grabbed the letter, crushed it between my hands, and tossed it into the fire. I knelt, peering. Maybe I’d find some solace watching the flames swallow the words I swear I hadn’t written, but it all curled inward and collapsed into black ash in seconds before I could see those words burn away. Besides, a drunk man peering into a fire isn’t a good combination, and that wasn’t exactly how I wanted to go, even in hopeless desperation.

“What was that?” Bunny asked with unexpected clarity.

“Nothing. I-um… I’m sorry to hear that,” a weak attempt at consoling her, a self-flagellating curse struck my tongue behind pressed lips as I gripped the mantle for balance. ‘*I’m not dying tonight. I’ll just fall asleep and wake up with a hangover… And I’ll have to live knowing this was real. Shit, I need another drink-*’ 

I glanced at the kitchen. There, just before the sink, something stared at me. Shadowy, though not as shadows cast silhouettes, nor as dark corners manifest dark imaginations, this darkness was felt before seen, and already disorienting before contemplation like an optical illusion. And the longer I stared back, the more distinctly I felt that it had been staring far longer than I could comprehend.

“Hello?” I uttered.

It smiled. A smile felt in the mind’s eye, confirmed in the freezing of my blood.

“I’m sorry. I should know better than to ask,” Bunny apologized. 

The figure vanished in a moment too brief to carry weight… but in that final glimpse, I swear I saw a physical form. Pallid-yellow skin rolled and stretched tight over bony limbs, pulsing, itching, screeching, echoing in its absence through ringing in my ears, the fly buzzing through the room again, and my pounding heart, there and gone so fast, was it ever there at all? But the image was too strong, the feeling too frigid to mistake. I dug my knuckles into my temples and dropped back into the chair.

“Are you alright?” 

A glimpse at the kitchen—empty. 

I shook my head, “Yes. I’m fine.” I lied and promised myself I’d never drink again—another lie. 

“Do you need me to get you anything? Water?” She asked.

I raised a brow at her, “No, no… Sorry, I can’t recall what we were talking about.”

“That’s alright. I was just saying, I’m much better now than I was back then.”

“Right,” is that what she was saying?

“No thanks to those doctors and nurses, though. Only because I know true despair now, and I know to be thankful for what freedom out here offers.”

“Trust me,” the fly hummed into the other room, “it’s not all that great out here.”

“That’s what I thought before I wound up in that prison.” She spoke without missing a beat. “It’s a matter of perspective, that’s all.” She spoke with undiluted confidence. The shift in her tone from earlier was so strong, I hated it.

“Right, of course,” I buried a scoff under the response. ‘*A matter of perspective. Cute.*’ The crackling and popping fireplace struck the ringing lodged in my ears. ‘*What the hell am I doing? Who is this woman? What is she doing here? I should be dead!*’ 

“I’m sorry I interrupted your night,” Bunny said. “Your house was the closest I could find. And it looked so inviting with the fireplace…” She shifted in her seat and stared at the fireplace again, “I haven’t seen fire in so long.”

“No, no, don’t be. I understand.” I always hated lying to appease someone. I always hated betraying myself, uttering anything glib, like words never bore truth to a soul, but what was I supposed to say? ‘*What am I supposed to do? House this escaped lunatic in my home? What if  she’s completely delusional? What if she’s dangerous?*’ Dammit. “‘Scuse me, I need to use the bathroom.”

Staff arrived within minutes. A mousy receptionist thanked me for my call, apologized for the disturbance, and Bunny was carried out, sobbing, kicking, and screaming. 

I dreamed that night,

\*Bunny escaped before the authorities arrived. She must have heard me talking to them. I found her corpse the next morning in the little field in my backyard, not far from an unused, rotting barn, lying face-down in a puddle of melting snow. Her bloated, pale flesh glistened with dew in the overcast morning light. ‘\*Poor girl.’ *I thought.*

*Somewhere unseen, the fly’s erratic flight grated ceaselessly. With it, clicking and chirping like that of a cricket.*

*She shifted on the grass. Her head tilted, the blood had settled on her left side in a sickly purple hue. Her lips separated, yellow liquid trickled down her cheek, and she whispered, “Very good work.”*

Between reality and the dream, I don’t know which I would’ve preferred.

“You lied!” She shouted, kicking a leg at me, as the authorities held her back. “Liar! You told me you’d help me! You have to do something! You can’t trust them!” I closed the door as the authorities locked her in the back of their stout, white car. Her shouting echoed through the night and awoke me in the morning with a feverish hangover.

‘*I didn’t lie, did I?*’ I couldn’t fight the impulse to look out the window and scan the field, looking for the corpse I’d seen in the dream. ‘*Maybe I do owe her. She saved me without knowing it…*’ Patches of puddles reflected the overcast sky, speckling the pale field with shriveling heaps of snow. A light fog hovered low over the evaporating snow. No Bunny, of course. ‘*What did she save me from? Ending my own misery? What thanks does she deserve?’* 

Without owing her anything, I was still living without a purpose. 

Selfishly, I *had* to owe her for my life. Whether that meant ending Doctor Kohler’s potential reign of terror or somehow leveraging this as a way to regain my position as a journalist at the Folter paper, or both, there was purpose in my life to be found again. And despite rationality, guilt had already taken root, and fear with it, ‘*What if she was telling the truth? If no tongue is safe, what are they doing to her now? And what might they do to me?*’

Whether the things she’d said were true or not, her fear was true, and her hope was real. And I delivered her back into a prison she called Hell.

**Chapter Three:**

**The Cure of Folly**

Downtown Folter, a weary congregation of what may confidently be deemed America’s most dismal citizens. The euphoric glamor of the nineteen-fifties heedlessly skimmed over the town, perhaps mistaking it for a shambolic tumor on the earth’s downcast face. Cluttered seaside shops, bars, and diners strangled in the low-tide air, heaped on them after hundreds of years of oceanic wind, apparent in every structure’s westward tilt. Centrally, a church-turned-library offered wisdom to those daring enough to seek it, though not before demanding visitors bear witness to the town founder, Thomas Folter, immortalized in oxidized bronze.

With billowing cape and forlorn gaze under a wide-brimmed hat, the infamous founder raises a hand, palm-upward, with each finger pointing at the most historic Folter structures—though most had come to ruin since the statue’s construction. West, thumb and little finger touching, they aimed at Winslow Hill—the abandoned Folter Manor and the asylum with it. Northeast, ring finger aimed at the Cliff House—which ironically collapsed off its cliff in a landslide and tumbled into the sea. East-aimed middle finger, the House of Three Tears—devoured in a fire the same year Cliff House had collapsed. And index finger aimed southeast, the only house both remaining and accessible, and never owned by the Folter family, the Flitting House—née Baxter House—wedged along the border of central Folter and the industrial district. The directions of his fingers aren’t exact in pointing at these locations, but it’s a fun fact locals like to tell visitors, on the rare occasion anyone visits.

Engraved on the plaque at his feet, ‘*Thomas Folter. Father of the town. Father of the true Folters. Protector of freedom, perseverance, and the corporeal.*’ I glowered at Thomas, proud atop his granite boulder while a stray dog passed by to piss on it. The Folters were a wicked people, but at the very least, the family, and the town they colonized, had lived up to their Germanic name, appropriately translating to ‘*torture*’. Allegedly, the name originates as the Folters were torturers in service to some Germanic king for generations, countless centuries back.

Three homes collapsed or abandoned and his family line nearly extinct, leaving Doctor Kohler alone with his father’s name and the sins of his mother’s lineage. Given the power to rewrite the plaque, I might inscribe, ‘*Thomas Folter. Ever-worthy of scoffs, dog piss, and bird stool.*’

Even so, the town bore his name, and that Son of Thomas knew no end.

Sealed in a glass box at the far end of an aisle of bookshelves, an impressively preserved black rabbit watched through thick jet marble eyes. 

Two days had passed, guilt had only metastasized, yet the allure of opportunity and the hope of being a savior to those wrongfully imprisoned in the asylum had swelled to a distracting proportion. *If* they were wrongfully imprisoned. The taxidermized rabbit glared suspect as I scanned the single shelf of town history books.

‘*Birds of Folter, Massachusetts*’

‘*Massachusetts Mysteries: Folter Architecture*’

‘*Folter Flora and Fauna*’

‘*Folter Governance: One Town Under Two Powers*’

“Four books in the town history section, none on the asylum.”

“Yes, I saw that,” I said. “Are there any checked out? Or any I could order?”

“No,” the heavyset librarian of about sixty years sidled between her desk and the dust-adorned pulpit, raised midway up the far wall of the library, where Thomas Folter supposedly once preached. 

“You’re telling me you only have four books on the town’s history? Just four?” 

“Yeah,” the woman groaned, painfully lowering herself shakily into the creaking wooden chair. An oil painting of the town loomed over her head from the pulpit. As if in defiance, the Folter Psychiatric Institute atop Winslow Hill, pierced the overcast firmament with countless towers.

“Alright.” I scuffed the olive-green rug beneath my shoes, “I’m sorry, but frankly, I’m having a hard time believing there are absolutely no books or documents or anything on any of the Folter asylums here. Or any on the Folter family, for that matter. *Folter Governance* seemed promising but the author barely addresses anything outside of the government.” 

She blinked. 

“I mean, two of the four books are ecological, they hardly count as town history at all…” I waited for a response that didn’t come, and I couldn’t help but laugh, how the librarian seemed blind to the ridiculous reality of it was beyond me.

 A phlegmy cough echoed across the stale air, hardly any warmer than the world beyond the walls of the aged structure.

“Would you mind at least double-checking the catalog? Is it possible someone took some books and never returned them?”

“Sir,” she chuckled, the little brass beads of her beige glasses clinked as she shook her head, “I’ve worked here for the better part of my life. I *know* that what you’re looking for is not here.”

I raised a brow, “Where would they be?”

“Not here.”

I cleared my throat, “Listen, I know this is an unconventional request, but I’m actually a journalist, I’m trying to research the asylum, and I just don’t know where to go or who to go to. I don’t know if you have anything locked up in another room, I know the asylum and the Folters have always been fairly secretive, but please if you have anything at all, I would really appreciate the help.” I leaned in, “I believe this article could be of greater importance than anything the Folter Paper’s ever published.” Stretching the truth was a necessary evil in such times, namely when trying to win back your journalism career.

“Oh…” Her white-hair brows lifted high over her glasses as she leaned close, “I think I remember you. Wade Blythe, right?”

“Bythorne.”

“*Bythorne*, that’s right. No, we don’t have anything locked up.” She smiled, “But I’m sure my husband would be *glad* to help you. You know, he used to work at the asylum.”

“I don’t have time for this,” his heavy boots stomped across the salt-stained docks, reeking of sulfuric low-tide. 

    “I’m not trying to sell you anything, it’ll only take a moment of your time, really.”

The fisherman halted, “Do I know you?” A forest-green knit cap hugged his graying charcoal hair, falling like a waterfall over dry, cracked skin, calloused after years of violent sea wind and unforgiving labor.

“Wade Bythorne. Forgive me, I know this is abrupt, but I have some questions that I think you might be able to answer.” A dour foghorn bellowed in the distant sea fog, seagulls mocked the pulleys and metal rings, clanging against masts in the wind, and the salt in the air coated my tongue.

The fisherman furrowed his brow, “Wait… I know you.”

“Sorry?”

“Bythorne… Bythorne, yeah,” he nodded. “You were here back in November, weren’t you? Yeah, that was you.” It was. The research process for ‘*Fishermen Lost at Sea—One Year Later,*’ was tedious, to say the least. Folter fishermen aren’t the warmest bunch in town.

“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re talking about, really I just need a short moment of your time and I’ll be out of-”

“Don’t lie,” he scoffed. “You interviewed Chuck and Bates last year. You wrote a paper on ‘em. Ring a bell now?”

I nodded, “Ah yes, that was me. Forgive me, I didn’t want to impose, I understand no one wants to be caught in their tracks by a *journalist*,” I chuckled, but his flat expression offered no conviviality. “... But in all seriousness, it would really be a great help if you could answer just a few questions.”

He paused. The intermittent slapping of waves against the concrete seawall filled the silence, “What about?”

“Your wife told me that you used to work at the Folter Psychiatric Institute.” He immediately turned with a laugh and raised a stocky middle finger. “Only a few questions, please!”

“Fuck off.”

I paused, debating how far to take this. “Sir, I think you may regret denying me this,” I shouted, prompting him to halt and scoff again.

He turned back and tilted his head, “You threatening me?”

    I straightened up as he approached me. “Not threatening you. Warning you. You may have *vital* information which could benefit the town and its people greatly. *Please*.”
    
    He shook his head, chuckling, “I don’t know what kind of answers you think you’re gonna find, but I really don’t have the time for this.” He turned again, and I followed like a loyal dog.
    
    “Can you tell me anything about your experience there at all?”
    
    “I worked there a dozen years ago, anything I tell you is old news.” He crossed a gangway onto a lobster boat.
    
    “What about Doctor Kohler? Can you tell me anything about him? How does he treat his patients? His staff?”
    
    “Great. Doctor Kohler’s great,” he answered stiffly. “Patients are crazy, but he treats them well.”

“Is it understaffed? How are patients’ living conditions?” I halted, shouting from the dock.

“They’re fine.”

“Do you know *anyone* else who might know something about the asylum?”

“No. Now leave me alone and don’t ever talk to me again. Take it as a threat or a warning, I don’t give a shit.”

He stomped into the lower deck and I was left with an empty notepad flapping in the wind. The boat engine thrummed to life and passed the tip of the jetty before long, where a tall, skeletal, iron-framed red-lamp lighthouse moaned with the gulls.

I’d managed to interview several townspeople (people I was certain wouldn’t know that I’d been fired from the Folter Paper), however, gathering any solid information was as easy as sifting wheat from chaff. The few I suspected knew too much about the asylum and its secrets wouldn’t utter a word, and those who knew nothing special blathered on about all the aggressively common wives’ tales that had long polluted the town.

*‘Well I heard most of the asylum’s actually empty, they only made it so big to scare people off. Who knows what they’re really hiding in there!’*

*‘Good luck finding anyone who’s ever left that place. Even Superintendent Kohler rarely leaves it*. *I’ve heard some real evil stuff goes on in there.*’

*‘Oh no, that's all just a bunch of lies, but I did hear Kohler chopped off his own finger to get out of fighting in the First World War. That, or his loony mother chopped it off before she died. And they were* close\*, glued at the hip. He’s missing a finger, did you know that?’\*

I returned home in weary defeat. I inattentively slipped a short stack of envelopes out of my mailbox and flipped through as I opened the front door. Boo greeted me, licking the sea salt off my shoes and wagging his tail as I noticed that one simple envelope had been sent from the Folter Psychiatric Institute.

I read the handwritten, blue ink note with a shaking hand and perspiration lathering my brow,

*‘Mr. Wade Bythorne,*

I’ve tried countless times to try and date women over my last 4 years of college and even before that but almost every time I’ve gotten ghosted, it’s gotten to the point where I’m not even sure I want a relationship and honestly, the more I think about it, I’m wondering if I’m the problem.

I have siblings and friends who are all in happy and healthy relationships, and I even though they haven’t said anything, I feel like my parents are wondering why it’s taking me so long. And on top of that, I’m worried that after college there won’t be as many opportunities to meet new people, so my dating pool will shrink and I’ll be in even more of a bind than I am right now.

Additionally, every time I’ve been talking to a girl for a while and things seem like they’re going ok, I’ll ask if they want to hang out or grab lunch/a coffee etc, and almost every single time I’ve gotten ghosted. It’s sort of dehumanizing and makes me feel like I’m invisible and unimportant, so my self confidence drops and it makes me more reluctant to pursue people I enjoy being around. This is only compounded by the fact that I don’t really enjoy going to bars like a lot of college students do, and I hadn’t had the motivation/time to join clubs until now in senior year.

Thinking about it now, I feel like all of this pressure and previous and repeated failure has made me more anxious, which in turn prevents me from perusing actual friendships with other women at my college and has instead caused me to lock in to “problem solving mode” where the problem is “I’m single” and the solution is to “get into a relationship”. I’m so worried about my future with someone I just forget how to act like a normal human being, which then likely leaks to me getting ghosted, and the cycle continues.

TL;DR I just feel stuck, there’s so much self-imposed pressure from the people around me that I just can’t seem to get out of my own way and be happy and care free and not think about how I’m single and it’s somehow a “bad thing”.",1,1758213669.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1nkdc1k,https://i.redd.it/5ejylparbypf1.jpeg,Brock Neeley is a Warhawk. How a Porterville ‘Leader’ Peddles Militarism and Fractures Local Left,"In the politically arid landscape of California’s Central Valley, the actions of local figures carry a weight disproportionate to their national profile. Brock Neeley, the self-styled political leader and chair of the Tulare County Stonewall Democrats, has long positioned himself as a bastion of progressive values in conservative Tulare County. But a recent social media post has peeled back the veneer, revealing a figure whose allegiances lie not with liberation, but with the machinery of empire, actively undermining the very opposition he claims to champion.  
Just a day ago, Neeley—a perennial presence at Porterville City Council meetings known more for his attendance than his efficacy—uncritically promoted an event hosted by Rep. Jim Costa: a “U.S. Military Service Academy Night.” The advertisement, touting “an opportunity for students and families to learn about our nation's prestigious institutions,” promises a path to a “world class education while proudly serving our nation.”  
The post, notably endorsed only by his husband, John Coffee, and one other, is a grotesque spectacle in its timing. It arrives as the United States government, in lockstep with Israel, completes a second year of a brutal military campaign in Gaza that the International Court of Justice has found plausibly constitutes genocide. It comes as the same U.S. military from which Neeley seeks to recruit young minds has systematically purged transgender individuals from its ranks, a stark betrayal of the LGBTQ+ community he purports to represent.  
Here, in stark relief, is the portrait of a fake Democrat: a gay man, insulated by his own privilege, eagerly preparing to funnel a new generation of Central Valley youth into the gears of a war machine. They are not offered a future of diplomacy or peace, but of becoming fodder for fake wars waged by fake leaders on behalf of fake billionaires and the politicians who serve them.  
This is not an anomaly in Neeley’s career; it is the culmination of it. A comprehensive analysis of his activism reveals a figure who has, perhaps unintentionally, become a primary agent in dismantling meaningful local opposition to the rising tide of fascism in Porterville.

  
**The Biography of a Divisive Figure**  
Neeley’s biography, as he tells it, is one of a lifelong activist. A Navy veteran, he and his husband, John Coffee, made history as the first male same-sex couple married in Tulare County. This personal bravery is undeniable. In 2013, he successfully lobbied for a Pride proclamation from the Porterville mayor, an act of profound visibility that triggered a vicious backlash, including the mayor's ousting and vitriolic public threats.  
From this moment, Neeley’s path was set. He co-founded the Tulare County Stonewall Democrats, becoming the most visible LGBTQ+ voice in local politics. He was appointed as an Electoral College elector in 2020, a symbolic capstone to his career.  
Yet, his methodology has proven to be his movement’s undoing. Neeley’s activism is almost exclusively performative, centered on personal testimony and symbolic victories within the rigid, often ignored, confines of city council public comment periods. For years, he has “shown up to every City Council meeting making no change or effect,” as the critique states. This ritualistic attendance has created a illusion of opposition without the substance of power.  


**The Great Porterville Split**  
Under Neeley’s leadership, the local opposition has fractured into two ineffective camps, a split for which he is the central figurehead.  
The first is **Neeley’s Faction**: The Stonewall Democrats, laser-focused on LGBTQ+ issues. While these issues are critically important, the club’s agenda, dictated by Neeley’s personal brand of activism, often appears myopic and self-referential—a constant “talking about their gay issues and themselves over and over.” This has alienated potential allies fighting intersecting battles against poverty, environmental injustice, and racial inequality, making the struggle seem like a singular issue rather than a collective front.  
The second is a **“Rag Tag Group”**: A loose collection of activists, progressives, and concerned citizens who have “never found any footing or purpose.” Without a unified leader or a coherent strategy beyond reacting to Neeley’s chosen battles, this group has floundered. They lack the organization of the Stonewall club but are disillusioned by its narrow focus. Neeley’s dominance of the activist space has stifled the emergence of any alternative, more broad-based leadership, ensuring the opposition remains divided and weak.  


**The Final Betrayal**  
The promotion of Costa’s military academy night is the logical endpoint of this failed leadership. It demonstrates a profound moral and political blindness. While Gaza burns and trans youth are told they are not worthy to serve, Neeley chooses to partner with the establishment, waving flags and promoting the very institutions perpetuating violence abroad and discrimination at home.  
He is not building opposition; he is co-opting it. He channels legitimate anger into safe, state-sanctioned outlets—whether it’s a futile three-minute speech before a hostile city council or a recruitment ad for the military-industrial complex. He plays the role of the “good Democrat,” following party lines even when they lead to the grave, thereby rendering any truly anti-war, anti-fascist movement in Porterville inert.  
The silence that greeted his post—the mere two likes—speaks volumes. The community is either asleep or, more likely, has seen this play before and wants no part of it. The old man who once carried a picket sign with his union family now carries water for the empire. In doing so, he hasn’t just failed to create change; he has become the reason why local opposition to tyranny in Porterville remains shattered and powerless.over and over and the other a rag tag group who never found any footing or purpose against the fascism they face in their town.",1,1758213635.0,PortervilleFraud,0,1.0,False

They were now just accepted into their dream university too. It's far away, and I hoped they got accepted into a closer one. All I felt was numbness. I took a cup of coffee, but I head to fight my head the whole time trying not to disappear. I think they noticed. One part of me hopes so, but I don't think I would explain how I feel to them.


My brother did the same. I'm not happy for him. He never expressed the will to move out, yet he did. I'm the one stuck at home. He doesn't even really know me. I am trans and closeted, and he's into the alt right. I was hoping for him to go away so I could come out to my mother.

I also didn't tell me my best friend my brother did because I feel ashamed of myself.

I have no community. I don't have anyone. Even the ones I call friends are just strangers I can talk with.

My family doesn't have a lot of money. Maybe I could move out, but right now I don't think I will soon. All I can see why is how messed up I am. I could have moved out. I could have spent my money more wisely. I could have been abroad a few times. But I didn't. I am lazy. But I don't think it's just that. Maybe someone should have believed in me. That I can move out. That I can go to India to see the temples (my life dream). And if I tried and failed, it would have just been part of life. But they never ever suggested me to try.

1nkd9o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanwellneslife/comments/1nkd9o7/latams_smart/,LATAM's Smart,"# Latin American Smart Snacks Are Quietly Taking Over the Health Food Scene

TIL: Latin America is creating some of the most innovative healthy snacks on the planet, and they're backed by solid science

So I just came across this fascinating info about how countries like Mexico and other LATAM regions are revolutionizing the snack game with ingredients most of us probably never thought about as ""superfoods.""

Here's what blew my mind:

Coffee as a snack ingredient? Apparently, green coffee beans (not roasted) are loaded with antioxidants and something called chlorogenic acid. They're putting this stuff in energy bars and nut mixes. The result? Sustained energy without the sugar crash. Pretty genius, honestly.

Panela > regular sugar, and it's not even close: This is basically unrefined sugar cane that's been turned into crystals. Unlike white sugar, it actually has minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium. Mexican producers are getting creative with different textures and flavors. Why didn't anyone tell me about this sooner?

Papaya that doesn't go bad in 2 days: Through some fancy low-temperature dehydration, they're preserving 95% of the fruit's original nutrients while making it shelf-stable. The vitamin C content is insane, plus you get digestive enzymes.

Passion fruit doing double duty: Not just for flavor anymore. High vitamin A, fiber, and compounds that are actually good for your heart. They're using it as natural coatings for nuts and in powdered form for instant drinks.

The business side is wild too:

* The healthy snacks market is worth $32+ billion and growing at 8.2% annually
* 73% of people will pay more for products with clear health benefits
* North American markets are seeing 15%+ growth in premium healthy snacks

What I find really cool: These aren't just ""healthy"" versions of junk food. They're using traditional agricultural methods that are naturally sustainable, supporting small farming communities, and some companies are even using blockchain to track products from farm to package.

Has anyone tried these kinds of snacks? I'm genuinely curious if they actually taste good or if it's all just health marketing. Also, are there any brands you'd recommend?

The whole thing makes me think we've been sleeping on Latin American food innovation. While everyone's talking about Silicon Valley disrupting everything, these folks are quietly revolutionizing what we eat with ingredients that have been around for centuries.

Was it petty or just setting boundaries?,"Hello Two Hot Takes fam! At the beginning I would like to apologise for any mistakes (english isn’t my first language) and for the length of my post - i’m afraid a lot of context was needed to explain the story properly.

Lately I (22M) had some doubts if my behavior was too petty or if I was finally being more assertive. Honestly I’m leaning more to the second option but you will judge for yourself.

For the context, me and my friends are into cosplay, conventions, photoshoots (mostly characters from games, anime and cartoons). I’m a cosplayer and an aspiring photographer.
This situation happened on the convention I attended last month but we have to go back a little bit further.

So, at the beginning of august my friend (22F, let’s call her Suzie) asked me if I would take some photos of her in cosplay during convention. 
I was a little hesitant, since she wanted to take those photos on the day of cosplay contest (she was performing with my boyfriend (22M) and one other friend (22F, Zoe - fake name).

Just so you know, those competitions are taken pretty seriously. People put a lot of time and money into those costumes, sometimes it takes months to make one. Also main prize at this event was around 550 us dollars (for the best costume and performance).
Sooo as you can imagine there is some stress on that day and a lot is happening: 1. rehearsal on the stage 2. jury round where mentioned jury checks details and rate costumes/props 3. performances on stage 

Another reason why i didn’t really wanted to take those photos was location of the convention. That place wasn’t really suitable for the character that Suzie was cosplaying nor the outside surroundings which honestly can make it difficult to get any good shoots.

To add to that, Suzie mentiond that she would like photos of whole trio that was performing (she, my boyfriend and Zoe). First thing - more people means more time and work, another thing, she was talking for all three of them, I could understand for Zoe, but my boyfriend… well i know him preeetty well and i knew that he wouldnt be up for a photoshoot in place that doesnt suit his character. Besides, week before convention me and bf had photoshoot in really cool location therefore he wouldn’t need another shoot in place that doesnt fit.

So as you can expect, I told Suzie about my doubts but she kinda insisted. What we agreed on was to take some portraits pictures of her in the best place we could think of.

That conversation was bugging me a little bit 
and I remembered situation from another convention that happened in february, so i decided to text her again and clear things out.

I’ll try to explain what happened in february as quickly as i can.
I asked my friends (Suzie and Zoe) if they want some pictures during that convention (noone was contesting in cosplay contest and i was really hyped up bc event was happening in a another town, close to the sea and i really wanted to take some photos on the beach).
They said no - and it was totally okay, i just wanted to make sure before the trip.
I had two other shoots planned on saturday (paid) and one free with my bf on sunday. 

It’s a good moment to mention that at the beginning I wasn’t charging anything for photos bc I was still learning and needed stuff for my portfolio anyway. 
Those two shoots on saturday was my firsts ever paid shoots and I still wasn’t charging anything my friends or bf. Usually I would take the photos and they would edit them for themselves which is honestly half or sometimes most of the work i have to put in.

Back to the story. Suzie asked me if I would take photos of her and Zoe on Saturday. I don’t remember specifically when she asked but it was definitely short notice. I agreed tho
We didn’t had specific hour planned so when i arrived on Saturday, I called Suzie to inform her when I have time for photos. Well, she wanted to take pictures in the evening when it would be darker but i politely said that my lamp isn’t strong enough (i had only one weak LED lamp) and that i’m won’t be able to take anything good when it will be dark. 
So - again, no specific hour.
I continued with my day, that is - I had one of those paid photoshoots and after the first one I got a text that the second client cancelled.

I had multiple complications that day and during it i was carrying camera with lamp and heavy bag bc I was supposed to have shoot with Suzie and Zoe.

And I didn’t. Why? Because they already took some pictures with someone else. And the fact that someone else did it wasn’t even a problem. I was annoyed because they could have told me earlier and I would leave my camera bag and lamp in car so I wouldn’t have to carry it half of the day.


Back to that og story 
As I wrote earlier I texted Suzie again.
Told her that I have mixed feelings bc of the situation that happend in february and i would reaaally have to know specific hour and place to schedule photoshoot - otherwise - i wont do it. I told her that now i have plenty of work with other projects thats i have to finish so i dont really want to take another one that i’m not thrilled about and to do it for free.
I also said that I understand it’s still a little bit early (it wss beginning of August) so she could tell me later, after she would know at what hours of the rehearsal and jury round.
She said that she understands and it’s totally okay.

Well… after that day Suzie didn’t said anything more. 
So, I assumed that we are not doing it. To be fair i could have asked but honestly I had a lot going on and forgot. I remembered night before and since I haven’t got any updates I decided to just leave most of my equipment at home.


*day of the convention and cosplay contest*

I was chilling in tea room when Suzie, Zoe and my bf joined me after their rehearsal and finishing their make-up. 

Suzie sat next to me and asked if we could take some quick photos. I stared at her for a moment and said that we didn’t schedule it after all. 
Then she asked if i don’t have some time to take them anyway.
Well. I had time, but I didn’t have equipment that i would normally take for a shoot.
And that’s what I told her. 
While holding a camera. (i was af the event as media) 
I could have took those photos but at that point i didn’t wanted to. I felt really disrespected because few weeks earlier I explained all my doubts and we agreed on choosing specific hour and place to make it happen.

I could see that Suzie was clearly upset, she got up and said that she will call someone else to take those photos. 

Forgot to mention, about payment- the idea was to take photos and sent them to her so she could edit them by herself. I propose that she could just buy me a coffee for taking them. 
With the other photographer that she eventually took photos with, the cost of one photo is around 6 usd.

The question is, was it fair to refuse? Or should I have just took those photos and probably be dissatisfied withe the results?

The gnawing sense that the game is fixed. That the odds are stacked against you from the start. You’re not wrong, and bad luck at the start doesn’t mean everything balances out overtime. 

We are living in a debt crisis.

You can't solve inequality, fix education, or rebuild infrastructure if the nation is bankrupt. For decades the U.S. has and still is printing its purchasing power into oblivion. Increasing the money supply aka debt, means inflation rises causing your dollars to buy less and less each month. This is even before factoring in foreign exchange rates that moves based on volatility, and if volatility is high momentum of money slows, or worse stagnates because planned ROI is too uncertain for investors to invest.

Furthermore, your dollar will afford even less if the government selects to impose and or raise additional artificial price gouging tariffs. Tariffs will make everything more expensive, because the end consumer is forced to pay until broke. All tariffs hide the real price signals, making the signals less visible leading to market volatility. Visible price signals are required for an economy to function properly, and to shake this up can delay corrections from being priced in for months and or fiscal quarters. Which is like purchasing a coffee on Monday at $5, and then for it to rise sharply to $8 overnight. Tariffs also builds on a false equilibrium of opportunity costs, instead of improving added value to the goods and services in the market.
