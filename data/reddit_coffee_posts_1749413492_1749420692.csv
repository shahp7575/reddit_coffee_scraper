We had this one bloke, maybe mid 50s, always in a pressed suit, always rushing, always rude. Every time he ordered, he would go, Flat white, same as last time. Don’t mess it up this time. And every time, we ask for clarification he’ll roll his eyes and ask us to figure it out. “It’s not hard. You made it right once"".
Safe to say we were all tired

One day, I had just had it. He stormed in barking the same order. Flat white, same as last time.

So I gave him exactly what he had last time or rather, what he ordered last. A decaf oat milk cappuccino with caramel drizzle, he had ordered it once by mistake and hated it.

Handed it to him with a chipper, here you go, exactly like last time.

He took one sip, paused, and just said, What the hell is this?

I smiled and said, Your exact order from last time, you said not to mess it up.

He threw a fiver on the counter and stormed out. Never used that line again and was never rude. Worth it.",2,1749420618.0,MaliciousCompliance,0,1.0,False

1l6oasi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenlessZoneZero/comments/1l6oasi/thoughts_on_the_new_story/,Thoughts on the new story?,"I finished up the 2.0 story a little bit earlier, and have had some time to discuss with a couple of my friends on the story and our thoughts on it.

I personally have found the story to be a letdown. To start, my main issue with the story was the bad pacing, and the abundance of tutorials that I felt were unneeded.

Issue 1 - the story started off strong, we meet with Yi Xuan, get in the blimp thing, it gets shot down and boom, we’re in the open world. From there however it felt like a downhill spiral for the majority of the story (for me at least). Once we got out of the Hollow area and into the city it felt like a never ending loop of fetch quests and mostly pointless dialogue, we got to tour the city with Ju fufu, which I personally have never liked that in any game, I’d rather explore and find all the important things myself. We eventually get to suibian temple and there’s a ton of dialogue that I honestly don’t even remember what was talked about, which I personally think speak to the importance of it. I will say in the latter part, when we finally got some important talk about Yi Jiang and stuff, I felt the story had picked the pace back up, and it had me engaged. Also quick add in, it felt like this update had a lesser amount of cinematic cutscenes than the prior updates, which I feel doesn’t make any sense considering it’s a new version update. 

Issue 2 - a much smaller issue, and a more understandable one. The abundance of tutorials, I feel that the tutorials for things like “here’s the new coffee shop stand” “here’s the new HDD and video store” “look it’s howl but instead you get a fortune telling” it just felt unnecessary to me, it would’ve been much clearer if they just had the camera pan over them and some arrows annotating which is which in a short Birds Eye view shot. 

I do feel the need to say, I’m not trying to doom post or farm hate within the community, I just felt this story was outside of the short ending sequence, largely a pointless yap fest. Of course this is just my opinion, and would love for people to share theirs in the comments, please keep everything respectful if possible. Love you all.",1,1749420483.0,ZenlessZoneZero,1,1.0,False

Getting ghosted, people having too many options and always looking for greener grass, people's intentions not matching their actions, and not to mention all of the bad/weird behavior plus the time and effort you spend trying to get a simple coffee date (that probably ends up canceling an hour before,) as a straight guy who is in excellent shape, I sometimes wonder if it'd just be easier to ""date"" another gym bro just for the company and positive energy lol

For example, I was at the gym last week, and this guy I used to talk to who I think might even compete -- he's jacked and sculpted, but haven't seen in a few months was there. He sees me and is like, ""Hey man, long time. You're looking great and huge!"" It just made me feel 1% better that someone would see me and share that kind of compliment, especially when they know the word and dedication that goes into it. Not like the dating world is offering up positive reinforcement like that.

1l6o97v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1l6o97v/its_spreading/,It's Spreading,"  I don’t know if this is the right place to post something like this. Honestly, I don’t even know if you’re real.

But if you are—if you're the two sisters from Canada that everyone keeps whispering about—then I think you should know it’s spreading.

Because it’s here now. In America. And we’re not ready.


  It started showing up in voice chat first. Game lobbies, mostly late at night. I play a lot of squad shooters—like the kind where you run comms with your whole team. We’re just kids, you know? Trash talk, callouts, stupid jokes, clutch plays.

But a few months ago, the mood shifted.

One kid said his buddy hadn’t talked in two weeks—still plays, still gets kills, but doesn’t say a word. Another said he caught someone standing in his hallway at 3:17 a.m., but when he flipped the light on, nobody was there and the door never opened.

Weird stuff. Glitches in real life.

Somebody mentioned there was a post—some long thread from Canada—about a coffee shop, two sisters, and the same kind of crap happening up there. I didn’t think much of it at first. But then one of my friends screamed in the middle of a match and logged off. He didn’t come back.

That’s when I started paying attention.


  I noticed something. I don’t know if it’s a rule or just… a pattern.

If someone sits with you while you sleep—really sits with you—you don’t dream.
Not near you. Not in the next room. I mean right there. Awake. Breathing. Watching.
Even just scrolling their phone or talking to you. The nightmares can’t get in.

So we started a group. There’s only five of us right now. We crash at whoever’s place is safest, and we sleep in shifts. One of us always stays up. We’ve got snacks, caffeine, cheap horror movies, and a journal where we write down anything strange. One kid brings his dog—she growls at nothing sometimes, but nothing ever gets in when she’s around.

We don’t call it a club. We’re not heroes. We’re just tired kids who don’t want to vanish.


But there’s another group now.

They want to sleep.
They call it “joining the other team.”
They say the dreams show them what’s coming—and it’s better to be on the right side before the world flips.

They talk different now. Not all the time, just… when they think no one’s listening.
One of them told me the nightmares aren’t nightmares. “They’re the only thing telling the truth.”

They go out of their way to sleep alone. In basements, on floors, in abandoned houses.
They want to be seen. But not by us.



Last week, one of them asked to crash with us—just for a night. Said he wanted to “see how the other side lives.” We let him. He laid down in the corner, didn’t speak, didn’t move. Just smiled.

In the morning, one of my friends said he’d heard whispering. Two voices. From both sides of the room.
And when I looked over, the kid’s eyes were open. But he was still breathing like he was asleep.

Then, a couple nights ago, during a match—someone’s mic flicked on in our party, but none of us were talking. It was just static at first… then a voice I didn’t recognize said:
“Hold the line.”

Then it cut. That was it. But none of us moved for like ten seconds. We just sat there, staring at the respawn screen.



I don’t know what this is. I don’t know if we’re safe.
But if you two are real—if the sisters at the coffee shop are reading this—I think it’s happening everywhere.
And I think this is only the beginning.

I’m not writing this to ask for help. I just needed someone to know.
Someone who still cares about keeping the light on for strangers.

We don’t have a name. We don’t wear matching bracelets or any of that crap. But some kids online started calling us Watchers, and I guess that’s stuck.

So yeah. Watchers. Not soldiers. Not saints. Just kids who don’t want to forget what it feels like to stay human.

I’ve posted this same thing—or close to it—in a few other subreddits too.
If this is happening to you… you’re not alone.

Join us.

And if you heard it—
we’re here to hold the line too.

I eat high-protein sources and few carbs at night.

I drink about 4 liters a day, but I still feel dehydrated.

I don’t know if this counts, but I walk daily with heavy backpacks on the street. My route has frequent inclines and declines, and it takes me about 10 minutes on average.  

Do you feel that your diet meets your energy and well-being needs? Or do you feel tired, excessively hungry, or deficient in anything?

1l6o8mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1l6o8mk/does_vyvanse_cause_severe_anxietydepression/,Does Vyvanse cause severe anxiety/depression?,"Long story short, I have not been officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I did recently use a telehealth service and the medical professional says it sounds like i do and prescribed me 30mg Vyvanse. Ive never taken any psych meds before. I bought the generic vyvanse because the name brand was too expensive. 

I want to preface by saying ive never really struggled with anxiety before in fact ive always had a strong sense of self confidence and thats a part of me that i could also rely on, it got me through tough times. But i did have SOME underlying anxiety before vyvanse because i recently lost my job. 

Day 1 of taking vyvanse I had coffee at the same time (i dont anymore i wait 90 min now) but that effect was magical. I felt superhuman, literally anything felt possible and i had the good mood and energy to do it.  That lasted about 20 minutes then went into just as big of a dip the other direction, overwhelmed by dread and hopelessness, why even try..etc. Then it stabilized to back to a normal feeling with flashes/remnants of the dread. But no benefits really noticed, I was able to start tasks but I kept starting them then jumping to another one before finishing. Eventually back to doom scrolling on my phone, procrastinating..etc. Although i did have some kind of ""background effect"" that vyvanse was active but no real benefit from it. 

I took it every day for the next 4 days with the same outcome. I think i was slightly more productive but not enough to actually get anywhere. Yesterday and today i didnt take it, to see what would happen and i have been overwhelmed by severe anxiety and depression. The minimal benefit is not worth this level of torment. What i cant figure out is if im naturally feeling this way (loss of job/fear of uncertainty) and the vyvanse has been masking it or if this is a result/side effect of the vyvanse. Do i need a higher dose or just stay off it? Has anyone else felt this way?

I spit them out and realized they were piece of my teeth. From the pic you can see it looks the top layer of the back of my bottom tooth just chipped right off. Not just a little corner piece but like the entire top part but only the back layer of it?

5 months ago I went to the dentist and they advised Invisalign since they said my top teeth were hitting my bottom teeth and wearing out the top layer of it (that’s why the top layer of the bottom teeth are translucent). I asked if it was urgent and they told me it could become so once I got older. So I went home and thought about it the past 5 months (the cost, the travel, other logistics, etc) but I didn’t think a part of the tooth was just chip off 5 months later or I’d have acted faster. 

I’m going to make an appointment with a dental office nearer home tomorrow and tell them what happened and to schedule something asap. What else should I tell them? Any insights to what else can cause this “seemingly” sudden chip? To add, I do not eat sour candies often (just maybe once a week or so).

Everything in Bellmore slowed and became heavier as the rain continued to fall steadily; inside, the sound of jazz blended with the aroma of espresso and other coffees. Samantha Richard resides close to a tiny café called Quiet Rose Coffee. ""Hello, what can I get you?"" the barista said with a smile as she walked in. Although chai lattes are her signature drink, Samantha noticed that they were not offered when she looked at the menu. ""What's the specialty drink?"" she sought to know from the barista. She went into further detail by naming the drink. 



After purchasing the beverage, Samantha sat down as usual. She picked up her journal and began writing about her newly acquired drink while she was seated. She became distracted by listening to jazz as she perused the pages. 



After some time, a shadowy man entered. Samantha has no idea who this man is. But everyone around her knows who he was; they gossip among themselves.



He was known as Cody Richard.

She hadn't found out yet.

But everybody in Bellmore did.



The barista stumbled as he moved forward. ""What can I get for you?"" 

""Please, one cream, black coffee."" He says to her. 



His tone was deep, low, and serene. Samantha's heart pounded. 

He had a peculiar quality; he was cautious but not particularly dangerous. As if a secret were wearing human skin.



Due to space constraints, Cody had to sit across from her. He hardly glanced at her. He tapped his finger against his cup with his eyes forward. But even in his silence, he carried weight. In his innermost thoughts, he is considering his next mission.



Samantha was unaware that she was seated across from one of the town's most infamous mafia figures.

Additionally, Cody was unaware that the rainy days had the power to completely alter the course of events.



Samantha tried to clear her throat to get his attention, but he remained silent and continued to stare out. The gesture, an implicit challenge or invitation, hung in midair—yet he didn’t respond.

From its roots in Fela Kuti’s fusion of Yoruba rhythms, jazz, and funk, Afrobeat has grown into a cultural force. Today, it blends Ghanaian highlife, Congolese soukous, and West African percussion to create a sound that resonates across continents.

Top artists like Burna Boy, Wizkid, Tiwa Savage, Mr Eazi, Stonebwoy, and Black Coffee are shaping this movement — and the world is listening. Afrobeat is more than just music; it’s style, language, identity, and cultural pride.

We’ve just published a deep dive into its rise, influence, and what’s next for the genre. Read it here:

1l6nvok,https://www.reddit.com/r/norsk/comments/1l6nvok/using_bokmål_in_bergen/,Using Bokmål in Bergen,"Hi everyone! 

For the past 1.5 year I have been learning Norwegian Bokmål using Duolingo and really seem to get a good grasp of it. I have just started section 5 (which is the last of the entire course). 

I know a lot of people say Duolingo will never allow you to properly understand and speak a language. And I do have to admit that throughout the course I have already started forgetting some vocabulary, albeit mostly about topics I don’t care too much about. I do read Aftenposten on a daily basis, and watch several Norwegian series etc. That does help me greatly in not just improving my vocabulary but also building knowledge on the Norwegian culture. 

Now.. my boyfriend and I plan on going to Bergen this summer, just for a week trip. From what I know, Scandinavian people aren’t too fond of ‘outsiders’ trying to speak their language if they don’t master it enough. I know, because we Dutch people are alike in that regard. And, probably more important to note, Bergen apparently uses its own dialect. 

However… I’ve been dying to give it a shot and see how far I can get with what I’ve learned so far. Would it be too crazy to think I can have at least some sort of conversation with people in Bergen using solely Bokmål? If of course anyone would ‘allow’ me to practice. 

For what it’s worth: when I went to Sweden just last Christmas, I was able to use my Norwegian in a few cases (and I don’t mean just asking for a coffee). I know they’re different languages, but stil.. everyone I spoke there understood me without any struggle. 

So.. anyone who could shine a light on my question? Maybe a bit too long of a post for a question like this. 😂

1l6noea,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1l6noea/how_to_believe_and_how_intensely_should_you/,How To Believe And How Intensely Should You Believe,"This has been the question for many time and again but I don’t think people quite understand what it even means to believe something. For starters belief by itself is **not** necessary. I have accidentally manifested many many things without believing in them first and in fact when I manifest things intentionally it’s a 50/50 success rate where I do believe and get results and I don’t believe and get results. 

I’ll give you some examples of what manifestations I’ve had just so you understand I’m talking from experience. 

I manifested receiving checks in the mail without believing my affirmations, I’ve manifested art clients coming out of the blue without believing (and only thinking it once no less), and one of my biggest successes is I’ve manifested my dad and grandma insistently and sincerely suggesting I should be a model. That’s a huge one because that’s verbatim what I affirmed. The affirmation was “people tell me I should be a model all the time” mind you I’m a man so that’s rather strange to hear and also I didn’t think of myself as *that* attractive to begin with. This was also only affirmed once and happened within 4 hours of thinking it so that furthers my point that belief isn’t **necessary**. 

The manifestations I’ve achieved with belief were by sleeping in the desire. I manifested 2 weeks off of work and a remarkably close manifestation of becoming a manager at my job (Things lined up so profoundly the very next day that if I didn’t choose against it then the conclusion would’ve been forgone.) 
I also manifested hummingbirds appearing instantly (within 30 seconds) by really really focusing on 3 separate occasions. 


So now that you can see it’s not the blind leading the blind I’d like to impart some clarity I find useful. So what does it mean to believe really? It means to think something to be **true**, and the truth is where the real  definition is found. 

**Truth is nothing more than the presence of a thing.** If I said that a dinosaur was right beside you, you would think that to be false thus you wouldn’t believe it. **But** if I said that and a dinosaur was present before you, you would believe because the statement would then be true. 

Something to note as well is that the presence of a thing is irrelevant to your perception of its presence. Say you’re in your room and you then close your eyes, does your inability to perceive all the details of your room make it any less present? No, the truth is that you’re still in your room regardless if it’s known to you. 

The only reason you don’t believe what you imagine is because you don’t believe in the presence of what you imagine. You don’t believe that you’re looking at an object as you would believe with your “physical” eyes.  You don’t believe that something is present, thus you don’t believe that it’s true. 

Neville mentions in one of his lectures that “you cannot smell the fragrance of a rose if there was not one present” (paraphrased) and the same applies to everything you imagine. 
You can’t feel unless something makes contact with your nerves. 
You can’t smell unless something makes contact with your olfactory system. 
You cannot hear unless a vibration makes contact with your eardrum. 
You can’t see unless light reflects off an object and makes contact with your eyes, nor taste with chemicals and the tongue. 
And most importantly you cannot imagine unless something makes contact with your “6th sense” your sense of knowing. 

If there wasn’t something there you couldn’t perceive it so it IS real and present, and interpreting what you imagine in this context is how you’re able to believe it. 

Now onto how intensely you should believe. I think it would be best to just test it on different things and let that build your faith. Try believing things as you would seeing with your eyes and try just thinking/affirming with other things. Mix it up to let yourself find out how you should, be loose with it.  It’s dependent upon you solely in the end, Neville coined believing an “art” after all. 

But there is one point of clarity I’d like to leave you with so you can have confidence in not feeling so obliged to focus all the time. And that’s this, you **don’t need** to persist 24/7. As long as you’re not thinking against it call it a success and move onto a new subject to test just as you would plant a seed and not dig it out of the ground. As long as you set it in motion it’s certain. Here’s an analogy to show you what I mean. 

Imagine you’re in a ship in space that’s absolutely motionless, completely inert. If something were to even slightly brush against it, it would move. And if no outside force were to push against it, it would potentially traverse trillions of miles, all from that slightest touch (after a LONG of course.) It’s the thinking against something that stops it from coming to fruition. We often do this accidentally in the form of worrying “will it work?” or asking ourselves “where is it?” 

Just practice with simple things you don’t care about like coffee or free fast food. And if you have any objections I’d like to hear them! Every mistake is a learning opportunity after all :) ",5,1749418801.0,NevilleGoddard,0,1.0,False

I’m not really sure how to write something like this. It feels weird asking for help, but I guess sometimes you just have to speak up when you’re struggling.

I’m 16 and living alone in Moldova. Earlier this year, I lost both of my grandparents. They were more than family to me. They raised me, they were my home, and now that they’re gone, everything feels different. Since then, I’ve been trying to hold everything together on my own. I’m still in school, finishing up exams right now, and trying to keep the house in order, but it’s been a lot.

My mom checks in when she can, but she has a full family to take care of. I can’t really rely on her for support. My stepfather doesn’t want me living in their home. He never really accepted me and just assumes I’m fine on my own here, but the truth is I’m not. I’m struggling, and my mom wants to help me, but she’s barely making it herself. Every time she tries to give me a little money, he yells at her and refuses to support me in any way. I’ve been doing my best to survive day by day, but even covering basic needs like food and essentials is getting hard. I’m planning to start working soon, hopefully next week, but right now things are really tight.

If anyone is able and willing to help, even just a little, I’d be really grateful. I’m not asking for pity or expecting anything, I just thought maybe someone out there might be willing to lend a hand.

My Buy Me a Coffee link is in my Reddit profile. I’m not just asking for help for nothing either. I make music, design graphics, and mess around with code as an entry-level programmer. Just a student doing his best to move forward. Life’s been tough lately, but I’m still here, creating whenever I can. It’s not always easy balancing everything, but creating keeps me going.

If you want to support what I do, every coffee helps more than you think. I also take commissions, so if you need a beat, a design, or anything else I can help with, feel free to DM me on Instagram.

Thanks for taking a moment to read this. It honestly means more than you know.

The bustling streets of Chicago thrummed with energy, alive like a pulsating vein. The chirping of birds barely pierced the cacophony as people flowed in vibrant waves, reminiscent of industrious ants. It was just another day in the city, where towering corporate giants competed for dominance in the skyline. In this concrete jungle, nature seemed to have taken a backseat, leaving behind a testament to human ingenuity and ambition.

In the heart of this city, tucked away in a modest law firm, there was John, a tall figure with long, flowing black hair. His demeanor was laid-back, a stark contrast to the relentless ambition that surrounded him. Rather than striving to climb the career ladder or earn awards, John clocked in each day simply for the promise of next month's paycheck. While others chased glory, he settled into a comfortable routine, finding solace in the predictable rhythm of life in the office.

""Hey, dude, the coffee machine is busted again! Can you work your magic on it? I seriously can't handle this place without my caffeine fix,"" Michel said, exasperated.

""Of course! But honestly, we need a real solution, not just a quick punch. Slapping it around won't keep it going forever,"" John replied, rolling his eyes.

""I feel you. I tried to tell the higher-ups, but they just brushed me off, saying there's no budget for a new one,"" Michel said, throwing his hands up in frustration. ""It's like they don't get how essential coffee is for our survival here!""

""Look, you can't really complain---it's time to learn how to make your own coffee,"" John said with a playful grin. ""Trust me, it's a budget-friendly solution.""

Michel raised an eyebrow and responded, ""You always have this knack for doing everything yourself, don't you?""

John shrugged, a hint of mischief in his eyes. ""What can I say? It's all about being productive.""

""More like wasting time if you ask me,"" Michel countered with a chuckle, shaking his head.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, John wrapped up his usual tasks, his mind almost on autopilot from years of repetition. He bid farewell to his colleagues, the familiar warmth of camaraderie lingering in the air, before making his way home.

His house, a modest middle-class abode, held no grandeur, yet it pulsed with a sense of safety and comfort. The moment he stepped inside, he felt the weight of the day lift as he sank into the softness of the couch. His eyes were drawn to a cherished photograph hanging on the wall---a snapshot that always seemed to brighten his space. It was a portrait of Emily, his childhood friend, her radiant smile capturing the essence of their shared laughter and countless adventures. In that moment, the world outside faded away, and he was transported back to simpler times, filled with warmth and joy.

""Someday,"" John murmured, his heart full of dreams and nostalgia.

John didn't want the day to slip away without hearing Emily's soothing voice, so he picked up his phone and dialed her number with hopeful anticipation. However, after a few rings, the call was met with the sound of her voicemail.

""Guess she's sleeping,"" he murmured to himself, imagining her peacefully resting, oblivious to the world around her. It was a comforting thought, but he couldn't shake the desire to hear her laugh and share in the moments of their day, even just through the phone.

As the first rays of sunlight pierced through the curtains, John stirred from his slumber, ready to greet the new day. He slipped out of bed, the familiar routines drawing him in like a comforting embrace. After whipping up his favorite breakfast of golden eggs and sizzling sausages, he donned his trusty black suit, its fabric crisp and sharp against his skin. With a quick glance in the mirror, he stepped outside and hopped into his car, ready to head to work.

As John navigated the morning traffic on his way to work, his eyes drifted to the cheerful little shaking head dog bobbing on his dashboard. It was one of those classic toys, the kind you often see in cars, with its head happily nodding along. But there was a quirk---this little pup shook its head only to the right, completely ignoring the left. At first, it didn't bother John; he chuckled at its eccentricity.

However, the more he glanced at it, the more his frustration simmered. Why wouldn't it shake left? The thought nagged at him, growing more persistent until he finally decided he couldn't take it anymore.

On a quiet stretch of road, he pulled over and turned his attention to the obstinate toy. There, wedged in the mechanism, he spotted a small rock that was causing all the trouble. John furrowed his brow and set about prying it loose, spending a good 15 minutes wrestling with it. Just when he thought he might give up, he finally dislodged the rock with a triumphant yank.

Taking a deep breath, relief washed over him as he settled back into the driver's seat. With a renewed sense of purpose, he hit the gas and continued on his way, now accompanied by a head-shaking dog that would finally nod in agreement with him.

John hurried to the building, running a bit late as usual, but today felt different. As he stepped into the elevator, he was taken aback to find Emily standing there. His heart raced, drowning out all other thoughts.

After an awkward six seconds, he finally mustered the courage to speak. ""Oh, hi there, Emily,"" he said, trying to keep his voice steady.

""Hey, John,"" she replied with a disinterested tone. ""How's it going?""

""I'm alright, thanks for asking,"" he said, feeling his palms sweat. ""But if you don't mind me asking, what brings you to a law firm?"" The moment the question slipped out, he wished he could take it back, sensing it was a misstep.

""Oh, just some routine stuff,"" Emily said, her eyes focused elsewhere, as if already thinking of her next appointment.

The elevator doors opened, and she stepped out with barely a glance back. John wanted to ask her about the call from yesterday, but before he could gather his thoughts, she was already gone.

""She's probably in a hurry,"" he told himself, trying to convince his racing heart that it was nothing more than that. But a flicker of disappointment lingered---he couldn't shake the feeling that their conversation had been a lost opportunity.

Taking a moment to center himself, John inhaled deeply, pushing aside the distractions that came with Emily's presence. He dove back into his work, but after a grueling hour at his desk, his stomach grumbled insistently, urging him to visit the cafeteria.

As he made his way there, he spotted Michel standing by the notorious broken coffee machine, a look of pure exasperation etched across his face.

""God damn this thing! It's utterly useless! All I want is a cup of coffee---why is that so much to ask for?"" Michel vented, his frustration palpable.

""Hey John! How's your day treating you?"" he turned and asked as John approached.

""Just the usual, nothing out of the ordinary,"" John replied, casting a glance at the offending machine.

""Let me give it a shot,"" John offered, stepping up to the machine and giving it a firm shake. To no surprise, it remained stubbornly silent and unyielding.

Feeling a surge of irritation boil within him, John's frustration broke loose, and in a spontaneous reaction, he delivered a swift punch to the coffee machine. A hollow thud echoed in the air.

""Fucking hell! Now I guess it's tea for me again,"" Michel grumbled, shaking his head at the now even more injured machine.

John's chest tightened with an unshakable ache, a sensation he couldn't quite place. Just then, the door swung open, revealing Emily, her laughter mingling with the manager's voice, brightening the room around her.

Michel, ever the instigator, shot a teasing grin in John's direction. ""Oh, so this is your crush, huh?""

John immediately shook his head, his cheeks warming. ""No, she's just a friend,"" he insisted, though the flutter in his stomach suggested otherwise.

""You should take her out for dinner or something,"" Michel urged, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. ""It's been ages since I've seen that look on your face.""

For a fleeting moment, John tried to brush off the suggestion, just as he always had. After all, the thought of taking that leap felt terrifying. Yet, the ache in his heart pushed him to reconsider, urging him to dig a little deeper into his feelings.

""What do I have to lose?"" he pondered, a spark of hope igniting within him. ""Once she understands how deeply I care for her, we could be truly happy together.""

With a newfound resolve, John amassed years of buried courage and set his sights on Emily. As he took each hesitant step toward her, he rehearsed his words in his mind, crafting a speech he had envisioned countless times before. This time, however, it felt different---this time, he was ready to face his heart.

""Hey Emily, do you have any plans tonight? I'd love to hit up that new restaurant and catch up!"" John proposed, a hopeful smile crossing his face.

""Sorry, John! I've got an important meeting I can't miss,"" Emily replied, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear as she headed to the elevator with her manager. ""But let's definitely find another time soon!""

It took John six seconds to realize what happened. At that moment, John felt as if the air had been sucked out of the room. His mind went blank, and a thousand thoughts raced through his head, leaving him momentarily frozen in disbelief.

""Hey man, I get it. That one stings,"" Michel said, stepping in with a sympathetic pat on John's back. ""But remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea! Just keep casting your line.""

John went through the motions of his day, but something wasn't right---his mind felt clouded and resistant, like it was wrapped in a fog. When the workday finally came to an end, he slid into his car and started the engine, but his focus was miles away, tangled in thoughts about Emily.

""Maybe she really does have an important meeting,"" he reasoned, ""or perhaps she just needs a quiet evening to recharge. She did seem overwhelmed.""

Yet, no matter how he tried to rationalize it, his heart didn't ease. It pounded fiercely against his chest, each thump echoing louder than the last as he navigated the familiar streets.

Finally, overwhelmed, John pulled his car to the side of the road, frustration bubbling to the surface. Years of unspoken feelings, disappointment, and buried pain surged within him like a tidal wave. In a burst of emotion, he slammed his forehead against the steering wheel, letting the raw anguish spill out. He repeated the motion, desperate for release, until a spark of clarity broke through the storm.

In that moment of stillness, one thought crystallized in his mind: Today is the day. He would finally reveal to Emily how deeply he felt.

With a heart full of determination, he stepped into his house, the weight of the moment pressing on his chest. Tonight was the night---he could feel it. All he had to do was wait for the right time to call.

He didn't overthink it. No rehearsed lines, no backup plans. Just one unwavering thought consumed him:

""I'll tell her I love her, and I will be truly happy.""

As the clock struck 10 PM, he picked up his phone and dialed her number. Each ring felt like an eternity, every sound magnified in the quiet of his home. He held his breath, heart racing, until finally, she answered.

""Hello?"" Emily's voice came through, bright and familiar.

""Emily, I love you. I always have. Since our childhood, climbing trees and sharing secrets. Remember those school days? Cheating off each other like we were masterminds? I loved everything about you---your confidence, your persistence, that radiant smile. The way your short hair catches the light. Your unique style... I love you, Emily.""

The words poured out without restraint, as if every younger version of himself had suddenly taken the reins, spilling out emotions that had been locked away for far too long.

But then, silence. A thick, suffocating silence that stretched on, feeling like poison coursing through his veins.

Had she hung up? Panic gripped him as he whispered to himself, ""She hung up!""

His gaze fell to the picture he had of her---the one he cherished, the one that had inspired him day after day. But now, it felt like a cruel mockery.

In an instant, he found himself jolting awake on his couch, heart still pounding, mind heavy with the remnants of a dream that felt all too real.

""What a terrible dream,"" he murmured, the sting of reality washing over him.

And yet, deep down, it felt like a prelude to something more---something he needed to confront.

He glanced at his phone and was startled to see six missed calls. They were all from Emily, along with an unread message that made his heart race.

""Hey John, I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I'm so grateful for your honesty, even if it may be too late. I've always loved you---loved how handy and organized you are. Remember when we were kids? You'd bring me a new flower every time we met, each one more beautiful than the last, as if you could summon them from thin air.

You were my rock, always there when I needed you. But now, it's too late for us. I married Jake, your manager, and looking back, I realize it was a mistake I'll regret for the rest of my life. He treats me terribly, barely acknowledging my existence.

Sometimes, I wish you could rescue me from this unhappy choice, but reality is far from the fairy tales we dreamed about as kids. Still, I want you to know I genuinely wish you the happiness I can't find. I love you, John.""

Emily.

When John read the message, a surge of emotions crashed over him like waves against the shore. The brightest among them was sheer happiness, as he realized Emily felt the same way about him---he hadn't wasted his life waiting for her. Yet, beneath that joy lay a deep concern for the woman he loved.

""How can I leave her with him? I can't do that to her,"" he murmured, summoning his inner strength. He hopped into his car, adrenaline pulsing through him as he slammed down the gas pedal, his heart racing in tandem. The toy on his dashboard shook back and forth, only nodding to the left---an annoying distraction that he pushed aside. In this moment, he felt like his very existence depended on his next steps.

John kicked down Jake's door, the pistol he bought for self deffence heavy in his grip. The house was silent—no sobs, no Emily. Only Jake, scrambling backward in confusion.

""Where is she? What did you do to her?"" John snarled, advancing.

Jake's hands rose. ""Who? John, what the hell—""

A whisper behind him pleading. ""Save me."" John whirled, but the hallway was empty.

Jake lunged for his phone on the nightstand. ""I'm calling the police!""

The shot rang out. No scream followed. No Emily rushed in. Just the echo, and Jake's body slumping.

""It's over, my love,"" John murmured to the empty room.

They climbed into John's car, the night washed away by their laughter and conversation, utterly indifferent to what had just transpired.

Hours slipped by as they drove through the city, engrossed in each other's company. ""How about breakfast?"" John suggested, his voice bubbling with excitement. ""I know an amazing diner!""

""Anything you want, my love,"" Emily replied, her smile brightening the already sunny morning.

They pulled into a cozy, unpretentious diner that served the usual—pancakes, eggs, and sausages—but to them, it felt like stepping into a palace. Each bite was a celebration.

While they chatted and laughed, curious glances came from the other diners, wondering how such happiness could thrive in an ordinary place.

The diner buzzed around them. Emily laughed as she wiped syrup from her lips. ""I'll be right back,"" she said, squeezing his hand.

Her palm was icy.

The bathroom door swung shut. And The bell over the entrance jingled.

Emily walked in.

Her coat was different. Her hair was shorter. She froze, staring at him.

A sinking feeling gripped his stomach. Then he heard them—the distant wail of police sirens.

John reached for his Emily's half-eaten pancakes—but the plate was clean.

I honestly feel like I’m going crazy and I need an outside perspective before I start questioning my grip on reality. This is going to sound like I’m being overly dramatic, but I swear I’m not exaggerating.

So, I (30M) recently went on a couple of dates with a guy, let’s call him “Ryan” (32M). We matched on a dating app about three weeks ago. He seemed normal, funny, attractive, shared a few of my interests. We messaged back and forth for a few days, and eventually decided to meet for coffee. It went well. No major red flags, just light conversation and a lot of “we should do this again” energy.

Then we went on a second date—dinner and a movie. Again, fine. Nothing intense happened; we didn’t hook up, just kissed goodnight. I told him I had a busy week ahead with work and might be slow to respond, and he was like “No worries, I totally get it.”

Or so I thought.

That was a week and a half ago, and since then… I feel like I accidentally got married?

It started small. He texted me the next morning with a “Good morning, babe 🥰” which was already kind of jarring after just two dates, but I thought, “Okay, maybe he’s just a little affectionate. Not a big deal.” I replied with something neutral, like “Good morning!” and went about my day.

Then came the check-ins. Not texts—check-ins. Like:
	•	“Just thinking about you and wondering what you’re having for lunch 😘”
	•	“Hope work isn’t stressing you out too much. I miss you already.”
	•	“I saw a guy who looked like you at the store and my heart skipped a beat. Can’t wait to see you again ❤️”

Again: TWO DATES.

I tried to keep things light, not reciprocating the level of intensity but not ghosting him outright because I figured maybe I’m just not used to this level of forwardness.

Then it got… worse.

I posted a story on Instagram of a drink I was having with a coworker. Literally just a cocktail on a table, no faces. Within minutes Ryan replied, “Who are you with?”
I said, “Just a friend from work.”
He replied: “You didn’t mention you were going out tonight. 😕”
I was like… okay? That’s weird. We’re not dating exclusively, and I don’t need to run my schedule by him?

That same night, I get a text that says:

“I don’t want to sound crazy, but I feel this really strong connection with you. Like… soulmate level. And it hurts not knowing what you’re doing or who you’re with.”

BRO. WE SHARED FRIES ONE TIME.

I didn’t respond for the rest of the night. The next morning?
	•	“Good morning, my heart. Hope you slept well. I had a dream we were holding hands at your family reunion.”
(???)
	•	“Did I say something wrong? I just feel like you’re pulling away.”
	•	“If I did something to upset you, I wish you’d just talk to me. I’m not used to being ghosted.”

So now, I’m officially freaked out. I stopped responding altogether, and now he’s sending me sad song lyrics and once even texted:

“It’s weird how someone can make you feel like everything is right and then suddenly act like you don’t even exist.”

Again. TWO DATES.

He also somehow found my Venmo and sent me $5 with the caption “for your morning coffee ☕💖” and I was like, nope. Refund. Block. Too much.

Now here’s where I might be the asshole: I straight-up ghosted. No explanation, no message, nothing. I blocked him on everything—phone, Instagram, Venmo, even LinkedIn (he’d viewed my profile twice). I told a friend about all this and she said I probably should’ve just sent a clear “Hey, I’m not feeling this, I wish you the best” message. She said ghosting might’ve made things worse or more confusing for him.

But honestly? I felt unsafe. The level of possessiveness and emotional intensity after two dates was alarming. I didn’t feel like I owed him closure, especially when I felt like he was trying to claim me.

Hi all, you were so helpful with my planning I wanted to recap some of our trip for anyone interested. We stayed in Clifden for the majority of our trip. We loved it and it was a peaceful way to see beautiful scenery and do fun touristy things without being on the road too much. We had young kids so the more relaxed approach was perfect for us. 

The town was lovely and the people were truly great. It was such a happy experience to be able to stay there. It was hard to leave. 

Housing-We stayed at a beautiful self catering apartment through Love Connemara Cottages. They were an absolute pleasure to work with and much more cost effective than getting an Airbnb. We were on one of the main streets and the location could not be beat. I loved the ability to quickly pop out and grab a coffee, drink, meal, or go into a shop. 

Coffee
Walsh bakery- was my favorite place due to the lovely views and wonderful service. The coffee and baked goods were delicious. There were some really nice people that work there. 

Upstairs downstairs-had good coffee and sandwiches. It was hard to get the check quickly here, so I’d ask in advance if you are on a timeline.

We didn’t eat out much since we cooked a lot.
Restaurants 
Mitchell’s-was delicious, fish and chips were good and well priced for the large portion. It was our favorite fish chowder.

Guy’s Pub-this was delicious as well. We did the seafood platter special and had a delicious juicy IPA on draft. They had gorgeous instrumental music in the background for dinner. It was such a great experience. Service was incredibly friendly and prompt despite it being a packed night.

Pubs-Lowry’s live music was spectacular. I loved the interesting mix of songs and my only regret was I passed on it too many times because it was always so busy. 

Mularkey’s-they had such great live music and each night it was different but equally good. The bartenders were all incredible and so personable and friendly. It was so fun going there and the place we will miss the most. 

Griffin’s-some of the people we were with didn’t get the best vibe from the service, but we had no issues. The traditional music was great and we were able to sit on the patio and still hear the music perfectly. 

If you like live music, it’s such a great town. Every night you will be able to find a live band. They stagger the live music nights at the different pubs so there an option for live music in town every night. 

They had plenty of different shops. I liked Love Vintage the most, but each shop was good in their own way. They had a great glass shop that had well priced souvenirs. We loved the really cute bookstore. There were also more typical souvenir shops that had a lot to offer. 

The playground was large with plenty of variety and close to the downtown area. If you are debating a stroller I’d say take it, there’s a hill that tires out the kids.

We were so happy and lucky to have chosen to stay here. I’d highly recommend it if you like easy walking, plenty of pubs and restaurants, live music, nice people, and pretty scenery. 

I’ll go over the tourist spots we visited in the county on another post. ",5,1749418594.0,irishtourism,1,1.0,False

I’m not really sure how to write something like this. It feels weird asking for help, but I guess sometimes you just have to speak up when you’re struggling.

I’m 16 and living alone in Moldova. Earlier this year, I lost both of my grandparents. They were more than family to me. They raised me, they were my home, and now that they’re gone, everything feels different. Since then, I’ve been trying to hold everything together on my own. I’m still in school, finishing up exams right now, and trying to keep the house in order, but it’s been a lot.

My mom checks in when she can, but she has a full family to take care of. I can’t really rely on her for support. My stepfather doesn’t want me living in their home. He never really accepted me and just assumes I’m fine on my own here, but the truth is I’m not. I’m struggling, and my mom wants to help me, but she’s barely making it herself. Every time she tries to give me a little money, he yells at her and refuses to support me in any way. I’ve been doing my best to survive day by day, but even covering basic needs like food and essentials is getting hard. I’m planning to start working soon, hopefully next week, but right now things are really tight.

If anyone is able and willing to help, even just a little, I’d be really grateful. I’m not asking for pity or expecting anything, I just thought maybe someone out there might be willing to lend a hand.

My Buy Me a Coffee link is in my Reddit profile. I’m not just asking for help for nothing either. I make music, design graphics, and mess around with code as an entry-level programmer. Just a student doing his best to move forward. Life’s been tough lately, but I’m still here, creating whenever I can. It’s not always easy balancing everything, but creating keeps me going.

If you want to support what I do, every coffee helps more than you think. I also take commissions, so if you need a beat, a design, or anything else I can help with, feel free to DM me on Instagram.

Thanks for taking a moment to read this. It honestly means more than you know.

1l6nl56,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1l6nl56/medication_for_autismrelated_issues/,Medication for Autism-related issues?,"23M, got diagnosed with Autism Lv.1, OCD, and ADHD relatively late in my life (around age 17) and have been struggling with it for my entire life. My main issues revolve around severe anxiety, depression, mood swings, irritability, and PDA (pathological demand avoidance).

I had some bad experiences with drugs that significantly affected my anxiety in a negative way. I'm still dealing with the consequences. I was prescribed Ativan to help with my anxiety, but had severe side effects (violent impulses and lack of impulse control) that made me quickly discontinue them and asked to be prescribed something else. I eventually got on Cymbalta 20mg which has been a far better experience, but still leaves me wanting. I'm not able to drink coffee or alcohol on it (which is probably better for me in the long run, but I like being able to have my morning coffee and a beer with my friends every now and again), it makes me feel a bit lazy and unmotivated, and I sometimes feel like it can make me more sad than usual. It also takes away some of my good mood swings and generally decreases my energy levels. 

There are other factors that I know negatively affect my condition, such as the fact that I'm terminally online and work mostly from home, both of which contribute to my anxiety and depression. I have relatively few IRL friends and don't really like my area, so I don't get out as much as I'd like to (I'm working on this, but it's been difficult). I also live in a pretty small place with other people who I get along with for the most part but who sometimes just really obviously don't understand what I'm dealing with (I love them but would choose to live alone in a heartbeat if I could).

Psychiatrists are a bit difficult to find in my area but I'd like to gather some notes on experiences other people have had with other medications or therapies for some of the issues I'm having so I'm ready to go as soon as I do find one. What, if any, have helped or hurt you? What are some things I could try besides medication? I'm open to hearing anything and everything.

Meera accidentally discovered flirtatious text messages between her husband and mistress on his laptop.
Meera intended to log in to her design portal.
But then... a small notification came.
It was a woman's name.
One soft click. The chat opened.
""I can still feel you... Can you?""
Followed by a heart emoji.
And then, a photo.
A mirror selfie. Woman's hand on her slightly swollen belly (Probably 5 months). Pregnant.
Meera didn't breathe.
She turned her head slowly to look toward the bed.
Rohit was still sleeping. Peacefully. 
Her heartbeat louded in her ears.
But the truth peeked in.
————————

The soft light of early morning spilled through the gaps in the floral curtains, casting golden streaks across the cream-colored walls of the bedroom. Meera stirred before the alarm buzzed, her motherly instincts now attuned to the faintest movements from the cradle beside the bed. Her baby girl cooed softly, fists waving in the air, eyelids fluttering open.
Meera leaned over, gently lifting her daughter into her arms. She smiled, pressing a pecking to the tiny forehead, inhaling that sweet, warm scent that only babies had.
""Good morning, my little sunshine,"" she whispered, cradling the baby against her chest. ""Did you sleep well?""
The baby gurgled in response, tiny fingers gripping the edge of Meera's nightshirt. She swayed gently, comforting her daughter while glancing toward the clock on the wall. It was 6:10 AM.
Meera walked over to the changing table, humming under her breath as she changed the baby's diaper and wrapped her in a fresh onesie. The baby squirmed playfully, grabbing Meera's fingers and bringing them to her mouth.
""Hungry already, huh? Let's get you some milk before Dadi starts her morning bhajans.""
She stepped out of the bedroom, careful not to disturb Rohit, who was still asleep, his back turned toward her. The sight made her pause. She'd gotten used to him falling asleep before her, but lately, he hadn't even been trying to talk. Every evening, it was the same: a few distracted nods, a tired smile, and a lot of time spent staring at his phone. She told herself it was work pressure. New project. Tight deadlines. That's what he had said.
Still... something felt off.
She shook the thought away and walked toward the kitchen, her feet brushing against the cold tiles of the hallway. The house smelled faintly of incense sticks—probably from the puja room down the hall, where Rohit's mother would soon begin her prayers. The air was quiet, too quiet, like it always was in this household.
Her in-laws slept in the room adjacent to the kitchen. Meera moved silently, not wanting to trigger any passive-aggressive commentary from her mother-in-law about waking the baby too early or using too much hot water. She filled the kettle, grabbed the formula, and began warming the milk while gently rocking her baby with her foot.
""Good morning,"" came a flat voice behind her.
Meera turned. It was her mother-in-law, draped in her usual maroon cotton saree, hair neatly oiled and pulled back.
""Morning, Mummyji,"" Meera replied politely.
""Hmm,"" her mother-in-law said, glancing disapprovingly at the used bottle drying near the sink. ""Still using formula? You should be feeding her yourself. It's better for the child.""
Meera forced a soft smile. ""She's not latching well these days, so I give her both.""
""You should try harder. These shortcuts are not good for babies. We never used all this powder milk nonsense in our time.""
Meera didn't reply. She had stopped defending herself weeks ago. It was easier to nod and stay quiet.
By the time she returned to the bedroom, the baby fed and dozing again, Rohit was awake, sitting at the edge of the bed, checking his phone. He didn't look up when she entered.
""Tea?"" she asked, gently placing the baby back into the cradle.
He mumbled something, still staring at his screen.
She sat beside him. ""Rohit? Want some tea?""
Finally, he looked up. ""Yeah... sure. I've got a call at 8. Can you keep it ready by 7:30?""
""Of course,"" she said, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear. ""You've been sleeping late these days. Everything okay at work?""
""Hmm?"" He glanced back at the screen, clearly distracted. ""Yeah. Just deadlines. A bit much this week.""
She waited, hoping he'd elaborate. He didn't.
Meera nodded slowly. ""Alright. I'll make breakfast too. Anything specific?""
""Anything's fine,"" he said, already getting up. ""I'll shower first.""
He walked into the bathroom, leaving his phone on the bed for a moment. Meera stared at it, tempted to pick it up—not to invade his privacy, but because something about his behavior lately made her stomach twist. But she didn't. She just sat there in the quiet room, the baby gently snoring, the soft sound of running water from the bathroom, and the growing weight in her chest.
She glanced around the room. Their wedding photo still hung on the wall, framed in silver. Rohit had looked so happy that day, his eyes lit up, his arm around her shoulder protectively. She had believed in that picture once. Now, it felt like a souvenir from a life that wasn't hers anymore.
By 7:30, the kitchen was bustling. Her father-in-law was now reading the newspaper at the dining table, sipping his sugarless tea. Her mother-in-law hovered around, adjusting things that didn't need adjusting.
Meera placed a tray on the table: two cups of tea and a small plate of upma.
""Rohit's tea?"" her mother-in-law asked.
""I'll take it to him,"" Meera replied quickly.
She walked back to their room and placed the tea beside his laptop. He was dressed now, seated and typing something furiously.
""Thanks,"" he said without looking.
She stood there for a moment longer than she should have. ""Rohit... are we okay?""
He paused, finally meeting her eyes. ""Yeah. Why wouldn't we be?""
""No reason,"" she said quietly. ""You've just been... a little distant, that's all.""
He looked at her for a long moment, then smiled—small, tight. ""Just work, Meer. Nothing else. Don't overthink.""
She nodded, though her heart didn't believe him.
As she turned to leave, she caught her reflection in the mirror. Tired eyes, hair hurriedly tied up, nightclothes slightly stained from baby milk. She looked like a woman trying too hard to hold things together.
But she had to. For her daughter. For herself.
And maybe, just maybe, to figure out what was slowly breaking in the silence around her.
....
Later that morning, with the baby finally asleep again and the kitchen duties done, Meera retreated to her small workspace in the corner of the bedroom. Her laptop was already open, a half-finished design project blinking on the screen. She glanced at the clock—11:12 AM. Right on time.
Her phone buzzed with a video call request. A soft smile tugged at her lips when she saw the name flash.
She answered, and Nikita's cheerful face filled the screen.
""Finally! Look who remembered her friends,"" Nikita teased, sipping from a huge mug that read 'No Code Before Coffee'.
""Oh, please. I'm the one who has to wait for the great Nikita to finish her diva-level client calls.""
Nikita rolled her eyes dramatically. ""They don't pay me enough to pretend I care this much. But let's talk about you, Momma Meera. Where's my chubby little niece?""
Meera turned the camera toward the cradle, lowering her voice. ""Sleeping, finally. She's been fussy this week—some kind of growth spurt, I think.""
""God, she's so cute even when she's knocked out,"" Nikita said, her voice softening. ""She has your eyes. Big and questioning.""
""She has my sleepless nights too,"" Meera joked. ""And my complete lack of a routine.""
""Motherhood looks good on you. Exhausted, but glowing.""
""Glowing?"" Meera laughed. ""More like glowing from the kitchen heat and baby vomit.""
They both giggled, the kind of laughter that came from knowing each other too well. There was no judgment, no formalities. Just easy conversation, the kind that Meera missed deeply in this house.
""So how's life in the Verma household?"" Nikita asked, quirking a brow.
Meera exhaled slowly. ""Same old. Mummyji started her rant this morning about formula again. Apparently, I'm raising the baby like a 'lazy millennial.' And Rohit... well, he's just... there.""
""Still acting like a ghost?"" Nikita asked gently.
""Yeah. He talks, he eats, he works... but it's like living with a stranger sometimes.""
""Have you tried asking him directly?""
""I did,"" Meera said, tugging slightly at the hem of her dupatta. ""He says it's just work. Deadlines and pressure. But... I don't know, Nikita. He used to talk to me, laugh with me. Now he hardly looks at me.""
There was a brief silence. Nikita's expression softened.
""You're not imagining it, Meer. You've always been intuitive. If something feels off, maybe it is.""
Meera nodded slowly. ""But I don't want to jump to conclusions either. Things change after a baby. I'm different too. Tired, cranky, barely have time for myself—let alone for him.""
As the screen went dark, Meera sat still for a moment. A warmth lingered from the call—a reminder of who she had been before motherhood, before marriage started to feel like a quiet war. It was a brief moment of peace, of connection. And she had no idea how much that moment would haunt her later.
.....
It was almost 7:45 in the evening when Meera heard the front gate open. She paused halfway through folding the baby's washed clothes and looked at the door. The baby was sleeping again, giving her a brief moment of calm in the otherwise long and tiring day.
The door creaked slightly, then clicked shut.
Rohit had returned.
She walked out of the room slowly, wiping her hands on her dupatta. He was already in the hallway, placing his laptop bag on the side table, loosening his tie.
""You're late,"" she said gently, careful not to sound accusing.
""Traffic,"" he replied shortly, without even looking at her.
Meera gave a small nod. ""I've kept your tea. Want me to heat it?""
He sighed, brushing back his hair. ""I'm not in the mood, Meera. I've had a long day.""
""Okay,"" she said quietly, ""but you should have something. I can get you dinner in ten minutes.""
He didn't answer. He had already taken out his phone and was staring at the screen, thumbs tapping quickly. His face was tense, eyebrows pulled slightly, jaw tight.
Meera stood there awkwardly for a second, then stepped back toward the kitchen. She warmed up the dal and sabzi she had prepared earlier and set the plate on the dining table. Her father-in-law was reading the newspaper, and her mother-in-law was sitting near the window, watching something on her phone with earphones in.
""Rohit has come,"" Meera said, as politely as she could.
Her mother-in-law didn't respond. Just gave a small ""hmm"" and continued watching her video.
Rohit came out after a while, freshly washed, in his home t-shirt and shorts. He sat at the table, picked up his spoon, and began eating without a word.
Meera sat across from him, pretending to go through her phone, though her eyes kept going back to his face.
He was eating faster than usual, still glancing at his phone in between bites. A small notification buzzed. He tilted his phone slightly away as he checked it.
Something twisted in Meera's stomach.
She forced a smile. ""You're not even tasting the food.""
""It's fine,"" he said flatly.
""I added a bit more salt to the dal today. Mummyji said it was bland last time.""
""I said it's fine, Meera,"" he repeated, this time more sharply.
The smile on her lips faded. ""Okay. Sorry.""
He didn't say anything after that. Finished the food quickly and got up.
""I've got some work to finish,"" he said, already walking away toward the bedroom.
She watched him leave, her heart heavy. Something felt wrong. It had felt wrong for a while now.
Back in the bedroom, she saw him sitting at the desk, laptop open, typing something fast. But every few minutes, his hand reached for the phone again. A small smile, then a quick swipe of his thumb. His shoulders relaxed only when he was looking at the screen.
Meera sat on the bed, folding the last of the baby's clothes, trying not to stare. But her mind was not quiet anymore.
He hadn't asked about her day. He hadn't even looked at the baby. He used to come home and first pecking their daughter's forehead. Now... nothing.
She took a deep breath. Maybe he's just tired. Maybe work really is difficult. Maybe the new project is taking a toll on him.
Maybe...
But no matter how many times she told herself that, the uneasy feeling didn't go away.
She reached for her water bottle, pretending not to watch him. He chuckled at something on the screen. A soft laugh. The kind of laugh he hadn't shared with her in weeks.
Something cold settled in her chest.
""Rohit,"" she said suddenly.
He looked up, startled.
""Yes?""
""You didn't see the baby today. She laughed for the first time properly. Like a full laugh.""
He blinked. ""Oh.""
""She's started grabbing her toes too. It's cute.""
""Hmm.""
Silence.
Meera looked down at her lap, where her fingers were nervously twisting her dupatta. ""Do you want to see a video? I recorded it.""
""Later,"" he said. ""I'm in the middle of something.""
Her throat tightened. ""Okay.""
She turned away and pulled the blanket over her legs. Her daughter stirred in the cradle beside her. Meera gently leaned over and placed a hand on her tiny belly, soothing her back to sleep.
Behind her, she could still hear the soft tapping of keys.
And the occasional notification sound from his phone.
She didn't turn to look.
She just sat in the dim light of the bedroom, silently repeating to herself.
He's just stressed. He's just stressed. He's just stressed.
....
The house was finally still. The only sound in the room was the slow, steady ticking of the wall clock and the occasional soft sigh from the baby in the cradle. A dim night lamp cast a warm glow over the space, just enough for Meera to see without waking her daughter.
Meera sat on the floor, her back resting against the bed, a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. Her laptop had been acting up again—it was slow, the software freezing every now and then. She had a small website project due tomorrow morning. Nothing complicated—just a simple landing page redesign—but even small tasks felt like mountains these days.
She glanced toward the table where Rohit's laptop sat, charging. He had gone to bed a while ago, already turned toward the wall, his breathing deep and even.
Meera hesitated for a moment. She didn't usually touch his things. But she was tired, and this project had to be finished. Quietly, she stood up, tiptoed to the table, and opened his laptop.
The screen lit up immediately—he hadn't logged out.
She paused. His desktop was cluttered with folders, screenshots, and random documents. She moved the cursor quickly to open the browser, intending to log in to her design portal.
But then... something popped up.
A small notification in the corner.
New message – WhatsApp Web.
She blinked.
It was a woman's name.
Not saved as ""Office"" or ""Client"" or anything formal. Just a name. Plain. Familiar somehow, but her brain didn't catch it in that moment.
She didn't mean to click it.
She really didn't.
But her finger hesitated on the mouse, and before she could think, the cursor moved.
One soft click.
The chat opened.
She stared at the screen.
It was a short message.
""I can still feel you... Can you?""
Followed by a heart emoji.
And then, a photo.
Not vulgar. But not innocent either.
A mirror selfie. Woman's hand on her slightly swollen belly (Probably 5 months). Pregnant.
Meera didn't breathe.

I matched with a cute girl, lets call her Bella (not her name). She was nineteen and even whilst we were just dm’ing I had trepidations about her age. Chatting to her she seemed cool. We share similar interests and, if I’m honest I was lonely so I decided to get a coffee with her.

Bella’s confident and sincere. She’s articulate and has a healthy ambition, I start kind of crushing on her. Neither of us are big drinkers so a first kiss is charmingly sober and clumsy. We took it pretty slowly and but then last night after a night out she texted me and invited me over.

We were kissing and it was getting heavy and she told me that she hadn’t done this before. Initially, I thought she meant online dating but then I realised I was being an idiot and she was actually trying to tell me that she was a virgin.

Whilst modern porn and traditional religious thinking glorifies this sort of “purity”… for a guy looking for a casual romantic relationship taking a girl’s virginity is quite a daunting prospect.

Firstly, the constant and regular communication and check ins required for the comfortable navigation of consent in this situation, combined with her lack of experience is bound to make the sex awkward and monotonous. I imagine it’d be devoid of the spontaneity and improvisation that can come with two experienced and sexually confident partners.

Secondly, I’m also pretty concerned that she might start feeling a way about me if I were to start sleeping with her. It’s natural to crush on the first person you sleep with, lord knows I spent years romanticising my first girlfriend. But being fresh out of a relationship and on the brink of embarking on a very time consuming stage of my career, I’m not sure I want to move that quickly with a girl I’m just starting to know.

I left last night without following through. Bella’s still very keen to see me again and part of me really wants to. I like her. And I know I’d be a good partner for this milestone for her, but I’m scared of hurting her in the future by not being able to commit. Add on the natural preconceptions people will place around a 27 year old taking a 19 year olds virginity… all in all, it gives me a lot of trepidation.

The truth is, there’s already a curious power in balance that comes with age. Her lack of experience only heightens it.

Help guide a brother through this… I’m trying real hard to differentiate what’s right and what’s me just following my dick… Do I cut this girl loose? Or do I sleep with her?",0,1749418234.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

1l6ne4i,https://i.redd.it/4zfk0ea0ur5f1.jpeg,Summer heat without AC,"2nd edit;
Important additional note:
This is government housing, and window AC units are not allowed here. I’m not permitted to install any window-mounted air conditioners, which is part of why I had to come up with so many creative solutions. I do technically have a built-in wall PTAC unit (like in hotels/motels), but as I explained, it’s extremely inefficient, struggles badly due to the brick wall heat, leaks water, and still costs me $100+ a month to run while barely cooling. So all of these layered strategies are what I’ve had to build to survive.

Edited post to explain why I don’t use AC…

I live on the third (top) floor of an apartment complex, on a fully west-facing wall made entirely of brick. The windows in my unit are huge — nearly the size of the entire wall. In winter, this actually works in my favor because the bricks absorb the sunlight during the day and radiate warmth all night, so I rarely have to run my heater. But in summer, it turns my apartment into an oven. The brick holds heat well into the evening, and being on the top floor with no insulation above makes it even worse. Once this apartment heats up, it wants to stay hot.

To make it even more challenging, I don’t have any cross-breeze windows. All three windows are on the west side only. Only two of those three windows even open — and when they do, it’s only about 6 to 12 inches. So I have very limited airflow options and no way to create a true cross-breeze.

Because I don’t have central air and I’m working with a tight budget, I’ve had to build a multi-layered system to survive the summer heat.

The first thing I focused on was blocking as much direct sun as possible. I covered my windows with cardboard wrapped in aluminum foil (shiny side out), and then added Mylar emergency blankets behind that for extra insulation. This blocks a huge amount of heat from ever entering in the first place. I designed the coverings so I can still easily open and close the windows for ventilation when the outside air is cooler.

Timing the windows has been key. I open them late at night after the sun goes down while the outdoor air is cooler than inside, and allow the apartment to air out as much as possible. I have a box fan in each window, even though the windows only pull up about 10 inches. As soon as the outside temperature equals or exceeds the indoor temperature, I shut the windows completely and seal in the cooler air. Once the windows are closed, I run a couple of fans to keep the air circulating and help maintain the cool pocket I’ve captured.

Since I can’t rely on AC, I built a DIY cooling system using reusable ice packs. I freeze large freezer blocks and place them directly in front of the box fans to create a kind of homemade AC effect — the fans blow the cooled air across the ice and into the room. I also have a cooling foot bath where I place one of these reusable ice blocks in cool water to help my core temperature drop quickly while I sit and soak my feet.

I purchased a vest that holds ice packs which I can wear as-is or over a wet T-shirt. I got that on Amazon for $35. I also have one of those gel neck wraps that you keep in the freezer (around $15). I purchased a similar ice vest for my dachshund for $35. She also has a wet T-shirt that I keep in the fridge to wear under her ice vest for extra layering.

Because even my electronics overheat, I lay my phone and devices on ice packs wrapped in towels to keep them from shutting down inside the apartment. Every little bit helps.

Of course, hydration and electrolyte management are absolutely critical. I eat pinches of light gray Celtic sea salt — the coarse kind that feels kind of wet — which costs about $10. I also use elete Electrolyte Add-in Hydration Drops (Sodium, Magnesium, Potassium & Trace Minerals — Unflavored, All Natural — Leg & Muscle Cramp Relief — Transform Any Drink into a Sports Drink), 4 oz from Walmart (about $15). I take Potassium Magnesium Gummies — High Absorption Magnesium Glycinate 500mg & Potassium Citrate 200mg & Omega 3, B6, D3, K2 & Calcium — Chewable Gummy for Leg Cramps, Immunity & Energy (60 Count, about $15).

I use Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes made from pure genuine Zechstein chloride, which cost about $13. I mix about 30% bath flakes with 70% distilled water and put it in spray bottles, which I spray directly on my skin. It works as a great deodorant and helps absorb magnesium transdermally, which also supports hydration.

At night, I sleep under a cooling blanket that I purchased from Amazon for $22. Because I have CPTSD, I purchased a 7-pound 41” by 60” weighted blanket that is also a cooling blanket. I was able to catch this on sale and got it for $27 (tax included).

I am also intermittent fasting, eating approximately 800 to 1000 calories a day, and I try to eat my meals earlier around noon, with nothing after that. Since digesting food heats up the body, eating earlier allows my core temperature to stay lower during the hottest part of the day.

I purchased a hand-crank ice shaver so that I can make myself snow cones to munch on and keep my core temperature down. I pour my ice protein coffee over it, and it’s really good. I also have about eight ice trays so that I can always have plenty of ice for drinks throughout the day, and I keep a thermos filled with ice water that stays cold for hours.

So these are the things that I’m doing to survive Oklahoma heat with no air conditioning, living on the third floor — the top floor of a solid brick building with giant west-facing glass windows. Ha!

For context: I do technically have a hotel-style wall unit (called a PTAC unit — Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner, like the ones you see in motels). But it’s extremely inefficient for my situation. These units are notorious for leaking water heavily (mine does), and because of my west-facing brick wall, top-floor location, and the heat the bricks hold, the unit simply can’t keep up. Even when I run it, I still end up sweating while paying $100 or more a month for very little actual relief. For me, it just isn’t cost-effective — which is why I’ve had to get creative with all these layered solutions instead.

I'm just a dude who works at a warehouse and likes to game. Nothing weird about me, never believed in ghosts or any of that crap. But something’s happening, and I can’t shake it. It’s this… song. Yeah, a song. Sounds dumb, right? But it’s not. It’s in my head, and it’s not just a catchy tune—it’s doing something to me. To my life. I’m posting this here cause I don’t know where else to go. Maybe someone’s heard this thing before.

It started two weeks ago. I was scrolling YouTube late at night, you know, the usual rabbit hole of dumb videos. Found this weird clip, no thumbnail, just a black screen with the title “Listen Once.” No channel name, no comments, no likes, just… there. I clicked it cause I was bored. Big mistake. It was this melody, no lyrics, just a looping tune—kinda like a music box but off, like it was played on rusty strings. It wasn’t creepy at first, just… stuck with me. I hummed it after the video ended, couldn’t stop. Didn’t think much of it, closed my laptop, went to bed.

Next morning, it’s still in my head. Like, LOUD. I’m brushing my teeth, and I’m humming it without thinking. I try to listen to my usual playlist—metal, rap, whatever—to drown it out, but it’s like the tune weaves into every song. I’d hear Metallica, but underneath, that creepy melody was there, twisting the riffs. I got annoyed, figured it was just an earworm, you know? Like when “Baby Shark” gets stuck in your brain. But this felt… heavier.

By day three, shit got weird. I’m at work, moving boxes, and I notice I’m stacking them in a rhythm. The same rhythm as the tune. My coworker,  he’s like, “Yo, you good? You’re humming that creepy shit all day.” I laughed it off, but I didn’t even realize I was doing it. That night, I’m home, and my dog, Rusty, starts acting up. He’s whining, staring at me, like he’s freaked out. I’m humming again, and he bolts to the corner, tail tucked. I stop, and he calms down. I start again—by accident—and he loses it, barking like I’m a stranger. I shut up quick.

I tried to find the video again. Searched “Listen Once” on YouTube, Google, everywhere. Nothing. Like it never existed. I even checked my browser history—gone. That’s when I started feeling watched, you know? Like something was listening to ME hum the tune. I’d be in my apartment, alone, and hear this faint echo of it, like it was coming from the walls. I’d stop humming, and it’d stop too. But sometimes… it didn’t. One night, I woke up at 3 a.m., pitch black, and the tune was playing. Not in my head—out loud, from my living room. I grabbed my bat, crept out, but nothing was there. No phone, no speakers, just silence when I flipped the light on. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I’d pass out.

Things got worse. I started seeing stuff. Not like monsters or ghosts, but… patterns. The tune was changing things around me. I’d pour coffee, and the steam would swirl in the same rhythm as the melody. The clock in my kitchen—digital, mind you—started ticking in time with it. One night, I’m walking home from a bar, and the streetlights are flickering, matching the beat. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s like the world was syncing up with this damn song.

Then came the voices. Not clear ones, not like “hey , I’m a demon.” Just whispers, mixed into the tune, like they were part of it. I’d hear them when I was alone, saying stuff like “keep going” or “sing it.” I stopped humming after that, clamped my mouth shut, but the tune kept playing in my head, louder, like it was pissed I wouldn’t let it out. I tried earplugs, blasting music, even went to a doctor. He said it was stress, gave me pills. They didn’t do shit. The tune got so loud I couldn’t sleep. I’d lie there, feeling it pulse in my skull, like it was trying to crawl out.

Last week, it took over. I was at the warehouse, and I blacked out. Not like fainting, but like I wasn’t me. My colleaguesaid I was stacking boxes, humming that tune, but my eyes were… wrong. He said they were blank, like I was sleepwalking. I don’t remember any of it. When I “woke up,” I was standing in the break room, holding a box cutter, and Mike was yelling at me to snap out of it. There were scratches on my arms, deep ones, in a pattern that matched the tune’s rhythm. I didn’t do that. I swear I didn’t.

I stopped going to work after that. Locked myself in my apartment, unplugged everything, even taped over my laptop’s webcam. But the tune’s still here. Last night, I saw something in the mirror. Not my reflection—well, it was, but it wasn’t ME. My face was smiling, humming the tune, while I stood there, frozen, not making a sound. The reflection’s mouth moved, and I heard the melody come from it, clear as day. I smashed the mirror, cut my hand bad, but the blood on the floor… it pooled in shapes, like musical notes.

I don’t know what this thing is. It’s not just a song. It’s alive, and it’s using me. I can feel it digging deeper, like it’s rewriting who I am. I’m scared to sleep, scared to leave my place, scared to even think too loud. If I hum it again, I don’t know what’ll happen. Maybe it’ll take me completely. Maybe I’ll end up like that reflection, just a puppet for the tune.

If anyone’s heard this song, or seen that video, please, tell me. I need to know how to stop it. I’m posting this now cause I don’t know how much longer I can fight it. The tune’s playing as I type this, louder than ever, and my fingers are moving to its rhythm. I don’t want to sing. I don’t want to let it out. But it’s so hard to stop.",8,1749417582.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Talking about adult things. You can't actually even perceive this post below a certain chrono threshold and, if you did somehow and are, go study for your SAT kiddo, I'll come help later.)

Beginnings are really hard, so let’s just begin:

**INTRO :** Hi hello, it's [me!](https://imgur.com/a/X66xkE1) I’m a 29 year old (ancient, I know) who is healed and content and very open to finding his lifelong person and partner. I’ve been through a lot by this point, but I’ve decided the struggle has been for a purpose, to singularly make me a kinder, more empathetic person, capable of caring for others and himself that much more purposefully. There will always be something that happens - I think now it’s how we choose to respond to it, as individuals and, hopefully, as a duo. If devotion and laughter and always having each other’s backs is your thing, read on\~

**WHERE YOU AT? :** Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That will likely not remain for much longer as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being grad school, careers, and *the collapse of the United States.*

**A RELATIONSHIP? – \[YES\] :** To me, an ideal relationship isn’t just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say “yeah, might as well.” It’s *all* of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as “babe, dude, lover” all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we’ll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we’re House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that’s okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we’re running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it’s together and with belief in each other. That’s really what I’m looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

**WHAT HE’S LOOKING FOR :** Well if I knew where to find you, I wouldn’t be scrawling all this! Truthfully, I don’t know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It’s really about more who is inhabiting that person? It’s who that image *is* that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor™ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That’s a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior™! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I’m going to guess you’ll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you’re femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, *amazing.* Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical – and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we’re golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

**LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS :** I will attempt, and fail, to be concise - I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that’s just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let’s go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I’d love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my “gotta stay alive until” to hype myself up when things seem grim. I’m also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that’s a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. Let’s make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I’ll save that for after we’ve started chatting - otherwise, I’m just blathering into the void as usual. I’m game for most everything, especially if it’s nerdy, that’s the tl;dr. I’ve never been to a concert so, maybe we can solve that.

**CONCLUSION :** If you’ve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I’m at least a little interesting, I’ve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let’s figure out if we have something here. The “worst” that could happen is that you’ll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We’ll find out I suppose.

That’s all for now, and what an all it was.

Thank you and, take care out there!",1,1749417582.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Maura woke up with a throbbing headache. It took her a minute to remember where she was and how she had gotten there. The sounds were wrong…very wrong. No one was screaming, no one was slamming doors and more importantly, the building did not sound like it was burping with anticipation to shit on its occupants. Crap, she wasn’t home, she wasn’t at work, she was in the damn woods. The birds were singing, some unknown to her bugs were fussing around and creating a mayhem around her…fuck! The little shits bit her. Mosquitos! Now, she remembered. She went camping! For fuck sakes, she was camping. What the hell possessed her to make her think she would do well in open, fresh and clean air, with no traffic, and with birds and bears and shit. Oh, yeah. Her friend Maggie. Maggie was a bitch, but she was Morra’s best friend and currently on top of her hit list. She would kill her once she managed to get up. Fucking crap on a cracker. How much did she drink last night?! Not enough…

Maura had the idiotic inclination to listen to her friend Maggie when she suggested camping. Maggie was a hiker, camper, outdoorsy annoyingly happy person. Maura was not! Fucking gods, saints and every known to theology researchers demons, she was not! Maura was an ER nurse. She knew how to extract things from places where things should not be inserted, ever. She knew how to insert things where things should be inserted. She was quite skilled with a needle and occasional scalpel. Even scissors. She knew how to roll her eyes while still smiling at the countless idiot who “accidently” sat on a bottle or a light bulb. Yes, a light bulb…just as you thought you had seen everything. Then that one came in and the light switch never looked the same again. For crying out loud, if things are meant to come out from that one hole, do not shove anything up there. Buttholes are not meant to test the laws of physics, nor the patience and expertise of the local ER staff. Just don’t! (if you really want to know the limitations of your ass, try Thai food, like the legit spicy, burning your mouth and then everything it touches Thai food. It tastes great going in, and you may need epidural delivering out).

Where was I?

Oh, yeah. Maura and her hatred for the outdoors. Well, she didn’t hate it, but she was out of her element, and she needed coffee. Industrial quantities of it. Why was her head hurting some much? How much did she drink last night. What happened last night? There was something ablaze, a marshmallow maybe, flying in the air, Maggie laughing so hard, that she rolled backwards and fell in the bush behind her chair. Was that before or after the second bottle of wine. It was wine, right? Maggie pulled something home-made out of her backpack, but Maura was too busy examining the creepy woods and did not pay attention how fast she downed the alleged wine. She had a lot of it, that’s for sure.

Maura groaned and tried to get up, but managed to get tangled, flipped and was unsafely and loudly delivered to the ground by the hammock she slept in. Fuck, she slept in the damn hammock. Why the fuck did she sleep in the god damn hammock?

“Maggie!!!” Maura screamed. She was fuming and absolutely done with this shit. She couldn’t understand how any normal, self-respecting person would live in the woods for a couple of days, sleep on the ground (in her case the fucking hammock), shit in the woods, eat over a campfire, get bitten by fucking mosquitos, and God knows what other blood sucking asshole creature out there. But then, go back to their normal lives and act like they were just in Shangri La and had a vision about the meaning of life. She was done. She wanted out of this Nirvana bullshit. Unicorns and crap or whatever the fuck it was.

“Maggie!!! You bitch! Get your ass up. We need to go.” Where the fuck was she. She just now realized that Maggie’s tent was gone. Where the fuck, did she go? She couldn’t have left without her or without her noticing. It wouldn’t be the first time Maggie ditched because she had the attention span of a Golden Retriever and honestly Maura wouldn’t be surprised if she saw a squirl and chased after it. Maura swore Maggie was just perpetually high on positive thoughts and vibes. Maura sighed and looked around. No tent, no gear, no Maggie. Fucking bitch! She left her, again.

“What?!Why are you screaming?” Maggie emerged from the nearby bushes still rubbing her eyes and stumbling between the trees. Maggie looked like she had just woken up. Maggie generally appeared very fit and angelic, with a permanent smile on her face and somewhat annoyingly peaceful look on her face. All the time! Morra had no idea how anyone could be so calm all the fucking time.

“Where the hell did you come from? Where is the tent? Where is all of our shit? I thought you left me, again.” Maura spat out.

“What do you mean? Everything is still over there, at the campsite. And what do you mean by “left” you again? I’ve never left you before.” Maggie replied, now a bit more aware but still confused on why her friend was so panicked and frantic.

“Maggie, you’ve ditched me more times than I can count. Usually because you see something shiny or super fucking awesome and lose all awareness for reality and go guns blazing for the next big adventure. That time when you left me two towns over because you saw someone you thought you knew driving a car someone else you knew drove and you thought it was as sign from God or something.”

“Well, for the record, I thought the car maybe stolen because it matched the description of the one from the report we heard on the radio. And I didn’t ditch you. I said I’ll be right back” Maggie stated as a matter of factly.

“Maggie, you came back three hour later, and only because I called you from the local diner. You were my ride!” Maura yelled at her.

“God, you’re so neurotic, Maura. You really need to try and relax. It’s not that big of a deal” Maggie dismissed her with an eye roll and wave of her hand.

“How about the time we’re on a double date with a guy you really liked? Or should I say when I tagged along because you really liked some idiot, and he wanted to bring his friend along. You split and left me with someone duller than a pencil eraser.” Maura was getting really annoyed and especially by her friend’s calm demeanor. Fuck, that really pissed her off.

“I told you we’re going for a walk, and we’ll be back. If it makes you feel better, he wasn’t any sharper. He didn’t even know what hiking means. He thought I wanted to sleep with him when I asked him if he wanted to go for a hike sometime.”

“Whatever. Why the fuck is my hammock here? Did you move the tent, last night?” Maura was looking for an explanation for what the actual fuck happened the night before and what god forsaken crap did she drink.

“No, you moved the hammock after you got drunk. If I remember correctly, you drank most of the wine, try to dance around the fire, but ended up burning your pants, then you fell in the actual fire when you tried to pee in it, got really pissed, stormed off cursing and yelling something about and I quote “Wood gods and their fucking spawn” end of quote.” Maggie started giggling as she replayed the events of last night. “You refused to sleep close to the fire after that and dragged the hammock away. I’m surprised you managed to get it set up by yourself.”

Maura’s eyes were bulging out. There is no fucking way in hell she did any of that. No fucking way. Nope! Nope! Absolutely fucking no way! She was unhinged, neurotic and generally very irritable person but there is no way she did any of this and not remember. Not remembering is what drove her insane. It really was annoying.

“I don’t fucking dance around fires, Maggie. I just don’t. No matter how drunk I get, I don’t do crap like that”

“Well, you did last night. I thought you were just getting some much-needed relaxation and enjoying yourself, but then the fire did something unspeakable to you, apparently and you lost it, again.” Maggie emphasized on “unspeakable” by making air quotations with her hands.

Oh, shit. Now Maura was starting to remember. That’s when Maggie fell over, that’s why she was laughing so hard that she fell over. It wasn’t a marshmallow on fire, it was her pants, and she had taken them off and threw them across the campsite.

“Maggie, what was in the wine you brought? Did you spike it?” Maura asked with accusation and suspicion.

“Oh, no. God, no. It’s Papa’s home-made wine. His special. It’s good stuff.” Maggie grinned and lit up as if the wine was the elixir of life or something.

“It’s something all right.” Morra replied with a deflated and defeated tone.

Fuck, that wine was something and she had tried it before. It was strong and flavorful, but she had never had more than a glass. It was way strong. As a matter of fact, she had never seen anyone, but Maggie’s grandparents and parents drank more than a glass. They drank it like water and didn’t seem to have any serious effects on them. She had thought it was just high tolerance or years of practice. The wine was made by family only for family and close friends’ consumption.

“Can we go home? I’m tired, need a fucking shower and I’m done with this green Nirvana crap.” Maura was pulling her whiny voice and was getting impatient. She really needed to get home and pretend the world did not exist, at least her neighbors and her ex who was about to crash into the scene of her chaotic, civilized, nerve-wracking everyday life. He was the reason she came with Maggie on this picknick on steroids trip. Fucking asshole. She would test the laws of physics with his asshole any day. Hell, she would test her entire pharmacology and toxicology training on him. Idiot. Fuck, she would test her entire medical degree and training on him. He was a major league douche bag, and she could not believe she spent six months with the prick. He was someone that made her homicidal. They are exes for a reason. But with Mr. Can-Do-No-Wrong the reasons were more like a collection of Greek Odysseys. They are many and at the end you’re the one left questioning reality and asking yourself what the fuck happened. Was this as obviously dumb as I thought and how did I not see it the first time. What the actual fuck did I subject myself to and why. Yep, Greek philosophy is worse. These are the mega, super-duper, extra fucked up exes. Just skip it. They will spin tales for days and it will always be you with your mouth hanging open and trying to compute",0,1749417506.0,shortstories,2,0.5,False
1l6n6aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1l6n6aj/furniture_requirements/,Furniture requirements?,"Hi,

  
So recently I set up my own business designing and making furniture. Up until now I have been doing a variety of work but I would like to focus more on making furniture only. 

  
It would be all solid wood, proper joints, high quality but with a balance of not being too dear. My approx prices would be €1000 for average coffee table, €1500 for average dining table, chairs €500 just to give an example. 

  
When you are looking for furniture, what makes you buy it? 

  
One one hand I could lean into higher quality, durable, better value, or I could be promoting this as something more like ""made with soul and passion by the craftsman"" etc. 

  
I'm just trying to get peoples thoughts or opinions or something you wanted but couldn't find.

  
Any thoughts, ideas etc appreciated

1l6n4e0,https://i.redd.it/2ua9hjcwrr5f1.jpeg,"Honeymoon Nightmare: Raja Murdered, Sonam Missing in Meghalaya (May 2025)","Hey r/mystery, I stumled across this case from India that’s got me hooked and creeped out. It’s not getting much global buzz, but it’s so weird and sad I had to share. A newlywed couple, Raja and Sonam Raghuvanshi, vanished on their honeymoon in Meghalaya, a hilly state in northeast India. One’s dead, the other’s still missing, and the details are so sparse it’s like a puzzle with half the pieces gone. I’m laying out the facts, no theories, just what’s known. If you’ve got thoughts or extra info, I’d love to hear em.

Raja Raghuvanshi, 29, and Sonam, 24, were from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. They got married May 11, 2025, in what family called an “arranged marriage of their own will.” On May 20, they left for their honeymoon in Meghalaya, a place known for waterfalls and root bridges. They stayed in Shillong, then checked into a homestay in Nongriat village, East Khasi Hills, on May 22. CCTV from a Shillong hotel that day shows them acting normal, carrying a white suitcase. On May 23, they checked out of the Nongriat homestay, rented a scooter, and headed toward Wei Sawdong Falls, a tough trek through dense forest. Sonam sent an audio message to Raja’s mom that morning, sounding out of breath, saying they were hiking to a waterfall.

That’s the last anyone heard from them. Both their phones went offline that afternoon, last pinging near the Double Decker Living Root Bridge or Wei Sawdong area in Sohra (Cherrapunji). The scooter was found abandoned in Sohrarim, about 20 km away, on May 24. No one saw them at the falls, but a tourist guide later said he saw them with three Hindi-speaking men that day. Sonam was trailing behind, and the men weren’t locals. That’s the only witness account so far.

On June 2, Raja’s body was found in a 300-foot gorge near Wei Sawdong Falls. Police confirmed it was him by a “Raja” tattoo on his right hand. He was hacked to death with a machete, which was found nearby, described as brand new. His gold chain, ring, and wallet were missing, hinting at robbery. Near the body, police found a woman’s white shirt, a smartwatch, a broken phone screen, and some Pentra 40 tablets. No sign of Sonam. Her black raincoat, possibly with blood stains, turned up in Mawkma village, but that’s it.

As of today, June 8, Sonam’s still missing. The National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force, police, mountaineers, drones, and sniffer dogs are searching the gorge and forests, but heavy rain and low visibilty are making it hard. Sonam’s bag and phone haven’t been found. The family thinks she was kidnapped, maybe trafficked across the Bangladesh border, and they’re pushing for a CBI probe, saying local police are too slow. Posters at Raja’s funeral said “I did not die, I was killed.” A Special Investigation Team is working the case, but no arrests yet.

Other details: no CCTV at the Mawlakhiat parking lot where they left the scooter, and no vehicle logs. A female coffee vendor was questioned after a reported dispute with the couple, but police say she’s not a suspect. The guide’s story about the three men is the newest lead, but it’s vague.

Amazingly I can focus and be productive when depressed.

Quit coffee, now im sorta depressed a week later and whatnot BUT I REALIZED

I really need to convert to a religion. Maybe it will cure my depression maybe i'll get some structure to my life(but religion requires community which is also great and the church i go to with my familly I just don't feel it? In my depressive whatever in my head I made myself think I'm slowly draining the life force our of all the congregants and they all hate me cause...cause they can... ? Cause why wouldnt they hate my dumbass.

So I need to go to another religion... and thats going to give me structure somehow fix my life(and i totally wont go back into the same thought patterns)...

Totally won't find a way to blame myself for random little things and elderly people passing cause I drained their energy out of them like a literal energy vampire to somehow keep myself from getting weak and frail... yk sucks getting depressed when you thought your mental health was better. (Oh and the paranoia.. jeez). I keep kinda moving right now like fidgeting today.. not sure why (its cause someone spiked the comunion of course /s but hey now im back to thinking I'm being dosed by religious church goers this time. I don't do any substances so maybe its an expression of 'no way i have mental health issues it must be something sinister"" this is just a vent. . Biding my time listening to sad music in my target language while kinda studying whatever. at least I'm doing something. The music also makes me calm )

Idk what to do about all this... idk what to do about the intrusive thoughts that apparently are only a thing when im depressed.

next time i chat with my therapist is in a few months. (mmm idk. Im taking a break from classes. its fine if i spend the summer depressed vs whatever tf i was feeling prior which was worse cause i failed classes while having my whole sense of self worse being based on my performance in college.)

(i used to be in a religious group that was kinda culty. Told to only be friends with Christians, everyone went to the same Christian college, leaving the faith was the worst thing you could do and i didnt know anyone non Christian in person cause i wasnt suppsoed to be close to the sinful non-Christian world controlled by Satan. Thankfully I drifted far from it over time mostly(didnt go to the Christian college, wasnt able to be friends with the people there, lost contact with them all)

  
...ever get depressed and paranoid others are trying to set you up somehow? Like this is all just a ploy to ruin my (non existent? reputation and job chances going foward.... everyones kinda acting like the opposite so i wont catch on yk? ik thats very paranoid but still. keep going back to it.)",1,1749416893.0,depression,0,1.0,False

# Context / Pain

Every time I add Gmail, Slack, or HubSpot to a SaaS project I burn \~40 engineer-hours on:

* OAuth quirks (Google vs. Microsoft vs. Slack)
* Token rotation & encrypted storage
* Rate-limits that explode silently
* Mapping totally different JSON shapes into one backend model

It’s the same plumbing on repeat, and it slows new features to a crawl.

# What I’m building (early prototype)

ConnectX =

1. 2-line embeddable widget that runs the whole OAuth flow for multiple providers
2. One unified API (/send, /read) no matter which channel
3. Optional AI helpers (draft email replies, summarize Slack threads) you can toggle on/off

All server-side security (AES-256 + KMS) and rate-limit retries are baked in; you just call a single endpoint.

# Why I’m posting

I’m still in the basement phase—no landing page, no demo video, just code and coffee.  
I’d love blunt answers to these:

* Does this scratch a real itch for you or your team?
* Which provider(s) would have to be supported on day one?
* Would “unified plus AI” matter, or is OAuth-as-a-service alone compelling?
* What would make you not trust a small startup to hold tokens, and how could that trust be earned?

I’ll be in the thread all day—tear it apart, ask anything, or share your own horror stories.

Chapter 1 

The dry heat wafts Nova’s lightly perspired body as she exits the gym, after a morning workout. 

“Ugh. Summer’s definitely here,” she muttered, her sultry Southern drawl curling around the words like honey on heat.

Her town is progressive, but built next to a desert - a bustling, modern hub of professionals. Freshly designed condominiums lined the traffic-filled downtown streets. The dry climate paid no mind to such amenities, however. 
Nova paused, and checked her smart watch.

“Perfect, an easy 500 calories burned”, she thought, as she set course for her normal post-work out coffee shop. Her mission: Organize her week while supplementing that endorphin rush with a Matcha latte.  

She sighs to herself. This town isn’t her first choice. She prefers cow pasture and wild flowers. But - it is easier to film and create content for her subscribers here with quick access to her management team. Especially since her content tends to lean heavily into the sensual. She passes professionals in crisp business suits, and ranch hands sporting handle-bar mustaches alike on this light jog to her caffeine oasis. 

Nova is, perhaps, a candidate for the next Wonder Woman movie. At 5 feet 6 inches tall, she strides proud of her feminine muscularity - turning curious heads, of all genders, that no doubt notice her tanned, carved quadriceps bracing impact with each step and plump, built glutes stuffed into spandex gym shorts. Her beautifully enhanced breasts stretch a sports bra that’s a bit too small, and perhaps, a bit too thin - it certainly isn’t cold out. Her silky almond hair, streaked with blonde, bounced rhythmically in a top bun. 

Nova liked the eyes on her - it always felt new; the steady supply of available influence she could access brings confidence, and a feeling of control. Something she desperately lacked in her last relationship. How could she give a man everything, and walk away with less than nothing? Nova sighed, and shouldered a door with a small bell bolted into a top corner; walking into a new world of crisp, conditioned air swirling with notes of sugar and roasted coffee beans, firing off tiny sparks of joy in her brain. She had arrived at her destination. 

She didn’t notice Roman at first - which was odd, looking back, she thought. His immense size would be the first thing anyone would notice. Standing tall at 6 feet, 3 inches, he had a back as wide as a dinner table that made him seem almost as wide as he was tall. As Nova was leaving the cashier, she noticed his hazel eyes in a cozy corner, nose buried in a book. A scowl across his brow, as if he were deep in thought. She felt the first tug at her heart when she noticed his furry companion resting its snout gently across a knee the size of a boulder. 

Re-focusing on her mission, she found the only empty spot in the shop - a few tables down from Roman. She adjusted her bun, sipped her Matcha, cracked open the notes app on her phone, and began furiously writing down ideas for spicy content. The sun’s rays beamed through the shop’s windows with only a few hours till noon now, heating the place in certain, specific spots -  including Nova’s table.  Naturally, after a jog and workout, the focused heat only served to frustrate Nova. Grabbing her latte and phone, Nova adjusted another table over, closer to Roman.
The electric caffeine started to warm Nova’s synapses as she found a state of flow in her work. Suddenly, she felt a gentle wetness touch her outer thigh, just above the knee. Roman’s dog had decided to introduce herself. Ah! So sweet, thought Nova, as she immediately exited her work flow, and awarded pets to the pup. The curious titan in the corner seemingly did not notice his canine companion had ventured to make friends, his thoughts still deep in a book barely visible over his large, expansive hand. 

“Is this your sweet girl?”, Nova courageously asked Roman. 

Earth’s planetary rotation seemed to grind to a halt as Nova was pierced with Roman’s heroic hazel gaze. Those eyes carried kindness, and something that resembled immense resolve. Nova’s heart dropped through the floor like a wrecking ball, as a soft, almost goofy, smile tugged across Roman’s face. He said with a chuckle, “Why yes, she is. Although, I belong to her more than she belongs to me. I don’t make the rules - apparently, she does.” 

As Roman stood to collect his pup, the space around them seemed to bow, “I am Roman”, his voice reverberated with clean, authoritative baritone. 

Nova said, her voice a bit shaky, “..Hi, I’m Nova”, averting her eyes - in a feminine side glance - away from his. Her heart pounded. 

Roman’s kingly beard was neatly trimmed—reds, blonds, almonds, and grays blended into a tight square, as if carved onto his broad face. Shoulders coiled with strength and breadth, rivaling Atlas—the Titan who held up the sky. Or - as Nova would come to wonder - shoulders that could perhaps protect her broken, misunderstood heart.

As they began to converse in small, pleasantries - Nova’s curiosity deepened. Her thoughts scrambled to find their place: 

“Where does his presence come from?”
“I don’t understand the way he makes me feel. I’ve only just met him.” 
“Oh, his tattoos…am I wet?”

Roman spoke slowly, with intention—every word chosen, placed. Nova, by contrast, spoke quickly, over-explaining with nervous energy, adjusting her bun every few minutes as if it grounded her in the moment. 

“I am in town for a few more days, we should grab lunch?” said Roman, his voice arching up, as if to pose the possibility to Nova. 

“I’d love to, but only if Tiffany comes too…” Nova said half-jokingly, since Roman’s dog, Tiffany, has yet to leave her side. 

“A pet-friendly lunch it is then.” said Roman, holding Nova’s gaze as if he were protecting its’ space so that she may let him in one day. He passes her his cell phone, with a blank contact form open, ready for her permission and input. 

When Nova says goodbye, time begins again as she turns her gaze back to her notes app. Moments pass. She stares blankly at her phone. Her breathing returns. She unclenched her teeth. 

“Who is this man?”

Just came back from a 7 night stay at Aulani as a DVD member who owns there.  It's bad.  Really really bad.  And maybe I didn't notice this in the past and dismissed others for their complaints, rush to judgment or extremely high standards but I know now that the resort is basically designed for those who have never been and have no intention of returning.  This resort is designed for the one and done.  I even made my grievances known at both the resort and after during a survey.  We had a great trip and the reason for that is that we didn't stay on property the whole time.  We had a car rental and we drove all over the island visiting landmarks and such.  

The resort is tired and old.  We can start with the room.  I made a request for a specific floor and room that were not accommodated despite my request being 11 months in advance.  We booked a 1 bedroom with a full living room and kitchen. The room furniture had holes in the backs of the rattan chairs.  How embarrassing to have that.  The garbage disposal didn't work.  Coffee maker kept giving me an error message and the toaster was never cleaned from the last guests.  I had to rewash all the dishes.  And since we're DVC; Disney seems to be under the impression that we have to clean our own rooms despite the massive amount of money paid in dues annually.  They didn't have a single cleaning product in the room including a mop, broom or vacuum.  The furniture was dusty, scratched and nicked.  The view was awful.  And I constantly had to ask for towels since they don't supply you with enough for a family of 4 that's staying there. 

Now the ""amenities"".  Pools were dirty and over crowded.  There was never a free pool chair available unless you're up before the birds to reserve a pool chair.  Their policy is a joke and not allowing a max number of chairs to be reserved per party is ridiculous.  So many large families of 12 and more had taken up rows of chairs.  And 90% of the time there were only towels on those chairs with no one sitting in them.  Then there's of course the hot tubs that were over run with kids.  No one was monitoring anything and that includes the lifeguards.  The floors were very slippery around the entire grounds area with no one there to help mop up the grounds.  Their choice of rocks for the flooring was terrible.  We tried to rent beach toys and boogey boards but they were always out.  I looked around the beach and saw massive amounts of both items just sitting unused.  There should be time limits and the cast members should walk around collecting unused items.  The lazy river made the entire experience absolutely horrible.  Allowing kids to swim in the river makes relaxing impossible.  All the people and kids in particular that would go in with a tube and leave them there.  So if you're going in with the intention to relax, that's not an option.  You may not find a tube going in but if you walk into the lazy river for 10 minutes then you will find the tubes floating there unused.  

I tried to book their free activities and nothing was open around the time we were going even though I used their coveted app 45 days in advance. Nothing.  We had done all the other experiences and unfortunately they didn't add anything new and don't give you much in the form of entertainment.  Their character meet and greats are fine but again, they don't announce them until the day of after 9am.  So any plans you have will wait if you're interested in meeting a character.  I couldn't book a spa treatment because they didn't have anything for the times and dates I wanted.  And I kept checking and rechecking.  Nothing.

Their food is nothing to write home about.  About the only thing I look forward to is their poke bowls but they've raised the prices.  They have absolutely no allergy friendly foods that are posted.  You have to ask about everything.  They stop pool side service after 4pm regardless of whether or not there's still people there looking to get the service.  And it's not like you can just walk into Off the Hook and get a table. The waiting is long and if you want just a drink, then good luck.  You're waiting a while until all the other table drink orders are filled first.  I waited about 22 minutes to get 2 drinks from the bar. The quality of service has drastically diminished.  

Their food prices are insane.  $7 for a croissant.  $30+ for a poke bowl.  $9 for fruit.  We ate lunch on our last day there at Off the Hook ( two burger meals, a crab cake sandwich that was under cooked and Mac and cheese for my daughter) and it was $125 not including any gratuity.  This is why I get a room with a full kitchen. Because I spent $300 on groceries and was able to make all 3 of my meals in the room for the entire stay for less than what I would spend on one day dining at Aulani.  

My husband and I have honestly been considering selling the contracts and just booking cash if we plan on coming back to Hawaii.  I would stay at the 4 seasons next door or the Marriott down the way.  

Anyways....if you've experienced the same things recently, then I hope you will agree that the quality is not worth the money.  ",0,1749416425.0,dvcmember,20,0.48,False

1l6mp3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/liulfr/comments/1l6mp3e/6/,6,"Pete adjusted his shirt again, rolling the sleeves to mid forearm, then undoing a second button. That felt weird, a little too casual—though he was assured this would be a casual dinner—and so he unrolled the sleeves and refastened the button. Now the sleeves were all crinkly and he looked weirdly stiff. He undid the button again, then shoved the sleeves up to his elbows.

""Oh, this is fine,"" he muttered.

A cheery knock at the door startled him, and he swore he almost pissed himself. Shaking his head, he turned and went to answer.Mike was lounging just outside, looking resplendent in...

A t-shirt and board shorts.

""Told you it was casual,"" Mike said, eyeing Pete's slacks and nice shirt.

""I... I just figured you meant, like, upscale casual.""

""Ah hell no. I meant, like, relaxed dinner with the family casual.""

""Wait. Are you actually just taking me to dinner with your family or something?""

""Nope. Just a couple people who are like family to me.""

Pete sighed.

""I'll go and change...""

""Nah, man, c'mon. Don't wanna be late. It's casual, sure, but if dinner's served too late, Cat gets grumbly.""

""Cat?"" Pete asked, grabbing his keys and stepping outside.

""Yup. Cat Seas.""

""Wait. Wait, wait. You're friends with Cat Seas?""

Mike shrugged as they walked toward his car.

""Friends, I dunno. We were in that damn movie together last year, along withe her wife. Cat's like my weird, goofy guardian angel or something. Her wife Iris is the one I'm more friends with, but even then it's closer to a mother and son thing.""

""Ah. Well, I mean, I guess this is pretty chill then.""

""Oh, they're super chill. You'll love them. And hell, they know what it is to have people scrutinizing their sexuality. Maybe they can give you some pointers.""

The drive to Iris and Cat's house was surprisingly quiet. Pete was not deeply in the mood for conversation, and Mike did not seem to want to push. There was just the occasional stray comment from either of them plus the soft strains of whatever was playing on the car stereo. Weirdly, this was the most relaxed Pete had felt in weeks. Something about the calm purr of the car, the soft music, and the way Mike tapped his fingers lightly on the wheel now and again was almost trance inducing.

""Hey, man, you take something?""

Pete popped awake suddenly, Mike's hand on his shoulder.

""Hwah?""

""You nodded off so deep I figured you took meds or something. We're here, but if you wanna go back to your place...""

""Nah. Nah, man, I'm fine. The drive was just really relaxing.""

""Well, just call me the Sleepy-Time Chauffeur,"" Mike snorted, then got out of the car.

Shaking himself a little more awake, Pete stretched and popped the door open. He took yet another moment, wondering why he was even here, before slowly getting out and trailing Mike up onto the porch of the unassuming house where he presumed their hosts lived.

""Seriously, dude,"" Mike said, ringing the doorbell, ""if you liked the ride over, you're gonna love the rest of tonight.""

For some unaccountable reason, Pete felt himself blush at the thought of a nebulous ""rest of tonight"" spent with Mike.

""Uh, great,"" he choked out.

The door opened, and Pete was struck with a sense of familiarity at the sight of the woman answering. Granted, he had known who to anticipate thanks to Mike actually finally telling him who they were having dinner with, but this went beyond that.

He remembered the woman who had rushed into the coffee shop as he was leaving a couple of weeks ago. The woman with the two little kids who had ducked into the shop ahead of a wave of paparazzi.

""Oh, Mikey, you made it!""

""Hey, Iris,"" Mike said.

""And this is your friend Pete, right?""

""Uh, colleague, really. Pete Coran, this is Iris Leggett.""

""Pleased to meet you, Ms. Leggett"" Pete said, and shook her hand.

""Likewise. And please, just call me Iris. We're not exactly sticklers for formality in this house.""

Iris waved them in, and Pete found himself staying in step with Mike, nervous and feeling out of his depth.

The house had looked simple, even a little rustic, from the outside. Inside it was cozy, charming, but a bit more grand than Pete might have expected. The entry was narrow, but it opened into a wide space two stories tall with stairs leading to the upper floor dead ahead. The walls were a very pale creamy yellow, and all around there were bits and bobs of art hanging. The ceiling was vaulted, crisscrossed with heavy, honey-golden wood beams.

""Welcome to our humble abode,"" Iris said.  
""I'd give you the five cent tour, but I have to get back to putting the finishing touches on dinner.""

""Need any help?"" Mike asked.

""Oh, you're sweet to ask. Mind setting the table?""

""Got it!""

Mike turned and patted Pete's shoulder.

""Hey, man, why don't you go sit a while, since I know you're sorta worn out? Living room's through those double doors.""

""Uh... I could... Help.""

""Oh, you're a guest,"" Iris said.  
""Go ahead and make yourself comfortable.""

Pete was tempted to question why he should take it easy when Mike was also a guest and was helping out, but then he saw the way Mike went off laughing toward the kitchen with Iris. He heard them bantering and he realized: Mike was more like family here.

That must be nice, being so close to people.

Turning, Pete moved cautiously through the doors to the living room.

This room was more like what Pete had imagined from the outside appearance of the house. Small, neat, full of comfortable-looking furniture and with bookshelves lining most of three walls. There was a floor lamp on in one corner, and it bathed that part of the room in soft, warm light. The gold of the illumination made Pete feel content. Safe, almost. Crossing to a long, deep sofa, he settled down and let himself sink into the forest green cushions. As tired as he was, he felt like he could almost fall asleep again right here. Of course, he would not; might seem rude. No, he would just sit here, waiting, relaxing.

With a little grunt, he adjusted his position, slumping a little, sprawling one arm along the back of the couch. Yes, this was a really great place. Iris seemed nice too.

Just as Pete was thinking he could get used to hanging out here, wondering if maybe he would snag other future dinner invites, something seemed to shift in the atmosphere. Something had changed suddenly, but softly. Looking around, he saw nothing that he had not already noticed except...

Wait, had that door at one end of the sofa been quite so ajar when he walked in? Maybe.

As Pete shifted his position again, something brushed at, then landed firmly on his shoulder. He whipped his head around, eyes going wide before he screamed and desperately dove to the floor.

TIRED DID NOT BEGIN TO EXPLAIN how I felt as I stood at the bar waiting for my order to be filled. My feet were hurting in the stupid ‘uniform’ they provided for me – the cheap, white plastic shoes with the four-inch heels. The tiny, black booty-shorts, which barely covered to the bottom of my butt cheeks, were slowly creeping higher and higher, making me shift on my feet uncomfortably. I glanced at my watch. 10:24p.m.  
  
  Great, only another three and a half hours to go!  
  
  The only good thing about today: tomorrow was Sunday, and I had the night off for a change.  
  
  The door opened and a cool breeze blew through from the foyer, moving around some of the stuffy air in the club. A group of lads stepped in, and I felt the smile creep onto my lips.  
  
  Scratch that, there were two good things about today now. Carson Matthews was here.  
  
  Without my permission, my eyes dragged down his body as he laughed with one of his friends. He looked so incredibly hot tonight in nicely fitted blue jeans and a white short-sleeve shirt, undone teasingly low. It exposed his throat and part of the incredible chest I knew was hidden under the material. Forcing my gaze back to his face, I swallowed the desire rising in my throat. His light-brown hair was styled to perfection, as usual. His face was flawless, his deliciously full lips made my finger long to reach out and trace them. The air left my body in one long, breathy, needy sigh.  
  
  When his head turned in the direction of the bar where I was standing, a sexy little smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.  
  
  “Lover boy’s here,” the bar manager, Jason, teased, pushing the tray of drinks toward me. “Table five.”  
  
  I nodded but didn’t say anything. What was there to say? He knew how I felt about Carson so there was no point in denying it; it was clear on my face, I’d bet. I picked up the tray of drinks and turned to deliver them to the waiting clients, attempting to look sexy as I strutted across the room in my four-inch plastic stilettos. The music started up, the lights went down and the next ‘performer’ stuck her leg out of the curtain. She began teasingly running her hand up the bare skin as the men all started howling and crowding around the stage, waiting for the big reveal.  
  
  That’s right. I work in a strip club. Of course, probably like everyone who did this job, I didn’t want to do it. It was more like I had to. There are things people have to do to avoid sleeping on the streets. Waiting tables in cheap shoes, booty shorts and a figure-hugging vest top is one of those things for me. My job included nightly lap dances to clients and the occasional pole dance on stage, but thankfully, that didn’t happen particularly often. We had proper performers for stage shows. Not many people would request me over someone who looked like a glamour model. Not that I had a horrible figure. In fact, I was happy with my body, but I was real, and most guys didn’t like real. They also didn’t like average size. Instead, the men who came to this club usually abide by the rule ‘the bigger the better’ – hence me waiting tables and barely bringing in enough money to pay the rent, pay for my university fees, and feed the two other people I was responsible for.  
  
  The group of middle-aged, desperate men all rushed toward the stage as ‘Precious’ stepped into the spotlight in her little black, corseted burlesque outfit. She started to shake her booty to the beat of the music, hypnotising the dirty men with ease.  
  
  Hoisting the heavy tray above my head with both hands, I wove through the crowd, trying not to spill the five beers and two whisky shots. I couldn’t afford to spill anything; I had a lot to pay out for this month. Whatever I dropped, spilt, smashed, or even had stolen from my tray was docked from my wages, and let me tell you, drinks were freaking expensive in this place. The order I was carrying probably came close to fifty quid.  
  
  ‘Precious’ dropped to her knees, arse in the air, and started whipping her head around, flicking her hair. In his excitement, one guy surged forward and crashed into me, sending me sprawling to the floor, drinks smashing all over the place. I closed my eyes and yelped as the cheap carpet burnt my hands where I’d put them out to protect myself.  
  
  People jeered around me, laughing and clapping at my stupidity.  
  
  Cringing, I pushed myself up onto my hands and knees, my cheeks flaming with embarrassment. This was a typical moment for me: a sexy girl on stage shaking her thing, and what do I do? I fall and make a complete idiot of myself. I had a sudden urge to pat myself on the back and award myself the medal for being the biggest loser.  
  
  Oh, you are so awesome, Emma!  
  
  Not one person offered to help me up. The balding, beady-eyed man who’d bumped me had skulked off into the crowd – probably so he didn’t have to pay for damages – leaving me to clear up the mess. I sniffed, swallowing my sob as I grabbed the tray and started picking up the bigger bits of broken glass from the floor. Crestfallen, I silently wondered how I was going to pay for the drinks. I needed to pay for my little brother’s school trip this month, £365 to go to freaking Scotland for some weeklong field trip.  
  
  Stupid, stupid Emma!  
  
  Sometimes, I hated my life. I was almost nineteen and had been responsible for my fifteen-year-old brother, Rory, for the past year. As if my life wasn’t already hard enough without having to look after him, too, but in truth, I wouldn’t be able to get through the day without his help, so I couldn’t exactly complain. Rory was a godsend, just a freaking expensive godsend.  
  
  I reached out for a smashed bottle, tossing the glass onto the tray angrily. Just as my hand closed around another piece, someone grabbed my waist, hoisting me up. I squeaked in surprise, panic rising in my chest as I frantically looked around for a bouncer to come and help me; they usually milled around to take care of the girls. The warm hands lifted me to my feet, and a hard chest pressed against my back. Sweet, hot breath blew down my neck, brushing across my almost-exposed chest in my stupid uniform.  
  
  “Tut tut, Em. You should be more careful,” the voice whispered in my ear, sending a little shiver through my body.  
  
  Carson Matthews.  
  
  My face grew hotter as his hand brushed across my stomach, straightening my top for me before he rested his hands on my hips, still standing dangerously close to my back. I could barely breathe. He always caused this reaction in me; he had since the first time I laid eyes on him when I was sixteen. That was on my first shift here at the club, a night which changed my life forever, yet it was just another Saturday night for him.  
  
  I gulped, willing my voice not to betray me. Turning to look at him over my shoulder, I attempted to look seductive even though I had just fallen to the floor like a moron. His pale-blue eyes locked on mine. The sexy little smirk on his lips made my heart flutter erratically.  
  
  So. Damn. Handsome.  
  
  “Thanks for the concern, Mr Matthews. I’m fine, by the way; thanks for asking,” I teased.  
  
  “That you are, Emma. That you are.” He slapped my bum and laughed as I gasped at the slight stinging pain. “Come on, you’re waiting on us tonight.” Grabbin  
g my hand, he lifted it up high, guiding me to do a graceful little turn to face him. His smell filled my lungs – the unmistakeable scent of orange blossom and chocolate, mixed with dirt and car grease.  
  
  So hot! Why does he have to be so hot?  
  
  Wait a second, what did he say? Waiting on him?  
  
  I flicked my eyes over to his six friends; they weren’t sitting in my section tonight. Their waitress was Charlotte, not me. Resisting the urge to pout, I shook my head. “You’re not in my section tonight, baby.”  
  
  He frowned, looking over at the table, clearly bewildered. “I thought you worked tables eighteen to twenty-four?”  
  
  I smiled because he would recall something like that. That was when I noticed he and his friends had sat themselves firmly on twenty, a table which, up until two weeks ago, would have been mine. “We had a little move around. I’m one to six now.” I bit my lip, looking at him apologetically, but he’d probably prefer Charlotte anyway; she was much prettier and flirtier than me.  
  
  “Shit,” he muttered, frowning. Then he gave me a mischievous grin. “Well, just for the night, you can swap back.” He bent down quickly, gripped hold of my waist tightly and threw me over his muscular shoulder, making me whimper in surprise. Laughing, he slapped my bum again, a little lower this time so his hand actually made contact with the skin rather than the material of the ridiculously short shorts. There was a loud smacking sound and a couple of guys near us cheered again, causing me to blush harder and press my face into Carson’s toned back.  
  
  “Put me down!” I ordered breathlessly as he carried me effortlessly across the room toward his table. Catching sight of the tray of broken glass I had just left lying in the middle of the floor, I groaned. “Carson, I need to sort out that mess!”  
  
  Gently shifting me on his shoulder, he altered his course and strutted to the bar instead. “Emma had an accident. Get someone to clear that up, would ya?” he said to Jason, tossing two crisp fifty-pound notes down before turning away, not waiting for an answer. Behind me, Jason laughed as I struggled to get down. Well, struggled wasn’t exactly the right word. Of course, I really didn’t try very hard because this was Carson Matthews, the guy I had been totally and utterly in love with for almost three years. Carson Matthews, the world famous Grand Prix Motorcycle driver and most eligible bachelor in England. No girl in her right mind would seriously want this experience to end.  
  
  As we got to his table, he tugged on my legs, making me slide down his hard body. His arms tightened around my waist, crushing my body against his, our faces were level so my feet dangled a little way off the floor. He smiled his nice smile, the one which made him get the adorable little dimples in his cheeks, and I couldn’t help but smile back at him.  
  
  “Now then, champagne, I think…” he trailed off, setting me gently onto my feet, straightening my top again because it had risen up from being thrown around so much.  
  
  I rolled my eyes and did a little curtsy, forcing a sweet smile. “Anything your heart desires, Mr Matthews,” I replied sarcastically.  
  
  He laughed and reached out, brushing the hair away from my face, pushing it behind my ear. “You’ve had your hair cut since I last saw you,” he mused, playing with my dirty-blonde hair, which now hung in natural, loose curls down to my bra strap instead of my bum. I winced, thinking it probably looked like I’d been dragged through a hedge backwards because of being upside-down.  
  
  I smiled and nodded in confirmation. “Yeah.” My heart sped because he’d noticed even though I hadn’t seen him for close to three weeks. He’d been off being the big-shot celebrity, doing a modelling shoot in LA before kicking butt in all of his races in a bid to get to number one on the leader board. Carson was the hottest driver around at the moment, winning everything. At only twenty-one, he had the whole world watching, captivated, just waiting for the ‘young rookie English driver’ to become this year’s MotoGP champion.  
  
  “It looks good, Em. You look good.” He smiled softly.  
  
  I needed to go; I couldn’t keep standing here having this conversation with him. It was hard when I hadn’t seen him for a while. My resistance to his charm faded the longer I was away from him, and then when I did see him, I could barely control my emotions as everything threatened to burst out of me.  
  
  “Thanks. You do, too.” Wow, that’s the understatement of the century right there! “I’d better go get you some drinks then.” My skin was blazing under the layers of make-up I was wearing as I turned back to the table of his friends. “Right then, boys, what can I get you?” I asked, forcing my work-smile onto my face.  
  
  Carson traced his hand across the small of my back as he slid into an empty seat.  
  
  The boys wanted three bottles of champagne – easy enough to remember. I just prayed I didn’t drop this order, especially not at two hundred quid a bottle.  
  
  I walked to the bar quickly and looked at Jason apologetically. “Sorry. Did someone clear it up, or do you want me to do it?”  
  
  He waved a hand dismissively. “Don’t worry about it, it’s done. Lover boy even covered the cost, so don’t stress about Rory’s trip, okay?” He smiled kindly and I sighed in relief. Jason was a nice guy; he was the son of the owner and someone who I could talk to. We’d always got along well.  
  
  Charlotte trotted over, scowling at me as I went to pick up the tray containing the expensive fizz. “What are you doing? That’s my table!” she growled possessively, grabbing my wrist to stop me from picking up the tray.  
  
  I sighed and instantly released my grip. It was her table and, to be honest, I didn’t really want to see Carson too much tonight. The damn boy literally drove me crazy, and I knew I would be crying myself to sleep tonight because of him.  
  
  She huffed and threw her long, silky brown hair over her shoulder, tugging her top down more than necessary as she plumped up her cleavage. I tried not to roll my eyes. Weren’t girls supposed to have a slight air of mystery about them? She obviously didn’t understand that you didn’t need to show everything to get attention. Wordlessly, she grabbed the tray and slinked her way over to Carson’s table.  
  
  I tried not to watch. I tried really hard not to watch… but I just couldn’t help myself.  
  
  Carson frowned as she put the tray down on his table and threw him a seductive smile. His eyes flicked to me and one eyebrow rose, silently asking why I wasn’t working his table tonight. I shrugged, chewing on my lip. It really wasn’t my call, so he’d just have to do without me for one night.  
  
  I turned back to Jason thinking maybe I could ask to leave early tonight, pretend I was sick or something. I loved seeing Carson, I really did, but it was pure agony most of the time.  
  
  Suddenly, two muscular arms rested on either side of my body, trapping me against the bar as his smell surrounded me, making my scalp prickle. I didn’t move, didn’t speak, just stood there like a statue as he pressed against my back almost possessively.  
  
  “Jason, I want Emma to work my table. Tell the other girl to take a break or something,” Carson insisted, as if he just got to make demands like this. Well, in total honesty, he did. He was one of the most prestigious members of the club, and they did a lot to keep him happy. We had different rules for high-paying celebrities, and they got special treatment.  
  
  Jason shrugged, his eyes darting to me for a split-second. “That’s Charlotte’s section, Mr Matthews. I can’t take a table away from her, she’ll be losing out…” he trailed off, clearly uncomfortable.  
  
  One of Carson’s arms moved off the bar; there was a fumbling near my hip and then he threw a wad of cash. I gulped as I looked at it; it was more money than I earned in a couple weeks. Crisp fifty-pound notes, easily about three hundred pounds’ worth, dismissed, just like that, as if it were nothing. Well, in all honesty, it probably was nothing to him. It must be a great feeling to never have to worry about money. I silently wondered what it was like to never go hungry because you could only afford to buy enough food for two people instead of three or to not have to scrape pennies from the back of the sofa because you were thi  
rty-seven pence short for the electricity bill. I just couldn’t imagine having enough money to throw it away like that. My eyes prickled with tears because it just reminded me how hard my life was. I looked away, willing the tears not to fall. I couldn’t cry here; instead, I’d cry when I was in bed tonight.  
  
  “Now she won’t be losing out,” Carson stated, taking my hand and pulling me toward his table. “I want Emma exclusively tonight. I don’t want to share her with other tables, so take her off the floor, too, okay?” he called to Jason over his shoulder.  
  
  TWO HOURS LATER, they were getting pretty rowdy. They didn’t watch the show at all; only a couple of them even glanced in the direction of the stage. They came here for the privacy, the selective clientele, the expensive champagne, and the ambiance of being in a high-class establishment. Angels Gentlemen’s Club was the best of its type in London.  
  
  After nine bottles of champagne between six of them, they were more than a little tipsy. The more they drank, the flirtier they became. I had always liked waiting on them, though, because none of them ever touched me – unlike some of the drunken clients I had to deal with.  
  
  I’d had two glasses of champagne, so I was a little merry myself. Carson had insisted I sit and have a drink with him. The whole time I had sat there blushing like crazy while he played with my hair, telling me time and time again he liked the cut, that it suited me, how good I looked, and how it felt like he hadn’t seen me in forever. It had felt like forever for me, too. Especially when he was plastered all over the papers, celebrating his victories with beautiful celebrities in LA, sunning himself on a beach with swimwear models, or the worst one, him on a billboard right outside my crappy little flat. Oh, and did I mention it was for Calvin Klein and he was only wearing a pair of white boxers in the photo? Every day, I opened my curtains and was greeted by a ten-foot picture of the guy I was in love with – not good for the soul, that one.  
  
  Carson came to the club once a week at the very least, more if he could. He came every Saturday night for almost three years, missing only when he was out of town. These last three weeks had been like torture.  
  
  He leant in closer to me, his breath blowing down my neck, and I knew what he was going to say before he even opened his mouth. My body was already on high alert waiting for it. As soon as he’d walked through the door tonight I knew this would happen.  
  
  “How about a dance, Em?” he purred.  
  
  I gulped, swallowing my nervousness; I should have been used to doing this by now. In all honesty, I was used to it. Clients weren’t allowed to touch me. I’d done this hundreds of times, to  hundreds of guys, and it had never bothered me. It was just business, a job, something I had to do for money. But for some reason, when I did it for Carson, my whole body vibrated with excitement. It wasn’t a job for me because I liked it way too much.  
  
  I nodded and stood, looking down at his handsome face as my heart started to thump wildly in my chest. He smiled and sat back on the black-velvet seat, spreading his arms along the top of the little sofa. He tipped his head back slightly, just watching me with his full lips parted fractionally.  
  
  I did my usual routine, doing everything he liked, grinding against him, making his breathing accelerate. I traced my hands up my body as I danced in front of him, swaying my hips seductively to the beat of the song, looking at him through my eyelashes. He was clearly enjoying it. His eyes were raking down my body, his hands in tight fists, his hips moving in time with mine, grinding back against me. I could feel how much he was enjoying it – maybe even as much as I was.  
  
  When the song finished I smiled and stopped, but he shook his head. “No, I have three weeks to make up for. Don’t stop. Keep ’em coming,” he instructed, his voice so husky and thick with lust I could barely breathe.  
  
  Smiling, I went in for another song, this time actually straddling him and gripping the front of his shirt as I pressed my forehead to his. My hair fell around our faces like a thick, silky curtain. His head tipped back and his lips brushed mine softly. The familiar feeling of lust sparked inside me at the gentle touch of his mouth on mine.  
  
  I wasn’t allowed to kiss him; it was against the rules for the main room. There were backrooms for that, for girls who wanted to take it that bit further with a client. I’d been in those rooms out the back numerous times over the last three years, at least once a week – well, when he was in town, that is. Only one man got behind my defences. Only one man was allowed to touch me. Only one man was allowed to make me feel like I was in Heaven.  
  
  Carson Matthews.  
  
  His lips found mine again, this time kissing me almost desperately. I kissed him back for a split-second before pulling away. I needed my job and this was against the rules; I couldn’t afford to get the sack. Wordlessly, I motioned my head toward the backrooms, keeping my eyes locked on his. With his breathing ragged, he nodded in agreement. His expression was pure want, pure need, and it made my mouth water.  
  
  Pushing myself off him, I took his hand, tugging him to his feet before leading him through the crowd to the back of the club and the private rooms which awaited us. As soon as the door was closed, his arms wrapped tightly around me, pushing me against the wall as his lips pressed against mine. The kiss was so sweet, so passionate, so tender it made me want to cry.  
  
  His lips travelled down my neck, making me gasp and tip my head back. I hadn’t had sex in three weeks and my goodness, the feelings had been building up inside me. Until that moment, I hadn’t realised how much I needed this to happen.  
  
  “I missed you, Em,” he whispered against my skin.  
  
  I tightened my hand in his light-brown hair. “I missed you, too, Carson.”  
  
  “How have you been? You need anything?” he asked, gently nibbling on my collarbone.  
  
  I gulped, not really knowing how to answer that question. I never wanted anything from him; I never expected anything from him. He had already given me the best thing he could have ever given me… but he didn’t know anything about that.  
  
  “I’m good,” I lied, gasping as his hands slowly roamed my body. He made a muffled reply as he kissed up my neck again, his fingers winding into my hair. “I saw you on TV,” I breathed.  
  
  Oh, God, why am I talking right now? Why can’t I just be quiet and enjoy it?  
  
  He pulled back a little and smiled his cute, dimpled smile. “You did?”  
  
  I nodded and pulled him closer to me again, not wanting any space between us. His hands slipped down to my bum, lifting me gently. Instinctively, my legs wrapped around his waist, clamping myself to him as tightly as I could, locking my ankles behind his back.  
  
  “You won your race in Spain. I saw you on the podium, spraying champagne,” I mumbled, unsure as to why I was still talking to him when all I wanted to do was throw him on the chair and ravage him to within an inch of his life.  
  
  He nodded and brushed my hair off my flushed face, his thumb tracing over my burning cheek. “Yeah. Did you watch the race?”  
  
  I gulped and shook my head. In total honesty, I couldn’t watch it. I hated to see him race; just the thought of him going 200mph and leaning so close to the ground made my blood turn to ice in my veins. I’d tried to watch once, but I was literally screaming at the TV and in the end, I had to turn it off before it gave me a heart attack.  
  
  “I don’t like it,” I admitted.  
  
  He laughed and kissed the tip of my nose, still pressing me against the wall tightly. “You’re so funny sometimes, Em. You could at least take an interest in what I do.” He pouted, faking hurt.  
  
  “Hey, I take an interest! I just don’t like the thought of you driving so freaking fast. And the corners… damn it, Carson, you almost touch the ground you lean over so far. It’s awful. I can’t watch it, baby, I can’t.”  
  
  One of his eyebrows rose. “So, it’s not that you’re bored by it, just that you’re worried about me?” he teased, his hands kneading my thighs as his nose rubbed against mine in a little Eskimo kiss.  
  
  “I’m definitely not bored by the leather jumpsuit you wear.” I giggled sheepishly.  
  
  “Pervert,” he chuckled.  
  
  “Says the guy who’s pinning a lap dancer against the wall,” I shot back, smirking at him. He grinned wickedly and pushed us away from the wall, getting on his knees and laying me on my back on the coffee table instead, pushing the dirty magazines onto the floor. Grabbing my wrists, he held them down either side of my head, pressing his toned body to mine, making my stomach quiver with excitement.  
  
  “Not anymore. Now I’m pinning a lap dancer to the table.” He waggled his eyebrows playfully before bending and touching his lips against mine softly again. His hands slid from their restraining positions on my wrists to my hands instead. He interlaced our fingers, just kissing me passionately. He was always like this: tender, adoring, gentle. It didn’t feel like sex, it felt like he was making love to me. It had always felt the same, like we were connected: one person, one soul, one entity.  
  
  BY THE TIME WE WERE DONE, I was totally breathless and ready for sleep. I closed my eyes and held his sweaty body close to mine, trailing my fingers over the tattoo on his upper back. The guardian angel with its wings spread across his shoulder blades. I loved the design and always prayed it kept him a little safer having that permanently etched onto his skin.  
  
  He was breathing deeply, his face pressed into the crook of my neck, every inch of his body pressed against mine as we lay in a tangled mess of limbs on the floor. He pulled back slightly, kissing my neck just once before sitting up, tugging the condom off and throwing it in the plastic bin. He looked back at me, just staring at my face as if I were the most interesting thing in the world. Reaching out, I traced my finger over the tattoo he had running up the side of his chest in fancy script.  
  
  I smiled at the words; they were so appropriate for Carson. “Are you gonna get more tattoos?” I asked curiously, tracing each one with my finger before moving to the next. He wasn’t covered in them, but he had a few. I touched my favourite one of his, the one on the base of his stomach, well below his navel; you could only see it when he was naked. It was a black and white butterfly, but the outline of the wings was made of beautifully scripted lettering. The intricacy of it awed me every time I saw it. ‘You give me wings and make me fly’ made up the outline of each wing. He also had a poem in Latin written down the inside of his right forearm. His body was breathtaking and incredible, and the art on him just seemed to add to his beauty.  
  
  He shrugged, his eyes not leaving my face. “Maybe, if I think of something I want to get. Why, are they a turn-off or something?” he asked, settling down against my side again, wrapping h  
is arm around me and scooting closer so there wasn’t an inch of space between us.  
  
  I hid my smile and nodded. “Yeah, they’re getting to be a little off-putting,” I lied.  
  
  He laughed. “Then no, I won’t get anymore. Just for you, Em.” Letting out a deep sigh, he kissed my forehead before pushing himself off the floor. He reached down a hand to me and I slipped mine in his, letting him help me to my feet. His eyes wandered my body and suddenly his forehead crinkled with a frown. “Did you lose weight?”  
  
  I gulped. Crap, what am I supposed to say to that? I had lost a little in the last couple weeks. The club had been slow; I couldn’t afford to eat properly for the last few weeks what with my rent going up and now Rory’s trip. I didn’t think anyone would notice four or five pounds, but obviously I was wrong.  
  
  I shrugged, trying to play it cool. “Maybe. I don’t know.”  
  
  His frown deepened as he gripped my hips, turning me to the side as he looked me over, making me cringe under his intense scrutiny. “You did,” he confirmed. “You know, you shouldn’t lose too much. There’s barely anything to you as it is.”  
  
  I smiled at his concern. “Okay, baby, whatever you say.”  
  
  Rolling his eyes, he pulled away from me, gathering up my almost non-existent uniform and passing it to me. I smiled gratefully and shrugged it on, watching as he did the same, pulling on his designer clothes, which probably cost enough to pay my rent for a month.  
  
  Once dressed, he grabbed my shoes and inspected them, wincing. “Don’t these hurt you? They don’t look very comfortable.”  
  
  I laughed and rolled my eyes, taking them from his hands and sitting on the table to put them on. “They’re okay. It’s only a couple of nights a week,” I answered, trying not to show him that, yes, they did in fact feel like they were lined with razorblades as I pushed my feet in.  
  
  “How many days do you work now?”  
  
  I shrugged; I worked as many shifts as I needed to. I didn’t want to do more than just the weekends, but sometimes, if I was having a tough month, then I worked more than that. This week I had worked every night. “Just weekends still,” I lied.  
  
  “How’s uni going?” he asked, crouching down at my feet so he could look at my face as I buckled my shoes.  
  
  “All right, I guess. I’ve got a lot of work at the moment. It’s coming up to end of term, so I get a couple of weeks off which will be good.”  
  
  He nodded, smiling. “Cool.”  
  
  When I was done with my shoes, he pulled me to my feet, grabbing his wallet and counting out a load of notes. I looked away; this was the bit I hated. The payment. When it was happening, I fooled myself into thinking Carson was actually making love to me. I didn’t want payment for it; I wanted him to want me, for me, not just for my body. I would happily give my body to him for free, but if he wanted to give me money then I wasn’t in a position to turn it down. The money I got from Carson went on something else – the most important thing in the world.  
  
  He held out a handful of cash, and I didn’t bother to count it; he knew the prices. He’d had two lap dances and a backroom – for a normal girl they would be charging £200 for that, £50 for each lap dance and then £100 for backroom action. I slid the money into my pocket without looking at him. This was the part which made me feel dirty and a little used. This was the part which broke my heart every time.  
  
  He stepped closer to me, wrapping his arms around my waist, bending his head so I would meet his eyes. “I won’t see you next week; I’m going away again tomorrow. But I’ll see you in two weeks, okay?” he said softly. I nodded, not knowing what else to say. “I’m racing again next Saturday; maybe you could watch me on TV. I’ll wave to you in my leather jumpsuit if you want,” he teased, grinning.  
  
  I giggled despite the pain I was feeling inside. “I might flick the TV on as it finishes, just to see you in the outfit.”  
  
  He smiled and nodded. “Okay, here’s what I’m gonna do. When I win my race they’re gonna interview me after. You tell me a word or phrase and I’ll work it into the interview, just so you know I’m thinking about you.”  
  
  We’d done this once before and I had made it too easy for him last time – he was so in for it now. “How about you have to say two things?” I bartered.  
  
  He rolled his eyes. “You’re getting so demanding, Emma!” he scolded playfully. “What are the two things? It had better not be something like ‘I sleep with little boys’…” He trailed off, clearly worried.  
  
  “No, I’ll make it easier than that. Although, the ‘sleeping with little boys’ one is pretty awesome,” I joked, pretending to consider it. He dug me in the ribs with one finger, making me giggle and pull away from him. “Okay, okay, fine. You have to say Zip-a-dee-do-da, and fried chicken.” I shrugged. That was the best I could come up with at short notice. I was pretty sure I would come up with way better things than that while I was crying in bed tonight.  
  
  He laughed and nodded. “Done and done.” Dipping his head he kissed me softly, pulling me closer to him with one hand gripping the back of my neck, his fingers tangling into my hair as the kiss deepened. He pulled away when I was a little breathless and our eyes locked. Everything seemed to disappear when he looked at me like this; all I could see was him.  
  
  “I’d better get going; it’s almost closing time,” he murmured.  
  
  I nodded, feeling my heart sink because my night with him was over. He turned, opening the door before taking my hand and pulling me close to his back as we walked back to his friends. The club was starting to empty, and I was definitely more than ready to go home now.  
  
  Bradley, one of Carson’s friends, smirked at us as we reached them. “Wow, you two took your sweet time. Making up for three weeks’ worth of pent-up sexual frustration, Carson?”  
  
  Carson frowned, throwing him a death glare before slapping him on the back of the head. “Shut it, dipshit!”  
  
  Pent-up sexual frustration? What was that about? How could he be frustrated? I’d seen him in the newspapers lying on a yacht with a Playboy Bunny and two other girls who were wearing bikinis so small there was barely enough material for you to be able to name the colour of them. There was no way Carson Matthews had been frustrated about anything! I hated to see those pictures of him like that: coming out of a club with a girl draped all over him, him fooling around with girls on a beach, the stupid ‘MotoGP cheer squad’ strutting their little outfits in front of him while he smiles. Those pictures broke my heart a little, but he wasn’t mine to be jealous of. I had no right to feel like this about him. To him, I was just a lap dancer at a club who he liked to screw when he was in town. However, I’d never let myself think about him like that. He would always be my first love.  
  
  “No fighting, boys. You take it outside, or I’ll be forced to kick all your arses,” I joked, collecting their empty glasses and bottles.  
  
  “Em, I’m gonna take off. I’ll see you in a couple of weeks and I’ll make sure to sit in your section next time. Tables one to six, right?” Carson called as I headed to the bar with the empties.  
  
  “Yep. See you then, Mr Matthews,” I confirmed.  
  
  He winked at me and then turned to leave with his friends. Sighing, I watched his back until he was out of sight. Just 2 weeks. 14 days. 336 hours, and then I’ll see him again. It felt like an eternity.  
  
  When the last client left, I pulled on jeans and a hoodie over the top of my uniform, slipped on a pair of worn-out trainers, and then headed out of the club. It was almost two-thirty in the morning now; I had just a fifteen-minute walk to make and then I could crawl into bed and sleep.  
  
  As I walked toward the block of flats I called home, I gripped my pepper spray in my hand, keeping it hidden in my pocket. I was always careful. This wasn’t the nicest part of London, after all. It was stupid for me to be walking the streets at this time of night, but I didn’t have the money for a taxi, so I had no choice.  
  
  Thankfully, the journey was uneventful. By the time I made it up the seven flights of stairs and stopped outside my front door, I was exhaus  
ted.  
  
  I sighed and headed inside, making sure to secure the three locks we had on our door. When we were safely locked in, I sighed and immediately headed to the fridge to see if there was anything in there for me to eat. I hadn’t eaten since breakfast and my stomach hurt. I knew I hadn’t bought anything, but I was hoping something would magically appear in there to make my hunger pains subside.  
  
  Just like I thought, though, the fridge was almost empty. There was a little milk, which would be enough for two bowls of cereal in the morning, a little cheese and about four eggs, which would do for lunch. I spotted half a loaf of bread on the side, and I swore under my breath when I noticed Rory had left the bag open so it would have gone a little stale. I shoved my hand in, squeezing it to see if it could be saved. It was a little firmer than I would have liked, but it was still edible. Sighing, I wrapped it back up before quietly heading into Rory’s room. He was sprawled out on his bed, fully clothed, one arm hanging off onto the floor, snoring, TV still on. I smiled and threw the quilt over him to keep him warm and turned his TV off. Rory was a good kid, a little troubled what with our parents’ strict and mostly-harsh upbringing, but he was still a good kid. As little brothers went, he was the best.  
  
  I snuck out, closing the door silently, heading to my room next. After slipping out of my clothes and pulling on a worn old nightshirt, I shoved my hand into the pocket of my work shorts and pulled out the wad of cash from Carson. It was thick; he’d overpaid.  
  
  I counted it out onto the bedside cabinet. £400. I smiled and closed my eyes, a tear falling down my cheek as relief washed over my body. That would pay for Rory’s trip and would leave some left over, too. Now I could stop worrying so much.  
  
  After taking out forty pounds, I shoved the rest down the back of my chest of drawers, pushing it into the little envelope I’d taped there for cash. I pushed the forty back into my jeans pocket. I could eat tomorrow now, too, thanks to Carson.  
  
  I smiled and headed over to the little cot at the foot of my bed. Leaning my arms on the rails, I looked over the side to see my little girl sleeping peacefully, exactly where I left her before going to work tonight. I smiled when I saw her perfect, angelic face. She was so beautiful, just like her daddy. Her mess of curly, light-brown hair was all strewn out on the pillow; she was hugging her teddy bear tightly in her sleep. Her features were so perfect, just like Carson’s. She had his cute little nose and the same shape to her pretty face. If she opened her eyes it would be like looking.........

I’ve been thinking a lot about how D2C brands could borrow B2B tactics to scale profitably — and here’s one idea I can’t stop thinking about  
  
Why not **partner with large companies** as their exclusive coffee supplier?

Companies like Google have **10,000+ employees**.

You supply coffee for their offices, and place a **QR code** on the packaging or cups — making it easy for employees to reorder for home use.

You get:  
✅ **Upfront cash flow** from the corporate deal  
✅ **Recurring orders** without ad spend  
✅ **Brand exposure** to premium daily users

It’s not entirely new — I know companies like **Zomato** already do this.

Their ex-top sales exec once told me how they **closed Uber** to provide healthy meals to all employees — a win for both sides.

So why don’t more early **D2C brands** try this?

Especially for high-repeat categories like coffee, snacks, or wellness — this could be a **game-changer**.

What’s stopping more brands from doing this?

When she wakes up, it’s like a Disney villain slowly turning into a functional adult. I, on the other hand, am cursed with “morning optimism” and the dangerous belief that I can “do sweet things.”

One Saturday, I decided to make Emma breakfast in bed. I whipped up some very questionable pancakes, burnt one piece of bacon exactly to her taste, and brewed her favorite coffee — the kind that tastes like it wants to fight you.

Now, we were staying at her parents’ house that weekend. Important detail.

So, balancing the tray like a Michelin chef with questionable balance, I quietly sneak into her bedroom. Lights off, curtains drawn. I see a figure lying in bed, hair spread on the pillow just like Emma’s.

I gently sit on the edge, whisper, “Good morning, beautiful,” and say, “I made you breakfast because I love you more than I love not burning myself with grease.”

No response.

So I lean closer, real romantic, and say, “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life waking up next to you.”

Then the figure rolls over and says, “Oh dear… you’re sweet, but I think this is for Emma.”

Well, it was her mother. I had just accidentally proposed to her mom with pancakes and heartfelt whispering.

I made eye contact with her dad in the hallway holding the TV remote like a weapon.

I wanted to die. Or at least yeet myself out the window with the tray.

Eventually, Emma came out laughing so hard she choked on a piece of bacon she didn’t even make. Her mom? Took it like a champ. Still jokes that I’m her “backup fiancé.”

Now every time we visit her parents, I triple-check who's in bed before bringing anyone food.

Also, I’m not allowed to use the phrase “I love waking up next to you” in that house anymore.

1l6mf7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1l6mf7l/all_of_that_build_up_for_nothing/,All of that build up for nothing,"Maybe NSFW??? (brought up intimacy)

I want to come here to vent and maybe talk to people who may have encountered something similar. I was seeing this guy for maybe a month and a half now. We would snap each other everyday so often and just talk about everything and anything. We have gone to a couple of dates. The first date is at a coffee shop where we stayed past closing sitting outside talking and we only left once it started to rain. The second date we got lunch and a couple of drinks before we went to his apartment. The third date we got breakfast and I went to his apartment again. All dates we would talk and laugh so much and just be each other freely. 

The second date showed me he was very respectful and was respectful with touching boundaries but still held me and stuff like that even going as far as kissing my hair as we watched a movie. The third date was a similar thing as well where he would still hold me while also respecting my boundaries. Then I initiated doing the deed with him. It wasn’t anything uncomfortable at all and we were even able to make jokes in the middle of it all. I left his apartment feeling good and happy about our great time together. 

Hours later, I decided to check snapchat and saw that he wasn’t in my chat history anymore. He had blocked me and he even removed me from tinder (where I met him at). I texted his number (he had told me before that he rarely uses his number as he’d rather use snapchat as he uses snapchat to contact his co workers) and asked if he had blocked me from snapchat. No response. I, acting out of emotion and anxiety, had called him twice that night. The first time rang, knowing I wasn’t blocked, and the second time I think also rang but then went to voicemail. I texted him this morning saying if he did block me, it was fucked since I just got intimate with him and asked if he could give the decency to give me closure especially after what we’ve been through. I still have received nothing. 

I have reached out to friends wondering what could have happened and what shifted as nothing from the date showed disinterest or showed that he just wanted to hook up (I personally think no sane person would go through all this effort just to hook up and block the person as soon as you get it). I also think blocking is such a huge action because most guys just ghost but block?? that’s an extreme I rarely see men do. 

I apologize for this large rant but I desperately want to be seen and find if anyone could give me an explanation as to why he would do this? That’s what hurts the most—not having an explanation. If he had been blatantly obvious about just hooking up maybe I wouldn’t be as hurt as I am right now but it’s the fact he built up trust and openness for a month and a half just to be intimate for a short time. 

If you have read this far, thank you. I would love to hear your thoughts even if it’s brutal. I’m very much in a state of confusion and hurt right now.",1,1749415519.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

I felt embarrassed and told myself it was a mistake to have come.

I do my U-turn at 1.6 miles and head back to the coffee shop where it starts and ends, and saw a few people in the group who were returning at the same time. Everyone was all smiles and super supportive - turns out a lot of people didn't do the longer distances and just decided they were going to do their own length and pace. Nobody asked or cared how far or fast I ran, but were super friendly and welcoming. Plus, the coffee shop gave us 20% off, and some free coffee before the run started, too.

1l6mdog,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1l6mdog/the_giver_he_had_seen_it_both_times_squinting/,"The Giver : He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane. At first, he had been.....","It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the opposite direction, the same plane. At first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the community.  But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, looking around anxiously, had seen others—adults as well as children—stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an explanation of the frightening event. Then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest building and stay there. IMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through the speakers had said, LEAVE YOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY ARE.  Instantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the path behind his family's dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed there, alone. His parents were both at work, and his little sister, Lily, was at the Childcare Center where she spent her after-school hours.  
  
  Looking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of the busy afternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, and Food Delivery people who usually populated the community at that time of day. He saw only the abandoned bikes here and there on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly.  
  
  He had been frightened then. The sense of his own community silent, waiting, had made his stomach churn. He had trembled.  
  
  But it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled again, and the voice, reassuring now and less urgent, had explained that a Pilot-in-Training had misread his navigational instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately the Pilot had been trying to make his way back before his error was noticed.  
  
  NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, followed by silence. There was an ironic tone to that final message, as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, though he knew what a grim statement it had been. For a contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of failure.  
  
  Even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. Jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, ""That's it, Asher! You're released!"" when Asher's clumsy error had lost a match for his team. He had been taken aside for a brief and serious talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment, and apologized to Asher after the game.  
  
  Now, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along the river path, he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach-sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. It was not what he was feeling now with December approaching. He searched for the right word to describe his own feeling.  
  
  Jonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases until they were barely recognizable and often very funny.  
  
  Jonas grinned, remembering the morning that Asher had dashed into the classroom, late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle of the chanting of the morning anthem. When the class took their seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn, Asher remained standing to make his public apology as was required.  
  
  ""I apologize for inconveniencing my learning community. "" Asher ran through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his breath. The Instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation. The students had all been grinning, because they had listened to Asher's explanations so many times before.  
  
  ""I left home at the correct time but when I was riding along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. I guess I just got distraught, watching them.  
  
  ""I apologize to my classmates,"" Asher concluded. He smoothed his rumpled tunic and sat down.  
  
  ""We accept your apology, Asher. "" The class recited the standard response in unison. Many of the students were biting their lips to keep from laughing.  
  
  ""I accept your apology, Asher,"" the Instructor said. He was smiling. ""And I thank you, because once again you have provided an opportunity for a lesson in language. 'Distraught' is too strong an adjective to describe salmon-viewing. "" He turned and wrote ""distraught"" on the instructional board. Beside it he wrote ""distracted. ""  
  
  Jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his feelings, now that December was almost here. It was too strong an adjective.  
  
  He had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it was almost upon him, he wasn't frightened, but he was . . . eager, he decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would be coming so soon.  
  
  But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought about it, about what might happen.  
  
  Apprehensive, Jonas decided. That's what I am.  
  
  ""Who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?"" Jonas's father asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal.  
  
  It was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings. Sometimes Jonas and his sister, Lily, argued over turns, over who would get to go first. Their parents, of course, were part of the ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. But like all parents—all adults—they didn't fight and wheedle for their turn.  
  
  Nor did Jonas, tonight. His feelings were too complicated this evening. He wanted to share them, but he wasn't eager to begin the process of sifting through his own complicated emotions, even with the help that he knew his parents could give.  
  
  ""You go, Lily,"" he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger—only a Seven—wiggling with impatience in her chair.  
  
  ""I felt very angry this afternoon,"" Lily announced. ""My Childcare group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, and they didn't obey the rules at all. One of them—a male; I don't know his name—kept going right to the front of the line for the slide, even though the rest of us were all waiting. I felt so angry at him. I made my hand into a fist, like this. "" She held up a clenched fist and the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture.  
  
  ""Why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?"" Mother asked.  
  
  Lily considered, and shook her head. ""I don't know. They acted like . . . like. . . ""  
  
  ""Animals?"" Jonas suggested. He laughed.  
  
  ""That's right,"" Lily said, laughing too. ""Like animals. "" Neither child knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit in.  
  
  ""Where were the visitors from?"" Father asked.  
  
  Lily frowned, trying to remember. ""Our leader told us, when he made the welcome speech, but I can't remember. I guess I wasn't paying attention. It was from another community. They had to leave very early, and they had their midday meal on the bus. ""  
  
  Mother nodded. ""Do you think it's possible that their rules may be different? And so they simply didn't know what your play area rules were?""  
  
  Lily shrugged, and nodde  
d. ""I suppose. ""  
  
  ""You've visited other communities, haven't you?"" Jonas asked. ""My group has, often. ""  
  
  Lily nodded again. ""When we were Sixes, we went and shared a whole school day with a group of Sixes in their community. ""  
  
  ""How did you feel when you were there?""  
  
  Lily frowned. ""I felt strange. Because their methods were different. They were learning usages that my group hadn't learned yet, so we felt stupid. ""  
  
  Father was listening with interest. ""I'm thinking, Lily,"" he said, ""about the boy who didn't obey the rules today. Do you think it's possible that he felt strange and stupid, being in a new place with rules that he didn't know about?""  
  
  Lily pondered that. ""Yes,"" she said, finally. ""I feel a little sorry for him,"" Jonas said, ""even though I don't even know him. I feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels strange and stupid. ""  
  
  ""How do you feel now, Lily?"" Father asked. ""Still angry?""  
  
  ""I guess not,"" Lily decided. ""I guess I feel a little sorry for him. And sorry I made a fist. "" She grinned.  
  
  Jonas smiled back at his sister. Lily's feelings were always straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. He guessed that his own had been, too, when he was a Seven.  
  
  He listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that he'd had that day at work: a concern about one of the newchildren who wasn't doing well. Jonas's father's title was Nurturer. He and the other Nurturers were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every newchild during its earliest life. It was a very important job, Jonas knew, but it wasn't one that interested him much.  
  
  ""What gender is it?"" Lily asked.  
  
  ""Male,"" Father said. ""He's a sweet little male with a lovely disposition. But he isn't growing as fast as he should, and he doesn't sleep soundly. We have him in the extra care section for supplementary nurturing, but the committee's beginning to talk about releasing him. ""  
  
  ""Oh, no,"" Mother murmured sympathetically. ""I know how sad that must make you feel. ""  
  
  Jonas and Lily both nodded sympathetically as well. Release of newchildren was always sad, because they hadn't had a chance to enjoy life within the community yet. And they hadn't done anything wrong.  
  
  There were only two occasions of release which were not punishment. Release of the elderly, which was a time of celebration for a life well and fully lived; and release of a newchild, which always brought a sense of what-could-we-have-done. This was especially troubling for the Nurturers, like Father, who felt they had failed somehow. But it happened very rarely.  
  
  ""Well,"" Father said, ""I'm going to keep trying. I may ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night, if you don't mind. You know what the night-crew Nurturers are like. I think this little guy needs something extra. ""  
  
  ""Of course,"" Mother said, and Jonas and Lily nodded. They had heard Father complain about the night crew before. It was a lesser job, night-crew nurturing, assigned to those who lacked the interest or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours. Most of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity to connect to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit.  
  
  ""Maybe we could even keep him,"" Lily suggested sweetly, trying to look innocent. The look was fake, Jonas knew; they all knew.  
""Lily,"" Mother reminded her, smiling, ""you know the rules. ""  
  
  Two children—one male, one female—to each family unit. It was written very clearly in the rules.  
  
  Lily giggled. ""Well,"" she said, ""I thought maybe just this once. ""  
  
  Next, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of Justice, talked about her feelings. Today a repeat offender had been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his home, his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And even guilt, that she hadnt made a difference in his life.  
  
  ""I feel frightened, too, for him,"" she confessed. ""You know that theres no third chance. The rules say that if theres a third transgression, he simply has to be released. "" Jonas shivered. He knew it happened. There was even a boy in his group of Elevens whose father had been released years before. No one ever mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to imagine.  
  
  Lily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mothers arm.  
  
  From his place at the table, Father reached over and took her hand. Jonas reached for the other.  
  
  One by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, and murmured that she felt soothed.  
  
  The ritual continued. ""Jonas?"" Father asked. ""Youre last, tonight. ""  
  
  Jonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep his feelings hidden. But it was, of course, against the rules.  
  
  ""Im feeling apprehensive,"" he confessed, glad that the appropriate descriptive word had finally come to him.  
  
  ""Why is that, son?"" His father looked concerned.  
  
  ""I know theres really nothing to worry about,"" Jonas explained, ""and that every adult has been through it. I know you have, Father, and you too, Mother. But its the Ceremony that Im apprehensive about. Its almost December. ""  
  
  Lily looked up, her eyes wide. ""The Ceremony of Twelve,"" she whispered in an awed voice. Even the smallest children—Lilys age and younger—knew that it lay in the future for each of them.  
  
  ""Im glad you told us of your feelings,"" Father said.  
  
  ""Lily,"" Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, ""Go on now and get into your nightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk to Jonas for a while. ""  
  
  Lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. ""Privately?"" she asked.  
  
  Mother nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""this talk will be a private one with Jonas. ""  
  
  2  
  
  Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee.  
  
  He waited.  
  
  ""You know,"" his father finally said, ""every December was exciting to me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, Im sure. Each December brings such changes. ""  
  
  Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to When he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lilys earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, the day she was named, the day that she had become a One.  
  
  The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each December, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned One. One at a time—there were always fifty in each years group, if none had been released—they had been brought to the stage by the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their Nurturers.  
  
  ""I enjoy the Naming,"" Jonas said.  
  
  His mother agreed, smiling. ""The year we got Lily, we knew, of course, that wed receive our female, because wed made our application and been approved. But Id been wondering and wondering what her name would be. ""  
  
  ""I could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony,"" Father confided. ""The committee always makes the list in advance, and its right there in the office at the Nurturing Center.  
  
  ""As a matter of fact,"" he went on, ""I feel a little guilty about this. But I did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this years Naming list had been made yet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up number Thirty-six—thats the little guy Ive been concerned about—because it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if I could call him by a name. Just privately, of course, when no one else is around. ""  
  
  ""Did you find it?"" Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didnt seem a terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule at all awed him. He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling.  
  
  His father nodded. ""His name—if he makes it to the Naming without being released, of course—is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him when I feed him every four hours, and during exercise and playtime. If no one can hear me.  
  
  ""I call him Gabe, actually,"" he said, and grinned.  
  
  ""Gabe. "" Jonas tried it out. A good name, he decided.  
  
  Though Jonas had only become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learned her name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how she would fit into their established family unit. He remembered climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his side that year instead of with the Nurturers, since it was the year that he would be given a newchild of his own.  
  
  He remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her arms, while the document was read to the assembled family units. ""Newchild Twenty-three,"" the Namer had read. ""Lily. ""  
  
  He remembered his fathers look of delight, and that his father had whispered, ""Shes one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be the one. "" The crowd had clapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked his sisters name. Lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist. Then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit.  
  
  ""When I was an Eleven,"" his father said now, ""as you are, Jonas, I was very impatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. Its a long two days. I remember that I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but that I didnt pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for my sisters. She became a Nine that year, and got her bicycle. Id been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically I wasnt supposed to. ""  
  
  Jonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very seriously and was almost always broken. The children all received their bicycles at Nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before then. But almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly taught the younger ones. Jonas had been thinking already about teaching Lily.  
  
  There was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at an earlier age. A committee was studying the idea. When something went to a committee for study, the people always joked about it. They said that the committee members would become Elders by the time the rule change was made.  
  
  Rules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very important rule—unlike the one governing the age for bicycles—it would have to go, eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The Receiver was the most important Elder. Jonas had never even seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position of such importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never bother The Receiver with a question about bicycles; they would simply fret and argue about it themselves for years, until the citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study.  
  
  His father continued. ""So I watched and cheered when my sister, Katya, became a Nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her bicycle,"" Father went on. ""Then I didnt pay much attention to the Tens and Elevens. And finally, at the end of the second day, which seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was the Ceremony of Twelve. ""  
  
  Jonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy and quiet boy, for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his group, waiting to be called to the stage. The Ceremony of Twelve was the last of the Ceremonies. The most important. r />  
  ""I remember how proud my parents looked—and my sister, too; even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn came.  
  
  ""But to be honest, Jonas,"" his father said, ""for me there was not the element of suspense that there is with your Ceremony. Because I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment was to be. ""  
  
  Jonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in advance. It was a secret selection, made by the leaders of the community, the Committee of Elders, who took the responsibility so seriously that there were never even any jokes made about Assignments.  
  
  His mother seemed surprised, too. ""How could you have known?"" she asked.  
  
  His father smiled his gentle smile. ""Well, it was clear to me—and my parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them, too—what my aptitude was. I had always loved the newchildren more than anything. When my friends in my age group were holding bicycle races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction sets, or—""  
  
  ""All the things I do with my friends,"" Jonas pointed out, and his mother nodded in agreement.  
  
  ""I always participated, of course, because as children we must experience all of those things. And I studied hard in school, as you do, Jonas. But again and again, during free time, I found myself drawn to the newchildren. I spent almost all of my volunteer hours helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, from their observation. ""  
  
  Jonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the increasing level of observation. In school, at recreation time, and during volunteer hours, he had noticed the Elders watching him and the other Elevens. He had seen them taking notes. He knew, too, that the Elders were meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the other Elevens had had during their years of school.  
  
  ""So I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when my Assignment was announced as Nurturer,"" Father explained.  
  
  ""Did everyone applaud, even though they werent surprised?"" Jonas asked.  
  
  ""Oh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was what I wanted most. I felt very fortunate. "" His father smiled.  
  
  ""Were any of the Elevens disappointed, your year?"" Jonas asked. Unlike his father, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. But he knew that some would disappoint him. Though he respected his fathers work, Nurturer would not be his wish. And he didnt envy Laborers at all.  
  
  His father thought. ""No, I dont think so. Of course the Elders are so careful in their observations and selections. ""  
  
  ""I think its probably the most important job in our community,"" his mother commented.  
  
  ""My friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor,"" Father said, ""but she was thrilled. And lets see, there was Andrei—I remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical things. He spent all the recreation time he could with his construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building sites. The Elders knew that, of course.

After completing *Death to Spies: Moment of Truth*, the next logical step would have been to go for the third game in the series, *Alekhine's Gun*. I had other plans (namely, I'd like to finally go beyond the first mission in *A Plague Tale: Requiem*), but talking with all of you who had played it made me curious enough to give it a try... and here I am!

Now, this game had the misfortune to release ten days before a certain *Hitman* game, and comparisons were unavoidable. From what I've seen, a lot of people who reviewed it didn't realise it was part of the Death to Spies series and I assume even less reviewers have actually played the first two games, because efforts towards fairness are usually made by comparing it to... older Hitman games.

My goal here is to look at it as a continuation of its own series, rather than the Hitman clone it seems to be (and its predecessors started as)

# Skippable Summary of Semyon Strogov's Superb Spy Service

Here's a summary of *Death to Spies* and *Moment of Truth*, the two previous games, in case you need it (feel free to skip that part if you don't): The Death to Spies series can essentially be described as ""Hitman, but WW2"", every level being a flashback to missions carried out by Semyon Strogov, a Soviet spy, both during World War 2 and shortly thereafter

[The Man Outside Of the High Castle](https://preview.redd.it/whzw5zdy1r5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2a068848d8dc5571fd292e43e1934f8bbc43c61)

Realism was an important part of both games: most locations are designed as authentically as possible, in a ""no frills"" way, ammo clips are accurately tracked so that you waste bullets by reloading early, vehicles can be used both to hide bodies and travel through levels faster, you can move at six different speeds from crawling to sneaking to sprinting, military hierarchy and function are taken in account when using disguises, as are the weapons you carry, etc.

Unlike Hitman, where disguises have some overlap and tend to be upgrades, Death to Spies makes more efforts to make you understand a system and find the outfit that will let you perform the action you need to. There isn't really a master disguise that lets you go everywhere. It's less about the individual characters and more about their role within the machine (whether you're infiltrating military outposts near the frontlines, an Allied building where civilians work, or even >!a death camp!<)

# /aʟɛχɪns ɢʌn/

From the get-go, *Alekhine's Gun* sets itself apart, because it wants to tell a story. *Death to Spies* had a framing narrative (Semyon's interrogation by an MGB agent), but there was nothing else connecting the missions. *Moment of Truth* was even worse in that regard because the overarching ""story"" are just someone sifting through Semyon's old reports

[Semyon is ecstatic to visit Switzerland](https://preview.redd.it/lxv59llq9r5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fac33ef425909ce74b751fabf1fb27d251f825f6)

Slight spoilers from now on: *Alekhine's Gun* starts with Semyon befriending an American agent, Vincent Rambaldi, and after a few flashbacks, he's mandated to go to the US to help him fight a conspiracy in late 1963. He goes there with Lieutenant Vera Pavlova. He'll also work with Pearson, another American spy whom he worked with during WW2, although this one is particularly unprofessional. There's also a translator who's good at making coffee, this won't be important later

With many more characters, each of them having an actual role, *Alekhine's Gun* feels a lot more story-driven than its predecessors, and this is something I can appreciate. The voice acting is serviceable, the cutscenes (black and white stills) are a decent, low budget and style-appropriate substitute for animated ones, the music is good. It's no *Goldfinger* but there's some effort to make it feel like you're playing a 60s spy movie

# Chekhov's Mate

...but I lied to you, because the game doesn't actually start with Semyon befriending Vincent. It starts with a flash forward of Vincent committing suicide after he failed to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy, and his wife and only son were abducted and killed. In retrospect, I think the game may have wanted to make you think Semyon had betrayed him as part of a Soviet plot, but there's really nothing to suggests ill intent on Semyon's part, so it falls very flat

The game also attempts a twist at the end, where someone betrayed the team and helped the conspiracy from within. Now, could it be...

* **...Semyon?** Whom always strives for peace and shows genuine respect for his American friend?
* **...Lieutenant Pavlova?** Who enjoys the chance to visit the US and is nothing but friendly to everyone?
* **...Vincent Rambaldi himself?** Who's so shaken by his failure to protect US interests and the life of his President, wife and son that he takes his own life in the very first cutscene?
* **...the translator?** Who makes good coffee?
* **...or Pearson?** Who's been antagonistic and unprofessional since his first appearance, killed a key witness during an interrogation and argued the project was useless and should be stopped?

It's >!Pearson!<

Allow me to equally spoil that >!Plissken!< in MGS2 is actually >!Solid Snake!<, >!Tobias Rieper!< and >!Agent 47!< are the same person in Hitman and >!Sam Fisher!< becomes an agent of Third Echelon in Splinter Cell

[Can you help Detective Strogov find the culprit?](https://preview.redd.it/x2p9dvvizq5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4255495efaa73e5e4fb9b3ed26a8a8b84aa4036b)

Storytelling is a bit of an issue, to put it lightly. The characters are interesting, but the game revealing all of its cards in the first seconds kinda kills any chance it ever had to surprise you. The only reveal left was the head of the conspiracy, whom Semyon recognised but *I* didn't, because he appears only in a single cutscene after you complete the first level and wears a hat to conceal the fact that he's a Walter White lookalike

# Dabbaba

*Alekhine's Gun* is also a marked departure from its predecessors in terms of gameplay, for better *and* for worse

Controls and movements have been simplified, sort of. You can no longer crawl and the drop-down list of options has been changed for contextual action buttons. The tweaks made to the camera mean it's much easier to aim, there's finally controller support and you get a prompt to use cover each time you approach a wall or knee-high obstacle. I faced an issue with running, because the game doesn't tell you how to do it with a controller (turns out you just hold A while moving)

[The King just castled](https://preview.redd.it/y7z9t2oe9r5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=592abdb26642cb6a6092a6abe920cae8d2206ea1)

These changes make Semyon control a little more smoothly, but also remove the precision you had. On several occasions I couldn't get a prompt to appear because a single step was too long to move to where I needed to be to retrieve/activate the item/object I wanted to

The cover mechanic seemed like an idea at first, but there's really no situation where you need it and it makes it harder to figure out what you can interact with, because a prompt to ""Use Cover"" will appear any time you approach a wall, shelf or any large object

At first, I thought the removal of crawling and vehicles was a result of the smaller maps and increase in indoor locations... But actually, some levels are huge and the game would have greatly benefited from keeping both options available, to let you skip long (boring) walks or facilitate playing as a sniper

# Ca▋ablanca

Something I need to say is that the visual upgrades are nice. The lockpicking minigame is my favourite change, it works exactly like its predecessors, but it's 3d, it looks good and it lets you know what tool you're selecting, which makes the process of unlocking doors much more fun (I actually wish the game was a little less generous with keys so that I could use it more often)

[100&#37; accurate to real lockpicking](https://preview.redd.it/mf5kvrt79r5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ff7840465d9f76c13c0b9586da394888e27764d)

With the early 60s context and missions taking place mostly in civilian environments, the game gets to be more colourful and varied than Death to Spies or Moment of Truth (where the occasional mission in Bletchley Park or the German Embassy was a nice change of pace from the drab tones of military camps and war zones). I do wish there was more contrast between the few missions taking place during WW2, because aesthetically it's more *Inglourious Basterds* than *Saving Private Ryan*, but these only make up a tiny portion of the game's level, so it's easy to ignore

[Semyon doesn't understand how the spinning part could ever fit into a French revolver](https://preview.redd.it/s7i8lazrzq5f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eec5ec6977497196bbb401d25d2f04231309dbb)

That said, I do want to talk about the levels themselves. Part of the reason I took the time to explain Death to Spies' unique design philosophy earlier is that *Alekhine's Gun* ditched it almost entirely

Levels still have a system, but it's basically the same in each of them, instead of having specific variants based on the purpose of each location like in the older games. Disguises upgrade pretty much linearly, functioning essentially as key cards that progressively grant you access to the entire level. It's not rare to change outfits only twice: once to get rid of Semyon's civilian clothes, once to gain access everywhere

And the level design doesn't help. Almost all maps can be summed up as a straight line or a circle, with very few obstacles besides acquiring the initial disguise and then the one that lets you access more restricted areas. The only exception I can think of is the >!Police Station!<, the penultimate level, where exploration is rewarded a bit more and disguises actually matter if you want to perform certain actions

Two more factors completely change the dynamic and cheapen the challenge compared to *Death to Spies* or *Moment of Truth*, though:

* **Guards only patrol a small area that they will never leave** unless they hear gunfire, see bodies or are called by nearby friends to investigate. And even then, they won't move far away from their original point and tend to just move around in circles, leaving their original posts unguarded
* **As far as I can tell, there's no site-wide alert system**. Guards will react to loud gunshots, but only within a certain range. They will never sound an alarm and, as long as they didn't see you directly kill one of them, they will just be suspicious of you if you come too close

This means it's extremely easy to exploit guard behaviour and just cause some ruckus in some remote place to get them out of the way, and there's virtually no consequence for just clearing entire areas of any guard. These violent mobsters and trained soldiers just don't have any sense of self-preservation, somehow!

# Pat

So far I've only talked about what the game does with intention, but I left out the bugs and glitches. Sometimes, you'll get a prompt to knock out an enemy, sometimes in the exact same conditions, you won't. Same thing with throwing knives. Sometimes, trying to stab an enemy with a knife will result in a much slower non-lethal takedown, etc.

There are also issues with collisions, where Semyon can easily get stuck inside doors (thankfully, sneaking mode lets you slowly get out of this predicament) and there's one particular level where I learned that you're not meant to cross a river when I tried to come back and was locked out of the level due to invisible walls

[Semyon boldly goes where no man has gone before](https://reddit.com/link/1l6mav4/video/g3q1rqy39r5f1/player)

Even if we pretend these glitches don't exist, *Alekhine's Gun* ended up in a very unfortunate place where it's much less unique than its predecessors and a lot less permissive than the Hitman series. It's not a bad game, per se, but it fails to stand out in any way and ends up feeling very ""mid""

**Would I recommend it, though?** Possibly

There aren't too many Hitman-likes, much less with a WW2/Cold War setting. And even if I personally enjoyed how intense both *Death to Spies* and *Moment of Truth* were, *Alekhine's Gun* is much more accessible

As long as you don't expect anything great, you can have fun with this game, and sometimes that's all you need",2,1749415197.0,stealthgames,0,0.75,False

I was not a coffee drinker until I was 20 years old and living in Italy with a host family.  How could I be impolite and say no to the freshly brewed espresso?  

18 years later I’m a busy dad who has a minimum of 3 cups of coffee a day.  2 before I leave for work and 1 when I get to work. 

It used to be 4 but I got rid of the early afternoon coffee a year or two ago to better optimize sleep.  Maybe I’ll have one on occasion for the business networking “coffee meeting” but that’s once a quarter or so.  

In any event, I am working on optimizing my health.  I’m 38 and whoop says my bio age is 41! 

I’ve been taking Blue print longevity powder every morning for a year.

I hired an online trainer who has me on a workout plan for Monday and Friday when I can squeeze a home gym workout in.

I just bought a walking pad to turn my WFH days from a weakness for step count (4K now) to a strength. I get 7-8k on work from office days and most weekends. 

Office days also involve 2 hours total sitting on a train and getting home after 8 pm.

I haven’t gotten labs in a while but have a physical in August I’m counting down to.  Also working with the trainer to cut some fat ahead of then. 

Diet is otherwise ok, albeit probably subpar for this sub.  Only drink a soda or two a month. I strictly adhere to a “one hot dog a year” rule.

Any advice for cutting the coffee?  Should I try for 1 cup a day and then something like 5 cups a week? 

Work right now is actually not too busy stress wise so this could be a good week to try 1 cup a day.  The habit is just so ingrained in me.

The EO makes rules for other people that the EO doesn't follow. Like working from home or going on very long lunches or leaving the office for an hour or more randomly. Even when the EO isn't in the office the EO is calling in two or three times, emailing, micro managing. I am getting a strong impression the EO is trying to push a bunch of work on to me so the EO doesn't have to do it.

The EO has also told me not to be on my phone, as he/she saw me looking at my phone briefly while I had some down time.

He/she also made a comment about laughing and joking in the office as I get along well with another clerical officer in there.

He/she has said that we won't be doing flexitime, which I thought everyone was entitled to.

Good 'n' Fun P-94188 Triple Flavor Twists caught my attention as a pet owner because, let's face it, finding treats that my dog genuinely enjoys and that also align with health benefits isn't always a walk in the park. Crafted with real beef hide, pork hide, and wrapped in real chicken, this product promised a savory blend of flavors my furry companion would love. Skeptical as I always am with pet treats, I decided to put this versatile chew stick to the test over several weeks. Spoiler alert: my dog may have fallen head over paws for these. 

**Design Focused for Dog-Friendly Fun**  
One of the first things that stood out was how thoughtfully designed these twists are. They’re perfectly sized for a variety of breeds—it’s a ""one size fits all"" kind of approach that works surprisingly well. My dog, a medium-sized Labrador mix, had no trouble gripping these twirls of goodness. The twisted shape isn’t just aesthetic but functional too; it encourages chewing from multiple angles, helping with teeth cleaning and tartar reduction.  

**Check [Good 'n' Fun P-94188 Triple Flavor Twists] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Longevity**  
I'd expected a chewy stick like this to last a few minutes tops, but surprisingly, these chew sticks lasted longer than most other treats we’ve tried before. My dog thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent gnawing away, keeping him engrossed for a solid 20 minutes—long enough for me to savor a coffee break in peace! The sticks aren't flimsy, nor do they break apart too easily. The durability of these twists genuinely offered a nice ""chew-for-the-buck,"" if you will, standing out against many of its competitors whose products fall apart too quickly.  

**Who Benefits Most from These Chew Sticks?**  
With a recommended single chew daily, I can confidently say these are ideal for dogs of any size or breed. Since they’re crafted with high-protein ingredients and are a good option to satisfy chewing urges, they seem great not just as rewards but also for maintaining oral hygiene. My friend’s senior Border Collie took one for a spin and equally found it easy to chew without much strain on his teeth, so age doesn’t seem like a barrier either. 

**Highlights:**  
- Made with real chicken, beef hide, and pork hide for a triple-flavor experience.  
- Promotes healthy teeth by reducing tartar and plaque through natural chewing action.  
- A high-protein treat that's healthy for daily enjoyment.  
- Long-lasting chew experience compared to most alternative sticks.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While these chew sticks quickly became a favorite for my pooch, they aren’t entirely without flaws.  

- Larger dogs might power through these sticks quicker than expected.  
- As they are rawhide-based, they might not suit canines with sensitive digestive systems.  
- The smell, while appetizing for dogs, can be a tad strong for humans in enclosed spaces.  

**Rival Brands in the Market**  
When compared to something like Milk-Bone’s dental chews, I’d say the Good 'n' Fun Triple Flavor Twists triumph in terms of flavor variety. While Milk-Bone focuses more heavily on dental cleaning, Good 'n' Fun combines superior flavor with equally competitive oral benefits. I also tried Purina Busy Bone with my pup—though he enjoyed them, they lacked the multi-flavor punch and texture variety of these twists. However, for pet owners concerned about rawhide, there are grain-free options like Greenies that, although designed differently, may be better suited for dogs with dietary restrictions. 

**True Value Assessment**  
The pricing of Good 'n' Fun Triple Flavor Twists feels spot-on, neither too premium nor cheap, making them an option that balances cost and quality well. Considering the quantity per pack (70 pieces!) and the combination of premium ingredients, the value proposition shines through. These treats remain far more economical than boutique or artisan pet snacks, and the fact they’re long-lasting means you’re not going through them as quickly as you might softer treats. The sturdy design, coupled with the multi-layer flavor factor, makes these worth the investment, in my opinion.

Come on, come on, come on,"" Rory mumbled as she waited for the only traffic light in town to turn green. Just as it did, she sighed with immense relief which ended abruptly when Mrs. Church, Golden, New Hampshire's oldest citizen, took the green light as the signal to walk across the street, using her walker. Her eyes shot to the dimly lit clock on her dashboard and she may have whimpered. She was five minutes late! She could not be five minutes late. Not today. Normally it would just irritate her, but today it felt like it was a matter of life or death. She needed Mrs. Church to haul her ninety-six year old ass across the street before the light turned red. Rory tapped her thumbs against the steering wheel as she stared intently at Mrs. Church in an effort to will the old woman to move quickly. It only seemed to draw Mrs. Church's attention. The older woman stopped right in front of Rory's new, well new to her, Jeep and smiled as she waved to Rory. Fighting back the urge to gesture for the older woman to move her ass, Rory forced a smile and waved back. After a few seconds, Mrs. Church slowly turned back around and raised her walker, set it a few inches in front of her and shuffled. Rory watched as she raised the walker again, gained six more inches and shuffled.  
The light turned red.  She groaned as Mrs. Church turned and sent her another friendly wave. Rory debated getting out of the car and helping her, but she knew that would only encourage Mrs. Church to stop in the middle of the street and brag about her great grandchildren. All thirty-four of them.  
Two red lights and three green lights later, Mrs. Church was safely across the street and Rory was gunning it. Two minutes later she was in front of McGill's main office on Center Street, waiting for a minivan full of kids driven by a woman, who looked like she was going to snap if she heard ""The wheels on the bus goes round and round"" one more time, to pull out of her spot.  
  
  As she waited for the van to pull out, Rory put on her left blinker, officially declaring her claim on the spot while she took the opportunity to calm her breathing. It probably wouldn't look professional to go in there sweating and panting like a woman who needed a coc\*\*ne fix, although she really could go for a large cup of hot cocoa, her one true weakness.  
  
  Hmmm, she really could go for a nice large mug of creamy hot chocolate with a large spoonful of fluff in it. Yummy, maybe after this she could-  
  
  Her thoughts were cut off when she realized that her spot was free and clear. Sighing contently, Rory started to turn into the space when a black pickup truck cut her off and took the spot.  
  
  Rory could only stare for a moment, shocked that someone had ignored the universally agreed upon parking spot rule of the blinker. Perhaps he hadn't seen her blinker?  
  
  All thoughts about this being a simple mistake flew out of her head when he stepped out of the truck. She ground her jaw as she pressed the “down” button for the passenger side window. Once it was down, she politely asked the bane of her existence to move his truck.  
  
  ""Move your ass, O'Neil! That's my spot!""  
  
  The bastard smiled. Smiled!  
  
  ""Oh, is this your spot?"" he asked, feigning innocence, but Rory knew the man was anything but innocent. He was a bad boy, even his looks gave him away, and that damn smile of his let him get away with everything. The life ruining bastard!  
  
  ""Yes!"" she snapped. ""You know damn well that's my spot! Why else would I have been sitting here waiting with my blinker on?""  
  
  He sighed dramatically. ""Yes, I did see that now that you mention it. ""  
  
  ""Then move!"" she said, not caring about playing their usual game of pissing each other off today. She had a huge contract to sign, damn it!  
  
  He nodded as he fixed his tie and leaned into the cab of his truck. Rory tapped her thumbs against the steering wheel once again happy that the man had enough sense to skip the bullshit this morning. Maybe today would be-  
  
  ""I'll move it,"" he said, pausing as he stepped away from his truck with a folder in his hand and shut his door, ""right after my meeting. ""  
  
  Her mouth dropped as the life ruining bastard walked away laughing.  
  
  \* \* \* \*  
  
  ""Ah, good times,"" Connor sighed happily as he stepped into the office. Taunting a woman shouldn't be so much fun, but it was. It always had been where Rory was concerned. Hell, he'd even enjoyed screwing with her back in preschool.  
  
  Sure there were about a dozen other little girls he could have tormented with paint, paste and pushed down into the mud, but why bother when there was always little Rory James around? She was just asking for it with those two little pigtails, tomboy clothes and a little know-it-all attitude. As the school bully, it had been his job to make her life a living hell and he had taken his job quite seriously all those years ago. Hell, he still did.  
  
  There was just something about screwing with her that brought a smile to his face. That was probably why three years ago he bought the run down house right next to hers. Sure there were other fixer-uppers that he could have bought for half the price, but none of them would have provided him with the entertainment of living right next door to Rory.  
  
  He ran a hand over the back of his head, smoothing down his hair as he headed towards the little blushing secretary that was trying to pretend that she wasn't watching his approach.  
  
  ""Good morning, Mary, how are you this morning?"" he asked in his most charming tone.  
  
  She nodded, shyly averting her eyes. ""Mr. McGill will be with you in a few minutes, Mr. O'Neil. Please have a seat and help yourself to some coffee,"" she mumbled quietly while she gestured to the small waiting area with three chairs lined up against the wall and a gourmet coffee table with one of those insanely expensive coffee machines that used mini cups of ground coffee to make single servings.  
  
  Connor winked. ""Thank you. "" He walked over to the waiting area and decided a good cup of coffee would help settle his nerves, not that he doubted that he was getting the job. There was no doubt that he would get it this time. He'd put in the time and had his work to back him up. No one within a hundred miles could match the price. This job was as good as his.He was reaching for a single cup serving of gourmet French vanilla coffee when a single brown serving cup caught his eye. Picking it up, he couldn't help but smile as he held what appeared to be the last serving of gourmet hot chocolate in his hand. Not that he was particularly fond of hot chocolate, he really wasn't, but he knew a certain someone that was.  
  
  A minute later he was sitting down with a cup of frothy hot chocolate in his hand. Not as good as coffee, but not too bad. He placed his folder on the empty chair next to him and sipped his drink while he waited.  
  
  He didn't even bother trying to hide his amusement when Rory half stumbled into the reception area. She quickly made a beeline for Mary's desk, almost falling over seven times in the process. Why she tried to walk in those heels he would never know. She was already tall, taller than most women in town and a good majority of the men at five-ten. He was not one of them since he had a good five inches on her. She really didn't need the heels, but he rather liked what they did for those beautiful tan legs of hers. Although, he would never admit that she looked good, really good, in that little business outfit that accentuated her size D's, and he would bet his life they were D's. He liked the way that the high heels that she clearly didn't know how to walk in, made her legs look even sexier. She was easily the sexiest woman that he’d ever seen.  
  
  He noticed that she wore a little bit of makeup today, interesting. She looked good, but then again, she always looked good. He especially liked her hair, always had, even when it used to be pulled up into pigtails. There was just something about wavy caramel hair with natural golden blonde highlights and those sky blue eyes that drove him nuts.  
  
  Connor watched as Mary informed her that Mr. McGill was running behind and gestured for her to sit in the waiting area. Rory didn't look happy about the wait, but she looked decidedly pissed off seconds later when she spotted him. Her eyes narrowed on him as she walked, stumbled, over to the complimentary table all while glaring at him. He sipped his cocoa, watching as Rory searched for her precious hot chocolate.  
  
  ""Mary, is there any hot chocolate?"" the little addict asked, sounding anxious for a fix.  
  
  ""Sorry, hun, if it's not there, then we don't have it. ""  
  
  Sighing, she nodded and carefully walked the ten steps over to the waiting area only to stop abruptly and glare at him.  
  
  ""Is something wrong, Rory?"" he asked, acting as if he didn't know what had her panties in a twist.  
  
  ""You're sitting in the middle,"" she bit out.  
  
  He made a show of looking down around where he sat and then at each chair beside him. ""Hmm, look at that so I am,"" he said in an amused tone.  
  
  ""Move. "" She gestured impatiently at him.  
  
  Sighing, he took a sip of his cocoa. ""I can't. ""  
  
  ""You can't or you won't?"" she demanded.  
  
  ""Both. ""  
  
  Rory glared at him, then at each empty chair before looking around desperately for another chair. When she couldn't find any means to distance herself from him, which he knew she was dying to do, she sat down as far as she could in the chair to the right of him.  
  
  Sighing loud and long to annoy the shit out of her, he stretched his right arm out and then dropped it along the back of her chair.  
  
  ""Do you mind?"" she asked, looking pointedly at his arm.  
  
  He shook his head. ""No, not really. ""  
  
  She opened her mouth, probably to tell him off for the millionth time, shut it and shook her head, muttering, ""I don't have time for games today. ""  
  
  That was too bad, because he rather enjoyed their little battles. He made a show of sipping his drink. ""Mmmm, that's good cocoa. ""  
  
  Rory first glared at him then at his cup.  
  
  ""You took the last hot cocoa?""  
  
  ""Uh huh,"" he answered, taking another sip.  
  
  She nodded slowly. ""I see. ""  
  
  ""I'm sure you do. ""  
  
  Just as he went to take another sip of that rather creamy cup of hot cocoa that tasted better and better with each passing second, she jabbed him in the side with a finger the same time she made a grab for his cup. He tried to pull the cup away, but she just dug that damn finger harder into his side.  
  
  Shit! That really hurt!  
  
  Deciding that it was better to give up the cocoa than to let her make his eyes tear up, he released the cup. Rory twisted her finger harder into his side, digging deep for good measure before backing off. Glaring at her, he rubbed his side while she happily sipped his cocoa.  
  
  Damn, there were a lot of things in life he regretted and right now showing her that little trick in sixth grade when she wouldn't let him cut her in the lunch line was one of them. He winced as he rubbed the sore spot. Well, it looked like she'd perfected that move.  
  
  ""I spit in that you know,"" he lied.  
  
  She simply shrugged when most women would have probably screeched, gagged, and shoved it back at him. Not Rory James. She made a show of taking a huge sip of the cocoa.  
  
  ""I think I've been immune to your germs since the ninth grade,"" she pointed out, making him smile.  
  
  Ah, good times. For six months he'd found ways to spit in her food and drinks without her or her little band of geeks, nerds, and dorks finding out about it. His friends did their part by distracting her so that he could break into her locker and they also took pictures of the act.  
  
  On her birthday, he placed all those lovely pictures into a small box, gift wrapped it, and placed it inside her locker. Then he leaned against the locker across from hers and waited with all his friends and half the school for her to open it. Everyone watched as she opened her locker, waiting for her reaction. She looked surprised at first to find a present in her locker and of course that look turned to horror as she flipped through the pictures. As hard as she tried she just couldn't hide the little gag sound she made.  
  
  Everyone laughed.  
  
  He remembered standing there, cocky as hell, waiting for her to finally react like a girl and cry. Instead, she calmly put the pictures back in the box, gagged louder, and returned it to her locker. She grabbed the lunch that he and all his friends spit in, hey it was her birthday after all, and walked over to him.  
  
  Instead of crying and screaming at him or even threatening to tell her daddy and her rather large brothers about what he did, she kneed him in the balls. When he was down on the ground she forced half her lunch down his throat while his friends fell over themselves, laughing their asses off, but it had been worth it. Even the month of detention that followed couldn't take away the joy he received from that little prank.  
  
  ""Mr. O'Neil? Miss James? He's ready for you. ""  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Rory sat in the padded chair, trying to hide her annoyance at being seated next to the bastard. She didn't understand why Mr. McGill was handling their bids this way. She'd known a month ago when she placed her bid that Connor was going for the same job. It hadn't been a big deal then, because they usually bid for the same job unless one of them was already busy.  
  
  Usually these things were handled more privately. She couldn't remember ever being in the room with her competition before when the client announced his decision. The only thing she could come up with was that the client was hoping to use their well known animosity towards each other to start a bidding war right here and now.  
  
  It wasn't going to happen. As much as she would love to get her hands on Strawberry Fields Manor, she wasn't about to get into another embarrassing public confrontation with Connor. The one they had last month at the strawberry festival still made her cringe Things probably wouldn't have gotten out of hand if their dates had just stayed out of it, but once Mary Lee decided to get in her face and Jeff took it as his cue to get into Connor's face, things kind of went downhill quickly. Okay, so she may have started trouble when she dumped the bucket of juicy mashed strawberries over Mary Lee's head, but in her defense, she could only hear '”stupid bitch” so many times before she snapped.  
  
  She still didn't understand why the festival committee banned them for a year, especially after they paid for all those strawberries they'd wrecked. At least she was still allowed to have a booth at next year's festival for her business, Shadow Construction. Granted, one of her brothers would have to man the table and that probably wouldn't go too well, but at least her company would be represented during the town's biggest event.  
  
  Connor shifted in his chair next to hers, probably just as nervous as she was. A thought occurred to her, annoying the hell out of her. If he actually went along with this and tried to outbid her, she was going pants his ass on the way out.  
  
  Her lips twitched at the memory of the last time she'd done that. Granted, it had been a week after he did it to her, but at least she hadn't been wearing pink boxers with hearts on them at a bar like a certain someone. It really had brought such joy to her and her brothers' lives as they watched guys hit on Connor all night and send drinks his way. She'd been sixty percent sure that he was going to kill her with his bare hands that night.

1l6m2zb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6m2zb,It’s shaping up quite nicely,"I’ve really been enjoying seeing everyone’s spaces come together, beginners and advanced alike! 

This is my sixth year gardening and my second year in this particular space, in inland Northern CA (Zone 10A).

The way everything is shaping up…colorful, and productive… makes me so happy that I wanted to share. 

I live with a chronic illness that affects my energy, so having this garden just outside my back door, and being able to use a rolling stool when needed, has been a real joy.

I like to interplant and over-plant, and this season it’s really starting to come together. The abundance helps create a microclimate and makes it easier to cope with losses from pests and critters.

Still, when temperatures climb, I’ll throw up a few patio umbrellas and mist the air around to help reduce stress on the plants.

It started last year with 42 square feet of Vego self-watering beds and eight fruit trees in containers.

Since then, with the help if family, it’s grown to 128 square feet of bed space filled with umpteen vegetables, eight blueberry bushes, and five vining berries. 

There are now sixteen fruit trees, including citrus and stone fruits. Each one has garlic, spring onions, oregano, strawberries, basil, and/or different types of mint planted beneath it.

There’s also a small in ground patch of perennials and flowers that I’ve been planting in (last pic). 

I feed the garden regularly using a mix of methods: granulated fertilizers, in-bed worm farms, and compost teas.

The worm farms are buried directly in the beds, which helps keep their temperature more stable year-round…important since it gets quite hot here. 

Every few months, once a bucket is full, I spread the castings—worms and all—into the bed and start the process over.

This year, I’ve been feeling well enough to give everything a weekly-ish aerated compost tea feeding. I brew it with a couple handfuls of worm castings, some activated charcoal, a few cups of water from my whiskey barrel pond, and a few more from my years-old swamp tea…an ongoing, non-aerated infusion of comfrey, borage, yarrow, sunflowers, seaweed, crab shells, coffee grounds, and banana peels that I continually top off. I also add a bit of humic acid and a splash of blackstrap molasses to feed the microbes.

To protect all that microbial life, I run my hose water through an RV filter, which I change out each season.

The blueberries are coming in, I harvested the garlic last week, most of which bulbed up nicely, and we’re eating the last of the lettuces that haven’t bolted yet. 

With any luck, we’ll be swimming in tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, zucchini and peppers soon enough!",16,1749414627.0,containergardening,4,1.0,False

I wrote my first script. 

After turning on the coffee machine, after a few minutes it reminds me that it is on, then reminds me again and finally turns it off.  
  
The problem occurs when I turn it off manually earlier, then it still shouts at me on the speakers to remember that it is on (but its off already)  
  
I wanted to set the conditions between time.delay but when verifying script I only got an error.  
  
Do you have any idea how to solve this?  
Is there any way to cancel automation when i will turn machine manually off?

Thanks for help :)

1l6m070,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiki/comments/1l6m070/exotikon_3_at_the_mayan_in_los_angeles/,Exotikon 3 at The Mayan in Los Angeles,"  Exotikon 3 is happening this weekend and I attended yesterday only.  I had posted here about it beforehand and figured I'd give an experience report.  

  I attended primarily to see The Residents perform (one of my favorite bands), and they were excellent.  I highly recommend a listen if any of you enjoy the avant garde.  When it comes to the ""con"" part of things however, there was absolutely nothing.  No vendors, no special tiki drinks or bartenders, no nothing!  I guess Saturday was performers only and all the vendors/tiki drinks are occuring on day 2.  It is puzzling to me though, I would think that vendors would prefer to be there for both days!  There were drinks served at the venue's bar but it was just a regular overpriced bar.  The bartenders were cool though, they did a great job.  The acts other than the Residents were Creepxotica, who were very good, but way too loud!  For exotica style rock, I felt like it should have been more of a lounge atmosphere, not ear piercing!  I didn't think I would need earplugs!  Bozo the clown was next, which was pretty terrible!  But I did enjoy it, it did that thing where it is so bad it comes back around to being good.  What do clowns have to do with exotica and tiki? Beats me!  Some of the crowd was loudly complaining during the act, which was also hilarious.  

  There was an ""after party"" down the street at Clifton's Republic.  They have a very cool tiki bar call The Pacific Seas on the top floor.  After the music ended at the Mayan, we all hoofed it over there.  The interior was pretty dark, they hadn't turned the lights on yet.  Everyone headed upstairs and packs into this tiki bar.  VIP people were already at tables they had reserved, and getting served by one single bartender.  Who was only doing vip table service.  The rest of the bar?  Unstaffed, no bartenders.  Meanwhile people continued to file in.  We were getting sardined, and no drinks in sight!  People were vocally questioning what is going on.  Me and my friend decided to leave and come back later on, when hopefully the bar would get their act together.  We got a couple drinks at the Wolves down the street, a very cool atmospheric bar by the way.  They made a tequila drink smoked in a decanter that was incredible.

  After enjoying The Wolves, we head back to Clifton's.  We are let in, but told that there is a wait list for the tiki bar (Cliftons is huge and has multiple bars).  We put our names on the list and hit the first floor bar.  Which has only one bartender and a huge line.  Also, they are not offering the tiki drink menu at this bar, which I think was a mistake considering the theme of the event.  Eventually, 2 more bartenders hopped in and I ordered a Mariposa.  I forget what was in it but it was very good.  When I used the restroom I overheard a couple ladies talking about how the staff had given up on the wait list and you can just walk up to the Pacific Seas bar.  So we did just that.  No one stopped us from entering and the bar had cleared out quite a bit from the last time we were up there.  This is a beautiful tiki bar by the way and I do recommend checking it out if you get the chance.  It was really fun to just look around at all the decor.  I had plenty of time to look around because, following the trend, there was only one bartender and a huge line!  I eventually ordered a vesuvius negroni, a rum and coffee/banana liquor based drink, and I have to say it did not taste good at all.  It was extremely bitter and unbalanced.  Maybe I should have gone for something fruitier but I wanted a caffeine pick me up.  The music being dj'd in the tiki bar by Ego Plum was very fun, a mix of exotica and old obscure weird disney tunes.  However, the rest of the venue had typical chill club music playing.  A side note,  it was mentioned on the Exotikon instagram that there would be meet and greets, with whom I do not know but I was hoping for the Residents!  There were zero official meet and greets.  Maybe some of the performers were hanging out casually but I didn't encounter anyone.

  All in all the event felt very messy.  There was not much offered in the way of tiki goodness at the actual event, and Clifton's was woefully unprepared for the after party.  We still had a great time, but it was really in spite of all the poor management on the part of Exotikon.  Sound guy was excellent for The Residents, The Residents were excellent, and all the bartenders were absolute troopers through what must have been a nightmare!  I think anyone going for the tiki element only would have been disappointed, and I think many people were.  Day 2 could be an improvement though.  If anyone goes let me know what you thought!",5,1749414432.0,Tiki,8,0.86,False

We're avid coffee drinkers and  have gone to many roasteries and lovely coffee shops where we've gotten takeaways (one of the best phrases we've learned in Japanese by far LOL), but wondering if it might be useful to use a travel mug on our next trip.

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for a long time. I am not a traveler and a homebody, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. Therefore, I am looking for friends all over the world.

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like to read books and listen to them in audio format. Mostly these are mystical detective stories for children and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and sweet. By the way, I am currently writing a book in the same genre. I also like psychology.  And I like video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I love autumn and winter, although lately I live in a place where there is only summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I am also a bore and sometimes not very talkative. Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, then most likely you will not like to communicate with me, since I can not always answer.

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

P.S. Since the word friendship is not clear to many people, I will clarify that in the community for friendship I am looking for friendship, and not love and its variations.",1,1749414148.0,NewFriendsEverywhere,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Idle Reunion (January 2022)

In January 2022 (3 years back from 2025), the Tapu Sena—comprising Tapu, Goli, Gogi, Sonu, and Pinku—found themselves idly sitting in their college canteen.  A year had passed since their graduation, and despite being ex-students, they were permitted to visit the college once a month for up to ten years post-graduation.  As they sipped their cold coffees, memories of their parents' scoldings and mockery about their unemployment resurfaced. 

Tapu's Flashback: Jethalal, his father, had once said, ""Beta, jis umar ka tu hai, usi umar mein maine Gada Electronics khol li thi. Aur tu ab tak berozgar hai, sirf society mein decoration karta rehta hai."" 

Goli's Flashback: Dr. Hathi scolded him, ""Kha kha ke saand ban gaya hai tu. College khatam hue ek saal ho gaya, phir bhi koi kaam nahi. Tere muh se kabhi neet 'exam' ka naam suna nahi, sirf 'samosa' aur 'kachori' ka naam suna hai."" 

Gogi's Flashback: Sodhi reprimanded him, ""Main tujhe sher puttar samajhta tha, tu to bheegi billi nikla. Itna mehenga mechanical engineering course kiya, aur ab apne baap ke garage mein bhi haath nahi batata."" 

Sonu's Flashback: Bhide expressed his disappointment, ""Main tujhe independent banana chahta tha, tujhe padha likhakar ek successful businesswoman banana chahta tha. Lekin tu to bas Tapu ke aage piche ghoomti rehti hai."" 

Pinku's Flashback: With his real parents being RAW agents on a mission, Taarak Mehta took on the parental role and once told him, ""Beta, agar zindagi mein kuch karna hai, to kuch karna hoga. Sirf Tapu ke saath ghoomne se kuch nahi hoga."" 


These memories weighed heavily on them, highlighting their current state of unemployment and lack of direction. 

Chapter 2: The Mysterious Transaction

Their contemplations were interrupted by the arrival of a large truck near the college canteen.  From it, 4 to 5 young men, around their age, unloaded sacks filled with a white powdery substance.  A mafia-like figure, later identified as Michael, handed over ₹50 lakhs in cash to these men.  The Tapu Sena watched in shock and curiosity. 

Chapter 3: The Proposition

Driven by intrigue, Tapu approached Michael after the truck departed.  Initially, Michael was dismissive and warned them to stay away.  However, upon observing their demeanor and potential, he reconsidered and said, ""Mere saath kaam karoge to lakho mein kamaoge. Chalo mere saath.""  He led them to a secret underground facility. 

Chapter 4: The Hidden Lab

To their astonishment, the underground facility was a massive drug manufacturing lab located beneath their own college.  There, they encountered their former chemistry professor, Mr. Sameer Desai, who was overseeing the operations.  It became evident that the college dean and principal were complicit in this illicit enterprise. 

Chapter 5: The Recruitment

Mr. Desai was initially shocked to see his former students but soon recognized their potential.  He offered them a place in his operation, warning, ""Agar tumne mujhe dhoka diya, to tumhari puri society aur Gada family ko mita dunga.""  The Tapu Sena, feeling cornered yet enticed by the promise of wealth, agreed. 

Chapter 6: The Allure of Wealth

Within the lab, they saw their old college friend, Rocky, now adorned with expensive items—a gold chain worth over ₹5 lakhs, an iPhone, and branded sneakers.  This display of wealth further tempted the Tapu Sena, reinforcing their decision to join the operation. 

Chapter 7: The Shocking Revelation

The most startling discovery was seeing Krishnan Iyer, known in their society as a rocket scientist, working as a key chemist in the drug lab.  Iyer pleaded with them, ""Please, society mein kisi ko mat batana, especially Babita ko. Woh kuch nahi jaanti.""  The Tapu Sena promised to keep his secret. 

Chapter 8: The First Assignment

Mr. Desai entrusted them with five drug smuggling contracts across Mumbai.  Each member was assigned specific roles, and they began their descent into the world of crime. 

Chapter 9: The First Shipment

Their inaugural mission involved transporting a consignment from the lab to a warehouse in Navi Mumbai.  Facing challenges like police checkpoints and rival gang interference, they successfully completed the task, earning Desai's trust. 

Chapter 10: The Second Shipment

The next assignment required them to deliver drugs concealed within electronic items to a tech expo in Bandra.  Utilizing their knowledge and networks, they navigated the complexities and ensured a smooth delivery. 

Chapter 11: The Third Shipment

This mission was more intricate, involving the smuggling of substances through a medical supply chain to a hospital in Andheri.  They had to forge documents and bribe officials, testing their limits and moral boundaries. 

Chapter 12: The Fourth Shipment

Tasked with delivering a large consignment to a nightclub in Colaba, they faced unforeseen challenges, including a sudden police raid.  Quick thinking and improvisation allowed them to evade capture and complete the delivery. 

Chapter 13: The Fifth Shipment

The final assignment was the most perilous—transporting drugs via a private yacht to a client off the coast of Mumbai.  Battling rough seas and potential Coast Guard interception, they managed to fulfill the contract, solidifying their reputation in Desai's eyes. 

Chapter 14: The Transformation

Over the next three years, from 2022 to 2025, the Tapu Sena became deeply entrenched in the drug trade.  Their newfound wealth was evident—they flaunted gold iPhones, Rolex watches, luxury bikes, and frequented upscale cafes.  Tapu even purchased a Mercedes-Benz worth ₹1 crore, surpassing his father's earnings. 

Chapter 15: The Growing Suspicion

Their sudden affluence raised eyebrows in Gokuldham Society.  When questioned, they attributed their wealth to stock market investments and YouTube animated videos and ganes they made for kids ventures.  However, Jethalal, familiar with stock trading knows that a person cannot earn this much from stock trading this quick, found their explanations dubious. 

Chapter 16: The Investigation Begins

Jethalal, teaming up with Popatlal, a seasoned investigative journalist, decided to delve deeper.  They began monitoring the Tapu Sena's activities, gathering evidence to uncover the truth. 

Chapter 17: The Sting Operation

Posing as potential clients, Jethalal and Popatlal infiltrated the drug network.  Through covert recordings and surveillance, they amassed substantial evidence linking the Tapu Sena, Mr. Desai, Michael, and even Iyer to the drug operations. 

Chapter 18: The Exposé

Armed with irrefutable proof, they collaborated with law enforcement to raid the underground lab.  The operation led to the arrest of Mr. Desai, Michael, Iyer, and the Tapu Sena.  The college was shut down, and assets worth ₹1000 crores were seized. 

Chapter 19: The Verdict

In court, Mr. Desai and Michael received life sentences.  Iyer and the Tapu Sena were sentenced to 10 years in prison, given their roles and cooperation during the investigation. 

Pinku parents thought being his real parents but put there first priority as their country and their job as raw agents to support the right always a and because they were true country patriots they supported police and court throughout the case and encouraged them to arrest pinku and give him as severe punishments as possible because they think that these harsh punishments may make pinku realize his mistakes and help him become a better person in life.

Chapter 20: The Return (2035)

After serving their sentences, the Tapu Sena and Iyer returned to Gokuldham Society.  Now in their late 30s and early 50s respectively, they were met with mixed reactions.  Tapu was devastated to learn that his beloved grandfather, Champaklal, had passed away in 2025 by heart attack upon hearing of their crimes. 

Pinku parents also vowed to break all their relation with him and nerve talk to him but seeing pinku really a good human being and ready to work on path of good deeds they ultimately forgave him.

Chapter 21: The Redemption

Each member faced their families, seeking forgiveness.  Jethalal, with tears in his eyes, said, ""Beta, maine tujhe izzat ki roti kamane ko bola tha, haram ke paise ki nahi.""  Babita forgave Iyer, understanding his remorse.  The community, witnessing their genuine repentance, welcomed them back. 

Chapter 22: The New Beginning


The wind felt different in Gokuldham Society now. It wasn’t the breeze of recklessness or luxury, but the silent promise of redemption.

Tapu stood near the society’s main gate at dawn, watching the sunrise alone. He had trimmed his hair, exchanged his designer clothes for a simple kurta, and kept his father’s old, worn-out wristwatch on. The same one Jethalal used to check time with before opening Gada Electronics.

Goli opened a new eatery in the nearby lane—no lavish food, no flashy boards—just “Goli’s Ghar Ka Tiffin.” Every morning, he cooked the meals himself, serving college students who reminded him of simpler times.

Gogi returned to Sodhi Garage, this time as a humble mechanic, taking pride in the grease on his hands. He said to his father one day, “Daddy, main aapka asliyat wala sher puttar banna chahta hoon. Na drugs, na show-off. Sirf imandari.”

Sonu started volunteering at a local NGO, teaching underprivileged girls how to code. She worked alongside Madhavi, and one evening told her, “Aai, Tapu se pyaar karna galat nahi tha. Uske saath galat raste par jaana galat tha. Ab main usse door rehkar uske liye sudharna chahti hoon.”

Pinku opend his own gym near gokuldham vicnity and train people there and inspires and make them fitness enthusiast there,And pinku real parents also supported him in this.

And Iyer—he resumed work in the scientific community, but on paper only. His real work was in anonymity—helping NGOs test chemical compositions of fake medicines being sold in slums. He visited Babita once a month, at a distance, never expecting acceptance, only hoping she was safe.

Jethalal watched Tapu every day from the balcony of Gada House. They didn’t speak much. But one evening, as Tapu returned home sweaty from a full day at a construction site where he now worked, Jethalal walked up to him, placed a hand on his shoulder and said, “Tere haath phir se mehnat ki mehek lekar aaye hain, beta. Yehi to asli daulat hai.”

Tapu didn’t reply. He just hugged his father tightly—for the first time in over a decade.

That night, for the first time in years, there was laughter in Gokuldham Society. Not loud. Not exaggerated. Just real.

And somewhere, from the heavens above, Champaklal looked down silently… and smiled.

                                  The End.

I haven’t been able to find a consistent way to use this little red devil, so just wanted to check if I'm missing something before I give up on it.

When I try to preheat using the plug, I run into two recurring issues: 

1. If I let the arms drop naturally (as suggested by [@DaddyGotCoffee here at 8:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX4uV-pkj0k#t=8m45s)), water inevitably starts spilling out the sides of the basket. 
2. When I lift the arms after preheating, there’s about a 50/50 chance the plug gets dislodged and the entire basket of near-boiling water dumps on the counter. Fun! 

\#1 can be solved easily enough by doing what I’ve seen suggested here: holding the arms down gently during preheat. That generally prevents the side leakage, but it also means using both hands and babysitting the whole preheat, which kind of defeats the purpose. 

\#2 is the real dealbreaker. I’ve tried all the suggestions I’ve seen: easing the piston up slowly, filling to different heights, inserting the piston partway before locking it in, triple-checking the plug seal, tilting the Robot slightly forward when removing, etc. Nothing has worked better than 50/50.

At this point, I might as well go back to my original method: holding an espresso glass filled with boiling water up to the piston for 30 seconds. It’s easier and has zero risk of surprise water spills.

Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone’s cracked the code & also offer warning to anyone thinking this plug will be a quick fix.

PS - This sub has been super helpful for getting up and running with my Robot. I had some messy pulls early on (water leaking out the sides, inconsistent extractions, etc.), but after reading posts here and dialing in my technique, things are now running smoothly.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a quality cologne involves evaluating different factors that contribute to its overall appeal and performance. These include the fragrance notes, longevity, projection, versatility, and the quality of ingredients. Understanding these features can definitely help you choose a cologne that is perfect for you.

**Fragrance Notes:** The fragrance notes of a cologne dictate its overall scent profile. Top notes are the initial scents that you smell upon request, often being fresh, citrusy, or herbal. Middle notes, also known as heart notes, emerge after the top notes fade and form the core of the fragrance, often being floral, spicy, or fruity. Base notes are the final scents that linger on the skin, giving the cologne depth and longevity, often being woody, musky, or ambery.

**Longevity:** Longevity refers to how long the cologne lasts on your skin after application. A cologne with good longevity can last for several hours, while a cologne with poor longevity may fade within an hour or two. The longevity of a cologne depends on several factors, including the concentration of fragrance oils, the quality of ingredients, and your skin type.Eau de Parfum (EDP) typically lasts longer than Eau de toilette (EDT).**Projection (Sillage):** Projection, also known as sillage, refers to how far the cologne scent travels from your body. A cologne with strong projection leaves a noticeable scent trail as you move, while a cologne with weak projection stays close to the skin. Sillage is a measure of how pervasive a scent can become in the surrounding area.

**Versatility:** Versatility refers to how well the cologne suits different occasions and settings. A versatile cologne can be worn for everyday wear, special events, and even in the office. Some colognes are better suited for specific occasions, such as formal events or warmer weather.Choosing a scent appropriate to the context is key.

**Quality of Ingredients:** The quality of ingredients greatly affects the overall scent and longevity of a perfume. High-quality natural ingredients often result in a more complex, nuanced, and long-lasting scent experience. Synthetic ingredients can be used to recreate certain scents or to improve longevity and projection. Though, lower quality ingredients can result in a perfume that smells artificial or fades quickly.key features to consider when selecting a cologne include:

*   Scent Profile (Fragrance Notes)
*   Longevity (How long the scent lasts)
*   Projection (Sillage)
*   Versatility (Suitable for different occasions)
*   Quality of Ingredients

Cologne reacts differently on different people due to individual body chemistry. Consider your skin's pH level, diet, and perspiration rate.
