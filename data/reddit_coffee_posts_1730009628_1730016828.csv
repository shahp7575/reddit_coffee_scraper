I'm a 26-year-old guy, a bit on the shy side when it comes to talking with women, but I’d love to find a chill female companion to hang out with, whether it’s grabbing coffee, trying new restaurants, or just exploring the city. I like night rides and late night movies, and it would be awesome to have some good company along the way. Not looking for anything specific, just open to making new memories and seeing where things go. If you’re down for spontaneous rides or late-night coffee stops, feel free to reach out! 😊",1,1730016612.0,Hyderabaddating,0,1.0,False
1gd658h,https://www.reddit.com/r/noscrapleftbehind/comments/1gd658h/fun_one_for_ya_hard_brownies/,Fun one for ya.... Hard brownies,"I made a double batch of brownies for my church coffee hour this Sunday morning. I used box mix so it couldn't go wrong.. right?? I made them in glass pans, baked them a little longer because they weren't done in the middle yet, then took them out and left them to cool, in the pans, on the stove, and went to bed. 

I thought I knew how to make a frickin brownie by now, but we're always learning....

2am awake because of the baby, check the brownies to cut them into squares, and the whole way around the edges is hard as a rock and crumbles dustily in your mouth. Everything that didn't touch the sides of the pan is perfectly fine so I still have plenty to take in today. Everything that touched the sides of the pan is (maybe) ruined. I stored the crunchy pieces in a baggie. I'm thinking... Break down in a blender and put in ice cream? But we've been trying to cut out the strangle hold ice cream has had on our life, any other ideas? ",1,1730016604.0,noscrapleftbehind,0,1.0,False

I am genuinely conflicted about this and due to toxic work environment, my friend circle has shrunk to the point where I dont think I can get an unbiased opinion.

I am early 30s F, in a close knit group with 4 other coworkers all female. One of them is gay and the other bi (married). We went on a trip and my gay friend seems to develop a crush on me (hugging me out of nowhere and becoming super touchy). I have never considered myself anything but straight and they know it but I did feel attraction for a hot minute. I thought it could be because we were spending so much time together over our travels.

Now. Once vacation was over and we were back to work this friend asked me what if she tells me she is attracted to me. I got flustered and we both brushed it off but she continued to shower me with attention and messaged me basically everyday. Out for dinner and coffee etc. Claims that she cannot get enough of face time. I guess I went along with it because I really enjoyed spending time with her and I wanted to figure out if I am really attracted to her or it's just fleeting.

After about 3 months a switch was flipped. One day she just became distant. Doesn't  look me in the eye nor talk to me the way she usually does. When we are in a group, she acts very normal with other ppl but avoids me. It makes me wary and I started putting some distance then she texted me saying she is going through a weird time and she still loves me (in a non gay way). I found myself crying from that day. I am crying less now. At some point I tried to talk to my other friend about it but she said that our friend is just going through something from work but it's not something I did. And to just leave it.

I guess.. I typed this and kept hesistating whether or not post because deep down I know what I should do but it's really hard when I remember the times we had.

- 28 years old
- average-to-fit body type 
- big fan of concerts, board games, reading, good coffee, and silly posts like this haha
- you'll have to guess the rest!

1gd62mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1gd62mx/why/,Why? ,"I think all of us here, questioned this. We live in a pub/club/party/internet culture.

Just yesterday someone told me that Dating or befriending anyone is very competitive, need to be social(party), dressed up, laugh, couple of touches. Basically told me to sell myself like a poster girl in order to get any company. I replied that I'm an introvert, and i don't like taking pictures then the person said that I'm fucked. 

I agree, if we boil down first meet, it is practically selling. But aren't we selling the wrong things? 

I want a partner to spend my time with, i have lot of hobbies but they are not social ones. I prefer calm and quiet days, something like sitting near the fire, read a book to someone or sit by the window enjoy cup of coffee while cuddling up. 

Just talking, communicating with a person who isn't right for us makes us even more lonelier. 

Like in anime or games, i wanna just drink potion and want the loneliness to be gone. 

There are billions of humans on the Earth but why it hard to find companionship? I hate dating, it feels like I'm grinding the same topic over and over again. I just wanna find a partner and be done with. ",1,1730016267.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

There was one Amir Mahal in Royapettah. I didn't know what it was but but a quick search on Google Maps showed it had public reviews.

In urban square, I saw the Nehru's statue in the parking lot, inaugurated by Rajiv Gandhi and MGR. 

Food - I quite didn't know what to try. I've been to Rathna cafe and I wanted to try some good filter coffee places in Chennai but maps didn't help much!

Could you guys suggest 
1) some historical places I can visit? 
2) modest restaurants that serve good filter coffee and food?

Appreciate your inputs

1gd5z06,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gd5z06/i_20m_am_scared_about_what_the_future_looks_like/,"I 20m am scared about what the future looks like with my 22f girlfriend, am I holding her to too high of standards?","
Hello everyone, I’m a 20m in a relationship with my lovely girlfriend, a 22f, for two years. I love this girl with all my heart and would do anything for her. When I imagine my future, it’s with her; having kids is with her; building a house is with her. 

The problem starts with how I view her in that future. I am a very motivated, high-achieving individual, and when I’m around people, I want them to be that way too. I view her as a great person now, but I would be lying if I said there aren’t things she can work on. And I would be lying if I said there weren’t things I could work on. I try to push her to be the best person she can be, just like I would expect and love when she pushes me to get better. 

The problem arises when I try to help her grow; she refuses to take what I say with any weight. She just brushes it off and forgets about it. This really makes me sad because it feels as though she couldn’t care less about what I have to say. I’ll give some examples. She is always stressed out—like, always—to the point that it literally blinds her from easy solutions. I am the opposite; it takes a lot for me to get worked up. I try to give her tips on not letting small things throw her completely off to the point that she doesn’t get the task done, but she constantly says I don’t understand what it’s like. 

I’m also a very travel-oriented person. I want to see the world and not be cooped up in one place and live and die there. At the beginning of the relationship, she shared those views, but now that we are seriously talking about where to live and buy property, she refuses to be more than 30 minutes away from her parents or live close to mine.

I want to preface this next part by saying I hate arguments. I approach them very monotone and detail-based rather than feeling-based because I honestly believe talking calmly will solve any issues we have, rather than screaming. She does not feel this way. I know this is a male stereotype, but I do feel like in most of our arguments—not all—I tend to be right because I don’t get stressed and emotional, and I can genuinely just look at the situation and analyze it. 

Anytime we get into an argument, she always ends it by saying, “Yep, you got your way again,” which saddens me. With the living location, she put all these rules on where we can live, and I didn’t have a say in that. But those are non-negotiable. The arguments where I always get my way are stupid arguments, like if we can drive 30 minutes in the opposite direction to get coffee from a specific coffee shop rather than the one on the way while we are already late to dinner with my family.

I would also like to point out that I feel she hates my family. I live far away now, and I was back for almost a week. She came to stay with me at my parents’ house, and she kept getting mad about the fact that I didn’t prioritize her because I would go out and talk to my father for an hour before bed. She was with me the whole day and every night and made me cancel plans last minute with my family because she didn’t want to do something with them multiple times. This is not a one-time thing; I have never canceled plans 30 minutes before I’m supposed to be somewhere ever until we started dating. Now, every time we see each other, I have to do it at least once, and it’s not me who wants to cancel, but she makes me make the call and disappoint my family or friends and tell them we are not coming. I can’t tell them it’s because she doesn’t want to go; I have to make something up about why I don’t want to go, or she gets upset with me and says I’m making her look bad to my family or friends.

She also keeps score, which I think is the worst thing for a relationship, and constantly brings up things she did for me to justify why I should call my parents and tell them why “I” don’t want to do something with them. I’m just very frustrated because I see this beautiful future with her—the kids, the house, and the life—but it’s not with the girl I’m dating right now; it’s with the girl I know she can be. But I only get that a small portion of the time.

We were in a really bad place at the start of our relationship and worked through it. I personally made leaps and bounds in my ability to explain what I’m feeling and show affection, and she made leaps and bounds as well. But now we are in this flat area where I feel like I am still pushing for growth on both our ends, and she doesn’t want to change or grow. 

I just want her to be happy. I want her to love life like she does at select times, and I want her to smile more. But I have tried everything to keep her moving forward with me, and all I meet with is pushback and negativity about everything. I think about her attitude toward life, and I very regularly think if I had a daughter with that same outlook, I would be so concerned, sad, and upset, and I’d think I failed her. It feels so wrong to wish that if I had a daughter, I wouldn’t want her to be like my girlfriend, who I view as my forever partner.

I’m at the point where I genuinely think I’m doing something wrong by trying to push her to be her best self. The girl I laugh with at 3:30 a.m. when I wake up to her snoring and laugh so loud she wakes up; the girl I can see looking back at me while our faces are pressed against the glass of the car window. I just want her to keep that attitude and demeanor, but those moments only last a moment, and that scares me. 

In the future, is it going to be more of this revolving door of sadness and anger, or will I ever be able to pull her out of this self-sabotaging behavior she has self-proclaimed is “just how it is”? I don’t believe that’s “just how it is.” I know there can be bright days that outshine dark days because I have gone through it and chosen to focus on the good stuff and not dwell on the bad. I have chosen to use kind words with her over negative ones because I want to work on myself for us. Everything I do is weighed against how it will help us, and it feels like I’m on a one-sided seesaw; I’m trying to jump as hard as I can, but I always get pulled right back down.

I understand this is rambling and probably doesn’t make the most sense. I appreciate any feedback and or tips to help. I truly love her and just want her to be the best she can be but in the end it feels wrong to want her to “change”. ",2,1730015826.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

It all started as soon as I came back from the hospital after birth. He had 1 month of paternity leave but it turned out to be more of a vacation to him than help for me and the family. During my pregnancy he almost quit smoking weed and reduced drinking, it was our plan for him to become less addicted to things which might I fluence his parenthood. Until I gave birth... he started smoking more weed than ever, and going out with friends every week. After many many fights and no results I decided to give it some time as many people say one shouldn't rush with such major decisions in the 1st year.

Well now, 7 months later it's the same. He is outside in the park smoking weed and cigarettes at least for a few hours a day. Or goes cycling for a few hours as well. Sometimes he has an energy burst and cleans a bit at home but on a daily basis not really. He is responsible for the kitchen, but most days he does a half assed job. That leaves me  with even more mess.

This morning for example we both woke up at similar times. I asked him to wash the pan (since he didn't do it last night) and instead he went out for roughly 1 hour to have coffee and cigarettes. I already washed the pan, made breakfast and did laundry. He also rarely cooks or cares about that saying that he doesn't feel hungry. I told him that that's not how it works. It feels like we're roommates. Even worse cause my college roommates did way more than him.

He is also unemployed for the last 3-4 months but is being very lazy at searching for jobs. We have money for now as he got some inheritance so he pays all the bills related to rent l and utilities. I pay for all the rest. Groceries, baby stuff, home supplies etc.

He doesn't give me any free time either. I spoke with him many times. I asked him to let me go do groceries alone, shop is 3 minutes away. And he never does! The only time he watches the baby comes with a lot of complaining, him looking miserable and rushing me to be faster. My free time isn't relaxing, as I usually catch up on something at home though he doesn't want me to do that either.

It's all getting on my nerves more and more. Honestly I'm thinking of trying to save some money and dipping later on and moving to my homeland...I wouldn't want to take the father out of baby's life but it's getting impossible to tolerate him.

PS we are alone here no family from both sides

He just took the Bar exam this September, and a lot of our time together involved studying — I worked on my thesis while he prepared for the exam, and we made it work by spending time together over dinner or coffee. Pre-exam, he was great at planning and initiating dates, and communication was steady.

But nearing the exam (around July-September), things started to shift. I noticed he became inconsistent with messaging, which I tried to understand, given the pressure and anxiety that comes with preparing for the Bar. I brought up the issue, and he apologized, though things didn’t fully improve. I let it go, knowing the Bar is a huge deal, and I focused on my own stuff.

After the exam, I thought things would get better, but his anxiety about the results has only gotten worse. It’s been a month since the Bar, and in that time, I met his parents, we went on a trip together, which was great. But since October, we haven’t spent much time together because of medical appointments and typhoon Kristine. I entertained his invite last wk for me drop by his workplace, which I did but we didn’t get to talk since it was his shift then.

Problem: For the past three weeks, I’ve noticed he’s still inconsistent, and when I brought it up, he admitted that his anxiety has been psychosomatic and it’s taking a toll on him. I get that anxiety can be crippling, but I’m feeling frustrated and hurt by the lack of communication and connection. He doesn’t ask how I’m doing anymore, and our conversations feel distant.

What ive done: I’ve tried to give him space and offer support, but his replies are delayed, and he seems unsure of what he needs. I’ve even cried about the situation because it feels like he’s emotionally absent. He said he’s trying to help himself now, but I’m not sure how long I can keep going like this.

Need advice: Should I keep being supportive despite the hurt, or is it time to step back? Has anyone gone through something similar? Any advice is appreciated. TYIA!",1,1730015685.0,u_Sparkle_88,0,1.0,False

It’s cherry syrup with the right amount of sweetness. Anything overly sweet borders on the headache inducing territory for me, but this one’s not it. 

But sadly, the cherry fades after about 30 minutes or so. Then it’s orange blossom and vanilla with a subtle touch of coffee. 

Pros : Love the cherry! The coffee in the drydown is something different for me.

Cons : The cherry is gone within minutes, and there on, it feels like a generic powdery floral, sweet vanilla drydown (except for the coffee, which is the only thing different for me). Lacks complexity. Longevity is mediocre.

They’ve got a professional commercial machine and I got the hang of it pretty well, my coffees turn out great. But of course, things are very different with a commercial machine. When I purchased the Sage, my first 3 coffees (I think) were fine. I’ve attached a picture of this (I do better with the commercial machine lol) and also attached a picture of the failed coffee which is pretty much every coffee I make now. After this, I’m not sure where I’m going wrong, it’s the same technique, the same milk and the same temperature but my coffees are running out thin or there’s only foam towards the very end and I’m left with white droplets. I’ve tried all advice I could find out there, changed up the milk, don’t over heat, cleaned out the machine and the steam wand, changed my technique, it still won’t budge. I’m taking it to the shop to get it checked but if there’s anything else I could try, any help would be great! :) ",1,1730014101.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Just woken up and having a (strong) coffee this morning, clocks have changed so I’ve got an extra hour to chill this morning. It’s due to be a nice relaxing day today, run a few errands and perhaps read or game.

Trying not to think of teaching much next week as there are a lot of classes and it can be a little draining but once it’s done I have a fairly chill semester. 

I’m happy to talk about most things but I’m mainly interested in travel, sports, just being outdoors, and history. ",1,1730013832.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

I’m having a TKR in a fortnight and I realised at 2 am last night that I actually haven’t thought much about the logistics. I’m pretty well on my own. Can  someone recommend what I should have in place? I don’t have family living nearby. Apparently I’ll be sent home with crutches but I’m thinking a walker would be better. How for example can I even make a cup of coffee and carry it to the table? Any suggestions are much appreciated. ",1,1730013819.0,Kneereplacement,0,1.0,False

Come one. come all it's the 8th edition of the [Terror-Fi Film Festival](https://terrorfifest.com/). 

Here's the [schedule](https://terrorfifest.com/schedule) happening from Wednesday, 30th of October to Sunday, 3rd of November.

It's a great time for genre fans and cinema fans in general, but It's also my partner and I's favorite event of the year...

Unfortunately we cannot make or are keen on every film on the list, but as fan badge holders we still wanted to make sure every ticket got used so we're listing tickets for movies we are not catching. Some of these are sold out so don't hesitate! 

Honestly, it'd be cool to sell these for some monies (coffee or beer amounts), but we'd rather they get used than not so if you're suffering from the cost of living crisis and need some time in a movie theatre to sublimate, feel free to take them as a koha. Also, please take them as the pair if possible.

Tickets are actual paper so we'll need to meet up beforehand. Please DM (not chat!) to coordinate. Will update availability as they go.

Wed 30 Oct - Terrifier 3 @ 915pm

Friday 1 Nov - Gut Instinct @ 630pm

Sat 2 Nov - Scarfies @ 330pm

Sat 2 Nov - U Are the Universe @ 625pm

She flipped through songs waiting. Her eyes watched the front door in the side mirror. Sofia looked into the gutter out her window before finally it opened. Liam bolted out of the house. Sofia jumped out of the car as her foot scraped backwards into the gutter. Sofia hugged Liam before helping him into the car. Bright eyes followed Liam into the driveway.

“Where's my hug?” Harold wrapped his daughter into a big hug. Sofia didn't want to stay long as she climbed back into the car. “How's Brian?” Harold hung in the window trying to keep her attention.

“He's doing better, he's leaving the house more.” Sofia kept her words quiet as to not let Liam hear. 

“And how's my future daughter in-law?” Harold's smirk almost exploded Sofia as she gripped the steering wheel.

“OMG Dad! Stop! Can we not have this conversation!” Sofia started the car trying to shoo away her father. Sofia quickly drove off. Her mind relaxed as turned her music on, but a voice paused it.

“Hey Mom you and Dad have the same Mom and Dad right?” Liam's voice shot through her as she abruptly stopped behind a car. Her mind went blank as she pulled off the road into a parking lot. Sofia undid her seatbelt as she turned around to face Liam. 

“Li I want you to understand what I'm about to tell you, ok, me and your father were raised by the same parents because your father is adopted, we are not blood related like me and your aunt Maxie.” Sofia shook her nerves as she was about to start the car again. 

“Buts I thoughts I was…..no I'm your child am I blood related?” Sofia paused again. She took a deep breath before turning around again. 

“Do you remember our talk about where babies come from?” Liam just nodded. “Ok so then you know what it takes to make a baby, you also know that mommy it's compatible with men, so using science we were able to grow you inside me using the blood from your father, so you are our child in blood and love.” Sofia felt that was good. It sounds clean. As she stuck the key in the ignition he spoke again.

“If Dad was adaptive then what happened to his parents?” Sweat built on Sofia's forehead. Sofia swallowed all her saliva. 

“Liam, please don't tell anyone that your parents have the same parents.” Sofia fumbled her words trying to get them perfect. “Your father's parents……they..” She blew out all the air she could. Liam just leaned forward touching his mom's arm.

“Did something bad happen to them?” Sofia grabbed his hand holding it tight.

“Yes it did sweety, and it's very hard for your dad to talk about, so please don't bother him about it, what's important is that we're his family now.” Sofia started the car and got back on the highway as she popped back on the music. 

When Sofia got home she led Liam into the kitchen getting him a snack before leading him to the desk in his room. Sofia cut up his apple as he pulled out his homework. Sofia passed by Brian's room as he was tuning his guitar. As she pushed open her door her eyes shifted to Doge who was sitting on the edge of the bed on her laptop. Sofia crawled onto the bed cozying up to her. Doge’s typing was ten times Sofia's speed.

“Explain please?” Sofia asked, as she glared at the code on screen. 

“A bug appeared in the software and I'm tasked with sorting through it all and pulling out the kinks.” Doge’s words rolled off her tongue like she was all alone talking to herself. Sofia tried to push the laptop out of the way with her head. “They are relying on me to get this done by the end of today.” 

“I'm relying on you to keep me happy.” Sofia's head fell as Doge pulled herself to her feet. Sofia just rolled halfway off the bed as Doge paced typing away. Sofia reached for the floor holding herself up as Doge pushed the laptop into her face.

“Done.” Doge tapped a button launching a web program. Software started booting up.

“I thought this would take you all day?” Sofia asked, as she sat up taking the laptop. 

“I guess I just fixed it early.” Doge sat down next to Sofia as she dragged herself back into the bed. 

“Your mind is amazing,” Sofia said, as she handed over the computer. Doge set down the laptop as she pulled Sofia into your lap. “You're so sweet.” The pair gently embraced each other enjoying the romantic air. 

Liam sat quietly trying to focus on his work. PJ was running around his feet distracting him. Liam ran his eyes over math problems trying to figure them out. He rocked back and forth in his chair restless. As his chair rocked forward a screech shot out from the floor. Liam shot up as PJ bolted out of the door. 

“PJ! Be careful! I’m sorry!” As PJ shot out the door Brian scooped him up. Brian rubbed the cat, calming him.

“It’s ok bud, look PJ is fine.” Liam relaxed as he moved back to his desk. Brian looked over his work. “Ok you’re close with this one, you just need to carry that one over there.” Liam twisted his legs as he leaned over his desk fixing his work. Brian watched over his shoulder as he pet the cat. PJ struggled to break free as Brian set him on the bed. Brian ran his hands over the action figures on Liam’s shelf. 

“Hey Dad, can I ask you something?” Brian set down the toys he was looking at as she walked back to Liam. “Why don’t I have normal parents?” Brian couldn't help but raise a curious eyebrow. “Cause I mean, you can Mom loves each other, but you're nots together.” Brian sat down on the bed pulling his thoughts together.

“Ok do you remember the talk we had about the birds and the bees?” Liam nodded as he turned to his father. “Ok then you know that life can't exist without two parents, your mother wanted to have a child and asked me to be the father, all that is important is that you have two parents that love you.” Brian, satisfied with his statement, started getting up from the bed only to sit right back down. 

“How did scientists grow me in mommy's tummy with your blood?” 

In about an hour's time everyone piled into the living room for dinner. The coffee table was laid out with mashed potatoes and boiled chicken. Brian flicked on a family friendly movie as everyone ate. PJ tried desperately to jump on to the table as Liam peeled him off onto the floor. 

“So anything interesting happening at school lately?” Sofia turned to Liam who was in his little chair on the floor. 

“Nope, not that I've can think of.” Sofia wanted to hear everything about his school life but kept herself calm and patient. 

“Yeah, what about your friends anything exciting there?” Liam, tearing skin off chicken, thought to himself. 

“Well Chrissy was wanting to play tag, and I said girls couldn't play, and she didn't get it, so I had to explain it to her.” Liam went on and on as everybody listened. 

“Why can't girls play tag?” Doge asked, as she wiped her face. Brian and Sofia also wanted to know what Liam was gonna say.

“It's cause girls don't know how to play nice.” Sofia turned to Doge with a cheeky smile at Liam's words. 

“It sounds to me like you might like Chrissy,” Brian said, as he finished his plate. 

“No cause I don't like girls, I like boys.” Everyone froze as their hair almost blew back. They all looked at each other. Brian shifted forward nudging Sofia. 

“Honey, what exactly do you mean?” Sofia pulled words through a cough. Liam’s eyes were fixated on the TV. Everyone just paused waiting. 

“I like playing with boys more theys more fun.” Everyone blew out air as they sank into the couch. “Don't worry Mom, I don't like girls yet.” Sofia just rubbed his back as she picked up his plate. Brian picked up the rest following her to the kitchen. Sofia plopped everything into the sink as she started scrubbing. 

“I saw the look on your face,” Brian said, leaning over the bar. “You were ready to give him a talk.” Sofia stopped her motions in the sink.

“Is it bad that I was a little worried?” Brian just gave her a bright smile and reassured her that it doesn't matter. The clock struck late as everyone got ready for bed. Brian and Sofia tucked Liam in as PJ climbed in bed with him. 

“Good night buddy,” Brian said, watching Sofia kiss Liam's forehead. The pair left the room as they turned on his nightlight. Sofia made sure all the lights were off as she walked through the apartment. The pair said goodnight to each other as they entered the doors across from each other. 

Brian pulled his sheets tight as he made his bed ready for rest. Brian just laid there looking up at the ceiling. His mind wouldn't relax. He couldn't focus on any single thing. The darkness took shape around him. Brian sat up as eyes caught his attention. Without a second to respond a gunshot rang out. Brian's eyes burst open as he sat up. His feet scrambled to the floor as he turned on his light. His heart raced. Brian pulled open his door moving past the bathroom. His eyes peered into Liam's room noticing him sound asleep. Brian shifted as he looked to the front door. It was locked up tight. He slowly moved back as he turned away from his bedroom. He walked to the door across from his. Brian put his ear to the door as he heard quiet whispers. Brian just moved back against his door. He grabbed the knob and as he opened it he stopped. Brian just flicked off his light before heading back to Liam's room. Brian slowly crept inside as he crawled in bed with Liam. Brian closed his eyes as he smelled Liam's hair and let his mind rest as he dozed off. 

Sofia sat up in bed talking quietly as she scrolled through her phone. Doge laid on her back staring at the ceiling just listening to her. 

“And then the cops arrested him for a public disturbance.” Sofia dragged her finger across her screen reading an article. “Says here he had no comment as the police cuffed and put him in the back of the car.” Doge sat up cozying up to Sofia. 

“People are broken,” Doge said, as she nestled on Sofia's shoulder. Sofia kissed her forehead as she closed her phone. Silence filled the room until it didn't. “You're worried about him aren't you?” 

“I mean we live together and he doesn't tell me anything, I have no idea what's going on in his head.” Sofia turned to Doge as she pulled the blanket more over them. “I don't even know how he feels about us, I just pretend everything is ok, but I can't tell if he's just going along with everything because it's easy.” Doge kissed her on the nose.

“Nah I don't buy it, I see the way he looks at you, he is happy, I think he's just going through some stuff, you just need to be there when he needs you.” Doge’s words calmed Sofia as she turned away from Doge. Doge wrapped around Sofia as their minds drifted off. 

Sofia never wanted to leave her bed as her alarm roared. She just rolled over to Doge who was sleeping through it. Sofia reached over her stopping the alarm as the smell of hash browns took over. As she stumbled to the door Doge rolled over mumbling in her sleep. Sofia peered into the hallway as she heard morning cartoons. Sofia dragged herself back to the bed as she hung over Doge. Sofia ran her hand through Doge’s hair as her eyes slowly opened.

“Good morning, beautiful.” Sofia kissed Doge as she welcomed her to this great morning. Doge pulled her blanket over her face blushing before pulling herself up. Sofia left her girlfriend in bed as she headed for the living room. Brian was getting breakfast on the table while Liam was watching cartoons. “Good morning, wonderful family.” With a bright smile she greeted everyone. 

“Good morning Mom.” The men spoke in unison as they turned to her. Sofia climbed on to a stool smelling the herbs and pepper being tossed into the pan. Sofia reached over the bar handing Brian the salt. 

“So how did you sleep last night?” Brian didn't respond to her. He just leaned into his cooking. Sofia just echoed her words. 

“Fine, I had a wonderful dream,” Brian said, with a smile as she scooped everything onto plates. Sofia leaned back as Doge dragged herself out of the room and into the bathroom. Sofia pulled herself back but Brian was already on the couch with Liam. Sofia just picked at the food in front of her as Liam laughed at his cartoons. 

“Me tired,” Doge said, dragging herself next to Sofia. The pair ate slowly as Brian pushed Liam to eat his food. PJ made himself known as he hopped onto the couch. After breakfast everyone pulled together their things. Brian and Sofia pushed Liam out the door as they said goodbye to Doge. 

The apartment lost all noise as Doge sat quietly on the couch. She pulled her laptop top open as she opened command prompts. Her eyes darted across the screen as she opened a movie in the corner. An hour passed as she debugged and rewrote code. Her eyes shifted as her phone buzzed on the table. Doge opened her phone as Kitty came into view.

“Oh dear sister, I need you, it's a bit of a story.” Kitty turned her phone showing a blue computer screen. Doge needed to know exactly what happened but Kitty had trouble explaining it. “Oooh just come down to the shop please.” Doge froze up. She didn't want to leave. Her eyes darted to a single set of keys on a hook. “I promise you'll be fine.” Kitty’s words pushed her into the hall. 

Doge walked carefully as a neighbor smiled at her leaving her room. With each step down the stairs Doge gripped her jacket tight. As she got to the lobby the blinding sun said hello. Doge stopped at the door looking out at the moving city. She slowly moved outside as she inched forward down the sidewalk. Her pickup truck was hiding behind a line of cars. Doge looked both ways as she walked into the parking lot. Doge squished up against her car as she pried the door open and crawled in. Doge took a deep breath as she checked her mirrors. Just before she slid her key into the ignition something hit the window.

“Spare some change?” A dirty yet well dressed man tapped her window asking for money. Doge yipped as she double checked the lock. She dropped her keys as she tried to crawl to the other side of the car. The outside sounds of the world filled her head as she scrambled for the keys. Doge covered her ears as she rolled into a fetal position. Outside the car the presumably homeless man was gone. The scene was a fairly normal city street but inside the car was a mess of emotions. Doge swiped up the key as another knock hit her window. She shot up as Brian tapped again.

“Doge? Are you alright?” Doge lunged for the door as it burst open. Doge jumped out of the car into his arms. Brian hugged her tight, rubbing her back. “Hey it's alright I've got you, I forgot my wallet, where are you trying to go?” After a couple minutes of explanation Doge found herself in the minivan. Brian just stayed quiet as they drove. Doge just played with her fingers. 

“I know you think I'm pathetic.” Her words struck a nerve as Brian immediately pulled off to the side. Brian turned to Doge as she shrunk in her chair.

“You need to stop being in your head so much, don't worry about what other people think.” There was a pause as Brian collected his words. The silence felt like it would last forever until it didn't. “I had a dream last night, there was a gunman in our apartment.” Brian's eyes wanted to cry but he closed his tear ducts as he smashed his eyes closed. Brian gripped the steering wheel tight. “I don't need your sympathy, I'm handling it, please don't tell Sofia or anyone for that matter.” Doge just looked forward as he restarted the car pulling it back onto the road. After a few more lights they pulled into a small parking lot. The hanging sign said The Chargers. “Can you get home ok?” Doge reassured Brian everything was fine before he left back to school. 

Doge looked to the floor as she entered the building. Voices surrounded her. Doge clocked every pair of feet as she navigated to the counter. Before she could pull her head up someone grabbed her shoulder.

“Hey! There's a line! What the fuck is wrong with you?!” A man dressed in a suit made it his business to tell Doge her business. Doge just covered her ears as another voice shot through the room.

“Asshole! Don't fucking touch my sister!” Kitty pulled his arm off Doge as she screamed in his face. “Get the fuck out of this store!” The man shifted to Kitty.

“I'm still waiting on my laptop!” Kitty jumped over the counter as she pushed Doge behind it. 

“I'm working on it! You can get the fuck out until it's done! I'll call you asshole.” The man grunted and blew steam as he walked out. Kitty relaxed everyone telling them the system would be back on soon. Another voice pulled attention.

“Kitty, what's going on? Is it being fixed?” The manger made himself known as Kitty pushed Doge in front of a computer. Ricky was a tall muscular man in a tracksuit. Ricky lowered his voice when we saw Doge. “Doge honey the computers all blue screened after the Wi-Fi got unplugged.” Ricky followed Doge as she walked into the server room. Doge had one simple fix. Ricky took her word for it and killed the power to the building. Once the lights came back on, so did the computers. “Omg Doge you're a miracle,” Ricky said, slapping the counter. 

“And what am I?” Kitty asked, as she got in his face. Ricky's expression changed as he looked at her face.

“You got some grease on your cheek.” His words shot through her as he just walked away. Kitty grit her teeth as she walked into the back. 

“I hate this job!” Kitty leaned against the wall resting on her arm as Doge just rubbed her back. Kitty's meltdown was not over just yet. Ricky came back quickly.

“Peter called out.” His words angered Kitty as she cut between him and Dodge. “I hate to do this but she works here too.” His snarky attitude was only fuel on the fire. Doge just walked into the back and sat on the floor as they started their heated argument. It didn't take long before Ricky came up to her. “Doge honey I need you to put on a vest and help customers.” Doge just slowly got to her feet as she took the best from him. Kitty was back to finishing orders now that the screens were up and running. Doge just stood at the counter as someone walked up to her. 

“My battery is dead, I need someone to fix it.” Doge took his phone looking it over. “How long is this gonna take?” Doge just gripped the phone tightly. Kitty was too preoccupied to notice her sister's turmoil. Doge pictured Sofia as she took deep breaths. 

“I can test it now.” Doge spoke slowly but clearly as she pulled out her battery tester. Everything seemed to give a green light. “The battery is fine, a technician will need to further…” Her words were cut short as he swiped the phone from her.

“There is no further I need my phone now!” Everything collapsed inside Doge’s mind. All the sounds became louder and louder. 

“Hey jackass how about I break that phone over your head.” Doge came back to reality as Ricky pushed her aside.

“You can't talk to me like that.” The customer pointed to himself as he leaned over the counter. “I don't have time for your employee to take twenty hours to explain what's wrong with my phone.” 

“Doge honey, go wait in the back.” Ricky's kind words pushed Doge into the back as a loud slap reverberated off the walls. “I'm not fixing your phone! No one is fixing your phone! Doge get back out here!” Doge basically had to immediately turn back around. Ricky has the customer in a chokehold. “Now apologize to my employee.” The guy struggled but couldn't break free so he just had to cave and say his sorrys. Ricky pushed him out of the store shouting at him. Kitty and Ricky locked eyes before he returned into his back office. Another customer quickly entered the store.

“I lost my charger. Can I get another one?” A woman asked as she showed her laptop to Doge. It took only a matter of seconds to send her on her way with a new charger just like it did most customers. Doge was able to maintain her composer for long enough until another employee came in for their shift. As Doge left the eyes of customers Ricky hugged her. 

“Oh what would I do without you?” He asked, squeezing her tight. Kitty, watching this, wanted to break something over her knee. Ricky's aftershave and spiky beard rubbed Doge the wrong way even if she knew he meant well. Kitty stormed off out the back door. As soon as Doge was free she followed. Kitty was sitting on the floor twiddling her fingers. 

“Don't you have somewhere to be?” Doge didn't know what to say. She just started walking up to her sister only to stop as she spoke again. “I can't live up to you, I don't want to give the twin speech but look at me.” Kitty stood up, turning to her. “I look just like you, but you're the smart one, the pretty one, the ambitious one, yeah I know we work at the same place but I don't belong here, I don't fit in here, you're the bosses favorite I'm just the constellation price.” Kitty grabbed Doge by her jacket as tears ran down her face. “Who am I if you're around?” Kitty's eyes were drenched in tears as Doge grabbed her hands. 

“You are my sister, you are my favorite person in this world, I would be lost without you.” Kitty didn't know how to react. Before words could form the back door opened.

“Ladies, what's the rush?” Ricky clapped his hands trying to rush them inside. Doge just turned on his feet with a bright smile. 

“We quit.” Kitty didn't know how to react. Doge just pulled her sister around the building as Ricky stood dumbfounded. 

“OMG what did you just do, I'm filled with anxiety, and I'm riddled with guilt, and yet I feel so alive!” Kitty couldn't hold back her excitement. She ran to the front of the store repeatedly screaming we quit. Doge just quietly walked to her sister's car as Kitty bolted passed her continuing her yelling. “We quit!” The pair of sisters just piled into the car as they sang their praises driving off.

I moved here a few years ago but making friends as an adult is tough! Would love to meet new people but haven’t found a way to “break in” particularly with other women. My partner isn’t an extrovert either which hasn’t helped!

I’m 30, female and likes include: tennis, Pilates, food and trying new places, but am also interested in current affairs/international politics and living sustainably/zero waste. I’m also a little crafty - like to sew and embroider (so in a lot of ways I’m living my grandma life) 

If this resonates with you and you’re around the same age, would love to meet for coffee! ",8,1730013220.0,centralcoastnsw,1,0.9,False

Meet Lomi – a little powerhouse that transforms kitchen waste into nutrient-rich soil with minimal effort! I've recently been experimenting with it and it’s been a total game changer for my home garden.

Lomi works its magic by breaking down food scraps into compost within hours, not months. Imagine tossing in last night's veggie peelings and coffee grounds and getting garden-ready soil in as little as 4 hours. Plus, it somehow manages to do all this quietly, without any odor – two big thumbs up if you're like me and have limited space.

One of the coolest features is its app, which lets you monitor andhttps://www.leafgreengardens.com/lomi-urban-composter/",1,1730013205.0,Growingownfood,0,1.0,False

I broke up toddlers dad a week ago, well it became official and moved out a week ago. That day as soon as his mum and partner found out. The partner showed up at my door just as was leaving to go back to my mums. He was asking me who was getting the house and also said could they see her weekly. 
She’s nearly 2 now and since she was born I’ve been made to feel guilty if I did not send her to grandparents for babysitting ie if they went a week without seeing her I’d get comments like “oh thought she’d be waking by now” or they’d show up. They didn’t realise i just wanted precious time with newborn and now as a toddler. They ask daily to babysit her. If been a week they’ll show up at the door. I always tried to make a relationship with his mum but she refused to have coffee or really chat, and texts always been short. I found that difficult as I’m autistic one but always wanted to have that bond.

Now we have broken up, i’m back at my mums until rehoused. The tenancy was in both our names and still is but I’m letting him live there with no hassle as it’s not in an area I’m from and no family nearby. I am finding it difficult as overcrowded and stressful. 
He works full time and gets home 5/5:30 leaves 6:30ish. I think we spoke about him seeing her every 2nd weekend but he has now said that his parents want to pick her up each week or as often so they can take her out for a few hours (he wouldn’t see her) I feel this will be awkward and just routines. I understand if it was him. And I am not saying I’m against grandparents but just the thought of every week or 2nd week they’ll show up pick her up and take her away few hours. But now he’s also said that during the week he’d like to have her 1-2 nights his mum and partner will have her all during the day then he’ll only see her before bed. Ie she sleeps 8pm he comes in 5ish. Then his mum will either stay over or she’ll go to their house to sleep. 

We live an hour away from each other now (drive) bus is nearly 3 hours, I did say to him about moving closer and seeing her reguarly but that was a no. I guess what do I do? I thought that them picking her up every 2nd weekend and having few hours was enough but hes now making me feel bad and saying unreasonable to expect so little time with his parents as they’re distraught at break up",0,1730012953.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.25,False

1gd59ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gd59ie/aitah_for_starting_something_over_nothing/,aitah for starting something over nothing?,"My fiance (35M) and I (32F) were having a nice day with our kid (2M) until we weren't. 

He made me a coffee and I commented that it tastes different - that it had a strong after taste that it usually doesn't.

He says to our son 'Do you reckon I should get a new Mummy/girlfriend/wife, since this one always whinges/bitches and complains about everything'.. (earlier I had mentioned I had a relentless headache - I get terrible migraines - but I had to cancel my Saturday chiropractor appointment to get our son ready and our house ready for an early open home inspection because my fiance would have been incapable of doing that by 9am.

I wasn't complaining, it was a statement, but it irritated me.

I said 'oh Daddy should go get a new house slave if he's unhappy', which irritated him. 

So he retaliated 'House slave, I'd rather you work instead of mooching off me' and I replied, 'if I was going to mooch I'd find someone with money'.

For context, he earns 80k before tax and I've been a sahm for 2 years.

For further context, I paid the 200k  home deposit from my own savings 4 years ago, which he didn't contribute to. Despite this I out us both on the title 50/50.

In the last two years, I've received little inheritances of 18k, 40k and other little lump sums gifted from my late Grandma ranging from 5-10k a pop. 
I've also paid to have our home internally painted, all house maintenance and landscaping from these payments.

His wage has covered day to day expenses for the last 2 years.

He goes to work, and mows the lawn when promoted but doesn't do much else. Uses our kid as a scapegoat so I do all the housework, and 95% of the child rearing.

He also doesn't want our kid in day care, and has a job where he is on call, and we have no close family- hence why I'm a sahm.

Anyway, he's constantly on his phone. I 'hid' his phone because our son was wanting his attention and he only gets it when that stupid thing isn't within arms reach. It worked, he played with him and our son got quality time with Dad.

Fiance asked if I had seen his phone and I told him where it was.

So I go downstairs to cook dinner, and first thing I notice is my engagement ring isn't where I left it. I always take it off before cooking or doing anything with chemicals. 

To get 'even' with me for hiding his phone, fiance has now hidden my ring and is waiting for me to discover this... I've already found it, but haven't said anything.

Anyway I cooked dinner as I do every night, and he refuses to eat it. I can't eat it, is has an allergen of mine in it. So it'll go in the bin.

I just want him to get over it and move on. We both said things, but he reckons 'I started it' and I 'overreacted'.

I'm mentally exhausted and some days really question wtf I am doing. 

He always makes little comments that are going to garner a reaction, and when I give him one, he's always 'joking' even though no one is laughing and I'm suddenly always the asshole, because he 'didn't do anything'..

1gd57jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1gd57jy/my_suggestions_on_abf_features/,My suggestions on ABF features.,"After putting just over 90 hours into ABF and now waiting for the next big update to release I have had plenty of time to think of features that myself and maybe the community may enjoy.

Please bare in mind these are ideas that I would personally enjoy as a Survival games / Horror games fan, If you do not agree with some or all of these suggestions you're well within your rights to have your own opinions on certain suggestions below in the comments!

The great part about ABF is that we have a community that really cherish this game and we actually have devs who take in feedback and suggestions, that combined is a recipe for an amazing game!

Suggestions:

* Craftable plushies / Papier-mâché of each creature that we can place down.
* Paintable couches.
* More paint variants.
* A new chest variant that works like an ender chest does in minecraft but using portal technology instead. (Late game)
* Once portals have been opened allowing new creatures to come through can we please see some of the enemies randomly appearing around the facility outside of anomaly / weather events.
* As the game progresses it would be nice to see a slow increase of threats / enemies in the facility (reaching a cap depending on your difficulty)
* A way to make our own paintings.
* Please allow us to pickup a whiteboard somewhere in the facility, this would allow players to make notes on their own personal objectives / write whatever they want.
* face paints (It would be cool for players to be able to apply paints / styles through transmogrification.
* I know we have round aquariums but can we also get square ones / rectangular ones.
* A gold fish bowl with a normal earth goldfish in it found somewhere in the facility.
* A grappling hook.
* Some form of cassette player / Walkman that we can find alongside some music tracks.
* NPC's that we can find and interactive with allowing them to stay at our base.
* Pet toys (Maybe a ball that we can play fetch with) for the pests.
* More mini games. (Maybe we can find a golf club and balls to use with an empty coffee mug)
* Craftable training dummies.
* A way to permanently turn on the locations of other players whether that be through upgrades of pager or world settings.
* Some form of companion. (maybe a little robot with wheels)
* An item collection vacuum deployable to put near base defences that automatically suck up items on the floor storing them in a container.
* Ability to also use the frying pan as a weapon.
* Coloured text for signs.
* Biobatteries / Biofuel generator so we can finally use some of the bio scrap we have all been hoarding. (Can be powered on the go could also work for rooms with no wires)
* New weather event where the facility freezes over / is super cold.
* A craftable double bed (Each side of the bed could be a spawn point for a player)
* A fan / AC unit that we can craft for when the facility gets very warm.
* Ammo bench / ammo crafting station.

These are just a few of my suggestions.

I'm typing most of these off the top of my head and I'm sure more will come to my mind soon.

Please let me know what you guys think and which features that I have mentioned you would like the devs to implement the most.

Please also feel free to drop your own suggestions in here you never know maybe the devs will see them and take note!",13,1730012380.0,AbioticFactor,4,1.0,False

I’ve been on Prozac for years (was only on 10 mg for 2 years) and now back to 20 mg at the same with I started Vyvance for a few months ago. Have tried 20 mg, then 30 mg now back to 20 mg..
I am noticing very mixed results. For context I am a SAHM to a 12 month old and suffered PPD and PPA I am sure.

Pros: feeling great after 1.5 hours I take of for maybe 1 hour. Texting people and feeling very excited about things. House work is easier and quicker. Less social anxiety and can focus on conversations etc. Many not so many thoughts at once but the ones I have are focussed on negatives? Rather than calm? Less of a craving for booze. 

Cons: heart palpitations. The rumination is still there/ worse. Negative thinking is worse. I used to be able to push to find positives but now everything seems like ‘dark’.  The medication did make it disappear for first week or so and it was amazing but now that’s gone. Low mood is worse. Anxiety is worse. I can’t stop picking fights with husband. Sleep is terrible and waking up multiple times at night. Not being excited about things anymore: eg going out, trying new things with baby etc. I am always on my phone and reddit. Can’t nap anymore because not sleeping during day. I miss naps when the bay sleeps. 

Can’t work out if reality has just hit because this is clear thinking but in any case the reality is not correct because it is coming with huge anxiety and low mood. 

Am I just over being home so long with a baby? I also feel lonely and isolated like never before. I don’t feel like I have real ‘joy’ like I used to. But I was also not great prior to medication but maybe better. Not sure. If anyone has tried Prozac and vyvance let me know!

I thought it could be lactose intolerance so I stopped the protein, I reduced the milk from my coffee (now I'm drinking like 10mL of milk in all the coffee I'm drinking combined per day).

I just learned my husband has been using his credit card to make frivolous and unnecessary purchases behind my back.

About 6 months ago we really had a heart to heart about finances and decided we really needed to buckle down and stop spending due to the cost of living. We decided to cut eating out (especially since my husband was on a big weight loss journey) and speeding on frivolous things. We agreed to meal prep and focus on fun free family events and outings. 
My husband and I have shared bank accounts but separate credit cards, so I had no idea what he was spending. My intuition told me to check his credit card and low and behold he's been spending 200-300$ a month on coffee and eating out, despite meal prepping and preparing coffee at home. Everything he was buying was shit food, essentially fucking up his workimg out and meal planning. He told me he was truly going to work on losing weight and now I find out he could care less about that.
It should be known that I put ALL the groceries on my credit card, so he was essentially lying to me and wasting money. 
Not only was he speeding money on fast food and to- go-coffee, but SUPER frivolous things like collectors knives and specialty flashlights ( like he's fucking 5).
He bought a pair of boots for 150$ only a few months ago. 
Not only has he snuck these items by me when he walks though OUR home, but he's been looking me in the face for months saying we were on the same page with budgeting. And the kicker, we were suppose to be saving to try for another baby.
I have been budgeting for MONTHS and making sacrifices for our family, and to ensure my son could do sports..... Meanwhile he's out buying whatever he wants behind my back racking up debt. 
He said it's because of his food addiction and the dopamine hit he got from purchases. He's currently looking into getting a second job to pay off the debt because I refused to put another cent toward it.
I've literally confiscated his credit card and made him delete every money exchange app he has. 
I'm at my wits end. I have to treat him like a child because I can't trust him to not go spend money on useless shit. 
I feel like once a woman has to do that.... The marriage is over. I'm so furious with him, I honestly don't think I'll ever get over this.

I'm not sure what attachment I may have—im going with chaotic/disorganized for being both anxious and avoidant. Both profiles seem to fit based on context.

I randomly have been thinking about this guy I dated 5 years—likely since it's partially my fault the connection died. But the kicker is we only went on 4 dates. I found him handsome, he seemed interested after matching on Bumble, he had big life goals he was working towards. He seemed like my ideal guy for a ltr. He asked me out within 3 days and which was way different from the pen pals I was used to.

At this time, I was working as a CNA, him at a coffee shop while job searching after he just came home from his out of state college in California.

We had good chemistry and conversation flow e nicely. Granted now that I look back I don't think Made the best impression as I spoke about my CNA work over dinner with some graphic situations lol and also brought up some family trauma when asked about parents and siblings. It lasted.3 weeks.

One day, I noticed he posted on Instagram stories but didn't respond to my texts from the day before. I got viscerally offended and unfollowed him from Twitter before I remembered the mute button 🥴 I hoped he didn't notice because I reached out again hoping I might've been wrong about my interpretation. Also I noticed the texts slowed after date 4, hr mentioned date 5 but didn't schedule. I wondered if it's because I didn't let him come over. I felt it was too early to be at each other's place for any reason and didn't want to have to reject any advances just in case.

But now I looked him up to see where he ended up. He has a nice corporate job that could be well paying, still handsome, ive been thinking about how this couldve played out but this is where I think my attachment issues are most apparent in my dating life aside from a guy from 10 years ago—tgay door is closed but I still have some resentment as he's still on my block list unbeknownst to him, guy 2. Low-key I think I should've communicated better.rather than what I call light or diet ghosting. Is it wrong for a man to be sexually attracted to me so early?

Late 2000's, after seeing The Presige, I googled what Nolan was working on next and I found an interview he did where he explains the basic plot of Inception.  Unfortunately I cannot find the video, i don't remember which website, but i totally think Nolan would have had them remove it cause it reveals too much.  Also what he said is not exactly the final story but it reveals enough that together with the other fan theories the real story becomes clear.

So what I remember from what he said is simple, the story is about a man, Cobb, whose wife is dying of cancer and they go into the dream world to spend more time together. 

So lets put it all together with two other fan theories:

First another fan theory has established that the dream machine is a very blunt statement that most of the movie is a dream.  We don't question how this dream machine works despite how ridiculously out of place and how cheap and silly the machine looks.  This is similar to what Cobb had told Ariadne, that in the dream world you could end up at a coffee shop and not know how you got there, you just go along with it.

Second important fan theory is that the wedding band was Cobbs totem and that he wasn't wearing it at the end and that was the real world.

So heres the story.

A regular guy who recently lost his wife to cancer gets on a plane to go home and face his kids and new life.  He is in first class with a bunch of random people and goes to sleep and is fighting his anxiety in a dream. His dream reveals the problem he and Mal faced which is common for people dealing with cancer.  That is whether to fight cancer or spend time with family. This is a huge difficult decision many with late-stage cancer have to make as fighting cancer mean the drugs will rob you of your energy and keep you from enjoying what little time you may have left with your family. Mal's decision to jump was the dream version of her choosing to stop fighting and spend time with her kids.  And cobbs dream journey is him coming to terms with it and letting her go and moving on with his life.  

When he wakes up the other passengers do not act like they know him, not because they're faking it, but because they don't know him.  He gets through security because there is no crime, it was just his anxiet about going home.

We're both about 400 hours in and have never seen it before. I searched the wiki but the page is literally blank and I cant find any mention of it anywhere else.

","I'm an adjunct psychology professor, currently in the process of preparing course materials for next week. I wouldn't mind being finding myself a someone to chat while I am doing this.

The rest of the day, especially during the transitions from dawn to dusk, holds a special place in my routine. These moments are reflective, offering a unique perspective on the world, and I often find myself lost in thought during these times.

Accompanying me in these serene moments is Bruno, my loyal German Shepherd. He's a constant presence, offering silent companionship as I work.

If you're intrigued by the nuances of psychology, appreciate the beauty of day transitions, or just enjoy sharing dog stories, I’d be more than happy to engage in a conversation",0,1730009992.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

May naka-try na ba dito ng Vermax and Simplus? Kamusta experience nyo? Totoo ba yung 20 bar pressure ng Simplus? If hindi okay pareho, may mairerecommend ba kayo na ibang machine?

For personal use lang. Salamat.

Naka light naman na ready bago ipress yung coffee and nasa coffee button yung setting niya. Hindi na din ganun kalakas yung pressure niya kaya walang foam sa coffee. Anu po kaya problem neto?
