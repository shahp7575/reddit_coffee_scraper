Was my camping/RV setup for a while but haven't been camping as much, so its been collecting dust in the drawer. During the week we have coffee available at work. Its drip, its fine. A coffee nerd I am not. At home, I was gifted a Keurig years ago, 2 cups a day, Sat/Sun. I want to start doing more weekend grinds & presses. Buying ground coffee seems like a terrible idea as I'll only drink it on the weekends.   
  
So I've gone down the rabbit hole looking at manual grinders. I don't want to spend a lot on a first grinder.  Every one of those holes quickly spirals and everyone upsells on the next model up. I'm in Canada and finding something in the $50-$75 range seems like a task. 

I don't do Espresso, so not a concern.

1qnnv5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qnnv5j/two_weeks_in_the_books/,Two weeks in the books,"Heavy evening drinker here for 25+ years of gin and tonics. I know it's not a huge chunk of time, but I feel great!

1) First few days sucked. Lack of sleep and morning drowsiness was filled with coffee and early afternoon naps

2) Sleeping was a challenge. I took care of that and after a few days things got easier. My wife understood and slept in another room until I was ok for her to come back. (This isn't my first time doing this.) After 8 days I felt comfortable enough for her to rejoin me. First few nights the nightmare dreams were crazy! I felt like I was melting off my bed with endless falling feelings.

3) Weekends were a challenge around 4-5PM when I was start my evening ritual. Once I got past 6PM I was good. I drank lots of iced water in my similar booze filled glass and looked foward to the evening warm blankets and clear head.

4) For me now sleeping is everything. Any buzz I had prior was replaced with knowing I'd feel awesome in the morning and sleeping was where it was at. 

5) I've worked out at home for many years regularly. Booze has given me high blood pressure. My workouts kept me balanced for sure in my annual checkups. My doctor was warned me to change my diet. I never told him about my drinking, but I am sure he can see elevated liver enzymes in my blood and already knows. My energy was low during this two weeks and I supplemented that with an early afternoon energy drink. This helped me power through.

6) I live in Seattle and love my sports. I'm proud I got through the Seahawks playoff games (I call it sufferring to my kid and wife) without any drinks. That's a step in the right direction! Going to do the same for the Super Bowl!

7) I played golf with fellow drinking pals and didn't have any at all. That bridge crossed! I filled my drink need with an energy drink which gave me a caffeine feeling that took away the urge for drinks. 

8) Waking early for my daughters soccer and not feeling guilty or feeling mildy hungover was nice. The clear head really feels amazing!

There was a few instances that I had cravings, but I just told myself if I went through with it I would lose the healing my mind, body (liver) and other internals that were happening (start over idiot!). 

I kept in mine my 13 year old beautiful daughter and just kept her in mind. I don't want her to remember me wrapped around a bottle all during her youth. This has helped me through so far everyday.

If you read all of this thank you.

Good luck to all of you beautiful kind souls!

1qnnuar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlanning/comments/1qnnuar/disney_parking_vs_hotel_daily_parking_options/,Disney Parking vs Hotel Daily Parking options,"I have worked as an overnight valet for a hotel in the Disneyland resort area.  I've also lived in Anaheim about 2 or 3 miles away from the main entrances of Disneyland.

Here is my thought on whether to choose to park at the Disney parking vs hotel parking for non-hotel guests.

  
If you want the full experience, then go ahead and park at Disney's parking lots.  My main reason for suggesting not doing this is the following:

  
1. lines to wait for entering the parking lot

2. lines to wait for the tram

3. lines to go through security

4. lines to wait to get into the park

This adds roughly 1hr or so of waiting in line.  The fun continues when its time to get out of the park.  The lines seem even more of a problem especially when you are waiting to get in the freeway.

  
Alternate solution:

  
I worked at the Courtyard Theme Park Entrance, we offered non-hotel guests the ability to park with us for the day and enjoy the park.  I know this is true even now, but you do not need a reservation with the hotel or valet to park with them.  the distance between the park and the main entrance takes you roughly 10 minutes on a slower pace.  when you are ready to leave, you go back to the hotel and avoid the lines for the tram and the traffic that accumulates trying to go out of the street.

  
I am not advertising for the Courtyard, I just have first hand experience that they offer you this option if you rather enjoy more time at the park.

As an added bonus, you can rent a mobility scooter from any of the companies that service the area and have a more pleasant time not waiting in line to get in and out of the park.

1qnnt4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1qnnt4n/complete_75000_mm_romance_what_we_choose_together/,"[Complete] [75,000] [M/M Romance]  What We Choose Together - a second chance romance within a political setting","**BETA READER REQUEST: Political M/M Romance**

**Working Title:** What We Choose Together  
**Genre:** M/M Romance (Political)  
**Word Count:** 75,000 words  
**Status:** Complete draft, currently in final revisions  
**Timeline:** Seeking feedback by end of March 2026 (but flexible)

**STORY OVERVIEW:**

*What We Choose Together* follows Jordan Parker and Nathaniel ""Nate"" Adams, two Massachusetts gubernatorial candidates locked in a fierce election race—and bound by a secret on-and-off eleven-year romantic history.

Jordan is a progressive Democrat from a working-class background who climbed his way through Harvard and into politics through sheer determination and authentic conviction. Nate is a moderate Republican from the powerful Adams political dynasty, trapped between his conservative father Richard's control and his own suppressed identity.

They first met in a Cambridge coffee shop when they were both law students. What began as an instant connection grew into a hidden relationship that consumed them both, until Nate, unable to escape his father's manipulation and the family expectations, broke Jordan's heart and disappeared into his arranged marriage.

Now they face each other across debate stages, each believing the other betrayed them: Nate thinks Jordan weaponized their past in a brutal attack ad, while Jordan doesn't know that Nate was forced to end their relationship to protect Jordan's career from Richard's threats.

The story alternates between their present-day campaign and flashbacks to their original relationship and devastating breakup  building toward the moment when the truth emerges and both men must decide: can they choose each other this time, or will ambition, family loyalty, and political reality destroy them again?

This is a slow-burn, restrained story that focuses on character.

**KEY THEMES:**

* Authenticity versus performance in both politics and personal identity
* The cost of living in the closet versus the cost of coming out
* Power, control, and breaking free from family expectations
* Second chances and whether love can survive betrayal
* Balancing personal integrity with political ambition

**TROPES:**

* Second chance romance
* Miscommunication/misunderstanding driving the conflict
* Closeted politician
* Star-crossed lovers
* Enemies to lovers (though they were never truly enemies)
* HEA

**HEAT LEVEL:** Moderate to high (closed-door intimate scenes with emotional intensity)

**CONTENT NOTES:**

* Parental manipulation and emotional abuse (by Nate's father Richard)
* Forced closeting and internalized homophobia
* Infidelity (Nate is married, but it is a transactional agreement between him and his wife, no love and no betrayal).  There are children but born through IVF.
* Political homophobia and blackmail threats
* Brief references to a character's traumatic past (Jordan's abusive father, mentioned but not depicted)

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:**

I'm seeking 3-5 beta readers familiar with M/M romance who can provide feedback on:

1. **Romance Balance:** Does the romantic arc feel satisfying alongside the political plot? Are you invested in Jordan and Nate's relationship?
2. **Political Authenticity:** Do the campaign elements, debate scenes, and political machinations feel believable? (US political knowledge helpful but not required)
3. **Dual Timeline:** Does the alternating structure work? Are the flashback chapters clearly distinguished from present-day?
4. **Emotional Pacing:** Do the characters' emotional journeys feel earned? Are there moments that drag or feel rushed?
5. **Character Depth:** Are Jordan and Nate both sympathetic despite their flaws? Do secondary characters (Katherine, Richard, Matt, etc.) feel three-dimensional?
6. **Genre Expectations:** Does this deliver on M/M romance reader expectations while maintaining literary quality? Is there enough romance versus politics?

I'm **not** looking for line editing, grammar corrections, or extensive plot overhauls at this stage. Structural feedback, emotional resonance, and reader experience are my priorities.

**IDEAL BETA READER:**

* Enjoys M/M romance with substance and complex themes
* Appreciates character-driven stories with political backdrops
* Comfortable with morally grey characters and realistic relationship complications
* Can provide feedback within \[your timeline\]
* Honest but constructive communication style

**WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE:**

* Complete manuscript in \[Word/PDF/Google Docs\]
* Character guide and timeline reference
* Specific feedback questions for each section (optional)

**INTERESTED?**

Please email me at [judi010379@gmail.com](mailto:judi010379@gmail.com)

Thank you for considering! I'm genuinely excited to share Jordan and Nate's story with readers who appreciate both romance and political complexity.",1,1769451026.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

1qnnspr,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1qnnspr/sandra_and_eric_chapter_14_humans_have_weird/,Sandra and Eric Chapter 14: Humans Have Weird Traditions,"Shtaran was hyperventilating slightly in her room. The Reapers. She just watched three separate teams of Reapers leave her station and is currently on board with a fourth team. Jeremiah was so polite and nice that it didn’t click into her head that he might be a Reaper.

And not just any Reaper at that. That gentle, kind, and quite frankly dashing man was the same Reaper that had helped Eric storm a criminal ran warehouse. Shtaran screamed into her pillow in frustration.

*Why is it that the ship that accepted my transport request to Addrius Resort is the DAMN REAPERS?* Shtaran thought to herself. *There were at least 15 different transport licensed ships in port, but noooooo, it had to be one of the Reaper ships. GAAAAAAHHHHHH!* There was a knock on her door that cause Shtaran to sit up quickly. “Yes?” she said, her voice cracking slightly.

“Hey, Shtaran, it’s me,” came Eric’s voice. “Just wanted to let you know that dinner is ready. Did you want to join us, or would you rather me bring you a plate?”

*Dinner with a bunch of combat veteran black operatives?! WHY?!* “No, it’s fine, I’ll be out to join you in a moment,” Shtaran said, trying to keep her voice calm.

“Sounds good, we will see you in a few then,” came the cheerful reply. She felt Eric walking away from her room. Shtaran took a few deep breaths, trying to calm her racing head and heart. It’s a few days to Addrius V, she might as well make the most of it.

The smells from the kitchen did smell heavenly when Shtaran left her room. Shtaran followed her nose, reaching the dining area just in time to see one of the females, Jessica, practically strangling the pilot with his own arm.

“Say that again, you flying ASSHOLE!” she yelled at him. “I dare you!”

“Uncle, uncle dammit, I need that arm to fly!” the pilot screeched, slipping out of the grasp in some weird maneuver that Shtaran couldn’t track. “Damn, Jessica, we really need to get your temper under control.”

“Control yourselves, people, we have a guest with us,” the older gentleman, Jeremiah, said, walking towards Shtaran with a plate of some green vegetable that reminded her of a tree. “Welcome, Shtaran, glad you decided to join us tonight.”

“It’s no trouble,” Shtaran said, looking at Jessica and the pilot as they sat down on opposite sides of the table. “Ummm, are they….”

“Oh, ignore them, it’s not nearly as bad as it looks,” Jeremiah assured her, placing the plate on the table. Shtaran didn’t recognize most of the dishes, but the smell alone was making her mouth water. Especially whatever meat Eric was taking out of the oven and brought to the table as well.

“Hey, Shtaran, happy you could make it,” Eric said, carefully putting the giant platter of pink meat down. “So, tonight we decided to go with an Earth traditional dinner, so we’ve got roast ham, mashed potatoes, broccoli and cheese, gravy if you like that on your food,” Eric said, pointing to each food in turn, “and a bottle of champagne that should be a low enough alcohol content for you to enjoy as well. I went a little light on the seasonings so as not to overload yours or Sandras systems, but I think they came out alright. I’ve also got ice cream chilling in the freezer and a pie with some local fruits I picked up at the market currently cooling in the oven.” Eric pulled out a chair right next to Sandra, who waved happily at Shtaran as Eric had explained the food.

Shtaran sat down slowly, a little shocked at the amount of food on the table. “This seems a bit much for just a transport job,” she said, slightly stunned.

“It’s not just for you,” the second female that Shtaran hadn’t gotten the name of said gently, sitting on the other side of her. “Quin Miller, by the way.”

“Shtaran Redglow,” Shtaran said.

“This is also a bit of a celebration,” Quin said, shaking Shtaran’s hand with a small smile. “You’re our first client, and we’ve been given the chance to help the Galaxy at large. It’s not every day that we get to see the beginning of an era.”

“Also, every time a ship gets christened with a name and sent out on a mission, there’s a party,” the pilot said from down the table. “Adam Westle, at your service. It’s an old tradition from back in the days when we were still sailing the oceans.”

“That’s not to say we won’t feed you well, of course,” Jeremiah added as he sat down across from her, Eric taking a seat across from Sandra. “You’re both our guest and our passenger, so we’re going to ensure you are well taken care of during the trip.” Shtaran blinked, a bit surprised. She looked at the table of food, then looked along the table at the odd group of people. Eric, outgoing and friendly, Jeremiah, just as friendly but with more refinement from age, Adam, who was currently trying to annoy Jessica, Jessica, who was currently threatening to rip his leg off and beat him with it, Quin, who sat next to her with a gentle smile, and Sandra, her scales a happy yellow color as Eric got her a thick slice of ham and a few pieces of the broccoli and cheese.

Shtaran felt her shoulders relax a bit. They were just people. Very dangerous, very powerful people, sure, but they were still just people.

“There you go, hun,” Quin said, taking a bite of mashed potatoes and gravy. “It’s best to relax when you’re on vacation.”

………………………………………………..

Eric was quite pleased with himself. Despite having less spices than he normally used in a dinner like this, it came out rather well, and the champagne was hitting his system nicely, helping him to relax as well while Quin and Shtaran were chatting about… something. Honestly, he couldn’t keep up, but at least Shtaran wasn’t nervous anymore to be on a ship full of Reapers. He felt a tug on his shirt and looked down.

“Hey, kiddo,” Eric said, scooching his chair back some that Sandra could crawl into his lap. “Full?”

“Yeah,” Sandra said, her scales a pleasant yellow. “The ham stuff you made was really good.”

“Glad to hear you enjoyed it,” Eric said, smiling.

“Ummm, Eric,” Sandra said slowly. “Can I ask something?”

“Sure, anything,” Eric said, reaching for his campaign.

“Can you teach me how to fight?” Eric’s hand froze.

“What brought this on?” Eric asked nonchalantly, picking up his champagne to try and prevent himself from freaking out.

“It’s something I’ve been thinking about since HIM,” Sandra said softly. Jeremiah looked to be listening but remained respectfully silent. “You and Jeremiah are so strong, you don’t let anyone push you around or do anything you don’t want to do. Jeremiah even said that the Reapers are strong enough that they only stayed because they wanted to, not because anybody could stop them. But I can’t do anything without someone to help me.” Sandra curled up a bit in his lap. “I don’t want to feel helpless again, or scared that I’ll get someone I like hurt again. I want the kind of strength that I can protect myself and other people without being scared.” 

“I’ll have to think about it, Sandra,” Eric said, setting his glass down.

“Oh, okay,” Sandra said, her yellow scales dimming a bit.

“I’m not saying no,” Eric said, “but I’m not saying yes either. I have to think about how much I would be comfortable teaching you.”

“Oh.” Her scales got a little bit more yellow as she took that in before she yawned.

“Why don’t you head to bed for now, get some sleep,” Eric suggested.

“M’kay,” Sandra said sleepily, getting up and leaving the kitchen.

“It’s not a bad idea,” Jeremiah said, keeping his voice low so that it was only between himself and Eric. “The girl already has quite a bit of fight in her, and it would probably help if she at least knew basic self-defense, and how to shoot.”

“I know,” Eric sighed. “I’ve honestly been considering it myself ever since you gave her that laser pistol. But at the same time…”

“At the same time, you want to protect her from getting hurt or ever being in a position where she might actually need it,” Jeremiah said. Eric nodded unhappily. “You can’t protect her from everything, Eric. Especially with our background and profession. Might as well give her the tools to at least hold out until we get to her.”

“Doesn’t mean I have to like it,” Eric grumped, taking a larger pull of the champagne. He was reaching for the bottle to refill his drink when Jeremiah pulled out another bottle.

“Here, try this out,” the older man said, pouring Eric a glass. Eric takes a small sip and raises his eyebrows in appreciation.

“Mead?” Eric asks.

“Oh, are we pulling out the good stuff now?” Jessica asks from down the table. “Fuck yeah, let’s really get this party started.”

“You have stronger stuff than this?” Shtaran asks incredulously, looking at her champagne. “This is near the upper limit of what you can legally sell as a drink.”

“Humans have a higher tolerance for alcohol than other races,” Eric said before taking a long pull of his drink. “We have drinks that are 95% alcohol back on Earth that you could probably use as emergency fuel.”

“The champagne we have here is only about 10% alcohol content,” Jeremiah added, holding up the new bottle. “This stuff is double that. My own personal recipe.”

“By the Void,” Shtaran said, staring at the bottle. “You humans are really over the top, you know that?”

“Girl, just wait until you start taking shots of something like whiskey or vodka,” Jessica said, getting up and going to the kitchen cabinets. “Hey, Eric, where did you hide the whiskey?”

“Top cabinet, third from the right, second shelf,” Eric said, taking another drink from his glass. “And do not serve Shtaran any of that, we do not need our first incident to be a customer with alcohol poisoning.” Jessica just stuck her tongue out at him as she pulled out a bottle of whiskey and a couple of shot glasses.

“Spoilsport,” Jessica said, sitting back down. “Guess I have to just drink flyboy over here under the table.”

“Oh, you wish,” Adam said, cracking his neck. They both look at Quin in surprise when she slides her glass to Jessica.

“I like the taste,” Quin said with a shrug.

“Fuck yeah, now we can have a party,” Jessica crows, pouring all three of them shots. They all gulped down their shots as Eric just shook his head. Shtaran just looked shocked at the sight of the humans drinking something that would casually kill her.

Later, as Eric was stumbling to his room, he checked in on Sandra. The little Targondian was sleeping peacefully, causing Eric to smile. His smile fell though when he saw the box on the nightstand next to her.

*I really should teach her how to protect herself,* Eric thought to himself, closing the door gently, the black gleam of the laser pistol winking at him.

………………………………………

There was a knock on her door, causing Shtaran to groan in pain. Trying to keep up with the humans the previous night had been a mistake. The knock came again.

“Miss Redglow,” came a robotic voice, “I was asked to come and see if you wanted some breakfast.” Shtaran squinted her eyes, the soft light of the lamp too bright for her.

“Do you have the cure for a hangover, by chance?” Shtaran groan, slowly getting up as her head pounded.

“We do have some medicine for that, as well as a detox chamber if you wish to use it,” came the robotic reply. “Should I grab some while you get up?”

“Please,” Shtaran groaned, stumbling to the bathroom. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her normal pink skin was a bit paler than was healthy, but she chalked that up to the last few days of not sleeping properly.

After getting dressed in fresh clothing, Shtaran opened the door to find the android from yesterday standing there, a bottle of water in one hand with a couple of pills in her other hand. “Here,” the android said, “I have been told that these do wonders for a hangover.”

“Void Mother bless you,” Shtaran said, taking the pills and chugging the water. She immediately began to feel better, if hungry. Shtaran began to follow the android to the dining room. “I just realized, I never did get your name,” Shtaran said.

“I go by Athena Talos now,” Athena said. “At the time we had initially met, I still had not had a name other than Control. So, your ignorance is understandable.”

“Where were you last night?” Shtaran asked, curious. “I didn’t see you at dinner.”

“As I do not require sustenance, I decided my presence was not needed,” Athena said, her robotic voice seeming a little sad. “Instead, I was in the cockpit in case there was an emergency that required immediate direct action.”

“That doesn’t seem right,” Shtaran said as they entered the dining room.

“What’s not right?” Jessica said from the kitchen, flipping some sort of bread patty in a skillet.

“Her being all alone in the cockpit last night,” Shtaran said, pointing at Athena.

“Trust me, I tried to convince her to join us,” Jessica said, flipping the patty onto a plate. “But she was insistent on staying in the cockpit. I couldn’t even get Shao to join us, he stayed in the engine room all night to ‘make sure she keeps purring’.” Jessica shook her head.

“Shao?” Shtaran asked, sitting down as a plate of the bread patties were placed in front of her.

“Reaper Mantis, name Shao Liang,” Athena explained. “He is our ships mechanic and has been documented as being rather eccentric when it comes to machinery.”

“Hey, I just like machinery more than people,” a Human male with slanted eyes walked into the dining area, yawning a bit as he walked in. “And I don’t like alcohol.”

“You missed a great dinner and desert,” Jessica said. “Pancakes?”

“Bless you,” Shao said, sitting down. He blinked at a cup of some dark liquid was put in front of him by Athena. “Athena, you are an angel, you know that?”

“I do not believe I have the necessary parts to be classified as an angel,” Athena said as she walked away, “but thank you.”

“What is that?” Shtaran asked as she bit into her ‘pancakes’. It was fluffy and sweet, and Shtaran almost groaned in pleasure.

“This is the lifeblood that makes any engineer and military man happy that they are alive,” Shao said, taking a long drink.

“It’s a drink from Earth we call coffee,” Athena said as she placed another plate of pancakes in front of Shao. “It has a high caffeine content and is traditionally drank in the mornings to help someone wake up.”

“A wake-up call sounds awesome,” Shtaran said, eyeing the drink.

“I believe the caffeine content is too high for Cordan biology to be drank traditionally,” Athena said, her eyes becoming unfocused for a moment. “But I believe I can dilute it enough to be safe for consumption. Do you prefer water or milk?”

“Milk, please,” Shtaran said. Jessica sat down across from her, her own plate of pancakes piled high. “Where is everyone else?”

“The flyboy is up in the cockpit, Jeremiah is in the rec room doing who-knows-what, Quin is still in her room, and Eric and Sandra already ate and went to the grav-gym,” Jessica said, biting into her pile and moaning in pleasure. “Yup, that’s the stuff. Pancakes are perfect for a day after drinking.”

“How did you get good at pancakes?"" Shao asked, starting on his second plate.

“It’s about the only meal I can do well,” Jessica admitted, “so I ate it a lot when I was between jobs and cooking for myself.”

“Can I ask a few questions?” Shtaran asked curiously.

“As long as it’s not classified or too personal, go ahead,” Jessica said.

“why do you seem to hate Adam?” Shtaran blinked in surprise as Jessica laughed, choking on her pancakes for a moment.

“Oh, I don’t hate him in the slightest,” Jessica said after she took a drink of her coffee to clear her throat. “He’s probably the Reaper I know the best. Most of us worked solo missions and such, but Adam flew me to my destinations quite often. Compared to other Reapers, I’m a terrible pilot, which is not a good thing when you need stealth drops.”

“Why not use the teleportation trick?”

“it’s not subtle,” Jessica explained. “Every Reaper can teleport, it’s the one magic we must learn in order to become a Reaper, but teleportation is loud and hard to hide. So, if you want to get to a place unnoticed, you can’t teleport in, or you have to teleport well away from any people and hope they don’t have sensors in the area. Mostly we used it for extraction at the end of the mission or if we became too injured to continue mission.”

“Okay, that makes sense,” Shtaran said, accepting a cup of that heavenly smelling drink from Athena.

“Anyway, Adam just like to annoy me, and I like to put him into an armbar,” Jessica continues. “It’s a lot like siblings, you smack each other around because you can, not because you hate each other.” Shtaran stared at Jessica for a moment before shaking her head.

“Humans are just weird,” she said, taking a sip of her coffee. She actually did groan in pleasure at the taste this time.

………………………………………….

“Ok, you need to put the front sight in between the rear sight,” Eric said, pointing to the laser pistol that Sandra was holding. “Squeeze the trigger gently, don’t pull it. This doesn’t have any recoil, but it should still be a surprise when the laser comes out.” Sandra nodded seriously, paying close attention to the instructions. “Good, now, do you remember the 4 rules you always need to follow with any weapon?”

“Weapons are always loaded and should be treated as such, never point them at anything you aren’t willing to destroy, keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot, and, uuuuhhhhhh….” Sandra trailed off, trying to remember the last one.

“Always know where your target is and what is behind it,” Eric said gently.

“Right,” Sandra said.

“Good. I’m going to bring up a target now, and I want you to take a single shot at it,” Eric said, tapping on his datapad.

“Okay,” Sandra said, taking the stance that Eric had shown her. A laser pistol didn’t have any recoil, so Sandra didn’t think she needed to brace, but Eric insisted that it was good practice if she ever wanted to shoot one of their kinetic weapons. Apparently, those kicked a lot.

A target appeared in front of her and she made careful aim, trying to emulate what Eric showed her. Feet shoulder width apart, hands firm but not squeezing, shoulders relaxed. Sandra exhaled and pulled the trigger. She flinched a bit as the high-pitched whine of the laser caused her to lose concentration, and she barely clipped the shoulder of the target in front of her.

“That’s okay, that’s what practice is for,” Eric assured Sandra as her tail drooped. “I’m not expecting you to make perfect shots every time. It takes time and patience. And now you know what to expect.”

“Okay,” Sandra said, taking her stance again as she aimed at the target. Her next shot was still wide, but much closer to the bullseye at the center of the target. Her third shot missed completely when the door of the grav-gym-turned-shooting-range distracted her, and Eric grabbed Sandra’s hands before she moved the laser pistol away from down range.

“Hey, rule 2,” Eric rebuked gently.

“Sorry,” Sandra said, dropping her head a bit as she put the weapon down.

 “It’s fine, once is a mistake and twice can be forgiven. Three times and you’re just being negligent,” Eric said, patting her head.

“What are you teaching that girl?” Shtaran said as she joined them.

“How to shoot properly,” Eric said, resetting the target. “Did you want me to set up a range for you? We can get up to three running in here.”

“Maybe later,” Shtaran said, looking at the earlier score that Sandra had. “I just wanted to see what you two were up to is all.”

“Right,” Eric said, eyeing the pink Cordan. “So, you want to try again, Sandra?” Shtaran just watch for a few minutes as Eric continued teaching Sandra to shoot, her shots getting closer but never very close to the target. Finally, she spoke up.

“You need to take her tail into account,” Shtaran said, walking up to the pair. Eric looked at her in confusion. “She has a different center of balance than you or me because of her tail. What you’re trying to teach her might work for humans or Cordans, but not for Targondians.” Eric scratched his head as Sandra looked at her, and then Eric.

“I didn’t even consider the tail,” Eric admitted.

“Here, try this,” Shtaran showed Sandra a stance that had her leaning a bit less, but the laser pistol was slightly closer to her. “See if that works.” Sandra’s next shot was much closer to the target, and she looked at Eric and Shtaran excitedly.

“Well, I’ll be damned,” Eric muttered. “Alright, let’s go with that then.”

Me 30M, 170cm, 134-135kg currently( very very fat, i know). I want to slim down for real and plan for my wedding in 1 year time. I learn a thing or two from the internet some dieting method. Basically, all point to Calorie deficit and eating healthy. I try to get rid as much carbs as possible and wanted to start take protein. So, how do I consume this protein? I mean is it a replacement meal? Do I really need to take breakfast? 

I dont usually eat breakfast, just coffee. I also recently bought like fish oil, vitamin D, E or whatever to help boost metabolism.  Also appreciate if you guys can help out on brands recommendation and best way to drink it. Also curious, what do you guys eat daily to keep fit. My office nearby got so many chai peng stalls and noodle. 

I know exercise also important. I try to maintain 10k steps everyday. I can't jog for sure. My leg has been injured pretty good due to constant sports( badminton, sprain, swimming). Any of you guys tried HIIT before? Thanks in advance.",1,1769450992.0,SingaporeFitness,0,1.0,False

The setup is that a grieving couple moves to a new home to start over. The house is secluded in creepy woods. Some creepy things happen at night. Is the wife seeing things, or not? This is a common horror setup, and one that I enjoy. 

But as the story unfolds, there is nothing new or unique. The details, characters, and actions feel generic and recycled from mainstream horror. It's as though the author took as few risks as possible. It reminded me of a Netflix original horror movie, with oversimplifed characters that feel cartoonish to anyone with a modicum of life experience.

The story also had a HEFTY amount of repetitive, unnecessary dialogue. Every morning, the couple has a conversation about coffee. Want coffee? Sure! Careful, it's hot...This goes on for several panels every morning. The characters were about as interesting as two pieces of cardboard.

Just my own opinion. Curious if anyone has a different take. The high point of the comic for me was the art.",2,1769450923.0,HorrorComics,0,1.0,False

She’d been lying in a relaxed state of waiting for Ilse to get back for over a half-hour, now, knowing her friend wouldn’t be returning until likely the late-afternoon but still deciding to be here for when, it was inevitable, she walked through the front door.

“I don’t want to say I hate her, I know I’m just mad,” Mandy continued, filling idle air with her own internal babble so that she could occupy herself. “But damn it, it’s like Ilse isn’t even trying. Is this friendship worth less to her than it is to me? Do I care too much?” Hearing her thoughts out loud made her realize how lonely they sounded, like they were the musings of somebody who was in desperate need of company, except… she didn’t have any. She had her parents, who would sooner call her slurs and then attack her than listen to her problems. She had Ilse’s parents, who were much more kind and accepting and would have probably entertained Mandy’s woes, but she knew that wasn’t quite appropriate.

“I could just forgive her…” Mandy thought idle thoughts and formed idle conclusions, the sprawling mindscape of a girl who didn’t know she was allowed to impose standards on other people unfolding in front of her. She remembered wanting long hair as a child, but that wasn’t manly enough, so her father resented it. She remembered wanting to be a princess for Halloween when she was about the same age, but her mother only scoffed at the idea and told her that those costumes were for girls. She remembered getting older, being forced to wash nail polish off under hot water until her hands were puffy and inflamed and her nail beds were bleeding. Realizing that she liked boys, and then wondering why she wasn’t so sure if that made her gay; not that her parents would have appreciated a gay son anyhow, but she couldn’t help but wonder if that alternate timeline would have ended up a little less of a disaster than the current one, where they wound up with a pansexual, transgender daughter. They didn’t even know what those first two words meant, and the third one was as good as fiction.

“But I won’t,” Mandy shook her head, continuing to think out loud as her internal thoughts about all of the standards she’d had forced on her in her life circled like sharks in crimson water. She knew her self-esteem was almost nonexistent, and she knew that her upbringing was why; she knew that it was the constant reassurance that how she felt and the things that she wanted were too girly or were dismissed as the stupid, childish ramblings of a kid who didn’t know what she wanted. That wasn’t her anymore. She was an adult; she was twenty years old and knew damn well enough what she wanted, and she knew that if she wanted some of these things since before she ever even started puberty, they were legitimate.

“Ilse fucking owes me, man. I deserve the right to be mad.” Mandy threw her hands up and then let them smack back down onto the pillowy mat on either side of her. “I’m not forgiving her ass until she starts to make it clear to me that she’s sorry,” She said. “And I don’t mean saying it! I need to see it! With my eyes!”

Mandy realized, as her voice bounced off her bedroom walls and came back to her in a remote echo, that she was perhaps arguing with herself in a bit too heated a manner. Pulling back from that, she resorted to keeping her thoughts in her head, where they belonged, and once again staring at her ceiling with her lips pursed. If she was going to forgive her friend in any capacity, though, she supposed it would only be mature of her to break the silence between them and reply to that text message that Ilse sent her, the one she chose to ignore, early that morning.

Opening her messaging app with a hesitant tap of her thumb, Mandy pushed aside the feeling like her friend was doing all this on purpose. She knew Ilse wasn’t mean, just a little aloof; too smart and busy for her own good, maybe.

“I’m sorry for how I’ve treated you and I’m sorry for making you feel like it was you who had to apologize,” Was what Ilse’s message read, just over two hours ago now. It was plastic and read a little bit disingenuous, even though Mandy was sure Ilse meant well by it; it just wasn’t enough. Then again, no words would have been enough for Mandy, she wanted action by this point. With a sigh and a roll of her blue eyes, she pulled up her keyboard.

“look, maybe we’re both being immature about this,” Mandy shot Ilse a text, and saw her online status indicator flip to green instantly. “I want to talk about it, I know you do, too. let’s do that as soon as we can? tonight?”

Ilse began typing back, given the little bar with an animated ellipsis right by her name and contact information. It was a long moment of waiting and waiting, and Mandy had begun to think for a moment that she’d upset her friend, even though she knew that the Ilse she knew wasn’t exactly quick to anger. Maybe it was just her anxiety.

“Really busy right now, something came up,” Ilse’s text came back, popping some kind of bubble in Mandy’s chest and bringing her a frown. “Talking is good though. We should talk tonight, I’ll tell you everything.”

Mandy’s deflated expression said more than her thumbs or lips ever could, but still she began to type out another message. “be so fr,” Was what her next message was supposed to say, but as she switched over to the keyboard full of emojis and hovered her finger over the little cartoon of a wilting rose, she instead held down the backspace key. “alright man,” She typed with a shake of her head. “talk to you then.”

 

Fine.

Slinging a web from her hand and holding it as she hopped off the rooftop she’d perched on moments prior, Netzknochen- and Ilse- made some reservations about just what, exactly, she was going to tell Mandy. ‘Everything’ meant everything, all of it; fuck it, right? Her parents knew, Mandy deserved to know, too. Mandy was her best friend, and what they shared, their trauma and that lingering dread that only they seemed to understand… She more than earned her right to know about Ilse’s biggest secret. Maybe telling her about Netzknochen might actually do something to suture the rift in their relationship, as of late.

A backflip came as easy as a step down from a curb, almost totally autonomous in her head as she released her web and flew down the street toward a specific destination. The Eisenhardt Project had a building in Lübeck, as well as in many other German cities, and if Greta Strauss wasn’t a liar, then that was where Psy-Op served his time; if Psy-Op was there, then that’s where Netzknochen needed to be. The Shocker didn’t say that name for no reason. As much as she hated the sound of it, she needed to talk to the psychic.

The building, orange brick trimmed in a nice, white concrete along the corners and edges, was only two stories tall, and the front of it was decorated with a long, red billboard. On this board, above the tinted-black, glass double-doors, was a message; a heading for the establishment, to explain its mission statement in its own words.

“The Eisenhardt Project,” Read the main heading, bold in white lettering. In the smaller subheading just below, read a continuation after a colon. “Reversing Magneto’s Legacy of Evil, Dedicated to Preventing the Repetition of History.”

A very nice message, Netzknochen thought. It would have been a welcome sentiment in the city a couple years back when Ojo had almost turned everyone in Lübeck into a fascist, but better late than never. The building was clean and new, which made sense, considering that it hadn’t been built until 2023, which ended only a few months ago. February was marching along regardless of the drama in Netzknochen’s life, and her twentieth year- her impossible year- was beginning to just feel like another chapter in her book.

She’d never done anything like this, walking inside as Netzknochen and making demands. It made her feel like some kind of criminal, like she was benefiting from doing it, somehow, but she really wasn’t, was she? It was helpful to get to talk to Psy-Op, but that wasn’t personal gain, it was for her job as Netzknochen; it was to help her better understand this new couple of foes who appeared at the same time and were beginning to work together. If one of them was working with Psy-Op, that meant the other one had to be, too, and if the Wraith wasn’t on Psy-Op’s little crew of assholes, it was only a matter of time before she was roped in.

Regardless of how she felt about what she was doing, it was the course of action she had decided to take, and dropping out of the sky to land on the sidewalk just outside the glass doors cemented it. There was no going back now.

Already, the instant she touched the ground, people stopped their busy days and pulled their phones out to begin recording. Over a dozen civilians were gawking at their hero standing amidst them, seeming to reach out a supporting hand to an organization that- to be fair- fit her mission statement she’d given the public some time ago after she beat Ojo. She did love them, and she did want to make peace between Humans and Mutants, because she was somewhat of both worlds; she knew what it was like to be a Human because she lived as one, hiding her X-Gene from the world for a long time, and she knew what it was like to be a Mutant, because, well, she’d just swung here on tacky ropes of bodily fluid.

Despite how good of an opportunity this was for publicity, Netzknochen didn’t say anything to her adoring public. She was busy, and standing in front of a bunch of cameras to give a goofy speech about how much she believed in everybody’s cooperation was a waste of her energy at this point. Her issues with Mandy were the same way; talk was cheap, and by this point, Mandy was tired of hearing it. If the public of Lübeck and her best friend were going to find a way to believe anything she said, she had to show them what she was made of instead of telling them. So, Netzknochen walked inside.

“Good morning,” Said a young woman from behind a rather large, central desk in the middle of the lobby floor. “The Eisenhardt project is—” She then looked up from a smart tablet sitting in front of her where she’d been organizing what looked to be some sort of calendar or spreadsheet, and her hazel-colored eyes went wide. “Netzknochen?!” She made a guffaw of disbelief. “You’re the real thing, right? You’re not— you aren’t some cosplayer, are you? The costume is new but…”

“I need to see Psy-Op,” Netzknochen said in a blunt tone of voice. She didn’t care that she was on camera, and that the prison cells beneath her feet were supposed to be secret. The young woman- just about Netzknochen’s age, though she would never know that- gave the superhero a vacant stare and a curious head tilt.

“Psy-Op?” She parroted. “That Mutant guy who you put away a little bit before Ojo?” The woman sat up in her chair as her inquisitive eyebrows shifted over her skin, the color of coffee after a hefty splash of cream hit its surface. “Isn’t he in prison, somewhere?”

“Yeah,” Netzknochen said, “here.” She pointed her two index fingers down to the floor to gesture to the very building they were inside.

“What?” The young woman giggled, as if Netzknochen had told a joke. “We barely work with Mutants who have misdemeanor charges, let alone actual terrorists.” Her head shook, and Netzknochen didn’t appreciate the runaround. “Psy-Op wouldn’t end up here, I promise.”

The Spider felt a wave of frustration sweep through her, from her chest to her extremities. It was white-hot, and it was pure, but she swallowed it before it could blossom into genuine anger. What frustrated her so wasn’t one thing in particular; it was actually the complete absence of something; her Skelett Summen didn’t alert her that the woman in front of her was a liar. It wasn’t saying anything of particular interest.

Well, that didn’t make sense.

If this woman wasn’t lying and Greta wasn’t lying, then what was the truth? How could Psy-Op both be here and not be here? How could two sides telling her contradictory information both be telling the truth? The question irritated her to no end, to be honest. She wanted to lash out and break things, but that was unbecoming of a big-time superhero, so she restrained herself for the sake of others around her.

“Are you positive?” Netzknochen asked, but the woman behind the desk remained steady as her shoulders shrugged.

“Yes.” Her head nodded and black curls bounced with it. “This isn’t a prison, Netzknochen. It’s a charity.”

“Is… is there somebody else I can talk to?” Netzknochen asked, unsure if that could have been perceived as rude but also not really giving a damn. “Somebody who knows what they’re doing?”

“Um, okay,” Said the woman, cheeks dusting pink as she was insulted straight to her face. Her eyes widened and then batted, and she went through a series of shakes and nods with her head before speaking again. “Yeah, of course. There’s, um, my supervisor. I’ll— I’ll shoot him a text.”

She reached over the desk, beside the tablet in front of her, and picked up a smart phone. It woke up when she touched it, the default wallpaper displaying little more than a soulless, corporate art piece and the time- just about noon, now- as she unlocked it and opened a text messaging app before the screen was out of Netzknochen’s view. She supposed her prying eyes were unnecessary, what went into the text was none of her business, so long as it led to her getting some damn answers.

Not very long after the phone was picked up, it was set back down, and after a brief moment of exchanged quiet, Netzknochen’s Skelett Summen informed her of a new arrival to the scene, exiting a door on the wall far to her right. A man exited a room and looked with a curious eye at the small crowd coagulated behind Netzknochen, his head of graying hair whipping as he looked to his left and right. His hair held some brown pigment still, but the man was older- older than her parents- and seemed to be losing those signs of physical vitality.

“Netzknochen?” He asked, the same as the younger woman had when the Spider first walked in. “Is that really you? I didn’t believe the text message when I—”

“Do you have any idea where Psy-Op is?” Netzknochen cut him off, stopping the pleasantries before they could even start to take off in conversation. She wasn’t here to talk.

“Do I have—?” The older man scoffed, blowing off such a suggestion. “No, miss. Why would I?” He asked a rhetorical question, and Netzknochen breathed a sigh of relief. He was lying; finally, she was getting somewhere.

“Yes, you do,” She said, outright. Netzknochen didn’t let him lie to her, because when she knew if he was lying, it became less of a game of trying to figure out the truth and more of forcing him to cooperate. “Where is he? This is important. That little worm has connections with powerful people on the outside and if he gets them to break him out, it’ll be a nightmare for all of us.”

“Netzknochen, ma’am, I have no idea—”

“Don’t fucking lie to me!”

Spikes shot out from her symbiote’s skin, creating an aggressive, destructive appearance as she yelled at the man who seemed to be anxious about just admitting to perhaps his one greatest ally that he was keeping prisoners locked up under the floor. As her temper subsided and her spines receded back into her suit’s cherry flesh, she followed the older man’s cautious gaze; he flicked a glance over to the small ocean of onlookers who had followed Netzknochen into the building, most of whom were inserting themselves where they need not be, filming with their phone cameras and snapping photos. She’d unintentionally caused a scene, and though she didn’t care about revealing the Eisenhardt Project’s deep, dark, secrets, she supposed they did; if they wouldn’t tell her in front of the cameras, then she’d never know.

Netzknochen sighed. She knew she’d be seeing some clickbait garbage about this, but by this point, in her third year as Netzknochen, those were as plentiful as the articles that sung her praises. Her green eyes rolled under her mask, and her symbiote acted on accord of her whims, reaching out with dozens upon dozens of small, strand-like arms that fanned out in a circle parallel to her back. Coming nowhere near the people who all gasped and recoiled anyway, the tendrils of symbiotic muscle stretched and shot up to the ceiling, down to the floor, and over to either wall before swelling up and mashing into one another.

Creating something like a web of cherry-red gunk and then bloating the strings up so they transformed into something more closely resembling a wall of solid muscle, the dozens of tendrils closing up any gaps where light from the glass doors might have shone through and ensuring that sound was going to have a nigh-impossible time escaping. The crowd was muffled on the other side, and when the tendrils detached from Netzknochen’s back and her posture righted, she cut right through the tension between herself and the older man with a glare.

The younger woman looked at him with unease, and he didn’t look back at her. His eyes rested on the wall Netzknochen created, then flicked back to her, and then he gulped. “Fine,” He said. “Fine. Follow me.” He eyed the glistening wall of mystery material, a salt-and-pepper eyebrow raising over his forehead at it as his body turned but his head lagged behind. It craned as much as it could to keep his eyes trained on the new wall constructed inside the building right before his eyes until it was forced to snap back in front of him.

“Wait, what?!” The woman sitting behind the desk whipped around in her chair and leaned forward, tracking the Spider and her supervisor as they both strolled past the large service desk and headed somewhere to the left of it. “You actually know where the guy is?” Her near-black hair fell in front of her face as her mouth hung agape, and soon Netzknochen and the older man were too far away from her to properly conversate.

“Listen, Netzknochen…” The older man began with a sigh, approaching what appeared to be an elevator that opened up once he touched a button on the wall beside it. “I don’t know how you found out about this, but just because it’s a practice that we have doesn’t mean our mission statement is any less accurate.” He referred, of course, to the idea of keeping prisoners locked up in secret.

“Sure,” Netzknochen blew a laugh out of her nose as she stepped inside the elevator. “You know, making sure another Magneto never shows up by… keeping an ethnic group caged like dogs in total private where nobody can ensure that they’re getting the proper care.” She looked with an indignant scowl at the man, and it seemed that he could feel the glare’s heat even though she wore a full-face mask. “If he was still here, he would have cracked this place open like a jar and then made jam with you fucking people.”

“A— And your assessment…?” The man asked, the movement of the elevator shooting down making a quiet whir that both of them let fill the silent gap between their pieces of speech. He seemed unnerved by Netzknochen’s new look and her assertiveness, but she felt like she was making fast progress on this case; she wasn’t about to switch up the strategy now.

“Me? Oh, it’s fine,” Netzknochen waved a hand to bat away the question as the elevator door opened and she- assuming she could figure it out from there- took the lead in walking out. “A prison without the assurance of basic Human Rights is dangerous and morally repulsive, but hey,” She shrugged as she walked past the man, “we’re muties, right? We’re tough. We can take it.”

“Come, now, I don’t think—” The supervisor of the facility stammered up some kind of an excuse as he followed Netzknochen out of the elevator and the door slid shut behind them. However much he wanted to speak, the Spider cut him off.

“Oh, shut up,” She said. “Not like you’ll need to live with the consequences anyway. What do you have? Ten, fifteen years left?” Her words were hard and her eyes harder, but she didn’t grill him for very long before her attention came to the room she was walking into.

It was big, perhaps the size of the entire building above it, just significantly more open to make room for… walls with tiles of glowing, blue energy. Like windows on the side of a building, there were narrow rectangles shaped like doors cut out from the white, metallic walls, and these rectangles were buzzing with some sort of solid electricity. Lined up in rows and stacked one atop the other in two tiers, these crackling, blue fields of energy seemed to be the doors to cells that were fitted into the walls. In the center of the room sat a control panel attached to the floor, manned by a single person, who perked up upon hearing voices exiting the elevator.

The control panel was long and curved into something of a half circle, sectioning off a portion of the floorspace for a little nest area for an employee to sit around and collect a paycheck with their thumb planted up their ass. He was a guard of some variety, given the tactical way in which he was dressed, and he tapped away at some screen on the panel in front of him, which was decorated with switches and keypads and touchscreens. The guard looked at the supervisor, and the supervisor nodded.

“Which one of these is Psy-Op in?” Netzknochen asked aloud, looking to and from either of the men to elicit a response out of one of them at the very least. The moment her voice left her mask and hit the open air, though, Netzknochen was confronted with a conflicting sound that she wished she hadn’t needed to hear.

“Hey,” Came somebody from inside one of the cells, dragging out the vowel sound of his singular word before gracing every ear in the room with more of them, “I know that voice!” Unfortunately, Netzknochen could have said the same thing, though she wouldn’t have been so happy about it. “Come a little closer, girlfriend; you know I know you can find me with that spider-sense of yours.”

Under her mask, she made a sour face as though she’d just tasted something rancid. Stoic forever, though, her burgundy face and big, glassy, black lenses moved forward with a swish from her thin, yellow cape behind her. It fell over her shoulders after a handful of steps when she stopped in front of a portal of glowing, buzzing blue, turning toward the harsh light and then using both her lenses’ specialized glare reduction and her natural superhuman eyesight to peer straight through the doorway of energy like it wasn’t even there.

“Woah…!” Psy-Op let out an astonished verbalization as Netzknochen turned to him. He’d been lying back on a hard, metal board decorated with what looked to be a yoga mat, a throw pillow and a thin, tattered quilt, welded to the wall. His bed was horrid and looked obscenely uncomfortable, and even though she’d just been talking all that shit about mistreating prisoners because nobody was checking in and ensuring that they didn’t, she couldn’t think of a better sleeping situation that the slime-ball even halfway deserved. “New costume? And have you put on weight? Just for me? That’s so hot.”

“How can you not change at all in a whole year?” Netzknochen scoffed, her brain shooting its ideas out and into her mouth without a filter again. “365 days go by and not a single neuron in your brain gets rewired? Not a single belief gets challenged?” She shook her head. “I’m not here to make fun of you, as easy as you make it.”

“Here to make up, then?” Psy-Op wasn’t backing down. Whether it be from a grotesque lack of self-awareness or from a misplaced sense of pride in the horrible person he was, there wasn’t a hint of remorse in that question. “Or make out?” He sat up on his bed and leaned forward, squinting to peer through the forcefield of energy and run his gaze over Netzknochen.

“Open his cell,” Netzknochen said, looking back over her shoulder and at the two men who looked on, dumbfounded, from behind the control panel. The guard was sitting back in his chair, but sat up in shock as his mouth fell open in response.

“What?” Asked the supervisor of the facility.

“What?” Asked Psy-Op.

“Open it,” The Spider requested again, in total seriousness. She continued to look the men dead in their eyes, waiting for one of them to oblige her; it was like Greta said, she couldn’t imagine anyone outright refusing to comply with her demands.

“Netzknochen, Miss— Miss Netzknochen—” The supervisor stammered. He toyed with his hands, wringing them as if to strain all the sweat out of his palms so that perhaps they might finally stop leaking. Before he could continue embarrassing himself, the guard from his right side cleared his throat and spoke up.

“Uh, he’s, you know, he’s pretty dangerous,” The younger man said, scratching at his jaw coated in short, thin facial hair. “Keeping him locked up, where he can’t do anything to anyone is… kind of my whole job.”

Hoots from the other inmates, dozens of them, bounced off of the high ceiling darkened by the dim light in the room. It was like these cells drew on so much electricity that installing light fixtures would have blown the breakers for the whole facility. Netzknochen recognized some of these faces, and she could feel all of their eyes on her; probably seething over what kinds of things they’d do if they had the chance to fight her again. The noise wasn’t overwhelming, though, and she could still hear herself talk.

“I’m here.” Her arms crossed over the long-legged spider on her chest, the eyes on its abdomen glaring out in aggressive intensity over her forearms. “If he tries anything, I’ll plant him. Like a tree,” Netzknochen thought she seemed pretty convincing, and it was frustrating when the guard opened his mouth again instead of just doing what he was told.

“Well, okay, under normal circumstances, maybe,” He explained with a shrug and nod, “but that cell is full of a type of radiation that dampens the Mutant gene’s affect on the Human body. I open that door, that radiation is coming flooding out here.” He met Netzknochen’s gaze, his shoulders squared and his eyebrows high, as if he was urging her to use caution. “You’re a Mutant, right? You’ll lose your powers in an instant.”

“Permanently?” Netzknochen asked, raising an eyebrow of curiosity under her black lens. Not that she necessarily wanted rid of her spider-powers nor the responsibility that having them gave her, but the thought of bathing in this radiation and suddenly being cured of her Mutation- Osteogenesis Imperfecta and all- did cross her mind.

“No, no, of course not,” The guard shook his head with vehement urgency. “Just for an hour or so.” Ah, well; some things weren’t meant to be. He waved his hands and conversed with Netzknochen like he knew her, and that, more than the prospect of a total cure of this high-flying superhero lifestyle, piqued her interest.

“You’re not at all offput by my being here?” She asked, her words plain. The supervisor of the facility still stood off to the side, quaking, and that was the reaction that Netzknochen had come to expect from many people; if not fear, it was speechless awe. Like she was either a god or a devil, and never just a person.

“Why would I be?” The guard asked. “You saved my life just last month. That crazy person who tried to bomb the Mayor’s building? I was downtown.” He smiled at his hero, and she- just for a moment- couldn’t help but smile back, even if he couldn’t see her.

“Happy to help.” Netzknochen’s demeanor softened for a moment, looking back in her memory to that time but having a bit of difficulty remembering just one of the endless crises she helped to avert. “Now, please,” She approached the request from a different angle, as opposed to just demanding it, “open Psy-Op’s cell. I had you then, I’ve got you now. Trust me.”

The guard sighed. “Alright,” He threw up his hands, and the supervisor whipped around to look at him with eyes so wide they were about to explode out of his skull like a stressed-out pug. “I’ll do it.”

“Baby, what do you plan to do without your X-Gene?” Psy-Op laughed, standing up off his bed and rolling his shoulders, like he was preparing for a good workout. “You forget what happened the last time you punched me? I’m no battlemaster, but I’m pretty sure I can trash you in a straight fight with no powers.” His grin was as wide as his face would allow without it getting too big and just falling off.

“Alright… Opening the cell doors…” The guard spoke slow, as if to give Netzknochen time to call it off. His hand crept closer to a smart screen on the control panel, she could feel it in her bones, and he tapped it to select the right cell. A light on the top of the doorframe came on, a striking red, which was contrasted enough with the blue all around the room to highlight that Psy-Op’s door was the one being interacted with. Her Skelett Summen told her that his hand was moving again, nearing a mechanical switch, which was operable only after selecting the right door. Moments later, the switch was flipped, and her Skelett Summen told her—

“Scheiße…!” Netzknochen gasped. She reeled, the thrum of energy dissipating and the disappearance of Psy-Op’s crackling, blue laser-door only tertiary to the major sensory dissonance she felt. Part of her was fundamentally missing, on a basic, cognitive level. “Oh my god, it’s so quiet…” She blinked tears out of her eyes, her body’s confusion manifesting in the crossing of wires and her brain activating a stimulus for a sense that no longer existed. She didn’t cry out of sadness or out of mourning or anger; it was an autonomous response, sort of like the flushing of tears and nose mucus that came gushing from a human face after eating a hot pepper. “Sorry, it’s—” Her head shook, her thoughts alone populating it without some omniscient narrator feeding her a constant stream of information that she had no business knowing. “I forgot what this was like. Wow. It’s been a while.”

“Oh yeah?” Psy-Op scoffed. “Well, if that’s taking you for a ride, then how about this…?” He made a slow meander up to the empty doorway, his narrow shoulders swaying with a swagger that only he thought he had and a smirk pulling his cheeks off to the side. His face was unkempt with short, stubbly hair, which Netzknochen could see now as he got closer and there was nothing in the way, and the bags under his eyes indicated to her that he wasn’t sleeping well. Good.

Making no reservations about fighting a woman, Psy-Op strolled over the threshold and drew his right fist back before throwing his weight forward with his legs. It was fast, and without her Skelett Summen, she could only hope to track it with her eyes; but even then, there was a blur to his fist as he moved, like it was too fast for her to keep up. Her brain couldn’t process it quickly enough, and her nervous system couldn’t usher a command to her muscles with enough speed to tell her to react. It was a sudden movement from Psy-Op, and Netzknochen was without any of her special abilities which made her almost impossible to hit.

She could only manage a flinch, reminding her of the helpless girl she’d once been, and then—",2,1769450853.0,Spidersonas,1,1.0,False

Fumar is an impossibly powerful demon and would be the most terrible, dangerous threat in the entire Situationals universe if he were motivated by anything but giving himself a good chuckle.

----

CONTEXT (If interested)

The Situationals are a superhero team/universe I’ve been building for around a year now where most powers are conditional and come with ugly caveats - but every once in a while something shows up that doesn’t feel like science, or corporate evil, or a tragic accident.

It feels like a bad joke told by something ancient.

That thing is Fumar.

----

INFO

Name: Unknowable (Refered to as Fumar)

Alias/Nicknames: ""The Smoking Fiend"", ""Mr Smoke""

Role: Demonic Trickster Imp

Vibe: Prankster, Mischievous, Pestilent

Allegience: Chaotic (Motivated only by his own bizarre sense of humour)

Affiliation: Smoking Demon

----

ORIGIN/BACKSTORY

Once, there were countless Smoking Demons.

Each time a cigarette was lit on Earth, a Smoking Demon would be produced by one of the Six Cigarettes of Destiny.

The Six Cigarettes of Destiny existed in a ventilated vault, undisturbed for all of time. From this vault, Smoking Demons would drift out — an idea only considered rumour, by the Smoking Demons themselves.

This vault was located within the Realm of Smoke (colloquially known as The Smokers Lounge).

The Realm of Smoke was formed as a byproduct of Hell at the time of Hell’s creation. It exists in a kind of Limbo: inaccessible from any other dimension, plane of existence, or realm.

Fumar was just like any other Smoking Demon.

He was not truly sentient. He did not understand his nature. He simply existed — feeling and doing whatever it is that smoke feels and does.

Until the day Yezelboath was banished from Hell for reasons that remain unknown within the story.

Instead of arriving in the Earthly Realm, Yezelboath was sent to the Limbo-like Realm of Smoke.

There, he encountered Fumar.

Through Yezelboath’s naturally corrosive influence, Fumar began to change. He became sentient. He became curious. He began asking questions — about other realms, about existence, about what he was.

And Yezelboath taught him.

Most importantly, Yezelboath taught Fumar about humor.

Yezelboath possesses impossibly vast demonic knowledge. He understands outcomes long before they are visible or obvious.

He knew what teaching Fumar humor would eventually lead to.

Fumar became obsessed with laughter.

Not as a concept.

As a purpose.

Doing things that made himself laugh became his driving force.

Soon, laughter was not just something he enjoyed.

It was the only thing that mattered.
But the Smoking Demons were barely sentient. They could not be meaningfully pranked. They could not react. They could not suffer irony.

Humans, however, could.

Humans would be very fun to prank.

And so Yezelboath told Fumar about the Six Cigarettes of Destiny.

He told him where they were.

He told him how to reach them.

And he told him that they could grant Fumar the ability to escape the Realm of Smoke.
Fumar entered the secret vault.

He took the six cigarettes.

He did so not knowing the truth: that by removing them, all other Smoking Demons would cease to exist. Their smoke would lose all independent being and become an extension of Fumar himself. 

As soon as he put his demonic hands on them all the other smoking demons collapsed into formless smoke, smoke that gradually formed around Fumar, giving him his form, giving him their power.

For the first time, Fumar felt fear.

Yezelboath only smiled.

Yezelboath then showed him what the cigarettes truly allowed.

By juggling the Six Cigarettes of Destiny, Fumar could now breach the barrier between realms and enter the Earthly Realm. The cigarettes were imbued with immense, unknowable power — power sufficient to let something born in Limbo walk among humans.

Fumar learned to juggle.

From that moment forward, the world would never be the same.

Numerous events throughout history have been the direct result of Fumar’s pranks.

Not accidents.

He has no allegiance.

He is the last of his kind.

And he is the most powerful Smoking Demon that there ever will be.

And his favorite joke of all -
Is the one he pulled on Rick Manross (See The Cold Turkey).

----

POWERS

Smoke-Body / Smoke-Presence:

Fumar’s “body” behaves like smoke — he can appear, vanish, distort, and slip through spaces in ways that don’t make physical sense. He’s often present as a shifting outline with smoke constantly bleeding off him, like the air can’t hold his shape properly.

Trickster Reality Interference:

He has Mxyzptlk-tier impossible, reality manipulator abilities but it’s not unlimited omnipotence. It’s targeted, prank-driven, rule-based manipulation. He can literally only do things when and if they'll be funny (either as a joke on others or sometimes on himself - like how toon force works in Rodger Rabbit).
Things bend around him because the bit demands it.

Cigarettes of Destiny: 

Fumar posses the Six Cigarettes of Destiny which grant him with numerous, enhanced smoke based abilities, he has all of Cigarette Mans powers as a result as well as enhanced control over smoke and 6 special abilities that cigarette man does not have including the ability to make duplicates/dummies of himself out of smoke, fine tuned ""smoke bending""/control, the ability to change the density of his smoke, the ability to make smoke vanish instantaniously and more.

Fumar’s Biggest, Most Important Caveat:

If someone can keep him from juggling his demonic cigarettes continuously for 20 seconds, he is banished back to the now empty Smokers Lounge for a period of at least 10 issues. Therefore he must constantly have material hands and always be using them to juggle. 

----

PERSONALITY

Fumar is, at his core, a prankster — a weird little imp-demon who lives to mess with people in ways that range from juvenile slapstick to reality-warping cruelty. He’ll do anything to get a laugh, from whoopee cushions and cartoonish toon-force gags to deeply bizarre pranks whose consequences are more symbolic than visible. He might change the color of a dead woman’s favorite dress to her least favorite color just to poison her emotional connection to it, or pull maniacal stunts like making MechaHitler sentient, purely because he thought it would be funny. He loves making deals, grants powers for fun with ironic twists, and treats suffering, inconvenience, and cosmic consequence as punchlines rather than moral issues.

He does not want to destroy The Situationals - he finds them hilarious and treats them like a recurring bit. He is secretly, and often only indirectly, responsible for major in-universe events, including the perpetual reelection of President-Emperor-King Trump, not out of ideology or allegiance, but simply because he found the outcome funny. He is highly cartoonish, regularly operating on toon-force logic, and constantly workshopping new one-liners. He often performs favors for people with built-in ironic twists just because he finds them, their personalities, or even their appearance amusing.

Fumar is worshipped by numerous in-universe cults, which he finds extremely funny. He lies to them about the existence of multiple Smoking Demons and convinces them to perform bizarre, meaningless rituals to summon him just to watch them do it. His followers smoke everything they eat (from breakfast cereal to coffee creamer to carrot sticks with ranch), wear ridiculous cigarette costumes, commune in hookah houses worldwide, and consider pranking one another to be a form of worship - all of which Fumar treats as part of the bit. Outside of his ongoing pranks on The Cold Turkey, one of his favorite jokes was rearranging every word on every page of a respected scientist’s books, slowly ruining his credibility until he was publicly discredited and forced to retire. To Fumar, that wasn’t cruelty.

It was comedy.

----

TL;DR

Fumar is the last and most powerful Smoking Demon, created when Yezelboath made him sentient and led him to steal the Six Cigarettes of Destiny, absorbing all other Smoking Demons and gaining toon-force, prank-based reality powers. He causes massive events and grants ironic powers purely for laughs, runs bizarre prank-worshipping cults, and could be the most dangerous being in the universe - except he’s self-limited by comedy logic and can be banished for 10+ issues if he’s stopped from juggling for 20 seconds.

She was rescued from a hoarding situation over a year ago & was at our adoption center until a volunteer pulled her to a foster home this March. Her foster parents quickly realize just how unique she is.

We're not quite sure of Joanne's age, but the vet says she's a ""mature cat."" We assumed that was going to mean she'd be loafing around the house, but we were wrong! Joanne is very affectionate, playful, & entertaining! She is often found dragging around one of her (many biscuit mats, napping on a lap, or playing with the foster kittens.

Joanne has been to a handful of events like Coffee with Cats & Kitty Yoga. She is very outgoing & often a crowd favorite, so we can't believe no one has asked about adopting her yet.

Joanne does have a couple of conditions adopters need to be aware of:

1) She is FIV positive, but since she won't be mating or fighting with other cats, it's highly unlikely she would infect additional cats in the household. FIV+ cats can live regular, full lives but adopters should keep this diagnosis in mind because it can sometimes complicate other illnesses. Just make sure she gets a yearly checkup & get her to a vet if she comes down with any other ailments to ensure her FIV+ status doesn't become a problem.

2) Her kidneys are not 100% functional. She went back to the vet when she first came into foster care, & it was determined she should be on a prescription diet for kidney health. No other treatments are needed at this time & she has been stable since the Spring.

Joanne is truly one-of-a-kind. If you don't apply to adopt her, you are really missing out on a frisky, delightful gal who will keep you chuckling - take a look at her photos as evidence of her BIG personality.

Joanne has been tested (FIV+), is up-to-date on shots, dewormed, flea-treated, & spayed.

I used a coffee cone and made coffee via pour over method. Each cup was made with 2 Tablespoons of coffee grounds. Important: 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons. Therefore,  each cup was brewed with 6 teaspoons of grounds.

First step, cut down to only 1 cup each day by drinking half the amount of any cups after 1 for a few days, then cut out 1/2 again and so on, until you are at only 1 cup each day.

Week 1: Make each cup with 5 teaspoons regular coffee and 1 teaspoon decaf. 

Week 2: Make each cup with 4 teaspoons regular coffee and 2 teaspoons decaf. 

And so on, until you get to the last 1 teaspoon of regular coffee. If you want, you could go 1/2 teaspoon from here, and 5 1/2 teaspoons decaf, or just quit after a week of only 1 teaspoon.

I have a Lelit Bianca + a Rancilio Rocky Doser grinder that's turned ten years old.

It's not the best, at least with the Bianca: one click more is too much, one click less is not enough... the quality of the extract varies greatly, so maybe it's time to retire it.

I've examined several coffee grinders, with a wide range of prices and performance levels.

Reading numerous reviews on pseudo-independent blogs, which effectively indirectly advertise a wide variety of products, the Fellow Gen 2 Ode stands out above all the coffee grinders.

Perhaps it's trendy, perhaps it's hype... maybe it's truly good, but its design is more annoying than its price...

So here I am, begging for an opinion. I drink exclusively espresso, four times a day. I'm the only coffee consumer, so I don't have to answer to anyone. I have no price restrictions, within the bounds of decency and common sense.

Here follows my list - in no particular order - of the grinders I've considered. I ignore the latest arrivals and humbly accept suggestions.

The only caveat is that I'd prefer to buy on Amazon to limit the damage :-)

Met my neighbour shortly after. She's a very attractive woman, considerebly older.

She never told me how old she is. We started hanging out at night. Just chats and coffee at first. Started hooking up later.

We got very close, caught feels. But we both knew we'd never be in a relationship because she is much older than I am.

On December we both went away for christmas. She hooked up with someone as a rebound from me (she told me, this is confirmed).

Then she let me know this guy is going to come stay with her because he works in america and we're in South Africa, so he's gonna come stay with her so they could spend more time together until he leaves for America.

I was bumbed out. Anyway.

When we both got back to our apartments and this guy was living with her, she came over and we talked. We both admitted to clearly missing eachother, we embraced very intimately, not kissing, but we held eachother very intimately. She even admitted that she hates the idea of me talking to other girls.

Throughout the following week while this guy stays with her, and sleep in her bed, she regularly came over to say hi, telling me she misses me, we hug very passionately, when we're alone ofc.

I asked why he's here, she basically said he's a good match and tick many of her boxes, didn't mention anything about feels or love etc.

On New Years I was heading to a friend a few towns over, but before I drove I went to her flat to say bye, I said hi to the guy, then I lead her to my flat. When we both were alone I kissed her and we quickly hooked up, she passionately kissed me back, while this guy is in her flat.

Now a few weeks have passed and she's is pursuing a relationship with this dude. They are together, she has not told him anything about what happened between me and her and she's distant with me.

I know she had feelings for me at one point. She even told me how much she wanted to invite me on a friend's boat cruise last weekend.

I have no idea what she feels for me,

I feel pissed off. And I'm constantly finding myself wondering if I should tell this guy the truth. Obviously it's out of spite, cause it feels like she just threw me to the curve for this guy she doesn't even love. But I have no idea, obviously if I tell him he'd want to knock my teeth out. And obviously I we wish I could have her like I did at the start.

For greater context, she has invited me to come drink coffee with her and him and I have chatted with the guy multiple times. He does indeed suspect something between me and her and he doesn't want her to hang out with me so much anymore.

I'm wondering if I should tell him, do nothing, wait for him to leave... no idea.

There was a line of cars with an attendant in a yellow vest that read “Staff”. Beside him there was a sign that read “Event Parking $25.” There were at least ten cars in front of us and another fifty lined up behind us all the way to the interstate. They were waiting for their chance to pay.

I turned my head to the left and saw James rocking his arms on the steering wheel with a smile that curved up the side of his cheek bones. He could not wait to park and get his seat at the event. I clearly did not feel the same. Yes, I agreed to come, but it was a twist of the arm.

We paid the parking lot attendant and went up five floors and found a spot overlooking the arena entrance.

“I’ll tell you Paul. This guy can change everything.” His hand was shaking, coffee was erupting through the sip hole in his cup lid.

“I don’t know about change everything James” He dismissed my admission and exited the car.

 “Come on Paul I want good seats.” I grabbed my jacket and got out of the car. “Last time I sat further back. I think you get a better experience if you sit close.”

“Why’s that” I asked.

“You can feel the aura more.”

We walked to the end of the garage, then down three flights of stairs to the bottom. When we reached the arena entrance there was a large banner draped from the ceiling to the concrete walkway. It was a picture of a man with perfectly white teeth standing up in a tailored suit pointing directly ahead.

“Tony Bland, changing one life at a time.” Below it was a link to a website that read “LET ME CHANGE YOUR LIFE THROUGH ENCOURAGEMENT TODAY.” I rolled my eyes and James was enamored by the poster. It was as if he was staring at Jesus Christ himself; offering blessings to anyone who purchased tickets.

Meanwhile, Tony Bland landed 3 hours prior to the show in his gulfstream jet. This was his 78^(th) show of the year and it was only April.  It started in January and wrapped up just before Christmas. Five shows a week, almost every day, onto to the next city to repeat the routine.

It was like clockwork for Tony. He’d land in his track suit, with his own personal logo “TBM” embroidered on the jacket and pants. His coffee in hand taking calls, making sure the books are placed perfectly outside the entrance. The t shirts, hats, hoodies, and coffee mugs are on the opposite side where the sales reps greet the patrons. There script memorized, pamphlets in hand, ready to approach people about making the next step in their journey. “Are you interested in our online membership program beginning at $10 dollars a month?” They offer coaching courses, meetings with Tony for private seminars, and a free trucker cap for signing up.

I picked up my pace and kept my eyes forward walking directly past the reps and headed for the arena. All 8,000 seats were sold out there were lines everywhere t shirts, books, coffee mugs all being wrapped in white packaging paper and placed in bags. It was an efficient assembly line.

“Look Paul” James tapped my shoulder and raised Tony’s new book *The Long Journey: The Life you Always Wanted.* “You think I should get it?”

I was puzzled. “We are here I’m sure you have one.” 

“Yea but this was signed by Tony.” I opened the book and saw the autograph with “Stay at it” right above the signature.

“How much I asked?”

 “It’s only 80 bucks.” As James thumbed through the pages.  I couldn’t believe it; 80 bucks for a signed self-help book. Not to mention $30 a t shirt, $15 for a mug, plus the $50 dollars to get in. I placed my hand on my forehead and looked around “This guy’s making a killing.”

Two guys walked by and made their way to their seats. I turned to James “Are you going to buy that or not? I want to see the stage for this thing.”

I could see the stage lights piercing through the door and I blindly walked in. It reminded me of the Alien abductions you see on tv where you just walk into the light in a complete trance. There was a huge stage and there was nothing on it, but signs strung from the ceiling to the floor that read “Tony Bland” vertically. There was a large projection screen at the center. It was displaying the cover of Tony’s latest book with print below that read “Available today.” In the top right corner was a countdown to showtime.

Meanwhile, Tony was in the back. Getting his makeup on, sipping his coffee, and reading his x messages. “Where’s my pills?” Two horny goat weed pills were brought in a small cup. Tony cusped them in his hand and threw his head back.

He does his jaw exercises 10 reps by 4 sets “straight down, rotate, bite up.” he repeats for every rep.

Tony finishes and yells “Karen that’s the first part of my edge. Where’s my Starbucks.” A young lady with a headset brings his coffee “Mocha Grande Latte with extra caramel, right?”

The lady smiled “Of course Mr. Bland.”

He grabbed his coffee and sipped it fast as possible. He put his headset on — the noise from the crowd could be heard. Tony looked at the countdown clock and then his Presidential Rolex.

Someone shouted from the back “Ok your own in 60 seconds”.

Tony turned and thanked everyone for the support and gave a presidential wave. “30 seconds” Tony’s grin flattened for just a moment.  Then his lips turned upwards. “You’re on!” Tony walks to the stage and throws his hands up, and fist pumps for the crowd.

“Welcome, everyone!” Tony raises his hand to his ear. The crowd repeats “Welcome!”

James nodded and repeated the statement. I laughed to myself and scanned the room. I saw a mass psychosis forming right before my eyes. They were mesmerized by the stage, the status, the presences of this man. I just didn’t get it.

I grabbed James’ shoulder “This guy’s cheesy” and he waved his hand to shoo me away.

Tony began “I want to thank you guys for being here. I can’t tell this audience just how pumped I am to in your presence. Our future leaders. I want you to know todays the first step. And well, first steps are never easy.”

Tony pauses to look at the floor, then raises the microphone to his forehead. “Life is challenging but I believe, I truly believe, we are put on this earth to help people. To be a beacon of hope for others.”

 Tony walks to the far side of the stage. Winks at the woman with big titties in the front row.  “Today I’m here to help you. Today your life will change if you follow these steps, these new habits, you will look back and remember this day as the day I said I’m not going to take it anymore. I’m done with the crappy job and lack of finances. I’m done not living up to my potential. I’m done not having a plan. So let me give you step number one.” A power point appeared, and Tony held up his first finger.

I could not believe what I was seeing. It was as if the entire room was being inebriated. The Asian man sitting beside me dropped his cell phone in the middle of the aisle where he let it lie. Nobody was looking around. Nobody was going to the bathroom. They were transfixed on the stage. On the man transmitting this hope. I rubbed my hands on my eyes. I could feel the itch to watch.

“Take these notes down.” Tony said with a broad smile. The crowd began to pull notepads from bags, purses, and even their back pocket. He held up his right index finger “ONE, invest in yourself. You are the brand, the product, the income producer, and the only person that matters.”

I watched as others took notes. Rule number one was the formula for his entire shtick and he’s selling it back to his audience.  

Tony went on and on. I watched the crowd, and I watched Tony. He was a salesman. He wasn’t selling you a physical product. No, he was selling hope to a bunch of hopeless people. They were the product, and he was the business. Maybe it was an even exchange?

After 45 minutes of presenting power points, tips, one liners, and most of all hope, Tony waved to the crowd “Chase your dreams!” and exited the stage.

I was entertained and I could feel the warmth Tony provided. James remained seated for a few moments. He stared at the stage absorbing the experience. Around two minutes later he stood with a huge smile. His shoulders were relaxed. His first step was a bit wobbly. He turned to me and asked me how I liked the show.

“It was more entertaining than I thought it was going to be.” James ignored my comment and faced forward.

His pace was faster than mine keeping him a few steps ahead. “These shows always get me charged up. I feel like anything’s possible after I get started…I must get started.” James looked down at the tile.

“Isn’t that what you come for? To get a plan and act?” I asked. James sped up and walked to the bathroom while I waited outside. I watched as people exited, and I noticed something. They all had a smile on their face. Maybe it isn’t about changing lives?

When we got to the parking garage, we found James’s car and got inside. You could see the arena and the side parking lot where fans were gathering. A barricaded path from the arena side door to three black SUVs was carved out of the crowd.

James put his key in the ignition and turned it. The engine tried to start but never fully turned over. “Damn, I got to work tomorrow.” He punched the steering wheel and dropped his head. “Man, after spending this money today I really can’t afford to put my car in the shop.”

Tony exited the arena with a beautiful blonde hair woman, and two bodyguard on each side of him. He stopped to sign a few auto graphs and take some pictures with people waiting. He smirked and waved. The crowd was begging for more.

James still had his head on his steering wheel. After a few more photo ops Tony walked up to the third SUV and a man opened the door for him. He stood on the running board and waved to the crowd in a long left to right motion. I could hear the screams inside the car.  He then blew an encore kiss and closed the door. They drove off headed to the airport for his next gig tomorrow in Wichita.

I tapped James’s shoulder, and he lifted his head. “Man, you missed Tony, he just left. He was signing autographs.”

James was no longer smiling. I couldn’t even look.

“I’m screwed if this car doesn’t start.” He sat up fixed his posture and took a deep breathe before turning the key.

The car stuttered a few times. James gave it gas. The engine turned over and smoke shot out the exhaust. James gripped the top of the steering wheel with both hands and looked up at the sky to thank God.

He took one more deep breath and lowered his head. “See John, I told you these conferences are fun.” I nodded to agree. “I need to save some money for a car, but next time Tony’s in town we should catch another show.”

I looked out the window as we headed down the highway and couldn’t help but think, it’s healthier than going to the bar. Even though it does the same thing.

1qnndvd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qnndvd,Breville Express Impress: Beginners guide & my thoughts after 2 months,"I'm a beginner with a head start. I messed around with espresso for a year in college so I understand the variables that can affect the drink. Until now, I recently bought a machine and I'm rekindling my interest. 

I've had my flat whites pretty dialed in. Enough that it tastes very pleasant & often better than my favorite local coffee shop (if they have a new barista).
-----------------------------

MY CURRENT SETTINGS & PULL for light/med roast:

Internal Burr @ setting 3
Grind dial size 7
19g dose
38g out
29 sec pull

-----------------------------
MACHINE ADJUSTMENTS:

1. Adjust bur setting from the hopper (not just grind setting). YouTube inner bur adjustment. I moved mine to setting 3 as many have suggested. 

2. Grind size dial,  ask your local roaster to give you a small cup of coffee grounds they use.  Take it home. Feel it in your hands, adjust grind size to get similar size/feel

3. Temperature adjustment EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I just learned you can factory temp of the boiler. YouTube this! Different roast levels requires different water temp. I use highest temp @ 96 degrees for light/med roast. This alone took my slightly sour drink to a balanced one.

4. Manual preinfusion: you can hold the brew button and release when you want full pressure to start. The breville preinfusion is slightly longer. My local barista says they do about 6-9 sec. I do 8sec and have had good results. 
-----------------------------

GADGETS (all these I feel like are crucial gadgets to increase efficiency & consistency):

1. Funnel + distribution set (Matow brand): I've only found one on Amazon that comes in a set. Game changer. Even distribution. Allows more dose @19g without mess.

2. Bottomless Portafiler (Normacore 54mm). cool factor. works great and
can visually inspect if drink is pulling correctly (no squirting, tigerstripes)

3. Basket 18-22g I believe (Big Bang 54mm). Allows me to dose more than breville stock baskets that can fit 16g-ish. This basket is supposed to be a top upgrade for even flow. 

4. WDT tool. I WDT the s**t out of my grind. Break up the clumps for more even extraction. 

5. Digital Scale. VERY IMPORTANT.  This allows me to use the exact amount of beans in every shot. I weigh 19g put into grinder. Get 19g out. Once it finishes grinding (high pitch) I press grind one more time, and often a little bit comes out.
-----------------------------

FINAL THOUGHTS:

I'm very impressed with the machine. Highly recommend for beginners. 

The grinder is fine for what I seek at the moment.  I can get a flat white fairly close to my roasters. 

The built in tamping I feel like is a valuable tool for absolute beginners to increase consistency (same level tamp every time). I believe it may slightly be holding me back from more manual adjustment as I do think the tamping pressure isn't enough for the amount of dose I use with my current basket. However I'm still able to get a fairly pleasant flat white out of it. 

Also milk is also a big factor in taste. I love the taste of my local roaster, so I bought the same oat milk they use to see how close i can get my final product to theirs. The taste between different brands and types of milk/non dairy are huge.  Make sure you're comparing apples to apples.

Stick to one bean/roast. Buy from local roaster who's drink you like. Try to get your drink as close to theirs as possible. Talk to baristas to get some tips. I learned so much from asking!

Lastly, it is a trial and error hobby. I've made so many nasty bitter and sour drinks. Used almost half the bag to dial in. 

 You gotta put in the time to fail in order to find what's right. Learn from YouTube all the variables that can affect your drink. Learn about 1:2 dose to espresso ratio & aim for 25-30sec pull.

Hope this helps a few people!

After using Studio to design my recent builds, it was nice to return to physical bricks and see this one come to life in person. In the spirit of Impressionism, I decided not to follow my original digital design but built this mostly based on feel.

This was a freestyle process that involved layering hundreds of 2x4s, 1x6s, and 1x3s. Technique-wise, it doesn't really get any easier than this, as it's just stacking plates. 

Despite the simplicity of the build, the use of color and depth still allows for a satisfying visual result. The way that natural light reflects off of various pieces, especially the cheese slopes, adds a new layer to the build which makes me glad to have built this in real life.

LEGO recently introduced two new colors, warm pink and blue violet, which I think would blend in really nicely in the areas between the water and the cloud reflections. I'll probably keep updating this piece as more parts become available, but this is a wrap on the Monet for now. There’s rumors of an official set coming in March so even if my design isn’t selected, we should have Monet in LEGO soon!

1qnn4zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qnn4zf/the_psychology_of_longdistance_relationships_what/,The Psychology of Long-Distance Relationships: What Actually Works (Science-Based),"Studied relationship psychology for 2 years and dove deep into research, books, podcasts. Here's what actually works (and what doesn't).

Everyone's selling you romance. ""Love conquers all"" they say. ""Distance means nothing when someone means everything."" Cool quote for Instagram. Terrible advice for real life.

LDRs have a 58% breakup rate according to research. That's not because people don't love each other enough. It's because most couples are running on feelings alone without understanding the actual mechanics of what makes distance work.

I've consumed everything from Esther Perel's podcasts to relationship studies, and the truth is way more nuanced than ""just communicate more."" Here's what the data and experts actually show:

**The foundation isn't trust, it's security**

Matthew Hussey nails this in his work. Trust is passive. Security is active. You build security through consistent behavior over time. Not grand gestures. Not 3 hour FaceTime calls where you stare at each other eating dinner.

Security comes from showing up when you say you will. Responding within reasonable timeframes. Making your partner feel chosen even when they're not physically there. Research from the Journal of Communication shows couples who maintain ""mundane realism"" (sharing boring daily stuff) actually report higher satisfaction than those who only connect for ""quality time.""

Basically, send the random photo of your coffee. Share the dumb thing your coworker said. Make them feel present in your actual life, not just the highlighted reel.

**You need a shared vision or you're cooked**

Dr. Stan Tatkin's work on attachment theory is INSANE for understanding this. His book ""Wired for Love"" breaks down why LDRs fail even when both people are ""trying."" The issue? They're trying in different directions.

You both need crystal clear answers to: When does the distance end? Who's moving? What are we building toward?

Vague ""we'll figure it out"" energy is relationship poison. The uncertainty creates anxiety that bleeds into every interaction. You start fights about nothing because the real issue (no end date) feels too scary to address.

One practice that helps: monthly state of the union talks. Literally schedule it. Discuss what's working, what isn't, and recalibrate expectations. Sounds corporate but it works.

**The app that changed everything for couples I know**

Ash is legitimately good for this. It's an AI relationship coach that helps you navigate the specific challenges of distance. I've seen couples use it to work through jealousy, communication breakdowns, all that messy stuff that builds up when you can't just hash things out face to face.

What makes it different from just venting to friends is it gives you actual frameworks and scripts based on attachment styles and communication research. Sometimes you need that third party perspective that isn't just ""dump them"" or ""they're perfect for you"" depending on which friend you ask.

If you want something more structured for the long haul, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that pulls from relationship books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans.

You can set a specific goal like ""navigate long-distance as someone with anxious attachment"" and it builds a plan just for your situation. The content comes from sources like the books mentioned here plus relationship psychology research, all broken down into digestible audio you can listen to during your commute. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples when you want to really understand something. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about specific struggles, which has been surprisingly helpful for working through relationship patterns without oversharing with your entire friend group.

**The jealousy thing everyone pretends isn't real**

Your partner's going out without you. Meeting new people. Living a whole life you're not part of. That's gonna sting sometimes. Pretending it won't is delusional.

The research is clear though, jealousy isn't about trust most of the time. It's about insecurity and lack of control. Dr. Robert Leahy's work on cognitive behavioral approaches shows that addressing the underlying thoughts (""they'll realize they can do better"") is way more effective than trying to control behaviors.

The podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel has episodes on this that are brutally honest. She talks about how modern relationships demand both security AND freedom, and how that tension gets amplified by distance. Best relationship content I've consumed honestly.

**The visit schedule matters more than you think**

Random visits feel romantic. Scheduled visits actually work. Study from Cornell found that couples with planned reunion dates reported significantly lower anxiety and higher relationship satisfaction.

Your brain needs something concrete to look forward to. ""I'll see you when I can"" keeps you in limbo. ""I'm booking flights for March 15th"" gives you a countdown, something to plan around, a light at the end of the tunnel.

Also, alternate who visits. Don't make one person do all the travel. That breeds resentment fast.

**When it's actually time to quit**

Some LDRs shouldn't work. Not every relationship is meant to survive distance and that's not a failure.

Red flags nobody talks about: one person doing all the emotional labor, the distance becoming an excuse to avoid deeper issues, using ""when we're together"" as a fantasy escape from addressing real incompatibilities.

The book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine is essential reading here. Insanely good for understanding if your attachment styles are compatible long term or if you're just prolonging the inevitable. It won the Science of Relationships award and breaks down why some couples thrive in distance while others spiral.

I have had absolutely life ruining crippling anxiety and panic attacks for about two years. I had ruminating disturbing thoughts I could not combat despite CBT therapy, EMDR therapy, exercise, and trying selexa, Prozac, buspar, and propranolol before. I was taking Xanax twice a week and started missing work and relying on ambien to get out of my cycles of not sleeping due to being up panicking. It was a nightmare.

I started taking half a 25mg Zoloft in the evenings and had 1.5 weeks of intense nausea, increased anxiety, stomach issues, and intrusive suicidal thoughts. Then I went to the full 25 and started having insomnia (waking up around 3 and then continuing to not sleep). I also experienced a lot of depression and lack of energy. I stayed on 25 mg for 5 weeks (so 6 weeks of Zoloft total).

Once I went up to 50mg (1 week ago) I felt almost immediate relief. I felt energy, motivated to do things, anxiety 95% gone. I can tell my brain has some patterns that it’s still getting out of but I no longer have a physical response to those intrusive thoughts and so they are subsiding more and more and are no longer disrupting my life. I have slept every night fine since the dose increase. I did feel kind of high for a few days (I’d call it like taking a Xanax and drinking a big coffee kind of feeling) and still do a little bit for a couple hours taking it but it’s not unpleasant just buzzy. Then the rest of the day I no longer feel drugged like I did while weaning onto the Zoloft I just feel NORMAL.

I was so worried that being on an anxiety med would dull me or make me so drugged that I just didn’t have anxiety anymore, but I truly just feel normal again. It’s been one week of success. I’ll return and update once I’m further down the road.

If you’re struggling with the side effects of getting on the med, hang in there. That’s what I read over and over on here and it motivated me to push through and I’m so glad I did.

Looking for most westernized city and lifestyle possible. Am a white gay guy.,"Hi all, I am an M7 MBA grad currently working at a tech startup. I am a white gay guy from America.

My company is offering me a promotion with a significant pay bump, but it requires relocating to India for at least 6 months and up to one year to help build out our teams there. After that, I'd go back to America. 

We are definitely building one team in Mumbai. I also have flexibility to build a second team either in Mumbai or another city like Bangalore or Hyderabad. I can live anywhere in India as long as I travel to Mumbai occasionally if I am not based there.

I am not going to sugarcoat this or be PC. I have basically zero interest in assimilating into or immersing myself in authentic Indian culture.

I enjoy chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic naan, and some Goa trance music. I know chicken tikka masala is apparently British. I strongly dislike most Bollywood music, and most Bollywood movies I have seen felt pretty dumb. I liked 3 Idiots and Lagaan, but that is about it.

What I want is to maintain as much of a progressive, western first lifestyle as possible.

That means wearing American or western clothes, getting by with English only, not having to speak Hindi or regional languages, access to LGBTQ or gay bars and clubs, nightlife with EDM DJs or American pop rather than Bollywood music, cocktail bars and lounges, and a strong cosmopolitan food scene with nice sit down restaurants beyond just traditional Indian food.

Women’s rights and general social development matter a lot to me. I want areas where western norms are more common. Ideally places where PDA like holding hands is more accepted. Same with a place where casual sex, hookup culture, and western-style dating apps like Grindr, Hinge, or Bumble are commonplace.

On a platonic note, places with strong mixed-gender socializing and friendships are important to me. Same with areas where ambitious, career-oriented women are supported. Where it's socially okay to not want kids as a married couple.

Bonus points if there are western style coffee shops, comedy clubs, rock music venues, jazz clubs, or even a western style symphony orchestra. The orchestra part is not mandatory but would be great.

I also want to be around movie theaters that play western films in English, and around people who watch western TV shows. Korean movies and shows are cool too.

I am fine checking out some temples occasionally, maybe seeing a bhangra performance, and I definitely want to travel for fun to places like Jaipur and Udaipur for architecture, and Goa for beaches. I have heard Goa has a lot of foreigners and expats, which is appealing.

Overall though, I am explicitly looking for an inauthentic western lifestyle bubble. I am totally fine being in a bubble and engaging with local culture on my own terms rather than being surrounded by it daily.

Given all that, which city or neighborhoods would you recommend I seriously consider for living? Mumbai vs Bangalore vs Hyderabad or somewhere else entirely?

Would appreciate honest takes from people who have lived or worked there, especially expats. Thanks in advance.",30,1769449205.0,MBA,28,0.69,False

Sometimes she struggles walking up and I have to wake her up. Then we drive together for work, I drop her off then drive on to my own workplace close by.

I have discussed with her previously that I don't want to feel responsible for her getting up in time for work and she agreed. I have also said that I would love a more flexible schedule than our current, as my job allows me flexible hours, but since she is a teacher she has to get to work at specific hours.

Today I slept poorly, she did too, and approx 1-2 hours earlier than usually I got up, and after making coffee I took the buss to work. I figured it was either that, and get home early, or just kill time doing nothing and get back the usual time. Maybe I could get more time to wind down..? The car was available for her, and I texted her ""I got up early and took the buss, the cats are fed"", then proceeded with my day.

However she slept through her alarms and was woken up by a college calling her. This is the first time it happened, but ofcourse she panicked and stressed her way to work.

When we discussed what has happened she said she felt extremely betrayed by me. I pointed out our previous discussions, but she said she needed a proper warning first. I said I saw her view, but that I felt I had done no wrong.

In the end I do feel like she has put some emotional responsibility on me that she gets to work in time. I don't feel like I should have that responsibility, she's an adult, what if I wasn't there? Would she not be able to get up and lose her job?

Or perhaps our previous discussions were not enough to prepare her for me to spontaneously leave for work when it suited me best? 

My feeling is that at some level, we're not responsible for each other, rather we are responsible to be a stable partner for each other, and should function properly on our own too...

I'm currently scratching my head on an issue and have gotten to the point that I don't think I can figure it out on my own. The short version is that a friend and I both have the exact same setup but need wildly different grind settings.

What's the same:

* 1zpresso J-Ultra
* Cafelat Robot with pressure gauge
* Beans from the same roaster/lot
   * Phil & Sebastian sample sets in light and medium roast
* Water directly off boil, no preheat

What's different:

* With three of the four light roasts so far, I have gotten the following results:
   * 18g in, 40g out
   * Grind size in the 85-95 range
   * Preinfuse at 1-2 bar for 12 seconds
   * Pull up to 8 bar then decline through the shot
   * Shot completes in 25-35 seconds
* When she tries pulling a shot:
   * Grind size of 100 on a set of beans that I did at 92 (which to me says it should be like a 15-20s shot all other things being equal)
   * Can't get a saturated portafilter bottom at low pressure
   * Three full minutes at 10 bar to get 40g out

What we've tried:

* Clean and recalibrate grinders to the same zero point.
* Three different sets of beans from the same lots.

But I'm kind of at a loss for what other variables there are. Next step will be to just dial her in to what works for her grinder on these light roasts (guessing somewhere around 120 maybe more), but that seems like a wild discrepancy for what is supposed to be a very high quality grinder. Especially with only 50g each of these coffees, the hope was for me (who has been doing light roast espresso for a while) to be able to share good working grind sizes to her (who is new to espresso in general) to get a head start on dialing in.

Any thoughts on any variables I could be missing here? Should ""identical"" grinders be that far out of alignment? Any thoughts or feedback are welcome. Thanks!",1,1769449093.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1qnmtuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qnmtuy/the_psychology_of_attraction_do_you_actually_like/,The Psychology of Attraction: Do You Actually Like Them? (Even If You Don't Think So),"I spent months convincing myself I wasn't into someone. Then one random Tuesday at 2am, I caught myself smiling at their text like an idiot. That's when it hit me: I'd been lying to myself the entire time.

This happens way more than we think. I've been diving deep into attachment research, psychology podcasts, and honestly, just watching my friends be absolute disasters in the dating world. What I found? Most of us are walking around with zero clue about our actual feelings. We're either in denial, scared, or just emotionally constipated from years of protecting ourselves.

Here's what helped me figure out if I actually liked someone (spoiler: the signs were SCREAMING at me):

**Your body knows before your brain does**

* You get weirdly nervous before seeing them. Like, checking your reflection multiple times nervous.
* Their name pops up on your phone and there's this tiny adrenaline spike. Not huge, just... something.
* You find yourself fixing your hair or adjusting your clothes when they're around. Subconscious peacocking is real.

This isn't just rom-com BS. In *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (both Columbia psychiatrists, and this book is basically the bible for understanding why we're all so weird about relationships), they explain how our nervous system reacts to people we're drawn to before our conscious mind catches up. Your body is literally giving you spoilers about your feelings. The book breaks down attachment styles in a way that'll make you go ""OH THAT'S WHY I'M LIKE THIS."" Genuinely one of those reads that makes you want to text your ex and apologize, then immediately block them again.

**You're curating your personality around them**

* You suddenly care about topics you never gave a damn about before because THEY care about them.
* You're filtering what you say, trying to be the ""cool"" version of yourself. Exhausting but you keep doing it.
* You notice yourself telling stories differently, funnier, more interesting when they're in the room.

Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett talks about this in her emotion research. We construct feelings through our behaviors and social cues, not the other way around. If you're performing for someone, that's your brain screaming ""PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PERSON.""

The podcast *Where Should We Begin* with Esther Perel has this episode where a guy insists he's ""just friends"" with someone while literally describing every micro-behavior that screams attraction. Perel (legendary couples therapist) basically calls him out in the gentlest but most devastating way possible. Worth a listen if you're currently lying to yourself.

**You're doing mental gymnastics to justify seeing them**

* ""I'm just going to this party because Sarah will be there"" but really it's because THEY might show up.
* You volunteer for random stuff you'd normally avoid. Group projects? Suddenly yes.
* You have elaborate explanations for why you texted them at midnight about something that could've waited.

I started using this app called **Finch** to track my daily moods and it was wild seeing the pattern. Every day I saw this person, my mood rating was higher. The app is basically a self care pet game that helps you build awareness about what actually affects your emotional state. Sounds dorky but it made the pattern OBVIOUS.

If books like *Attached* clicked for you, there's this AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls from all these psychology sources, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it lets you customize the depth and length of what you're learning. You can do a quick 10-minute summary on attachment styles or go deep into a 40-minute dive with real examples and context. 

What's cool is you can type in something specific like ""understanding my attachment patterns in dating"" and it'll generate a podcast tailored to exactly that, pulling from books, studies, and expert interviews. There's also this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your specific situation, which honestly sounds less cringe than it is. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic one that makes learning about emotional vulnerability way less painful.

**The ""would I care if they dated someone else"" test**

This one's brutal but effective. Imagine them posting a photo with someone new, all couple-y. If your stomach drops even a little? Yeah. You like them.

Most people fail this test spectacularly. We'll be like ""no I'm totally fine with them dating other people"" and then spiral for three days when we see them with someone at a party.

**You remember weird details about them**

* Their coffee order, their sister's name, that story about their childhood dog.
* You know their schedule without trying. Just casually aware they have that meeting on Thursdays.
* Random things remind you of them constantly. A song, a meme, a specific type of weather.

In *The Science of Likability* (author Patrick King breaks down social psychology research in actually readable language), he explains that we subconsciously prioritize information about people we're attracted to. Your brain is literally filing away everything about them like you're building a dossier. 

**Here's the thing nobody tells you:** denying your feelings doesn't make them go away. It just makes you weird and confusing to be around. I spent so long pretending I wasn't into someone that I accidentally friend-zoned myself into oblivion.

Look, our brains are messy. We've been conditioned to protect ourselves, to play it cool, to not seem desperate or clingy. Society throws all this garbage at us about playing hard to get and not catching feelings too fast. Then we end up emotionally constipated, unable to recognize basic attraction because we're so busy performing indifference.

The good news? Once you start paying attention to these patterns, it gets easier to be honest with yourself. You don't have to DO anything about it right away. Just acknowledge it. Sit with it. Stop gaslighting yourself about your own feelings.

Your feelings are information, not instructions. You can like someone and still choose not to pursue it. You can be attracted to someone and recognize it's not the right timing. But at least you're being real with yourself instead of doing this exhausting performance of indifference while your body is literally screaming the truth.

Under one of the tables was a beautiful dove, nothing like I've ever seen. She had colourful feathers on her head and neck, and her body was a lovely ashy grey/brown. I was worried for her because she shouldn't have been trapped inside. There was an old man in the room and I forgot what he said but it prompted me to remove my hoodie to try and wrap around the dove. I told him I could wash my hoodie afterwards. As I approached the bird she suddenly turned into a cat! Similar colours in similar places, though she looked more like a calico. I was shocked. I was still worried about the cat because we couldn't keep animals at the shelter. I'm not sure what happened but I remember leaving the room and heading for the elevator. I tried pushing the button to call the elevator but I was clumsy and pushed a button that stopped the elevator. Someone was inside and she was upset. Eventually the doors did open and I spoke to the woman inside the elevator. I told her what happened and she told me that the old man used an ai illusion. I remember thinking that was strange cause ai doesn't work in real life like that.

I'm curious about the themes of being back at the homeless shelter, seeing a dove turn into a cat, wanting to help this animal, the accusation of ai.

The second dream I was at a friend's house. For some reason my plants were there, on a coffee table in the living room. But one was missing. My friend was supposed to be caring for them but he said he didn't know what happened. I remember being frustrated cause how do you lose a plant? Something that can't move on its own. I also remember lamenting that this is the second plant my friend lost. I remember at one point showing a photo of a similar plant to someone saying, ""This is what it looks like."" So I go looking for my plant and I find it in a corner by an outlet. In the outlet was a Virgin Mary nightlight. It was turned on despite it being day. I remember thinking I needed to take both my plant and the nightlight home.     

The plants missing in my dream were an arrowhead/syngonium, and a small monstera. The small monstera was the one I found by the nightlight.

For this one I'm curious about the themes of plants, them being lost, me finding it in a corner that didn't have sunlight but had the Virgin Mary nightlight that \*was\* lit. My desire to bring home both the ""lost"" plant (leaving the others behind) and the nightlight.",1,1769449030.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

My main influences are:

* He Who Fights With Monsters (sardonic voice)
* Azarinth Healer (solo survival grind)
* Elden Ring (atmosphere)

Two angles I'm considering are:

>**Version A (lighter, dark humor)**  
All one wants is to wake up at a reasonable hour, have coffee, and come to terms with today.  
For Velos, this is not going to happen. Instead: murder cats, a dungeon far above his level, and a System that thinks ""Early Bird"" is a suitable achievement for not dying before breakfast.  
He enters this new world with time-bending abilities and pajamas. Dark humor will keep him mostly sane between bloody encounters.  
He will soon realize that survival is optional — momentum is not.  
His reward? Stunning vistas and unexpected allies.  
His motto: Experience doesn't need to be pleasant if it is intense enough.

>**Version B (darker, pressure-driven)**  
Velos expected morning.  
He did not expect a dungeon far beyond his limits, predators that shouldn't exist, and a System that measures survival in seconds.  
Armed with unstable time-bending abilities and a sense of humor that refuses to die, he pushes forward anyway. Because in this world, hesitation kills.  
As the land twists and allies emerge, Velos begins to realize that pushing too hard doesn't go unnoticed. Pressure invites response, and some threats are already leaning closer.  
Survival can be negotiated.  
Momentum cannot.  
Public Test Realm is a progression fantasy about pressure, adaptation, and what happens when your actions force the System to act.

Not promoting—work is in early stages. But honestly have no idea which tone would land better with the targeted audience.

If either blurb hooks you enough to want a look at the opening chapter, happy to share privately. But mainly here for gut reactions.

Does either work for you? Would you scroll past both?",0,1769449007.0,ProgressionFantasy,2,0.33,False

My family and I had food from Sattara yesterday and from Ulsavam today, and I am just sharing my experience with both the restaurants.

  
**Sattara, Opp to KSRTC Bus Stand**  
2 Ghee Podi Masala Dosa(170 each), 2 BenneMasala Dosa(170 each), 4 coffee(40 each)  
The ambience was good although it felt chaotic to find a seat especially for a family, and food was ok. But apart from that all are negative. Pricing is on the costlier side, that too unnecessarily costly. They are trying to bring the Bengaluru style restaurant here, but there are many restaurants in Bengaluru with more quanitity and less price than this restaurant, and the price of food can't be justified at all. The food was ok and the chutneys and sambar quantity provided were very less. The washroom area felt very cramped Also the parking can accomodate 15 vehicles at max, but its a big hassle to get our vehicle out from there as its near KSRTC and we are gonna create a big road block while exiting the restaurant. And I dont think for a restaurant of self service should price their items at this extent. The staffs attitude felt like we are having food for free and the coffee/tea master's hygiene was questionable as he was rubbing his face with bare hands and wiping his nose with his T-shirt and then without washing his hands, he was serving tea and coffee to the customers.  


**Ulsavam, Near New Bus Stand**  
1 Ghee Roast(125), 2 Mysore Masala Dosa(145 each), 1 Masala Dosa(135), 4 filter coffee(45 each)  
Apart from the filter coffee, which felt a bit watered down, everything about this restaurant was very good. This restaurant does justify its pricing as it felt more premium, more spacing and a very good service. The washroom area was very good, and the staff informed today that they are gonna increase the space in the coming month as they are opening seating upstairs too. There's valet parking and every staff there are very friendly and open to hear feedback too. Also their menu seems very good for veg food lovers, there are many dishes which are not commonly seen in Veg restaurants in Kerala.

Now coming to my point, I dont understand why Satara is crowded from the day it was launched, today too when I passed there, but Ulsavam on the other hand, was less crowded.  
If anybody doesn't know about this restaurant, do check it out and share your feedback about these restaurants.

I think Satara has the worst service in the city, even worse than Kubaba at the moment.",10,1769448990.0,kozhikode,8,1.0,False

Been single for a while and figured to give dating another shot. Valentine’s is also just right around the corner and I wouldn’t mind spending it with someone romantically here in Iloilo City but I am also open to remain friends if that’s more of the vibe we’re both getting from each other. No hard feelings here. :)

About Me:

• I help coach (an assistant coach for newbie athletes) and I’m also an entrepreneur.

• I work out and train 5-6x a week in my chosen sports.

• I highly enjoy night rides and midnight food trips!

• I love going on solo trips and cafe hunting (if you like traveling and the gym, we might get along pretty well!)

• I love matcha. Sorry. Stopped drinking coffee years ago but a dirty matcha here and there would be alright with me. Still, I am very much open to matcha-coffee dates!

• 5’1 ft and I have an athletic built due to my sports and gym time. I naturally have broad shoulders too. Black hair, brown eyes and I’m mestiza (so I’ve been told by others lol)

About You:

•5’9-6ft would be ideal. Just a personal preference but I’m okay if you’re a bit shorter. Like 5’7 lol.

•Athletic, does sports and values health as well. :)

•Loves traveling and night rides too.

•Personal preference of 28-33 for the age. Yes, I prefer older men. But 26 would be fine too. No worries.

•Also looking for a genuine connection.

•I don’t mind the type of work that you do especially if you’re in med, law or corporate just as long as you can openly communicate.

•Respectful and understanding.

•Mestizo or light tan preferably. Again, just a personal physical preference of mine in men. :)

That’s about it. If you think my post peaks your interest, please send me a DM about yourself. I will not be entertaining messages with just a simple “hi” or “hello”. Witty intros and puns usually catch my attention the fastest btw.

I had a lot of cool experiences growing up. One of the experiences I had was when Nan opened the door to her house and took in a foreign exchange student from Slovakia for five years as he studied at Villanova. Daniel became a brother to me and even after he moved to NYC in 1996, he would visit every weekend. When he moved to LA in 1998, the visits became less frequent, but we still keep in touch. Today is his 49th birthday.

I wrote these two pieces for the chapbook I wrote in 2013. I loved Saturday mornings. Yeah, I started drinking Starbucks at the tender age of 6...

Suzy Jo Donuts Love

Cruising along Dekalb Pike at 50 miles,
the road sign reads 40; our hearts race;
my hair is a mess as the cool wind blows
through the opened windows and sunroof
of your brand new Volkswagen Jetta, a sleek black.
We pretend this is the Autobahn with the speed,
as you watch the road and I watch the sun
rise above the small building of Suzy Jo's.
You ease the Jetta to a halt and I fix my hair,
and give you a toothless smile;
as a seven year old, this is my favorite day.
We walk inside, sugar scent fill the air,
""glazed and chocolate,"" I scream out,
my favorites as the lady asks us what we want.
""I'll take two glazed, a cruller...""
we walk out with a box of about 6 donuts
just ready to be eaten as we watch cartoons.

Starbucks Love

""Starbucks will go perfectly with our donuts,""
you say to me as we pull into Starbuck's—
Dekalb Pike is still quiet, it's 9am on a Saturday.
Yet inside, the place is busy, the hustle and bustle
of people and baristas. They are dizzying, mesmerizing,
but friendly, talkative, and are very accommodating.
You order a grande coffee, black, just like in Europe
and you order me a tall coffee, which seemed huge to me.
In the store, we left my coffee black and sugarless
only to be filled with some cream
(as I'm lactose intolerant and a lot of cream is bad)
and lots of white sugar. I wrinkle my nose at the strength,
you and nan both laugh at me, but I love the coffee
and dipping my glazed donut inside of it.

I can’t grind any finer with my Eureka Mignon (2 years old, modded with the espresso blades) without choking out my machine. I’m getting 36g in approximately 27-30 seconds with my dial on 0.5 and 18g in my Normcore basket. 

Prep is a shaken doing cup, then WDT with a Normcore - upgraded recently because I realized my original WDT’s straight needles weren’t cutting it - in small circles from bottom to top, leveler, then tamp with the spring-loaded self-leveling Normcore tamper. I double check space with the Breville razor tool. 

I’ve tried the puck screen, but it’s hard to get the portafilter in if I use it. 

Current beans are from a local roaster in my town, 1 week old at first use, they are now 3 weeks old. 

The spray is making me crazy with the mess. The taste is honestly pretty good to my admittedly not very educated palette, but even my coffee hating partner has said that my current shots are tasting good. So much so that they’re asking for lattes. So I can’t be ruining the shots too badly!

Been single for a while and figured to give dating another shot. Valentine’s is also just right around the corner and I wouldn’t mind spending it with someone romantically but I am also open to remain friends if that’s more of the vibe we’re both getting from each other. No hard feelings here. :)

About Me:

• I help coach (an assistant coach for newbie athletes) and I’m also an entrepreneur.

• I work out and train 5-6x a week in my chosen sports.

• I highly enjoy night rides and midnight food trips!

• I love going on solo trips and cafe hunting (if you like traveling and the gym, we might get along pretty well!)

• I love matcha. Sorry. Stopped drinking coffee years ago but a dirty matcha here and there would be alright with me. Still, I am very much open to matcha-coffee dates!

•5’1 ft and I have an athletic built due to my sports and gym time. I naturally have broad shoulders too. Black hair, brown eyes and I’m mestiza (so I’ve been told by others lol)

About You:

•5’9-6ft would be ideal. Just a personal preference but I’m okay if you’re a bit shorter. Like 5’7 lol.

•Athletic, does sports and values health as well. :)

•Loves traveling and night rides too.

•Personal preference of 28-33 for the age. Yes, I prefer older men. But 26 would be fine too. No worries.

•Also looking for a genuine connection.

•I don’t mind the type of work that you do especially if you’re in med, law or corporate just as long as you can openly communicate.

•Respectful and understanding.

•Mestizo or light tan preferably. Again, just a personal physical preference of mine in men. :)

That’s about it. If you think my post peaks your interest, please send me a DM about yourself. I will not be entertaining messages with just a simple “hi” or “hello”. Witty intros and puns usually catch my attention the fastest btw.

Hope you all have a goodnight/early morning! ✨",2,1769448379.0,SwipeRightIloilo,0,1.0,False

1qnmi6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1qnmi6c/i_dont_see_a_way_out_anymore/,I don’t see a way out anymore.,"I want to start this by saying that I understand it’s not just me in this situation, I don’t know what’s happening in the world but I know that millions of people are living in poverty.

I’m from the UK but Im now living in Costa Rica. Technically its cheaper for me to live here, you can live a decent life here with very little income but the problem I have now is that no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to make any money at all.

Ive always worked hard, I started work at the age of 13 and have experience across customer service and operations, I even have a green belt in lean six sigma and Ive worked in Managerial roles. But after having to work 70hrs a week during covid because I wasn’t fortunate enough to have been furloughed so I had to pick up night shift stacking shelves in Tesco I wanted a change. Like most people at that time, it made me think there has to be more to life than this. 

So I sold everything and moved to costa rica, I did  a TEFL course so I could teach english online from anywhere in the world - at the time that sounded like a dream. But what they dont tell you is that teaching online is very low pay and an unsustainable income. I actually realised pretty quickly that I didn’t even want to teach but I had no choice to do it and made it work. 

A year ago, I was working around 45hrs per week and only making $1000pm. I say only - its really not that money for the amount hours I put in BUT I could afford my bills, live comfortably and enjoy a treat at the weekend. 

But come late june last year and my students started dropping off for the summer holidays - all with the promise of a return. July I had lost over 50% of my students and just about paid my rent that month. But August I only had 2 students for the entire month and I couldn’t pay my full rent, having to use what little savings I had to pay the outstanding. September was the same except now I was in debt. October I got some students back and I was scrambling to pay my sept debt on-top of still not having all my students back.

Then middle of november it happened again, this time all students disappearing for christmas. I had no choice but to move house to an open plan ‘ranch style’ as they put it, in the middle of nowhere in the mountains, I am completely isolated here with just me and my dog and no car. The nearest grocery store is a 30min hike away. The ranch style house is open plan with only the bedroom having walls and a door. The whole ‘house’ is sat on wooden slats resting on pallets and even the toilet is balancing on one plank of wood with nothing underneath but a drop. I don’t have any privacy with the open sides which means I daily have to deal with walking into spider webs that go from one end of the room to the other, last week I had a snake in my kitchen, every week I have scorpians and even a brazilian wandering spider at one point, I have to escort cane toads out of my living room every night whilst locking ny dog in the only room with a door so he wont try get the cane toads, I have no gas, the water is pumped up from the river nearby, the landlord has clearly never rented before because he has been in my space and used my stuff and moved things around whilst Ive been hiking to the grocery store, he took a wardrobe from the house and later text to say his daughter needed it, along with pots and pans also taken. I set boundaries with him and he since ignores me completely. My nervous sustem is on high alert here and whilst the surrounding area is breathtakingly beautiful, I cannot relax. 

But you get what you pay for and for $200pm I have to accept it.

Thing is we are now heading into february and I only have 6 students. I cant afford my rent due next week let alone any food. I have been living on plain rice and coffee with 2 sugars for the past few weeks. My dog on just rice and kibble. 

Aside from not getting any new students even though ive lowered my rate and offered discounted packages, I tried the side hustles and now have pdfs, online courses and prints for sale on payhip, gumroad and kdp but haven’t made a single sale. Ive run out of connects on upwork to apply for gigs and cant afford to buy more. I only receive scam messages on my fiver account and Ive applied to close to 500 jobs since june and just get ghosted. Ive only had 1 interview which was an ai interview to do data entry online and i was rejected for that.

My kickstarter campaign made no sales and my go fund me raised $20 which thankfully bought me some food that week.

Ive worked hard my whole life and I am very ambitious, I started working at the age of 13, ive had 2 businesses which both failed, ive bootstrapped the entire ux design for a business thats ive had to put on hold because i cant afford the development, ive applied to investors 32 times and been rejected. I applied to teach on different teaching platforms nd got rejected there too.

When I sold everything in the UK, i also paid off all my debt so now I have a low credit rating and cant get a loan or credit card.

No one can say I am not trying. I am trying so hard but every door seems to close on me and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t afford to get back to the UK and even if I did, the country is in an economic crisis and id end up homeless anyway. 

I come from a broken home, I don’t have any family and very few friends that I can talk to, even they don’t know the truth of my what Im dealing with. 

I don’t know what to do. But Im scared shitless that Im going to be homeless here in a foreign country and have to give up my dog is breaking my heart. 

Im not someone who wants to so nothing, I want to work. I enjoy working and learning. I just wish someone would give me a chance because Im rapidly losing all my self confidence and feeling like Im drowning.",4,1769448373.0,povertyfinance,1,1.0,False
1qnmha6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qnmha6/i_got_a_bad_reviewshould_i_email_her_privately/,I got a bad review—should I email her privately?,"I’m a designer. Today I got a bad review from a client that I let go two months ago. In 11 years I have never let a client go. 

I wrote a public and professional response to her bad review but I want to write a private email. 

I should mention this woman is a little…emotionally unregulated. She’s not rational. She was traumatized by her mother who was an interior designer and told her everything she liked was ugly (in not so many words). When I told her a piece she liked was dated it triggered an emotional tsunami that I have never seen. She’s incredibly nice initially but she got real nasty after this happened. 

But everything in me wants to send this email privately. Tell me if it’s a bad idea or if there’s a better way to phrase what I said. I’m mad so I know I’m not thinking straight:

“Hi \[Ex-Client\],

I wanted to write you privately regarding your review. Most of my projects last 6 months to a year so it’s unfortunate that you decided that after just 3 weeks of working together you would drag my small business. 

I want to touch on some things that were said during our last call. 

During our phone conversation you had said you had wished we had coffee together prior to meeting as you never would have hired me (paraphrasing). 

You also said you knew (again, I'm paraphrasing as it's been 2 months) you would not like any other designs that I created for you. 

Under normal circumstances I would go through the revisions process and come back with alternative designs. But do you think that it would have been a good idea for us to continue working after the things you shared with me? 

And the sad part is you liked 7 or 8 of the items I selected. But you told me you hated it all at the end of our phone call and that I had not been listening to you. 

I am sorry that things worked out the way they did. Usually I would work hard to make sure you're happy but you already stated you planned to not be happy with anything I did. 

I hope you give future business owners the benefit of the doubt. I am happy you found a designer that was able to work with you and create a design you like. I wish you the best of luck with everything. “",1,1769448323.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I had left home a few minutes early and stopped for coffee in Green Bay on my way for a job interview. On my way back to my car I tripped and spilled my coffee on my nicest dress shirt. I still had some time so I jumped in my car to rush home and get a clean one. But wouldn't you know my luck, my car wouldn't start. 

My head dropped into my arms on my steering wheel. I knew the day was ruined before it started. 

Then the knock on my window. It was Adam Stenovich! 

I rolled down my window and he asked me what was wrong. I explained to him the whole situation, and he sprung into action! 

Immediately he game me the shirt of his back. Absolutely incredible move and I'm so lucky we were the same size! He hands me his hot coffee, and looks me dead in the eye and says ""that's for you!"" Then, while jump starting my car he gives me the most motivating pre-interview speech I ever heard! I was ready to go on offense and show these interviewers I'm the best candidate they got! 

Wouldn't ya know, after the interview they gave me the job on the spot. Went over to Krolls with the boys to celebrate. Adam was there with orphans taking them out for a dinner, and he came over and bought the first round for us!

His life is routine—7-Eleven coffee, the same truck he's driven for years, a job at a metal shop run by a woman who's become more family than boss. He doesn't do surprises. He doesn't do complicated. He definitely doesn't do ancient artifacts that won't let him put them down.

When a mysterious package arrives at the shop—addressed to Jake, ordered by no one—Jake makes the mistake of opening it. Inside is a metal disc, cold in a way that defies physics, humming at a frequency he feels in his teeth. Within days, he can't sleep. Can't think. Can't stop carrying the thing everywhere he goes.

Then he discovers his boss's late husband received the same artifact twenty years ago. It led him to Egypt. He never came back the same.

Now Jake is on a plane to Cairo, following a dead man's journal into a world of underground labyrinths, competing factions, and secrets that have been buried for longer than human civilization. Everyone wants what's hidden beneath the Egyptian desert. Everyone thinks Jake is the key to getting it.

He's starting to think they might be right.

**About the book:**

The Key That Hums is the first book in a planned 7-book series (Cycle of Ruin). It's a conspiracy thriller with ancient mystery elements—think The Da Vinci Code meets The Martian, with a blue-collar protagonist who survives through observation and adaptation rather than destiny or superpowers. The tone balances tension with gallows humor.

The manuscript is complete and just shy of 90,000 words. This is my debut novel.

**Content warnings:**

Violence, some strong language, peril. No explicit sexual content.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm recruiting 15-20 beta readers. I'm most interested in:

* **Pacing** — Were there sections that dragged or felt rushed?
* **Character engagement** — Did you connect with Jake? Did you root for him?
* **Clarity** — Any points where you felt confused about what was happening?
* **Immersion breaks** — Anything that pulled you out of the story?
* **Overall experience** — Would you read Book 2?

You don't need to provide a detailed editorial critique—gut reactions, highlights, and problem spots are exactly what I need.

**Timeline:**

I'd love feedback within **4 weeks**. I'm on a fast production schedule, so timely responses are appreciated.

**Delivery:**

I'm using BetaBooks to manage the process. Once you sign up, I'll send an invite to your email. You can read in-browser or on mobile and leave comments directly in the manuscript.

1qnm919,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1qnm919/dp_falkenstein_grand_autograph_collection_near/,"DP: Falkenstein Grand (Autograph Collection) near Frankfurt, Germany. Nice hardware, but surprisingly poor elite recognition, service & communication","Stayed one night at the Falkenstein Grand (Autograph Collection) as Titanium and came away a bit disappointed, mainly due to service and communication rather than the physical product.

Two days before arrival I requested late check-out (4 pm) both via the app and by replying to the hotel’s personal pre-arrival email. Never received any response. At check-in I was simply told late check-out was “not possible” and only subject to availability, with no explanation or acknowledgement of my prior requests.

No alternative was offered, no apology, and not even a suggestion to check again the next morning. The conversation felt very transactional, especially for a hotel marketing itself as 5-star superior.

Benefits were minimal: 1,000 points and breakfast. No welcome amenity beyond a small bottle of water and juice.

The property itself is actually quite nice: beautiful location, good rooms, pleasant spa with outdoor heated pool, and breakfast quality was high. But service felt unstructured throughout the stay – plenty of staff, yet slow or reactive rather than attentive (long waits at tea time, empty water/tea stations in the spa, breakfast orders mixed up, etc.).

What bothered me most wasn’t the missing benefit itself, but the lack of communication. Even after contacting Marriott support, the front desk seemed unaware of any complaint. After departure the hotel offered coffee and cake for a future stay, but never really addressed the original issue.

Bottom line: nice hardware and setting, but the service culture didn’t match the positioning. As a Titanium, it felt like my presence made no difference. For now, not somewhere I’d go out of my way to return.",0,1769447851.0,marriott,2,0.5,False

Then comes the dragging fatigue the next day, the foggy brain, the cravings, the anxiety. This cycle is so normalized that people think it’s just adulthood. But it’s not. It’s poor sleep. And yes, it’s fixable.



This post is a breakdown of the most life-changing sleep advice from Dr. Matthew Walker (author of Why We Sleep, top neuroscientist at UC Berkeley), plus peer-reviewed research and legitimate science-backed tips. No fluff, just what works.



1. Treat sleep like a non-negotiable meeting.



Dr. Walker says the number one mistake people make is treating sleep as optional. Sleep is literally the foundation of physical and mental health. A 2017 study in Sleep Health showed that even one hour less sleep per night increases the risk of anxiety, depression, and weakened immunity. Sleep isn’t a luxury, it’s maintenance.



2. Go to bed and wake up at the same time, even on weekends.



It sounds annoying but it works. The consistency trains the suprachiasmatic nucleus in your brain to regulate melatonin. This internal rhythm is fragile. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that inconsistent sleep and wake times are linked to lower cognitive performance and increased cortisol levels. Yes, weekend sleep-ins mess it up big time.



3. Lower your core body temperature. Seriously.



Sleep onset is triggered by a drop in core temperature. A warm shower at night helps because it dilates blood vessels and cools you down afterwards. Research from the University of Texas at Austin found that a warm bath 1-2 hours before bed can improve sleep efficiency by 10%.



4. Kill the blue light 90 minutes before bed.



Your phone is basically sabotaging your melatonin. Harvard Medical School research shows blue light suppresses melatonin twice as long as other wavelengths and shifts circadian rhythms by up to 3 hours. That’s why scrolling at night feels good but wrecks you the next day.



5. Caffeine after 2 PM? Don’t.



Caffeine has a quarter-life of 12 hours. That means your 3 PM coffee still affects your brain at 3 AM. A study in Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that caffeine taken even 6 hours before bedtime reduces total sleep time by over 1 hour.



6. Don’t just fix sleep to feel rested. Fix it to boost your memory, immune system, and even attractiveness.



This sounds fake, but it’s in the data. Dr. Walker’s lab found that sleep-deprived individuals are perceived as less attractive and less healthy. Sleep strengthens memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and immune function.

Monsters Inc:

Alice in Wonderland:

I never received Alice’s perfume, so the quest can’t continue, and I also have weird/glitched items in my inventory (I’ll attach a photo).

Prep:

Overweight so the doctor had me do a 2-day liquid diet. Started Saturday and went all day with water, coffee, Gatorade and some jello. Saturday night I took 2 ducolax and 2 gas-x.

Sunday started out the same as the day before with all liquids. 3pm a took the first bottle of Clenpiq prep solution. Continued with the liquids and from 4-6 only had 3-4l trips to the bathroom. Honestly was expecting more, but not complaining. No need to explain the visuals of the trips, unless asked...lol

Sunday night at 8pm was another 2 gas-x pills and the 2nd bottle of Clenpiq solution. This time I probably doubled my trips compared to the first. Laid down in bed just after 11pm and was able to get a few hours sleep. 

Monday (today) woke up at 4am with the urge to go. Spent a couple hours this morning getting the last bit out. Showered and at the doctor's office at 9am for a 9:30am procedure. 

The procedure itself was the easy part. Get in bed, IV, sedation and off to dreamland. Was under for maybe 30-40 minutes, woke up and was gone by 10:30am. 

Results:

4 polyps (4mm-7mm) in Cecum and Asending Colon

1 polyp (10mm) in Sigmoid Colon

Mild diverticulitis of Sigmoid Colon

Everything is out to pathology and have a follow-up appointment in 3 weeks to go over the results. 

Next colonoscopy is in 3 years.

Overall it wasn't a bad experience. Was stressing about 2 days no food but it wasn't that bad. I was hungry, but not ""oh my god, I'm going to eat my arm hungry"". Also thought I was going to be on the toilet way more than I was. I did a low dose prep, so maybe that has something to do with it.",2,1769447692.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

First time ko mag rant dito so please be kind.

Is it valid ba na makaramdam ako ng anger and jealousy right now??? My girlfriend went out with her friends today to have coffee. Ang problem is may friends siya na hindi ko talaga gusto because ever since naging kami marami na silang sinasabing bad things about me and parang they were trying to break us apart. May past issue na na backstab nila ako and naging malaking problema siya sa relationship namin.

I already told my girlfriend na hindi ako comfortable sa mga friends na yun because of what happened before. Pero despite that she still keeps hanging out with them. Right now I feel like hindi na niya kino consider na boyfriend niya ako and parang wala siyang side na pinapanigan. Because of that I feel betrayed, angry, and confused kung valid ba tong feelings ko.

Well, this one is a bit unconventional, and I have never done this before. 

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks. Sounds simple, doesn't it ? 

But it isn't. I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. Someone who could help me apartment hunting for a longer trip next time?

All this may sound like a dream, or a really unrealistic situation, but I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

For starters, I am decent looking and well mannered. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is good company and a chill time. I am alone in a new city with no friends. 

I do not know what else to write? Maybe you are curious about my post and have some questions on your mind ? Feel free to reach out and I will try to answer them honestly. If nothing comes out of it, I can atleast try to make the conversation worth your time. ",1,1769447504.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

I started intermittent fasting about three months ago, mostly doing 16:8 (fasting from 8 PM to 12 PM the next day). Honestly, I wasn’t sure I could stick with it at first, but so far it’s been… interesting.

The first few weeks were rough. I got headaches mid-morning and felt super hungry right around 10–11 AM. Coffee helped, and gradually my body got used to the schedule. What surprised me the most was how my energy levels changed. Some days I feel more focused in the morning without breakfast, but other days I feel sluggish. It’s definitely not a “miracle” fix; I still notice that my overall food choices and sleep matter a lot.

One thing I’ve learned is that consistency beats perfection. Missing a fasting window isn’t the end of the world, and I’ve had to remind myself that it’s okay to adjust my eating window if life gets in the way.

I’m curious how others handled the first month’s struggles and what small tweaks helped you stick with IF. Any tips would be awesome!",8,1769447496.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

My LDL in the past couple of years was around 145/150 HDL was around 50.

Blood test at the end of December 2025 showed LDL at 180

The doctor put me on Crestor/Rosuvastatin 10mg once a day.

I suspect thespike from 150ish to 180 could have been due to November / December driving a lot for work assignments out of town, with burgers and unhealthy food, also less activity than usual.

Crestor 10mg gave me some side effects: constipation (I used to be a lot more regular, once a day in the morning), irregular bowel movements, and not feeling emptied after going to the bathroom. Some insomnia, waking at 3 am, and staying up for 1 or 2 hours, with a shorter deep sleep phase (under 1 hour). Some shoulder joint sensitivity, some nausea, and a lower libido.

I switched to taking Crestor in the morning, but I wanted to go for a lower dose.

So I went to the GP doctor. He had my blood drawn, and the results were Total cholesterol 121, LDL went down to 61 (from 180!!), but HDL went down from 53 to 36. Triglycerides were up from 99 to 150 (but I did not fast, I did not know I was going to have my blood drawn, I had large oatmeal and some panettone, 2 coffees with 1 tsp sugar and oatmilk).

At the same time, I increased the amount of fiber, adding a lot of flaxseed to beans, and eating lots of chia seeds/chia pudding.

So that could have helped. I switched to 5mg, which I hope it may be enough and also diminish the side effects.

I may see a cardiologist to see if I have plaque.  
No heart attacks or strokes in my family. My 90-year-old dad at my age was quite overweight, more sedentary, had high blood pressure, and smoked for decades till about age 50. He has stents in his carotids and cognitive decline due to la ack of O2 to the brain.

Ideally, I would like to see if I can keep my LDL at around 100 without statins, with diet, although we have a genetic predisposition.

I rarely use butter, rarely eat eggs, and don't cook much red meat at home. But in late 2025, I ate a lot of cheese.

I also read about statins every other day or once a week as an option, which could be a good compromise.  The doctor seems to agree with that, if I can keep the LDL at around 100-110-120 for 6 months.",2,1769447493.0,Cholesterol,2,1.0,False

I’m trying to be brutally honest with myself, so here’s my situation laid out clearly.

Current situation (Milan):

•	Stable job, 35k gross

•	1.75k net per month + meal vouchers

•	Rent: €910 + utilities

•	I cover everything myself: gym, small “maintenance” expenses, daily costs

•	Life feels… tight. Not bad, just constrained

•	I’m stable, but I don’t feel like I’m progressing financially or professionally.

What I’ve accepted (Paris):

•	New role, €49k gross + 20% performance bonus

•	Estimated net: 2.7–2.9k/month?

•	Rent: €1,100–1,200 (similar impact to Milan)

•	Major benefits: gym at work, daily coffee/food on site, personal care expenses reimbursed

•	Extra perks: €1k annual vacation bonus, meal vouchers coming later

What I’m questioning isn’t whether Paris is “easy.”

It’s whether this move is a real upgrade compared to my current situation.

For people who’ve done a similar switch, did the extra income, benefits, and international exposure actually change your quality of life? Or does it just feel different for a while before becoming the same grind again?

TL;DR:

Milan = stable but tight.

Paris = higher pay, higher costs, more upside.",5,1769447487.0,Expats_In_France,27,0.73,False

By the time my parents split up, I was making new friends in school. My dad was a grain farmer, and moved me and my two brothers, Liam, and Samual, into the country, and onto the farm in the farm house, and we started working for him while also attending school in the day, and coming home to help with repairs on equipment at night, while my dads new wife, Gemma, helped out around the house. When I turned fifteen, I was finally old enough to start working at my dads farm legally, and I put in a recommendation that he hired my best friend Marshall. When he agreed and Marshall started working with me and my brothers, it was like work seemed genuinely fun for once. The same year I rented my first field, 80 acres of land, 8 kilometres away from the nearby town, on a gravel road next to a cattle ranch. In the spring, when we started putting seed in the ground, I noticed something, the cows would always hide near the nearby barn on the other side of the road, in my neighbours yard. I paid no mind to it, at first. Cows will be cows, and do dumb things. When I had finished for the night, and as morning was creeping over the horizon, I saw Marshall drive over to my field in my truck. He was working the day shift, and came to swap me out and take the tractor and planter to the next field. “No rest for the wicked, eh?” He laughed as I climbed out of the tractor cab, with an empty thermos, and an empty lunch box. “All yours.” \*I said to him as I walked towards my truck parked on the roadside, next to the seed trailer attached to the semi. The drive back home wasn’t anything to write home about. The neighbours cows in the corner of his yard, the few parked tractors and other machinery parked out in the vast expanse of the Canadian prairies, and the occasional truck heading to one of the fields where green tractors of all sizes wait. When I got to the yard, I parked my truck next to Marshall’s car,  and left my keys in the centre console, before heading inside. I made my way to my bedroom, and shrugged off all my clothes and plopped down in bed. I heard a whine, and looked around my room. My brothers were probably still asleep in their rooms, Gemma in her room, and the dog was probably asleep on the couch, or at least that’s what I thought until I looked under my bed to see our dog Rori was hiding under my bed. “Rori? What are you doing here?” I asked her, confused, as I tried to get her out from under my bed, but she wouldn’t come out. So I called my losses, and just went to sleep. Later that afternoon, at supper time, I came out to join Gemma at dinner, and grab my food before running out field meals before switching Marshall off in the field. “How’d you sleep, Nathan?” She asked, and handed me my bagged dinner, as well as grandpa’s bagged dinner. “Not bad. The dog slept under my bed. She’s still in there right now, actually.” I said while putting my jacket on. “She’s never done that before.” I said to her. She nodded, handed me my thermos filled with coffee, and my energy drink from the fridge. “Tell Marshall I said hi.” She said and started cleaning up from dinner. The drive out to field 43 was boring, no animals crossing the road, no cars, nothing. The field corner was illuminated by the lights of the tractor, and the air seeder. I parked my truck at the end of the row, and hopped out, lighting a cigarette while sitting in the bed of my truck. After five ish minutes of smoking, and waiting for Marshall make the pass up the row, and stop to swap me out. “What’s up, chuckle nuts?” I laughed as Marshall got out of the tractor. “Ah go fucker yourself.” He retorted, heading straight for my truck. Crushing out the little bit of a cigarette I had left, I hopped down from the box of the truck, and grabbed my lunch and energy drink. “You need all that?” He asked and pointed at my thermos, and energy drink. “I’m here for a long time, not a good time.” I chuckle, and climbed up the ladder leading to the cab to the tractor, while he got in my truck, and flipped me off, and I return the gesture, our way of saying goodbye. “Oh yeah, your mom texted me, asking about when you’ll be home.” I said and he rolled his eyes and started driving down the road. His mom was much like mine, except his dad split custody with her, and he would go to his moms every weekend at the end of the month. Driving up and down the rows was boring, as I drank a sip of my coffee every five rows, rationing the caffeine. It would go like that throughout the seasons. I’d work through the night, and sleep through the day, with my work keeping me busy, until a family reunion in September. My parents, brothers, uncles and aunts, nephews, and cousins all gathered in the farmhouse’s backyard, where dad manned the grill with his dad, and brother. I was hanging out with my cousins, 4 beers deep and watching them play wrestling on the trampoline. My little cousin, James, was watching the tree line at the back of the yard. “James, what are you looking at, buddy?” I asked, and set my beer down by the picnic table and walked over to him. “Hey, what’s going on, buddy? Why aren’t you playing on the trampoline?” I said, kneeling down to his level. He didn’t say anything, and clutched his little teddy bear in his arms. The field around the house and farmyard was hidden by the trees in the backyard. He didn’t say anything, just sort of hid in front of me, since my back was to the tree line. As the wind whipped at the tree tops, he back grabbed my arm, still staring at the tree line. At the same moment Marshall showed up, with a pack of moosehead, and a bottle of fireball. I glanced at Marshall, and led James towards the other kids on the trampoline. Me, Marshall, and my cousins my age started drinking and laughing as we started doing our own thing. I can't remember what we were talking about, something about a bull pucky rule about the school district in the city where my cousins went to, when we heard a woman screaming from the Workshop across the yard. I can't forget it. My aunty, screaming “My boy! My baby! Help! Someone help!” As if on que, all the adults and teens dropped everything, running to the workshop where we saw my little cousin with his armed pinned under a heavy duty tool box, which toppled over, and crushed his arm, letting out a scream I can only compare to a drill bit that rang out and bounced off the walls of the shop. Me and my grandpa grabbed the top of the  tool box, while Liam and Sam grabbed the sides, and lifted. His arm was a mess, limp, with his bone having been shattered into multiple pieces when the tool box tipped over. My uncle George, grabbed him, and carried him to my car, his wife following, crying profusely. Going back to the backyard, we all sat quietly, and drank. Nobody said anything, while the kids ran around, unaware of the tension brewing inside of us. My older cousin, Eric, sipped his beer, and got up, and called out to his kids. “Amy, James. I think were gonna go.” he said, while his wife went to start his car. Amy came running, barely 3 years old, and babbling. “James, stop playing in the trees!” his wife, Connie, shouted. But when James didn't come out from the treeline where we thought he was, she went in there, only to come out and say in a hushed tone. “Hes not there!” The family started searching the yard, fearing he might have wandered over to the bins, or got locked in one of the 3 equipment sheds across the yard. When we couldnt find him there, we started searching the nearby area. I’m not proud to admit it, but despite being tore up from the floor up, I got in my ranger and started driving around a 3 kilometre area around the farm, searching. I drove through ditches, along treelines, drove across field after field, fearing he had gone onto one, and was walking further away. Wasnt till 10 minutes later, I saw my dad driving out in his truck to come talk to me. “Marshall found james. Over by your feild.” now, to understand why this is so shocking, is that the area we live in is located, 15 kilometres away from the highway, and between the provincal capital city, and a small town along the way. The gap between the city and town being close to 150 kilometres. The distance between the small town, which is 8 kilometres awat from my feild, is also 24 kilometres away from our family farm. So this 5 year old, walked from our family farm, to my feild, in less than 15 minutes, all while there was 24 adults in vehicles searching for him. When I got back to the farm, everyone was going, why stay at a family reunion when you saw a 9 year olds arm get turned into jelly, and where a 5 year old walked 16 kilometres, in 15 minutes. After everyone left, my parents stayed in ther room, and I stayed in the workshop with Liam, still drinking, trying to come up with conclusions on how the tool box fell, while sam picked up the tools that spilt out when it toppled over. The tool box was 183 centimetres tall, or for any american readers, six feet. We did come up with some conclusions, that Ricky got too close, and slammed against it, causing it to lurch and crash down, but how could a child weighing less than a quarter of this thing move it? I dont know, even now. I think there was some interference, or something. But the only person nearby was his mom. I dont know, I still dont. I tell you this though, Marshall started acting off. When hangng out by the dumbsters and smoking during our lunchbreak, he would stare at me while smoking, and refuse to have one if offered. At first I just chalked it up to him quitting smoking, like he said he would, but when he thought nobody was looking, he take cigarette butts, and put them in his mouth. I walked out one day, and saw him doing it. “I knew you were into some fucked up shit, but bug chasing is new. You trying to speed run getting typhus or some shit?” I laughed nervously, light a cigarette. He pushed past me, not bothering to spit out the cigarette butts, as he went inside dramatically. “Must be that time of the month again.” I muttered and kept smoking. At work, he’d stare at the farmhouse when we were filling up with gas at the pumps, or moving equipment out of the sheds, or working in the repair shop, so on, so on. He would often times doze off, or go on some magical adventure in his head while we worked together. Dinner conversations switched from being about school and all, to how weird he was acting. One day, in august, me and him, and my grandpa were in the workshop, putting a new drum for the header onto the combine, the drum being the thing that sort of ushers wheat towards the knives of the header. “Here, hold it still while I hammer it out.” I said to Marshall, as he held the drum. “Nate? Where’d you put the impact?” my grandpa asked, right as I swung my hammer. Natural instinct kicked in, and I turned to face him, just as the hammer slammed home onto the centre of my middle finger, breaking it. I wish I could tell you what I exactly said, but it was more cursing than actual words. Grandpa ran over, grabbed my hand and started leading me to his brand new truck he bought, while Marshall just watched. No emotion, no concern, nothing. The ride to the hospital was painful, and I held my now purple and black middle finger in my other hand, hoping it would ease the pain. All I could think about was Marshall, how he looked at my finger with almost a bored expression now that I think about it. Like my pain was an inconvience. Maybe it was shock, maybe it was fear, or something else, I dunno. A few months later, and it was harvest time, and I had recently started dating this girl, Savanah. When I wasnt working, or barely passing class, I was with her. She got me on this nicotine gum, and helped me quit smoking, but gave up on getting me to quit drinking when she found out I was drunk most the times we were on call with each other. Marshalls girlfriend, Emma, would often ask me if Marshall was okay, and I’d always lie, and tell her marshall was just distracted from quiting smoking. But she’d tell me he was violent, more prone to random fits of joy, then anger the second she was happy. “Old boys got bipolar.” I would laugh, and joke everytime she mentioned it, but I couldnt shake the unease wash over me as well. I had noticed the mood swings, but also a empty looking stare, like when youre watching a murder documentary, and the killers mugshot just seems wrong. During harvest, things only would get weirder. When I was running the combine at night, along with grandpa in the other combine, I noticed when Marshall swapped me off, and got in my truck to head back to the farm, he’d often just sit up the road in my truck, like he was watching us. Everynight, sam would radio from the grain cart, “he’s still there?” and I’d always come up with some snarky response. But after the 4th night, I stopped commenting, and so did Sam. when harvesting my feild, the neighbours cows would go to the otherside of their yard whenever he was near. One night, I came out to sawp Marshall off, when I noticed my neighbour, whos in his mid 80s, in a tractor, using its forks to pull something out of the watering hole in the ranch yard. A cow. A dead cow, that willingly went in there, to drown itself. I kept driving. On Saturday, I drove out to my field in the daytime, looking at my field before my grandpa mentioned people were in my field. Parking my truck along the road, I got out, and walked into it, looking for any tracks or signs of trespassers. Finding none, I walked back to my truck, and hopped in the driver side. I was tired from getting up from sleeping during the day time, so I leant back, and started to sleep. When I woke up, it was night time, and my trucks interior light was on, despite my door being closed, and my truck being shut off.  turning on my truck, I started driving down the road, stopping when what looked like a man ran in front of my trucks high beams into my neighbours yard. I stopped, because he came out of my field, and I couldn’t see his face. I got out of my truck, grabbing my knife from my centre console. “Hey, asshole! Get out here! Why the hell were you in my field!?” I shouted and chased after the man. He hopped the razor wire fence that kept my neighbours cattle on the ranch, and ran towards the wooded area of the ranch. I chased after him, losing sight multiple times as he bobbed between the trees and ran towards the watering hole. Without waiting for me, he jumped into the watering hole, and started swimming towards the shore. I ran over to the shore, and grabbed him, pulling him into the moonlight. He was naked, had black skin so dark that the only way I could see him besides the moonlight was his face, or lack of one, missing a mouth, nose, ears, but he had bright white eyes. He started grabbing at me, clawing, punching, and soon I was the one running as he chased me, letting out these inhuman screams and wails. When I got to my truck, he was right behind me. I slammed the door shut and tried closing the window, but he got to it before I could roll it up. He round up and swung, hitting me square in the jaw. Everything went black for a few seconds, then returned to normal. I was still in my truck, except now I was alone. My window still rolled down, and when I looked at the clock, I noticed time had seem to had gone backwards. Freaked out, I drove off, heading back to the farm. By the end of harvest, we held the annual harvest dinner. A big dinner, where all our family, even my cousins from the U.S. would come, sit down, talk, drink, eat, and do whatever. Marshall was not invited. The small single story house would be too small, so like usual, we moved the combines and tractors and trailers and other equipment out of the shed, cleaned it up, before moving in a bunch of folding tables, and chairs. The next day, the family came over, and socialized in the shed 75 meter long shed. Everyone was having fun, and drinking, and I even let my nephews have a sip of beer while nobody was looking. Savannah was with me, and talking with my cousins, robert, and Julie, from the states, when I noticed eric and connie, and james and amy coming in through the side door. “Hey, guys! Come on over, have something to drink, why not?” I said, and handed eric a beer. “So, hows the kids doing?” Savannah asked, and Eric started talking about trouble at school, and more problems. He didn’t look as good as he used to. His clean shaven face turned into stubble, and his hair slicked back, but long. Connie looked no better, her eyes sunk, and devoid of any joy, her shoulders slumped, like she’d been carrying bags of concrete on her back for years on end. They seemed drained, tired, even their kids weren’t spared from the exhausted look. Looking droopy and pale, with their faces almost looking identical with their saggy eyes, chapped lips, and messy hair. “So, the citys 

been treating ya roughly?” \*I asked, and looked them over. “No, we’re just bogged down with work… school… uhh grocery shopping, and… so on.” He said drearily. The rest of the night came and went without any issue. The cousins played around the shed, while the adults drank and talked about stuff, while me and the other teenagers went and got plastered outside. At about midnight, I was tore up from the floor up, and outside having a smoke with my nephew, Duncan, while Savannah, his girlfriend were inside. That’s when someone started walking towards the shed, covered by the moonlight. “You missed half the party!” I laughed, and stepped forward thinking it was my uncle or someone who showed up late. To my surprise, it was Marshall. He stopped and stared at me and Duncan. “Marshall? The fuck are you doing here? My family told you you weren’t invited.” I said, tossing my cigarette aside and stepping closer to him. He didn’t say anything. At the same time, there was a commotion inside the shed, and when I looked in, I saw James had bitten and latched onto Ricky’s leg. “James! Get off him!” My dad shouted, running over to pry him off Ricky. Ricky was crying and wailing, kicking uselessly. When James was pulled off, he had a chunk of Ricky’s skin in his mouth, and was furiously trying to scratch my dad. His parents and sister were nowhere to be seen, while other parents grabbed their kids and started leaving. When I looked back at where Marshall was standing, I saw he was gone. The rest happened so quick, but Ricky’s mom and dad carried him to the car and sped out of the farmyard as fast as they could. But James and his family were gone, and everyone headed home. Nothing really happened since then, and now. Connie, Erik, Amy, and Ricky went radio silent, and weren’t seen by anyone in the family. Marshall stopped showing up to school and work, but I chalked it up to him not having any work to be done on the farm during winter. Now it’s January, and I know that these aren’t just random accidents or shit. Last night, I was sleeping in the living room after passing out watching TV, when something shoved me. When I woke up, I saw there were those white eyed things just watching me, and whispering my “join us” over and over again. I tried drowning out the noise, but they didn’t stop, so in a fit of desperation, I threw the remote at them, only for them to disappear and the remote embed itself in the drywall. “Stop fucking with me!” When I walked past the patio door, I saw that the house was surrounded by them, and Marshall, and Emma, and Erik, Connie, Amy, James, all holding hands with those things. Those monsters. I wish I could tell you I went out with a rifle to scare them off. I didn’t. I ran down the stairs to my room in the basement so fast, whenever a shadow in the corner was slightly darker than the rest of the basement, I’d nearly trip over my feet. My room has no windows, so I hid in there, my only protection was my pocket knife. Despite there being no windows, the things outside didn’t stop their haunting. They banged on the side of the house, rattled the locked upstairs door knobs, and tapped on all windows of the house throughout the night. I spent the night crying and shouting at them to “leave me alone! Get the fuck out of here! Leave me alone, you little fuckers!” But they never stopped, as if my desperation was fueling them to keep harassing me. When I eventually fell asleep, it was like I was drowning. I was drowning in an ocean of black water, while those things stood on shore, laughing at me sinisterly. When I awoke, it was already mid afternoon. My parents who went to capable city for a date night, and Liam who was at university, and Sam attending a sleepover with his friends, meant I had the house to myself. Outside I couldn’t believe my eyes, no feet prints at all. Was I dreaming? No, I remember exactly how they tapped on the windows and banged on the house walls. The TV remote was still lodged in the kitchen wall, meaning what I did last night was real. And it hits me now. These things, these monsters, they aren’t gonna stop. Not unless I do something. Today, I drove out to my field and looked around. The cows were still acting weird in my neighbours yard, and field and the surrounding ones were covered in thick blankets of snow. There was no pitch black skin and white eyed men, no shadow people, nothing. I feel stupid even now. I had brought out my dads shotgun, and just wanted it to end. Then I realized it. Are they attached to someone? If so, who? And then I realized it was probably Marshall, and my aunt and uncles family. They were acting so weird, so different. Today passed without incident, except whenever I was driving, I could swear I’d hear someone whisper something from my back seat. Now it’s 11:43. I’m sitting outside James, Amy, and Erik and Connie’s house, and writing this on my phone. I got 8 shells in this shotgun, and 6 more in my pocket, and 5 in my other pocket for Marshall and Emma. This thing needs to be stopped. I’ll try to do an update, but you shouldn’t get your hopes up. I’m either insane, or I’m about to stop some unholy evil. I’ll either die trying, or end up in prison for the rest of my life. Who knows, but I swear these monsters are just gonna keep spreading if I don’t do this.  Anyways, I gotta go. I’ll try to keep you in the loop if I’m not dead or in jail, but I can’t make any promises.

Cursed Clan: Pilot

The sounds of winds rumble across the place, the ground cracks, rocks everywhere, bodies scattered against the floor, blood shedding, the sounds of war echoing across the surroundings. A man, kneeling down in the middle of a pool of blood, clutching a lifeless body, the sky and atmosphere turns bloodred as it is revealed that he is silently crying, hands shaking. Tears falling down on the lifeless body, he looks visibly distraught, wide-eyed. The world dissolves, the environment around him slowly becomes encapsulated by shadows until it is completely dark. The body fades into the fog and he is left shaken, still wide-eyed he gets up and turns around yelling “Hello?!”. “Daiki…” a rasping whisper coming from the shadows, Daiki knows what’s coming, but still scared. A being steps forward emerging out of the shadows slowly, its form unfinished and unstable. The rasping whisper continues as he puts one hand up while slowly shuffling towards Daiki “I can return what was unrightfully taken from you…” a pause and then continues “of this unjustful world…”, another pause as he continues to slowly shuffle “find me the Kongō Kakushi… And break it! Open the veil for me”, the entity became crazy and almost desperate. Then a loud silence. A beautiful mono-tone female voice is heard “I am not where you buried me.”. The entity’s smile widens and a slight evil laugh can be heard.

Daiki jolts awake, drenched in sweat and gulps and then holds tight onto his cross on his neck. His home is quiet, peaceful and the sound of birds can be heard chirping outside, in fact maybe a bit too peaceful, but Daiki feels a sense of relief and loses grip of the cross. Daiki’s young child, Homu, is struggling with his shoes by the door, tongue out, concentrating. Homu shouts in the distance; “Daddy!” Daiki lets out a wry smile and gets up from his bed revealing a slim, but muscular physique in white underwear, stretches his arms out slightly while walking towards Homu and gently ties his shoes “There you go buddy” and smiles warmly with his eyes closed. “Come on Homu, you’re always so slow!...” says his older brother Nerisho and Daiki, sending them both off to school with a wave and a laugh. The door closes. The smile collapses as exhaustion, grief, terror and obsession linger on Daiki’s face. He lets go, body collapsing to the wall, exhaling like a man drowning slowly as his body slowly glides to the floor.

A nice office setting. Daiki is heard talking with his therapist about his dreams and hallucinations. His leg shakes with anxiety and the therapist calmly puts her hand on his leg and explains “Sometimes when we lose a loved one our minds try to fill out the empty space. That’s why it feels so real, but you’re here, you’re safe, you’re in this room. Nothing can hurt you right now.” a slight pause ""Daiki is safe.” Daiki’s leg stops shaking. He leaves the therapist office, thanks the therapist and walks into the toilet when he looks himself in the mirror he hears “I am not where you buried me” once again by the same voice that he once loved. He washes his face, collapses on the floor believing he is going crazy and affirms to himself that it isn’t real, but his disorientation gets the best of him. We then see him in the middle of a graveyard with a shovel in his hand debating whether or not he should do it or not. He then starts digging, with each dig he lets out a grunt of pain, tears slowly, but hesitantly falling down his eyes. In the end when he reaches the casket and opens it, his eyes turn wide open. There is nothing. A man can be heard in the distance shouting at him, startled. He turns his head, leaves his shovel and runs as fast as he can, his breath shortening and heart pulsating. We then view Daiki going into the beautiful Get village in the middle of the futuristic city, very out of place. While walking there we see a news clip on the TV passing by that the cultural leader of the Gets, Get Anji had passed away due to old age. Daiki enters the village gates, a beautiful village with ponds and monasteries, sakura trees and blossoming flowers, children running around. He walks into their library of history and as he passes by the people he looks visibly distraught, looking around trying to find something and then grabs a random book. From day to night, he continually researches. Daiki finds himself between old myths and clan theories and demon folklore trying to find a way back.

***intro begins***

“Once upon a time God created mankind in heaven, but when mankind disobeyed God and were tempted by the serpent, God cast them out of heaven onto earth. Already on earth were beasts of every size, but also the Asura. The Asura mixed with mankind. Eiji Okina, born of  forbidden union. Over time, an endless and fragile war erupted between the two beings. Inheriting secrets and abilities never meant for human hands, he made a decision that would echo across generations. He created a veil between the two worlds, woven of ancient magic, separating the Asura world from the human world, not a wall, but a fragile, trembling promise of peace. Eiji encapsulated the veil into a diamond that he would pass on to his descendants entrusted with it. From these bloodlines rose many great clans…

Ninjai

The Sōzō-teki

The Kakusei

The Tōiki

The Kongō Kakushi

The Onkeidō.

And the Get Clan

At the center of their fate, laid the diamond, a relic of immeasurable power. For centuries these clans have fought over the diamond for its immense power. During the Sōzō-teki and Kongō Kakushi wars, a rebel from within the Sōzō-teki, Get Panda created his own movement and joined the enemy side of Kongō Kakushi. The leader of the Kongō Kakushi passed away due to old age and a general named Reishi took over leadership and inherited the Kongō Kakushi Diamond, but was exiled by Get Panda due to Kongō Kakushi’s fleeting strength and eventually the Kongō Kakushi was subsided, defeated and assimilated into the Get movement. The Diamond was reportedly lost after this event and never found again.

***Intro ends***

Back in the present Chiko casually finishes her lesson, coffee in her hand, smiling as if she didn’t just describe centuries of bloodshed. “Any questions”, as we see no one with their hands up except for a nerdy kid with glasses raising his hand. Josuke stares out the window, bored, his right cheek laying on his hand. “You excited for your coronation today?” Shio hesitantly says with a slight stutter. Nonchalantly “It’s just tradition”, Josuke shrugs. Classmates, whisper and stare. We see Zetto in between everyone's quiet admiration of Josuke, his jaw tightens, angry and disappointed in what the Get Clan had become. His mind echoes “Should’ve been me…” as he looks into the ground, fists clenched and visibly angry. Ayaka notices and approaches him gently, but hesitantly 

“Hey, is this about?...”, 

Zetto says “there’s nothing, It doesn’t matter”,  
Ayake says “Hey, you can’t fool me? I know you better than anyone and I can see that something’s rumbling your mind right now.”

Zetto snaps “it’s fine!..”

Ayake “It’s not fine”

a slow pause and tension in the atmosphere

Zetto looks around contemplating before hesitantly admitting “Fine!…I'm jealous, okay?\* ""Happy?""

Ayake quietly, but playfully laughs “I knew it”, “Maybe your grandfather never wanted you to follow in his footsteps, maybe there was a good reason for it, always put the Clan first Zetto”

Zetto pauses “the clan, the clan, the clan… The Gets name used to inspire fear, now it inspires tourist groups.”

Ayake, clearly impressed by the determination, she smirks “If you really want to get the Gets back on top, I got an idea…”

In a deserted area and a cliff going down hundreds of meters with a fall that no one can survive.. It’s very mysterious, we see the dust and hear the wind. Someone can be heard explaining something, his shoes and a couple of other shoes can be seen. They all have school uniforms on. We hear a struggle going on, someone yelling stop and then the voice disappears. We see a bag coming out of the person's head and the students laughing mischievously. Shio and Josuke sit down on the rock outside in the school yard. Zetto runs towards them, exhausted, out of breath. ""Josuke!"" “Your cousin!... Kuran! The school kids…” still out of breath and pausing between each sentence “They took her.. they’re planning to kill her! the students!”. Josuke hesitates and is visibly disturbed, a fierce look comes upon his face and he sprints towards the cliffs. There he sees them holding Kuran and smiling, some of them laughing. Josuke clenches his fists and teeth. The students continue to laugh at him “what’re you going to do pussy?”, “leave her alone!”. Josuke clearly wants to do something, but there’s a cliff behind them, so he cannot be reckless. Zetto then says “there’s no one within a one mile radius Josuke, we had them seek out the area. Either little Kuran over there is going to meet her demise today or you’re going to save her by jumping off this cliff right here, right now. Or are you too much of a coward like you have always been?” the students laugh repeating what Zetto says like hyenas “you’ve always been a coward” they say. Josuke says “Fine…” “you promise you aren’t going to hurt Kuran?”. “I promise.”. Josuke says “Alright then” Josuke gulps and takes slow steps towards the edge of the cliff. As he’s preparing to jump off Kuran looks over to him, surprised that he’s actually doing it, “no…” she mumbles. Josuke steps off and falls down the cliff. Zetto is visibly disturbed, he was shocked that he would actually do it, and a hint of regret is shown on his face. Kuran starts screaming and then gets told to shut up by the students, but she does not stop. They slap her and then she stops. Even Ayaka who planned all of this is also shocked, they both regret what they have done, but then Josuke is seen floating in the air and they’re all shocked. Josuke levitates onto the ground once again, the dust floating everywhere from his feet when he lands, even he himself is surprised. A small struggle can be heard from behind the shocked students and they all turn around. It is Fura, their teacher. He used telekinesis. He put his arms down after using his powers, his face filled with anger. Whoever planned this will face a grave judgement upon them.

A dark room, staircases show, torches slowly being lit by a man. That man is Daiki. As he descends the stairs he enters into a mysterious, but ancient looking chamber. He walks deeper into the darkness, water slowly dripping from the roof making a small splashing sound each time. Daiki sees it, an ancient, rectangular, dusty acacia chest. The outside of the chest was covered with wood and pure gold. Ancient angelic symbolism on the chair. He hesitantly opened it. Small light came out of it, but no diamond. It was just gold inside of it. “Where is it?!”his hands scramble around in the gold trying to find the diamond, but to no avail. Defeated, he slowly drowns into the floor, hands on his face, exhausted, about to give up. He starts believing his hallucinations and dreams were just that. Hallucinations and dreams. He then hears a noise from inside the chest, he goes to look and finds a hidden door. He opens it and there it is, the diamond. He grabs it, but with hesitation. He’s about to put the diamond down, scared that he’s going to do something bad, but then out of the diamond a raspy, slow and silent whisper is heard “Daiki…” followed by a long breath. Daiki gets startled and drops the diamond. Silence. Very loud silence.

We see parents talking with Fura and then Zetto alone in his room, grounded, not allowed to view the coronation. Ayaka sneakily enters Zetto’s room with food, Zetto angry doesn’t even look her way “I got this for you” she says and then slowly slides the door closed. “Pfft”. The monastery is filled with lights, candles, banners and tradition. The portraits of past leaders and prominent clan members line the big halls. Zedio, aged but proud, stands tall. Josuke kneels, the crown is raised. In the dark, silent room, Daiki heads back up the stairs convinced that it was just a myth, a folk tale, but hears something. It sounds like a snake's tail, rattling. He quickly turns back and many spirits enter out of the broken pieces, some out of the walls. An elder Asura confronts him “What have you done?! You fool!” As the room gets overcrowded by demonic spirits, some laughing, some furious, some terrified, Daiki is torn apart in the chaos. The veil screams, a loud demonic scream can be heard all over the world, people all over the world wondering what is going on. The coronation hall collapses, the Gets and the people from the other clans who have come to witness the coronation all are disturbed. “The veil has been broken!” it is said by an elder from another village. Zedio and the elders stand their ground using their powers, buying time. Fire consumes the monastery. Demons rampage through the city. Sirens wail. Buildings fall. The modern weak world meets ancient horror. Chiko and Fūra shepherd the children and all of the survivors they can through the smoke and ruin. One demon is watching Jōsuke run…smiling. Jōsuke looks back. Everything he was born to protect is burning. Cut to black. Zetto wakes up to see smoke and fire everywhere. He tries to escape it, but sees demons in every corner he tries to turn to in the monastery. Eventually he gets out of the monastery and sees his whole world burning down, left behind for dead with it.",1,1769447211.0,u_Commercial-Cicada562,0,1.0,False

After years of this, it's gotten to the point, where I don't feel a need to seek male companionship anymore.

However, I still get excited from gay porn and hot scenes from stuff like Heated Rivalry. There's no bicurious interest, since women have never interested me.

I’m currently a 36 years old male. I almost never liked soda for most of my life. I remember one summer when I was 13 years old, I visited my cousins and we would always get soda from the store. After I returned home, I realized that I actually didn’t like soda and never ordered it again unless it was the only option available.

I started drinking black coffee around age 16. Like many others, I spent my late high school years, all of college, and then my working career relying on coffee. When I didn’t drink coffee, I would feel very tired and start getting sleepy in the afternoon. If I took a nap, I’d wake up with a headache. If I still didn’t drink coffee on the second day, I’d get a strong headache and the nerve in the back of my neck would start twitching. So coffee became part of my daily routine from age 16 onward.

In July 2024, I had diverticulitis (basically a really bad stomach infection). I went on a bowel rest diet and stopped drinking coffee. I felt terrible for the first 10 days, but it helped that I was on pain medication anyway. After that, I started to feel “awake” again. My head felt lighter, I could think clearly, and I no longer felt tired without coffee.

A few weeks later, there was a day when I barely slept the night before and felt exhausted at work. I had a can of Diet Coke at a company event, and the caffeine helped me get through the day. I tried it again and again, and eventually got hooked on Diet Coke and Coke Zero. I realized this was probably more unhealthy than coffee, so I went back to drinking only two cups (volume wise, about 500 ml) of coffee in the morning on workdays. My soda cravings went away during this time.  However, on weekends when I didn’t drink coffee, I’d feel tired and eventually the headaches would come back. So after about three months of drinking coffee again, I quit once more. Then the soda cravings returned. At work, watching TV at home, at restaurants, or at sporting events, whether I felt tired or not, I always wanted my soda.

Over the past year, I’ve tried tea and decaf coffee, but the soda cravings didn’t go away. I don’t get headaches when I stop drinking soda like I do when quitting coffee, but it's unhealthy and the cravings can get pretty annoying. I don’t plan on ever going back to regular coffee, and I’m working on avoiding soda for health reasons.

I started this post only because I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.   Thanks in advance!

Hello Langga,

It's been a while no? Can't believe na 6 years na pala since we last saw each other.

It's been a while din when you left the south and moved to Manda. I heard through one of our friends na ininvite mo daw sila sa new place nyo ng fam mo. I felt sad when I heard that, but it's okay.

Kamusta ka na? I also heard that you got into sewing/crochet. That's nice! You've always been the queen of DIY (which actually inspired me). Naalala ko when we had that project some years back, you sketched the artwork for that. Ang galing mo din kasi mag drawing.

Remember Starbucks Dona Soledad? Those days will always live on sa memory ko; UNO nights with our friends and yes, coffee until we palpitate! (We were a lot younger back then.) It's also the place where we had our first date after meeting on Tinder (4/20 yon, tanda ko pa.)

Those out of town trips with our friends, our banters, those nights we used to watch american series/animations on Netflix (wubbalubbadubdub?), sabay nag-yoyosi ng Marlboro blue, sometimes sinusundo kita sa school mo sa U-Belt after ko magturo sa Mendiola. Yung mga food trip and yung mga nadiscover nating Japanese resto sa South... oh, so much fun we had, no?

Then one December, we spent a quality time together in Starbucks Macapagal. It was the night before you leave for Japan. Ang saya pa natin nagkekwentuhan. Actually, doon pa lang Sepanx na ako eh. Pero you had to go for vacation....

A few days later, we parted ways. And yes, ang tanga ko din kasi. 

*I never wanted to make you go*

*You may be a stranger now*

*But I just wanted to let you know*

*I meant what I said*

*Losing you is like cutting my fingers off*

Ngayon, our friends are no longer here. Yung mga spot sa south na we used to hang out, wala na din. Pero yung memories, they still haunt me every now and then. Siguro kasi langga, ikaw lang yung minahal ko ng ganun. And I think wala ng papantay doon.

Naalala ko noon, we used to dream of living in Japan kasi we both love the culture and the food! Remember, sinamahan mo ako mag process ng documents ko noon sa QC when I first tried my luck? Kaso, bumagsak ako sa demo. Hahah fun times talaga...

This year langga, pupunta na ako sa Japan. I'll move and live there for a very long time. 6 years of not seeing you made me accept the fact na siguro, hindi na tayo magkikita ulit. Hindi na siguro inallow ng tadhana.

Naalala lang kita langga. Alam ko na masaya ka na ngayon and di ko na i-wiwish na bumalik ka. Siguro hanggang dun nalang yung story natin. Dadalhin ko nalang ang mga ala-ala natin sa puso ko. 

Marami pa akong gustong sabihin, ga. pero siguro hanggang dito nalang muna.

Mahal kita langga, totoong minahal kita. 

*I miss you, beautiful and I miss your kiss*

*Something tells me I may never see you here again.*

1qnln3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1qnln3q/what_do_you_think_of_this_10k_theater_plan/,What do you think of this $10k Theater plan,"Hey y'all lurker for a long while, first time poster! Last year my wife and I moved into a new house that has a dedicated theater room! Yay us! But with buying the house (and all the unexpected things that comes along with that) I've just now saved and set a budget to start getting some gear up there. 



\## The space we're working with

The room is a 20' by 12'10"" rectangle. It has very plush carpet (honestly a little too plush imo, but I'm thinking that should be good for the sound). And it's got conduit run throughout with blank faceplates for back L and R speakers as well as for front L and R speakers, as well as behind where the screen will be. There is also a faceplate with conduit 14' from the screen side for a place to mount a projector. That's the good news!

On the other side of the ledger, It has a single window with a old school pull down roller blackout blind as well as a curtain rod. Also the upper portion of the walls on three sides pitch up fairly steeply up to the tall flat portion in the center (the flat portion of the ceiling is 10' tall). I'm not certain if that's working for me or against me as far as sound goes but I'm definitely sure its going to make mounting equipment a bit interesting. 

And one of the biggest issues with the room for now is the ceiling fan. I'm really conflicted about the ceiling fan. If I go projector then the fan that is there is 100% not an option. Its right in front of the ceiling conduit and faceplate for the projector and its on an extension rod. So if I go projector and maybe even otherwise that ceiling fan has got to go our be changed. However, this is an upstairs room in Texas. It gets warm in the summer (March-November) and the ceiling fan would be quite appreciated. One of the things I want to know here is if anyone has a low-profile ceiling fan in front of their projector and how that worked out. Theoretically if the fan is not casting a shadow it should be fine right? 



\## The Budget



Ok I front-ran with the budget but I want to break down what I need to get out of this.

$10k is going to try to cover the following:

\- seating, I want a sectional I think its going to eat like 2k out of the budget. I do not care for traditional theater seats, armchairs, etc. 

\- Projector + Screen \\ TV - I'm still on the fence here but my heart wants a 120in projector screen

\- AV receiver

\- Surround Sound speakers - I'm thinking 5.1, im thinking the CG23M 5.1 bundle from rsl speakers

\- Mounting hardware/speaker wire/consumables

\- Probably some treatment for sound?

\- Whatever I'm not thinking of that you lovely experts will suggest!



\## Projector or TV



As I said the heart wants what the heart wants so Im leaning projector. But I'm curious if yall will reinforce that or convince me otherwise. The room does have a window. So its not ideal from the start. With just the blind in there though it does get DARK so I'm thinking that putting a blackout curtain over that will give me pretty solid light control. It would also be cool to have the option to open the blinds and sometimes enjoy daytime/sports in less than total darkness. 

I've also heard that big screen wins out. With a projector looks like id be looking at 120""! Excite! Excite! \*jazz hands\* With a TV Im thinking wed be max 85-90""? Which would still be quite a bit larger than my living room 65"" so I wouldnt be complaining



\## The Sesmic Shakes of it all

Like I said this room is upstairs... you can pretty well hear someone walking around up there; god only knows what happens when a 10"" 300 watt sub enters the chat. I want Interstellar to be orgasmic but I dont need to shake the entire house. A) gods honest truth, am I looking at too much speaker. B) what can I do to reduce the shakes? Im thinking if its audible downstairs but stops short of recreating the T-Rex scene in Jurrassic Park in my wife's coffee we will have found a happy medium. Any recommendations? I've seen feet for subs that will absorb some vibration. And I'm hoping that the super plush carpet will help dampen that as well



\## Planned Products

Right now I'm thinking: 

\[Epson Home Cinema LS11000\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TS2M1ZS/?coliid=IT5RTM9LUXZM6&colid=36HLSR8A0PE9F&psc=0) $4999

\[Denon AVR-X1800H\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TS2M1ZS/?coliid=IT5RTM9LUXZM6&colid=36HLSR8A0PE9F&psc=0) $799

\[STR Series 6 White 120""\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CYLOTPK/?coliid=IY395RJSU8LKR&colid=36HLSR8A0PE9F&th=1) $279

\[RSL CG23M 5.1 Bundle\](https://rslspeakers.com/products/10e-cg23m-5-1-home-theater-system) - $996

Apple TV 4k - $149

Blackout Curtains - \~$100

A sectional - $2k

Which gets the big ticket items out of the way with $678 to be used on mounting/hardware/wire as well as any simple sound treatments. Not sure what I would do as far as going a TV route but I would think it would be roughly in the same ballpark as the projector-screen combo

Would you spend differently? What do you think I'm over spending/under spending on?

1qnlmck,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1qnlmck/a_game_about_building_a_house_of_cards_need_help/,A game about building a House of Cards --Need help,"So I have had this idea for a while for a cozy, sandbox game about building a house of cards.   
The basic idea is:  
Build a house of cards.   
Rotates/adjust the angle of cards by mouse rotation.  
Click and drag to place.  
Different cards unlock: Base cards (harder to topple) Sticky cards (sticks to other cards), etc.    
Unlock different decks Ambient sounds: Night, Rain (sun/night)

The lore of the game would be:  
A tired worker starts under-performing after his mom just dies of cancer, his boss tells him to take a few weeks off. The player remembers that his dad left him a cabin in the woods, where his family used to go camping to, before the dad died. The player goes to the cabin and sees an old deck of cards that the player and his dad used to build houses of cards with. The deck is old, the cards have lots of creases, which makes them easy to handle, so the player lights a fire in the fireplace, brews some coffee and starts building a house of cards with the old deck.

This introduces the main physics of the game, where the player draws a card, by clicking and dragging it in the appropriate location (which can be highlighted by the hud), use the q and e keys for minor tweaks to set it in place. Once placed, if the card doesn't have any other cards nearby, or is unstable, then there is a hidden timer until the card topples, and you have to quickly, grab another card from the deck to stabilize the first card. After building a base, you can build whatever you want, with the limited amount of cards. The game should be able to build not just up and down, but also in the z-axis as well. Once done, take a photo of the house, with an old camera (just like your mom used to do), then hang it up or save it in an album.

You can revisit these photos to rebuild a previous house or continue building from a previous state. Eventually you can order new decks of cards online to the cabin, but the require mastery or experience with previous decks of cards. New decks will have different perks and nerfs. You can also use different types of materials like blocks of wood to stabalize the cards, but the nerf is that it takes too much space of the build area, there will also be a few decorative pieces to make the house of card look neater.  
  
Eventually, I want it to be a 1-4 player co-op so you can build and play with friends (I have a story idea for this later). Also for a ""traditional campaign"" there are a bunch of previous old pictures that you find of houses you built with your parents, that you can replicate. Building these unlocks previous memories of the player when they were young, slowly going through your father's death, what happened after, and eventually your mother's death too.  
  
All the while in the background, you cycle through day, night, rain, snow, etc. Which you can change by sleeping in the bed.  

I would love to bring this idea to life, but I am not a game dev, so if anyone wants to help me out, that would be great. We can also start a kickstarter with a basic game demo, to see if anyone is interested.

Here is the life I’m trying to find.

There is a snowstorm rolling in. We are stuck inside but it’s okay because the sourdough I’ve been engineering like medieval technology is finally in the oven. We are reading. Maybe it’s *Autonomous* or *Oryx and Crake* or we are re-reading *Dark Matter* and arguing about whether the dystopian tech is a prediction or a warning. The conversation spirals. We start talking about plot holes and end up at 2 a.m. debating the nature of consciousness or why the ocean looks so terrifying at night.

Then we head outside. We are hiking a trail that isn't on the map anymore or chasing a coastline or just driving to a nowhere town because I found a diner that’s worth the gas money. I’m photographing the storm clouds and you are picking the music. It’s quiet but it’s the comfortable kind of quiet where we don't need to fill the air just to hear ourselves talk.

Things that keep me busy include dialing in my coffee routine with scientific precision and tinkering with electronics until I over-optimize them. I spend a lot of time consuming sci-fi until reality starts feeling like foreshadowing and debating nonsense with alarming sincerity.

I’m looking for someone genuine with a real inner life and a little bit of darkness of their own. You should be capable of intensity when it matters. I want someone who wants to look at the night sky and share a dry joke and build something that is slow and real.

There were signs directing us to go down. I think we reached lower ground level three, like a basement. There were elevator like doors, and I saw fire. I heard that if we wanted to be saved, we had to get burned and endure it. If we were ready, we could enter the door that looked like an elevator, At that moment, I was trembling with fear. I heard painful screaming behind the fire, and my college classmate was willing to go there to be saved.

Not saying this to flex (ok maybe a tiny bit), just to give context, this is stuff that comes from actual reps, real campaigns and a lot of burned inboxes.

And what’s funny is that even really good outreach specialists still miss a lot of super basic things.

Nothing groundbreaking, just small habits that compound like crazy if you actually use them.

Here’s the list( hope it saves someone a few months of pain and a couple thousand spam complaints)

1/ PS personalization still slaps. +30-40% easily, but don’t end your email like you’re proposing marriage. No ‘can we schedule a 30 min call to discuss synergies’, Just start a convo, that’s it.

2/ Write like a normal human. 6th grade English beats ‘leveraging cross-functional solutions’ every single time. If your email sounds like a Deloitte slide, it’s already dead.

3/ All lowercase helps you stand out in a sea of capitalized corporate PTSD. Exclamation marks in subject lines do the opposite. Nothing screams ‘I’m spam’ like ‘Quick question!!!’

4/ Keep it short. Mobile first - 70%+ people open on their phone while half awake. If your email is longer than 150 words, you already lost them somewhere between the toilet and the coffee machine, so 150 words max is the sweet spot.

5/ Format matters. F-shape, skimmable, white space. If your email looks like Terms & Conditions, no one is reading it.

6/ Use ‘you’ more than ‘I’. No one cares about your story arc, this isn’t Netflix.

7/ Avoid templates you found on Google. If it ranks #1, congrats, 1000 other reps are using the same sh\*t and your prospect has already seen it 12 times this week.

8/ Preview text is underrated, people decide if they open based on 2 lines. Wasting it on ‘My name is’ is like using the first 5 seconds of a YouTube ad to say ‘Hi guys’

9/ Only reach out when you actually have a reason, if your WHY is ‘we sell X’, just don’t.

10/ Relevancy > personalization. Personalization without relevance is just creepy.

11/ Social proof works, but be realistic. ‘Google did this’ doesn’t help a 10-person startup, it just makes you look clueless.

12/ Don’t turn your email into a math exam, 1-2 numbers max - no one wants to solve your KPI puzzle.

13/ CTAs should be soft. ‘Worth exploring?’ beats ‘Can we hop on a 30 min call this week?’ every day n don’t forget the gold rule - ONE CTA per email!!! More than that and people freeze like a deer in headlights and do nothing.

That’s pretty much it. Sorry if some of this sounded a bit blunt or rude, but let’s be honest - life is blunt, inboxes are brutal, and nobody owes us replies.

If even a couple of these tips help you book one extra meeting, hit quota, or just stop getting ignored by strangers on the internet, then this post did its job.

The La Crosse County Dems building will be open and have coffee/hot chocolate available and will be open if people need signs/buttons/bathroom breaks or just to warm up for a few minutes. 

We will pull through these times by caring for one another. Just as Alex Pretti did and many other are still able to do. Let's show Alex that La Crosse cares. 

In additon to abolishing ICE, it would be wonderful to see neighbors helping neighbors, singing, chanting, and rejoicing at the top of our lungs, loud enough for MN to hear that we love and support them. ",49,1769446055.0,lacrossewi,4,0.83,False

* Have you ever wondered about the lives of the people who were here before you? At West Point on the Eno, explore the complex histories of our own backyard. West Point on the Eno is not your typical historical site. It's not a battleground for major wars, nor the birthplace of presidents. Instead, it's a vivid tapestry of everyday yet extraordinary lives from Durham's past. Here, the routine of mill workers, the creativity of people like photographer Hugh Mangum, and the stories within the historic house are discovered and shared. These are tales of ordinary people whose lives, like yours, are extraordinary in their own right. Discover a different kind of history at West Point on the Eno, where the extraordinary is found in the ordinary. Take a guided walking tour of West Point on the Eno's historic park.
* Tours leave on the hour at 12 pm, 1 pm, 2 pm, and 3 pm. Registration is required. Dogs are allowed on hikes but are not permitted inside historic buildings unless a registered service animal.

# Running Art Exhibits



[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof Exhibition: Life of Service**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/jordan-abdur-raoof-exhibition-life-of-service/) at **Durham Visitor Information Center 🫶**

* Photographer Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof has transformed the Visitor Info Center to an ode to Durham hospitality. His exhibition, [Life is Service](https://www.lifeisservice.space/), highlights community, connection, and hospitality, showcasing people from beloved local businesses. Add a stop to the Visitor Info Center to check off a [Love Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/love-durham/) spot as part of the Creative Challenge!
* The Visitor Info Center is open every Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-5pm.
* Free
* Through Feb. 28

[**Winter**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/winter-at-5-points-gallery-members-exhibit/) at **5 Points Gallery**

* 5 Points Gallery is pleased to present Winter at 5 Points: Gallery Members Exhibit, bringing together new and recent works from the gallery’s member artists in a winter presentation shaped by distinct voices, materials, and ways of seeing. The exhibition moves from intuitive and outsider-influenced expressions to layered abstraction, imaginative figurative scenes, nature-inspired painting, fused glass work, and the refined craftsmanship of finely made furniture. Subtle threads of empowerment, heritage, connection to the natural world, and messages of peace and care for others emerge throughout, creating a sense of continuity across otherwise varied practices. Seen together, these works invite viewers to linger and experience the depth and richness of the artists’ creative worlds.
* Join in for the Third Friday Reception on January 16 from 6–9pm as part of Durham’s Third Friday Art Walk. Meet the artists and experience this seasonal exhibition.
* Visit 5 Points Gallery in person or online. All work from the exhibition is available for shipping or pickup. Gallery hours are Thursdays and Fridays 5–9pm and Saturdays 1–9pm. Artists are available to talk about their work.
* Free
* January 16-Feb 14

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* January 4- July 19

[**Art Exhibition — Labor&Materials and The Intuitionist**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/exhibition-opening-reception-labor-materials-and-the-intuitionist-2/) at **21c Museum Hotel Durham**

The exhibitions feature a thematic group exhibition of 67 multi-media artworks by 40 artists from across the globe exploring the evolution of industry and labor in the 21st century and a two-person exhibition of paintings by Atlanta-based artist Xavier Daniels and Toronto-based artist Natia Lemay.

1qnl5om,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qnl5om/why_loving_an_introvert_might_be_the_smartest/,Why Loving an INTROVERT Might Be the Smartest Relationship Move (Science-Backed),"Been researching relationship psychology for months now (books, podcasts, research papers, the works) and honestly? The data on introvert partnerships is wild. Society pushes this extrovert ideal so hard that we've basically gaslit ourselves into thinking quiet = boring or antisocial = damaged. But here's the thing, after diving into attachment theory, communication studies, and interviewing actual couples, I realized introverts bring something to relationships that's genuinely rare. This isn't about one personality type being ""better"" it's about understanding what makes certain connections work so damn well.

**Deep conversations come naturally.** Small talk drains introverts but meaningful dialogue energizes them. Dr. Laurie Helgoe's research in ""Introvert Power"" shows introverts process information more thoroughly in their prefrontal cortex, which means they're literally wired for depth over breadth. You know those 2am conversations where you discuss everything from childhood fears to what happens after death? That's their comfort zone. They're not killing time with surface level BS, they want to understand who you actually are. Reading Helgoe's book completely shifted how I saw communication styles. She's got a PhD in psychology and spent years studying introversion, this woman knows her stuff. The book breaks down why introverts think differently and it's genuinely fascinating.

**They're incredibly observant.** Because introverts spend more time watching than performing, they notice things others miss. Your mood shifts, the specific way you like your coffee, that story you mentioned once three months ago. ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain talks about how introverts excel at reading social cues and picking up on emotional subtleties. It's not magic, it's just that they're not too busy broadcasting to receive. Cain's book became a massive bestseller for good reason, she draws on neuroscience and psychology to explain why our culture undervalues introversion. Honestly one of the most validating reads if you've ever felt misunderstood for being quiet.

**Independence isn't threatening, it's expected.** Introverts need alone time to recharge, which means they genuinely understand when you need space too. There's less of that clingy anxiety because solitude isn't abandonment, it's maintenance. This creates healthier boundaries naturally. The Attachment Project (website/resource) has amazing content on secure attachment styles, and spoiler alert, respecting autonomy while maintaining connection is literally the foundation of secure relationships. They've got articles, quizzes, and research backed tools for understanding your attachment patterns.

**Loyalty runs deep.** Introverts are selective about who they let into their inner circle, so if you're in, you're really in. They don't collect surface level friendships or need constant social validation. Research from evolutionary psychology suggests introverts form fewer but significantly stronger bonds. When an introvert commits, they're not one foot out the door scanning for upgrades. They've already done the mental work of deciding you're worth their limited social energy.

**They're amazing listeners.** Not the nodding along while planning what to say next type of listening, actual active listening. Introverts process internally, so they absorb what you're saying without the compulsion to immediately react or fix it. The podcast ""The Art of Charm"" did an entire series on communication skills and repeatedly emphasized that introverts naturally excel at the ""listening to understand vs listening to respond"" thing most people have to consciously learn.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it generates adaptive learning plans tailored to your goals and struggles.

The app lets you customize everything, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples. You can also pick voices that match your mood, whether that's something calm and soothing or more energetic to keep you engaged during a commute. There's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges, and it recommends content that fits your learning style. It's been helpful for understanding relationship psychology patterns and communication strategies without having to hunt down every book separately.

**Comfortable silence exists.** You can just be together without performing or filling every gap with noise. Sitting in the same room doing separate things feels intimate, not awkward. This might sound small but it's actually huge for long term compatibility. When the honeymoon phase fades and you're just existing in shared space, that comfort becomes everything.

**Thoughtfulness over grand gestures.** Introverts show love through considered actions rather than performative displays. They remember what matters to you because they actually paid attention. Less about expensive surprises, more about the book they saw that reminded them of your favorite author or planning a quiet evening because they know you've been overwhelmed.

**Lower tolerance for drama.** Introverts generally hate conflict for conflict's sake and unnecessary chaos. They're not going to blow up your phone, start fights in public, or thrive on emotional volatility. Dating can feel calm instead of like a constant rollercoaster. Obviously healthy conflict resolution matters, but there's something peaceful about being with someone who doesn't manufacture problems for entertainment.

The biological and social factors shaping how introverts operate in relationships aren't flaws, they're just different operating systems. Neither introversion nor extroversion is superior, but understanding these patterns helps you appreciate what you're actually getting. If you want depth, loyalty, and someone who treats your inner world with genuine curiosity, loving an introvert makes perfect sense.

1qnl4u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qnl4u7/i_failed_my_wife_and_it_hurts/,I Failed my Wife and it Hurts,"8 months out since my (37m) STBXW (34f) filed for divorce. We were together 10 years, married 5. No children.

Background: In the beginning of 2025, she started taking a GLP-1 medication for weight loss. She struggled with weight, although I always found her attractive. I was always thinner than her. Again, didn't bother me one bit. The weight came off rapidly. I was supportive and happy for her. Then.... weird comments and behavior followed after a few months.

It started subtle. ""Hey, a guy bought me coffee today on the way to work, he said I was beautiful"". If I remember, in that coffee scenario I probably said ""haha that's great you deserve it!"". Side note, I always told my wife she was beautiful.

Month or so leading up to divorce is when things escalated. Both of these comments happened immediately after we had sex. She shared with me a fantasy of hers where I watch her have sex with another man. I shot it down. Few weeks later, again, right after sex, she shared with me enthusiastically that her male co-worker told her he masturbates to the thought of her. I was in shock.

Shortly after this, we had dinner together at a restaurant. I remember my arms being around her as we waited for a table. Everything seemed cool. I had a deployment coming up (I am in the National Guard). She had experienced a 7 month deployment with me in 2021 already. She told me I should get a ""hall-pass"" to mess around with other women while gone. I remember being in shock. I told her heck no, I have too much integrity for that and I have seen many relationships ruined in the military because of that. IIRC, she laughed it off ""only joking!"".

The next day, I left for a weekend solo motorcycle trip I had planned. I do one every year. I Facetimed with her when I got to the hotel, all seemed fine. At around 10pm, my phone chimes off that the Ring/Blink cameras on my home picked up her leaving the house. The phone chimed again at 1:30am her coming back home. Very unlike her. Now, I am very suspicious due to all the bizarre comments mentioned above. As I toss/turn thinking of what to say, I go to re-watch the footage. She deleted it all. I sent her a text asking what was going on. She gave a BS excuse that made no sense, love bombed me excessively and said she was not cheating on me. She confessed she has had more male attention, but it was all just ""fantasy"".

I came home from the trip, expecting to have a conversation about it all. Instead, I saw a woman I didn't even recognize. She was stone cold, emotionless. ""I have been unhappy for a while; I am filing for divorce"".

That was it. She wouldn't confess to anything and didn't give me specific reasons other than she felt like she was taken for granted and she didn't feel loved. She had no desire to fix anything.

I truly believe I failed my wife. I look back on the last year or so of our marriage and I did get complacent. We did do dates once a week, but she was planning the majority of them. We had a trip that was scheduled after she filed for divorce (cancelled obviously), that she planned. I loved her so much, but I believe my love for her in the end wasn't received in a way she wanted. For example, I remember one of my last things I did was remove a dent from her car. She backed into a pole at work and was super upset about it. As soon as she came home, I went right outside with my dent puller kit and went to work. I worked for hours on that dent. I'm not sure I got a thank you.

She brought up a time I bought her a gift years ago. I remember making a trail of flower petals to the gift outside. She said it wasn't about the gift, but about the thought and effort put into it.

I fell into routine and didn't realize she built up so much resentment to the point where she most likely cheated in some way.

She treated me horribly during the month she moved to the spare bedroom, posting things like ""postbreakupglowup"" to her social media.... almost celebrating the divorce. That really hurt. She also admitted to going on a date the weekend after she filed.

I'm not sure I would still be in this position if I were more in-tune with her emotional needs. I think between my complacency and her newfound confidence with the weight loss, factor in some new male validation and it was over.

I have major regret.

Has anyone here dealt with something similar? I'm trying to learn what I can do better if I ever get into another relationship again.

1qnl3wu,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1qnl3wu/feeling_the_puppy_blues/,feeling the puppy blues,"hi everyone this is my first post here. 

we have a 9 week old border collie pup. we got him last week from an animal rescue and today we got to officially adopt him. 

i love him, and i am happy we adopted him but im feeling so down and i dont know why. 

he’s really smart, he has basically already learnt how to sit, he is almost potty trained and he sleeps in his crate at night plus has enforced naps in the crate during the day. he is the ideal puppy in regards to training. 

but, the biting is insane. i don’t know how to keep him entertained, he has loads of toys, he has toys for mental stimulation, we do short training exercises throughout the day, we enforce naps in his crate when he’s overstimulated but he just wants to bite all the time. he will bite us, the furniture and try bite the cat also. 

we are trying to redirect him to toys but he gets really fixated on the one thing he can’t have and will bark/bite if he doesn’t get it. 

he also keeps trying to take stuff off the coffee table, we will tell him no and redirect him but he gets very snappy and bites. 

i’m starting to question if adopting him was a good idea. i worry that if i can’t mentally stimulate him now, how will i be able to once he’s older and needs more. 

i had a siberian husky for 12 years until she passed in 2024 so haven’t had a puppy in a long time. 

any advice would be appreciated. ",5,1769445538.0,puppy101,7,1.0,False

1qnl2qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qnl2qy/repelsteeltje/,Repelsteeltje,"Back in 2011, I did my Erasmus in Leeuwarden - a small town in the north of Netherlands. First time I arrived there, getting off the train station, I thought that I was in Sesame Street, such cleanliness.

I was 25, in my prime years. I went there with great expectations as a third year university student from Turkey. The experience that I had there surpassed far far beyond my expectations. 

There was this amazing coffee shop we used to call our second home among our friends: Repelsteeltje. Three floors, all wood, smelling like coffee and you know what. It was so chill, so easy-going at any time during the day or evening. You could see the good times that you were going to have before you were about to walk in through the window from people's faces that were sitting in the coffee shop, you could almost hear conversations from the street, feel the warmth.

One Sunday, we were once again sitting with friends, having a good time in Repelsteeltje, a band of four people started set up their instruments out of nowhere. After 20 minutes of their setup, they started playing. A keyboard, a guitarist, a drummer and bass player were in the band. They all played kind of this jazz genre varying from contemporary to oriental jazz - the bass player also had a contrabass. Since we were above the clouds thanks to the music and the herbs, it felt like you could actually swim above the music.

Days passed, I am at my dorm, having just finished to take a shower, the door bell rang. I opened the door and there is this guy with his guitar at the door. Since my roommate was absent at the time, I had to open the door. The guy who is at the door is the same guy who played at that small concert in Repelsteeltje. One thing I have to add here is that I was living with a Malaysian roommate at the time who played really good guitar and amazing bass guitar. Since I was also a bass guitarist (thanks to my father), my roommate and I used to jam together whenever we came together, and the guy at the door was invited to our dorm by my roommate to jam together but I didn't know that and he wasn't at home when he came!

I invited him inside and told him about the small concert that they performed in Repelsteeltje and how I loved their performance and they were in sync, passed each other the solo notes... I had this Squire 5 strings bass guitar that I bought from a second hand shop when I was there to feed my hunger for my music side. We jammed a bit together until my roommate came, he taught me things that, to this day I still remember. 

This nostalgic moment came to my mind for no reason when I picked up my bass guitar to play Cake's Long Line of Cars for no reason and I just wanted to share with someone.

Caesar still had his head buried in a book. The bus jolted, its doors opening with a rough thud.

An announcement followed:

“Fairweather College. Please alight carefully.”

Caesar caught the announcement and closed his book to deboard. As he was about to put his foot down—

“Attention everyone, Julius Caesar is arriving!” shouted a guy with round spectacles and twitchy eyes, adjusting his glasses with his forefinger on the bridge of his nose.

“Hey, Joseph,” Caesar replied awkwardly.

“So, what’s on your reading list, Mr. Prince?”

“I just picked up a random book from my grandpa’s collection. I’m still trying to grasp it.”

“Come on, man! Get some real fun in the outside world. You need real experiences. And it’s Professor Harrison’s lecture today. I guess we should grab some coffee to survive.”

Caesar was not efficient at keeping casual conversations. He preferred meaningful talks. He mostly listened to whatever Joseph was saying, nodding and offering an awkward smile in between.

The college environment felt like a flock of birds—people gossiping, couples sitting around like lovebirds. Caesar was nerdy, but smart enough to blend in.

They reached the classroom door, which opened with a squeaky noise as they stepped inside the lecture hall. The board read:

“The Philosophy of Time”

“We can never feel the present. What we feel is the delayed present,” the professor said.

A voice came from somewhere in the class:

“Just like Caesar and Joseph,” it chuckled, “always a little late—just like time itself.”

A sudden wave of laughter flowed through the classroom.

“Silence!” the professor shouted.

Both Caesar and Joseph put their heads down, found their bench, and settled in.

“This must be that freak, Sandy. What does he think he is? Loser shithead.”

“Hey, cool down,” Caesar said, locking his attention onto the professor’s lecture—just like he had been locked into his book earlier that day.

The professor continued teaching, words filling the board as chalk squeaked against it. Caesar was oddly fond of such sounds. Meanwhile, Joseph shook his leg, scanning the classroom out of boredom. His attention span was like maize in a popcorn oven—bursting randomly and changing constantly.

As the class ended and students began to shuffle out, Caesar lingered in his seat. The last words of Professor Harrison echoed faintly in his mind:

""We can never feel the present. What we feel is always delayed. Time is both a friend and a stranger.""

Caesar thought about the voice in the class, the joke about him and Joseph, and the strange rhythm of the lecture. Everything felt… layered, as if the world itself were slightly behind him, always a moment ahead, always out of reach.",1,1769445286.0,writers,1,1.0,False

Night came again, and despite our collective trepidation, we decided to tie down and make camp. As a precaution, Quillo poured a salt ring around our spot, and we all said a prayer of protection before we reconfigured our watch rotation. I picked up the slack we had from being down a man and took the first and last watch— It wasn’t like I’d be sleeping much that night anyway.

First watch came and went, and as soon as I laid down to sleep, it was suddenly time for last watch. The first hour went as well as you could hope a watch to go. It wasn’t too cold and Quillo had made a fantastic pot of coffee for me during his watch, and it had made a great companion as I sat there and quietly watched Scraps mumble and twitch like a madman.

As I crept into the second hour, the pot had gone empty, and as I crept further in, I could feel my eyelids beginning to go leaden. I splashed some water in my face but it had only a short effect. There was maybe only forty-five minutes ‘til first light, I just had to hang on. I just had to— I jolted awake. *Shit.* How long had I been out? I gathered myself for a moment and then froze. Scraps was gone. I jumped to my feet and looked around frantically. The only thing I saw in the firelight was Quillo, Teo and our horses.

“Scraps!” I called out into the black abyss. Quillo and Teo sat up. “Scraps is gone!” I shouted at them. “Mount up! We need to go find em!” I jogged over to my horse and fished my lantern and a box of matches out of my saddlebag.

“We should wait for first light, Bodie.” Teo said. His suggestion boiled my blood. Wait? Scraps was somewhere out in the dark in the worst condition I’d ever seen him in, to hell with waiting.

I gave Teo a sharp look. “I said *mount up,* dammit.”

We trotted out into the dark calling out for Scraps with no way of knowing if he was close by, or even alive. We had rode about three miles south of camp when daylight finally broke, and that’s when I spotted him. I wasn’t too sure at first if it was him or not, but as we drew closer there was nothing left to doubt. There was Scraps— Dead, with his pistol in his hand and a oozing, bloody hole in his head.

I’d never felt anger like I’d felt looking down at my fallen friend. It was the same kind of anger a bear might feel with his foot caught in a trap, watching a man approach with a rifle in his hand. I was stuck in this shit and I wanted out, God almighty I wanted out, and it was starting to look like there was only *one way* out of this mess we found ourselves in.

We decided to bury Scraps there in the desert, we didn’t need any more angry spirits out for us. We tied a couple sticks into a cross and plunged it into the head of his grave, then said some prayers. After that was all said and done, we headed back to camp to continue our trek west. As we rode on, I glanced over my shoulder at the horse and empty saddle that now rode with us. It was strange to not see Scraps in it, and I felt somewhat responsible for him not being there. Something else caught my eye, off in the distance that same coyote padded quickly after us. We had to get to that bruja, it was our only chance.

 

VIII

 

As the sun crowned the blue sky above us, we came to a large prairie flanked on all sides by gently sloping hills with patches of greasewood and sage pocking the vast expanse of empty grassland. We carefully navigated across the deceptively flat terrain. I winced every time one of our horses stumbled over a loose rock or marmot hole, the last thing we needed was for our horses to go down. We could spare one since we had an empty saddle, even then though moving everything over onto a new horse would cost us time that I didn’t want to spend.

My stomach rumbled like thunder. We hadn’t eaten breakfast that morning, and I wasn’t planning on making a stop for lunch. If we wanted to eat, we’d do it on the go. The spirit that pursued us had put its will into motion. It already took the life of Scraps, or compelled him to do it himself, so now every minute mattered. Time spent doing anything other than moving further west—was time we were handing over to malevolence.

“How much further?” I asked Teo. I wiped my sleeve across my brow as the afternoon sun began to beat down on us.

Teo shielded his eyes and looked up at the sky to get a fix on the sun’s position. “If we make camp again at sundown, we could be there mid-morning tomorrow, I reckon.”

“You think we could ride through the night?” I pulled my horse to the right to avoid a loose shelf of dirt and rock. “I have a thought that this thing can only afflict us when we sleep. It came for Scraps in his sleep, and now that he’s gone it’s gonna come for its next target. Maybe if we stay awake, we can buy ourselves time until we get to the village.”

“Maybe.” Teo clicked his tongue. He pointed at the hills off in the distance in front of us. “We got another stretch of prairie to cross after them hills yonder.” He brought his hand down and gripped his saddle horn. “Through that prairie, we’ll hit a road on the other side. If we can get to that road before dark, I’d say we’d be fine riding through the night.”

I nodded and felt some relief spring up in my chest. Maybe this nightmare would be over. I scanned the hillside and suddenly felt the embers of hope get snuffed out. A little ahead of us on a hilltop on our right flank sat that same coyote. Now, I’m sure there are thousands of yotes in the desert, but somehow, I knew this was the same one that had been following us. As we drew closer the yote didn’t yip or scamper, he just sat there staring at us with hate in his eyes.

Suddenly that dream I had flooded back into my mind. I was once again stuck in the ground and helpless. A dense fog surrounded me and I watched as Scraps appeared out of it, sitting on a pale horse and wrapped in a black cloak. I heard the screech of the owl off to my right but dared not look. A watery groan drew my eyes upward and there Santiago was, sitting atop a ghastly steed. The skin on his face was beginning to peel off, and his empty eye socket was beginning to bubble with puss and decay. He raised up his arm and a rotten grey finger unfolded from his hand.

I followed the direction he was pointing and saw a silhouette of a man on a horse beginning to form from within the fog. I suddenly realized the spirit was showing me who it had selected next. It was taunting me, this was all a game to it. The horseman began to come into view, as I racked my brain trying to remember who the next one in line had been after Scraps. The spirit didn’t make me wait long though, as the man’s face soon came into full view—it was Teo.

“Do y’all hear that?” Quillo’s voice pulled me back to reality. As we pulled our horses to a stop, I glanced up at the hilltop once more but the yote was no longer there. We sat there quietly, and at first I couldn’t pick up on the sound Quillo was talking about, but then I heard it. It sounded like distant thunder except with the steady, unbroken rumble. The rumble started out quiet but grew louder with every passing second.

“What the hell is that?” Teo asked out loud. As if to answer his question, the rumble became even louder and the earth began to shake beneath us sending vibrations up through my horses legs and into my saddle. Our horses became increasingly uneasy and shifted on their feet with quiet whinnys as if begging us to leave. The sound was coming from behind the hills to the south, and as I sat there watching them, it suddenly dawned on me what the sound was.

“Stampede!” I shouted, “Go! Ride now!” Black masses began to crest over the southern hills—buffalo. Everything south of us was quickly swallowed up in a sea of grunts and fur and horn. The herd stretched from one end of the prairie to damn near the other side. I’d never seen so many buffalo in my life and would’ve been struck with awe in any other circumstance.

Soon the rumble had turned into a sound I could only describe as the earth splitting in half. I’d never been caught in the path of a stampede myself, but I’d known one man that had and survived; an old cowboy named Jim Meyer. Jim had told me over drinks one night that a lot of men panic when they see the stampede coming and try to get to the edge of the herd as fast as they can. Jim told he’d seen plenty of men try to make it to the edge, but it never works, and they always end up trampled into the dirt.

He also told me that trying to outrun a buffalo stampede on a horse sounds like it’d be something that would work, but buffalo are a lot faster than they look and can easily overtake a horse in full gallop.

According to Jim Meyer, the only chance to survive is to ride as hard as you can at an angle, and pray you find cover and your horse doesn’t catch a marmot hole before the beasts catch up to you.

We let our spare horse go and yanked on our reigns to angle our horses to the northwest and slammed our heels into their sides until we were all moving at top speed. Much to my relief, I did see a place where we could take refuge. Two large, squared pillars of rocky outcrop lied ahead of us like a city gate to some strange forgotten place, and a scattering of small, grey boulders lay between us and the two pillars. For a moment I considered hunkering down behind the boulders but quickly tossed the idea away. The boulders weren’t large enough to give us and our horses cover, and the last thing we needed is one of those beasts catching its horn on our only way out of this hell.

“The pillars!” I called out to my men, “get to the stone pillars!”

Teo rode up ahead of me and Quillo wasn’t too far behind us, the rhythm of hooves on dirt matched perfectly with pounding of my heart. I glanced back and was horrified to see that the buffalo had gained on us to the point that I could see the glisten in their eyes and make out the uniqueness in their capes. I drove my heels into my horse once more, but he was already moving as quickly as his body would allow. The buffalo drew closer behind us and the rocky gate drew closer in front, if we were gonna make it, it was gonna be by a hair thread.

And then it happened.

Right before we reached the first boulder, Teo’s horse caught its foot in a marmot hole — or something— and sent Teo flying out of his saddle while his horse tumbled violently to the ground. Before I had any time to react my horse slammed into Teo’s. It felt as though time had slowed as my horse reared up and I somehow managed to hang on and stay in the saddle as me and him spiraled down to the ground. The beast landed on its side with a loud crack, and I wailed loudly as pain shot up my leg that was now trapped beneath a thousand pounds worth of animal. It was broke, I knew it right away.

The cries from Teo’s horse and mine filled the air, joining the thunderous rumble of the stampede creating a hellish harmony. I tried to push and pull myself out from under my horse and screamed in agony as I inched my leg to freedom. Darkness filled the edges of my vision as the pain seared through my entire body, my leg felt like it was being held together by only a thread or two but I knew I had to keep trying. For what though? It’s not like I was gonna hobble to safety, I was a dead man. I knew my effort was futile, but if these were my last moments before meeting my maker—I wasn’t gonna spend them quivering underneath my horse.

To my shock and relief, I finally pulled myself free. I rolled onto my side with a grunt and used my horse—who was still lying on his side crying in pain—to pull myself up onto my one good leg. It was my time, and I wanted to go standing upright so I could stare death in the face.

Dust floated up around the buffalo and hung like smoke as they continued to charge forward. I looked to my right, and off in the distance I saw Teo lying face down in the dirt; motionless and surely dead. I looked over at the rocky gate. Funny thinking back on it now, my stone refuge was so close, but in that moment it looked miles away. As I looked on, that coyote came into view and sat in between the two massive towers of stone, like a sentry guarding his king’s palace. As I watched him guard his keep, everything around him started to blur until it was completely out of focus and it was only me and him there in that prairie. We stared into each other’s eyes for what felt like an eternity, and a feeling washed over me like a breeze on a hot summer day. It wasn’t anger I felt, nor was it dread. No, I felt at peace. I was ready to go. A smile crept across my face, and I gave the coyote a nod and I could’ve sworn he nodded back at me.

*You got us, you won.*

“Bodie!” The thud of hooves came up from behind me. I propped myself up on my horse and turned to see Quillo still in his saddle. He trotted up to me and reached his hand out to me. “Grab on! Hurry!” I’d never heard Quillo so frantic.

A part of me was happy to see Quillo, but there was a small part of me that was angry that he had disrupted a beautiful death for me. Strange, I know, but that’s how I’d felt. I looked back towards the rocky gate, the coyote was gone. Maybe he had never been there.

“Bodie! Dammit grab my arm!”

With some reluctance, I turned to face him, wincing and snarling the entire time. I took a couple of jumps forward and fell into his horse. I grabbed his saddle with one hand and held tightly to his arm with the other and pulled myself up since I couldn’t rely on my bad leg to boost me up and toyed with the stirrup with the toe of my boot until I was able to get a good purchase. I pushed up on the stirrup while Quillo pulled me up, and we did it with enough force I was able to swing my dead leg over his horse. The pain was terrible, but it was better than dying.

We rode hard towards the two rocky pillars, passing Teo’s body on the way, and made it to safety with only moments to spare. Quillo steadied his horse in between the two pillars and I felt like someone had dumped a bucket of relief over my head. That relief was short lived though, as I looked back the way we came to see Teo miraculously stagger to his feet— only to disappear seconds later behind a wall of dust, shaggy fur and muscle.

 We were soon surrounded on both sides by an unending sea of grunting, stinking buffalo. I could feel the earth shaking all around me, and the loud rumble they all made running at full speed was both magnificent and terrifying. Quillo continued to calm and steady his horse, which was stamping its hooves nervously and stepping back and forth like it wanted to bolt but wasn’t sure if it should. I imagined the horse taking off and plunging us all into the heart of the stampede. Would I have time to yell out before one of those buffalo put its hoof through my skull? Would I feel pain? Or would I be dead before the trampling really got going?

After what seemed like an unnaturally long stretch of time, the last of the buffalo passed and the prairie was quiet again. The dust began to settle and soon the only remnants of the stampede were the cries from our wounded horses, and Teo’s trampled body.

I wish I could say that I felt sorrow for Teo like I had for Scraps; but I didn’t. I didn’t feel anything. Not from a lack of caring, I was just numb. Our journey west was starting to feel more hopeless. We weren’t pitted up against some tinhorn spirit; this thing was a force of nature. The only chance we had would be the one it gave us, if ever it did. I started thinking that maybe we should just wait where we were and face our fate.

I took a deep breath and grimaced as a slight adjustment I made in the way I was sitting sent a surge of pain shooting up my leg. It was about that time that I felt it again, that same feeling I had felt back in Rocha Gorge. It was like suddenly a million hidden eyes were watching me. Watching with disdain, and revenge on their mind. The feeling made me forget all about my leg, and I could feel gooseflesh start to crawl down my arms. I wasn’t even sure what I was looking for, but I started tracking my eyes across our surroundings. On the other side of the two stony pillars was hillside with a mishmash of rugged boulders and fingers of bedrock crawling up it. I followed the path of rubble and jagged stone until my eyes fell on a large boulder about halfway up, and I froze. There sitting in front of the boulder was that damn coyote again. I swear that creature smiled at me in that moment. It was a smile of sick satisfaction. I don’t know how I knew that— I just did. And then right before my eyes it disappeared into whisps of smoke on the wind. That’s when I heard Quillo call out.

“We got people comin’,” he said, “Apache.”

Quillo quickly dismounted and led me and his horse back behind the left tower, out of sight of the prairie. He pulled his repeater out of his elk-skin saddle scabbard and started quickly thumbing rounds into the side gate. Seeing Apache after witnessing a buffalo stampede meant only one thing, we were on Apache hunting ground, and that was about the last place you wanted to be if you weren’t Apache yourself.  I don’t know if there is a word for when a man’s situation goes from dire to worse— but that was right where we were.

“Help me down, dammit.” I growled quietly. Quillo slung his rifle over his shoulder and gingerly guided me down off his horse. I nearly bit my lip right in half trying to keep from screaming as fire ripped through my leg the whole way down. He hooked my arm around his shoulders and I continued to bite down on my lip until I could taste blood as he helped me hobble over to the inside edge of the pillar situated to the left. He helped me prop my back up against the rough surface of the pillar and then Quillo got down on his belly and leveled his weapon out from the edge of the pillar, muzzle facing the prairie.

I pulled my iron out of its holster and inspected the cylinder to make sure I was ready to fight, because it was a fight we were about to have unless we got extremely lucky— which seemed very unlikely at this point. I walked my shoulders across the gritty stone to get a little closer to the edge and slowly peaked out. Four of the Apache were on horseback, and all four of them carried rifles. The four horsemen all wore long braids and feathered headdresses, with colorful tunics and buffalo-hide pants. Four more Apache were on foot and walked in front of the four horsemen. Those four Apache were dressed a lot more simply, wearing just buffalo-hide pants and simple braids in their hair. The Apache, who were on foot, carried only bows and had quivers full of arrows on their hips.

My palms began to sweat as the eight of them came closer and closer. I found myself praying to God that they would just continue on after that buffalo herd and leave us be. Maybe they would. What good would it do them to bother with two dusty travelers, anyhow?

One of the Apache footmen craned his neck then turned to his companions and called something out to them, stopping the entire party. That footman then continued slowly forward by himself craning and bobbing his head like he was trying to get a good look at something. That something was my horse.

My jaw tensed and I slowly moved my iron to the edge of the rocky tower and set my sights on the man as best I could in my condition. He cautiously moved closer to it then knelt down beside it. He sat there for a moment; I couldn’t tell what he was doing but it looked like he might have been petting my horse. He briefly scanned the prairie then waved his companions over. The eight men grouped up and their voices carried gently in the air as they discussed their find and what it could mean —Or at least that’s what I assumed they were going on about— The same footman that had spotted my horse broke away from the group and inspected Teo’s horse then started walking towards where Teo lied dead.

I don’t know if that Apache saw a glint off my six-shooter or spotted Quillo’s face amongst the brush and rubble, but the man stopped dead in his tracks after about ten steps and stared right at us.

*Turn around, boy. Just turn around and go.*

I tightened my grip around my shooter. I could feel my nostrils flaring as I looked into his steely black eyes. Then just like that, he confirmed to himself that he had seen what he thought he saw— and that was us.

The Apache footman shouted something mid-turn and started running back towards his group. The sudden report from Quillo’s rifle sent a jolt up my body and rung my ears. The Apache crumpled to the ground in a gravely skid. The other Apache readied their weapons and began shouting and pointing in every direction. They had no idea where the shot had come from. We had the upper hand; for now.

Another shot from Quillo’s repeater rattled my ribcage and I watched as one of the horsemen slumped forward and slid heavily off his horse. The Apache knew where we were now, just not precisely where we were posted. The remaining footmen nocked arrows and sent a volley zipping right over Quillo’s head. I could feel the whip from the fletchings as they flew by and thumped into the earth behind us.

The remaining horsemen frantically dismounted as the footmen fired another volley in our direction. One of the horsemen got his foot stuck in his stirrup and as he kicked and fought with the damned tack, Quillo leveled his weapon on him and sent a shot right through his heart. At this rate, I started thinking Quillo was gonna kill all these Apache before I even got a chance at one. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a hell of a marksman, but my ol’ Henry was in my *own* saddle scabbard that was now well out of reach. Those Apache were well out of range of my six-shooter, and I didn’t wanna waste any bullets I might need when they got into range.

The remaining Apache scrambled towards the boulders that sat across from us. They disappeared behind the large grey stones, and suddenly what could have been a slaughter had turned into a fight. Two of the Apache peeked out of their cover with rifles ready and I moved away from the edge just in time to see dust and fragmented rock fly up from where I had been just a moment ago. It seemed they had a better idea as to where we were, but I was convinced they still didn’t know *exactly* where we were. Another two blasts from Quillo’s repeater confirmed it for me. He hadn’t budged an inch, if they saw us, they would’ve hit him with that last volley.

I gritted my teeth as I moved back to peek around the edge. One of the Apache slung lifelessly over his boulder with his rifle sitting muzzle down in the dirt and still clutched in his dead hand. My pulse worked fiercely in my neck as I scanned the boulder patch, waiting for one of those damn Apache to pop up again and take a shot at us. It didn’t happen though; the entire prairie had fallen quiet and still. There wasn’t so much as a whisper or a shout caught on the wind. I could start to feel my body relax but didn’t let it, this fight was far from over. Those Apache were behind those boulders planning their next move, and we had to be ready.

After a few more moments of heavy silence, Quillo slowly backed away from the edge and stood to his feet. His eyes were wild and excited and worried all at once.

“One of em ran off under that last volley, ” he whispered to me, “I took a shot at em, but he got outta range quick,” He sniffed and wiped the sweat off his lips with the back of his hand, “I reckon the runner went to go get help and the others are gonna stay holed up until he gets back with whatever hell he’s bringin’.”

“So, let’s get on your horse and get the hell out of here.” I growled.

Quillo shook his head. “They still got one rifle.” Quillo pulled some rounds out of his satchel and started thumbing them into the repeaters side gate, “We gotta cross into the open to get out of here, and we’d be exposed long enough for them to get a good shot on one of us or worse… My horse.”

“So, we ride out shootin’ to keep their heads down.”  

Quillo looked at me in a way that filled me with dread. I could tell he already had a plan in mind, and I wasn’t gonna like it.

“With you all banged up like you are, I don’t think going out like that would be possible. You’d have to be hangin’ on to me with both arms with how fast we’d be going, and I’ll need to focus on ground, so we don’t end up like Teo.”

“So what then?” I snapped. “We just sit here and wait for them to come and take our scalps?”

Quillo peeked around the edge then looked over at his horse then back at me.

“What?” I demanded. “I know you got some scheme in that head, just say it.”

“You take my horse.” Quillo said. “You take my horse and get the hell out of here.”

I felt my nostrils flare. “And what about you?”

Quillo smiled. “I’ll stay back and make sure your escaped is covered.”

“Hell no,” I snarled, “you’re either comin’ with me are we’re dyin’ here together.”

Quillo put his hand on my shoulder. “I’m already halfway in the grave, Bodie.”

I shoved his hand off me. “Quit talkin’ like that, dammit!” I grimaced as a surge of pain shot up my leg, “we can both get out of her on your horse. We might as well try, worst case we’re dead either way.”

“That’s exactly it, *I’m* dead either way.” Quillo wiped the sweat off his lip and for the first time I saw how sick he really was. His eyes were pale and sunken and carried heavy bags beneath them. His skin was pale and stretched tightly around the bony structures of his face. It was like his life was being slowly dripped out of him and he was nearly empty.

He put his hand on my shoulder once again and gave me a squeeze. I’ll never forget seeing the tears start to streak down his face. “I’ve done a lot of bad in my life, Bodie.” He sniffed, “let me go out doing some good.”

I could feel my eyes begin to burn and I swallowed down my own set of tears.

“Help me up onto your horse.”

Quillo nodded but before he could do anything, I spotted movement over his shoulder. It was an Apache. It suddenly occurred to me that the runner Quillo had taken a shot at wasn’t going to get help, he was finding a way around us. He’d crept down the rubbly path behind us and now stood with an arrow nocked and drawn back.

I don’t remember if I made a sound. I’m sure I tried to warn Quillo somehow. It all happened so fast though. The Apache loosed his arrow and it made a sickening hallow *thump* as it cut through my dear friend’s back and stuck in his chest on the other side. Quillo’s mouth and eyes snapped open wide and he started gulping at the air and wheezing like a man nearly drowned. He clung to me frantically as a red stain began to grow around where the arrowhead stuck out of his chest.

“Quillo!”  My voice cracked with shock and worry as I followed him down onto the ground. He rolled to lay flat on his back, and the arrow protruded further out of his chest and what was left of the shaft behind him broke with a loud snap. I could do nothing but prop myself up on one arm and lay there next to him. Quillo continued to gulp and gasp at the air and streams of blood began to trickle down the edges of his mouth.

The Apache made three shrill cries out in the direction of his companions. I didn’t need to understand their codes or language to understand what he was saying. He got us. I heard his companions call back and the Apache turned his attention to me. His face was full of hate, and he didn’t take his eyes off me as he nocked another arrow. He raised up his bow and drew back, but I had leveled my iron on him and pulled the trigger before he could fire.

I couldn’t tell you where I hit him, or if I even did, but the Apache staggered back sending his arrow flying off to the right. What I did next wasn’t too smart, but Quillo was dying right next to me and that mixed with the helplessness of the situation I was in filled me with rage. I leveled my iron on that damn Apache once more and filled him with every bullet I had left in my cylinder. The Apache staggered for a moment then fell dead on his side.

I turned my attention back to Quillo— he was gone. His body lay there in the dirt looking up at the sky with that same blank dead stare I’d seen a thousand times. This time it was different though, that corpse had been my brother and the only family I felt I ever truly had. My jaw quaked as I tried to keep the tears from coming.

 In the distance I could here the sound of those remaining Apache running to where I was. Quillo’s repeater was on the other side of him, but despite how much I tried I couldn’t reach it. It was at that moment that I had succumb to my fate. I felt a lot like how I did when I was facing that stampede of buffalo, except time wasn’t moving slow this time, and there was no peace. There was going to be a lot of pain and suffering before the end, but at least it would end. I leaned back on my hands and dragged myself until I could feel the stone tower on my back. I fished my silver cigarette case out of my front, but after realizing all my matches were with my horse, I tossed it off to the side.

Soon after, the surviving three Apache came into view. They paid me no mind and surrounded Quillo’s body. They spoke for a moment before the Apache wearing some sort of feathered headband stood over Quillo and removed the arrow out of his body with a sucking pull. He tossed the arrow and pulled a steel knife out of a leather sheath that hung on his hide belt. The Apache grabbed Quillo’s lifeless body by the hair and suddenly took note of me. He smiled fiendishly as he placed his blade on Quillo’s brow. He was overjoyed to have me as an audience for what he was about to do.

I turned my head. I didn’t dare look. I couldn’t. It didn’t matter though, because I could still hear the wet rip of flesh being removed from bone. It was the only sound that could be heard other than grunts and heavy breathing as the Apache worked his blade between Quillo’s skull and scalp. Every scrape and sucking sound sent waves of rage and sick washing over me and by the time he had finished and dropped Quillo’s body to the ground with a dull thud, I was fighting back the urge to vomit.

The feathered Apache and his two footmen whooped and cried once the deed was done then everything fell quiet again. The three Apache then stepped slowly over to where I sat. My body quickly became a furnace as I watched their feet step in front of me, and my jaw was clenched so tight I thought I might break a tooth. I looked up into three pairs of cold dark eyes. Eyes that cared nothing about my predicament. Eyes filled with hate and revenge.

The feathered Apache knelt to meet my eyes and smiled at me again. His face was leathered by years in the sun. His breath was surprisingly unoffensive and his teeth were surprisingly white but crooked. He held up Quillo’s scalp to me and gently danced it in the air side to side, coaxing me to look at it. I refused, choosing instead to keep my eyes fixed on his face.

The feathered Apache’s smile faded into a scowl, and he grabbed me by the hair. I grimaced and thought he might scalp me right there with his bare hands with how tightly he gripped me. He yanked me forward and started barking something at me in Apache and shoved Quillo’s bloody scalp right in my face. I could still smell Quillo’s sweat and pomade as the Apache roughly rubbed my face with the hunk of flesh.

The feathered Apache rose to his feet and ran looped Quillo’s scalp onto his brown hide belt. He motioned towards one of the footmen who had been holding his rifle. The footman extended the rifle out to him but he waved it off and gestured towards the footman’s bow. The footman handed him the bow and an arrow from his quiver, and the feathered Apache turned back to me. He smiled at me again as he took a few steps back and used his bow to point off in the distance. He started to gesturing with his bow and shouting at me, and I didn’t need to speak Apache to understand what he was getting at. He wanted me to run. He wanted to make sport of me.

I probably would’ve ran if I could. I would’ve ran to my dead horse and grabbed my rifle and made quick work of these Apache. That wasn’t an option though, not with a busted leg.

So instead, I sat there as stoically as I possibly could. I’d heard stories of the Apache and Comanche sparing men who’d showed no fear in the face of death. I wasn’t sure if the stories were true or not, but it was the last card I had and I was gonna play it. Best case scenario, they’d kill me quick.

The feathered Apache’s shouts and gestures became angrier as he began to grow frustrated at my defiance. He walked stiffly back towards me and gave me a hard kick in my broken leg. A shrill cry escaped me as the pain ripped through my entire body. I laid my head back on the rough stone behind me and took groaning breaths through clenched teeth. The edges of my sight started to darken like they had when my horse first fell on me, and I once again found myself fighting against the urge to vomit.

The three Apache erupted in laughter, and I felt my hopes of a quick death begin to fade away. The feathered Apache pointed at my leg and chirped at me with words that I was sure were degrading to my manhood. He then regained his composure and stepped back and away from me again. He said something to the footman that held his rifle and the footman handed him another arrow. He spoke some words to his companions and the two footman watched intently as he nocked both arrows onto the bow string. He’d found another way to make sport of me, he was gonna show off his bow skills with a fancy trick.

My time had come. After everything I’d been through in life, I never thought I’d be leave this world as a game to a handful of Apache.

The feathered Apache drew back his bow and the last thing I saw before I closed my eyes was the glint of the metal arrowheads that were about to plunge into my body.

It didn’t come though. Instead, I heard one of the Apache shout something with alarm in his voice. I opened my eyes and saw all three of them turn around to face the rocky hillside. They stood there pointing and whispering amongst each other, periodically shooting glances back at me. The feathered Apache gestured towards Quillo’s horse and one of the footman walked over to it and gently snatched its reigns, while the other footman and the feathered Apache walked over to Quillo’s corpse. The feathered Apache hooked Quillo’s body under the arms and the footman grabbed him by the feet and they carried him over to his horse. They slung my friend over his saddle like he was cargo and looked back at me. The hate and revenge in their eyes had been replaced by something else, and I couldn’t quite place it.

Whatever had caught their attention in the rocks behind them seemed to have spooked them bad, and I didn’t think I wanted to know the thing that would cause such a quick change of heart in a group of Apache so ready to kill just moments before. I watched the Apache guide Quillo and his horse away until they were out of sight, then I turned my head to the same rocky hillside that had scared off the Apache and saw the reason for their quick and strange departure. Sitting at the base of the hill was that same coyote that had been following my crew this whole time.

The yote rose to its feet and slowly made its way to me. As it moved closer, I could see in its eyes that this was not just some ordinary coyote. There was something old about this yote. Something very old. Maybe even ancient. I can’t quite find a good way to explain what I felt while looking into that yotes beady black eyes. It was like sitting under a very old tree. A tree that you know had been there long before you or anyone else. It’s not something you know because it looks particularly weathered, you can just *feel* its age.

The coyote sat at my feet and stared at me blankly. I felt studied, like a child might study a beetle before he crushes it under his boot.

“Just kill me,” I whispered, “just kill me and be done with it.” An onlooker might have thought I’d lost my mind talking to a yote like that, but I knew better. This was no coyote. This was some sort of spirit with a vendetta against me and my crew, and he had got us. One by one he got us all. Now he just had one life left to take and his reckoning would be complete.

Once again, I swear the coyote smiled, and he continued to sit there and study me. He seemed to be relishing my anticipation of what was to come.

Now here I sit with a broken leg, watching as the setting sun casts colors and shadows all around me. The coyote still hasn’t moved, and I am starting to wonder what might happen when night falls. Do spirits gain more power in the dark? Is he waiting until then so he can do something truly awful to me? I don’t know. Maybe he will just sit there and watch me starve to death.

Wars are rarely fought by those who declare them. History, when examined without slogans, reveals a consistent and uncomfortable truth: the greatest losses in wars are born not by leaders or decision-makers, but by ordinary civilians and low-ranking soldiers. The ruling class wages war with words and symbols; common people pay with blood, displacement, and broken futures.

Statistical evidence supports this reality. In modern conflicts, civilians account for **40–70% or more of total casualties**, a sharp shift from older wars where combatants formed the majority of the dead. The trend is unmistakable. As warfare has moved into cities and civilian spaces, ordinary people have become primary victims rather than collateral ones. World War II offers a grim benchmark: of approximately **60–75 million total deaths**, civilians made up **around 50–55 million**, more than twice the number of military deaths. This was not an exception—it was a warning of what modern, total war would become.

Contemporary conflicts repeat the pattern. In the Russia–Ukraine war, tens of thousands of soldiers have died, but **nearly 15,000 civilian deaths have been officially confirmed**, with many more unverified. Beyond deaths, the invisible costs are staggering. Globally, **over 123 million people are forcibly displaced due to conflict**, stripped of homes, education, stability, and dignity. Nearly **one in six children worldwide now lives in or near a conflict zone**, growing up amid fear rather than opportunity. These numbers do not represent strategy or victory; they represent human ruin.

Yet while soldiers die and civilians flee, political leaders meet, negotiate, and appear together on international stages. Publicly, they perform grief—momentary silences, speeches, and symbolic gestures. Privately, they engage in diplomacy over coffee, protected by distance, power, and privilege. Their lives continue uninterrupted. This contrast is not accidental; it is structural.

To sustain this system, societies must be divided. Religion, nationalism, ethnicity, and ideology are repeatedly weaponized to fracture populations that would otherwise recognize their shared suffering. The **Hindu–Muslim divide** in India is a painful example. Communities that once fought together during the independence movement now often clash without a clear understanding of why. The original causes have faded, but the hostility persists—kept alive because division serves political interests. 

**A united population asks dangerous questions. A divided one fights itself.**

This mechanism operates globally. **Governments do not fear external enemies as much as they fear internal unity**. Division is not a failure of governance; it is frequently a tool of governance. **Wars, then, are not merely clashes between nations—they are systems that convert human lives into manageable losses in exchange for preserved power**.

The conclusion is difficult but unavoidable. *Ordinary people are not enemies of one another; they are hostages of narratives designed to keep them apart.* Wars are not fought to protect civilians; civilians are sacrificed to protect authority. As long as this structure remains unchallenged, history will continue to repeat itself—leaders will speak, soldiers will die, civilians will suffer, and statistics will quietly record the cost.
