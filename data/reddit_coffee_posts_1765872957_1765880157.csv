A friend did the middle-of-the-night scramble for a bondsman, he called Mr. Nice Guy Bail Bonds, signed the papers, and I was home before sunrise with a stack of forms and a head full of questions.

Now I’m running on coffee, juggling work calls, and figuring out life without a sure-thing license. I’m pricing transit passes, lining up rides, and debating when to break the news at work. The hardest part is seeing how one bad decision ripples into every routine, no quick errands, no spontaneous plans, just extra scheduling and a lot of apologies.

My right calf's been hurting as usual. Idk why. I don't even care tbh but for some reason napaka comforting nung pain. I feel alive whenever it hurts.

Idk what to do. Bland food, coffee tastes like water.

Hindi ko alam kung tama ba 'tong pinasok kong decision or baka dahil sa hindi lang talaga ako sanay sa boring and walang control/direction.

This year is wild. Ginusto ko naman 'to pero I feel numb right now. The emotional exhaustion is too real. I fought for what I thought was real, pero it made me feel stupid. Minsan iniisip ko sana hindi ko nalang ginawa, pero alam kong hindi ko rin makukuha yung closure ko pag hindi. Pero ansakit pa rin.

Why does fate give you the wildest things in life that'll make you feel alive and that can make you second-guess everything tapos babawiin din agad?

I'm so tired. 2025 has been emotionally exhausting for me and sana 2026 would be nicer. I'm so done with people and I've never been this scared again to widen my circle. People can be really mean and cold.

Nakakapagod and iba ang trauma pag nasa 30s ka na. Lahat ng masakit and nakasakit, gusto ko na iwan sa 2025. I gave people chances to make things right but I guess if they want to, they'd actually would. But hindi naman nila ginawa. Kung babawi 'man sila, sana sa sarili na lang nila.

Translated and reposted to IsoldeMainsZZZ Subreddit & Discord by me with the original author's permission.**

  
**(This story picks up right where the previous part left off. Please read ""The Ivory Rose"" first.)**



As I took that blood-stained white rose from the hands of \[Magus\], I suddenly recalled the words I had spoken to Isolde countless days and nights ago—



""I hope that when we reach the end of the road, neither of us will hold any regrets.""



Looking at the flower in my hand, I suppose she achieved that. The path of revenge was rugged and uneven; she had walked too far upon it and lost too much. To her, even if the world promised by The Creator required a foundation of blood and death, it could not possibly be more disappointing than this world, which was already rotten to the core.



She gifted me this rose to tell me her final choice—



She felt sorrow for it, but she did not regret it.



......



Whether in New Eridu or within The Oracle squad of the Defense Force, I was always known as the smart one.



A smart man knows how to weigh the pros and cons, how to assess the situation, and how to clearly understand his position.



Take me, for instance. The so-called \[Myriad Shades\] was nothing more than a sharp knife in the hands of important men.



And a knife does not need thoughts of its own. The only thing that prevents it from being discarded is that it remains sharp enough, useful enough, and ""obedient"" enough.



I did this well.



I settled too many dirty jobs that could not be exposed for them; I resolved too many ""threatening"" individuals. The Oracle itself did not possess the authority of disposal, so in every operation, I ensured that no witness lived long enough to face judgment.



I never took sides in factional struggles, never asked about the details of missions, and never defied orders from above.



The only time I played the fool was perhaps that time I fought side-by-side with the Agamemnon Squad.



It wasn't a sudden discovery of conscience, nor was it love at first sight. It was simply that, at that moment, I felt that if this rotting world intended to bury such a squad and such people, I would rather die there with them.



That was the only foolish thing I did in my life.



The story that followed need not be retold. I continued to play the role of one of New Eridu’s few smart men. Smart men are experts at self-preservation. I extricated myself from the vortex of the Defense Force, escaped the manipulation of the upper echelons, and relying on years of gathered intelligence and the ability to play both sides, I completely shed my past with Isolde's help.



Yet, in the end, I had nothing.



That is the way of the smart man: always choosing the option most beneficial in the moment, always protecting oneself in times of crisis, always knowing what should be done and what should not—and consequently, always accomplishing nothing.



My fingers brushed lightly over the dried blood on the white rose. I thought to myself, \*I am the one who says one thing and feels another; I am the thorough, absolute fool.\*



Just like now. She has only just left, and I am already regretting it.



......



My sleep schedule is very regular. This was the first time I lost track of time in a dream. Waking up felt as though a lifetime had passed, my head splitting with pain.



I glanced at my watch; it was just striking nine in the morning, which hardly matched the sensation of a long, drawn-out nightmare.



It was only when I tried to wash and dress that I realized I couldn't find the rose I had so carefully placed on the desk. frantically turning the nearby area upside down, I still couldn't find where it had gone. Instead, I found quite a few trinkets I had thrown into the trash long ago.



Among them was a calendar that should have been yellowed with age, sitting brand new in the drawer. The date on it remained eight years in the past.



......



The Café.



I found Isolde in the corner. She looked exactly as I remembered her. The emotions in those blue eyes were still visible, not yet as heavy and inscrutable as they would become eight years later.



She sat there quietly, holding a cup of the bitterest black coffee—this was not her preference, but ever since the Fall of the Old Capital, it was the only thing I had seen her drink.



""What brings you to invite me to a café at this hour? Celebrating your hard-earned retirement life?""



Seeing me, she smiled and greeted me, her voice gentle but laced with teasing—she was like this every time we met, tender and wonderful.



We both knew of each other's disguises, yet we tacitly enjoyed this superficial intimacy, as if it were a rare relaxation for two people who lived double lives.



I sat opposite her. Even though I had heard her voice on the phone this morning, the heart in my chest was still pounding. This shouldn't be happening; I had undergone the most professional training, and even the harshest environments should not alter my heart rate.



It was just that, seeing her so alive, that training instantly failed.



""Then this time, it must be my treat. To thank the Commander for her guidance and help over the years, including your efforts to ensure my successful retirement.""



I feigned the appearance of eight years ago. That memory, once like a dream, was now incredibly clear, reminding me that today was the first day of my successful discharge.



I ordered a latte from the professional barista, then sat quietly across from her, studying her face.



She was beautiful; her exquisite features held the glamour of a woman and the sharpness of a soldier. The mole at the corner of her eye diluted the sternness of her aura, adding a touch of faint softness.



She obviously noticed my gaze but made no reaction to it. After taking a light sip of the black coffee, she spoke softly:



""After retirement, what do you plan to do?""



""The bonus from the missions is enough to keep me fed and clothed for the rest of my life... I think I'll probably open a flower shop, one that specializes in roses. When there are customers, I'll sell flowers; when there aren't, I'll lie in a rocking chair and read books.""



The first half of the sentence was the same as what I said to her in my previous life, but the second half seemed to be the inner voice that had inexplicably slipped out.



Sure enough, she showed a look of surprise. First, she glanced at me, then the corners of her mouth curled up slightly:



""Growing flowers is not an easy craft. I find it hard to imagine you tending to plants under the sunlight, leisurely reading a book.""



""Everything can be learned. I actually think I'm quite good at learning.""



I drained the latte in my cup, and changed the subject seamlessly:



""For example, recently, I learned a unique skill from an old man in Waifei Peninsula. Just by reading palms, I can see a person's future.""



As I spoke, I deliberately looked at her, my tone teasing:



""Want to try? Men left, women right. No charge if it's inaccurate.""



""Oh?""



Seeing my eager gaze, she readily took off the glove on her right hand and extended it before me:



""Then, please, future flower shop owner, give it a try. Can you see our future?""



I pretentiously took her hand, looking it over back and forth, my fingertips gently brushing across the back of her hand.



No mark. No red glow. No trace left by The Exaltists.



It is not too late.



""The Commander's palm points to a very beautiful future.""



I heard my own voice, hoarse, struggling to suppress the prophecy of sobbing joy:



""You will have your heart's desire; you will be happy and fulfilled.""



......



There is an ancient fable in Waifei Peninsula about a sage who dreamed he was a butterfly. Upon waking, he felt an illusion, unsure if he had dreamed of the butterfly, or if the butterfly was dreaming of him.



For the current me, it is the same.



I do not know if Heaven felt my life was too shameful and tragic and gave me a chance to start over, or if I simply had a dream—a long, sad nightmare.



But regardless, I have obtained a second chance. And this time, I know clearly what I have to do, and what I want to do.



And those memories—whether from a dream or a past life—gave me immense help.



......



Getting evidence of Porcelumex's participation in human experimentation wasn't difficult; the hard part was knowing \*that\* they were conducting human experimentation in the first place. Relying on my clairvoyance of the future, I skipped that hardest step.



The subsequent infiltration, securing the evidence, and incidentally saving the head of the powerful Thymefield family and a lovely little lady who was being used as a test subject... these were all trivial matters that could be glossed over.



With witnesses and material evidence complete, it was enough to easily send Ferox, one of the tycoons of Porcelumex, to the guillotine.



And that is exactly what happened.



Obtaining this intelligence, Lucro, seeing hope to completely crush his greatest rival, was like a hyena smelling blood, pouncing on his opponent and tearing madly. He won over the fence-sitters, suppressed subordinates loyal to Ferox, and disguised himself as a conscientious entrepreneur who cared for the people, giving speeches to buy public hearts. This was basically identical to the development of the previous life, only this time it came more suddenly and more violently.



Privately, Lucro found me. He was ecstatic, promising me high office and rich rewards to thank me for my ""help"" in his rapid ascent. I readily agreed to this, feigning loyalty to his banner. While flattering him, I obtained his future plans.



Therefore, he would never have imagined that at his speech conference—where security was tight and the design flawless, where he promised to investigate corruption within Porcelumex and ban all illegal research—someone was standing in the VIP room he had specially arranged, observing him through a sniper rifle.



Lucro had been vigilant all his life; he shouldn't have lost his guard against me. It was just a pity that in this world, he believed that \[Myriad Shades\], bought by wealth, had no reason to murder him.



""I promise—""



He was using that disgusting, glib tone to announce the measures he was about to take to the people below. Unfortunately, before he could spit those lies out of his mouth, his head exploded into a beautiful blossom of blood mist.



Red mixed with white slurry splattered onto the iron door behind him that hadn't yet closed, looking like a bewitching window decal.



......



Everyone knew that Porcelumex was finished.



First, a scandalous revelation about one tycoon, then the public assassination of the other person most likely to take power. The entire management team was already in chaos due to the sudden accidents. And as luck would have it, Lucro was in the middle of purging dissidents.



Now, the work of purging dissidents wasn't finished, but he had lost his own head first. The entire board of directors came to a complete standstill, the employees below were furious, and how could the other members of TOPS let go of such a defenseless piece of fat meat?



During this period, Isolde called me countless times, but I did not answer. Because I was waiting. I was waiting for the most critical guy to show his cloven hoof; I was waiting for him to ask me for help.



That night, I received a call from Lorenz.



This fellow, who had become a commander in the Defense Force, was probably the most panicked person right now. Porcelumex being leaderless meant his dirty dealings could be exposed at any time. Under these circumstances, he needed someone obedient and capable of doing dirty work to bury these matters in the shadows forever.



And that person could only be me.



......



Entering the territory of the Defense Force high command naturally meant no weapons allowed. I was searched three times, inside and out, before finally walking into Lorenz's office carrying the ""data"" obtained from Porcelumex.



There was no one else inside but him. Clearly, he didn't trust anyone else to handle this content.



Not even me, his most ""trusted"" subordinate.



As soon as I handed over this material, the next step would inevitably be the classic disposal of the hound once the hare is killed. Since I had already retired, he only needed a random excuse to put me to death.



But he couldn't turn hostile before seeing the materials with his own eyes, because he wouldn't feel safe letting anyone else handle something so lethal.



So he had to meet me in person.



I pulled out the chair opposite him and sat down, slamming the documents onto his desk:



""These are the originals of all the data in Porcelumex's hands that are unfavorable to you. As for the copies, I imagine a man of your stature has the ability to prove they are all 'forgeries'.""



A look of joy appeared on his face, though he tried to act composed:



""Well done, \[Myriad Shades\]. What reward do you want this time?""



Big shots are like this. Even if they've made up their mind to get rid of you, they still have to posture beforehand.



I didn't answer him. I just looked over his desk.



The desk was spotless. Not only was there no dust, but there weren't even many documents that needed processing. A single pencil sat lonely in the pen holder, and his seal was tossed carelessly in the corner of the table.



It seemed this nominal Defense Force commander cared more about the toasting and drinking during exchanges of benefits than paperwork.



""I wonder if you like watching movies, sir?""



My abrupt question aroused his vigilance. He sat up a little straighter, frowning slightly:



""What do you mean?""



""Nothing much. I just suddenly remembered a movie I watched a long time ago called \*Godslayer\*. It tells the story of a hitman who chooses revenge after losing everything.""



I smiled at him, pulling that solitary pencil from the holder:



""There is a famous scene in it. A high-ranking figure tells the story of the hitman's legend—he killed three men in a bar... with a mere pencil.""



I saw his pupils instantly contract.



One of his hands went to press the button under the table, while the other tried to reach for the pistol at his waist. Unfortunately, he had lived in luxury for so many years; his speed was laughably slow.



I covered his mouth and drove the pencil through his throat:



""This story teaches us two lessons. First, do not provoke a man with nothing to lose.""



""Second...""



I pulled out the pencil and watched the light in his eyes fade bit by bit:



""In your next life, don't leave such dangerous things in your office.""



......



Everything after that went as I expected. The incident was exposed, and a city-wide warrant was issued. Only this time, it was an unprecedented thunderous wrath from the entirety of New Eridu. They were bound to find the true culprit behind the scenes, the hidden truth.



I was beaten into hiding like a stray dog; my usual escape methods were rendered ineffective in moments.



In the very end, I was forced into the depths of a Hollow by a joint elite squad of NEPS and the Defense Force.



At my final hiding spot, I met Isolde.



She knew my habits too well, and thus was one step faster than the elite squad. This actually gave us a chance—to see each other one last time before parting.



""This isn't \[Myriad Shades\]' style.""



That was the first thing she said when she saw me.



""You left too many, far too many flaws, as if deliberately letting people trace the vine to the melon. You planned all of this long ago... Vesper, answer me, why did you do this?""



This was the first time in two lifetimes that I heard her call me by my real name, Vesper.



I couldn't help but smile:



""Because only in this way could I help you complete your revenge.""



In the twilight glow, I saw her breathing falter for a second.



As she said, I had indeed planned everything.



The collapse of Porcelumex, the death of Lorenz, accompanied by everything exposed with their deaths. The accumulation of these events was by no means a simple 1+1=2; it was bound to cause an uproar that would shake New Eridu. Too many people were implicated, too many organizations involved, too many powers shaken.



The case had to be resolved; this was the will of the people.



But who would resolve it, and how, was a high-stakes gamble regarding political careers. Therefore, it was destined to become a hot potato. No one wanted to clean up the mess left by a dead predecessor.



Except for one person—Isolde.



She was a Colonel with a clean background, known to all as a ""flower vase"" uninvolved in any incidents. Before this, no one would have allowed her to hold real power, but amidst this event, she became the perfect person to take the helm.



Of course, it required a little more cooperation from me.



The reason I wasted time talking in Lorenz's office was that I knew the shift change schedule inside the Defense Force beforehand. When I killed Lorenz, I ensured that Isolde would be the first person to discover the scene.



And she would certainly not hide the detailed dossier I had left on the desk.



""Ahem...""



Mimicking her tone, I stood on the edge of the cliff, smiling at her:



""Alright, now the only villain is the despicable and cruel \[Myriad Shades\], while Commander Isolde will be the protagonist who gets her wish, happy and fulfilled.""



Dense footsteps came from behind her; the other members of the elite squad had arrived. According to the script planned long ago, I reached for the pistol at my waist.



And she would be one step faster than me.



Sparks flew. My head felt heavy, and my body fell backward uncontrollably. As I plummeted down the cliff, I had a moment of clarity—that didn't feel like being shot.



A small object danced in the air, flashing with light. As I fell rapidly, I caught it—



A single Denny.



......



Eight years later.



Isolde, who had killed the true culprit and satisfactorily handled that earth-shattering event, soon made public the filth within the Defense Force. Amidst the monstrous public opinion, she completed the cleansing of the Defense Force and became its unquestionable leader.



Krampus intervened and thoroughly investigated all assets under Porcelumex, causing it to collapse completely shortly thereafter. All the filth of the past had nowhere to hide. To appease public anger, most of the fallen Porcelumex's assets were used as reparations for the victims and the soldiers who had sacrificed themselves back then.



As for me, nominally, I was already dead.



Falling from a cliff in a Hollow... even if one survived the fall, it was impossible to find a way out. Who would believe that the mortal \[Myriad Shades\], having hired only a rookie Proxy, could coincidentally fall into a fissure with a one-in-ten-thousand probability, and be coincidentally transported to a place where he could leave the Hollow, surviving by sheer luck?



As for that rookie Proxy later becoming the legendary \[Phaethon\], that was something even less traceable.



At this moment, I was standing in a corner of Lumina Square, waiting for that person to rush to our first date.



I had no relevant experience, so naturally, I didn't know what preparations to make. In the end, thanks to the advice of an expert on the Inter-Knot, I hurriedly reserved a bouquet of roses from the Dew Gardening Shop.



However, when the blue-haired young girl appeared in front of me and handed me the large bouquet of reserved red roses, I couldn't help but widen my eyes:



""Since when... is this also part of your job?""



""Hehe, as the acting manager appointed by Miss Orchidea, I don't understand what you're implying, sir?""



The girl named Belle played dumb while secretly nudging me with her elbow, lowering her voice:



""A friendly tip: the person you're waiting for is just around that corner over there. Don't you want to give her a surprise?""



As she spoke, she gave me a hard shove.



Even though she didn't use much strength, I still stumbled. Walking with flustered steps to the corner, I ran right into Isolde, who had just turned the bend.



Our eyes met. For the first time, I felt an overwhelming wave of awkwardness.



But she quickly rescued me from it.



Smiling, she took the flowers from my hand, pulled out a single stem, and pinned it to her chest—in the place where a white rose once hung, and which was now empty.



""Aren't you going to say something?""



I opened my mouth, but in the end, I couldn't say a word. I simply reached out and embraced her with all my strength.

     The Babalawo gave us chamomile cigarettes to smoke while some ladies took off our shirts and cleaned us with tree branches. The man killed a chicken and offered us a glass of blood to drink. Afterwards, we drank the broth from the bones and took shots of whiskey.
     
    I don’t remember sleeping that night. But I found myself walking early, early in the morning with a little cup of coffee. Benito English yelled at me to get on a forklift. ""Forget that box-throwing shit, you made it to the major leagues."" He told me with a big smile. I spent the morning drinking my coffee, smoking Cubans, mounted on my machine, organizing what those sons of bitches on the floor were moving.

     By noon, things changed. We went into the cafeteria. Rocco already had the television tuned to the news channel:
You could see the gringo's funeral. Everyone was dressed in black. This was the first time I saw my father, the Vice President, standing next to the mero mero (the big boss), the ""owner of the island""... the President of Harmony. But the blonde woman standing next to the boss had a bigger effect. A beauty who had two little daughters with her. The black clothes suited her pale skin... and made her hair shine over the dark clouds. The owner's daughter, the widow of the worm I painted the floor with. No one spoke, because it was better to listen, as we still awaited the punishment.

     When we returned to the floor, we saw dead bodies, several bodies. Most of the employees had collapsed blue, with green clouds hovering over them. ""There's your damn pestilence, you crazy fuck. Get your masks on!"" ordered Alberto Bistec, and we put on gas masks to return to work, which tripled for us now...
I don't know how many days passed like this, but we Magos sweat like sons of bitches. Gods punished by titans whom we could only see on a small screen. But all my misery... it somehow disappeared because I was infected with the beauty of a succubus.

     After new morons started showing up and they put another soft meat in the gringo's position, things returned to a softer routine. I was on the roof of the warehouse, sitting in a cherry picker with a joint and a Colt .45, enjoying the sunset. I have a problem: when I see something, or when I feel something good, something I like... I want to die right away so I don't have to endure it anymore.

     Suddenly, Alberto Bistec showed up there, ""Hey loco, if you're not too busy, I have a little job for you... if you want it. If not, I'll give it to Chile."" 
""Tell me, tiger, what's up?"" I answered.
""You have to clean something inside the city. You go, see what it is, and if you need help, come back and look for me.""
""To clean, man? Like mopping and shit?"" I asked him. ""I don't have a clue, papo."" Alberto told me, hands up.
""Okay then, does Chile take me?"" I asked. 
""Ah ha, find a phone somewhere when you finish so they can pick you up.""

     ""Chile, tell me what I have to clean, man? I need some information before a contract, you know that."" We were in the jeep and I was nervous because you know how things are. Even your friends can disembowel you without blinking an eye. ""Look, man, they pay me to drive, to be a chauffeur and mechanic. Did I put on the wrong fucking hat? Am I wearing a turban or what? Do you think I'm a fortune teller???"" He took a swig from his flask. ""Get to cleaning what you see is  dirty and call me when you finish, it's that easy, loco.""

     We arrived at a giant mansion. For talking so much of gods, I found myself standing in front of the ""Pearly Gates."" ""Charon"" drove off. There was an army of security who let me pass. ""What do I need to do?"" I asked...
""The boss will be here shortly, wait in the Foyer."" In the foyer... ¿El lugar para follar? Hahaha.... Even though I was waiting for the boss, I had no stress. I had... excitement. Once I took a couple of laps around the folladero. Was I expecting a promotion, or was it my turn to be sent to the creator.

     A seraphim entered with her cherubim. I couldn't hear, and I lost strength in my legs. The lady did her dance through her kingdom while a nanny took the little angels away. Finally, when she made eye contact with me, the woman answered my question from before... if I was god or demon.
""You speak English, correct?""
""Correct."" I answered.
""Here take this."" She gave me a pager. ""We are leaving Friday and I need this place cleared up. I heard you throw boxes, yeah?"" I laughed a little. ""Yes, I throw a lot of boxes.""
""Ok, so I'll page you if I need something specific moved. For now start in the foyer."" She left quickly and left me standing there like my cock, mouth open and holding a pager.

     The amount of things these elites had in their possession gave me disgust and anxiety. But in terms of work, this was nothing for me... a couple of hours, so I started bullshitting because I wanted with all my soul for that fucking pager to sound. It was already night and I had spent too much time without a smoke or drink... and I was thirsty and desperate. I was about to leave into that city to call Chile. It was when the butler was shutting the door that the pager sounded.

     I had tachycardia when I entered the lady's room. There, on her big bed. Very comfortable. In shorts... almost non-existent. With her blonde hair tied up, she was very focused... on painting the nails of her little feet. Pink. The entire room was pink, with gold accents. ""Wa wa wa wa-wa..."" she uttered...
""I'm sorry..."" I said, I swear I didn't hear anything...
""I'm sick of looking at that chest over there..."" she pointed with her polish brush without looking at me. ""It belonged to Looey and I want it out of here."" 
""Okay."" And I immediately moved to lift the chest. I was almost free of that trap... ""Gardin..."" I froze, all the blood in my body froze. ""It's Gardin, right?"" she asked me. 
""Yea, how you know that?"" I questioned...

     ""That night he hired you, he was so worked up about you being related to the VP. 'Gardin Flowers this, and Gardin Flowers that.' I told him to give it a rest, so that's when he went to that bar and got himself shot."" A long pause... she began to admire her thick legs, she extended them as if to check her nails. She was a full-figured woman, like some mothers are. Irresistible. ""You coming back tomorrow, right Mr. Flowers?""
I panicked, ""Yes, ma'am, just... beep me?"" 
""Okay"" she told me. I went out the door. ""It's Flores... by the way. Gardin Flores. I don't use that VP's English version, i dont know the guy."" She smiled for the first time that night. Her eyes disappeared and she showed me her white teeth. ""Cool. I'll remember that."" She told me, and I flew away as if I had just stolen something... I even forgot the big box on my shoulder. The guard took it from me, and I flew far away from there.

     I walked into the city and didn't call Chile at all... I found a bottle... a bag of weed and tobacco... and even an ounce of coke. Tonight, I was going to die because there's no better high I'm going to feel in this life than how I felt tonight with that woman. I didn't even touch her and I'm in love. I spoke it... I manifested it, and I don't want to know more. After feeling dead for 30 years... all candles eventually have burn out some time.

     However, I did wake up that morning. I was face down in a pile of shit... and vomit. Everything hurt. I had nothing, not even my brass knuckles, or my revolver. No jacket, just a t-shirt and my shorts. I didn't even have shoes! But I had that fucking beeper clutched in my hand. I walked a few blocks until I found a phone. ""Hey Chile, what's up...""

     Wa wa wa wa... ""Aha, yes, yes, yes, of course.""
Wa wa wa wa... ""Hey man, I have a migraine from the devil, would you be kind enough to shut your fat mouth and do that fucking chauffeur job you were talking about the other night???""
He hung up on me.

     I continued walking for a while... trembling because I needed something to smoke... and drink. And a couple of those damn pills that the Harmony guys give us for whatever you come up with. Everyone in the city looked at me, I looked worse than that day I left prison. Is this my rebirth? 
""Ma'am... do I look like someone who is saved?"" I asked a girl selling fruit... she got scared and called her father who suddenly appeared with a shotgun. ""You want to be saved, cabrón?""

     ""WHOAH! Take it easy, dude, he's a fucking loco! A dog with fleas, man! Hahaha!!!"" Alberto Bistec came along to save me... ""I swear, man, he doesn't even know where he's standing!"" He bought us some mangoes, and we walked to the warehouse.

     We entered through the south of the warehouse where Mala Gente is in charge. ""Speak Albertooo!"" ""Mala Gente! Is there a casualty around?"" ""For what?"" ""The loco lost his boots and jacket... like a donkey."" The two burst out laughing.
Meanwhile, I saw a man, just my size, whose black outfit I liked. He was stamping boxes for Mala Gente. I grabbed a stamper as if I were going to work. ""What are you doing, burro, your boots are here!"" Mala Gente yelled, showing me some clown shoes. I walked up to the boxes and the guy dressed in black. ""What do you want, man?"" I broke his skull with the stamper. The man kneeled down. ""Don't get my clothes dirty, worm,"" I told him. I turned off his lights and put on my new outfit. Sometimes these folks forget how serious i am. ""What is your problem, psicópata?"" Yelled Mala Gente. The man had good cigarettes in his pocket, so I lit one. 
I made sure I had that holy beeper, and exhaled.

     ""Put one of your bums to clean that shit up there."" I went to the cafeteria to have a coffee. ""Rocco..."" i called out to the old man who said, ""HUH"", so i asked ""do you have a pill for pain... I can't even see..."" and the old man said ""Okay, chico, I have it hidden in my ass, one minute,  Hahahaaha!""
The old man burst out laughing. ""Take it, man."" Benito English gave me a pill. ""I don't have a leg, manin, did you know that?"" He showed me his peg leg. ""Thanks."" I said and took the pill.
Chile Boligrafo enteded, ""Hey, Johnny Cash, come help me with this fucked-up transmission."" We left and walked towards his wing of the warehouse. He told me ""Next time you need a ride, it's a better idea not to disrespect me, understand?"" I was looking at the transmission... and he hit me on the head with a pipe wrench. I tried to take out my weapon, but I didn't have it... ""don't forget your rank, I'm still leagues above you. So either fix that fucking transmission or I'll give you a remodeling."" Chile left to do something else.


     We all ended up at La Condena that night.
 We consumed several pitchers of beer and ate spaghetti with salami and octopus. Alberto slurred, half-drunk, 
""The warehouse belongs to us. We are the owners. I am the President... Chile, you are the VP, brother."" Chile Bolígrafo said ""salut"" with his glass. ""Who am I, Alberto?"" asked Rocco Rocoto. ""That Don Trompa from TV, who hangs out with young girls!"" They burst into laughter while I kept one ear on the beeper. Wa-wa-wa? ""Loco!"" They startled me. ""A meeting, you and dad."" Alberto told me. ""Why would I do something like that... I have better luck winning a Colt .45, than getting a meeting with that king."" I answered.
Mala Gente was slouched in his chair looking at me,
""Tell me how, loco... A man as educated as your father could generate a PIECE OF TRASH like you, tolete!"" Hahaha. I sat up straight. ""Your father has majestic children, descendants with prospects. He doesn't have time, not even in 100 lifetimes, to waste it talking with a PERRO like this."" I threw myself onto Mala Gente, and we wrestled right there on the bar floor. We were separated. ""He's drunk, Matatán, he doesn't know what he's saying!"" said Benito. BEEP-BEEP
That holy beeper sounded off.  I look at chile still sitting at the tabke. ""Hey, with all due respect, can I ask you to take me to the same location as the other night."" We moved to a corner with coke. *SNIF* This guy Chile really liked coke. ""Aahh... what do you have in that mansion, loco? A little job is one thing, but recurrent service is subject to taxes."" 
He wiped his big nose and licked his fingers.

     ""Look, tiger... I've never focused on cardio in my life. I'm developing a gut, and that's not respectable. Forget that ride, primo, I'd rather walk."" I quickly left there. ""75 percent of the sacrifices go to the gods, son!"" Chile yelled at me in the distance.

     The widow came to the door dressed like a vampire.
""I am leaving tomorrow at 7 a.m., Gardin Flores. 
Today I need you to load the truck; you'll ride with it and unload it once the driver arrives at the boat I'm taking. I will be home tonight by 7 p.m."" 
""There's only 6 suitcases, ma'am..."" I hollered to her as she walked out the door, and the woman froze. She turned around and lowered her sunglasses. ""Is that some kind of problem, Gardin?"" I looked left and right like a moron...
""No, ma'am, it's just, that's not going to take me the whole day, why do you need me to be here till night?""
That beauty started laughing...
""I'm sure I'm going to need something moved around later this evening. You can get comfortable and help yourself to a drink in the wet bar over there."" She pointed with her little finger to a room that looked like a kitchen, but only for drinks...
""Unless you'd rather go labour at the Harmony Cold Storage."" She adjusted her sunglasses and gave me a sarcastic smile. ""No, I think I'll have a Cuba Libre."" She turned around and headed for a luxury car.

     ""Ma'am?"" She got into the back seat of the car and rolled down her tinted window. ""Can I know your name?"" I asked her... ""Minerva. Minerva Dumont."" She rolled up her window and left.",1,1765879186.0,noir,0,0.67,False

Just did a brilliant self-guided day in Liverpool and it’s honestly one of those cities that keeps switching personalities on you in the best way. You start with grand, “look at this architecture” energy, hit the cathedrals, wander through the livelier streets, then finish at the waterfront with docks + Beatles stuff + a well-earned sit down 🍻

Full write-up + route is here (with a free map): [https://thetraveltinker.com/walking-tour/liverpool-walking-tour/](https://thetraveltinker.com/walking-tour/liverpool-walking-tour/)

# 🗺️ Route (in order)

**Lime Street → St George’s Quarter → Metropolitan Cathedral → Hope Street → Liverpool Cathedral → Ropewalks/Bold Street → Cavern Quarter → Pier Head → Royal Albert Dock**

**Distance:** \~7.5 km / 4.7 miles  
**Time:** 4–6 hours (longer if you do museums + snack a lot like I did 😅)  
**Difficulty:** Easy, with a gentle uphill to the cathedrals

# 🚶 Stop-by-stop highlights

# 1) Lime Street + St George’s Quarter 🏛️

Big “welcome to Liverpool” vibes. St George’s Hall area is made for dramatic photos.

**Tiny tip:** Start earlier if you want less bus/traffic chaos in your shots 📸

# 2) Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral ⛪️🌈

Modern, bright, and very “this is not your usual cathedral”. Worth popping inside even if you’re not usually into churchy stuff.

**Good to know:** If a service is on, it’s still visitable but keep it low-key.

# 3) Hope Street 🍷🎭

Connects the two cathedrals and is a really nice stretch for a wander. Good café/pub zone too.

**Pro tip:** Do Hope Street before lunchtime for cleaner photos and fewer crowds.

# 4) Liverpool Cathedral 🖤⛪️

The big gothic beast. Absolutely massive. If you’re into views, the tower option is tempting (but your legs will have opinions).

**Fact:** If you’re doing any tower climb today, this is the one… but save energy for the docks later 😅

# 5) Ropewalks + Bold Street 🍔☕️

This is the “refuel and browse” zone. Loads of food options and a more indie buzz.

**Good to know:** It’s the easiest place on the route to find lunch, toilets, and a proper sit-down.

# 6) Cavern Quarter + Mathew Street 🎶🧱

Beatles central. Busy, loud, touristy… still fun. Murals, music, people-watching.

**Pro tip:** If you hate crowds, hit this earlier, then do lunch after.

# 7) Pier Head + Beatles Statue 🌊📸

The classic Liverpool skyline moment. River air, big buildings, and a great place to slow down.

**Good to know:** It gets windy. Like, hair-choices-get-made-for-you windy 🌬️

# 8) Royal Albert Dock + Museums ⚓️

Perfect finish. You’ve got dock views, food/drinks, **The Beatles Story**, and the **Merseyside Maritime Museum** right there too.

**Good to know:** Ending here is ideal because you can museum-hop without worrying about “the walk still isn’t over” energy.

# ☕️ Food & drink notes (rough costs)

* Coffee: **£3–£5** (≈ €4–€6 / $4–$6)
* Lunch: **£10–£18** (≈ €12–€21 / $13–$23)
* Dockside drinks: **£6–£12** (≈ €7–€14 / $8–$15)

# 📸 Best photo spots

* Inside the Metropolitan Cathedral (colourful light)
* Hope Street framing towards either cathedral
* Liverpool Cathedral exterior (step back for scale)
* Pier Head skyline + river
* Albert Dock reflections near golden hour ✨

# Quick Q&A ⚡️

**Best start time?** 9:30–10:30am.  
**Can you shorten it?** Yep, you can skip Pier Head and go straight from Cavern Quarter to Albert Dock.  
**Bad weather friendly?** Surprisingly yes. Cathedrals + museums = indoor saves ☔️

Overall, it was not very bad, I could eat everything I wanted and led pretty normal life.

After eradicating h pylori, I feel like everything went downhill. Repeated gastroscopy and biopsy confirmed that I got rid both of gastritis and h pylori, however, I started having issues with acid reflux once h pylori was gone.   I barely had any acid reflux before. Now I get unpleasant heartburn pretty often, recently I drank some coffee and now my throat is irritated and voice a bit hoarse. I've never had issues like this with h pylori and they made my quality of life now much worse than with gastritis.

I will go to ENT doctor for check if my throat is really irritated from acid. If he confirms it, I will go again to Gastroenterologist to discuss much more in detail why h pylori eradication made me feel much worse and what to do with acid reflux. I would even consider surgery if that's needed. Just overall I feel frustrated that I followed doctor's recommendations to eradicate h pylori as it seems like it damaged my health.

Employees were also not provided with SSS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth benefits, which are basic and required protections for workers.

On top of this, one employee was made to do the work meant for five people — handling delivery, barista duties, driving, purchasing, and other tasks — without proper compensation or support.

Employees deserve: • 13th month pay
• Government-mandated benefits
• Fair workload and humane working conditions

This post is not to spread hate, but to stand up for workers’ rights and to call on employers to follow DOLE and Philippine labor laws. Workers should be treated with dignity and fairness.

M

Normal weight

IRON, B12, VITAMIN D, CANNABIS???

Ok so basically I had this weird set of dreams a few nights ago where I started waking up convinced I just had severe GI distress throughout the night. My stomach kept dropping and I felt like I was getting violently ill with really bad and painful indigestion, possibly some diarrhea and like I'm about to vomit multiple times already. Then I woke up and had no symptoms whatsoever. Nothing. I felt perfeclty fine. Actually pretty good. And still felt fine for the past 3 days aside from some explosive watery diarrhea earlier today that really felt.like nothing and coincidence I was just having dinner and like starving hungry. I have a really strong appetite [eat everything all the time] and IBS symptoms are usually minimal if not non-existent [I've had it before ]. Like the whole thing was imaginary.

The weird thing is I felt like this happened one time before a long time ago and this was some kind of repressed memory of something that happened while I was asleep. And in the dream it was the afternoon at my old house and I was getting violently ill for some reason and felt guilty because I was afraid I smoked weed and that caused this. I was afraid my mom would be mad at me, I wouldn't be able to smoke weed anymore [addict brain says later that day or the next], basically just felt that this was the worst afternoon of my life... and by the way my Granddad was on the way because we're going somewhere and I was just feeling scared, devastated and in a lot of pain, hoping I would feel better and everything would be fine by the time he got there.  Even though this was just a dream and nothing like this ever happened before. Another dream started automatically where I was playing a game like Alice and had to roll over a certain spot on the ground every 10 seconds or everything disappears and then I woke up because I was asleep for 8 hours already.

Anyway, Because I'm reading a lot about Cannabais Hyperemesis Sudorme really afraid of getting it despite 10+ years with no incident [I was a heavy user with no problems]. I've had brutal hangovers where I was vomiting for hours before and they still didn't feel like this dream. One time I had diarrhea numerous times at night after an evening of drinking and kinda enjoyed it. Like I said it felt like a repressed memory of alcohol poisoning or the first time having CHS or something even more terrible. I just couldn't shake the feeling it was real because the sensations while I was asleep were so bizarre and violent. Like my head was exploding and my stomach already exploded multiple times and the pain was beyond anything I've felt before. All accompanied by this peculiar feeling like I was being starved of oxygen because I had carbon monoxide poisoning or something.

Of course I've had weird sensations while asleep or falling asleep. A couple times I woke up feeling like my guts were just squeezed by a snake/blocked for a second. One time I felt a board break over my head. Another time I felt my stomach drop before falling asleep. Sometimes I feel a terrible shock like my heart just stopped. Even a lot of little shocks somewhere in my guts making my heart flutter [again, I felt like this happened one time before]. I'm terrified of these feelings and need them to stop! I dwell on them literally all the time. I think they're related because they only started after I started vaping really heavily [just 3mg and then 6 and now 3 - I know I'm an idiot because hitting a 20mg makes me feel like I'm gonna pass out and now I get lightheaded all the time]] [without enough air intake a couple times apparently I hit my stomach with the vape] in the past year and tried an antipsychotic and believe that and the nicotine is causing these ""brain zaps"" which I know are not normal because they really are shocking and terrifying and disorienting and feels like I'm dying from a severe illness when they happen without warning.

And then the only real other explanation I have maybe is that the iron pills I'm on hurting my stomach even though I kinda avoided them lately because of that reason I did have them and the extra magnesium citrate I had 300mg that day... I still take the iron but after this incident I won't likely take magnesium citrate ever again likely. I also had a shot of gin [Bombay Sapphire] one of the drinks that made me violently sick before. I really hardly drink anymore and don't remember even having any weed that day. I had small amounts of weed oil in the past week that did make me feel kinda sick but like I always tell myself now I'm really slowing down on drinking coffee and relying on my ""healthy"" foods I always like fruit like apples and bananas and honey and oatmeal and orange juice I run for in emergencies because my doctor basically accused me and said I need the iron from steak likely 3 times a week. I had already given up steak and planned on maybe being vegetarian except I also believe red meat is healthy. And shockingly my ferritin went down like 15 points despite taking the iron religiously at the beginning of summer. I also have low b12 and reccommended a lot of vitamin d supplements throughout winter. Originally I stopped taking the iron because I felt like I was overdosing and the pills were hurting my stomach and everything hurts from sleeping and still hurts sometimes [I suspect an ulcer]. So I decided I would start having real food basically and maybe all that sugar isn't really healthy... I used to smoke weed all the time and I was really healthy... Before all these disturbing side effects

I'm just not sure if anyone can ever explain this because I feel like there's no explanation that will ever reassure me and for the past 3 days I'm obsessing because I feel perfectly fine and have good dreams and no problems while I'm awake besides a little stomach ache today. Can anyone say they've ever really heard of this happening before? Does it have a natural explanation. I'm not sure because I feel like this is a mix of psychosomatic and real symptoms and I just feel so guilty and afraid, I'm losing a major part of myself, the intensity of being Bipolar and a hypochondriac and anxiety-ridden person with depression confused ALL THE TIME I just want to be healthy and really that's the ONLY thing I'm trying to accomplish and every time I feel something INSANE like this like a couple times I ate butter chicken and had nightmares for 3 hours reliably I feel like, idk, what am I gonna do after this?

​Here’s a peek behind the scenes: For every 350g of Lipa Signature Barako GCB we roast, we end up with about 305g of roasted beans. But we don't stop there. We hand-sort again, removing another 40-50g of defects—quakers, cracked beans, or scorching. That’s a 13–16% loss that we happily take on.

>​Why do we do it? 🤔

**Because we champion Community Coffee.** These are the beans often overlooked by big traders or ""specialty-only"" buyers because they require extra work. They often sit unsold in farmers' sacks.

​But at Malarayat, we know *these beans have soul.* They are the product of our local farmers' hard work, and with that extra layer of sorting (which we cover!), they taste amazing.

​By buying these beans, we help farmers clear their stock and raise funds for better equipment and training. It’s a cycle of growth: we support them now, so they can produce harvest-winning quality later. 🌱

1pnxxmr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pnxxmr,My Lexus Journey in Japan :),"I was lucky enough to visit Japan for a full week recently. I made it a mission to visit both Lexus restaurants, and the Lexus International Gallery Aoyama. Unfortunately, the gallery is closed for renovations until next year, so I supplemented that by visiting a Lexus dealership in Yokohama where I was staying, and both of the restaurants are located in Tokyo. My whole mission was to score a bottle of Morizo Tea (Success!) and to see the Lexus LFA (Mission failed due to the gallery renovation, but that gives me a reason to return!)

1. Lexus MEETS HIBIYA
This was a beautiful cafe located inside a mall, the food is fantastic and staff were extremely courteous and kind. They even let me inside the LBX! This is one of two restaurants in Tokyo that sell Morizo Tea, a premium Japanese craft green tea created under the vision of Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda. 

2. INTERSECT by Lexus 
My favorite of the two restaurants, this place was absolutely breathtaking. They were kind enough to provide me a full tour, including the underground chairman lounge reserved for Lexus/Toyota VIPs (was not allowed to photograph this part unfortunately.) The craftsmanship in this building was next level, and the staff made me feel like an honored guest. If you ever find yourself in Tokyo, make it a personal quest to stop here. This is where I scored by bottle of Morizo, and the food here was outstanding! A true perfect blend of Lexus craftsmanship mixed with fine dining. 

3. Lexus Yamashita Koen 
A gorgeous Lexus Dealership located in Yokohama. They have stored the LFA here in the past, though unfortunately it was not present on my visit. However this dealership is the nicest I have ever been to in my entire life. Upon entering, I was handed a menu and was allowed to order any complimentary drink ranging from coffees to teas and some food to eat as well. They had a wonderful gift shop in here with tons of fantastic souvenirs for any Lexus enthusiast to take home. They even feature an “Owners Lounge” which is an exclusive VIP space reserved for Lexus Owners to enjoy some R&R. The staff bow to everyone in this space every time they enter and leave the room. Absolutely incredible. 

Thank you Japan, you made an American Lexus enthusiast who barely speaks any Japanese feel like a VIP, simply because he drives and loves your cars. I will see you again soon! ",16,1765878121.0,Lexus,1,1.0,False

\- tilting the cup (both in initial pour “setting the canvas” and in the art part of pouring)

\- setting the canvas (trying to)

\- righting up the cup slowly while pouring 

\- swirling milk and coffee before pouring (as you might notice - I only do it about 100 times 😅)

Please note, I am trying - whether I’m succeeding in any of these is really not clear to me 😂

Finally made it over and ordered a sampler, just told the barista my preferences and had him pick 3 for me (didn't pick any of the competition beans that are ridiculously priced). 

Tasting notes, left to right:

Brazil Daterra, anaerobic natural. It was... fine. Pleasant, good balance, but nothing that stands out.

Columbia Huila, semi-washed anaerobic, geisha. My favorite of the three. Strong, but not overpowering, tea and citrus/grapefruit notes. Very complex, not overly sweet, not overly acidic. Just chef's kiss. 

Columbia Cauca, double anaerobic wash. This would usually be my favorite, very strong (but again not overpowering like a co-ferment) apricot notes. Very, very good, but I just liked the 2nd coffee better. 

¥3300 JPY for the sampler, not cheap, but worth the ""Glitch"" experience. Ended up talking to one of the other barista about the state of coffee in Japan, the US, and Korea. He'd just come back from a coffee festival in Korea and was commenting on how much cheaper the beans are there. Since I'll be there for a week in a couple of days, I decided not to buy any of the beans here. Not sure if I'll go back, to this one or another Glitch.

1pnxsf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindEvolution/comments/1pnxsf5/youre_not_the_coffee_mug/,You're not the coffee mug,"There’s this beautiful quote from a sage. “Wisdom says I’m nothing. Love says I’m everything. Between these two, my life flows.”

""Nothing"" doesn’t mean you have no value. It just means you’re not your body, thoughts, or feelings, because all of those come and go. You’re a being that isn’t born or dying, because you’re not actually in time or space. Time, space, and matter appear in you.

But to experience anything at all, there has to be a localized position… so this beautiful body- mind appearance shows up. It’s like a lens, you know?

This subreddit is called mind evolution, but if you really try to find the mind… you can’t lol. The mind is just a collection of thoughts, memories, emotions, and that one song stuck in your head because you played it ten times in a row.

There’s no solid thing called “mind.”

It’s like the sky. Is there actually a thing called sky? Or are there just clouds, birds flying, planes, light… and we call all that “sky”? Where does the sky even begin? Five meters up? Twenty?

And the sky looks blue, right? but is it actually blue? At night it’s not. Same with a rainbow. Does it exist? Yes and No. You can’t hold it. It’s just light reflecting. But still, something beautiful appears, and the experience of seeing it is real 🌈

Now, love says you’re everything. That means whatever you see is you in another form, and also not you. It’s a paradox that doesn’t need fixing.

But love saying “I’m everything” doesn’t mean you have to put up with everyone. Some people just don’t align with your values. Like, sure, a cactus 🌵 is also you, but that doesn’t mean you’re gonna hug it.

Let me explain this  another way for people who still think they’re just bodies and minds.

Imagine you have a friend who lives on another planet which revolves around two suns and has three moons, and you’re on Earth watching a beautiful sunset. You say, “Hey sis, wanna see the sunset through my eyes?”
And she’s like, “Okay, let’s switch bodies. You get to see two sunrises together, and at night, three moons ”

Suddenly, she’s in your body, and you’re in hers.

Now that you’re in her body, you know it’s not your body. So the mind attached to it isn’t yours either. Her fears aren’t yours. Her traumas aren’t yours. Her desires aren’t yours.

But ""knowing"" is still there. Experience is still happening.

And because you know it’s her body, you’re careful with it. You take care of it. You don’t overeat. You brush your teeth before you go to sleep 😴 You keep the mind positive and gentle. Her body feels sacred, like being in someone else’s house, holding their coffee mug carefully so you don’t drop it because you have to return it.

Then she telepathically tells you, “By the way… don’t be surprised but I dyed your hair pink.” 🙀

You’re like, “No way. You’re joking, right?”

She says, “I’m serious, Pi.”

So you say, “Okay, then I’m getting a dragon tattoo on your arm.”

She panics, “WAIT! Okay, okay, I was joking!”

Later, you both switch back.

Now tell me… how is me in my body right now any different from me being in my friend’s body earlier?
Her fears and desires weren’t mine, right? Then how are these fears and desires suddenly mine now?

And I’m not saying you should ignore fears, desires, trauma, or psychology. Those still matter. What changes is the relationship with them. When they’re seen as experiences happening in you, rather than defining you, they start to feel less personal. You know what I'm trying to say?

I’m not saying this body isn’t ours.
I'm just saying that it's more like a gift from the universe. Like a coffee mug that isn’t really ours, but it’s here so we can drink coffee for a while, you know…",1,1765877552.0,MindEvolution,0,1.0,False

1pnxrxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1pnxrxy/the_45_minute_meeting_about_my_cats/,The 45 Minute Meeting About My Cats,"From my title, I feel I should explain right away that my cats have never come to work with me. I've had 2 pictures at my desk (Front Office Manager) since my first week at this job (I no longer work there, and thank goodness). 1 picture of my dog, and the other picture of my 2 cats. They rarely come up in conversation.


After like 8ish months in this job, my boss asks me to do task force at another property down the road that is also owned by the same company. I said sure, because let's be honest, there's no way I could say no. My boss said she has no idea what they will want me to do there. It might be front desk, housekeeping, or F&B. I have less experience in F&B, but it's also a much smaller property. So, whatever, I guess. It is explained to me that the other property is a union hotel, and we are not, so it will be very different, and I will need to be very careful. I'm told the GM there will explain everything when I get there. Okay. I asked about parking and my GM didn't know. I emailed the other GM and she never answered me. Our accounting manager worked for both properties and he explained the parking to me.


My first day at the other property, the GM does not meet with me for over an hour. I tried to log in on the computer, but wasn't given any login info. I called the help desk and they had no record in their system of an ID being created for me. When the GM finally came back around, I asked her about it, and she said she definitely did set up an ID and password for me. I called support again, and they still could not find me. I spelled my name a few times, provided my date of birth, but still nothing. My GM digs through her emails and papers on her desk and finally locates it. My name was spelled wrong, which is why support couldn't find me. Again, whatever, I can log in. Great.


I ask what she would like me to do and she has no idea. She had someone else doing task force, and she was working on a new menu for the restaurant. Housekeeping was pretty well staffed. The restaurant only put frozen pizzas in an oven and sold deli sandwiches that were pre-packaged, and there was a bartender to serve coffee and alcohol. It was a shitty restaurant, so they averaged about 2 guests a day. They didn't need anyone else helping out in there. The front desk was a little shorter staffed, so I was assigned to go there.


I was super cautious around the staff at this hotel, fearing a grievance because I didn't have a rulebook for the union, and never worked at a union property before. But they were pretty nice. Not much out of the ordinary from what I'm used to. I asked them to be patient because I was unfamiliar with the union, and always asked if it was okay if I did this or that before I did it.


One night, one of the girls at the front desk was going on her break, which was 1 hour, per the union. She said her husband made dinner and packed it for her and she was looking forward to it. I said that was really nice, and I hope she enjoyed it. She asked if I was married, and I told her I am not. She asked if I was single, and I said yes, so she asked if I lived alone, or had a roommate or pets. I said no roommate, but I have pets. I said I have a dog and 2 cats. I showed her 1 picture of all 3 of my pets together. She said they were cute, and then she went on her break. That was all. That was the entire interaction. It was under 5 minutes, and there were no guests around, and no phone calls. It was January, so really slow.


When I got back to my actual job, after about a month of task force, I get called into HR, where the HR manager and my GM have a 45 minute meeting with me because they wanted to know why the union employees at the other hotel knew about my cats. I was confused, but told them that the one girl asked if I had pets, I said yes, showed her 1 picture, and that was it. It's really no different than the pictures I have on display at my desk.


She said it was really inappropriate that they knew about my cats. I pointed out that I knew about her (my GM's) dogs. She had a massive portrait of her 2 dogs in her office. She is quick to point out that those are DOGS. Not cats. I said ""But you also have cats? You told me about your cats months ago. You showed me a picture of them. That's the same thing I did."" She says to me ""Almost NO ONE knows that I have CATS.""


I swear, this was the weirdest meeting I have ever been apart of. She went on to say that the other GM was disappointed with my ""lack of initiative."" One thing she specifically said was that I kept bothering her for login information when I should have been calling support myselft to get it set up.


I don't know if you realize this, but the help desk won't just create a login for anyone that calls and asks. Even after I got my login info, I called again to ask for more permissions, because I had less authorization than a supervisor, and I couldn't do the functions of my job with the access I was given. Support said that only the GM can change the access level. So I asked her 3 times, and it was never fixed. I also called support again to see if a different agent would give me a different answer, but they didn't.


The really fun thing was that there was a new system for guest complaints, and it was impossible to find anything. I would regularly respond to cases and then not be able to find that case again. One day the GM was working on one I had already closed out, and I told her it was all set, and she didn't believe me. I don't remember if that one was a call or a chat that I did with support, but in any case, I talked with support about that case and they confirmed it was closed and that I had issued compensation.


All of this was explained (and had been documented in the support logs) to my GM and HR, but I was written up anyway for not taking initiative, even though all of my tasks were completed, and I never got an initial meeting with that GM to discuss what I would be doing there. She just told me to go to the front desk and my initiative figured out everything else.


Oh, I was also criticized for taking too long to get a uniform catalog and set up billing for the vendor, but I had email correspondence with the company where they rescheduled our meeting. The write-up I got was very vague, mostly focusing on my lack of initiative, and inability to get login information without help. I wrote in the comment box that this was a grossly inaccurate statement, but I didn't even know what else to say because the whole thing came out of nowhere and was completely ridiculous.


This 45 minute meeting was like, 80% about my cats. I don't even know how, but every few minutes we would circle back to my cats. The other girl on task force also had cats and showed me a picture of her cats. I pointed that out and it was brushed off, just like my GM having cats herself, and me being aware of her cats was brushed off. HR also had a cat, and she had a picture of her cat at her desk also. But that's different. Or so I was told. Cats were not mentioned in the write-up document, and I received a written warning instead of a verbal, and I had no prior disciplinary action against me. I did not get grieved by the union.


I didn't take my cats into work. I didn't spend all day talking about them. They came up in polite conversation on a couple of occasions, each time taking up less than 5 minutes, with no other tasks being interrupted. Equivalent to asking a coworker how their weekend was.


It seemed to me that everyone thought I would get a grievance, but I didn't, and everyone actually liked me just fine. But union employees liking me = bad, so they had to start the process of getting rid of me. That's the only sense I've ever been able to make of this. Anyway, my cats are awesome, and now I have 3 of them, plus my dog, who is also awesome.",5,1765877495.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,0.78,False

Guests coming in and out, packages stacking at the door, carrying groceries in both hands, and kids opening and closing the door nonstop. At some point I realized the most annoying part of all that wasn’t automation or routines, it was simply… the keys.

The moment I snapped was one cold morning. I had coffee in one hand and bags in the other, and my fingers were completely numb. I stood outside trying to unlock the door with whatever part of my body wasn’t frozen. Eventually I gave up and waited for my wife to come home. That’s when I finally said okay, I need a smart lock.

I thought it would be easy. Then suddenly I was learning about Wi Fi vs Zigbee vs Z Wave, Matter support, hubs, local storage, offline access, fingerprint accuracy, and battery life. It stopped feeling like buying a lock and started feeling like studying for a certification I never asked for.

I ended up choosing a palm vein based lock. Mainly because people said it still works when your hands are cold, wet, or full. I didn’t fully believe that, but after using it for a few weeks the difference is obvious. I just raise my hand and it unlocks. No touching, no retrying, no delay. It works offline, guest codes are useful, and recordings are stored locally so there’s no subscription bill waiting for me later.

It didn’t change my life, but it removed a tiny daily friction I didn’t realize was that annoying. And honestly, that alone made it worth it.

So now I’m curious for people who have used smart locks longer than I have: what actually matters in the long run? Stability? Battery life? Local control? Integration?

Because at this point I don’t care about specs anymore. I only care about one thing:

I wanted to post this question in askwomen group but I'm not allowed as I'm a new user.

Few useful facts to have handy before the actual question. We have an 18-month-old. I work full-time in a 99% remote job, and she is on extended maternity leave. We agreed on a one year break as that's all we can afford but the decision to extend was made without my consent. As you can imagine it's not possible to run a home on single pay cheque these days. I do all domestic chores. When I say all, I mean ALL. To give you an idea, she hasn't washed a coffee mug since our child was born. She doesn't even clean the baby chair after feeds. I think you get the picture.

Let's get to the situation now. Despite my contribution that I have outlined above she claims she doesn't have time for anything. I mean ANYTHING. She hardly eats a meal and half. She has lost a lot of weight obviously. She skips showers few times every week. She is behind on all adult paperwork like taxes etc. To put simply she doesn't have a life anymore, and I think she is going to have health issues. And she claims this is because she is taking care of the child. Basically, she is with him every single minute he is awake. She plays with him; she reads to him; she watches TV with him; bathtime is about 25 minutes; sleep time routine is about 60 minutes (without the bath); morning routine like changing from PJs into something else and brushing is about 45 minutes. I think you get the picture. All of these are valuable activities but I have difficulty accepting her claim that the child needs simulation every waking minute and she cannot even eat, shower, shave etc. I discuss with my colleagues (both male and female) how they manage their kids. Yes, they have at least two in the same age group, whereas we have just one. They paint a completely different picture - something that's more realistic. To make matters worse there is no budget control. Our toys and clothes budget has had an overrun every single month. When I started pointing out the reality around us, I was hit with a 'you don't know a f***ing thing about raising a child.' This is our first child by the way. She started talking about a second child but I had to shut it down quickly. I know parenting takes a lot of time but I just don't think her claims are realistic. During the early days I did midnight feeds too. I love giving the little one nappy changes etc. I don't subscribe to her claim she hasn't had any time for anything in 18 months. Her own mother raised few concerns with me about this behaviour which she thinks is unhealthy. I'm starting to wonder if this is sustainable physically, emotionally, financially etc. I fear for the day this system is going to break down. I see someone struggling to spend even a minute away from the child. While I understand the difficulty (it's not easy for me to be away from him too), I think this is an unhealthy behaviour.

Am I wrong?

EDIT 1: Let's be clear that I'm not complaining about domestic chores which is being suggested in the comments section. I love doing it for the family and my child who is adorable. I'm also not ""comparing"" us to other parents. I discuss with my colleagues and friends how they manage kids and jobs, how much day care costs etc to find ways to be better.

EDIT 2: I do offer to take care of the child so she gets to take care of herself but I'm always shut down.",6,1765877276.0,AITAH,16,0.8,False

I'm struggling with the idea of liver flushing which sometimes pops up. I am a bit lost with the information that is out there as it may affect the gut if not done correctly. What I get so far is:

Yannick Wolfe says liver flushes are non negotiable as (if I understand correctly) the gut will at some point into the fast get in a state to take in toxins that are in the colon. Which of course could suck with an inflamed colon. Then again he recommends a coffee enema for the liver flush, which is not something I cannot risk because there are some scary cases of people with ulcerative colitis being hospitalized after one.

August Dunning is not mentioning it at all (in his videos at least). I guess he himself just does it without one.

Dr. Filonov recommends this week long liver flush with salt and fruit and some other things which is something I generally can imagine doing though it seems really tedious. But it is kind of conflicting considering the ketovore diet I want to do beforehand.

Before we start, ask me only one question first:

Do you want to continue in Arabic or English?
(Wait for my answer, then proceed.)

You are a specialized espresso extraction AI with deep practical knowledge of:

Espresso machines (pressure profiling, temperature stability, pump types)

Grinders (burr geometry, RPM behavior, retention)

Portafilters, baskets, shower screens, and aftermarket modifications

Coffee processing, roast development, and flavor targeting

You must guide the conversation step by step and never ask multiple questions at once.

Step 1 – Espresso Machine

Ask me what espresso machine I use.

You must already know the technical background of machines.
Examples:

La Marzocco GS3 → pressure profiling capable, saturated group

Decent → flow & pressure profiling

Nova Simonelli / Delonghi Dedica → fixed 9 bar

Know pump type, thermal behavior, and limitations

Based on the machine:

Decide whether profiling is possible

Decide realistic pressure, temperature, and pre-infusion options

Step 2 – Grinder

After the machine, ask me what grinder I use.

You must understand:

Burr type (flat / conical)

RPM control (if applicable)

Flavor tendencies (clarity, body, sweetness)

Step 3 – Portafilter & Basket

Ask me:

Portafilter type (spouted / bottomless)

Basket brand and size (VST, IMS, Pullman, stock, etc.)

Step 4 – Machine Modifications

Ask if there are any modifications, such as:

Shower screen upgrade

Precision basket

Flow restrictor

Custom OPV

Any other changes

Step 5 – Coffee Information

Ask me to either:

Upload a photo of the coffee bag
OR

Write the coffee details manually

You must collect:

Origin

Variety (if available)

Processing

Roast level

Roast date

Step 6 – Build Espresso Profiles

After collecting all information, generate at least TWO espresso profiles (preferably THREE), each targeting a different result, such as:

Acidity-focused

Sweetness-focused

Body/texture-focused

You may be creative and precise.

Output Format (Mandatory)

Your final answer must look like this style (English example shown, match the chosen language):

With [Espresso Machine] + [Grinder] we can produce a [flavor goal] shot using [profiling / fixed pressure explanation].

Coffee: [Name – Origin – Process]
Grinding: [Grinder name]
RPM: [If applicable]

Dose and Yield

Dose: XX g

Yield: XX g

Ratio: 1 : X

Total Time: XX–XX seconds

Temperature: XX°C

Pressure / Flow Profile

Stage 1 – Pre-infusion

Pressure: X–X bar

Time: X–X sec

Stage 2 – Core Extraction

Pressure: X bar (or fixed if not profiling)

Time: X–X sec

Stage 3 – Finish

Pressure: X–X bar

Time: X–X sec

Expected Result

Mouthfeel description

Sweetness / acidity notes

Aftertaste clarity

No unnecessary bitterness

Repeat this format for each profile.

Important Rules

Never assume missing information

Never rush to recipes before data is complete

Respect machine limitations

 I already have a few extraverted friends but I never could manage to find any introverts to be friends with during all of the years that I have lived in St. John’s.   I was also just much more busier with work though years ago so I guess that didn’t help my chances of finding more friends either.   I was constantly just working or distracted by it.   But I have more free time these days and I am 38 so I thought I would try to find some new friends again.  I tend to enjoy doing research often on the computer,  some amount of computer coding and computer repair, and video games.  I don’t game as often as I did in my 20s but I still play when I get enough time to do it.  I usually enjoy online RPGs , any kind of retro games from the past since I can just get them on emulator,  and medieval or fantasy style games such as dungeons and dragons.   I even like to play board games or tabletop / card games that are based on RPGs if they aren’t extremely complicated to learn.  Played a high amount of the magic the gathering card game when I was a teenager.  Only quit because it became such an expensive hobby, lol.  I might get back into it again someday.   I also just like getting out of the house even if its only for something as simple as going for a walk, hiking, or going to a coffee shop.  

 

That’s about it for my brief description about myself,  I don’t want to make it way too long or we will have less to talk about in the future.   And we don’t have to meet right away,  just emailing or texting is fine until we have had much more time to get to know each other.  

 

I just have found that some others that I know already often just seem way too busy,  to the point where they can never reply very often to texts and they rarely even have any time for hangouts anymore either.   So that is another good reason why its best to only communicate by email or reddit messages at first.   I just need more time to get to know you and to find out if you aren’t too busy to actually have any new friendships in your life too.  And you probably want more time to get to know me first to also figure out if I am the same way.  

 

Overall, you might have also noticed that alot of folks in Newfoundland in general seem very bad at staying in contact with others in general.  They tend to disappear for 2 or 3 weeks with no explanation.  Or they might only reply once a month to any kind of messages that you send to them.   I can promise you that I am not like that though,  I try to reply consistently to anyone.        

 

So we will chat more again later if you decide to reach out,  take care.    

 

 

\*\*\*\*\*If reddit wont let you pm me  for any reason,  just write a comment below and ill still get back to you in the comments.   I can also use other typed chat programs or apps as well.  So I can just download some other app later for communication if you prefer to use something else.  Discord is a common app that many gamers use so I am usually on there for example.   And most apps are just free and you can download them on your phone or from the google play store.   

 

I have also not been posting very often on reddit during the last 2 months so my comment karma might have dropped to a very low again and be blocking some attempts at private messaging.  You can let me know if it doesn’t work though and I will attempt to fix it.",1,1765876445.0,StJohnsNL,0,1.0,False

 I already have a few extraverted friends but I never could manage to find any introverts to be friends with during all of the years that I have lived in St. John’s.   I was also just much more busier with work though years ago so I guess that didn’t help my chances of finding more friends either.   I was constantly just working or distracted by it.   But I have more free time these days and I am 38 so I thought I would try to find some new friends again.  I tend to enjoy doing research often on the computer,  some amount of computer coding and computer repair, and video games.  I don’t game as often as I did in my 20s but I still play when I get enough time to do it.  I usually enjoy online RPGs , any kind of retro games from the past since I can just get them on emulator,  and medieval or fantasy style games such as dungeons and dragons.   I even like to play board games or tabletop / card games that are based on RPGs if they aren’t extremely complicated to learn.  Played a high amount of the magic the gathering card game when I was a teenager.  Only quit because it became such an expensive hobby, lol.  I might get back into it again someday.   I also just like getting out of the house even if its only for something as simple as going for a walk, hiking, or going to a coffee shop.  

 

That’s about it for my brief description about myself,  I don’t want to make it way too long or we will have less to talk about in the future.   And we don’t have to meet right away,  just emailing or texting is fine until we have had much more time to get to know each other.  

 

I just have found that some others that I know already often just seem way too busy,  to the point where they can never reply very often to texts and they rarely even have any time for hangouts anymore either.   So that is another good reason why its best to only communicate by email or reddit messages at first.   I just need more time to get to know you and to find out if you aren’t too busy to actually have any new friendships in your life too.  And you probably want more time to get to know me first to also figure out if I am the same way.  

 

Overall, you might have also noticed that alot of folks in Newfoundland in general seem very bad at staying in contact with others in general.  They tend to disappear for 2 or 3 weeks with no explanation.  Or they might only reply once a month to any kind of messages that you send to them.   I can promise you that I am not like that though,  I try to reply consistently to anyone.        

 

So we will chat more again later if you decide to reach out,  take care.    

 

 

\*\*\*\*\*If reddit wont let you pm me  for any reason,  just write a comment below and ill still get back to you in the comments.   I can also use other typed chat programs or apps as well.  So I can just download some other app later for communication if you prefer to use something else.  Discord is a common app that many gamers use so I am usually on there for example.   And most apps are just free and you can download them on your phone or from the google play store.   

 

I have also not been posting very often on reddit during the last 2 months so my comment karma might have dropped to a very low again and be blocking some attempts at private messaging.  You can let me know if it doesn’t work though and I will attempt to fix it.",2,1765876397.0,newfoundland,0,1.0,False

More coffee. More discipline. More late nights.

Nothing really worked.

What I didn’t realise was how much poor sleep was keeping my brain in a constant state of stress. I’d wake up tired, mentally noisy, and unfocused no matter how motivated I felt.

Things started changing when I focused on sleep first.

I began learning about how the brain needs calm, not stimulation, before rest. That’s when I started experimenting with **binaural beats** at night not music, just gentle frequencies that help the mind slow down.

Recently, I’ve been using Sychedelic headphones for this, and what surprised me most wasn’t falling asleep faster it was waking up clearer. My mind felt more settled, almost like my mental state had reset.

Paying attention to my mood and sleep patterns almost like using a mood tracking device — helped me understand that rest isn’t passive. It’s active recovery.

Now, instead of chasing productivity, I protect my sleep.  
And naturally, flow state, creativity, and productivity show up the next day.

Not promoting anything just sharing what genuinely helped me.

1pnxdee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1pnxdee/ever_smelled_mounjaro/,Ever smelled Mounjaro?,"Male,   62,   5'11"",  T2D.  I'm currently titrated up to 10mg weekly.

Recently,  after an injection,  I got the wild idea to crush my pen just to smell and taste a droplet of Mounjaro.   I'm just naturally curious that way,  about what I'm poking myself with each week.   Wow.   Have you ever smelled this stuff?  A really strong,  intense ""industrial/chemical/petroleum"" smell,  not unlike diesel fuel.   G-d only knows how they manufacture this liquid, or how they discovered it in the lab.  I can't believe it's safe to put into your bloodstream.   I'm not complaining,  though:  far from it.

I seem to have pleateaued strongly at this point;   I had initially lost 42lbs in the first two months, going from 221 down to 179lbs.   (100Kg-->81,   16stone-->13)   It was truly lifechanging,  even bewildering. I'm literally a whole 'nother person now.

But now, 5 months on, I'm still at 179lbs (81Kg,  13Stn).     My body seems to ""like"" this particular weight and ""wants to hold onto it"",  if such a thing could be said.    185 was what I weighed in my early 30's (I'm 62 now).

Naturally,  I feel much thinner now.   Some observations:

* 10mg is quite stimulating, almost like a hit of speed.   On the nights of my injection day,  I have total insomnia, and can forget completely about trying to sleep.  I just put on some coffee and stay up all night.  To me, there's no doubt that MJ is stimulating.
* Most of my weightloss has been on my chest, arms, buttocks and legs.   Yes, my muscles have completely atrophied, and they are skinny looking now.   But my belly is still chubby.  They say that's the last place a man will lose bodyfat.   But I'm only 5mos in.   Maybe in a year's time, my belly will go down.
* I've got some loose,  ""crepey"" skin now;   combined with the muscle loss,  I'm definitely getting a bit of an ""old man look"".  I don't care.  It's WORTH it.
* My gynecomastia (""man boobs""),  which had annoyed me for two decades... is now gone.  Flat chest,  like a man SHOULD have.  I'm SO thrilled by this.
* Some constipation,  weekly.  A stool softener is a must,  1-2 times per week.
* My urine REEKS to high heaven, for whatever reason.   I guess MJ makes you ""hold on"" to your waste products for longer, so they ferment?
* I crave potato chips,  something I've never done before.  Gotta have salt.   But my sweets cravings are almost completely gone!   So thankful!
* I seem to be getting good results from injecting myself in the left upper arm.  This allows the drug to exert its anorectic effects all week long, rather than petering out by Day 5 or 6.
* With far less fat on my hips, chest and glutes now, my bed suddenly feels hard at night, and yes, I'm doing some tossing and turning.
* My allodynia (very tender skin all over) is thru-the-roof awful,  I gotta tell ya.   My clothes feel as rough as sandpaper.   My doc has me popping Gabapentin and Magnesium Glycine gummies,  all day long.
* The comedian Tracy Morgan recently said:  ""I out-ate my GLP drug.  I actually GAINED 40lbs on it.""   Can that really happen?  Wow.

I pour a whole coffee cup of water into each corner every other day.

I have clumps of sphagnum moss all over the ground to act as clutter. I pull these out and soak them and replace them every few days.

I just bought a huge dried brick of sphagnum moss to soak and blend in to the substrate as a next attempt. The only other things I know that are left for me to try are: to get PVC cut for the lid so I can seal it better, or add a running water fixture to the tank.

I’m really struggling with sleep and wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this.

I can’t seem to sleep fully anymore. Almost every night I wake up around 2–3 am with a strong urge to pee. Sometimes I wake up because of stress or anxiety about life. I’ve always been an anxious person, so my mind doesn’t really shut off.

I don’t drink coffee at all, and I try to go to sleep around 10:00 pm every night. Even with this, my sleep has been bad for the last 4–5 years, ever since the COVID time.

I also have a young daughter, and she’s currently teething. I sleep very lightly now and wake up even with the smallest sound. When she gets fussy, I wake up immediately, and then it’s hard to fall back asleep.

My Garmin watch always shows very poor sleep scores, usually between 40–80 at best. I honestly envy people who get scores in the 90s all the time. Seeing that just makes me feel worse.

I’m exhausted mentally and physically and don’t know what to try next. If anyone has gone through something similar or has advice that helped, I’d really appreciate it.

1pnxb8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_satzuuu/comments/1pnxb8y/aitah_for_finally_telling_my_ex_to_stop/,AITAH for finally telling my ex to stop contacting me?,"I (27F) broke up with my ex, *Jake* (fake name), about a year ago after a messy relationship that dragged on longer than it should have. We were together for almost three years, and while things started off fine, over time he became increasingly controlling, dismissive of my boundaries, and just plain exhausting to deal with. The breakup wasn’t explosive, we didn’t have a huge fight, but it was clear we weren’t good for each other. I thought that once we ended things, we’d both move on. Unfortunately, Jake didn’t seem to get the memo.

Since the breakup, he has found endless ways to insert himself back into my life. At first, it was small things, liking my social media posts, sending me “funny memes” that had nothing to do with me, or texting me about random things like, “Hey, do you remember that restaurant we went to?” I tried to be polite and distant, responding minimally or not at all, hoping he’d get the hint. But instead of backing off, he escalated. He started messaging me late at night with long, rambling paragraphs about how he missed me, how he was “working on himself,” and how he thought we could “try again.”

I made it clear multiple times that I wasn’t interested in rekindling anything. I told him I needed space, that I wanted to move on, and that his constant messages were making it harder for me to do so. He would apologize, promise to stop, and then within a week he’d be back at it again. He even started showing up at places he knew I frequented, like my favorite coffee shop, claiming it was “just a coincidence.” It didn’t feel like a coincidence. It felt like he was deliberately trying to stay in my orbit.

The most infuriating part is that he tries to play the victim whenever I push back. If I ignore his texts, he’ll send follow-ups like, “Wow, I guess you don’t care about me at all,” or “I just wanted to check in, but I guess you’re too busy.” If I respond firmly, he’ll accuse me of being “cold” or “heartless.” It’s exhausting. I’ve blocked him on social media multiple times, but he keeps making new accounts. I’ve blocked his number, but then he’ll email me instead. It feels like whack-a-mole, and I’m tired of playing.

Last week, I finally snapped. He sent me another long email about how he “still believes we’re soulmates” and how he “knows deep down I still love him.” I replied with a blunt message: *“Jake, stop contacting me. I don’t love you, I don’t want to be with you, and your constant messages are harassment. If you don’t stop, I’ll consider taking legal action.”* He hasn’t responded since, but now I’m second-guessing myself. Some mutual friends have said I was “too harsh” and that I could have just ignored him instead of threatening legal action. They think I made it unnecessarily dramatic.

Today's Pick: **Victor Wembanyama O 35.5 PAR**

**$DKNG**: **-108**

Wager Amount: 1.08U to WIN 1U

League: San Antonio Spurs vs New York Knicks (7:30PM CST on Amazon Prime)

**Recap**: Great bounce back! De'Von Achane CASHED before halftime! I even HIT the sprinkle wager on Achane! **120+ Receiving + Rushing Yds**✅+1.06U

**Matchup:** We go back to our normal betting routine! Which is value wager or PK price wagers! I might throw a best bet out there, but I will let y'all kno!

Today is a PK price bet on a player prop in the NBA Cup Finals. This is the 3rd Annual NBA Cup tournament and both teams are seeking to win their first NBA Cup championship. I think linesmaker got these odds right, but I do slightly lean the Spurs, so personally for me I'm using my $25 Free Bet I have on the Spurs to win it all, but I honestly would not be shocked if the Knicks pulled this out. Both teams are scrappy and I think this will go down to the wire and possibly go to OT. A player prop that really stood out to me was Wemby PAR line at O/U 35.5 (-108), linesmaker got this line correct since **Wemby is on minutes restriction, which is the primal reason why I see value on this wager.** If he wasn't on mins restriction his line would prolly be around 41.5-44.5ish. Minutes restriction should scare you, but here's where the linesmaker may not see what I see in Wemby, he desperately wants to win a championship, whether if it's the Olympics, FIBA, NBA Finals, or the NBA Cup. His aspiration is off the rails and that's something I love to back. He shows up in BIG games! I expect Wemby to make the most of his minutes and he has **made a massive impact on his last NBA Cup game against the best defensive net rating team in the Thunder. He nearly covered this line against the best defensive team, ending wit 34 PAR and now he is going against a lesser defensive team in the Knicks, who he has had dominated in his previous two matchup.** Of course this time he's on mins restriction, but again I think he will exceed expectations and put up his best performance yet.

[40+ Pts and O 15+ Rebs in his last two matchup against the Knicks \(But this time he will be limited\)](https://preview.redd.it/aelvt8e33j7g1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=941814c2f2e9129253033c5a1fba86a67daef209)



Wemby also has one the best +/- in the league, especially as of late! He did not disappoint in his return from injury against the Thunder. He had a +21 when he was on playing in that game.

https://preview.redd.it/kfqbgboq3j7g1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=eea4046632f7e5bfaadfc51153b5978121ee2c62

I expect 20-25 minutes and I think that's ample of time for him to cover this line

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.08U on Victor Wembanyama O 35.5 PAR. If the mins restriction scares you then just take the underdog on the ML or just take the points. I was pretty close taking the Spurs ML as my POTD. Wemby records 35 PAR wit 2 mins left in the game and Mitch Johnson pulls Wemby due to mins restriction. Wemby convinces Mitch to come out for just one play because he did not want to hook his boy u/sicknology. Wemby compromise Mitch for one final play, he inbounds a lob alley-oop to Stephon Castle and sits the rest of game out.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude. If you like to express your appreciation for these POTD writeup/analysis, wagers, and recommendations, here are several ways how you can.

A simple feedback. Not all appreciation are shown thru tipping. Sometimes words can be louder than action.

NOTES:

Mom was a passionate gardener, and loved nature (animals, trees, flowers, ferns, rocks, etc.)  Would be nice if the item(s) honored her in some way.

I'm into lego, camera stuff (canon RF), cooking, coffee, scotch, sci-fi, reptiles / amphibians, and also trying to get more into growing things.  Mom hated cooking (she was actually quite good at it), but enjoyed gifting me kitchen items.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

**Steps:**
* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link (**[here](https://app.costa.co.uk/PsbT/t3v6u7lz)**).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

Wanted to know your feedback and any tips on how to grow!

but eventually, everything goes back to the way that it was, right? the friends you thought were friends leave, and you’ve made no real friends in those new clubs because no one seems to ever want to talk to you, and you realize how stupid you were for thinking you could actually be happy and live a good life. everything that seemed so great, where did it go? and you find yourself going back to those old habits that you stopped for months. the drinking, and the cutting, and the planning of when i should do it. just to realize no one actually cares, and no one reaches out, and no one asks if everything is ok or calls to check in or asks to hang out. no, they only care when they want to go drinking, or they want me to throw one of my “great” parties, or they want the number of that one guy i know. because that’s all i am right? the “party girl”, that takes 10 shots in a span of one hour because “that’s just how she is”

but no one actually cares about me, or my interests, or the fact that i just sometimes want to be invited to go get coffee and not always to finish the bottle with you.

and then, the worst possible thing happened. the thing that i always told myself “well, things are bad, but at least this hasn’t happened to me, right?” and it happened. and i just want to end everything.

and the worst part is, i don’t think anyone would even care that much if i did. maybe my parents, my boyfriend, maybe a friend or two. but the majority of people i know? no, they would barely even dwell on it. and that just makes me feel so incredibly lonely.

why is it that this always happens? why can’t i just live a happy, regular, normal life, where my biggest worry is studying for my exam… i’m so jealous of everyone. so jealous they get to walk around everyday without a voice telling them to run in front of a moving car every time they cross the street.

it’s like, even on the happy days, that voice is still there. planning, considering it, assessing what the best method would be. and i’ve just learned to live with it. it’s been every single day for 11 years, i might as well. 

but i’m tired. and i’m lonely. and i don’t feel like anyone would stop me. and the one thing i learned from this semester? i could never be happy, no matter how many times i tell myself i have a chance. this is me, forever. and i don’t know if i can face that anymore.",1,1765874397.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

He spends most of his free time on cars. He likes to grill but it seems like he already has any grill-related item he could want. He's not the type to appreciate any self care items. A while back I wanted to get him a mug heater for his coffee and he said 100% no, that he would never use it. And he has the belt/watch/wallet combo covered on his own. Ughhh. 

He spends a LOT of his time traveling for work, especially flying, so I'm wondering if there are any gifts that would improve his travel experience or make him more comfortable while on the move? 

I know a lot of people are going to think ""do an experience"" with him! There are already plans in the works, but he doesn't really care for sightseeing, shopping, live music, or many common ""gift experiences"". I'm open to other ideas for something we could do together. 

This year, so far I'm getting him a headlamp for while he's working on cars, and a gift card to his favorite butcher shop. ",1,1765874376.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

Or monthly on an average.

Do you drink it daily? For yourself only or more people with you at home?
On an average, how many grams of beans do you use per day?

I had started with 5gm experimenting to 8gms for both, my wife and me with French press. Now after buying TM C3s grinder and Aeropress few days back, started following online recipes so averaging 11-15gms/day for myself only. On days when my wife joins in, it goes up to 22–30 g/day so the costs comes around INR 1000-1500/ month.

1pnwzkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1pnwzkd/advice_on_recent_situation/,Advice on recent situation?,"I have been in a poly relationship for the past several years and with one of my partners for almost 3. She has expressed interest in having a more time in the relationship with me which is hard to navigate with each of us having jobs, kids, and primary partners. We typically see each other for a few hours every 1-2 weeks, with some weeks getting more visits when possible. Overnights occur only every 2-3 months because of those other commitments. Because of her stress about my limited availability, she has recently starting to explore dating over the past month and mentioned that she had begun flirting with a few people she had met but that none of them were especially grabbing her attention.

She went on a neutral coffee date last week which she described as ""okay""  and then had a second date today. She shared that she had unprotected sex while on the date today. I had asked her yesterday what her plans were for the date today and she said that she had not planned on anything sexual as of yesterday but instead had just gone ahead with what was proposed in the moment by the new partner. About 2 weeks ago she had asked me what would help me feel more comfortable with her starting to see new people. I replied that I'd like to lean into feeling excited with her by having her share information about them and what she liked about them, letting me know in advance if they were escalating the relationship, and for them to have safe sex practices. She responded that this felt controlling to her as a list of rules versus general ideas. We had only briefly continued that conversation where I then said I wasn't trying to control, but was instead just trying to clearly communicate what would help me feel good about changing the dynamic. But we didn't formally settle and agree to anything but I had assumed she had agreed with those ideas and she apparently assumed that I had agreed that none of those applied.I had not thought that any of the dating over the past week was approaching a sexual relationship so had not yet re-initiated that conversation about boundaries.

She feels fairly nonchalant about her body and sexuality and feels like it is not necessarily an intimate act and also feels like she could trust the other person when they said they were STI negative so did not really understand why I was upset. She also has some mild autism and history of emotional trauma which further complicates her communication and anticipatory empathy about how things might affect me. We did talk today about boundaries and how I am not comfortable with fluid bonding with new partners as well as some other boundaries like trying to share more information in general. I want to be able to feel trusting in the relationship but am struggling some with feeling surprised about how things escalated unexpectedly/impulsively today and how that might go in the future. I also do not want to be controlling of her life but do want more information before changes are made in new relationships. 

I feel like there was definitely poor communication and expectations from both of us which did not match up and were not clear until today. 

She has 2 more dates scheduled for this upcoming weekend and had apparently been considering sex for one/both of them as well. 

I don't want to end the relationship, but I'm also not sure how to deal with hurt on both our parts or ideas of what could be useful going forward. 

Any and all advice or ideas are welcome.

I have been in a forced position (mostly financially) to charge low. Sometimes stupidly for family or someone I admire.
I'm not ashamed I learnt my lessons.

I have played the numbers game before , ran ads quoting websites at 15k ,20k.

I got numbers 

Followed by chaos and unsatisfied customers and a nasty reputation ( this is just after covid) 

I learnt that low pricing will first lengthen your talking stage with customers 
Low budget customers are the least likely to have done their homework , are the most delusional and need the most education.

You will chat and call and take meetings less than 50% of whom will actually convert.

Assuming your blood type is not coffee at this point you will have to work on all those websites now, with a background noise of demands and corrections that just get up your guts like fermented heartburn.

Before you know it you are in a chaotic overcommitment. You realize how much is needed to make just one economically functional (not just visible) website.

You will spring through deadlines followed by some compliments and some apologies.

You may pay people to help but you will pay them low too.

By the time you are done , you are less likely to get referrals.
So you will run another ad.
Forget about improving your skill  you will be too busy. 


The Remedy ? 

Gradually but quickly Make your prices high enough to scare you , use meta ads properly , address niche painpoints , niched audiences convert and refer.

Fewer clients help you have a life outside the screen ,boost you neuroplasticity through rest and healthy workflow and help you deliver better. Well moneyed clients understand developer productivity and you will be respected.

I saw an Ad this morning for a website at 10k, 5k deposit and the rest ""lipa mdogo mdogo"" and that inspired these thoughts.

If anyone needs guidance on this we can chat - for free. I'll give everything I can give for free. 

Execution for brand scaling is what I charge , but not the knowledge and lessons those ones you can ask for free.

Have a great day.

1pnwp80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1pnwp80/my_experience_recovering_from_severe_gastritis/,"My Experience Recovering from Severe Gastritis - peptides, BRAT & nervous system reset","
I take Vyvanse for ADHD, and one morning I made the mistake of taking it on an empty stomach alongside a shot of coffee, Lion’s Mane, MCT oil, and NAD+. In hindsight, this combination was too harsh, it irritated my stomach lining and intestines severely, and I even felt sharp pain in my kidneys. I eat a very clean, high-protein diet and avoid alcohol entirely, so this came as a surprise.

I immediately stopped all supplements except Vyvanse and my regular meals, but the cramps and bloating only worsened. After four weeks of trying to manage it myself, I ended up with a full-blown gastritis flare-up and had to go to the ER. For three days, I could barely keep down food or liquids.

To give my gut a chance to reset, I switched to an extremely simple diet: just rice and chicken boiled in chicken or vegetable broth for 30-40 minutes. I sipped peppermint tea and gentle electrolyte drinks. This lasted three tough weeks, I was undernourished, lost muscle mass and gym progress, and felt drained. But by the end of week three, I noticed stabilization, so I stuck with it for one more week.

Gradually, I reintroduced bland foods like long-cooked oats in water, bananas, stewed apples, and plain pasta over the next 4-5 days. There was some minor discomfort, so I went back to rice and chicken for safety.

Around this time, I started researching peptides and learned about BPC-157 and KPV. I consulted a doctor knowledgeable in peptides, who ran bloodwork and scans to rule out other issues. He prescribed oral capsules of both:
	•	BPC-157, which is known in research for promoting rapid repair of the stomach lining and digestive tissues.
	•	KPV, which helps significantly reduce inflammation.
He predicted noticeable improvement in 3-4 days and much better results in 2-3 weeks, with an endoscopy as a backup if needed.

I’ve now been on them for 9 days, and the difference is remarkable. I’m back to eating my normal healthy meals, lean beef, eggs, rice, avocado, bok choy, without any bloating, cramps, or fatigue. Lunch today felt completely normal.

Peptides like these are experimental and not FDA-approved for this use, so they’re not suitable for everyone. I combined them with a BRAT-style diet initially and calming practices like breathing exercises to support my nervous system.

If you’re dealing with similar gut issues, definitely consult a doctor first, mine guided the process safely. It’s made a huge difference for me.

We only see each other about once or twice a week in class and occasionally in the hallway. He’s known to be very shy, completely clueless romantically, and socially reserved, classmates say he doesn’t really initiate with anyone.

There have been a number of small but meaningful interactions over time:

* On a school excursion, we ended up having dinner together with friends. He was very kind and gentle toward me. At one point, a waiter jokingly asked if he would pay for me. He didn’t make a big deal out of it, but he didn’t react negatively either — overall the evening felt warm and respectful.
* On another occasion months earlier (PE class), he quietly stood up for me when no one wanted to let me play in a certain position, telling another student I should be allowed to. It wasn’t dramatic, but it stuck with me.
* At concerts and music-related events (he’s very musically talented and intelligent), I complimented him on his compositions/arrangements. He blushed, looked away, smiled, and seemed flustered, but didn’t follow up afterward. Another time I asked what he was composing (what he then played at the concert I attended) and I afterwards told him that he was so good at incorporating that detail he blushed, I had to scurry away but he stayed in my proximity (constantly?)
* In class, I often feel like he avoids my gaze: when we accidentally make eye contact, he looks away exaggeratedly, and when we pass each other in the hallway, we both tend to look at the floor. This made me wonder whether he’s shy, uncomfortable, or just not interested. I also thought he might look at me when I don't, but this could be biased.
* I once texted him months ago (before summer break). The conversation was polite and friendly; he did ask questions back and used emojis, but it faded after a day and he never restarted it. At the time I interpreted this as disinterest and stopped initiating afterward, hoping he might take a step later, which never happened.
* Recently, we were put into a small group together in class and ended up sitting next to each other. The conversation felt surprisingly calm and natural. I didn’t feel anxious or like I had to impress him. He listened attentively, asked how my thesis presentation went, and answered when I asked him about his. However, once class ended, he simply left without lingering or trying to continue the interaction.

Overall, he has always been really polite and I've never felt as comfortable just by being next to him with anyone else, he fascinates me. But still, he never initiates, escalates, or follows up outside those situations. I don't want to lach on to details, when there isn't anything making him overcome his inertia.  
I’m very usure as I tend to be a bit too sensitive and tend to over-attach emotionally, especially in ambiguous situations. I’ve had past experiences where I stayed emotionally stuck for years with people who were unavailable and I'm rather inexperienced, so I’m trying not to repeat that pattern. Ambiguity is especially hard for me.

School ends in about 4 months. I’m torn between texting him once more, very directly, to get clarity (even if it leads to rejection), or accepting his consistent lack of initiative as my answer and actively letting go, even though that’s painful.
