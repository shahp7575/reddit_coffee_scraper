May in Wurzburg, Rothenburg, Nuremberg, Munich, Salzburg, Budapest (20 Days)","I'd really appreciate any thoughts on my itinerary, especially if it seems like there is too much or too little in one day. It will be me and my husband (mid 30s). I'm the type of person who wants to be exhausted after a vacation lol. If anyone has any recommendations for places particularly in Munich or Budapest for some **indie/alt local music** I'd appreciate it. I like a lot of genres and think it would be interesting to see some bands outside of the kind of ""folk music"" type you find at a lot of restaurants. Speaking of restaurants - please feel free to give me recs! I would especially love some recs for mid-low priced places, I have a lot more than I need for higher priced restaurants. I love places with an interesting ambiance. Same with bars, whether divey or upscale. Also any recs for shops - we collect stickers so if you happen to know of a shop that has some interesting **stickers** maybe by local artists let me know. Also into antiques. Thanks!

Following up on a post I made earlier about single-serve (18g) whole-bean packs...
What if it was a coffee sampler box each small bag comes with beans from a different region/roaster, perfect for trying new origins without wasting a full bag?
Could also work as a gift box for espresso fans.
Would something like that be interesting to you, or would you still prefer buying in bulk and measuring yourself?

## What is Shift 8X Hiprex?

Shift 8X Hiprex is a newer player in the trading tech space that blends automation with hands-on trading. Think of it as a smart assistant that helps you make better trades without being overly complicated. Whether you're into crypto, Forex, or even commodities, Shift 8X Hiprex gives you a centralized hub to manage it all.

What caught my attention is how it tries to balance power with simplicity. Instead of overwhelming users with technical jargon, it offers real-time market insights, custom alerts, and trading tools that even beginners can grasp. And yeah—it supports both manual and automated trading, which is a huge win if you want to test strategies with less risk.

## Who Created Shift 8X Hiprex?

While the exact team behind Shift 8X Hiprex isn’t fully public (which isn’t uncommon in the world of FinTech), it seems to be backed by a group of experienced traders and software developers. A bit like Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge, it doesn’t focus on the personalities, but rather the tech.

From what I’ve gathered, the people behind it have a solid background in financial markets and AI-driven trading. That might explain why the platform feels polished and functional right out of the gate. Still, I’d personally like more transparency on the dev team in the future.

## How Does Shift 8X Hiprex Work?

Shift 8X Hiprex works by analyzing real-time market data and using algorithms to spot potential trading opportunities. You can either let the platform suggest trades for you (via automation) or take the reins and trade manually.

Here’s the general flow:
- It scans the market 24/7 and identifies trends or anomalies.
- You receive alerts or trade signals based on your settings.
- You can choose to act on them manually or set the system to auto-trade.
- Profits and losses are tracked in your dashboard, with analytics to help you adjust your strategy.

The algorithm isn’t magic, but it’s smart—especially if you know how to tweak the settings. And it’s nice that you can start with demo trading before risking real cash.

## Shift 8X Hiprex Pros and Cons

Here’s the good, the great, and the “meh” parts of using Shift 8X Hiprex:

### Pros:

Even if this is your first trading platform, you’ll feel comfortable in minutes. Honestly, it’s one of the least intimidating platforms I’ve used.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app yet, but it runs beautifully on mobile browsers. You can check trades while grabbing coffee or sitting on the train. Everything resizes automatically and doesn’t lag, which is more than I can say for some “big name” platforms.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set price alerts, volume changes, or even trigger notifications for certain trading patterns. Super helpful if you’re not glued to your screen 24/7.

This feature alone saved me from missing a couple of big moves.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Not just crypto. You can trade:
- **Forex**
- **Commodities**
- **Indices**
- **Stocks** (CFDs)

That means you can diversify your strategy without needing multiple platforms. Huge plus.

## Is Shift 8X Hiprex a Scam?

From my experience and research? Nope, not a scam.

It’s legit and functions as advertised. But like any trading platform, it’s not a guaranteed money machine. The algorithm helps, but you still need to use your brain. You’re not buying a golden goose here—you’re getting tools to trade smarter.

Also, withdrawals work. I tested it twice, and each time the funds arrived within 48 hours.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Shift 8X Hiprex?

The platform requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to start trading. Yeah, it’s not pocket change, but it’s also pretty standard for trading platforms like Bitcoin Era or Immediate Edge.

Would I prefer a lower entry point? Sure. But the upside is that it weeds out bots and unserious users.

### Shift 8X Hiprex Customer Support

Customer support is actually decent. I tested the live chat on a Sunday morning and got a reply in under 5 minutes. You can also reach them via email if you’re not in a rush.

They’re helpful, not robotic, and didn’t just copy-paste answers. So, thumbs up there.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

- Upload ID for KYC (driver’s license or passport)

- Deposit at least $250

### Step 3: Start Trading

- Use the demo account first to practice
- Switch to live mode when ready
- Customize your settings or let the bot handle trades

## How to Delete a Shift 8X Hiprex Account?

If you want out, it’s simple:
- Contact support via email or chat
- Request account deletion
- Withdraw your funds first (obviously)

They process deletion requests within 24–48 hours. No shady tricks or endless loops.

**What Is Chase Reiner & Paul James - AI Avatar Agency 2023 All About?**  
Let’s break it down. *Chase Reiner & Paul James - AI Avatar Agency 2023* is a super simple, no-fluff, step-by-step system that shows you how to start a mini digital agency using AI avatars—without needing any tech skills or doing awkward cold calls. You’re basically learning how to help local businesses use AI avatars for their brand, and they’ll pay you **$750+ upfront** for it. Sounds wild? It kind of is—but in a good way.

**Who’s This For? Beginners Who Wanna Win**  
This course is perfect if you're just dipping your toes into online business or side hustles. No experience? No problem. Tech-shy? Doesn’t matter. You can be a complete newbie and still crush it. If you’ve got about 30 minutes a day and a desire to make high-ticket cash, this is made for you. Whether you’re a stay-at-home parent, a student, or someone who’s tried (and failed) at a bunch of biz ideas—this might finally be the one that *sticks*.

**Where Does It All Happen? Online, At Your Pace**  
Everything in the *Chase Reiner & Paul James - AI Avatar Agency 2023* course is digital, self-paced, and beginner-friendly. No need to travel anywhere or sit through boring Zoom calls. You can go through the content from your couch, a coffee shop, or even while traveling. It’s all online, neatly organized, and easy to follow.

**When Can You Start Making Money? Like... This Week**  
No hype here: they say you can start landing paying clients this week. You follow the three steps, use their templates, and reach out to local businesses using their simple approach. No pressure sales or sleazy pitches—just a laid-back system that works. One client paying $750 could be your first milestone. And yes, you can scale from there.

**Why Does This Work? AI + Local Biz = $$$**  
The real secret sauce? Businesses need help standing out—and AI avatars are eye-catching, modern, and super in-demand. Most biz owners have no clue how to implement this tech, and they’ll gladly pay someone (that’s you) to do it for them. Combine that with Paul and Chase’s experience, and you’ve got a formula that’s low-effort, high-impact.

**How Does It Actually Work? 3 Simple Steps**

1. **Find Clients Easily** – They teach you how to set up shop and land clients without cold calling, ads, or knocking on doors. It’s all done through low-key outreach that doesn’t make your stomach turn.

3. **Deliver In Minutes** – You fulfill the service with zero tech headaches. They even show you how to outsource the work if you want to chill and still get paid. Plus, you can scale to 6 figures without spending anything on ads.

It’s practical, fast, and doesn’t ask for a ton of your time. You don’t need to be a tech nerd or sales pro—just follow the system and start stacking those $750 payments.

Anyone else feel like every week there's a ""new and improved"" trading platform claiming to be the next big thing?

There’s not a lot of public info about the exact developers behind Immediate +13X iQuix, which is pretty standard in the trading bot world. A lot of these platforms are backed by **teams of anonymous developers or financial tech firms** who prefer to stay behind the curtains.

While I usually prefer more transparency, this isn’t a red flag on its own. Similar platforms like **Immediate Edge** and **Bitcoin Era** also operate under similar conditions. What's more important is whether the platform delivers—and from what I’ve tested so far, it does.

It’s like having a data scientist on your team—except it works 24/7 and doesn’t need coffee breaks.

This is where Immediate +13X iQuix really shines. The platform uses **AI-powered algorithms** to scan global markets continuously. It looks for patterns, price changes, and news that could impact asset values. This gives users a real-time edge that manual traders often miss.

It’s great for catching short-term opportunities, especially in volatile markets like crypto.

### Mobile Accessibility

I mentioned this earlier, but it deserves its own spotlight. The mobile version works **flawlessly**. You can place trades, withdraw earnings, and monitor markets on the go. No app needed—just log in from your phone browser.

This is perfect for anyone who trades casually or travels often.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up notifications for **price targets, market trends, or risk levels**. These alerts are super helpful for staying in control, especially if you're not glued to your screen 24/7. I found them accurate and timely—never spammy.

That said, always be cautious. Never invest money you can’t afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate +13X iQuix?

The platform requires a **$250 minimum deposit** to start trading. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this, but I wish they offered a lower entry point for people just testing the waters.

The good thing is that you can use the **demo mode** before depositing real money to see if it’s a good fit.

### Immediate +13X iQuix Customer Support

Support is available **24/7** via chat and email. I tested both, and the response time was solid—less than 10 minutes for chat, and under an hour for email.

## The Verdict

So, is Immediate +13X iQuix worth it?

Honestly, **yes—for most users, especially beginners**. It’s smart, responsive, and gives you solid tools without needing to be a Wall Street pro. The $250 deposit might be a barrier for some, and I’d love to see more transparency about the team behind it, but those are minor gripes in the grand scheme.

Finally, a normal (big?!) betting night. 🛎️☕️","**Holy hell, friends. As you know, the first half of April was stone cold** – I can't speak for anyone else, but it certainly was for me! To be honest, the first couple weeks of April are always a bit rough due to various factors: teams resting guys for playoffs, teams not caring because they're not going to be in the playoffs, starting pitchers still finding their stride... etc.

**That said, I had a cash cow betting day today.** For the last 3 months, these ""cash cow betting days"" have been a regular occurrence for me. But in April? It's the first time in 10 days, and I'm *thrilled*. But it's also prompting this post. If you're curious, get comfortable...

While there are plenty of reasons (as mentioned above) for April to be volatile, the *reason* for losses doesn't make them feel any less shitty. 😂 I do this for a living (and have been for quite some time now...) so a bad couple of weeks doesn't really phase my bankroll too much. I will say however, *it really does* wear one's patience down *thin*. I've been winning and cashing for months, and yet somehow 2 bad weeks still fucked up my mood. If I didn't post my picks publicly, this might not've been the case – but here we are ;)

**I'm being honest and candid about this for various reasons, but the biggest being this: cold streaks happen to everyone.**

If you're out there questioning your betting confidence, especially at this time of year – don't. Bad weeks (or hell, a bad month) happens to every bettor on the planet. Even the best.

A bad week doesn't make you not profitable. A bad month doesn't make you not profitable long-term. And it sure AF doesn't mean you're reading games wrong (well, perhaps sometimes... ha ha!) But early on in the season, it's always fun when two pitchers with a collective Earned Run Average of 20.0 decide to pitch the game of their lives when you're waiting on the Over to cash!

**But I digress.**

Over the last few months, I've noticed a number of new faces in this community, and I'm so grateful. ❤️🤩 I love sharing Pick of the Day, my Round Robins, and other fun wagers that I think we can all cash in on together.

**But hear this: I'm in this shit for the long haul, betting family.** If you're here to make a quick buck, that's cool – but if you're going to berate me when I go on bad run from time to time, promptly unfollow me. **On the other hand, if you're here to make your year substantially ""greener"", then hang around. And if you ever have questions about my picks or my process, I can't tell you how happy I am to assist. My door (DM inbox?) is quite literally always open.** 

I'm done rambling – but I figured *someone out there* might feel better reading this. Feel free to drop comments if you have thoughts or questions. **As for my cash cow betting night, here's how I did:**

1k1uipm,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1k1uipm/the_map_pin/,The map pin.,"So, baby…

There’s this cabin I know. Down south a-ways, tucked into the side of a mountain between the trees and the quiet. Not much to it, really — just enough.

A firepit out front for the crisp nights.  
A hot tub out back, perched on a balcony with a view of nothing but trees.  
Inside, it’s all flannel sheets and cozy corners.  
A classic arcade cabinet for rainy days — but no Paperboy, I’m afraid.  
And a tiny kitchen with a coffee pot and a fridge, for storing the essentials.

Like looooots of alcohol… (What? You thought I was gonna stop being *fun*? I said cut *back*, not cut *out*. And no, baby… I am never letting you live *that one* down… ever.)

I imagine sending you a map pin and a couple of dates. No context. Just: This is where I’ll be. If you feel like disappearing for a bit…

Meet me there.

We’d sit by the fire, letting the flames dance while we talked about everything… or nothing at all.  
One hand for holding, the other for swirling drinks.

One arm around you, if you’d let me. I’d keep you warm — you know I would.

And the hot tub…

We could let the jets work out the aches in our backs, your head resting on my chest, the water swirling around us…

Or… we could do whatever it is two people who are wildly into each other might do in a hot tub on the side of a mountain, in the woods, with no one else for miles around to see…

or hear…

And mornings would slip by slow, warm, lazy — staying cozy under those covers for as long as we pleased. Then we’d head out to the nearby state park — a place I visited many a childhood summer…

I’d show you the view from the natural bridge. You’d take all the nature photos you want…

I’d end up taking more of you, though.

Maybe one night we’d wander into the nearest town for dinner. Nothing too fancy. Not sure there’s anything fancy out there anyway — but that’s fine.

I’d be with you.

*   **iPad Model:** Do you have the latest iPad Pro with Thunderbolt capabilities, an iPad Air with USB-C, or an older iPad with a Lightning port (requiring a USB-C to USB adapter iPad combined with a hub)? This dictates the type of adapter and hub you’ll need.
*   **Connectivity Requirements:** What devices do you regularly connect? A keyboard and mouse are different from an external monitor, MIDI controller, or high-speed external storage device. Think about the number of USB ports, HDMI output, SD card reader, and audio jack you might need.
*   **Portability:** Do you need a supremely portable USB hub for iPad, or are you primarily using your iPad as a desktop replacement at home or in the office? The size and weight of the hub can become crucial if you're constantly on the go.
*   **Power Delivery:** Does your hub need to support USB hub for ipad with power delivery, allowing you to charge your iPad while together connecting other devices? This is crucial for extended use sessions when plugging in several power-hungry accessories.

1k1ubzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k1ubzb/im_sorry_sounds_fun_but_i_dont_know_you_aitah_for/,"I’m sorry, sounds fun but, I don’t know you? AITAH for being creeped out?","This may need a trigger warning but is not directly SA or Abuse. But it is trauma shit. 

I’m a young woman in my mid twenties. Unfortunately I am quite conventionally attractive (fit, curvy, petite, long hair, nice eyes, lips etc.) and I understand why many people want to fuck me. But I’m over it 🙃 

I’m a sensitive, intense and weird person. I want someone to love me for that. I’ve experienced too many times the feeling of being desired by someone, only to see their shock and horror when they find out I’m a real person, with real feelings and fucked up parts to my life that I want real human connection to be able to survive through. 

I’ve also experienced violent backlash by simply telling men no. Nothing has fucked up my life more than a man who is in love with an idea of what he can get from me, all the while deeply hating who I am. I’m not your manic pixie. 

Anyways. Yesterday i was working on my computer in a coffee shop. A man behind me was working at a table as well. When i got up to leave, he ran and stopped me at the door. I took my headphones off reluctantly. He said, “I noticed you, what is your name? Go on a date with me” 

That scenario is a common daydream I’ve had myself. I was flattered, kinda. But in my experience, its more fun in fantasy than reality. 

In reality, I felt violated. How long was I being watched? Was he going to be able to take a no? Could I come back to this coffee shop in the future or would this now be an issue?

On the one hand, I do admire his courage and I could give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he’s a great person. But in that moment, he’s a stranger. It was too direct and based off of my looks, or my “mysterious intrigue” which.. 🤮

“I don’t know anything about you to know if I would want to take the risk of possibly being stalked or killed or both” would have been the most honest answer I could have given him. But perhaps that’s too direct. In reality I said a reluctant, “sure” but I will not be following up. I don’t care too much if I’m shitty for that. It might be saving me my life. 

I’m a romantic myself. I want to believe there are good people out there and that spontaneous connections like that can happen and be great. That has not been my experience. Taking risks has gotten me hurt too consistently. 

I know Reddit is an incel infested dumpster fire, but it’s the only place I have at the moment to confide to the masses about these things. 

People of Reddit, is it reasonable to be creeped out by a stranger wanting a date? Without chatting me up or even giving me his name? Regardless, I’m not that impressed. ",2,1744943374.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1k1u5ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1u5ot/this_is_how_onlyfans_ruined_my_life/,This Is How OnlyFans Ruined My Life.,"The world felt like it was closing in, $40,000 in student loans suffocating me, instant ramen my only meal in a paper-thin apartment. The pandemic had gutted my barista job, leaving my bank account gasping at $12.37. That’s when the messages started. Random accounts, new ones every day, creeping into my DMs: “Start an OnlyFans. You’ll get rich. Trust me.”  

I thought they were bots, some creep’s sick game. But they kept coming, sharper, like they saw through me: “Start an OnlyFans. It’ll change your life. Or end it.” I don’t know why they hit so hard, maybe I was desperate, but when my landlord taped a third eviction notice to my door, I broke.  

I wasn’t careless. OnlyFans meant exposing myself, but I’d be smart. I created Avery, a version of me who was fearless, seductive, nothing like quiet Joce who stayed out of sight. I used filters, wigs, clever angles to keep my face hidden. My first post, a shadowy tease, got 50 subscribers overnight. By the week’s end, I had 200, and the tips were unreal. $500. $800. $1200. Every ping on my phone was a rush, like I was worth something. I paid rent, bought groceries, got a new phone. I was alive again.  

But the high dragged something dark with it. Comments turned greedy, less “you’re gorgeous,” more “give us everything.” If I didn’t cave, they got vicious: “You’re nothing without us.” I called them trolls, until I saw something worse. Subscribers started mentioning things they shouldn’t know: “Loved your red hoodie today, Joce.” “You looked stressed at the library.” I never shared my real life, never showed my face, but they knew.  
Then he showed up. Username: Collector_J. No profile pic, just a void. His first message was too calm: “You’re perfect, Evangeline. You don’t belong here.”  

My heart stopped. Evangeline wasn’t my name. Nobody, not even my old roommates, knew about OnlyFans. I blocked him, but the next day, another account: “You can’t hide, Evangeline. I see you.” I deleted it, locked down every setting, but the messages kept slipping through, like he was inside my phone: “You owe me, Evangeline. Come back.”  

Sleep became a ghost. My phone buzzed all night, notifications from strangers who knew my routine, what I wore, where I studied. My apartment felt like a cage, like eyes were pressing through the walls. One night, I woke to scratching at my window, fourth floor, no way up. I yanked the curtains shut, shaking, but in the morning, white lilies sat outside my door. The note read: “You looked terrified last night, Evangeline. I’m watching.”  

I didn’t delete OnlyFans then. I should’ve, but the money was my lifeline, and I thought I could tough it out. Then the video hit.  

I logged in to check my tips and saw a post I didn’t make. A blurry video, shot from above my bed, showing me sleeping. No wig, no filters, just Joce, laid bare. The caption: “Evangeline, unmasked. Mine.” Comments exploded: “We see you now.” “You’re ours.” My subscribers spiked to thousands overnight, but their profiles were blank, names just numbers, all chanting: “Come home, Evangeline.”  

I deleted OnlyFans that day, hands trembling so bad I could barely tap the screen. I erased Avery, changed my email, my number, my locks. It didn’t matter. Gifts started showing up: earrings I’d browsed online, a notebook I’d lost years ago, a photo of me at 16 from an angle I’d never seen, like someone was standing over me. Each had a note: “You’re mine, Evangeline.”  

Collector_J texted my new phone, one I hadn’t shared: “Look outside, Evangeline. She’s waiting.”  

I peeked through the blinds, heart hammering. Nothing was there, but when I turned back, my laptop was open, screen glowing. It showed a live feed of my apartment, my kitchen, me standing frozen. The angle was from my ceiling, but I don’t have a camera there. Text crawled across: “You can’t leave her, Evangeline.”  

I unplugged everything, smashed my webcam, moved to a new place across town. The messages followed, hitting my new phone, my new email: “You’re running out of places to hide.” Photos started coming, of me in my new apartment, making coffee, reading, sleeping. One was me in my bathroom, brushing my teeth, taken from inside the mirror. I taped a towel over it, but the next day, it was gone, and a note was stuck to the glass: “Evangeline sees you too.”  

I started seeing her. In reflections, not just mirrors, windows, my phone screen, even a spoon. A woman who looked like me but wasn’t. Her eyes were wrong, too old, too empty, like she’d seen something awful. I’d blink, and she’d be gone, but each time, I felt less like Joce. My dreams were worse. I’d wake up choking, trapped in a house I’d never seen, her voice calling me Evangeline, hands dragging me into darkness.  

Last week, I found a Polaroid in my mailbox. A woman who could’ve been my twin, same jaw, same hair, but dressed in clothes from the 60s. On the back, in faded ink: “Evangeline, 1963.” My phone buzzed right after, a text from Collector_J: “She was sold too, Evangeline. Betrayed by her pictures. Check your closet.”  

I didn’t want to, but my legs moved on their own. I opened the closet, and there was a mirror I’d never seen, full-length, edges cracked. My reflection wasn’t me. It was her, Evangeline, smiling, her eyes locked on mine. She raised a hand, pressed it against the glass, and whispered my name, Jocelyn, like she knew me. I stumbled back, but the mirror kept showing her, even when I turned away.  

I smashed it, broke it into a hundred pieces, but every shard still showed her face. My phone buzzed, a video from an unknown number. It was me, smashing the mirror, but from an angle inside the closet, like someone was right behind me. The text: “You’re almost hers, Evangeline.”  

I don’t know who Collector_J is, or why he’s doing this. I don’t know why Evangeline’s eyes are starting to look like mine.

So, there I was, scrolling through rabbit holes of stress-reduction tips on a late Tuesday night (we've all been there, right?), when I stumbled upon a science-backed breathing technique. The promise? *Instant calm and focus*. Yeah, right, I thought. But hey, I'm a sucker for anything that doesn’t require a 5 a.m. wake-up call or an hour-long yoga session.

And here we are. I gave it a whirl every morning for a week. Here’s how it went:

- **What is it?**
  - Imagine this: just 2 minutes of simple, focused breathing. The technique is called **box breathing**, and it’s used by Navy SEALs (if it can calm them down, surely it'll work for us, mere mortals?).
  - **How it works:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold the breath out for 4. *Rinse and repeat.*

- **Day 1:** Honestly, I felt a bit silly and borderline skeptical. But the constant mental checklist and ‘did-I-feed-the-cat?' worries seemed slightly quieter. 😬

- **Day 3:** Definitely noticed less morning grogginess. Like that mental fog was lifted just a tad. Hello, productivity!

- **Day 5:** I started feeling...calmer. Like, genuinely less like a pinball bouncing against all sides of my To-Do list. Who knew slowing down could make time feel more manageable?

- **How does this work?** 
  - A quick dive into the science: **Cortisol**, the 'stress hormone’, drops when your body gets these clear signals to chill. Plus, this technique helps increase clarity and focus. 🤓 Makes sense, right? We breathe all day but rarely focus on making each breath count.

- **So, is it magic?**  
  - Not exactly. But it *is* surprisingly powerful. This tiny practice reminded me of how my body holds onto stress and how a few mindful moments can change the day’s trajectory.

Now it’s your turn, *MaximizeMe* warriors. Have you tried this or similar hacks that seemed too simple to be effective? How do you fit mindfulness into your chaotic routine? Let’s swap stories and tips! 🍃",1,1744942639.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I got to know this one guy from the library and we started to hang out a lot (almost everyday). I told him a lot about my past struggles (like family issues, bullying in school etc) and he was a good listener.

He eventually brought me to his church and I met some nice people there. Over time, I got to learn his behaviour even more and I realized he wasn't so nice. His brother tried telling me how good Donald J Trump is and how I should see what he's actually doing for the people etc. Turns out the guy I met from the library is also a trump supporter and was subtly trying to make me become a DJT supporter as well (saying all kinds of things about him and how the media just likes to make him look bad).

I made it clear I wasn't a supporter of his and when asked why is it because your dad is a democrat I said ""yes, partly but not entirely"" and he asked me to give him a percentage of how much influence my dad has over me and I said I wasn't going to quantify that. This turned into an argument the next day when I said I didn't appreciate how he boxed me into the convo about politics and made assumptions and asked for an apology.

Not only did he refuse the apology, failed to take accountability for it by projecting onto me. He said we should meet in person to discuss this because he doesn't like texting. We met up and I bought him a Starbucks coffee and we sat on a sofa. I got belittled, told I'm trying to bring him down to my level by asking for an apology, have no confidence and low self-esteem etc. He even said the stuff I was saying is what the devil says and said he wants to pray with me to which I refused. He told me to get up and hug him to which I refused but I extended my hand (prior to this he said he wanted to say a prayer with me and I said this wasn't about religion and if he wanted to pray to do it in his own time). He mentioned over text how the friendship was over prior to the meeting. Few days go by and his brother deletes me off social media out of the blue.

I stopped seeing him and his friends along with the church people. But now I'm certain he's been ruining my rep behind my back and when he sees me he always tries to give me a fist bump saying ""what's up bro"". I always reciprocate because I dont want to show weakness since he knows about my bullying past.

Last time I texted him was late January and I basically just keep telling his friend im busy when his friend asks me to ""let me know when you're at school and we'll chop it up :) "". AITA ?",1,1744942465.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1k1tz0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1k1tz0s/county_fence_biannual_magazine_part_8_inquiring/,"[County Fence Bi-Annual Magazine] - Part 8 - Inquiring The Way Of Jules Octavian - By Gregaro McKool, Literary Editor","The laneway is narrow, a little rough and worn. It leads into a tidy mixed forest of maple, birch, and the odd pine. Mature, healthy, second growth forest minimally tended over generations by expert hands. Something you’d only notice if you were looking for it, and even then maybe not. It’s authenticity-plus, as if experiencing the forest without mosquitoes through an expert photographer’s lens.

The road that leads to the laneway is quiet, the rough kind that might have once been busy but now just fades into oblivion. In other words, there’s very little traffic. What goes on down that laneway the locals have no idea. Usually a gossipy bunch with little to talk about aside from minute changes to the surrounding environment they have absolutely no interest in this particular laneway, it’s as if it doesn’t exist. It’s been here since the beginning, predating most of them, and it blends into the scenery like books on a shelf in the background. Sure you could go grab one and read it, but you’d have to notice first.

Speaking of books, that’s how you used to find your way here. The location has never been a secret and many people do seek it out but you have to be looking to notice it. Before the internet you’d look up one address in a book, send a letter requesting the address to this place, and await further instructions. Of course the internet has streamlined the whole process: now you simply look it up on the kind of website most people would never think to visit on a page most people never bother to look at. The path is clear but otherwise there are no clues to what exists down that laneway and that’s the way they like it.

If you are one of these odd individuals who make this pilgrimage you would find an introvert’s paradise built by people who see more than is likely there in pursuit of discerning patterns from the chaos. The kind of people willing to make sacrifices and work hard for something that may never come to fruition. The kind of people who believe they can and should come together for the greater good but are usually better off working alone. The kind of people who quietly build elaborate fantasies in hopes that one day they may become the reality.

Thus the property is pedantically well-designed with every detail thoroughly fussed over and having gone through countless iterations. Inspiring winding paths link cozy houses full of perfect reading nooks to excellent coffee shops and artisanal workshops designed specifically for mental cross-training. Every walk is contemplative and rapid transit is achieved by bicycle. Or so that’s what I hear, there are strict rules for entry to ensure the hard work is not spoiled.

The fence isn’t visible from the road, that would draw too much attention. You won’t see the fortifications until a few kilometres down the laneway. Ancient, some going back to Gutenberg’s time. There’s rumours of the founders being calligraphillic monks cloistering themselves away to focus on the illumination of manuscripts but those were the earliest days, perhaps in service of a different god. As one might expect the advent of the internet has made the place much more accessible which has resulted in a recent modernization of the ancient fortifications. Tall, chain link, electrified, and topped with razor wire winding its way through ancient stone and earth embankments. That said, it’s more bark than bite with intentional perforations designed to test anyone who thinks themselves worthy enough to enter through unconventional routes while making it easier and more interesting for the residents to come and go. Newcomers are celebrated rather than punished for their ingenuity should they find their way in through a back door.

A gatehouse guards the conventional route and outside is a vast camp of people desperately hoping to gain entry. In a way it’s a refugee camp for people who would rather live in a fantasy than a reality. Outcasts and oddballs sufficiently convinced that the life inside is sufficiently better than the one they’re leading that they’re willing to suffer for entry. To live lean lives of hard work just for a chance to plead their case. They know the odds are against them but this is compulsion: there is no life but this one.

Today I stand among them. It’s a place I’ve dreamed about for a very long time, perhaps my oldest dream, but now I question it. What on the other side could be so good as to justify this? The wait can be years, there’s only so much space and money’s tight these days. And of course they want to protect what has so carefully been built over the years.

To one side of the camp there are those for whom entry was a lower priority, those who have lived lives and built security before launching their campaign for entry. RV’s, tiny homes, sumptuous prospector tents. It’s certainly rougher than what they left back home yet they could live out their lives here and likely be happy enough for the adventure.

On the other side are those for whom this is the only priority, those who put all their eggs in this basket and set forth on their journey penniless. Makeshift shelters, some quite elaborate, and tents. Some have opted to simply sleep under the stars or in hammocks.

There are those who have done well on the outside, a few who may have even given up trying to get in and instead make their way by teaching tips and tricks on how to get in. Nobody really takes them seriously but they’re a good way to pass the time if you’ve got a few bucks to toss their way. A few of them actually have good advice but generally the ones who know are already inside.

Of course there’s the weekend warriors too, those willing to come hang around when they have time and the mood strikes. I find them the easiest to talk to: they’ve got time and the stakes are low. The passion is there but they’ve also got families or other commitments to think about. They show up and wander around, just happy to be included. Maybe they’ll end up chatting to the right person who will let them in. They know it’s a long shot but a walk in these particular woods is a Saturday well-spent regardless of the outcome.

Today I’m not here with my application, I’m here on behalf of Jules Octavian who tells me they have a rather interesting fence I might like to profile. Indeed: he’s right. The whole thing is fascinating and so far I can only speculate on what’s inside. In a way it’s a pilgrimage I’ve always wanted to take. While it’s a place I’ve dreamed of living my entire life I never assumed it was even possible, just seeing the gate would have been good enough for me a decade ago. And yet here it is: this place I’ve always dreamed of, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and a strange encampment. Application? No, no, I’m here for County Fence Bi-Annual. Yes, that’s right. Jules Octavian, yes. Just here for the fence. Fantastic, thanks so much.

Like so many of these people I did write an application, several in fact, but most of them were never finished for some reason or other. Mostly because I couldn’t articulate *why* I should be there, just that I wanted to be. That said, standing here I wonder if it’s what I do actually want. I almost feel like I’m more in love with the rollicking mid-century version of this place. There were certainly issues with it back then, mostly to do with it being an old-boys club. There were a lot fewer fortifications then but if you didn’t want to talk bull fighting or your latest acid trip you weren’t exactly ‘in.’ I love the absurdity and experimentation of those days, I just wish there was a little less toxic masculinity. These days it almost seems like the pendulum has swung the other way and they’re circling the wagons to embark on something completely different. Supposedly most men aren’t even interested in this place anymore. But standing here, I don’t know. Do I really want to live in a place with such high and imposing fences? Might I feel hemmed in rather than free to roam?

The problem is I didn’t think they’d like my application, but I did. I don’t know that, of course. I’d only find out if I brought it here and waited for at least six months, probably a year or two, if I got a call-back at all. And that’s only the first stage: the first reviewers have to then make a case to a higher body which may take a couple more years. I could take this huge document about why I think I’d be a good resident and tie it up for years or I could use it as a blueprint to build a place of my own. Yet that’s risky too: have I got the ability or am I just going to piss away a couple of years of hard work? It feels like the same risk either way.

In the end it’s a confidence game, something I’ve never had a lot of. But the way to overcome my lack of confidence is to go off and build something on my own, to prove it rather than trying to impress potentially insecure strangers. That way it’s clear: I either do it or I don’t. There’s no speculation as to whether I can: it happens or it doesn’t. Done. I don’t have to believe in myself. I either finish the project or I quit. It’s just tough to know when to quit. It sure would be nice if someone in an authority position would tell me whether I’ve got the chops, wouldn’t it?

The thing I love about Jules Octavian is that he wouldn’t care. He’s never been interested in whether someone else says you can do something or not, he only cares about whether Jules Octavian thinks he can do something. Of course he’s got a family distillation patent and a couple of generations of wise-investing behind him. In other words, he can afford to fail. He’s got options, security. But I guess I do too, since I moved out here where the land was cheap, anyway. Perhaps I can simply fake it till I make it.

Still, from time to time I do wonder how I’d do with something more conventional, something more marketable. For example, I’m working on a pitch to The CBC right now with a friend of mine. It’s a traditional Canadian small-town comedy ripe to explore all the progressive themes we want to hear from our national broadcaster.

The CBC is interesting because to me, a once-enthusiastic outsider who has found other interests the past few years, it seems like they have to play it safe these days. They certainly don’t seem like the kind of people to invest in the literary editor of a regional fencing publication. Yet they produced one of my favourite shows of all time: *The Neddeaus of Duqesne Island.* It poses as a found-footage documentary of an isolated Northern Ontario family in the early 1970’s and does it so well that I had to keep the Wikipedia page open to assure myself it was in fact a mockumentary. So perhaps they do have space for the weird literary editor of Eastern Ontario’s oldest and most prestigious boundary and fencing publication. That said, they did reject my submission to their annual short story contest in favour of a memoir about a woman’s mother’s illness. I guess they didn’t want a Stuart MacLean-Margaret Atwood fan-fiction about how we should stop considering ourselves second fiddle to a country without socialized healthcare and rampant systemic racial inequality. To each their own, I suppose. At the end of the day all you can do is put yourself out there.

-After we got our badge and card we went to the showcase room where the lady showed us some of the uniforms and first class items and some items united has, then we met up with the people who went up before us and were able to get some water and snack or coffee :) 
-Then we watched a video, met the recruiters, and did our first activity. 
-After, we got a break where we could go to our bags and touch up or check phone or use bathroom, get snacks etc. 
-Once that was over we did our second group activity, and while some did the second activity others did the reach test and tattoo policy form.

Something Strange Is Happening Around My Tower,"I wont give my name for the sake of my job, but I will say I’m a 32 year old man working in Appalachia. It was around June so it was warm and super humid outside. I had been in the lookout for about a week already and all I really did was check in and keep watch. It was about eleven PM and I called the crew chief to clock in my last check in for the day. He asked me if I ran into anything today and I just told him no. He copied and I walked back to my desk to dive back into the book I had been reading. I sat down for not even five minutes when a bright flash engulfed the north side of my towers windows. I nearly fell out of my chair trying to jump to my feet. I stood there in disbelief not knowing if it was some rouge lightning bolt or a UFO. I looked out the windows and stared into pure darkness. I could see nothing but the dark forest silhouette underneath the bright moon light. I looked for about Three minutes and saw nothing. 

I got onto the radio and made a call to Three Tower who was my closest neighbor. He picked up the radio and asked what was wrong. I asked if he had seen a bright flash in the north and he said he hadn't. I told him it must have been my imagination and he ten foured me on. Just as I sat the radio down I began to hear what sounded like a low humming noise. I opened the door and waked out into the moon light. The humming stopped as soon as I steeped outside. I walked around the perimeter of the tower and found nothing. I made my way back to the door scratching my head at what was happening. I went inside and locked the door preparing myself for sleep. I kicked off my boots and hopped into bed melting my day away. 

When I woke up the next morning I made my coffee and began my morning readings. I opened the tower door and stepped out into the beautiful morning. The fog was thick and I couldn't really see anything on the ground. I leaned against the railing and sipped my coffee as I took in the morning air. I spun around to go back inside and that's when I noticed it. A hand print on the door window. The only reason I noticed it is because it was almost printed into the door with what looked like black soot, almost like charcoal or something like that. I panicked a little and radioed Three Tower again and let him know about my finding. He said I must have done it by accident or it was there and I didn't notice it before. I reluctantly agreed with him and signed out. 

The day went by as usual with nothing going on at all. I radioed in my last check in at eleven PM and I waited. My plan tonight was to pretend to be asleep and see if I could catch anything. I sat up for a couple hours fighting the urge to drift off into dream land when all of a sudden thunderous footsteps began to sprint up the stairs leading up my tower. I rolled off of my bed and crawled under the bed. The sprinting continued until they were one flight of stairs away from the top of the tower. The sprinting slowed to an almost predator like creeping, Footsteps to heavy to hide. They finally hit the top of the stairs but to my amazement, nothing was there. 

The creeping continued along the outside of the tower until they reached the door. My heart was in my throat and I was almost certain I was dying. Nothing happened after that. A deafening silence broke throughout the forest. Not a cricket was fiddling nor a owl was hooting. I Fell asleep under my bed and woke up to another beautiful morning. I tried to tell my boss but they simply don't believe me, blaming the solitude on my ""nightmares"".

It’s actually me Emogirlee (Eugenias #1 fan)
I see there are a lot of people pretending to be this or that so I’ll actually post proof if you guys want (like a vid or pic saying hi).

There was a post about me a while ago but I just got approved yesterday so here I am.

I’ll try to respond to every point people made about me.

I “copy” her hair style - I’ve done the classic emo swoop since high school and have shown pictures on my lives to prove it.

I “Copy” her outfits - I’ve only bought 2 outfits she’s used, the Miku one and the Black Santa one. Those were the only ones I liked and thought could look good in. Both of those were in outfit haul videos that she’s done on YouTube. That is the whole point of outfit haul videos, to show off the outfit and tell people were they can get them. Would you say literally everyone that bought those outfits are copying her??

My voice is like hers - I identify as a trans female and try to talk in a higher pitch so I sound more feminine and have been doing so for 10+ years. (does it work?? Debatable)

I copy her makeup - This one I’ll kinda agree with but it’s really just the eyeliner. I’m not even trying to copy her. I’ve been trying to get better at makeup and she’s the only makeup person I really follow, so it’s not surprising that mine comes out similar.

I only like her posts and nothing else - I don’t really watch anything on TikTok except for her so yea, the only posts I like are hers because she’s literally the only thing I watch.

I only like comments on my videos that mention Eugenia - 100% false. Easy to prove and idk where this idea came from.

Was asking for diet tips on live - again 100% false. One time I did talk about my work running out of the pink and yellow packets of artificial sweetener for my coffee in the morning and I had to use the new green one (witch I hate) I was talking bout how the blue one causes cancer and the pink one taste the best but the yellow one has the least amount of ingredients and that was it. Never asked for “tips”

I love Eugenia, she is amazing and wonderful. I look up to her and think she’s hella cool. You don’t have to agree with me but that’s how I feel.

I’ll answer any other questions you guys have  (as long as your respectful) but really I’m just a big fan of Eugenia but I’m trying to do my own thing on TikTok.

1k1tvdt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1tvdt,Home,"In a cozy little home, there lived a mischievous dog named Max. Max was a spirited little guy, always ready for an adventure. His best friend? His owner, Sarah, who loved him like family. They had a routine – walks in the park, belly rubs, and of course, the occasional snack time.

One evening, Sarah was relaxing on the couch, enjoying a freshly peeled orange. She set the slices down on the coffee table and turned her attention to the TV. Unbeknownst to her, Max, ever so curious, noticed the bright orange slices sitting there. His nose twitched, and his eyes lit up.

Without missing a beat, Max hopped off the couch and made a beeline for the orange slices. With all the stealth of a little ninja, he sneaked up to the table, his tail wagging furiously. As he reached the table, he didn't hesitate – he grabbed a slice and ran off, proudly munching on his unexpected treat.

Sarah, realizing what had happened, couldn’t help but laugh. Max had always been good at getting into things he wasn’t supposed to, but this? This was a new level of cheekiness. She could hardly stay mad at him, especially with his adorably guilty face as he chewed his prize.

""Well, I guess you have a taste for oranges now,"" Sarah chuckled, reaching down to give Max a belly rub.

From that day on, whenever Sarah peeled an orange, Max would sit by her side, watching intently, waiting for his turn. They shared many more orange slices, but Sarah made sure to keep some for herself—after all, they had to leave a few for the humans, too!

And so, their quirky little moments continued, filled with love, laughter, and the occasional sneaky snack. Max had his own way of making everyday moments unforgettable, and Sarah wouldn’t have it any other way.",1,1744941877.0,3Dpetart,0,1.0,False

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! Twenty-two campers arrived and learned that they'll be spending the next eight weeks at a crusty old summer camp.""

""The campers were faced with their first challenge: jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters! And while most campers took the plunge, a few were forced to wear the dreaded chicken hat.”

""At the Campfire Ceremony, it all came down to two campers. Courtney has experience as a CIT in summer camp, but refused to jump. And Mike managed to weird everybody out with his characters. In the end, the first camper voted off Total Drama Island was Courtney, proving that counselors and reality TV don't mix.""

""Who will be voted off this week, in the most dramatic Campfire Ceremony yet? Find out tonight, on Total! Drama! Island!""

(Theme Song)

Chris approaches the cabins with a megaphone in hand. He lifted the megaphone, and then an air horn. He blew the horn into the megaphone, and the noise rang out loud.

Lightning woke up and hit his head on the top bunk. ""Man, it's seven in the morning!"" he angrily exclaimed before looking out the window. ""Lightning needs his sleep!""

The campers were now outside. Eva and Rodney were focused on together. Eva was listening to music on her MP3 player, and Rodney peeked at her, but a growl from the muscle woman made him think again. Suddenly, a romantic tune played as Rodney looked at Eva with hearts surrounding her.

Confessional: Rodney

""On the farm, it's just me, my dad, and my five little brothers,"" Rodney explained. ""I've never had a mom, but I wish I did so I could get advice on girls.""

Confessional Ends

""Morning!"" Chris addressed the tired campers. ""Hope you slept well.""

""Hi, Chris. You look really buff in those shorts,"" Heather said.

""I know,"" Chris said. ""Okay. I hope you're all ready, because your next challenge begins in exactly one minute.""

""Oh, excuse me!"" Owen shouted out. ""I don't know if that's enough time to eat breakfast.""

""Oh, you'll get breakfast, Owen. Right after you complete your twenty kilometer run around the lake!"" Chris emphasized.

""Oh, so you're funny now?"" Eva asked warningly as she raised her fist and moved closer to the host. ""You know what I think would be funny?""

Duncan and Mike moved in to restrain her from doing any damage. ""Eva, please try to control your temper,"" Ella whispered to Eva.

Eva turned to Chris. ""You're enjoying this, aren't you?!""

""A little. You have thirty seconds,"" Chris announced as Eva twitched her eye.

Confessional: Ella

""Eva hasn't been great at handling her emotions,"" Ella sighed. ""We've only been here for a week and she's thrown her suitcase out a window and broken the lock on one of the bathroom doors.""

Confessional Ends

The campers were lined up. ""Okay runners!"" Chris called. ""On your marks! Get set! GO!"" The campers took off.

The scene skipped ahead to the middle of the race. Shawn, Lindsay, Sky, Lightning, Eva, and Beth were running in the lead while Sadie, Katie, Harold, and Dawn were walking behind them.

""Do you know how much longer?"" Harold asked Dawn while Brick and Ella got past them.

""I suppose not,"" Dawn replied.

The camera panned over to Noah running past Heather and bumping into her shoulder, much to the queen bee's irritation. ""Do you mind?""

Confessional: Heather

""I don't run. And I definitely don't run in high heel wedges,"" Heather clarified.

Confessional Ends

Heather came up to Owen, who was on the ground and out of breath.

""Can't... catch... breath. Must... have... condition!"" Owen panted while drinking water from the floor.

""Yeah. It's called overeating. Look into it,"" Heather sassily mocked the big guy.

Chris appeared on camera riding a scooter and holding a megaphone. ""Pick it up, people!"" he shouted as he rode past the walkers and runners. ""If you're not back by dinnertime, you don't eat!""

""I hate him so much!"" Heather grumbled before walking, stepping on Owen in the process.

The scene cut to the Mess Hall. Most of the campers had made it and finished running, and Chris was filing his nails.

The main door was flung open by Owen holding a passed out Noah over him. ""Clear a table! Stat!""

Owen placed Noah onto an empty table and pumped his chest in order to wake him up.

""Where have you been?"" Rodney asked Harold when the latter arrived and tried catching his breath. ""We just lost the challenge!""

Harold inhaled heavily. ""I think I'm having heart palpitations.""

""Hold on. If they lost the challenge... that means we won!"" Sky realized, and the Gophers began to cheer, even Noah, who had recovered from unconsciousness.

""Whoa there. Hold your horses, guys!"" Chris interrupted. ""That wasn't the challenge!""

""Say what?"" Lightning said immediately.

Chris walked towards some purple curtains that were drawn back. ""Who's hungry?"" he asked as a buffet was presented.

Confessional: Noah

""After eating brown sludge for a week,"" Noah said, ""I was at the brink of tears when I saw that buffet.""

Confessional: Owen

""And then I saw it, the buffet table. It was beautiful. There was turkey and Nanamo bars and baked beans and maple syrup!"" Owen started to choke up. ""Can I have a minute?"" He began to cry.

Confessionals End

A few minutes later, the food was devoured, and everyone was stuffed from eating.

Chris hopped on to the table with his megaphone. ""Okay campers! Time for part two of your challenge!""

""I thought eating was the second part,"" Owen said.

""What more do you want from us?"" Noah groaned.

""Haven't we been through enough?"" Heather added.

""Too bad,"" Chris answered. ""It's time for..."" he announced, ""the Awake-a-Thon!""

""The What-a-Thon?"" Owen asked.

""Don't worry!"" Chris answered, hopping down to the floor. ""This is an easy one! The team with the last camper standing wins invincibility!""

""So the twenty-kilometer run and the turkey buffet was meant to make it harder for us to stay awake?"" Noah asked.

""That's right, Noah!"" Chris answered.

""I should have seen this coming,"" Noah moaned.

""Move! Move! Move!"" Chris said into his megaphone, and the campers headed out the door.

""How long do you think it'll be before everyone's out cold?"" Brick asked Dawn as the others filed past them.

""I'd say an hour,"" Dawn told the cadet, ""but if anyone ate too much turkey, I'll say less.""

The scene cut to the campers at the campfire pit, and twelve hours have passed since the challenge started.

""We are now twelve hours in,"" Chris narrated, ""with all twenty-one campers still wide awake.""

""Woohoo! Stay awake for twelve hours?! I can do that in my sleep! Woohoo!"" Owen whooped before feeling woozy. He stumbled backwards and after his head hit the ground, he fell asleep, sending the Gophers' score from 11 to 10.

Confessional: Brick

""The Awake-a-thon is something that I'm not at all in the slightest bothered by,"" Brick stated. “I've been able to stay awake for long periods of time back at cadets.”

Confessional Ends

The camera cut back to the challenge, focusing on Brick and Dawn sitting together. ""This is going to take long,"" Dawn said.

""Though it could be worse,"" Brick challenged.

""How?"" Dawn asked.

""I would have no one to talk to,"" Brick revealed, and it caused Dawn to smile a bit.

The camera panned over to Heather, who was observing her surroundings with a raised eyebrow.

Confessional: Heather

""So my strategy is to get two other campers to form an alliance with me and take to the Final Three,"" Heather explained. ""The only question is, who can I find that is either desperate or dumb enough to do whatever I say?”

Confessional Ends

Lindsay was shown standing on her head. ""What are you doing?"" Noah asked from off-screen.

""Trying to get the blood to rush to my head,"" Lindsay answered. ""I think it's working!""

Beth walked up to Lindsay. ""Can I try?""

""Sure!"" Lindsay encouraged.

The camera cut to a smirking Heather. ""Perfect. Lindsay, Beth, can I talk to you for a sec?""

“Sure!” Lindsay accepted, both girls standing on their heads.

The shot flash-transitioned to a close-up of Heather. ""Okay,"" she began. ""I have a plan to get me and two other people in the Final Three, and I chose you guys.""

""Really?"" Lindsay smiled at her.

""You should know that this is a very big deal. I am placing my trust in you, and trust is a two-way street,"" Heather told the girls, who both nodded enthusiastically. ""So you'll do everything I say then?""

""Sure,"" Lindsay agreed and turned to Beth. ""We're going to the Final Three!” She then squealed loudly, disturbing Heather.

Confessional: Beth

""Oh! My! Gosh! Heather is taking me to the Final Three! I'm going to the Final Three, I'm going to the Final Three!"" Beth paused her squealing and gave the confession cam a questioning look. ""I wonder what will happen then?""

Confessional Ends

""Speaking of alliances, you know who I think is really cute?"" Lindsay said with a look towards Ezekiel, who was sitting on a tree stump.

Heather blocks her view of him. ""Oh no. No no no. You can't date him.""

""Why not?"" Lindsay wondered.

""Because he's on the other team,"" Heather explained.

""Uh-huh?"" Lindsay didn't understand.

""You can't interteam date. It's like... against the alliance rules,"" Heather continued.

""There are rules?"" Lindsay asked.

Heather stomped up to them and leaned over them. ""Remember what I just said about trust, Lindsay? Of course, you could always leave the alliance. If you do though, I can't protect you from getting kicked off.""

""No. I want to be in the alliance,"" Lindsay stuttered.

""Good. Then it's settled,"" Heather said satisfyingly and walked off, Beth following behind her.

Ezekiel saw Lindsay and waved, making the blonde smile at him.

Confessional: Lindsay

“Heather said I couldn't date him,” Lindsay recalled. “She never said I couldn't like him.”

Confessional Ends

Eva stood up and put her MP3 player in her pocket. ""I'm going to the bathroom.""

Heather looked at her from the corner of her eye and saw Eva's MP3 player fall out of her pocket. Smirking, she got up, looked around, and walked to where the MP3 player fell. She then did some stretches and picked up the MP3.

Beth saw Heather come back to her seat. ""Isn't that Eva's MP3 player?""

""Yep,"" Heather confirmed with the device in her hands.

""Won't she get really mad when she finds out it's gone?"" Beth asked.

""That's exactly what I'm counting on.” The camera zoomed in on Heather's smirking face.

(Commercial Break)

It has now been twenty-four hours since the challenge started. Ella was sleeping with Mike barely holding on. Jo and Noah had dozed off as well. Lightning was also sleeping, leaving the score Gophers - 7, Bass - 7 since Katie and Sadie were also asleep.

""Congratulations, campers!"" Chris announced. ""You've made it to the twenty-four hour mark! Time to take things up a notch!"" The shot zoomed out to reveal that the host was standing next to a large object covered in a sheet, and Chef came over dressed in a pink sheep costume while holding a small harp. ""Fairy tales!"" Chris pulled out the sheet to reveal a pile of books.

""Seriously?!"" Shawn remarked.

Chris cleared his throat, and Chef began to strum. ""Once...upon a time..."" Chris began slowly. ""There was...inside this boring kingdom..."" Beth was shown yawning. ""...a boring village. And inside this boring, sleepy, village...filled with, very boring children..."" Mike was shown trying not to fall asleep along with Cody who was leaning against an unknown source.

As the geek began to close his eyes, the scene cut to a lone harp. Two small pink sheep jumped over the harp, but the next one to jump was the costumed Chef. As soon as he jumped, the sound of a fart was played, and the scene cut back to reveal that Cody was sleeping against Owen's butt. He woke up to Owen's gas and coughed for a while.

'The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy' began to play. Chef, now in a ballerina's tutu, jumped and spread glitter around. First was Duncan, Eva, and Mike getting showered in glitter and immediately yawning. Cody and Lightning got hit next, and they yawned as well.

Rodney was shown tying himself to a tree, but he got hit by Chef's fairy dust and began to yawn. He quickly fell asleep, and his weight caused the tree to fall over. It was now Gophers - 6, Bass - 6.

The challenge was at the forty hour mark, and the remaining campers were trying to stay awake.

Confessional: Sky

""As much as I would love to throw in the towel right now, I'm not giving in,"" Sky commented. ""That would be a weak move, and if I win the challenge today, it'll secure me as a valuable asset.”

Confessional Ends

The scene switched to show Duncan, Eva, Ezekiel, Mike, and Shawn remaining for the Bass, and Beth, Brick, Dawn, Heather, Lindsay, and Sky remaining for the Gophers. The score was now Gophers - 6, Bass - 5.

""We should talk about our strategy,"" Heather nudged Lindsay, who snored and fell back before going to sleep.

""Beth?"" Heather checked on the wannabe, who was also asleep. The Gophers’ score went from 6 to 4.

Currently, Brick and Dawn were engaged in a conversation. ""Back in cadets, I took the teamwork medal three years running!"" Brick prided. “Also, the bed-making medal, the ""flag-folding"" medal, and the letters-home-to-mom medal. I always win that one.”

""I'm proud of your achievements,"" Dawn smiled. ""But you don't have to put yourself out there as much just because you were teased a lot as a child.""

""What? Who told you that?"" Brick grew nervous.

""It's right there in your aura,"" Dawn continued. ""Between your bladder control issues and your need to be dominated.”

“I don't need to be dominated. I'm large and in charge!” Brick denied her claim.

""You do make an excellent leader if you want my personal opinion,"" Dawn smiled.

They were then interrupted by Owen, who was sleepwalking naked. Dawn and Brick looked at him and his discarded clothes, and both were mortified.

Confessional: Owen

""Did I mention that I ate the entire dish of baked beans and maple syrup?"" Owen claimed. ""Funny thing about baked beans, they make me sleepwalk.""

Confessional Ends

The scene cut to Sadie and Katie asleep on the floor. They both snored, but in their own different ways.

Dawn and Brick looked at the sight. ""They even fall asleep together,"" Brick observed.

Brick and Dawn were now looking at the sky. ""Are you still awake?"" Dawn checked up on the cadet.

""Yes,"" Brick confirmed. ""I know about the Crucible, and I can tell you that it's miles better than what we're doing right now.""

""That one only takes 54 hours,"" Dawn said.

""Do you know where the Little Dipper is?"" Brick asked.

""See the Big Dipper?"" Dawn pointed at the sky. ""Follow the handle to that bright star, the pole star, and there it is. I usually observe the sky when I'm outdoors, and it's given me more information about when the stars come specifically.""

""That's nice,"" Brick smiled.

Meanwhile, a sleepwalking Owen had reached the cliff. Just when it seemed that Owen would fall off, he stopped himself, turned around, and fell off backwards. A splash was heard below.

The scene flashed ahead to the fifty-one hour mark. Over on the Killer Bass, Ezekiel and an overly alert Shawn were sitting together. ""Are you okay?"" Ezekiel asked out of idle curiosity.

""Of course!"" Shawn replied immediately, his eyes darting around. ""Just gotta stay alert and on-guard if I have to stay on the ground tonight. Never know when a zombie might lurch out of the darkness!""

""I'm pretty sure that won't happen,"" Ezekiel said. ""I don't know why we lost last time, eh,"" he continued. ""They're the ones that had more girls on the team.""

""What do you mean by that?"" Shawn got curious.

“Well, guys are much stronger and better at sports than girls are,” Ezekiel claimed. “They're also smarter as well.”

Shawn facepalmed. “Zeke, you've got this so wrong. Who even told you this?”

“Well, my dad did,” Ezekiel admitted. “He told me to look out for the girls here and help them in case they can't keep up.”

“I hate to burst your bubble, but we're not in the fifties anymore,” Shawn told the homeschooler. “And some of the guys here are kinda weak themselves.”

“Oh,” Ezekiel said with regret. “I guess I was wrong.”

“No, your parents are,” Shawn consoled him. “You should know more about the outside world since you've been sheltered most of your life, and I'm gonna help you… after the challenge is over.”

Ezekiel watched as Shawn rolled around the clearing and disappeared behind a tree stump, much to his confusion.

The scene cut back to Owen, who was swimming up the river with fishes. While he did so, eighty-five hours had passed, and the sun rose up on the campers.

Harold was still sleeping, and Duncan, who had woken up, carried a bowl of hot water and placed Harold's hand into it.

""Gross, it works! Dude peed his pants!"" Duncan laughed.

Harold woke up, and he saw the pee stain on his pants, forcing him to cover it up.

Meanwhile, Sadie and Katie have woken up at the same time. Noah and Cody were starting to wake up, but Noah was kissing something. Once he realized that he was kissing Cody's ear, he screamed in terror. Cody followed suit, and they ran in opposite directions.

The remaining Bass, Duncan, Eva, and Shawn, were still wide awake, but they were getting more tired. ""Oh man, this is starting to get to me!"" Shawn said.

""What is the matter with you people?"" Chris said with coffee in hand and he took a sip. ""Come on! Fall asleep already!""

""Can we just have one sip?"" Sky begged. ""I'll even eat the grinds!""

Chris continued. ""Alright. You six stay with me."" The last six, Brick, Dawn, Duncan, Eva, Shawn, and Sky, approached the host. ""The rest of you, go and get a shower for heaven's sake! You stink!""

Harold, having the urge to take a leak, ran past Rodney, Mike, and Ella, much to their confusion.

Chris took another sip of coffee. ""I didn't want it to come to this. I said that to Chef Hatchet last night. I said 'Chef? I don't want it to come to this!' But darn it. These campers are tough! And so, I've come up with the most boring, sleep-inducing activity I can find.""

Confessional: Sky

""What else can they do to make us break?"" Sky spoke. ""My team needs me here.""

Confessional Ends

Chris took out a large book. ""The History of Canada,"" he announced. ""A Pop-up Book, Chapter One. The Beaver. National symbol, and a 'dam' fine hat."" The last six campers groaned at the pun.

The scene cut to a group of beavers tail-slapping a group of logs they'd been on, apparently doing this for hours. Though Owen was resting on the dam, and one of the beavers was slapping his butt.

The timer had reached eighty-seven hours and Chris was still reading. ""...which of course, was the precursor for the discussions,"" both Dawn and Eva were shown to have fallen asleep, ""leading to the War of 1812.""

The scoreboard was now 2-2, though Sky finally moved forward and fell asleep, and the scoreboard updated once again.

""You know, if I didn't know what was happening, I'd probably be freaking out right now,"" Shawn told the camera.

The scene flashed to Chris. ""Time for a bathroom break!"" he announced. ""Any takers?""

""I've held it this long, man! I can go all day!"" Duncan said to Brick.

""But can you hold it in for another ten chapters?"" Brick sneakily dared him.

""You've got five minutes,"" Chris said as Duncan passed him by, ""as long as you don't mind a little company.""

Duncan looked over his shoulder. ""Fine. But stay out of the stall.""

The shot cut back to Shawn. ""You can do this. Just a little bit more,"" he told himself. ""This is something you've trained for.”

As for Brick, he was struggling to stay awake while being seated.

The scene changed to the outside of a bathroom stall. ""Duncan! You in there?"" a male voice called, opening the stall to see Duncan sleeping on the toilet.

Chris was shown waiting at his podium, and was handed a note from someone off-screen. ""And we have news! It looks like Duncan's taken a dive on the can!”

""It's you and me now,"" Brick told his opponent.

""Looks like it,"" Shawn confirmed.

Shawn and Brick then glared at each other, but both felt really tired and the first one to fall asleep was…

…

…

…

Shawn.

“The official winner of the Awake-a-Thon is… Brick!"" Chris announced, holding up Brick's arm after he finally collapsed to sleep. ""The Screaming Gophers win!""

The footage cut to the Bass' cabin, where the team were gathered outside and looking scared. Eva was inside throwing everything out, and most of their belongings were already hurled to the ground.

""WHERE IS MY MP3 PLAYER!?"" Eva roared in rage and looked out the window. ""One of you must've stolen it! I need my music! No one is going anywhere until I get my MP3 player back!!""

The bodybuilder threw out a book, and Harold ducked down to avoid getting hit in the face.

""Whoever stole Eva's MP3 player should just give it up now or we won't get to sleep,"" Ella begged.

It was then that Heather entered the scene with the player. ""Hey, guys! Wow, this place is a real mess,"" she remarked after seeing the Bass' dilemma.

""Someone stole Eva's MP3 player,"" Rodney answered.

""You don't mean this, do you?"" Heather pulled out the player. Eva saw it and quickly came over. ""I was wondering who it belonged to. I found it by the campfire pit. You must've dropped it.""

""Oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you!"" Eva gratefully thanked the queen bee and hugged her device in the process.

""Sure thing,"" Heather departed.

Confessional: Heather

""Turn a team against their own member? Easiest trick in the book,"" Heather explained.

Confessional Ends

Eva looked back to see her teammates scowling at her.

""So... sorry about that little... misunderstanding,"" Eva said in an attempt at an apology. ""Guess no one stole it after all."" The looks on the Bass' faces didn't change a bit.

""Okay. Maybe I overreacted a little,"" the muscle woman continued, but failed to appeal to anyone.

The scene skipped to the elimination ceremony. Chris was shown walking towards the Killer Bass with a plate of marshmallows.

""You've all cast your votes and made your decision,"" Chris said. ""There are only nine marshmallows on this plate. When I call your name, come up and claim your marshmallow.""

""The camper who does not receive a marshmallow, must immediately return to the Dock of Shame, catch the Boat of Losers, and leave. And you can never come back. Ever,"" Chris told the tired and worn out contestants.

""The first marshmallow goes to Shawn!"" Chris said, the boy picking a marshmallow off the plate.

""Duncan!""

""Ella!""

""Katie and Sadie!""

The two girls hugged each other and squealed.

""Mike!""

""Rodney!”

""Ezekiel!""

""Campers, this is the final marshmallow of the evening!"" Chris announced to Eva and Harold, who were the scared bottom two.

…

…

…

…

""Harold!"" Chris announced, and the dweeb grabbed his marshmallow.

""Nice. Really nice. Who needs this stupid TV show anyway?!"" Eva complained, to which a few of her teammates were scared.

Eva kicked Chris in the leg and made her way to the boat.

Chris held up his leg in pain. ""Have a good night sleep tonight,"" he told the remaining Bass. ""You're all safe.""

Confessional: Rodney

""I did feel attracted to Eva, but after seeing how hostile she can be, I realized that we wouldn't work as a couple,"" Rodney confessed.

Confessional: Heather

""So Eva was one of their strongest players. And now she's gone. I am so running this game,"" Heather boasted in glory.

Confessional Ends

The focus was now on the Boat of Losers. As it sped off, Eva was sulking until she noticed the camera.

""I guess my temper got the better of me. Again,"" she said. ""But whatever. They just lost their fiercest competitor. I hope they realize that sooner or later.""

Back to the Killer Bass, they were all roasting their marshmallows over the bonfire. ""Hopefully we won't have to end up back here next time!"" Shawn led the activity as they all raised their sticks.

The camera cut to the inside of a cave to show a group of sasquatches watching over Owen sleeping, one of them poking him with a stick. They tossed him out, and the camera closed in on him still sleeping as the episode ended.

What We Found Wasn’t Human.,"If you don’t know what’s going on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/aneYuFxG1y) will explain what’s happened. 

I don’t usually post. I read. Quietly. Mostly on night shift, when nothing’s moving and my thoughts get too loud. 

After the calls of wellness checks when the little old lady on the corner croaks and you walk in to her dog eating her face because the poor thing hasn’t eaten since she last fed it. 

Of domestic abuse where the piece of shit husband has bashed his wife’s nose into her skull for over cooking his steak. 

Drive by shootings off [redacted] road when a single mother reading her babies a book takes a stray round through the skull.  

On nights where a drunk driver hits a kid, a little girl the same age as yours, and you try all you can to resuscitate them just to lose them in your arms and all you can do is cry. 

Or when one of the people sworn to protect your community kill someone  just for trying to get the insurance papers out of their glove box, 

or when some deranged piece of shit kills four of your colleagues over a warrant, 

Or it’s just when I pull someone over for driving like a dumbass after one of the calls mentioned above and they ask for your name and badge number and tell you how you’re just a public servant. 
It’s hard and I never wanted to be the guy unloading personal nightmares onto strangers on the internet. I like to read to keep the monsters quiet. 

But I can’t sleep. 

It’s been a couple days since that fuck shit with the deer in my yard. What am I saying? It COULDN’T have been a deer. 
It was in my yard cursing…
with MY voice—and I can’t keep this inside anymore. I haven’t slept. I’ve torn my house apart looking for that damn tooth. I know I brought it back. I remember holding it. But it’s just… gone. And I’m still wondering why the fuck I’m missing a tooth now. OR what I did in that hour I fell unconscious. 

I’m not saying I believe in curses. But I believe in patterns. I believe when too many people tell the same story, it stops being a coincidence.

And guys I’m not the only one.

After I posted that story—about the white deer things and the crying and hearing my own goddamn voice —my inbox lit up. Ten different messages from ten different accounts, all describing the same thing. Different places. Different years. Same white deer. Same baby cries. Same kind of tooth. Same weird loss of time. 

And always the same ending: something terrible happens.

One guy flipped his car. Broke his spine. Was out on a hike. Saw white deer. Lost an hour. Lost a tooth. Found a baby tooth.
Another guy’s wife disappeared without a trace. She went walking in the woods, said she saw a (you guessed it) White deer. He had seen them too lost an hour, lost a tooth, and found a baby tooth. 
Some lady lost EVERYTHING because she swore while she was out taking soil samples for a homeowner she saw a white deer mimicking voices. Lost an hour, lost a tooth. And she ALSO found a baby tooth. 
One said his son vanished from a locked bed room. No signs of a break-in. Just short rough white hair on the pillow, bedsheets, and drapes. He went hunting that morning. Guess what he fucking saw, found and lost????

Every one of them said the same thing:

“I wish I never found that tooth.”

So I was spiraling. I ripped up every junk drawer. Tore through my gear, my closets, even the drain traps. Nothing.

I went out to BOTH cars, my daily and my cruiser. It was dark as shit outside and I did the whole “shit where is it” search you do in your car when you drop something, I popped open my glove boxes, fucking sunglasses holder and center armrest compartment in the cruiser. I moved the seats forward and backward, I searched the trunk of my Impala, just golf and gym bags, I searched the cracks of the seats. 

Nothing. 

I don’t know what made me say it, maybe frustration or habit, but when I gave up looking, I muttered:
“Goddammit, where the fuck are you?”

And from out in the distance— in the woods that surround my home, clear as day—I heard my voice answer.

Only it wasn’t me. Not really.

Same words. Same tone. Just… wrong. Off. Like something was mimicking me but didn’t understand how.

I grabbed my gun from my waist band (I’m not going anywhere without one ever again)  and ran to the porch. 

And it was standing at the fucking tree line.

An albino deer..

On its hind legs, tall as a man, antlers like pale driftwood. Its mouth hung open,cocked off to the side, its eyes glassed over, its tongue draped off its teeth like a creature from a Lovecraft novel,  but it didn’t speak. Just waited. Watching.

“What the fuck…” I whispered.

It said it back. Without moving its mouth. Just gargling like a person who had a stroke choking on words. 

Twisted. Crooked. Like a recording run through broken tape:
WhhAAhHt Thhuhh Fuhhhkkk…

I backed inside. Locked the door. Ran to the bathroom and locked that too. I sat in the tub with the lights off. I cried. I’d never cried that hard. After about an hour I didn’t hear anything, and thought the coast was clear and I wish I would’ve just stayed where I was but something told me to look out the window above my shower. 

I did. 
I wish I didn’t. 
Once again, I saw a group of albino deer things in my yard, this time it was more obvious they weren’t  deer. They didn’t have to hide it. Their mouths agape, and my voice was coming out of all of them. And  just like that I had lost another hour, and when I came to I was missing ANOTHER FUCKING TOOTH. I was also trying to climb out the window and crawl out to the deer. But I became aware before they realized. I started shaking from fear and  I pushed myself back into my bathroom slammed the window shut LOCKED IT and I ran to the light switch in my bathroom and flipped it on, went back to the window and the deer were gone. 
I had pissed myself again. And I was bleeding profusely from my mouth. But I wasn’t going to budge. I sat in the tub, lights on, until sunrise.  
All night, I heard them outside the house.

I heard my own voice, over and over. Echoing around the property.
I spoke again like an idiot. I said “I’m going crazy.” 

They answered. Croaking at first. Like a toddler learning its words. 

“Eim gAon CracHie” 

“I’m gAon Cratzchy” 

“I’m going CrAAAzchy” 

“I’m going crazy…”

“…going crazy…”

“…crAAaazy…”

Then the fucking baby started crying again. 

Like a chorus. Not loud. Just… there. 

I sat there in the tub until the voices became the ambient sounds of my home, replacing the hum of my fridge or the ice maker that’s always frightened me at night. Never again. 

I took leave from work yesterday. Couldn’t think straight. Spent most of the day on my couch, Glock on my lap, TV on but muted. Just waiting. 

Then, last night, I got another message. No name. Just a throwaway account. All it said was:

“Do you have a fireplace?”

I wrote back: “Yeah. Why?”

They responded: 
“Do you have a gun”

I wrote back: 
“No I’m a gun less cop in a major city, they only let me play with a fucking vacuum cleaner and my names Doofy.” 

They wrote back:
 “Do. You. Have. A. Gun.” 

I wrote back: 
“YES OF COURSE I HAVE A GUN” 

They responded: 
“You need to roll your bullets in FINE, GROUND, white ash. Only thing that slows them down. You need to do it right now, and I need your address.” 

I didn’t question it. 

I just did it. I sent my address too. Why I sent a stranger my address I don’t know. But help is help is help. 

I emptied the fireplace, ground the ash fine, mortar and pestle, and rolled every round in it like flour. Then I loaded up my Glock, lit a cigarette, last one. Crumpled the pack, threw it on the coffee table and I decided I’d drive back to the woods—back where I first heard the baby crying. 

The trees were quiet this time. No sound. No animals. Not even fucking bugs. There was a smell. Like a rotting animal. 

Then I found it. 

I found the spot no sleep..

But I can’t tell you how I wish I didn’t. 

A circle of flattened grass like something had been lying there. It stunk. In the center were seven items, all laid out in a perfect circle :
The baby tooth.

My teeth. Silver Fillings and all. 

My mother’s diamond ring. 
The one my wife left behind when she walked out. 

A family photo, my baby girl my ex-wife and myself at [redacted]. I swore was still in a box in the attic. Along with all the other shit she abandoned. 


An empty pack of Marlboros…
My empty pack of Marlboros…
The pack of Marlboros I JUST FUCKING LEFT ON MY COFFEE TABLE…


And my daughter’s old music box. 

I was shaking and sweating again just like the night I ran into the deer. 

None of this made sense. The fucking teeth, I hadn’t seen that ring in years. The photo was private. The music box? My ex said she lost it in the move. 
I stared at all of it for a long time. Then I made the worst mistake I’ve made yet.

I took everything. Even the baby tooth. 
I don’t know what came over me—some primal urge to protect it, or maybe to understand. I shoved it all in my pack and drove home. Heart racing. Felt like something was watching me the whole way.

Now I’m here.

I’ve locked every door. Every window. I’ve unplugged my TV. I’ve Covered my mirrors cause nope. It doesn’t matter. The cameras still work. Every light in my house is on. 

I was writing this just now—typing it out, thinking maybe someone would tell me what to do—when I saw the motion alert on my phone.
Backyard camera. 12:44 AM.
I opened the app and dropped my phone.
There’s something standing in my yard again. 

Two figures.
One of them IS my daughter.
The other one is me.
But I haven’t moved from this chair.
And she’s supposed to be at her mom’s. 
She’s obviously very tired and she’s looking at me in a very odd way. 
Well the thing that’s supposed to be me. 
But then I realized. 

It’s my weekend.

I have way more information, just can’t find an attorney in the area as the only one represents both cities involved.

I need help. Please read and help me get my life back that a post master from USPS took away from me and to tell my story.

A few years ago I purchased a piece of land that we were going to build a home on and start a business. Before I actually moved we got our ducks in a row literally being handed a check list to make sure we stayed legal with the state and USPS. At that time, the post master in my area was very impressed how quickly we had put everything together. I continued to plan and organize to begin my business and moved to Missouri (my life long dream, due to the family I had in the area) from there the new post master made my life a living hell.

She told me I couldn’t move receive mail. I told her we have the permits to build, a temporary permit to live in said trailer. She told me I had the wrong permits. So I went to the county and again paid thousands of dollars for way more permits than required. I went back, which then she stated I had to have a foundation poured, and framing of the home up (this was a lie) for almost 2-3 months I lost thousands of dollars fighting her. Contacting my congressman and filling out privacy paperwork for him to step in. I wrote a congressional letter to the oversight committee in Washington.

Congressman called and told me this would no longer be a problem, I received a phone call from the post master general in Union station. Again stating my services would not be disrupted. I never heard back at that moment from the congressional oversight committee, probably because she was keeping my mail!

I went in after receiving these phone calls and she continued to try and argue. I told her “please don’t make me write another letter”

A few weeks later my kids in the local school, had an anonymous phone call about my kids not having what they need. I feel I was stupid in this moment. I questioned who could have done this?

Live moved on, my fiancée moved into an apartment and I kept running business out of the property, and my trailer is still there.

On feb. 20th I was wrongfully told to move from my apartment- I won’t go into details however this landlords wife ran a coffee shop. He told us to come there to conduct business multiple times due to him never answering his phone. So I went there. An argument broke out.

Feb 24th we had a letter dated Feb 23 that we had to be out.

After weeks of trying to find somewhere to live we just couldn’t afford somewhere, or nothing would be ready in time. We looked from downtown KC to Chillicothe. In every direction. I ended up leaving my state job, moving my fiancée back.

I asked my aunt during this move to check our mail. I was withdrawing my pension to see if I could get my fiancee in a place.

Mind you up until this point my business I was still receiving my mail, and running my business.

On 4/09/2025 again being dumb I believed I had no mail thinking we got something that flooded the mailbox.

On 4/10 I called the post office. I didn’t recognize the voice. So I gave my name. First she didn’t know me, didn’t know how to spell my 7th nationally common last name, then I gave the address. Being told she didn’t know, could I say it again multiple times. I did, with no problem. Her saying yeah I have nothing. I said “weird but I’ve had issues before” then USPS worker then said with nothing else being said. “Yes problem with me, and I drove by your property and the grass was high, I deemed it vacant” I said “did you even knock on the door?” No. I became very angry. I tried to fight my point before being hung up on. I called back saying this was bs. Again hung up on. I called the congressman days to years is what they said. I tried to reach out to the post master general again. No answer. I called the law and told them this lady is acting out of her roam of work. They said they would call back. I then began searching for lawyers in the area. 6 phone calls everybody telling me I have a case just not sure what type of lawyer I needed.

The county officer called and told me that without any notice she sent all my mail back to sender. Any contracts my business had, any checks were there to be collected, my pension. I asked to press charges. They told me it was civil.

So I called a police department that was still in our county. I talked to a police officer, like myself who took business law. He agreed the case was strong. Told me a real estate attorney, but to go back and speak to the county planning and zoning.

When I called  on 4/10/2025 I said my name, and why I was calling. She said she remembered me. I told her I wrote a letter congress. She said she knew. The post master had been calling every couple months to 6 months asking about my permits, I was told they were watching my property, taking photos, she had been having conversations of the slandering kind in the very coffee shop that my fiancée’s landlord and his wife owned, I was told she had been having coffee with the county commissioner about me, and to watch my back. Oh, and that she was the one calling the school. All her claims were false, but continued to conspire with other local officials against me.

I was puzzled. So I called the county clerk to obtain the commissioners phone number. I left a voicemail.

By gosh if not 20 minutes later the county sheriff called to say my mail was at the post office. I said “I thought it was sent back to sender?” She was shocked as well.

The best legal help I got was www.missourilawyers.org by the Missouri bar association Where they want me to pay $51 to be heard. I am at a loss, broke. I closed my business account that once held 40- 50,000 with $60.17.

I live with my boyfriend (m26) as well in a studio who works even earlier than me at 5am, so no way could someone spend the night. 
         We were suppose to make Easter baskets when we got to my house after the beach. I figured it’d give them time to sober up while we do a fun activity so they don’t get a third dui & lose their good job. They decided to take a strong edible & was falling asleep when I needed them to leave so I could start dinner. They started telling me “I don’t really give a shit,” “Shut the fuck up.” I feel like an asshole because I called their mom trying to get advice. She just told me to call the cops. I kept trying to get him to sober up with coffee, water & food but he didn’t want anything. When I finally got him outside to sit in his car to wait for an uber from his mom, he like jumped at me, that things men do like they’re about to hit you. I’m 4’9 women so I was just kinda over it since he knows my ex abused me.

           My boyfriend wants the car out of here for disrespecting me & doesn’t really care since he knows he drinks on the job anyway.

1k1tgsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1k1tgsc/how_and_why_you_should_delete_your_old_text/,How and Why You Should Delete Your Old Text Messages,"Imagine this: You're enjoying a well-deserved retirement, sipping coffee on your patio, when suddenly, your phone buzzes. It's an old text thread—a conversation you thought was long gone. Suddenly, you're reliving a moment from years ago that you'd rather forget. From accidentally too candid messages after a few drinks to important yet compromising information like banking details and personal passwords, we've all been there. But what if I told you that deleting those old texts could save you from potential embarrassment and privacy breaches?

As we journey through retirement, it's crucial to keep our digital lives as tidy as our physical spaces. **Old text messages** might seem harmless, but they can pose some real threats. Let's dive into why you should consider deleting older texts and how you can do it safely and effectively.

 Keeping your **phone storage** free from clogging texts can also breathe new life into your device, making it run smoother and faster. Think about the last time you tried to take a photo or download an app when your storage was full—it’s not a pleasant experience! By keeping your text messages in check, you're taking a proactive step towards maintaining a stress-free digital life.

If you’re using an **iPhone**, you’ve got a couple of options. You can manually delete individual messages by swiping left and tapping 'Delete,' or if you're feeling a bit more aggressive, you can select multiple to get rid of them in bulk. For a more hands-off approach, you can enable the automatic delete feature in your settings. This way, older messages are deleted after a certain time period, helping you keep clutter at bay without lifting a finger.

**Android** users aren't left out either. If you're using Google Messages, deleting old texts is a breeze. Just select multiple conversations and hit the delete button. Some messaging apps like Google’s Messages don’t support automatic deleting, but Samsung’s Messages app as well as Apple’s iTunes does support selective message deletion.

Now, what if I told you that you might actually have some control over those awkward messages you sent in the heat of the moment? With the latest updates, you can try to unsend a text under certain conditions. For **iMessage** users, if you’re on iOS 16 or later, you can recall a message within 2 minutes of hitting send. And get this—you can even edit a message within 15 minutes. Pretty neat, huh?

Over on the **Android** side, things are a bit different. While Google Messages doesn’t support unsending texts natively, apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger do. Just remember, there are limitations—if the recipient has already seen the message, it’s gone for good in their mind (and potentially in screenshots as well).

But why go through all this trouble? Well, besides the obvious privacy and embarrassment factors, deleting old texts is a solid strategy for **secure retirement planning**. Think about it—too many old messages lying around could be a goldmine for hackers or identity thieves. By keeping your conversations current and relevant, you’re adding an extra layer of security to your personal information.

Here’s a practical tip: Make it a habit to regularly clear out outdated conversations and double-check before sending any sensitive information. And if you really want to step up your game, consider using encrypted messaging apps like **Signal or WhatsApp**. These apps add an extra layer of security, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read your messages.

Remember, your retirement is a time to enjoy life, not worry about old texts coming back to haunt you. So, take control of your digital footprint today. What steps have you taken to declutter your digital life? Or maybe you have a story about a text message gone wrong? Share your thoughts, experiences, or advice in the comments below. Let’s start a conversation and help each other navigate our digital journeys as smoothly as possible.",1,1744940575.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1k1tfjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenNoCensor/comments/1k1tfjv/looking_for_some_perspective_on_a_leftfield/,Looking for some perspective on a left-field rejection,"Bit of a wall of text, but I'm perplexed by this rejection, I really don't understand and would love some perspective. It feels like if things went this well and I still got rejected that it's almost hopeless. 

I'm 31M, and went on a date with a 28F. She had liked on dating app, we had a brief convo before I asked her to coffee. Both are dating apps are explicit that we're looking for something long-term. We live an hour from each other so we met half way. 

The date was really nice, we had good conversation and we made out a little at the end, and I asked her on another date and she suggested getting dinner the next Saturday.

Over the next week we talked on Instagram, and she even started texting me suggestive photos of herself and she asked for some of even and I sent her a couple of shirtless pictures (not trying to brag, but I'm in really good shape myself and she expressed that she found me attractive). We talked pretty regularly throughout the week.

Then on the date we got dinner, went and played some board games at a cafe, and the whole time (it seemed) like we were really enjoying each other's company and I was really on my game in terms of making her laugh. Then she gave me her phone number, which I saw as a positive step since she didn't want to give it on the first date. We were making out and I suggested we go back to my place and she stopped to think about it, but I told her I would respect whatever boundaries she had. So she agreed, and we got there she wanted me just as much as I wanted her and we were intimate for nearly 3 hours. During downtime between having sex we talked about deeper stuff about our past - past relationships, our younger lives, etc- and it felt like we were bonding. What really gets me is how she told me I stood out from other guys on the apps because I was asking thoughtful questions and I asked to meet her half-way from where we live since most guys assume she'll come to them. I made her orgasm a couple of times and she told me she had a feeling I would be really good at it. I got a bit worried because we had sex without protection, which was the first time doing that in a really long time for me, but we both communicated that as far as we knew we didn't have any STIs and she had a birth control implant. 

After all that I told her she was welcome to spend the night but understood if she wanted to leave. She ultimately decided against sleeping over but I walked her to her car and we kissed tonight and both said we wanted to see each other again. I waited a bit and texted her if she got home okay with no response and ended up falling asleep. The next morning I texted her again asking if she made it home safely. After a while with no response I started to get nervous that she fell asleep driving home or something, and I tried calling her with no answer. I was pretty damn worried and even called Highway Patrol to see if there had been any accidents. When they said there hadn't been any I realized she was ghosting me.

A few days later I messaged her again asking her if I had done something wrong. She responded that she didn't see things going anywhere and that she was thinking a lot about our date because I'm so funny and kind, but that she shouldn't be convincing herself that she wants to see me again.

I can understand if she didn't find me attractive, but that seems really difficult to reconcile given everything. I don't think it's a basic shallow reason, I've got the 666 down (>6 ft, 6 figures, 6 pack). If a woman can find me attractive, funny, kind, and good in bed, and still not want to go any further (even to a third date), then what in the world else is there for me to do? I'm feeling very discouraged about this and would love for more female perspective and what could have happened here.

**""Chronology of Citrus and Bronze""**  

My mother claimed I was born beneath a perverse eclipse. That night, the moon did not submit to shadow but bled rust-colored light, staining the delivery room’s window lattice like the copper serpents of Exodus. When the midwife severed the umbilical cord, her scissors floated in the pool of blood, blades pivoting north—a detail the church deacon later called *the devil’s compass*, though I knew it was only metal’s honest reply to lunar tides.  

At twelve, I met a talking moon in the citrus grove. She dangled between lime branches, her silver glare condensing into italicized script: *“All fruit were once flowers, but not all flowers dare to fruit.”* Her voice felt like silk rinsed in glacial water, grazing my newly budding collarbones. That night, I stole my father’s acetylene torch, the one he used to weld fishing nets, and branded a crescent scar into my left forearm—a covenant truer than baptism.  

During the monsoon of my seventeenth year, sea anemones bloomed in the church confessional. When I slid my fingers through the wooden lattice, the priest’s breath turned briny: *“Child, your way of loving women is a coral reef grown upside-down.”* His absolution bubbled through my ears into the fissures of my brain. In the margins of *Leviticus*, I sketched mating anglerfish, annotating with scholastic logic: *The bioluminescent lure on her spine is God’s own wedding band.*  

At twenty-four, I collided with a woman in bronze-tailored suiting at a secondhand bookshop. Isobars coiled around her neck like a necklace; her ring finger bore a cogwheel reshaped into a band. *“Shall we exchange pains?”* she asked, offering a desiccated half of Seville orange. I swallowed the fruit and tasted moonlight from 1997. She plucked the twelve-year-old scar from my pupils, threading it into her pocket watch’s chain as a pendant.  

Now we dwell in a lighthouse, refracting each other’s bodies through prisms into spectra. The tide delivers stained glass shards from demolished chapels. We grind them into powder, stirring the grit into midnight coffee. When the priests’ edicts rumble through our guts like pipe organs, we kiss until our lips split into Delphi’s fissures, until every prophecy dissolves into salt on our tongues.  

Last night, the moon returned in italics. This time, she wrote: *“Polar night approaches, but persist in photosynthesis.”* We split the final preserved citrus, finding a miniature deluge curled in its pulp. Now we spoon Noah’s ark from the rind, while the horizon’s sea level remains—always, relentlessly—one millimeter below regret.  

---  
**Style Notes**:  
- **Liquid Metaphors**: Winterson often melts boundaries between body/nature/object. Here, blood *pools*, moonlight *bleeds*, and kisses *dissolve* into salt.  
- **Queer Alchemy**: Transforming religious iconography (confessionals, Leviticus) into vessels for forbidden desire, echoing *Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit*.  
- **Temporal Collapse**: Nonlinear narrative mirrors Winterson’s disregard for chronological tyranny—past (1997), present (lighthouse), and mythic time (Delphi, Noah) coexist.  
- **Tactile Surrealism**: Scissors float, scars become jewelry, and citrus holds miniature floods—hallucinatory yet visceral, a hallmark of her magic realism.",2,1744940345.0,WritingWithAI,0,0.75,False

1k1tcev,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsfield/comments/1k1tcev/life_in_pittsfield/,Life in Pittsfield,"Know this is an extremely broad question.

Context that I've lived in Bar Harbor a few years now doing seasonal and sporadic work on/in farms, roofs, restaurants, boats, canoes, shoveling wet sand into muddy fields to regrade the slope, windows, retirement homes, refinishing patio furniture, coffee shops, water heaters, bathrooms, sheds, greenhouses etc etc etc etc

I've loved the quiet and total, silent stillness of winter watching the snow fall on a farm by myself as the wood stove's fan is purring but I hate the summers and onslaught of 70+ hour weeks. Feeling too thin spread to keep at it and the landowner on the property I live on in exchange for upkeep work isn't getting any younger and idk, if I stay here the rest of my life, I'll end up dying of alcoholism or taking a bad spill in the winter ice 8 miles away from the nearest hospital. I kinda want out of Vacationland.

Early 30s, queer, regretting putting an X on my gender marker in Maine. Fell in love with someone in Boston but feel too autisticly overwhelmed with city noise and too poor to think about moving to Boston. Like the idea of living in a small town with an Amtrak stop that would make it easy to see my partner in the Midwest too. (freebie autistic person loving trains joke)

\------------

How's Pittsfield without a car? How's public transit? I'm used to 14 mile walks to get groceries in the winters here and feel like that's my upper limit of tolerance. Can I afford to live in a total hole by myself or with minimal roommates? I took up playing sax two years ago and love it; how is finding places that would let me open mic? I don't have a degree, but do have a  ""fundamentals of accounting"" certificate from a community college I went to years ago and know quickbooks fairly well. Idly doing coursera courses on data analytics, medical coding, and accounting (as a refresher). Years of restaurant prep cook / baker XP. I dunno, pulling 40-50 hour work weeks all year vs. months of little to do and then nightmare hours seems more manageable.

1k1t6th,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k1t6th/an_update_from_5_weeks_ago/,An update from 5 weeks ago.,"I posted this a few weeks back and this an update as to where I am now. 
A reminder that it DOES get better. I still get sad, I still tear up. I still get nightmares and my sleep is not back to normal. But I’m starting to feel like myself again. 

Always trust your gut and notice the red flags.
This something that I’m hoping I will learn through my healing journey. 
You are all worth it and deserve all the love. Xx

Help needed with on going post-break up Anxiety. 

Hey Reddit.

This might be a long one. Firstly 37 M, I am medically diagnosed and treated with GAD for the last 12 years.

I was in a relationship for the past 16 months. Things were going good.

A month ago I caught my partner (31 M) lying to me about where they were (Share my location on iPhone and finding out they were at a hotel), I confronted them and they ended up admitting that they may have caught feelings for someone else, which included just a kiss at party event during a drug fueled state 2-3 weeks prior. This person was with them at the time, which they confirmed was just to set boundaries due to what happened at the party.

They never told me about the kiss, nor did they tell me about the hotel. When he messaged me that day, he said he was feeling sick and heading home to have an early night, then we spoke around the time he was driving to the hotel and told me he was driving home. Then sent me our usual love you goodnight messages, it was in replying to that I saw the location.  
I only found out about the hotel when he said the following day that he had another night booked.

At first we broke it off, then I said I wanted to work on the relationship. He was crying on the phone telling me how much he hates himself for fucking this up. 
3 weeks ago I decided to bite the bullet, and he explained a few more things to me, but ended up putting things on a break, no contact, no social media etc. (we tried this last week, but they wouldn’t respect my boundaries and apologised for this later on). They have also been stressed and worried as they know what this has done to me mentally.

The same evening, my housemate messaged my ex and the other guy, asking questions. My ex cracked and said that he could not see a future with me as he wouldn’t feel comfortable being around my housemate in future and I said I don’t think I could trust anything he said ever again.

We blocked each other on social media, I archived some Instagram photos etc. He ended up getting the guy to block me, block my housemate and my best friend (who had nothing to do with any of this).

A few days after he ended up posting on Instagram with a summer album and a bunch of photos tagging the guy along with selfies of both of them.

10 days ago, he made contact via text, asking if I was doing any better. I ended up blocking his number.

They have been hanging out together every weekend since.

There has been a lot of inconsistencies with the whole situation. I originally met him when he was on a break with his ex and when I friend-zoned him, he got back with his ex, then we started seeing each other and they were on a break again. This happened a few times as I friend zoned him a few times, because my gut was telling me something was off. He has never said one nice thing about any of his ex boyfriends.  
He managed to get me to block people on FB that I have known for years, because they were related to one of his ex's.

On Valentines day he had to be home at an earlier time as he had a Valentines Day tradition with his mum where they would go out for coffee cake etc, however the year before we hung out till late and he has never mentioned this tradition.

He used to stay at this guys place in the spare room and they would hang out during the end of December and Jan, he would hire a hotel cause it was cheaper than paying for an Uber in and out of town. No invites to me, as I had work the next day most of those times.  
Also on Valentine’s Day he asked me to turn my insta on private, because apparently his school kids were looking at profiles and making comments. The day he posted the summer photo album, his Instagram went public (back to private now).  
Every time we would post stories of us on his Insta, he would only post them to close friends, this started in January 2025. The last time he posted a photo of both of us on SM was in late last year.

Last Saturday I re-connected with one of our mutual contacts, who stopped talking to me for no reason. He ended up admitting that they had sex multiple times (provided with photo evidence) 4 months into our relationship. He told this guy that we were in an open relationship and that I would not care. Then things got weird and he asked this guy not to talk to me.  
Even more context, when we first got together, I wanted to try an open relationship and he said he was not comfortable with this. We agreed that we would stay closed until we both were ready.  
I did not cheat once.

I feel like everything that is happening since a month ago, has made my anxiety and depression spiral. Every time I start getting a bit better, something new comes up (like last Saturday) and it increases it all again. I keep thinking about him and it hurts and my anxiety goes up. My appetite still hasn’t fully come back and I am sleeping 5.5-6 hours a night, compared to my usual 8.  
Is this normal? Will my sleep and appetite return as I heal?

Should I also confront him? or keep him deleted out of my life? I don't think he will ever be honest with me, considering he was so ""happy"" throughout the relationship.    
I keep thinking of how many other guys there might have been. All the red flags I could have missed.

Happy to answer any questions relating to this.

I have been walking daily, going to work, meditating daily, no caffeine and recently stopped drinking my regular 1-2 glasses of wine. Any help or pointers on dealing with this, the anxiety and anything is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

\*\*\*\*\* 3 WEEK UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*

6 weeks since the break up. He is now officially in a relationship with the guy from the hotel. This is all over socials and not a secret anymore.  
Definitely don't want any contact with this person. He doesn't deserve it.

Anxiety has gone down major since the last post and I have been doing all sorts of fun things with friends. I'm only really anxious about running into him and how I would react given everything that has happened.  
Still going to dig deep within myself for some healing, how I can pick up these red flags earlier on and remind myself that I was open and honest in this relationship and he was not. Moving on to bigger and better things.

Lately, I’ve been trying to eat healthier and be more mindful of my habits. I work a physically demanding job—9 hours a day on my feet plus over an hour of walking total. By the time I get home, I’m usually exhausted, so I just eat, shower, relax a bit, and sleep.

Recently, I ate some cookies that my roommate bought (they’re my favorite), and my boyfriend said I ate all of them. Then he mentioned that I’ve been eating too much and suggested I start vaping again to suppress my appetite—but also said that would be the easy way out and I should be working out instead. He also told me that my roommate apparently thinks the same thing and added that I’m always too tired after work to do anything else.

All of this really got to me. I already try to eat reasonably—coffee in the morning, a wrap with eggs and bacon, something light for lunch, and whatever I can manage for dinner. Nothing crazy. But now I feel self-conscious and kind of ashamed. I even felt weird eating the pizza I bought for both of us. I want to buy groceries, but I feel too judged to even do that.

1k1sud7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1k1sud7/third_wave_water_am_i_buying_the_wrong_distilled/,"Third Wave Water – Am I buying the ""wrong"" distilled water?","Here's the story:

I've been brewing with unfiltered Toronto tap water for years and finally decided to up my game. Bought some TWW (classic profile, 1 gal packets) and a few jugs of distilled water. I first tasted the distilled water on its own out of curiosity / for perspective (never tasted pure water before). As expected, it tasted noticeably worse than most other water I've had (including tap). I'd describe it as bitter or almost nickel-like. Similar to Aquafina or Dasani.

Dumped a TWW packet into a gallon of distilled water, shook like hell, and left overnight. The next morning, I tasted the mixed water before brewing (again, for perspective). It tasted a lot better than distilled, but still worse than tap. That bitter/metallic taste was significantly reduced but still quite present. I thought, well maybe it won't be noticeable in brewed coffee. Alas, it very much is. Granted, the coffee was improved in certain ways (more flavour, esp. the brighter/fruity notes), but the experience is totally ruined by an ""Aquafina-like"" aftertaste (2-3 seconds after swallowing).

I then thought, hey maybe not all distilled water is the same. So I bought a few different brands. Here's what I bought (in case anyone's familiar):

* Selection
* President's Choice
* Eska (technically demineralized water, not distilled)
* Ice River Green Bottle Co.

I tasted all of these side by side (nothing added). They all taste surprisingly unique. But, they all have that same metallic taste to some degree. By far, the Ice River tasted the best to me so I went with that one. I mixed with TWW, and the next morning I once again tasted it before brewing. As expected, it tasted better than the previous TWW I made but still not great. I brewed some coffee and again, definitely better than the previous TWW brewed, but that aftertaste is still unmistakably there.

I can't believe this is what coffee water is supposed to taste like. Am I missing something? As of now, my strongest theory is that I still haven't found the ""right"" distilled water, as crazy as that might sound after trying 4 brands. **More evidence of this is that it's quite popular to reduce the TWW dose to 1/2 or even 1/3, which would only exacerbate my issue, i.e. reveal more of the actual distilled water taste.**

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance.

P.S. I realize I could also try a ZeroWater filter (or reverse osmosis, etc.) instead of buying distilled, and maybe I will, but I thought I'd start with a post since I know so many folks are buying distilled to make TWW (and it's also the company's recommendation).",2,1744938590.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

\## ✴️ Chapter Five – “A New Day”  

\*\*Part One: Orbiting Routine\*\*



At exactly \*\*06:00 AM\*\*, Cael's Bracelink buzzed to life with a low chime—soft enough not to jolt, but insistent enough to annoy.



A groggy hand slapped at the edge of the bed. A groan followed.



Cael cracked one eye open, glaring at the blue-glowing holo hovering above his wrist like it had \*personally betrayed him\*.



\*\*Cael\*\*:  

“Ughhh... godsdammit. It’s too early for ambition.”  

\*sigh\* “Better get started with today’s stuff.”



\---



He dragged himself out of bed like a man crawling from wreckage and shuffled into the kitchen, hair askew, hoodie hanging half off one shoulder. No words, just instincts.



His hand landed on the \*\*industrial coffee machine\*\* like it was a sacred artifact. A gift from a war god. Dino’s war god, specifically.



He blinked once. Then pressed the \*\*medium strength brew\*\* button.



The machine came alive with a deep purr—grinding, hissing, pouring—its mechanics smooth, deliberate, and \*way too awake\*.



He added two scoops of sugar, a dash of milk. Swirled it with a tired flick of the spoon.



Then, like a ritual:  

\*\*Coffee first?\*\*  

No.



\*\*Bathroom first.\*\*



\---



He padded into the bathroom on silent feet.



Toothbrush. Minty wash. Mouth rinsed and cleared.  

He studied his face in the mirror, lifting his chin and inspecting his jawline.



“Still smooth,” he muttered, nodding. “Lucky bastard.”



Clothes peeled off. Shower on. Hot.



He stepped in, and let it wash everything away—the sweat, the sleep, the weird dream about a half-Vaelari vending machine challenging him to a duel.



Ten minutes later, towel-wrapped and sighing, he moved with more purpose.



Fresh clothes: fitted charcoal-gray pants, layered tee, baggy \*\*midnight-blue hoodie\*\* that hung loose and comfortable.



Last step: a spritz of \*\*vanilla-orange cologne\*\* from a sleek bottle. Warm, citrusy, grounding. Subtle in the air, but memorable on skin.



“Let’s pretend I know what I’m doing,” he said to the mirror with a wink.



\---



Back in the kitchen, the \*\*coffee\*\* waited like a loyal companion.



He downed the first sip with reverence. Closed his eyes.



“Hell yes,” he whispered. “I forgive you for waking me up, clock.”



Then came breakfast—simple but clean: a veggie protein roll, lightly fried with port-seasoned oil, paired with some fruit cubes and a crunchy nutrient biscuit on the side.



Balanced. Easy. Familiar enough to calm the nerves.



He ate slow, mind already wandering.



Once the plate was clean and the mug was drained, he washed everything with efficient rhythm, towel-dried the counter, and packed a small \*\*day-bag\*\* with snacks and a refillable bottle of chilled citrus water.



Keys. Bracelink. Door.



\*\*07:34 AM.\*\* Time to explore.



\---



\### ✦ The Spire, Morning Shift



The campus felt like a city in motion. Quiet at first—polished hallways, ambient lighting, automated cleaning drones doing their rounds. Then slowly, it began to breathe. Early risers, staff, scattered students weaving into flow.



Cael’s boots echoed as he made his way through the halls of the Axis Spire—his Bracelink gently pinging to show the public zones and shared wings.



First stop: \*\*cafeteria preview wing\*\*—wide, sleek, with adjustable food terminals and scent-adaptive walls. A couple early birds sat in booths, sipping bright-colored liquids or muttering over datapads.



He nodded to a staffer who gave him a curious once-over and a polite smile.  

Cael gave them a lazy salute and moved on.



\*\*Second stop: classroom zones.\*\*



Here’s where it started to feel real.



Doorways with glowing access glyphs. Holo-boards inactive but pulsing. Faculty nameplates already displayed.



He passed \*\*Classroom G-3: Xeno-Diplomacy\*\*, and then \*\*T-9: Combat Theory\*\*—but didn’t linger.



Eventually, he turned a corner and stopped in front of a door labeled:



\> \*\*Professor Elias Askaran – Tech Interface & Engineering Systems\*\*



The door was slightly ajar.



He heard... music?



Old jazz. Twisting through mechanical clicks, like a brass saxophone trying to charm a dying engine.



He knocked once, then pushed it open.



\---



\### ✦ Professor Ash: Chaos Manifest



The inside was a \*\*beautiful mess\*\*. Gears on the table. Wires on the walls. Parts of something that might’ve once been a drone were dangling from the ceiling. And in the middle of it all:



\*\*Professor Elias “Ash” Askaran.\*\*



Gray-haired, wild-bearded, half-goggled, wearing mismatched slippers and a jacket that looked like it belonged in a scrapyard wedding.



Ash turned, one eye wide and wild, the other covered in a welding lens.



“Oh!” he barked. “You must be the port brat.”



Cael blinked. “Um. Technically accurate. Hi. I’m Cael.”



Ash waved a hand and a \*\*four-legged toaster-looking thing\*\* beeped, skittered across the table, and offered Cael a sugar cube.



“Don’t feed him after midnight,” Ash muttered. “He gets ideas.”



Cael took the cube, looked at it, and then grinned. “Does he bite?”



“Only emotionally.”



Ash pointed to the table. “Come on then. You here to learn, or to gawk? Wait. Let me guess. You’re the ‘hands-on’ type. You break things \*just\* to figure out how they tick.”



Cael scratched his cheek. “...Yeah, that’s... freakishly accurate, actually.”



“Good,” Ash said, gesturing wildly. “That means you won’t die in my class. Probably. The toaster’s less certain.”



\---



They talked for twenty minutes—about gear feedback, cross-species interface logic, and the ethics of giving AI systems sarcasm (Ash was pro, for the record).



At some point, the professor handed Cael a half-broken control unit and told him to fix it “by feel.”



Cael laughed. And did.



Ash whooped. The toaster tried to high-five him. Cael high-fived it back.



“You’ll do,” Ash said, and went right back to muttering to himself in an alien dialect while rearranging a holo-display that was definitely upside-down.



Cael left the room with a small smile tugging at his lips and grease on his fingers.



\---



\### ✦ Glances, Greetings, and the Quiet Game



He passed \*\*Instructor Velenn’s room\*\*—sharp-eyed, arms crossed, watching him over the rim of her tea mug.



She raised a brow.  

He smiled back, lazy and warm.



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Morning, ma’am. Love the mug.”



\*\*Velenn\*\*: “I know. I chose it for sarcasm capacity.”



He grinned. “Think I’ve got a decent reading capacity myself.”



She tilted her head slightly, not quite a smile—but not not one.



“Spare me the flirt, cadet,” she said, almost amused. “You’re not graded on charm.”



“Damn,” he said, fake-sulking. “That’s where I put all my points.”



He moved on before she could come up with something clever. She probably already had.



\---



By the time he reached the next wing, the halls were warmer with foot traffic, voices echoing here and there. A pair of instructors passed him in discussion, one nodding in polite acknowledgment. Cael nodded back.



His Bracelink said \*\*11:27 AM\*\*.



And just ahead, gathered in the outer commons by a low planter, he spotted them:



\*\*Two guys, four girls\*\*—all human. All new. Their postures had that same mix of excitement and aimlessness.



He adjusted the strap on his bag, exhaled softly through his nose.



“Alright,” he muttered, brushing a hand through his hair. “Let’s make some damn friends.”



\---



\*\*End of Part One – 11:27 AM\*\*





\## ✴️ Chapter Five – “A New Day”  

\*\*Part Two: Friends and First Impressions\*\*



His Bracelink said \*\*11:27 AM\*\*.



And just ahead, gathered in the outer commons by a low planter, he spotted them:



\*\*Two guys, four girls—all human. All new.\*\* Their uniforms were still stiff in that fresh-issued way, collars sharp, Bracelinks blinking every few seconds like they weren’t fully synced yet. Most had the look of folks trying to act casual while secretly hoping someone would tell them where the hell to go.



Cael adjusted the strap on his backpack, ran a hand through his hair, and gave himself a little smirk.



“Alright,” he muttered, rolling his shoulders. “Let’s make some damn friends.”



He strode over—not rushed, not too casual—just loose-limbed and warm, like he belonged wherever his feet landed.



“Morning,” he called, tilting his head in that easy way that said \*I’m harmless unless you’re boring.\* “You all lost, or just gathering intel on the enemy early?”



The group looked up, startled for a second—but the tension cracked immediately.



A short girl with spiky dark curls and a bandage on her left thumb raised a brow. “And who might \*you\* be, stranger?”



\---



\### ✦ The Crew



\*\*Spiky-haired girl:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Lani Huo  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 5’3”, athletic, sharp grin, cropped black curls, band-aids like they’re accessories  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Snarky, bold, easily entertained by chaos



\*\*Blonde with sun freckles:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Mara Tyne  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 5’7”, long blond braid, freckles across her nose, clear blue eyes  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Bright, open, sweet—and totally not prepared for Cael’s vibe



\*\*Soft-voiced boy with a charm ring:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Jules Emren  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 5’9”, soft curls, light brown skin, a glinting charm ring looped on one earlobe  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Warm, flirty, openly queer, confident in that \*tell-me-I’m-pretty\* way



\*\*Quiet girl with wide hazel eyes:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Revi Doss  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 5’6”, buttoned-up, wide-eyed, kind of giving 'don’t-look-at-me-until-I-talk' energy  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Thoughtful, slow to speak, deep once she opens up



\*\*Guy with undercut and boots:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Niko Vale  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 6’1”, buzzed sides, military-laced boots, cocky lean  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Chill, skeptical, but not unkind—observes before engaging



\*\*Girl with a lilac braid and holo-nails:\*\*  

\*\*Name:\*\* Talla Greaves  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 5’8”, glowing holo-polished nails, purple-tinted hair braid, expressive hands  

\*\*Personality:\*\* Flirty, chaotic, ready to adopt or ruin a man depending on the mood



\---



Cael gave them a slow smile, hands casually in his hoodie pockets.



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Name’s Cael Rowan. Human scholarship kid, former dock rat, full-time bad idea. You?”



That earned a laugh from Lani, a soft little giggle-snort from Mara, and an amused glance from Jules that definitely lingered a second longer than polite.



\*\*Mara\*\*: “Wait, \*the\* Cael Rowan? From Portside?”



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Oh no. My reputation got here before I did.” He mock-groaned. “I’ll never live that down.”



\*\*Talla\*\*: “Depends. If the stories are true, maybe we’ll \*make\* new ones.” She winked, tossing her braid back over her shoulder.



Cael blinked, caught somewhere between amusement and a very faint “oh no.”



\*\*Jules\*\* (grinning): “I like him already.”



\---



They fell into easy chatter.



\*\*Cael\*\* told them about the Port, vaguely mentioned his early arrival and a “weirdly huge dorm I didn’t ask for.” He didn’t name-drop Dino or Bee—just kept it light, like tasting a new current before diving in.



They traded names, quick backstories:



\- Lani wants to crack into \*Combat Systems\*, but mostly just wants to beat the arrogance out of everyone who underestimates her.

\- Jules is in \*Cultural & Linguistic Exchange\*, just like Bee—calls himself a “walking peace treaty with a wardrobe.”

\- Mara dreams of becoming an interspecies nurse, but swears she faints at \*needle insertion angles\*.

\- Revi barely speaks at first, but when asked, says her dream is to design new \*\*translation tech\*\* that bridges instinct, not just words.

\- Niko is gunning for \*Tactical Systems\* and makes a vague joke about “not wasting his upbringing.”

\- Talla says she’s “undecided, chaotic, and open to being corrupted by charming strangers,” while elbowing Cael with a grin.



\---



Somewhere in between snack-pouch comparisons and half-serious flexes about cafeteria food vs. dorm cooking, Cael complimented Mara’s earrings (“they catch the sun like you paid them to”) and offhandedly told Jules his charm ring was “the perfect kind of reckless.” He didn’t \*mean\* to flirt.



But... yeah.



\*\*Jules\*\* practically purred: “You’re dangerous, Cael. Keep talking.”



\*\*Talla\*\* fanned herself with mock drama. “I give it a week before he accidentally seduces a professor.”



\*\*Lani\*\*: “A \*week\*? Please. If the tech prof’s already chewing on sparks, it’s probably down to days.”



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Hey now—what happened to slow-burn friendships and academic bonding?”



\*\*Niko\*\* (dry): “That sounds fake but okay.”



Even Revi chuckled, soft and sudden.



\---



And yet—for all the teasing, it never tipped into discomfort. Just warmth, banter, a little buzz of energy Cael hadn’t realized he missed until now.



Something clicked with these six. Maybe not forever friends. But for now? A good current to ride.



He glanced at the time.



\*\*01:12 PM.\*\* Damn, had it been that long?



He slung his bag back onto his shoulder and grinned, stepping back from the group with a mock-salute.



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Alright, squad. I’ve got more corners to explore before the world starts spinning. But hey—thanks for the laughs.”



\*\*Jules\*\*: “Come find us later, Rowan. Seriously.”



\*\*Talla\*\*: “Or let \*us\* find you.”



\*\*Mara\*\*: “We’ll be around.”



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Hope so. You all have a great day. And hey—don’t let the Spire eat you alive.”



He turned, still smiling, and walked toward the far end of the courtyard—feeling lighter than he had in weeks.



Somewhere ahead, he spotted a familiar pattern of movement—graceful, measured, and just slightly more angular than human rhythm.



\*\*Vaelari.\*\*



And Cael, still coasting on warmth and laughter, adjusted his posture, centered his breath, and moved toward his next introduction.



\---



\*\*End of Part Two – 01:12 PM\*\*





\## ✴️ Chapter Five – “A New Day”  

\*\*Part Three: Careful Steps, Honest Words\*\*



Somewhere ahead, he spotted a familiar pattern of movement—graceful, measured, and just slightly more angular than human rhythm.



\*\*Vaelari.\*\*



And Cael, still coasting on warmth and laughter, adjusted his posture, centered his breath, and moved toward his next introduction.



He dropped his shoulders just slightly—open, but not casual. He eased his hands out of his pockets, let his arms hang loosely at his sides. Kept his pace steady, his steps quiet. No big gestures. No sudden moves. \*\*Posture respectful. Proximity measured.\*\*



As he approached, he nodded—not a bow, not a wave. Just enough.



“Good afternoon,” he said calmly. “I’m Cael Rowan. May I join you?”



\---



\### ✦ The Vaelari Circle



Eight figures stood loosely arranged beneath a shade structure formed by curved metallic petals. Each wore the academy's uniform, modified slightly with subtle sashes or crests denoting clan or academic lineage. All of them watched Cael the moment he entered their field of awareness—\*\*not hostile\*\*, but attentive.



One of the males stepped forward just half a pace. Older than the others by maybe a year or two, with silver-threaded markings running down the side of his neck.



\*\*Name:\*\* Kalen Virel  

\*\*Appearance:\*\* 6’6”, wiry-lean, braided dark-gold hair, eyes like polished bronze  

\*\*Role:\*\* Unspoken leader  

\*\*Energy:\*\* Diplomatic. Measured. Already categorizing Cael in three languages.



“Human Cadet Rowan,” Kalen said with a slight incline of the head. “You approach correctly. You may remain.”



Cael nodded back, holding a neutral stance with a relaxed spine. ""Appreciated.""



They adjusted their formation, giving him a semi-circle to stand at its outer edge. Not invited fully in—but \*recognized\*.



\---



\### ✦ The Others



\*\*Tesha Vaenri\*\* – 6'3"", pale fur with rust-colored highlights, a quiet voice and scholar's grace. She specialized in \*\*cross-species linguistics\*\* and carried herself like every word she chose could cut or cradle.  

\*\*Relo Tharn\*\* – 6'7"", built like a tower, with burn-scarred forearms and deep-set gray eyes. Quiet, not unfriendly—studying \*\*Tactical Systems\*\* and always calculating.  

\*\*Sivrin Ael\*\* – 6'2"", long platinum hair tied high, tail held with perfect poise. Known for \*\*Vaelari Ritual & Law\*\*. Spoke little, but \*watched\* like it was her duty.  

\*\*Vel Drakil\*\* – 6'5"", sharp-featured, casual in the way only someone born high could afford. Studying \*\*Combat & Diplomacy\*\*. Smirked like he was always half a second from a duel.

\*\*Jha’ren Vos\*\* – 6'8"", tail wrapped loosely at his side, gold piercings along one ear. Had a slow, almost musical voice—interested in \*\*Music Theory & Sonic Warfare\*\*.  

\*\*Meyli Thariel\*\* – 6'1"", shortest of the group, with wide dark eyes and an intense, elegant presence. Studying \*\*Bio-Memory Systems\*\*. Wore silence like armor.



\---



They exchanged names, academic tracks, and Vaelari-appropriate curiosities: not \*why are you here\*, but \*what will you contribute to this place, and to us?\*



\*\*Cael\*\* stood with easy posture, hands loosely clasped in front of him. When asked about his studies, he kept it simple.



“I’m here on a full scholarship,” he said. “Cultural integration and tactical engineering. Mostly? I want to be useful in places where people usually don’t look.”



\*\*Tesha\*\* tilted her head slightly. “A practical ambition.”



\*\*Jha’ren\*\*: “And a rare one. Most humans who approach this circle lead with bravado or uncertainty.”



Cael smiled softly. “I left both in my duffle bag.”



That earned a subtle flick of Vel’s tail and a quiet puff of amusement from Liraeth.



\---



\*\*Kalen\*\* gestured toward him—one small motion. “You are... uncommonly aware. Did you study our social models?”



“A bit,” Cael admitted. “But mostly, I paid attention.”



\*\*Meyli\*\* studied him, then finally spoke: “Attention is often a stronger bridge than translation.”



Her voice was soft, but it hit like a proverb.



\---



They asked more:



\*\*What do you want from your time here?\*\*



Cael didn’t hesitate. “To earn people’s trust. And maybe give back enough that someone else gets a chance like I did.”



That stopped them for a breath. Not shocked—but considering.



Then the harder topic came up, as it always did:



\*\*“You understand,” Kalen said carefully, “that closeness with Vaelari is not freely given. Even kindness must be measured to be safe.”\*\*



Cael nodded. “I know the rules. I also know I’ll screw something up eventually. But I’d rather learn \*with you\* than pretend to know more than I do.”



\*\*Sivrin\*\*: “Better an honest mistake than a dishonest bond.”



He grinned a little. “That sounds like something I should write down.”



\---



The tension didn’t disappear, but it... \*shifted\*. Several of them gave him brief nods. A few tails swayed in subtle, positive gestures. No one relaxed fully—but Cael had earned presence. And in a Vaelari circle, that was no small thing.



He took a small breath and straightened his stance, giving them each a final nod.



\*\*Cael\*\*: “Thanks for the time. I know it’s a bit unusual to show up and start talking, but I appreciate the welcome.”



\*\*Relo\*\*: “So far,” he said evenly, “you have done nothing to regret.”



Vel smirked. “Yet.”



Cael grinned. “I’ll try to keep it that way.”



\*\*Tesha\*\*: “We will observe.”



\*\*Cael\*\* (smiling): “Figured as much.”



\---



He stepped back the appropriate distance, offered a polite incline of his head once more, and turned to leave.



\*\*01:40 PM.\*\*



The sun had shifted slightly above the Spire’s curved skylights, and the warmth followed him as he walked. He rolled his shoulders, let out a long breath—and chuckled under it.



“That went better than expected.”



And just like that, his stomach reminded him it had been hours since breakfast.



Time to test the cafeteria.



\---



\*\*End of Part Three – 01:40 PM\*\*









\## ✴️ Chapter Five – “A New Day”  

\*\*Part Four: Spice, Slush, and Coming Home\*\*



\*\*01:40 PM.\*\*



The sun had shifted slightly above the Spire’s curved skylights, and the warmth followed him as he walked. He rolled his shoulders, let out a long breath—and chuckled under it.



“That went better than expected.”



And just like that, his stomach growled like it had been waiting for the conversation to end.



\*\*Time to test the cafeteria.\*\*



\---



By the time Cael made it to the main \*\*Cafeteria Atrium\*\*, it was \*\*02:00 PM\*\*, and the place was comfortably half-busy—enough noise to feel alive, not enough to overwhelm.



The space was massive. High ceilings. Modular tables. Adaptive lighting. Every zone of the cafeteria was clearly color-coded:  

\- \*\*Human fare\*\* marked in blue and green—more standard textures, protein blends, cultural familiarities.  

\- \*\*Vaelari nutrition arrays\*\* glowed soft amber and violet—aromatic vapors, layered temperature trays, dishes that pulsed lightly with heat regulation.  



Each station had a \*\*taste-safe sampling system\*\*—small, sterilized portions you could request in under ten seconds, no need to fully plate unless you liked what you tried.



Cael grinned like a kid sneaking into a market with stolen credits.



“Alright, Spire,” he muttered. “Let’s see what you’ve got.”



\---



\### ✦ Round One: Human Line



He started with the familiar—\*\*Earth-style meals\*\* first.



✦ \*Protein skewers with sour-spice glaze\* — “Mm. Good texture. Almost portside barbecue.”  

✦ \*Rehydrated potato skins with crisp garnish\* — “Tastes like my childhood. Sad, but kinda beautiful.”  

✦ \*Orange-fruit bubble fizz\* — “Whew. Okay. That one just punched me in the lungs.”



He went light. Bite here, sip there. Never more than a few mouthfuls. He wanted a \*\*map of flavor\*\*, not a nap from overeating.



\---



\### ✦ Round Two: Vaelari Selections



Here’s where things got \*weird\*—and in Cael’s book, weird was \*wonderful\*.



✦ \*Fermented stalks in cooled spice gel\* — “...Honestly? I’d eat this again. Not sure if it’s a snack or a war crime, but I like it.”  

✦ \*Tri-layer nutrient steam puff\* — “Texture of a dream, flavor of soap. Almost... meditative?”  

✦ \*Flash-fried vine rings dusted with grit sugar\* — “Holy stars, that’s \*dangerously\* good. Like spiced chips from the port, but evolved.”



He caught a few curious glances while sampling the Vaelari stuff—mostly from early arrivals like him. A few Vaelari students nearby flicked their ears in mild amusement at his muttered commentary, though no one interrupted.



One girl with silver-tipped fur gave him a slow blink when he looked up and nodded once, approvingly.



Cael returned the nod, lips quirking. \*Accepted by food. Not bad for day one.\*



\---



\### ✦ The “Coffee” Incident



At some point, curiosity won. He stepped up to a small auto-brew station that promised \*\*“Human-Style Wake Brew – Caf Equivalent”\*\*. The dispenser looked clean enough, but the scent…



Cael wrinkled his nose.



Still, he tapped a tasting portion—small cup, warm liquid, light foam.



He raised it to his mouth and sipped—



And immediately \*froze\*.



“...What the hell—”



It was like someone had \*\*taken brown sludge, whispered the word ‘coffee’ into it\*\*, and then drowned it in \*\*lukewarm dishwater\*\*.



He lowered the cup, blinking through betrayal.



“If Dino had this,” he muttered aloud, “he’d spit it out so hard it’d take paint off the walls.”



A few students near him turned and snorted with laughter—one guy even clapped softly in agreement.



Cael mock-saluted the machine. “Thanks for the trauma.”



He pushed the cup away like it might chase him.



\---



By \*\*03:14 PM\*\*, his tray was empty, his appetite satisfied—but more than that, he felt \*settled\*.



Not just full.



\*\*Centered.\*\*



Like the weight of the day—meeting new faces, stepping into new spaces—had finally settled into his bones in a way that didn’t ache.



He gathered his things, gave a short wave to the cafeteria staff, and stepped back into the corridor.



\---



The walk home was quieter than this morning’s explorations. Less wonder. More rhythm.



The campus moved around him—cadets training, students studying, machines cleaning in their endless, perfect loops. Somewhere, laughter echoed from a meditation garden. Someone played a strange wind instrument nearby, the notes folding into the air like drifting paper.



Cael just walked.



No rush. No nerves.



When he finally reached his dorm tower, climbed the familiar steps, and stood once more in front of the smooth, curved surface of his door—



He smiled.



The lock blinked, ready to scan him.



He didn’t rush.



Just stood there for a second. Let the feeling settle.



\*\*He belonged.\*\*



Even if just for now, he \*belonged\*.



\---



\*\*End of Chapter Five – 04:14 PM\*\*

Brief background: I only had one short relationship so not much experience. And I know for a fact that he’s single.

We share an open work space in a school setting, and he was always quiet and reserved. So I didn’t think much about him until one day we ran into each other outside of work. We both live near campus and our paths crossed couple of times while heading to work. During these brief interactions he was sweet and made small talk, and I thought we might become friends going forward. In our work setting, younger people like us are scarce, so I was looking forward to connecting with him more. 

Wrong! Whenever he sees me at work he ignores my “good-morning”s, “good-evening”s, small “hey”s when passing each other in the hallway, and even avoids being alone with me in the break room. One time he came in while I was making coffee, and he turned on his heels and walked out of the room after realizing I’m also there. It’s so frustrating!

Normally I would just ignore someone like him, but the weird part is, whenever I walk past him he makes eye contact and stares at me. Like, this guy who’s too lazy for a simple good morning somehow catches my eye and holds it every time I’m in his field of vision. Currently I try to avoid him whenever I’m passing by, but I can feel his eyes on me and I’m pretty sure I get all flushed in the face.

I wanted to ask him to lunch at some point, but I feel pretty dejected because of how much he avoids me at work. Worse, the more he ignores me the more my crush gets heavier. I just want to stop being too aware of him and go back to not minding him, but I feel this pull whenever we’re in the same space which is very often. I think he’s an introvert like me, but I never met someone this rigid.

Anyone with a similar experience? Should I try to befriend him or just try to let it go?",1,1744938013.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I just think it should be a widely available option for most sodas for those of us who want to abstain. Coffee has decaf, why not Dr. Pepper?",6,1744938010.0,self,4,0.69,False

I’m looking for a no-buy or minimal-buy accountability buddy — someone who’s trying to be more intentional about spending and wants to check in regularly to stay on track.

My personal goals:
	•	Stop impulse Amazon purchases
	•	Cut down on sweets, coffee, and pajama buying
	•	Use more of what I already have instead of feeling like I need something new

The idea is: if we get the urge to buy something, we check in with each other first. We can chat through the impulse and remind ourselves of our goals. I’m open to daily/weekly check-ins or just messaging when the urge hits!

If you’re interested, comment below with:
	•	Your no-buy / minimal-buy goals
	•	What time zone you’re in (I’m in Pacific Time)
	•	Your preferred way to check in (DM, Reddit chat, etc.)

Let’s support each other and make mindful spending a habit!

1k1slmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k1slmr/am_i_the_fool_here_you_decide/,Am I the Fool Here? You Decide!,"Since the very beginning, when I first met my ex, she used to invite me over to have cake with her and her friends. Some time passed, and we ended up doing a video call — but she didn’t want to show her face, she never did, always saying her hair was a mess. Later on, I found out she had autism, according to what she told me.

Our conversations were often pretty one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She also mentioned that I started treating her differently after she told me about her autism. She told me her ex had abandoned her, that she had been seeing another guy who left her for someone else.

One day, after I got mugged and nearly lost her number, I noticed how indifferent she was about it — she even said she wouldn’t text me unless I messaged her first. She used to talk about her cats and how her nephews were also on the autism spectrum. I remember she got really upset once when her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex.

Later on, I invited her to the movies because she had once said we’d probably never go out. At first, she said she wouldn’t go because she felt too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed — though the very next day she asked: ""Wouldn't it be better if we just stayed friends?""

Anyway, we did go to the movies, met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and spent the whole afternoon together, acting like a real couple. She never let me see her phone and was always distant in certain ways. She only gave me her Instagram after we had already broken up.

Another time, we went to the mall — she bought me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. Once there, she told me she was too shy and didn’t want the lights on. I told her it was fine, but her mood changed pretty quickly and she became distant. After that, we left and I took her home.

Before that, we’d gone to the park and acted all romantic again, and when it was time for her to head home, I offered to walk her back. It felt clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. I dropped her off and went back home.

There was also a day when her sister came to drop her off at my place, and I accidentally mentioned that we never went out because she was always making excuses. She got really mad at me that day.

One time, we were playing a game together, and when I criticized the game, she got upset and stopped playing. She brought me chocolate again, we spent some time together, and shortly after, she brought up breaking up.

She invited me to a party to go with her, then later said she wasn’t going, and then changed her mind again and said she would. I got upset and asked if she didn’t want me to go with her. I told her I’d show up and asked if I could come a bit earlier, but she made it very clear I should only arrive at 6 PM.

I arrived a little earlier anyway, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. Later, we went to a party hosted by one of her friends, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, during the party, she said: ""Should we download an app and find a hot girl for you?""

After the party, we went back to her place, and she wanted me to stay the night, but I ended up going home.

After all these ups and downs, I called her one day and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she said I had sent her to therapy (CAPS) and that I had taken away her happiness. Even after all that, she messaged me saying she missed me more than she thought she would.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me I should just find someone else. I got angry and questioned her, and she told me she was actually looking for her friend’s ex on the app.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said the feeling would pass, and mentioned she'd gone somewhere and wished I’d been there. Later, she called me and invited me to her mom’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mom even called me, asking if I loved her, and later invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but she told me her dad was furious with me, which made me feel awful. I vented online, and when she saw it, she accused me of deceiving and using her. She said she acted the way she did because of her insecurities and autism, that she prayed for me every day — and then she blocked me and disappeared.",1,1744937838.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False
