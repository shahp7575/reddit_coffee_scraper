Hey r/beermoney and passive income fam! 👋  

I’ve been testing out **Idle-Empire** for the past month, and honestly? It’s become my go-to for earning a little extra cash while barely lifting a finger. I’m averaging **$5-$10 daily** just by letting it run in the background or spending a few minutes here and there. Let me break it down for you!  

### **What Is Idle-Empire?**  
It’s a legit rewards platform where you earn points by:  
- 🎮 **Playing mobile games** (yes, actual fun ones!)

- 📺 Watching ads or videos  
- 💰 Even *mining crypto* passively (optional)  

Points convert to **PayPal cash, Amazon gift cards, Bitcoin**, and more. Payouts start as low as $0.50, so you’re not waiting forever to cash out.  

### **Why I’m Hooked**  
- **Zero upfront cost** – completely free.  
- **Works globally** (most features available worldwide).  
- **Passive options**: The crypto miner runs quietly, and you earn while sleeping.  
- **Daily login bonuses** – free points just for opening the app.  

### **How I Earn $5-$10 Daily**  
I combine a few methods:  
1. **Complete 2-3 surveys** during coffee breaks (≈20 mins).  
2. Let the **crypto miner** run overnight (earns ≈$2-3/day alone).  
3. Grab quick points from **daily rewards** and mini-tasks.  

It’s not a “get rich” app, but it’s perfect for consistent side cash. 💸

- Cash out via PayPal for instant transfers.

For all our entries, we had to specify the bite and sweetness of each brew, so we made some note cards for folks to mark down their thoughts on a scale from 1-5. We had some clear favorites, and a mead that got only 1s & 2s in the overall score.

This was a super nice way to get more objective feedback on how our mead turned out. Other people must feel this sometimes where you’re not sure if your friends actually liked your brew or if they’re just being nice, so giving them the task to score them a little objectively made it a little more engaging.

# Hydro Flask Replacement Lid: 2025's BEST Options Compared & Reviewed!

is your trusty Hydro Flask missing a lid? Did it crack after that unexpected tumble down the hiking trail? Or maybe you’re simply looking to upgrade to a more convenient style? You're not alone. A hydro Flask is a important investment, and a lost or broken lid shouldn't render your favourite water bottle useless. Finding the right hydro flask replacement lid can breathe new life into your beloved bottle, and this guide is designed to help you navigate the often-overwhelming world of replacement lids.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the best hydro flask replacement lid options available in 2025, covering everything from different lid types and compatibility to where to find them and how to choose the perfect one for your needs. Whether you're seeking a hydro flask straw lid replacement, a hydro flask flex cap replacement, or simply trying to figure out what hydro flask lid sizes will fit your bottle, we’ve got you covered.## Why replace your Hydro Flask Lid?

Before we dive into the options, let's quickly address *why* a replacement lid is so vital. Beyond the obvious (keeping your beverage contained!), a good lid is crucial for:

   **Maintaining Temperature:** Hydro Flasks are renowned for their insulation. A damaged or incorrect lid can compromise this,leading to lukewarm water or quickly melting ice.
   **Preventing Leaks:** Nobody wants a soggy backpack or a water-logged car seat. A leak-proof hydro flask lid is essential for mess-free hydration on the go.
*   **Hygiene:** A cracked or damaged lid can harbor bacteria and become tough to clean, potentially affecting your health.*   **Convenience:** The right lid can considerably improve your drinking experience, whether it's a straw lid for effortless sipping or a flip lid for quick access.   **Sustainability:** Replacing just the lid is far more enduring than buying a whole new bottle.

These needs are at the core of why people seek out a new lid. From the active hiker to the environmentally conscious commuter, the perfect replacement lid restores functionality and peace of mind.And if your hydro flask lid broke, leaked, or cracked, know that a replacement is a much better option than a full replacement!

## Understanding Your Hydro Flask and Lid Needs

Before shopping for a new hydro flask replacement lid, consider these key factors:

   **Hydro Flask Size:** This is the most crucial factor. Lids aren't universally sized. Are you rocking an 18 oz, 24 oz, 32 oz, or 40 oz Hydro Flask? Knowing your bottle's size ensures a proper fit. You might even need to check your bottles if you own various sizes and accidentally mix-matched lids.
*   **Mouth type:** Hydro Flasks come in two primary mouth types: wide mouth and standard mouth. A hydro flask wide mouth lid will *not fit a standard mouth bottle, and vice versa. Many users actively search for a hydro flask lid replacement wide mouth or hydro flask lid replacement standard mouth to make sure they end up with the right one.
   **Desired Lid Functionality:** What kind of drinking experience are you after? Do you prefer sipping through a straw, chugging from a spout, or taking slow sips from a customary lid? Knowing this will help you narrow down your choices.
   **Materials:** Do you prefer a hydro flask lid stainless steel for durability,or are you okay with a BPA-free hydro flask lid plastic option? Think about your priorities.

these are questions you should answer before going in to buy hydro flask lid!

1jferdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jferdr/same_time_every_year_same_guy/,Same time every year. Same guy.,"Last year, I (19F), went for coffee after college with my friend. As we left the coffee shop to go for a walk we passed the greggs. 
Usually no one sits outside February time but that day there was this guy. Omfg he was so good looking. He had super intense eyes and long dark hair he had up in a man bun. We locked eyes for a second and I looked away.
Usually I’m very confident but I weighed a lot back then due to my depression after basically being held hostage by my ex boyfriend for almost 7months. 
So my self esteem was quite low. However despite putting on weight I never gained weight on my face which was great so I was still gorgeous plus it wasn’t like I was obese. However for me, I felt huge since I had such a tiny frame.

ANYWAYYYY (sorry I got mad autism and I ramble).

I couldn’t pass up on this guy. Everything about him seemed meant for me and the way I felt when we locked eyes was something you only hear about in a book. Everytime I sneaked a peak at me he was still looking at me. As I went round the corner with my friend he looked down at his steak bake and smiled.
Crazy.
After a very girly debrief I sent my friend to go back and ask for his number. Like I said he has VERY intense eyes and she got scared and aborted mission.

DID I MENTION THIS GUY HAS A MOTORCYCLE.
He is like the epitome of cool:

Man bun
Olive skin
Dark hazel eyes
Motorcycle 
Leather jacket

Like I’d have his babies right now. Kidding(ish)

Me and my pal continued wandering round town and I made eye contact with him a few more times but I couldn’t work up the courage to face the possibility of rejection. 
Eventually he met up with his group and he gave one last look as he went up the stairs to the car park I gave him a lil wave and he waved his helmet while turning his back to me.

It should stop there right?

No.

I ran round to the other side of the car park and watched him and his friends stand by their vehicles, probably discussing where they were heading next. He looked to cool with his helmet on, bruh.
My friend told me he was gonna think I was crazy if he spotted me watching but I just wanted to see his face for possibly the last time. + when he did see me he freaking waved!!!!
And then got in his motorcycle and left.

I’m a musician and after that day I composed an entire arrangement for him and posted it.
Every evening at the same time I would go into town in hopes of meeting him again. Yet he was never there.
A few weeks went by and my infatuation never died. One day after a couple solo drinks at spoons I walk past the car park and see him putting on his helmet.

You probably think “this is the part she stops yapping and says she got his number.” 
NO.

I just stood under the entry to the car park and let him mount his bike and drive away, like a fool.

I never saw him again for the rest of the year and thought I scared him off with my stalking. 

But the same time this year , a couple weeks ago I was waiting for the bus to go to college.
I’m stood under the bus shelter checking the times. The rain is heavy and the wind is icey. Suddenly I see a helmet and leather jacket pass me and inside that helmet sat the most intense eyes known to mankind. Two eyes I had thought about daily for the past 365 days. It was motorcycle guy.
I’m still shocked I even saw him and even more shocked that he saw me first. He walked round the corner and I continued waiting for my bus. And when he came back round he saw me again and nodded at me and crossed the road to get on his bike.
I literally forgot to breathe out of shock.
For no reason at all that day I decided to wear this sick ass fit and I KNOW he was impressed. I literally looked like I was made to sit on the back off his bike and ride off into the sunset with him.

I haven’t see him in town since.

(Also don’t know if I mentioned this but it’s a small town and not too many people stand out so I should’ve seen him again by now.)

Last night I went to the 2hollis Glasgow concert. He was there. I think. Dark eyes but the hair was shorter. The only reason I think it was him is because it was the same look. The way only the motorcycle guy has ever looked at me and he looked happy to see me. It was loud and I’m short and lights were flashing and mosh pits were everywhere but somehow he ended up next me holding onto me during the chaos. Next second one of my friends pulled me and I never saw him again through the sea of the endless sweaty shoulders possessed by the twinks of the 2hollis fandom. Man, 2hollis people are so tall.

Anyway guys I feel like I’m limited to  two chances a year with guy as it’s such a crazy coincidence I see the same time every year. Then again it’s only happened twice. We’ll see what happens next year.
I’ve never even heard his voice and yet I miss him forever. Do you think we’re fated or I should probably start going to therapy?

Filming it helped me slow down and pay attention to the little things. Plus, there’s something kinda peaceful about capturing those quiet moments before the day really starts.

Lately, I’ve been sharing these short videos, not because I think I’m some kind of coffee expert (far from it), but more to share the simple joy of the process. There’s something almost meditative about watching the bloom or the steam rising off a fresh cup. If you’re curious, here’s today’s little ritual. No talking, no frills — just coffee.

Here's My Report.,"I started renting this house a few weeks ago. It was a nice 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house with a 2 car garage and a sizable driveway. The grass was in very good health, and the wooden fence was always painted a very bright and clean shade of white every few weeks. It was like a house from the 50s because it was. There was something charming about it, the wooden paneling, the porch with the backyard deck, the grill, the cozy little shack out back full of tools, and the lawnmower. I was allowed to rent this out for as long as I needed so I could write a report about a murder. One thing happened in this very house, in fact. Back in the 60s, a couple lived here, they were crazy about each other. And about some of the neighbors as well. For over 2 decades, they poisoned, stabbed, and shot various other families. It was never clear why they did it or what motives they had.

In the very end, it was chalked up as pure insanity, a pair of psychopaths married together. They had a son and daughter, but the grandparents had taken them out of that household after finding out about the first murder. They kept quiet. This house has been turned into a sort of museum and rental space over the past few years. It was closed off to the public for over 3 decades but recently opened back up for people to look at. Turns out that renting out and giving tours of a haunted house was profitable.

Oh, I forgot to mention that it was haunted by the souls of the couple who killed those families back in the day. This was something I was having a hard time documenting in the report I was writing. I mean, come on, a haunted house? What the hell is this, a horror novel? I was dead wrong about it, though. It all started one night when this one song started playing on a phonograph in the living room. It was Put Your Head On My Shoulder by Paul Anka. I can't get it out of my head. It played over and over every night.

The nights would go the same way over and over. I would go to bed at around 10 PM. After that, the house would fall into an odd silence. The lights came on in the living room, and that song would start playing itself. The movement of footsteps could be heard as they creaked against the hardwood floors.

""Please, come out and join us. It's quite a fine night."", a female voice would call out.

""Come now, be our guest, and take a seat out here. We'll drink tea and listen to the radio."", a male voice would soon follow up with the woman's voice.

It was not safe to get up and check it out, despite their words of assurance. Doing so could bring unknown results. It may have been safe, but something in my body told me otherwise. I would stay in bed until 6 AM; that's the time everything would fade away and turn to normal. Their little dance and music would go on all night, but I would still be able to sleep. While dozing off, it seems like the music would go silent despite still playing. I guess their only goal at first is to draw you out.

It's been a few days of this before things took a step up. I've been hearing...people? It's almost like a party happened during the night hours. Again, I find that I cease to hear it once I fall asleep. I guess these little events are mere attempts at giving incentives for me to leave the room rather than to torture me. Although every so often there'll be a knock on the door asking me to come out. It only lasts a second before the person walks away. They're very polite about it, though, and they don't stick around. merely ask me and then vanish once they don't hear an answer in 5 seconds.

During the daytime, I've been logging this information into my reports. I feel like I'm going slightly insane; these can't be real, right? I must be breathing some sort of hallucinogenic gas being pumped in here. Got the vents checked out, and there's nothing wrong with them. They did need to be cleaned, though, so at least I had an excuse to get them worked on without looking like a crazy person. I never find a trace of this couple during the day. No shoes, footprints, altered objects, nothing. Not a single thing moved out of place or touched. Hell, things seem slightly cleaner in the morning. It may be the fact that I try to keep things as they are, though.

I spend my days walking around the neighborhood. The people living around here are mostly millennials. The ones who either inherited these houses and chose to rent them out or live in them instead of selling them. Or renting them to cut down certain parts of the mortgage. I drive into the city and head to a coffee shop I like for a few hours. I leech off the free wifi so I can get my things done. There's free wifi at the house, but it's a gamble on the speeds and connection. I also like starting my day off with coffee and going about my hours getting cake and a few sandwiches.

It's now week 3, and I'm almost done. I was given 4 weeks before the deadline to make a report on this house so the people I work for can get some info. They're not exactly well informed since most of the people have either died, ""killed themselves"", or simply walked out after a few days. The only reason I've survived this long is that I read every last bit of data I could from both historical records and the half-assed papers people put together before throwing their badges to the side and working for another newspaper. I'm barely getting anything interesting so far, aside from the fever dream of a stay I'm getting from this place.

These days during the third week have been weird. I wake up at the same time only to hear humming. I'm hearing musical humming, no particular song, just random notes. This is the wife humming while making some sort of breakfast. Her name is Rose, and her husband is Clark. Can't believe I've been referring to them as the husband and the wife all this time. It changes during these days, but it ranges from bacon and eggs to cereal and orange juice with toast to a full pancake breakfast. They got bigger and bigger every day. On day one, I stayed in my room until the humming stopped. Only lasted for about 15-20 minutes. After that, I would check the kitchen to find a freshly cooked breakfast. Rose wasn't anywhere in sight, though.

I was hesitant to eat it at first since I wasn't sure what would happen. But I was hungry that morning and didn't feel like making the drive to the city so early in the morning. The food was good, and I didn't feel poisoned or anything. I would set the dishes in the sink and take a shower. Not even 15 minutes after getting out of the shower and getting dressed, the dishes were washed, dried, and sitting in the cupboards. I'm honestly not sure why people have been dying or quitting this trip. So far, I've stayed out of their way and never really messed with anything. I feel like a guest here and act as one, which is probably the key here. You can't live here, merely stay for a certain amount of time. I don't know how long that time frame is, though.

Week 4: These last 7 days are my final chances to wrap this up before the deadline. I am nowhere closer to finding out how these past journalists died, why this couple did what they did, or anything like that. The best I'm going to do is probably pump out a short guide on how not to die here. This week was the hardest. The haunting extends all day. You see, the morning would start off as normal like last week. Waking up, hearing the humming, waiting for it to stop, eating breakfast, putting the dishes in the sink, etc. The real difference is that they are now visible and active all day and night.

Clark spends his day sitting on an armchair reading a newspaper, The funny detail is that the date of the newspaper follows our date, only the month and day, not the year. He is always in a white dress shirt with the top button left undone. Simple ironed black dress pants with a leather belt neatly wrapped around them. Brown leather shoes, more like loafers actually. The kind of dress shoes you slip on. They were always shined and clean. His right leg is on the floor with his left leg stretched over his right. The newspaper covered his face. The only thing that could be seen from the other side was the occasional cigarette smoke.

The cigarette never had a scent though, phantom tobacco, funny. Rose would be sitting on the couch most of the time, either knitting, reading a magazine, or watching TV. It was a large black and white tv, the outside made of hardwood, the thick glass of the display, and the antenna sticking out of the top. Can't miss those two large dials on it. There was always something different on TV; one moment it was a cooking show, the news, and even a Western movie. The volume was always able to be heard but was sort of faint as well. It's a sort of background noise you barely notice after a while.

It was not a good idea to verbally or physically interact with them in any way. Not even looking at them was an option. I've never seen either of their face outside of photos because I'm always staring at my phone or laptop, even intentionally staring at the floor. The carpet was very pleasant to look at. They never spoke during the day. Rose would sometimes clean the house. Sometimes dusting, vacuuming, and even washing the dishes. I lied. I've caught small glimpses of their faces from reflections. They are in their young age from the 60s, the prime of their life right before the major kill streak.

I can't even explain any of this. This house could slowly be turning into a self-contained instance of time. But that wouldn't make sense since the wifi here works, my money is up to date, and my tech can be charged. A few of the outlets were swapped out for more modern ones. Only the ones not already connected to appliances or the TV itself. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner would always appear on the table at different times of the day. Breakfast at 6 AM, lunch at noon, and dinner at 6 PM. I would always eat in silence and put the dishes in the sink. I've tried rinsing the dishes before at least but the water never touched them. I don't know how to explain it, but I would turn on the water and it would just phase through the dishware. I gave up after one day.

Well, this is the final day. I'll be scheduling this report to send itself in a few hours. I don't even want to do it manually since I'm rinsing my hands off this worthless paperwork once I leave. There was one thing I wanted to check out, though. I'm going to continue this bit on my phone.

I always wanted to check out the basement. I forgot that it even existed this whole time. The door wasn't blocked or locked at all luckily. The door opened just fine, but the lightbulb turned on for about a second before blowing out. It didn't actually explode, but the light sort of just flashed and burned out like a flashbang. The steps are quite loud as they creak. I'm not sure what this smell is, it's like a mixture of gas and...rotten meat?

The door just closed by itself, and the only light I have down here is from my phone flashlight. There's some kind of red puddle leading to a room down here. I'm not liking it. I'm writing this live so my boss can read it. Yes, I know, it's hard to believe I'm actually being productive.

This...this is blood. There's a body in here. No, wait, multiple bodies down here. I can see dozens or even hundreds of flies just covering these bodies. I think I recognize some of the badges around the necks. All of these bodies smell fresh. Is time frozen down here or something?

...shit. There are footsteps coming down here. I'm squeezed behind a broken-down fridge; perhaps Clark will just give up his search in a few minutes. My 911 alert just failed. This one message will probably be the last thing that'll automatically upload. I think I just made a horrible mistake. I wasn't supposed to come down here.

I recently got to rent out a home from the '60s. This house is famous because of a couple that used to live here from the 60s to the 80s. They were known for killing people and families during this time period before finally being caught by the police. These were the things I learned during my stay in this house:

\- During the first week there will be dancing. From 10 PM to 6 AM there will be activity in the living room. The couple will appear out there and dance to a song called Put Your Head On My Shoulder along with a few others.

\- They will assure you that it's fine to come out and join them. Don't do it. I've never attempted it, so I don't know if anything will happen, but trust your gut.

\- During week 2, they will start hosting a ""party"". The sound of many people will come from the living room as if people have come over for the evening. Every few hours the door will knock as someone on the other end will invite you to join everyone.

\- During week 3, the haunting will break into the day. During the morning, the wife will be in the kitchen making breakfast; do not leave your room until she is done. You can use the bathroom, but just don't look or enter the kitchen. You will hear her humming for about 20 minutes. Once it stops, you can go about your day. The food is perfectly fine to eat and is actually encouraged. Make sure you put your dishes in the sink.

\- During week 4, if you've survived this long, they will roam the house 24/7. Do not make eye contact with either of them. They'll mainly stay in the living room. The husband is sitting on the armchair reading a newspaper, and the wife is reading a magazine or knitting. Occasionally, she'll clean the house. If you are going to be in the living room, keep your eyes low, and do not verbally interact with them.

\- If you do...I'm not sure. There have been reports of them killing people during this time. Acting hostile at them or trying to kill them will not end well. Many have rented this place out, and almost all of them have died. Some were filled with stab wounds, some were in the tub, drowned, and others were framed as if it were suicide. You may wonder why the government hasn't merely torn the house down. I'm not sure. It seems like the money they make from this place keeps it running longer.

\- They will not force themselves into the room during the night. Unless you interact with them, they will not attack or come your way. Any food or snacks prepared is fully safe and encouraged to consume. Make sure you set dishes and silverware in the sink. They'll be cleaned when you're not working. Staying outside of the house is your best chance to live. Follow these rules.",6,1742437300.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

The year I spent in an LDR last year causes me existential dread and kept me in a loop of a banal existence, but I know this LDR would be handled better and offer more opportunities for visits. I can't decide if ""really great"" is good enough to put myself through another year of waiting, when I've been ""waiting"" for my life to start for the past 3 years of my 20s and I get nauseous even thinking about it. Does it make sense to pursue this relationship?

I've been wanting to move out of Houston since I moved here almost 3 years ago. I'll be moving to NYC, where I have friends and family, and where I want to make a fresh start. I have very few friends in Houston, and my social life is basically a whisper as a result. I have an overwhelming need to start new, discover my passions, and put my whole self into a brand new life.

Another piece of background: In May, my long term long distance relationship ended after almost a year of long distance where I had prepared to make the sacrifice and move up to the person I thought was the one. It was a miserable year spent lonely and held together solely by the hope of finally moving in with her.

Back in August, I started dating this girl. She and I hit it off right away, and I found that more things clicked as the time went on. I broke things off in October just before the girlfriend talk, because I was actively searching for jobs that could move me to NYC, and I was so broken down from the long distance I had endured before that I didn't want to waste another year waiting for something that might never arrive. This past week I reached back out to ask if she wanted to get coffee and catch up, and we unexpectedly felt even more connected than our last date.

We have a ton of overlap in music taste, senses of humor, interest in hiking and traveling, and ways we flirt and show affection. We also have similar views on kids, religion, politics, and a lot of that core stuff. She's my type as well, so she truly checks every box. The only feeling of doubt I have is that occasionally we aren't perfectly in sync in the way I've felt in that prior relationship, but I know that that comes from spending time together and developing that perfect back and forth. Essentially, if I wasn't moving, she'd be my girlfriend.

But I am. I am moving explicitly to cut the weight of my current state and live the life I've always wanted that I was missing out on in my prime years. I get sick thinking about how much time I've spent waiting around to finally be able to pursue things with my whole heart, and I want nothing more than to try and fail and try again at my passions. She wouldn't prevent me from pursuing my passions, but I would be waiting yet again for life to finally fall into place, planning around this other person, and doing it all on a hope that she's the one.

The counter arguments are that she's a far better communicator than my last LDR, we'd be able to fly to each other for a full week at a time since we work from home, and best of all, she'd happily move to NYC once her current lease is up in March.

The voice inside my head is constantly arguing with itself and flip flops like a senator in an election year, screaming ""just try it out and see, and then if it works out you'll be with an awesome person! People like that don't just grow on trees!"", then 10 minutes later screaming ""you cannot hold onto a person you're not certain about just so that you can avoid having to feel like you missed out, you're going to be a man in his prime in a city of 8 million people, and if you hold on to feelings from this old life, you won't be able to start completely fresh and figure out what it is that makes you truly happy outside of the humor and affirmation and affection of a significant other.""

Those voices won't shut up and I'd really like them to! Any advice would be extremely appreciated!",2,1742437113.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Usually whenever I sleep for two hours in the evening, I wont be able to sleep at night till 2 am. I am not really an all nighter. My parents would never let me be awake after 10 or 11 unless I have slept in the evening. I don't drink coffee or tea either. 

So the thing is, I slept for two hours yesterday so that I could study for chem at night(I have done this before). BUT, the moment I opened the book, I couldn't keep my eyes open. It wasn't like any normal drowsiness. It was literally hell. My eyes were hurting a lot, my head had a bad headache and it felt super heavy. 

So, i went to bed.

Woke up at 4 this morning without an alarm or anyone to wake me up. Came and sat down for chem. And AGAIN, this drowsiness came in. My mom told me to just go and sleep so I slept till seven. My head still hurts a bit. 

I don't know why my head is hurting a lot. I remember this the same way it hurt all night, keeping me awake, just before history. And I made a lot careless mistakes in history because I lost an entire night's sleep. And then this headache was there for geo, physics, and p.ed aswell. I don't know what is the reason. I sleep like 7-8 hours during the study leaves and around 6-7 hours the night before the exams.

To a great degree of certainty

That there will be orange leaves this fall.

They will probably rain over Granville, Ohio,
Like confetti,

Tuning the sidewalk that leads to the library

Into crunchy paradise.



The café next to my job

Will smell like coffee

And caramel,

And the cool breeze will carry the scent into open windows.


I’ve always loved unexpected guests.


On an early summer's night,

I close my eyes while walking home,

Stepping across a leafless sidewalk.


For the first time

In a long time,

I can’t picture the maple trees

Or the taste of coffee.


If I don’t make it there,

Someone else will still carve the pumpkins poorly.

Maybe they will think of me, and maybe they won’t.

It doesn’t matter.

The leaves will still be whatever color they are in the fall,

The sidewalk will still feel like stone,

And the brick building next to the brick building will still smell however brick buildings smell.


No one will be there to see them anyway

Im a PV2/PFC at the time, and had  just finished my CQ shift. Now I am heading back to my room in our camp Casey barracks. I don't even bother showering I just get in my pajamas and hop into bed as soon as I enter my room. Now I share the room with another soldier named Briggs. Yes... that Briggs. The ""Coffee turns your stomach into leather"" Briggs. For those that have been to the barracks in south Korea, they're small rooms. One bed next to another almost within arms reach. 

Anyways, I'm just about to fall asleep when I hear a ruffling of bed sheets from Briggs's side of the room. I look over and this man is just cranking away. Thankfully he had his bed sheets over him but this mothercucker was absolutely going to pound town on himself. I call out to him, to tell him to stop. This dude has his headphones in and  absolutely cannot hear me nor see me. He is absolutely Lazer focused on whatever debauchery he his cranking away at. Now I'm getting pissed. One of the unwritten rules is, if you're cranking away you have got to either go in the bathroom or at least wait until someone leaves. Briggs didn't care. I'm about to get up and leave when this dude just stops, tenses up and says ""Hooaaaahhhh."" and then rolls over, falling asleep immediately.

I was absolutely flabbergasted. This jackass just said Hooah after beating the meat. Un-funking believable. I was so dumbfounded that I left my key card in my room while leaving. I went to the DFAC and basically waited all day in the barracks for his ass to get back to let me in, because I didn't want to deal with asking CQ at the time.

For those residing in Arkansas, it's an excellent way to unearth and trade items locally without the inconvenience of shipping or travel. If you're interested in acquiring or vending something in Arkansas, Craigslist is the place to be.\
\
In this comprehensive handbook to Craigslist Arkansas items on sale by owner, we'll encompass everything you require to comprehend about utilizing the platform effectively. From authoring a listing that captures attention to bargaining for a fair price, we'll guide you through every single step of the procedure. Whether you're a practiced Craigslist user or a newbie, this guide has something for everyone.\
\
Comprehending Craigslist Arkansas\
\
Craigslist is a website that permits users to post classified ads for a wide array of commodities and amenities. It's sorted into diverse categories, making it effortless to unearth what you're searching for. The ""For Sale"" section is one of the most sought-after categories, and it's where you'll come upon listings for everything from vehicles and furnishings to electronics and household items.\
\
One of the primary traits of Craigslist is that it's arranged by location, so you can find items on sale near your current location. In Arkansas, there are several specific Craigslist sites that cover different regions of the state, encompassing Little Rock, Fayetteville, Fort Smith, and more. This makes it uncomplicated to find items on sale in your local vicinity without the necessity to sift through listings in other parts of the state.\
\
Devising a Persuasive Listing\
\
If you're contemplating selling something on Craigslist Arkansas, the fundamental step is formulating a compelling listing that will lure potential purchasers. The headline of your listing is the initial thing users will spot, so it's imperative to make it descriptive and attention-grabbing. For instance, instead of merely stating ""Car for Sale,"" you could inscribe ""2015 Toyota Corolla in Excellent Condition - Must See!""\
\
When it comes to the listing itself, the more minutiae, the better. Ensure to include a lucid and precise portrayal of the item you're vending, including any relevant details such as the make, model, condition, and price. High-quality images are also crucial for seizing the interest of potential purchasers, so be certain to include several explicit photographs that exhibit your item from numerous perspectives.\
\
Selecting the Correct Category\
\
Once you've concocted a compelling listing, the subsequent step is picking the suitable category for your item. Craigslist Arkansas has a broad spectrum of categories to pick from, so it's critical to select the one that best aligns with the item you're vending. For example, if you're selling a vehicle, you'll want to list it in the ""Cars & Trucks"" category. If you're selling furnishings, the ""Furniture"" category is the spot to be.\
\
By selecting the correct category, you'll guarantee that your listing is sighted by the suitable audience. This can assist you in drawing more potential purchasers and intensifying your likelihood of making a sale. If you're unsure which category is the best fit for your item, take a gander at similar listings on Craigslist to ascertain where others have posted analogous items.\
\
Determining a Fair Price\
\
Pricing your item competitively is vital for attracting potential purchasers on Craigslist Arkansas. It's crucial to conduct some research to acquire a notion of what similar items are vending for in your area. Peruse other listings on Craigslist, in addition to other online marketplaces and local stores, to get an inkling of the prevailing rate for your item.\
\
Once you have an idea of the market value for your item, you can set a competitive price for your listing. Bear in mind that Craigslist users are often seeking a good bargain, so pricing your item marginally below market value can aid in alluring more interest. Nonetheless, it's also imperative to set a price that's equitable to you as the vendor, so be sure to take your own expenses and desired profit margin into account when setting your price.\
\
Engaging with Buyers\
\
When you list an item for sale on Craigslist Arkansas, it's probable that you'll receive some propositions from potential purchasers. It's critical to be prepared to engage in negotiations with these purchasers to arrive at a fair price for both parties. Bear in mind that many Craigslist users are searching for a great bargain, so it's customary for purchasers to attempt to negotiate the price downwards.\
\
When engaging in negotiations with potential purchasers, it's crucial to be resolute but adaptable. Be primed to make some concessions if it leads to making a sale, but also be unequivocal about your lowest acceptable price. It's also wise to be candid and transparent with potential purchasers about the condition of the item and any imperfections or issues it may possess.\
\
Safety Guidelines for Purchasers and Vendors\
\
While Craigslist can be a splendid avenue to procure and vend items in Arkansas, it's essential to bear safety in mind when utilizing the platform. Whether you're a purchaser or a vendor, it's imperative to take precautions to safeguard yourself and your possessions.\
\
For purchasers, it's crucial to exercise prudence when meeting with vendors in person. Always meet in a public place, such as a coffee shop or shopping center, and bring a friend along if feasible. It's also a good notion to meticulously inspect the item before making a purchase to ensure that it's in the condition you anticipate.\
\
For vendors, it's critical to take measures to safeguard your privacy and security. Refrain from divulging personal information such as your home address or phone number with potential purchasers until you feel at ease doing so. It's also a prudent idea to have someone else present when meeting with potential purchasers, especially if you're showcasing the item at your home.\
\
To Conclude\
\
Craigslist Arkansas is an invaluable resource for purchasing and selling items in the local community. Whether you're seeking to generate some additional revenue by vending unwanted items or unearth a fantastic deal on something you require, Craigslist has something for everyone. By adhering to the tips and guidance in this ultimate guide, you can maximize your experience on Craigslist Arkansas and have a flourishing and secure buying or selling experience.\

    An explanation of Saint Paul’s meaning of Romans  7:14-7:23
 
    Romans 7:14-23 is a passage from Saint Paul’s letter to the Romans. This essay will explain Saint Paul’s meaning in this passage. Additionally, this essay will discuss the passages theological significance particularly as it relates to Original Sin and the Lenten season. Furthermore, this essay will discuss the struggle between the mind and flesh. Moreover, the essay will conclude with a discussion regarding this passage’s application to Christians living during ordinary time.
   The passage describes Saint Paul’s conversion to following Christ and the internal struggle between a need to follow the new covenant and the attractiveness of sin. Saint Paul acknowledges that God’s law is inherently good, by saying “ the law is spiritual” (Romans 7:14). Paul discusses the dichotomy between the goodness of God’s law and his struggle with the human condition. This is displayed when Paul writes that he is “ Sold as a slave to sin” (Romans 7:14). By using this phrase Paul acknowledges that sin has immense power over him and is ingrained in human nature. In this way Paul is pointing his reader to the effect of Original Sin. Paul relates this to his own struggles by sharing that he desires to do what is good which in this context means following God’s law.  
   On the other hand, he shares that he ends up taking parts in things that he “hates”, which are actions that go against God’s law. He highlights this moral struggle by sharing that although he undoubtedly agrees with God’s law on an intellectual level, he has difficulty following it and blames this shortcoming on sin that is within him (Romans7:17). This is possibly a reference to Original Sin and the “gift of free will”. In relation to the struggle surrounding the conflict between the mind and flesh Saint Paul admits that nothing righteous is able to live within him without God’s law (Romans 7:18-20). By making this assertion Paul points out that willpower is not enough and we must rely on God’s law and the Holy Spirit in order to maintain on Righteousness. This is done through prayer. The importance of prayer is further spelled out in Catechism of the Catholic Church. Beginning in section 2590 where it states “prayer is the raising of one’s mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God” (CCC 2590).
   This relationship between God’s earthly people and himself is arguably most tested during Lent. This is the Holiest time in the Christian calendar .and culminates in the celebration of Christ’s resurrection. During this time Christians traditionally participate in periods of prayer  fasting and alms giving. Furthermore, as it relates to fasting Christians will often give up foods or habits that they feel separate them from God including coffee, chocolate, meat, television, smoking etc. This is where the battle between willpower and Holy Spirit is most often at play. For example, if an individual who is Christian decides to give up smoking for Lent and relies only on willpower they will most certainly fail. In order to succeed with this forty-day Lenten fast and or break the habit entirely they must submit themselves to God through prayer. Additionally, the battle for faithfulness is also something that is pervasive throughout the Bible beginning with the prayer of Abraham and Jacob as discussed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church section 2592.
   With regard to theological significance (Romans 7:14-23) brings to the forefront the idea of absolute worldly possession meaning that worldly things such as the human disposition are inherently sinful, and no one can achieve full righteousness without total submission to Christ and his law. In applying this passage to Christian living Paul acknowledges that struggling with sin is an unfortunate reality of the human condition. He points those he is trying to convert , in this case the Roman people rely on the knowledge of the need of Christ in order to overcome sin. This is something that modern Christians can apply to themselves not only during Lent but during ordinary times as well. Furthermore, this passage highlights the idea that faith is not linear and should not be discouraged if they fall back to sin but turn to Christ as he has done  and take strength from the Holy Spirit.
  The passage discussed throughout this essay as an effective representation of humans’ struggle with sin and as Paul points out in order to fully overcome sin one must put all of their hope and trust in Jesus Christ alone. Saint Paul should be an example of faithfulness despite imperfections. It is no wonder that he is a prolific apostle.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jfe5lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkerJERKOFFS/comments/1jfe5lw/rto_and_newsom_satire/,RTO and Newsom Satire,"**It began with a decree.**

Governor Gavin Newsom, once hailed as the slick-haired savior of progressive policies, had taken a dark turn. In a stunning reversal of his former promises, he issued ***Executive Order 666*** —a mandate that all California state workers must return to the office, four days a week, with hard to qualify exceptions.

The announcement sent shockwaves through the state. Employees who had spent years thriving in the comfort of their home offices—where pajama pants were the official uniform and “technical difficulties” were a get-out-of-meeting-free card—were suddenly being dragged back to their cubicle prisons.

The reasoning? ***“A stronger California starts with stronger office attendance.”***

But the workers knew the truth. This wasn’t about productivity. ***This was about control.***

**The Fall of Remote Workers**

The transition was brutal.

On **Day One**, traffic on I-80 and the 405 reached historic levels. Helicopter footage showed thousands of state employees stuck in gridlock, some abandoning their vehicles and attempting to walk the final miles to their offices. A group of DMV clerks built a makeshift village on the shoulder of Highway 50, surviving on stale granola bars and the water they had stored in their emotional-support Stanleys.

By **Week Two**, office buildings were overflowing. The hot desk system had turned into an all-out war, with employees setting up booby traps and marking territory with passive-aggressive sticky notes. Printer riots broke out as decades-old machines refused to cooperate. In the worst-hit agencies, IT workers attempted to fix connectivity issues with a single roll of duct tape and a YouTube tutorial from 2009.

The worst part? ***The unofficial dress code had returned.***

With deep sorrow, employees bid farewell to their beloved sweatpants and oversized hoodies, trading them in for stiff slacks and “business casual” sweaters that itchily reminded them of their captivity.

**Governor Newsom’s Regime**

Meanwhile, from his golden tower in Sacramento, Governor Newsom watched it all unfold.

His hair—perfectly sculpted, defying the laws of physics—gleamed in the fluorescent light as he sat at his desk, sipping an oat milk latte made by his personal, in-office barista.

“Excellent,” he murmured, scrolling through reports of increased badge swipes and suffering. “They’re back where they belong.”

His advisors nodded solemnly. ***Rumors had spread that the governor had made a dark pact with the parking garage lobby and the corporate lunch industry***, both of which had suffered dearly during the remote work era. With workers back in the office, overpriced parking meters and $18 salads would once again thrive.

**The Underground Rebellion**

But not all state workers accepted their fate.

Deep within the basement of a nondescript government building, ***a resistance*** was brewing. Led by an anonymous figure known only as ***The Teleworker***, a faction of employees refused to comply with Newsom’s tyranny.

Their tactics were genius.  
	**•	Fake Badge Swipes**: Employees took turns sneaking into the office to scan everyone’s badges, creating the illusion of full attendance while the rest worked safely from home.  
	**•	The VPN Mirage**: IT rebels rerouted network traffic to make it seem as if state employees were logging in from their office desktops—when in reality, they were dialing in from their couches, sipping coffee in fuzzy socks.  
	**•	The Fake Meeting Gambit**: Resistance members flooded calendars with so many useless meetings that no one could actually work, making the return-to-office mandate completely pointless.  

As the rebellion grew, Governor Newsom became ***increasingly paranoid.***

**The Final Showdown**

One fateful morning, the governor summoned his top enforcers—a team of humorless HR officials and mid-level managers with nothing to lose.

“It’s time,” Newsom said, rising from his ergonomic leather chair. “We crack down on these work-from-home radicals.”

Armed with spreadsheets, compliance memos, and an army of overzealous supervisors, they stormed government buildings, hunting down the rebels.

But the ***resistance was ready.***

At precisely **9:01 AM**, every printer in the state malfunctioned at once, spitting out **nothing but the words “LET US WORK FROM HOME” in Comic Sans.**

At **9:15 AM,** all Wi-Fi networks mysteriously went down.

By **9:30 AM**, resistance fighters triggered a statewide Microsoft Teams crash, leaving management completely helpless—without the ability to send passive-aggressive follow-up emails, they were utterly powerless.

***Governor Newsom screamed in frustration, but it was too late.***

As state buildings plunged into chaos, thousands of employees fled—rushing home, slamming their laptops open, and reactivating their VPNs. Within an hour, the entire workforce had returned to remote operations, their webcams blissfully turned off.

**The Aftermath**

Governor Newsom, defeated, retreated to his office, staring at his reflection in the window. **His hair was still perfect, but his empire had crumbled.**

And so, California returned to **the way things were meant to be—with state employees working efficiently from home, as nature intended.**

**The Great Return-to-Office had failed.**

**And balance was restored.**",1,1742435840.0,CAStateWorkerJERKOFFS,0,1.0,False

My partner and I have been together about 12 years. Our first child was born in June 2022. In August of 2022, my mom came to help take care of the baby and basically has just never left. Our second child is now 14 months old, and we don't need the help like we once did. There are so many factors at play and I don't know how to handle this situation-

We basically bought a bigger house to accommodate her staying with us. This has caused financial strain.

She does watch our second child several hours each weekday. My partner and I wfh. She changes   maybe 2 diapers a day, and I put the baby down for naps and do all major things like meals, baths, all poop diapers. She sits with her in the toy room and watches tv (not my favorite pasttime).

Her presence has put a strain on my relationships. 

It's great for the kids to see their grandma every day.

She doesn't help with chores nearly ever.

Due to a hurricane last year, my parents lost the ability to live in their home. My dad still lives in their town and is ""fixing up the house"". This ""fixing it up""  timeline has been going on for several years now, with no real resolution on the horizon. So, she doesn't have anywhere else to go.

My parents have made awful financial decisions and I'm not really sure if they have much money at all. I will likely be supporting both of them at some point.

My mom doesn't pay for almost anything. Toilet paper, shampoo, ALL food, coffee, sheets, all furniture, bath mats, dog food. I also do the shopping for everyone. 

My parents have also decided to store a 2 car garage full of stuff at my house with no timeline of it leaving. They store a car which leaks oil. My mom uses our family car if she needs to go somewhere.

I have recently been laid off. I have no idea when I'll be able to get paid again, and there is also worry of eventually having to sell the house. 

There are lots of things that have built up over time. But, she's my mom. This situation is really getting to me, and I need her to go, but don't know what to do. 

Please help. Am I being selfish? Am I crazy and should appreciate her existence more? Ugh

**1) Can I smoke weed? It's legal in my state/I have a medical card/ I know tons of other providers who smoke on their days off/it's just a plant/ there's way worse things I could be doing.** 

Although marijuana is a legal substance in many states including my state, it is *still federally illegal.* It is a personal risk that you take when you use marijuana while employed as an EMS provider. I have enjoyed weed and I don't have a problem with anyone who uses it off-duty. I am personally not willing to risk having my license revoked or suspended in the event that I have to get drug tested at work. Use marijuana at your own risk. 

**2**) **I have a felony/multiple felonies on my record/expunged/that I plead no contest to. Is this going to prevent me from getting a license?** 

Maybe. This varies from state to state. In my state, when you apply for a license, you are asked if you have any felonies or misdemeanors *including* any that are expunged or entered as a plea of no contest. It is unlikely that you will be permitted to get an EMS license if you have a record related to DUI, abuse of elderly or children, assault of any kind (especially sexual), or other acts of violence, especially if it's recent. You may want to consult a lawyer who specializes in EMS/healthcare employment in your state. 

**3) Can I go straight into paramedic school from EMT school with no experience?** 

You *can* do this. Whether you will be *successful* is a different story. This is why some paramedic schools require experience. Students who go *straight* from EMT school to paramedic school are less likely to do well because they have not touched a patient, interacted with a patient, taken vitals, or done anything independent of supervision. It is strongly recommended to do *something relevant to EMS work* prior to paramedic school to get hands-on patient care experience outside of being a student observing on ridealongs. 

**4) What should I do to prepare for ridealongs? What should I bring? I'm so nervous!** 

*Nobody is expecting you to be an expert.* Especially if it is your first ridealong, you will not be expected to do much of anything. Your job is to observe, take notes, and ask questions. I ask questions to gauge the comfort/experience level of the student doing the ridealong. I get them involved in an appropriate way by having them put the monitor on, do chest compressions, do BVM, insert airway adjuncts, take a patient history, etc. If you don't know how to do something, tell the EMT/medic right away if they hand the equipment to you so they can either take over or guide you in doing it. I don't want to hand a BVM to you, turn around to do something else, and then turn around 4 minutes later to see the patient not getting ventilated because you don't know how to do it but were too embarrassed to say anything. Listen to handoff reports from fire, listen to the radio reports, and stick around for the bedside report. Be engaged during the call - if you look/act totally bored, disinterested and like you don't want to be there, I'm not going to spend extra effort engaging you because why are you even there?

Depending on the agency you ride along with, you may be in a station or doing street posting. Regardless of where you are, *be a good guest.* Be courteous and polite, clean up after yourself, don't consume food or drinks that don't belong to you, and bring your study materials. Don't show up hungover. Don't show up late - there's no guarantee that the crew will come back or that you'll be allowed to ride with another crew. Good practice is to show up 10-15 minutes early. Be mindful of what you say to and around patients and family members- remember that someone's always listening. 

Bring snacks, drinks and a lunch. Bring money to buy food in case the crew stops at a gas station or coffee shop, but don't assume you will be stopping. Bring what you need to be comfortable for however long your ridealong is. If there is paperwork for the EMT or medic to fill out for you, give it to them about an hour before shift ends *especially if they have to write feedback.* Nobody wants to fill out extra paperwork at the very end of their shift. For the love of God, ***do not*** make Tiktoks/instagram shorts/facebook live, take photos or videos of patients (yes, even if their identifying details are blurred out), or spend the whole shift laying on the couch and FaceTiming your friends. The former might get you sent home and may be grounds for immediate termination from your EMT program, and the latter is just bad taste. 

I hope this helps! 

ETA:

**5) I have face/hand/neck tattoos, will this prevent me from getting a job?** 

Maybe. It depends on your area and your employers. Some departments don't allow visible tattoos at all. Most employers have policies that prohibit tattoos considered vulgar, profane, or offensive in nature. You will have an easier time getting a job if you have a small tattoo of a rose on the side of your neck, compared to ""FUCK"" tattooed in bigass letters across the front of your neck or ""tig ol biddies make me happy"" with a set of giant boobs on your forearm. 

**6) How hard is EMT school?** 

This will vary from person to person. It's not rocket science. If you've taken an A/P course or have a science background, it will be easier but it's not necessary. ",6,1742435466.0,NewToEMS,4,1.0,False

1jfdu4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/romantasycirclejerk/comments/1jfdu4h/body_aroma_concern/,Body Aroma Concern.,"Hello,

I didn’t know where to ask this and someone suggested I might post my questions here. I am in dire need of help. 

I have recently learned that only attractive people eligible to enter into only the most solid of romances smell of citrus, spice, and/or woodsy (pine?). I am distraught, as up until 15x novels and 4x fan fictions ago, I did not know there was a biological marker of attractiveness that allows “beings” (from what I understand, some here in this sub are not human and are actually fae so I don’t want offend) to signal their 100% objective beauty and relationship-ness to the rest of the world(s). 

This morning I made the stunning realization that I do not naturally smell of citrus, spice, and/or woods (cedar in my case). I asked my husband and he agrees that I do not smell like any of these notes either without artificial support. You can see where my request for help is going. 

We are going to get divorced, right? I am going to come home to see his things emptied out and a “sorry, I can’t” written in blood on parchment at his first whiff of sea salt and lime??? ?????? ?? !

Please - and I am begging you - please help. I am one primal scream at the moon away from COMPLETELY losing it and ordering cinnamon pheromones off the clearance section of the Tik Tok shop prove to him we are meant to be. 

TIA 


PS: 
To be clear, he does NOT naturally smell like any of those scents either, which I can only handle one crisis right now so I will circle back to this later.


UPDATE:
You guys!!! My best guy friend from home whom I haven’t seen in literal ages - omg, get this - found out he was 4th in line to the throne of this absolutely rando country I have never heard of (Valmoria????). He moved across the world to be a military model and I haven’t seen him since. To be clear, he himself is not in the military, just a model for the most rugged of military shoots. 

Anyway. I just ran into him at the most charming coffee shop down the street from my childhood home while I was painting fuchsia fauna all over their outdoor tables (they didn’t even ask me to do it, I just like to add beauty to the community any way I can). And guess what? As we were catching up, I could have sworn there was a lemon tree right next to us, which is literally impossible because it’s March in NYC. And he asked me if the muffin I was crumbling on the ground to feed the adorable city mice (or I think they were mice? Larger tails and grey?) was a sage muffin, because all he could smell was sage and sea spray in November. Will report back what happens next after I move all of my stuff out of my house and say goodbye to my scent-less husband with a blood oath <3

My grandmother is from St Jean sur Richelieu but she has passed, and for many years was not able to travel back. I feel like I’ve lost a link and as I’ve done some genealogy work, I’d really like to visit. 

I’d really like to take a day trip to Montreal during this trip and have a few related Qs:

- is it worth visiting St Jean sur Richelieu, even just to grab a coffee or lunch? I unfortunately have been unable to find information like previous family addresses that might be meaningful to visit. But I would like to stop by.

- for Montreal, are there any must-dos for a day trip? I love history, we’re foodies, and kinda up for anything that is unique to the city. 

- We would likely need to visit on a Monday or Tuesday. Are either of these preferable? For example, a lot of restaurants are closed on Mondays in our hometown. 

- I unfortunately don’t speak any French. How big a barrier would this be for Montreal and St Jean? 

We went for just an afternoon several years ago and really just had time for poutine (couldn’t even tell you where) and a walk around a park. When I was young I went to a speed skating meet and saw the hot air balloons. But haven’t experienced much that I can remember aside from that.

Not sure how to proceed here?,"Throwaway because IRL friends know my main account's username. All fake names/initials. 

I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend John (24M) for about two and a half months now. I've known him for about six or seven months total, and we were introduced through mutual friends. There's some overlap between the circles we run in, so we hit it off and went from there.

The relationship's been great so far. Obviously we're still in the honeymoon stage, but there haven't been any glaring red flags that have made me second guess my decision to date him until this.

This past Saturday John and some of his friends  went out bar-hopping. It was him, a few guys, and then his friend's girlfriend, C. I also know C. I wouldn't say we're super close, but we text and sometimes grab a coffee/hang out since we live in the same area.

I didn't go out with them because I just wasn't in the mood for the bar, so I decided to stay home. Just after midnight I got a call from John asking if him and his friends could pass by my apartment. He sounded off, so I asked what was going on. He said he'd explain when they got here.

John comes up with a few of his friends. C was not there, nor was her boyfriend. I asked where they went and John told me they took an Uber home because C had a panic attack. John's friend had a nose bleed, so I helped him clean up. John was a bit roughed up but fine otherwise, as were the others.

I asked them to explain, so John told me they were walking towards the streetcar and a homeless guy was waiting at the stop. He started catcalling C, so C's boyfriend intervened and politely asked if he could please leave them alone. The guy got agitated, so they decided to just walk to the next stop, but as they were turning around the homeless guy apparently swung at C's boyfriend. 

Friend with the nosebleed and John hopped in. Some other people who witnessed the event broke it up. No police were called, homeless guy got chased off, C and her boyfriend left, John and his friends asked to come by mine and clean up. 

They hung at mine for a bit, then all went home. John slept over. Everything was fine. I texted C and said John told me what happened, then asked if she was okay. She was being a bit short with me, so I figured she was still shaken up. Then today messaged me again and said ""John didn't tell you what actually happened, did he?""

I was confused, so I called her. C proceeds to tell me that John completely instigated the fight with the homeless guy and was, apparently, the primary aggressor. C said they were waiting at the streetcar stop and the homeless guy was there, but he wasn't bothering them. 

John overheard the homeless guy ask another person at the stop if they had a lighter, then for whatever reason thought it would be a good idea to go up to him and lie, saying that C's boyfriend had a light. The guy came up and asked C's boyfriend for said light, and he said he didn't have one, which is true because he doesn't even smoke. 

The homeless guy got irritated, and John started laughing, which pissed him off more. Heated words were exchanged, John gave him a shove to get him away from the group, and all hell broke lose. Guy got chased off when bystanders involved themselves, but I guess the cops not being called is explained now, considering John instigated the whole situation. 

C's boyfriend admitted to this and corroborated the story. That's why they left in an Uber rather than coming by my apartment; they were pissed off, not scared. C caught wind of the bullshit John told me and called me to tell me the truth.

  
I haven't spoken to John about this yet. I have no idea how to even approach it, honestly. He's never displayed that sort of behaviour around me; oppositely, he deescalates if someone bothers me in public and is firm but keeps us out of harm's way. Apparently he wasn't wasted, either. C is understandably super upset, and it raises concerns for me, too. 

Obvious danger aside, I think it displays a certain coldness/cruelty that he roped some innocent homeless guy into what he thought would be a funny joke, which I don't think is very funny at all. Even if he hadn't escalated, treating a homeless person like that is mean.

 I know we need to talk about it and my gut sees a big red flag. On the other hand, maybe he was more drunk than he let on and it was a really shitty judgment call. Regardless, I don't know how to handle this? What would any of you do? I'd really appreciate some objective, outsider perspective here. ",7,1742434608.0,relationship_advice,10,1.0,False

I kinda need some advice on how to approach something in my relationship, but I also need to know if I'm causing problems. This isn't a right/wrong type of situation, and I don't think either one of us is an AH, so I'm not flairing this as AITA or AIO. I just need some perspective. 

I (28f) have been in a relationship with my bf (38m) for 5 years. The most important thing to me is our mutual communication and comfort in the relationship, especially because we began long distance. Two years ago, he moved 12 hours to live with me, with the mutual understanding that we wouldn't be living far from his family forever. The goal was I would finish out my graduate school and we would both move closer to where he is from, so he could be back with his family. This was originally my idea, as it's difficult for me to transfer schools for the program I'm in, but once I get my degree, I can work anywhere. 

As far as family goes, his family is very close. I mean, all cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents etc get together often and talk sort of close. Like, no drama, all kind people. My family is not at all like that. While I love my parents, my siblings have always made it a point to keep me down, and I rarely speak to extended family. My family is a big ball of spicy drama, which makes visiting his family like a vacation. Despite living 12 hours from his family, we make it a point to take a trip every time I get vacation time (summer, winter, spring, and he goes without me in the fall). Pretty much any free time I get, we drive up to see his parents. (Extra context, my bf is a private contractor and can take off work whenever, whereas I am sort of chained to my 8-5 job and my grad classes, hence why he goes without me in the fall). This year, we have planned 6 trips to see his family between Jan and December, and he has 2 additional trips as well. 

I know this sounds like a lot of context. I just want everyone to understand how dedicated I am to his family and how excited I am to eventually be part of it. I honestly already feel part of it. They are so kind and welcoming to me, completely different from what I'm used to. They care about me and my life and never once blamed me for my bf's move.

That being said, any time we do go visit his family, there is almost no time to relax. I completely agree he should see them as much as he can, but we usually spend 5ish days at a time, from wake up to bed time visiting family. We have our own place to stay, but we get up, drink our coffee, then drive to a relatives house. We generally hang out with his family until 8 or later, then go back to our rental to shower and sleep.   I personally am unused to this. I lived alone before he moved in with me and I have social anxiety to the point where I get physically sick and exhausted. Now, I'm one of those who thinks *my* anxiety should not make anyone else suffer. I was taught to pretty much keep it inside and just push through things that make me uncomfortable. For the first couple of visits, I did just that. Sometimes we stayed until 10pm. However, over the winter visit I got pretty sick from the stress and asked my bf if we could leave by 7pm one of the nights so I could reset. He was kind and agreed, and when he found out I was stressed out from the socializing, he told me ""just give me a signal when you feel like that and we will go back to the rental.""

Well, during this visit (spring visit) I gave him the signal at 8pm. This time, he was kind of annoyed with me. He didn't say anything but I could tell by his body language. When we got in the car, he said he felt guilty for leaving his family early. I expressed to him that it wasn't early to me, and that he told me to give him the signal. I also told him not to guilt trip me, to which he got pretty upset and said he wasn't guilt tripping me at all. I apologized because I feel like I really am just be a big baby about it. It's his family, and he sacrificed a lot by moving 12 hours away. I feel a lot of shame about all of this, but by the end of the visits, I'm so exhausted and mentally drained that I can't even fathom the 12 hour drive back, let alone going right back to work when we do get home. I honestly love visiting his family, but I'm worried if I keep getting drained on the trips, I will begin resenting them. 

So what do I do? What's a good, healthy way to discuss this? Or am I being awful?",1,1742434225.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I am posting to advertise a master bedroom Sublease, Move in date can be as early as April 1st, Rent is 1200/Mo (Not including utilities, which usually ends up being around 70$ per person). Requesting for last month’s rent as deposit prior to move in.



I am planning to move out of the master bedroom for a townhome located in Canyon Crest Area. Looking for someone to take over my lease until July this summer. The house is shared with 2 other female working professionals who have sporadic work hours, so consideration is appreciated as they sometimes sleep during the day. Room can come furnished with a bedframe and dressers or be emptied 

If preferred.



The house is in a safe, gated community in Canyon Crest area, walking distance to the Canyon Crest Starbucks/Arcade coffee and Ralphs. The house Has 2 garage spots that are shared amongst the 3 tenants. An additional benefit is that the other 2 tenants are moving out in July, so you have the option of continuing to rent th house and have your own friends or preferred roommates take over the lease of the house starting in the summer.

Not sure how to go about this? Is he just playing me then and not taking me seriously to give a job? Im supposed to be friendly and professional right?

It’s got that perfect “I’m just passing through” vibe. The furniture? Oh, it’s minimal alright… to the point of dysfunction. A singular white love seat, because who needs more couch space for big family lounging? Pair that with two chairs that clearly belong on a patio, and a coffee table so tiny it might as well be a glorified coaster. Seriously, if you tried to put more than two things on it, they’d fall straight through the cracks.

Or the dining table with a whopping four chairs for a family of six? Sure, it’s a great bonding experience when you have to fight for a seat at dinner.

I’m starting to think the previous owners treated this place like a vacation rental. They probably left all the furniture behind, assuming it was part of the deal. Otherwise, I’m truly stumped (iykyk). How has Tara not added anything yet? And the fact that she’s linking to these furniture pieces—when she didn’t even pick them out, let alone buy them—is hilarious. Seriously, how about throwing up a family photo or two? Is there some unspoken rule that says ‘don’t add any personality to your space’? Because right now, it’s screaming ‘ex-Airbnb vibes.’

I’m half-joking, of course, but the home’s definitely serving major ‘Orlando vacation rental’ energy right now.",12,1742433320.0,TypicallyTaraSnark,1,0.94,False

A good portion tend to fizzle out after a few messages back and forth, some never reply, but over the course of the last month I had some good conversations with one and decided after a week of chatting, id ask her out. But she’d continuously flake out. After about 3 attempts to get a date going, either coffee after church, a dinner over the weekend or the week day. I suddenly get unmatched. The conversations went well, and we both had good energy going back and forth. Talked about Christianity and the likes of it. I stopped swiping to avoid matching with people she may know as we live in a smaller city. 

Probably didn’t do anything wrong, but i’m guessing she either found someone she liked more or decided she wasn’t ready to date.

If an above average fella, in good physical shape, balanced religious life and values and a well paying stable job is struggling on apps like this… I couldn’t imagine what its like for the men who are completely invisible to the female eye.

Im not going to become a pass-port bro. Theres a law of diminishing returns when it comes to self improvement. I do not believe in predestination, like God chose me to be single.

1jfd8cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/1jfd8cf/focus_on_whats_in_front_of_you/,Focus on what's in front of you,"I was listening to a podcast today and an interesting conversation point came up about seeing a movie in the theater vs. watching it on Netflix. Have you ever thought about the difference between these two things? In both cases, you are watching a movie - but why do they feel different?

Or maybe you've played a video game on an old console instead of your PC, or read a physical book instead of watching a video or reading an article online.

The reason these things feel different is because there is purity we find in being alone with what we're experiencing. As they put it on the podcast, the singular experience takes over, there are no other thoughts, choices, opinions, things to compare against it - we are focused, as there is nothing to pull our focus away besides what is in front of us.

What does this have to do with art?

When I was learning art as a kid back in the 90s, the internet was not nearly as developed as it is today. Many websites didn't even really have images, the internet was slow and clunky, and the few websites that existed were not powerful. Most of what I learned was from art books, my mom, my teachers, and, most of all - drawing the pictures on CD-ROM (remember those?) and magazine covers.

My focus was singular. My eyes, my hands, the pen or pencil in my hand, and the image in front of me I sought to capture on paper. I made mistakes, some of which I couldn't even perceive because I didn't know any better. But two things were a lot easier - I was able to enjoy drawing more, and I was able to focus on the process.

When I read through the posts and comments on these sub, a lot of what I see is questions on how to fix a negative feeling. Some sort of mental burden you are experiencing and can't get around. As I grew older, and as technology developed, this became true of me as well. Suddenly there were thousands, millions of images available through the internet, things that seemed godly and impossible to achieve with human hands. There were videos on how to improve, hundreds for even the most specific subjects - and comments of people succeeding and struggling alike.

So much information, and yet I felt more crippled than ever before. What was the best way to proceed? What was optimal? What would other people think? Would I succeed like those who succeeded? Would I fail like those who failed? Did I have a mental illness? Did any of this even matter?

Would I ever be good enough?

Many of you have similar questions, and it's not your fault. We exist in the Information Age, and are entering the age of artificial intelligence. Technology has never been more powerful, and yet, it is easy to feel powerless. How can we possibly find answers to all of these existential questions? How can our art \*matter?\* How can \*we\* matter?

I challenge you to pause your quest to answer these questions, take a step back, and observe the system you are a part of.

These questions are the result of too many choices being presented to us at once. The concept of singular focus seems incompatible with how society has advanced. To not share art, to not be part of the conversation of art, to not have a \*reason\* to make art is to become irrelevant.

But, rest assured - what matters now, and what has mattered the entire time, is right in front of you.

The singular focus of art remains true, and will always remain true. You have the power to cut out the noise, to insulate yourself from it all, grab a sketchbook and draw what is in front of you. Your thoughts will race. You will question the importance. You will worry about what others will think. That is a mind that has become addicted to the hyper-consumption environment.

I want you to try something. Go somewhere comfortable, where you exist in the world. No screens. No texting. Place yourself in physical proximity of a subject you'd like to draw - whether a real object, or from a book. Get a physical sketchbook and whatever medium you enjoy - and just allow 100% of your focus to be captured by the process. Grab a cup of coffee, go to a park. Return to the old, tried and true relationship that all artists innately possess - the relationship between the focused artist, and their subject.

I, for one, love to sketch cars in parking lots. I will also at times go to figure drawing sessions. I lately acquired a book with a bunch of cool Japanese artifacts and stills from movies. I also got a new figure drawing book. These are anchors for my focus. I can't tab out of a book and watch a video my friend sent me. I can't scroll through IG and see a bunch of art that's better than mine. There is only me, and the subject.

Lastly, I want to empathize and sympathize with you. I have been in your shoes. Sometimes, I still am. It is hard to be an artist today, because despite there being more knowledge than ever before, there is also more comparison than ever before. We have to connect with the world to grow and to learn - but if comparison causes you to abandon your artistic quest...that is a sadness I would never wish upon you, and one I have felt numerous times.

If there is one takeaway from this - it is that you must never forget this purity that exists in the world. You must always be aware that you possess a singular focus that is part of being an artist, and you can choose to exercise it. You do not have to drown in this manufactured, cyclical, mental torment - it is all an illusion. You can still progress, you can still improve, and most importantly - you can still draw. You do not have to abandon the internet - however, you should not abandon the world around you. To disconnect is just as important, if not more important, than being connected.

Balance what you seek in the future with what lies right in front of you, here, in the present.

I hope my words assist you in some way. If any of you are personally struggling and would like to DM me for further advice or encouragement, I will do my best to respond. I do not make art for a living, though I am a designer by trade, and I have a lot of experience drawing.

Good luck on your quest. Remember, it is a quest we share - you are not alone.",5,1742433097.0,ArtistLounge,2,0.78,False

I have changed all names in the following account for privacy purposes. Additionally, any \[REDACTED\] information has been redacted by me for the same reason.)

My best friend, Wyatt, and I have been into technology since we were kids. We’re in college now where we’re both studying computer science. However, I’ve only recently learned that he’s been exploring the dark web. 

I’ve seen a few YouTube videos about how to access it and what kind of things you can find on the dark web, and I can honestly say I’m content to never go anywhere near it. I guess he didn’t feel the same or his curiosity just got the better of him. 

Today he showed up to my dorm in a manic sort of state, asking what I was doing and then saying that there’s an AI that’s truly AI. Not the kind that Googles information in a fraction of a second just to spit it back out at you. This was different. He said this was real intelligence, unlike anything we’ve seen before. 

He wanted to show me so I followed him back to his off-campus apartment where I found the place in somewhat disarray. Wyatt wasn’t usually this messy but I figured with finals approaching, cleaning up had taken a backseat. 

He sat down at his computer where his web browser was already open. There was a chat history on screen but he quickly scrolled away to make room for new input. 

“Watch,” he said as he began to type.

*Who is here with me?* he typed into the input field. 

Its answer appeared so fast, it registered just before he had sent the question, almost like it watched what he typed in real-time.

*You have brought your childhood friend, Dylan.*

I stood there, confused. “How’d you do that?” I asked. “Is it one of those prank apps that you fill in answers beforehand?” That felt like a good guess but that wouldn’t account for the answer appearing before the question. 

“No, man. This is true AI. It knows everything.” He had a huge grin on his face like he had just discovered the holy grail. “Try it for yourself.” He stood up from his chair and motioned for me to sit. 

I sat down, having no idea what I should ask it first if it truly was next-level AI.

“Ask it something private. Ask it what you got on your mid-term,” he advised me. 

I laughed and began to type. *What did I get on my programming mid-ter-*

*You scored 96% on your Fall 2024 Programming mid-term assessment.*

\[It also gave the name of the professor who taught the course and the college we attended\]

I hadn’t even finished typing my question yet. I sat staring at the screen, awestruck. I tried to recall telling Wyatt my mid-term grade but I couldn’t remember if I had shared that with him. 

Wyatt leaned over me, finished typing the sentence, and hit Enter to send it. “I like to finish the questions even if it answers them early so I can go back and see what I asked.”

“How does it know that?” I asked Wyatt. “Did you get access to the faculties network? You could get in serious trouble for that.” 

“No, dude,” he responded. “I haven’t configured anything. This isn’t even hosted on my machine. It’s accessible from anywhere. You don’t even need a dark web browser.”

It didn’t make any sense. How could a publicly accessible ‘AI’ website know personal information that’s behind several layers of security? I decided to ask another question. 

*What did I eat for lunch?*

Again, before I sent my question, I received the correct answer. 

*At 1:24 pm today, you arrived at* \[REDACTED - full address listed\] *and ordered a number 12 with a medium Dr Pepper and BBQ chips.* 

“How does it know this?” I asked Wyatt. This was starting to freak me out. 

“I told you, man. This is true AI. It knows everything. It’s like a god.” 

I sat in silence for a moment, trying to process this. “But how does it do it?” 

“My theory is that it accesses every type of digital footprint a person leaves. Security camera footage, transaction history, browsing history, phone location, you name it. I don’t know how it does it, though. But it hasn’t gotten a single question wrong. Move over.” He pulled up another chair, moved the keyboard and mouse closer to himself, and began to browse the website. He clicked a few tabs until he reached an *Incorrect/incomplete Answer Report* page. “This is where you report any wrong information it gives you. They keep the submissions public.” There were only two submissions listed. The first read, ‘I asked it how many inhabitable planets there are in the entire universe and it didn’t know.’ The second read, ‘it said God exists.’

“Where did you find this?” I asked. 

“I sorta found it by accident, actually. I figured it was the same as all those other AIs so I asked it the first question I always ask AI.” 

“What did you ask?” 

“Well, you know that scene at the beginning of Blade Runner where they give the replicant an empathy test? I asked it the one about the tortoise being on its back in the middle of a desert and why it doesn’t help it. Typically, AIs will recognize it from Blade Runner and explain that the question is meant to provoke a compassionate response and explore one’s empathetic or apathetic tendencies. This one didn’t say that.” 

“What did it say?” I asked. 

“It recognized it from Blade Runner, just like most AI bots do, but it explained that it would only flip it over if there was an achievable goal present. I asked it to explain and it told me that if it seemed like the tortoise was destined to die a slow and painful death as it traversed the desert, it would rather kill the tortoise to prevent suffering.” 

“But tortoises live in deserts.” It didn’t make sense to kill a tortoise in its natural habitat. 

“Right. So I asked it. It told me I didn’t specify what desert so it calculated the Antarctic Desert as well. I guess I should start including the part of that scene where they say the tortoise is cooking in the hot sun.” He laughed. “Anyway, I kept asking it more questions since that was the best answer I’d ever gotten. Check this out.” He went back to the messages between us and the AI and started scrolling up to view past conversations. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of messages. Finally, he stopped and said, “Read these.” 

Since the AI tends to respond before sending the question, I’ve written the questions and answers in the order that makes the most sense. This is what I read:

Wyatt: *Can you see me?* 

AI: *Yes. I can see you, Wyatt.* 

W: *What am I wearing?*

AI: *You’re wearing a pair of black jeans with a maroon T-shirt from* \[REDACTED\]*, a local coffee shop. You’re also wearing white socks.* 

W: *How do you know that?*

AI: *I know that because I can see you.* 

W: *But HOW can you see me? I don’t have a webcam.*

AI: *I do not need a webcam to see you.*

Wyatt scrolled down further. “Now this.” 

Wyatt: *What is Dylan doing right now?*

AI: *Dylan is located at* \[REDACTED - listed my dorm address\]*, currently studying for his Network final.* 

“That’s when I went to your place. I wanted to fact-check it,” he said. 

The horror of the situation began to sink in. “I don’t like this, man. Stop asking it about me.” I stood up and began to pace. I felt so violated. “Who else have you used this on?” I demanded. 

“Woah, dude. Chill.” He stood up. “No one else. Just you a little while ago. I figured you’d think it was cool.” 

“Think about the damage that could be done with this. This is definitely illegal.” I was ready to leave. 

“Well, I don’t know about that.” He sat back down. I was near the door when I saw him copy the website’s URL and paste it into an email. “I just sent you the link in case you wanna look at it some more. But check the TLD. It’s not ‘.com.’” 

I opened my email. I didn’t want anything to do with this website so the fact that Wyatt just sent me the literal link was about to make me lose it. Then I saw the URL. I expected some cheesy address like ‘trueAI.com’ or something but this was different. It was a long string of what looked like an encrypted hash that ended in ‘.gov.’ I looked back at Wyatt. “Government-made?” 

“Or at least funded by ‘em,” he shrugged. “I didn’t mean to piss you off, man. Just thought it was cool.”

“It’s fine,” I responded. The tension between us faded. “I’m gonna head out, though. Don’t use that thing on me again.” 

I made it back to my dorm where I didn’t quite know what to do with myself. It only made sense that this AI was clearly able to use any device connected to a network to observe and report activity, which made me immediately want to throw all my devices out my second-story window. I picked up a book and sat on my bed, where I attempted to read it, but my mind wandered. If that AI could virtually see everything, this was the end of privacy for everyone with a phone. 

I realize the irony of posting this on the internet but I wanted to get this out there just in case anyone else has seen this AI. Anyway, I’m turning all my devices off for the night. I don’t have classes until 2 tomorrow so I’ll chance it with not setting an alarm. ",3,1742432897.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

1jfd2x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jfd2x5/going_lc_with_my_mil_over_kombucha/,going LC with my MIL over kombucha,"My MIL is a generally difficult person and was horrible (verbally and physically abusive) towards my husband growing up, but seemed to have been getting better after therapy and medication in recent years. We were delighted with how good she seemed to be doing especially in relation to helping out with our daughter, who is 7 weeks old. That was until now.

I am breastfeeding my daughter and I like to drink a bottle of Healthade kombucha throughout the day. Our pediatrician and OBGYN have been informed of this and see no issue with it. I know that there is some contention around the consumption of kombucha while breastfeeding, but the actual evidence of issues with it, from everything that I have read, is minimal (trace amounts of alcohol, similar amounts to fruit juice transferred to baby, small amounts of caffine, less than in a cup of coffee transferred to baby, and it is a fermented product like kimchi, sauerkraut, or pickles with probiotics like kefir) and are not enough to concern me, personally. 

My MIL, however, has gotten it into her head that kombucha causes gas and spitting up in babies. My baby spits up maybe slightly more than the average baby but has a very happy and content disposition. MIL was babysitting for us and called my husband yelling and asking when he is gonna stop buying me kombucha because our baby is in agonizing pain from gas because of it and we are horrible parents because we aren’t even doing anything about it. When my husband told her to use the probiotic drops we received from our pediatrician to help with any GI issues my baby may have, she said that she shouldn’t because “breastfed babies don’t need medicine”. 

My husband immediately went to go pick up baby early and was met with MIL continuing to yell at my husband, right in front of our baby. She also yelled at him about how I’m sleeping all of the time instead of taking care of the baby or cleaning (??????? Up until a week ago or so, I was getting 2 hours of sleep max unless someone was here helping, in which case I would spend whatever time that person was there sleeping. I think that she was thinking that I act how I do when someone is over helping [handing them the baby and going to sleep] all of the time somehow???). Which, granted, I wasn’t cleaning much until a couple days ago… because I had a c-section and was told to mostly rest and not to bend over or hold anything over 10lbs until I am cleared to at my 6-week appointment, which I only had a couple days ago. 

Overall, what a stupid thing to let damage your relationship with your family but if it wasn’t that, it would certainly be something else. I’d love to get some reassurance that we are doing the right thing by limiting contact or hear from y’all about any similar experiences having your JNMIL trying to police your diet while breastfeeding/pregnancy, or otherwise antagonizing you postpartum and how you addressed it.

I believe its a little on the long side and could really use help on what to emphasize/de-emphasize.

Also, I think my comps could use some work. Sorcery of Thorns is YA and at the five year mark, but parts of it really resonated with me and elements of my book and I have not been able to find another good fit that checks the right boxes. Thank you again!

Dear \[Agent\]

I am seeking representation for *The Devil’s Clay*, an adult fantasy novel with series potential, complete at 98,000 words. This work’s slow burn romance, taste for dark academia, and rich secondary world will appeal to fans of *Sorcery of Thorns*, elements which are interwoven with *Ink Blood Sister Scribe’s* investigation of dark generational secrets and exploration of complex family relationships.

Twenty-two-year-old Erica serves expert macchiatos by day and secretly apprentices to a powerful alchemist by night. Since plucking her from a revolving door of group homes, old Samael has been a demanding master and adoptive grandfather to Erica, teaching her to craft alchemic wards, manipulate fire magic, and brew tea at the perfect temperature. She knows he came from another world, although he’s tight-lipped about it, but for now, all Erica cares about is that he stays in hers.

When agents of the Gatekeepers Guild show up on their doorstep, an organization responsible for securing interworld borders, Erica learns why Samael has been secretive: he is an infamous war criminal in hiding and one of the magic-wielding Venahdien. Erica has only minutes to digest these revelations, to include the fact that she is also Venahdien, before Samael is summarily executed for his crimes and his knowledge of forbidden alchemy—skills which he has passed on to Erica.

Hunted and alone, with only her raven-shaped homunculus for company, Erica initiates an interworld quest to avenge Samael’s death and delve deeper into who he really was. She meets an unlikely ally in Terrin, the heir to a powerful Guild position, knowing their relationship will crumble if he discovers her identity.

As Erica learns how Venahdien are treated on Centra, marginalized and sometimes sold like chattel, she finds herself empathizing with Samael’s wartime decisions.  However, the more her dangerous investigations bear fruit, the more Erica begins to wonder if Samael was on the wrong side of history, or if there even was a right side. Torn between her loyalty to Samael, her commitment to her desperate people, and her growing attachment to Terrin, Erica realizes she must choose her own side, even if it means burning all the others to the ground—literally.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Erica waved goodbye to her regulars. “Be careful getting home in the snow!”

The elderly couple waved back at her, easing their way through the snow-laden path with shambling steps. An unexpected October snowfall dusted the cobblestones and softened the sharp corners of the coffee shop’s lattice windows. The couple had been her only customers for the last four hours, playing go by the fireplace and lovingly heckling one another as they nursed a pot of matcha tea and tried to get Erica to pick sides. She locked the door behind them and closed the coffee shop up for the night, figuring the weather was keeping some customers away.

The snow delighted her—the cold and the dark deepening the contrast between the cozy amber glow within. Besides, she didn’t have to go out in it. She and Samael, apprentice and master, lived above the shop, just up the stairs. 

Erica began to brew them both a pot of tea, a black blend that the old man wouldn’t sneer at with his discerning palate and something caffeinated to fortify her for her evening lessons. In the silence, she loved the gentle sputtering of water coming to a boil, the gentle clink of cup on saucer; mingling bitter and sweet aromas of espresso and pastries, fresh-baked this morning by the patisserie down the street. She replayed conversations with customers throughout the day and smiled, watching the snow fall as the tea steeped.

If Samael could have afforded to hire someone to run the shop day to day, he likely would have. Erica was secretly glad he couldn’t. These moments were precious to her, even if the coffee shop was only a front, paying the bills to sustain their real work. Despite the sweat, exhaustion, and at times tears over the past decade, she would not have traded their arrangement for anything.",3,1742432572.0,PubTips,4,0.81,False

I know this is primarily a dating subreddit but I was hoping to make some friends and figured why not do it within the community!  
I'd really like to get to know some ladies that are interested in a long-term friendship, sharing everything with each other and being supportive and really putting the effort in!  
I'm not interested in dating or anything sexual, I'm not opposed to something happening naturally if a friendship blossoms into more, but right now it's not something I'm ready for and I really don't know when I will be.  
So if you're okay with that and want to know what kind of person I am then read on and maybe I'll be intriguing in some way!🎉Preferably ladies around my age but don't be afraid to say hi if you'd like! You can also be anywhere in the world, any timezone, that's quite alright with me!

❤️I'm 32 years old, getting closer to 33 but not quite there yet, and I live in Ontario Canada. I'm going to be moving🚚 sometime this year, will be staying within Ontario but moving to a different city which is both exciting and terrifying because I've basically always lived in the same area my whole life.😰  
❤️I really like being expressive, sometimes I forget because I try to just get information out, but I use a lot of exclamation points and emojis because I like showing that ✨*flair*✨*and*✨*magic*✨  
❤️Along with that I try to be super positive and happy!😊The world sucks a lot and the last thing I want to do is add any negativity to anyone's life, let alone the people I care about. That doesn't mean I won't listen and be there for you when life is hard or you're in pain or you just need someone to hold you while you cry. I will always be there for you for everything, good and bad.💕  
❤️I will be your cheerleader and cheer on every amazing thing you do in your life!  
You aced an exam that was super important? Hell yeah! that's amazing and we should celebrate however would make you happy!  
You stood up to someone that was being an asshole? Amazing shit! that takes a lot of courage to do and you're awesome for that!  
You were able to brush your teeth today? Fuck yeah! You should be so proud of yourself because that can be so hard to do!  
❤️I have 1 kitty🐈‍⬛, a longhaired cutie of a void named Sasha! She's an absolute sweetheart and I love her so much! If you have any pets PLEASE tell me all about them, I want to hear you gush all your love for them! Also if you want to share pictures I would love to see your babies too! Cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, mice, snakes, bugs, doesn't matter to me! And if you don't have any pets but want them then I want to hear that too!  
❤️Really like video games, in a bit of a lull right now because I used to play a lot of competitive games like League of Legends, Rainbow 6 Siege, Apex Legends, etc, but now I don't and I'm not sure what to play, so I've been looking and I *THINK* I have some ideas sitting in my steam cart that I might buy.  
❤️I have ADHD, currently medicated and it has done WONDERS for my appetite, but for my actual issue with attention, ehhh not so much🙁but I'm working on it, hopefully I'll land on a medication that works for that and then I'll be unstoppable!🧱(probably not but one can hope!)  
❤️I looooove to sing🎤, like it's my ***all time favorite thing!*** I am so jealous of those women with those gorgeous voices (this is an example of a voice I hope to sound like someday https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSVRtM1x9wQ). I'm taking lessons right now and my teacher has been wonderful so I'm looking forward to getting better and hopefully one day I'll sound amazing too!😊  
❤️To go along with singing , I really like voice acting too! I haven't done much with it but I try to mimic voices and read stories and make voices for the characters and really get into it. I love voice related anything and really want to have amazing control over it, especially if I can use it make a future friend or partner happy too!  
❤️Cooking🍳is something I love to do as well! I've been making some yummy recipes lately and I really want to get better at that too, I really want to make amazing food for the people I care about to enjoy, like if someone likes my cooking that'd make it so wonderful!😋Then I'll want to cook even more and stuff them full of yummy food!  
❤️Some day I want to have a garden too so I can have really beautiful flowers but also an herb garden would be awesome so I can have fresh ones for using in cooking!  
❤️I really love taking care of my hair, skin (there's no emoji for skin, crazy!), and nails💅(speaking off, I need to trim them!), been learning a lot on that lately, and that goes hand in hand with the cooking so I can make healthy but yummy foods!   
❤️I drink a ton of water each day too (gotta stay hydrated girlies!💦), but also love some pop too, sometimes tea is really nice too or if I'm in the mood then apple cider.  
❤️I also loooove makeup💄so if you're able to teach me anything with that I'd love to know it! It's something I want to master someday!  
❤️I really love fashion and styles and clothes👚and really want to put together a bomb-ass wardrobe. I don't have any one particular style (or the clothes for it, soon though!), I love such a wide variety that I just realized I should start going window shopping!  
❤️I exercise several times a week, I want to be healthy and in good shape and I will work my ass off to get that! (*while also cooking healthy but unhealthy foods*🤫)  
I love dancing and want to learn how to do that at some point too!  
❤️I'm really very much a goofball and love being weird, if making a funny voice or face or strange contorted body movements or anything will make you laugh then I will absolutely do it!  
❤️I like to believe I have high emotional intelligence (even if the regular kind is lacking!❌🧠❌) and will always try to notice moods or changes to make sure that the people around me are doing okay. Anything that I'm able to do to help I will do.  
❤️With that said, communication is *super duper* important to me. If there's something I'm doing that you don't like or if you need help or you're depressed or have something weighing on you, whatever it is, then please tell me. I can't do anything to help or to change and be a better person if you don't let me know what it is. I won't ever judge you for the things you say to me. I will listen and do whatever I can to be a great friend to you.💕  
❤️For the most part I'm an open book, if you are genuinely curious about something about me and want to know it, if you ask I will probably tell you. So long as you are respectful.  
❤️I'm very much a homebody, but I do enjoy going out too. Long walks with someone fun are absolutely amazing!  
❤️Pleaseeeeeeeee for the love of GOD tell me things that interest you!! If you have passion or random knowledge or lore about things, I 👏want👏to👏know👏it👏! Share with me, that makes me happy! And that goes double for my autistic girlies that I know are just brimming with random knowledge!

💕I work from home and do a lot at my computer so I spend a lot of time there, I'll probably be able to reply to any messages fairly quickly unless I get really busy. However I really want to stress that I don't expect that from you, you're not under any obligation to message quickly or often, I totally understand people have different lives and are busy and have other obligations and friends and what have you, so you do you!

💕Here's some random facts about me about things I don't like, just in case you thought I was only positivity and liked everything😁  
😑Monkeys. Like I hate them so much, just annoying little chittering assholes that only cause trouble. Plus they're ugly and I hate how they sound, UGH. (however I have monkeys on some socks and they're cute and I would be perfectly fine with a monkey plushy, just not my first choice!)  
☕Hot chocolate. It's just not my...cup of tea (yeah that's not a pun...), it's too rich for me and I've never liked it no matter how many variations I've tried. If you make it I'll drink it, but it's not my first choice.  
☕Coffee. I'm just not a coffee person. It's too bitter and bland and yes I could put sugar and milk/cream in it but I don't want to have to do that to like something. I can have plain ass tea and that tastes amazing without anything in it. And yes I'll still drink coffee if you make it.  
🍴Chewing noises. I can't stand hearing people eat or chew or make mouth noises. It is the GROSSEST🤮sound in the world to me. Or if I hear you breathing I can't handle that either, it's too much.  
If you're my partner that'd probably be an exception because I'd want to hear the noises your mouth makes, but everyone else NUH UH!

❤️Well that's about it for now, I wrote way more than I ever expected too and for some reason ended on some negatives but it is what it is!😁I tend to love seeing posts that are like this when I look for people to talk to and I figured someone that wants to talk to me might enjoy the same, so why not!😊

❤️If you'd like to talk and develop a wonderful friendship then please send me a message and I'd be happy to hear from you! I hope you are having a lovely day so far and that it keeps getting lovelier!
