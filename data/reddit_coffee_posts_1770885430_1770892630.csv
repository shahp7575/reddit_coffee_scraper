Has anyone recovered from something this complex?","please don't judge I have used chatgpt to make it in a form 

I’m 19 (male) and I feel like I’ve been progressively declining for the last 11+ years. I’m writing everything in detail because I genuinely want to know if someone has experienced something this complex and actually improved.

I’ll explain in order.

1. Before Anxiety Got Severe

Even before anxiety became intense, I was never extremely focused or disciplined. I wasn’t a top student or “outsmarting” others academically, but I could at least study and function somewhat normally.

I always had:

Poor sustained attention

Difficulty executing plans

Could plan very well but never execute

Motivation that came in bursts

Emotional intensity

But after my first sleep paralysis episode, everything started sliding downward.

2. After First Sleep Paralysis

After my first sleep paralysis experience:

My academic performance dropped

I started zoning out heavily in class

My attention span reduced drastically

I couldn’t read long paragraphs unless extremely interested

I couldn’t listen to someone for more than 1 minute without drifting

From there, it feels like my nervous system changed permanently.

3. Current Core Symptoms

A) Severe Anxiety (Mental + Physical)

This is not just overthinking. It is physical.

Chest tightness

Palpitations

Internal shaking

Body shivers randomly

Trembling during arguments

Continued shaking even after conflict ends

Scanning every road and person after arguments (hypervigilance)

Feeling like my brain is an “active spy” scanning everything constantly

Zoning out outside

Stumbling or slipping on small rocks/pebbles

Feeling detached while walking

Fear of crashing if I drive (so I stopped driving bike/car)

Fear of stray dogs biting me

When I get into arguments, my body shakes badly. Even after it ends, I stay in alert mode scanning everything.

Friends say I can be rage-baited in seconds.

My mood can swing within seconds.

B) Sleep Problems (Chronic)

Rarely sleep more than 4–5 hours

Sleep never feels restorative

Brain doesn’t shut off

Body may feel tired but brain stays active

Falling sensations while drifting to sleep

Feeling like the bed is moving

Multiple sleep paralysis episodes

It feels like my body sleeps but my brain remains semi-awake.

C) ADHD-like Symptoms (Severe)

Attention span less than 1 minute

Cannot read long paragraphs

Cannot listen for long

Start skills → quit after a few days

Interest dies quickly once flaw is noticed

Need instant reward (like earning money) or I quit

Extremely impulsive decisions

Do things first, think about consequences later

Overexpressive, talk loudly

Interrupt people

Yapping excessively

Zone out even during prayers (and only pray after parents remind me many times)

Doom scroll 12–14 hours daily

Stay in bed most of the day

Cannot lock in for months

Make detailed plans but never execute

But paradoxically:

My memory for names, incidents, what someone said, dates, is very strong

But I’ll forget basic things like my keys

D) Emotional & Behavioral Issues

Extremely emotional

Emotional dysregulation

Verbal dysregulation

Can’t take criticism — overthink it

OCD traits (wanting things perfect)

Overthinking constantly

Mood swings in seconds

Maladaptive daydreaming (intense scenarios in my head)

Music with heavy bass energizes me strongly. Sad music drops my mood quickly.

E) Physical Performance & Confidence

Can’t catch a ball properly in cricket

Can’t shoot properly in football

Not good at e-sports (get eliminated quickly)

Lost confidence in driving

Feel like I will crash into someone

I genuinely feel like I am failing in everything.

4. Medication History

Currently on Reline (SSRI) — 15 days in, no noticeable change yet.

Tried:

Alprazolam (Alp):

Day 1: Slept after 1 hour

Day 2: Couldn’t sleep even 3 hours after taking it

Ritalin:

Once made me fall asleep for 20 minutes

Not consistent

Vyvanse:

Increased physical anxiety symptoms

Tea/Coffee (caffeine):

Increases anxiety and wired feeling

My system feels extremely sensitive to stimulation.

5. The Biggest Issue

It feels like:

My nervous system is permanently stuck in fight-or-flight

My brain never powers down

My body and brain are not syncing

I have never experienced true restorative sleep

I have never experienced sustained focus

I have never been disciplined consistently

I feel like I’m just failing again and again.

6. What I’m Asking

Has anyone experienced something like this combination:

Severe anxiety (mental + physical)

ADHD symptoms

OCD traits

Maladaptive daydreaming

Hypervigilance

Sleep paralysis

Falling sensations at sleep onset

Doom scrolling addiction

Emotional dysregulation

Fear of driving

Fear of dogs

Shaking during stress

Brain constantly scanning environment

never uploaded before. probably should speak to a couples councillor before coming to the internet but hey ho!

**TLDR; do I have an unpaid day off for childcare despite only working 2 days a week compared to the father that works a salaried full-time role?** 

i \[27F\] and my partner \[30M\] raise a child together \[3M\]. I work 2 days a week where I am one of the management staff of a local coffee shop, whereas he is a full-time sales rep for a retail company (less exciting than it sounds, it’s storage).

During 1-2 days of the week we will send my son off to his grandparents for the night, as I start work so early in the morning. they are our only childcare and have taken a trip abroad to celebrate a birthday, so we have no one to look after our child. 

this is where the problems seep in. Neither wants the day off unpaid as it is so last minute. Bf thinks my job is less important because I only do two days, and it’s easier for me to have the time off (unpaid) due to how little I work. I said that it was completely unjustified that I should lose quite a large chunk in my paycheck (biweekly pay). I can only just afford to live off this and entertain our son with this money. we do our finances quite seperate if it isn’t for bills etc (where he will just send me the money as bills are in my name). 

This man does nothing but complain about how little opportunities this job is giving him, and always brings negative opinions about his job. He is salaried, not a crazy salary but enough to justify taking a singular day off unpaid for childcare. 

i told him he was being misogynistic in his opinions. he said they were valid. I can’t wrap my head around the thoughts of ‘does my job matter less when I am more important within my role than he is‘. 

this opinion he has been carrying since I started back after maternity leave. not only do I run shifts, be a mother 5 other days of the week and also am studying towards a degree to get us out of this quite dire financial situation we are in. I’m feeling very shunted. hes a terrific father, very hands on, but nothing else going for him in his life as he fails to take the ‘bull by the horns’ as it were. however these outdated statements come out of the woodwork and take me by surprise! 

should I just take the L and have the day off as an unpaid sick day, or should I stand up to him properly and put my foot down?",1,1770892471.0,makemychoice,0,1.0,False

Hi redditors at casualph, Gumawa ako ng new account para lang talaga mag-rant kasi grabe naman yung mga pambabatikos na binabato sa aming mga immigration officer. Halos everyday tuwing nagbubukas ako ng social media. Palagi nalang meron reklamo sa bureau of immigration. Palagi nalang kami laman ng news halos weekly. 

Gusto ko lang naman magrant dito kasi alam ko na mas matalino mga reddit user kaysa sa ""blue app"", Yes totoo meron talaga mga corrupt at kupal na nagpopowertrip na mga officer. PERO HINDI NAMAN LAHAT! Marami pa naman kami na nagtratrabaho lang ng marangal at ginagawa lang yung dapat gawin. Sa totoo lang dumami talaga ang mga case ng offloaded passenger last year up to currently. Kasi meron utos sa taas na mas higpitan ang interview at double check ng mga documents dahil sobrang taas ng human trafficking case. Andami na din nadedeport na kababayan natin sa iba't ibang bahagi ng mundo.

Exposed ko lang din yung mga co-workers ko na sobrang lalakas magpowertrip! If kasama kayo sa group ng mga offloaded passenger sa fb, Meron doon sikat ""Matabang maliit mataray na babaeng officer"" yes kilala ko siya minsan ka shift pa pero hindi namin siya kaibigan. kawork oo pero kaibigan hindi. Sobrang lakas magpowertrip nun. Like kapag naiinsecure siya sa mga babae na passenger like kapag sobrang ganda or may afam. grabe siya magquestion ng mga passenger tapos inooffload niya. Andami niya na report at ilang beses na siya napatawag sa HR pero hindi mapaalis kasi malakas yung backer. Yung mga corrupt na IO naman na naguunder the table naman at ""escort service"" mga hayop na yun nirereport namin din pero walang nangyayari. Ang dami ko kilala mga nag-eescort service lalo na mga may offload record na pax. Pero grabi maningil 100k-250k depende sa case. Sa totoo lang kung gusto talaga mawala yung ganitong mga officer na corrupt at malakas magpowertrip dapat meron magpanggap na NBI na pasahero para mahuli sila.

  
Samantala kaming magkakaibigan na officer, Right process always. Sorry sa mga na-offload ko just doing my job po, Pero di naman ako masamang tao. Yung mga group passenger, Automatic Stamp! Yung mga pamilya na gusto lang magdisneyland sa hongkong or gala sa taiwan. Automatic Stamp! Yung mga couples na travel sa thailand, japan at sokor. Stamp! Alam ko din naman ang gastos ng mga pax eh. tapos ma-offload lang diba. Kung makakakita kayo ng tatlong magkakawork sa terminal 3 na madaldal kami yun magkakaibigan hahahahaahaha, Siguro kung inaaccept namin yung mga coffee ng mga pax na nastamp ko dahil sa sobrang tuwa. Siguro may diabetes at magugulatin na ko. Pinalaki ako ng lola ko na maging totoo at huwag manapak ng ibang tao. Mahal ko yung work ko sa totoo lang pero minsan nakakainis na nadadamay talaga kaming mga matitino para tuloy kaming mga traffic enforcer or pulis na meron mga nangongotong at meron matitino.

Every now and then, you reach out and touch the screen. Tip the balance a little. Nudge something. Maybe to prove you belong. Maybe to tilt things in your favour. Maybe just to see what happens when you disturb the ecosystem.

But you’re never actually part of the wilderness.

You’re just outside it. Watching. Observing patterns. Coffee in hand. Slightly detached. Slightly entertained.

\---> [German Version](https://meiersworld.de/actionfiguren-selfies-und-verbrannte-milliarden-die-teuerste-prokrastination-der-welt)

I’m sitting at my desk, scrolling through LinkedIn. Between the usual self-optimization confessions and people repackaging their third career pivot as a “transformative journey,” I see them everywhere: AI-generated images. People rendered as action figures. As Renaissance paintings. As anime characters. As Barbies. As whatever the next viral trend demands.

And I can’t help but ask: Have we lost our minds?

Not because it isn’t funny—it is. For about three seconds. That’s how long it takes to like and scroll on. But what lingers afterward? Nothing. No added value, no insight, no creation of meaning. Just a fleeting dopamine hit in the endless stream of digital self-absorption.

We’ve been handed one of the most powerful tools humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence. And what do we do with it? Turn ourselves into Pixar characters.

It’s like handing Gutenberg the printing press and watching him start churning out toilet paper.

# The Economic Void

Let’s get to what really bothers me. This isn’t about being a killjoy—I’ll gladly grant everyone their three seconds of joy. But we’re constantly talking about procrastination in the workplace, productivity, economic competitiveness, efficiency. Meanwhile, millions of people burn through computing power, energy, and their own time every day to generate images that will be forgotten by tomorrow.

Data centers don’t run on good intentions. They run on electricity. Every prompt, every image generation, every “make me look like a Viking” consumes real energy. The kind of energy we scrutinize fiercely in every other context.

There’s a great term for this: **Green Prompting—the mindful use of AI resources**. The idea is to use AI consciously and sustainably. To pause before hitting *Generate* and ask: Do I really need this? Does it add value? Will it matter beyond this moment?

The AI image trends are the exact opposite. They’re the antithesis of responsible tech use. They’re digital disposable cups—pretty for one sip, then trash.

# Procrastination with an Alibi

This is where it gets uncomfortable, because generating these images masquerades as engaging with technology. It *feels* productive. You’re “using AI.” You’re “ahead of the curve.” You post the result, get likes, and the illusion of accomplishment grows stronger.

But it’s the most sophisticated form of procrastination we’ve ever seen. Procrastination Deluxe. Because it dresses up as progress.

We used to procrastinate by tidying our desks or fetching a third cup of coffee. Now, we use cutting-edge technology to create impressively pointless images—and call it “exploring AI.” It’s like driving a Porsche in circles in a parking garage for an hour and calling it a “driving experience.”

# What Would Actually Make a Difference

I’m not just here to complain—I have a point. The same technology that turns our faces into action figures can create things of lasting value.

A text analysis that helps an author refine their style. Research that saves a journalist hours in the library. A book cover a self-publisher couldn’t otherwise afford. A translation that makes a text accessible to readers in another language. A summary that makes a complex topic understandable.

All of these consume tokens, energy, and computing time too. But they *give something back*. Value. Meaning. Something that outlasts a fleeting smile and a like.

Economically, the difference is clear: One is consumption, the other is investment. One fizzles out, the other endures. One creates waste, the other creates worth.

# The Real Question

Over the past few months, I’ve realized that the AI debate isn’t about the technology. It’s about *us*. Our priorities. The question of whether we’ll use a tool capable of almost anything to do almost nothing.

The image trends aren’t an AI problem. They’re a symptom of our collective inability to handle powerful tools responsibly. We did the same with the internet, social media, smartphones. Each time, we first used the technology for the lowest common denominator before slowly grasping its true potential.

Maybe that’s just how it goes. Maybe humanity needs to generate millions of action figure selfies before understanding where this technology’s real power lies.

But maybe we could speed up the process a little. By pausing before typing the next “make me a medieval knight” prompt and asking: Is there *anything* I could do with this incredible technology that will still matter tomorrow?

Has anyone recovered from something this complex?","please don't judge I have used chatgpt to make it in a form 

I’m 19 (male) and I feel like I’ve been progressively declining for the last 11+ years. I’m writing everything in detail because I genuinely want to know if someone has experienced something this complex and actually improved.

I’ll explain in order.

1. Before Anxiety Got Severe

Even before anxiety became intense, I was never extremely focused or disciplined. I wasn’t a top student or “outsmarting” others academically, but I could at least study and function somewhat normally.

I always had:

Poor sustained attention

Difficulty executing plans

Could plan very well but never execute

Motivation that came in bursts

Emotional intensity

But after my first sleep paralysis episode, everything started sliding downward.

2. After First Sleep Paralysis

After my first sleep paralysis experience:

My academic performance dropped

I started zoning out heavily in class

My attention span reduced drastically

I couldn’t read long paragraphs unless extremely interested

I couldn’t listen to someone for more than 1 minute without drifting

From there, it feels like my nervous system changed permanently.

3. Current Core Symptoms

A) Severe Anxiety (Mental + Physical)

This is not just overthinking. It is physical.

Chest tightness

Palpitations

Internal shaking

Body shivers randomly

Trembling during arguments

Continued shaking even after conflict ends

Scanning every road and person after arguments (hypervigilance)

Feeling like my brain is an “active spy” scanning everything constantly

Zoning out outside

Stumbling or slipping on small rocks/pebbles

Feeling detached while walking

Fear of crashing if I drive (so I stopped driving bike/car)

Fear of stray dogs biting me

When I get into arguments, my body shakes badly. Even after it ends, I stay in alert mode scanning everything.

Friends say I can be rage-baited in seconds.

My mood can swing within seconds.

B) Sleep Problems (Chronic)

Rarely sleep more than 4–5 hours

Sleep never feels restorative

Brain doesn’t shut off

Body may feel tired but brain stays active

Falling sensations while drifting to sleep

Feeling like the bed is moving

Multiple sleep paralysis episodes

It feels like my body sleeps but my brain remains semi-awake.

C) ADHD-like Symptoms (Severe)

Attention span less than 1 minute

Cannot read long paragraphs

Cannot listen for long

Start skills → quit after a few days

Interest dies quickly once flaw is noticed

Need instant reward (like earning money) or I quit

Extremely impulsive decisions

Do things first, think about consequences later

Overexpressive, talk loudly

Interrupt people

Yapping excessively

Zone out even during prayers (and only pray after parents remind me many times)

Doom scroll 12–14 hours daily

Stay in bed most of the day

Cannot lock in for months

Make detailed plans but never execute

But paradoxically:

My memory for names, incidents, what someone said, dates, is very strong

But I’ll forget basic things like my keys

D) Emotional & Behavioral Issues

Extremely emotional

Emotional dysregulation

Verbal dysregulation

Can’t take criticism — overthink it

OCD traits (wanting things perfect)

Overthinking constantly

Mood swings in seconds

Maladaptive daydreaming (intense scenarios in my head)

Music with heavy bass energizes me strongly. Sad music drops my mood quickly.

E) Physical Performance & Confidence

Can’t catch a ball properly in cricket

Can’t shoot properly in football

Not good at e-sports (get eliminated quickly)

Lost confidence in driving

Feel like I will crash into someone

I genuinely feel like I am failing in everything.

4. Medication History

Currently on Reline (SSRI) — 15 days in, no noticeable change yet.

Tried:

Alprazolam (Alp):

Day 1: Slept after 1 hour

Day 2: Couldn’t sleep even 3 hours after taking it

Ritalin:

Once made me fall asleep for 20 minutes

Not consistent

Vyvanse:

Increased physical anxiety symptoms

Tea/Coffee (caffeine):

Increases anxiety and wired feeling

My system feels extremely sensitive to stimulation.

5. The Biggest Issue

It feels like:

My nervous system is permanently stuck in fight-or-flight

My brain never powers down

My body and brain are not syncing

I have never experienced true restorative sleep

I have never experienced sustained focus

I have never been disciplined consistently

I feel like I’m just failing again and again.

6. What I’m Asking

Has anyone experienced something like this combination:

Severe anxiety (mental + physical)

ADHD symptoms

OCD traits

Maladaptive daydreaming

Hypervigilance

Sleep paralysis

Falling sensations at sleep onset

Doom scrolling addiction

Emotional dysregulation

Fear of driving

Fear of dogs

Shaking during stress

Brain constantly scanning environment

If yes:

Did you recover or significantly improve?

I've recently started learning Thai and I had a simple need: being able to manually select the characters I want to review and quiz myself on them.

*No account to create, no imposed learning path, just cards and a quiz.*

I looked around but couldn't really find an app that does this simply, so I decided to build my own. The app is not meant to be a multiple choice quiz for now. So grab your notebooks and pens.

>**Heads up, this is a work in progress (WIP).**

The core features are there and fully functional, but the app will keep evolving. 

Link: [https://thai-flashcards.app](https://thai-flashcards.app)



*What it does :*

* Browse Thai characters as flashcards
* English / French supported
* Select the ones you want to review
* Configure and launch a randomized quiz based on your selection
* Navigate, Pause/Resume, Show answer during the quiz
* Results at the end
* That's it.

*Good to know :*

* Fully responsive desktop/tablet/mobile
* No sign-up, no account required
* The app is installable (PWA): from your browser, add it to your home screen
* Works 100% offline
* Free, no ads

*Here are some planned improvements :*

* Rework of all UI elements as I'm not really happy with them yet
* Detailed pop-up for each card (including sound, different fonts, etc.)
* Settings: dark/light theme, global font choice
* More advanced display filters (live/dead/obsolete, final sound, position)
* Proper contact form for suggestions, bugs, improvements or anything else
* Adding numbers, tones, the 20 maai malaai words and other language specifics (ร, อ, etc.)



I want to keep the app 100% free.

If there are actually regular users down the line, I'll figure out a way to help cover costs (mainly the server). Probably with a ""buy me a coffee"" button or something like that somewhere.

I don't want any third-party intrusion like ads or pop-ups that would ruin the experience.



*If you give it a try and have any feedback, corrections or improvement ideas, I'd be more than happy to hear them. Feel free to drop a comment here, send me a DM or use ""Contact"" directly from there.*

1r2pq2s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2pq2s,[Hiring] Sales reps for restaurant POS startup | ₹3K/sale + stipend,"# Restaurant POS, fully built, already in use. Now hiring sales.

We built FinixoDine. It has everything a restaurant/cafe might need. Billing, QR table ordering, Kitchen Display, Inventory with AI-powered predictions, Swiggy/Zomato integration, OCR for purchase receipts, Analytics e.t.c you name it. Not a landing page with a waitlist, it's live in a restaurant right now.

Website: google FinixoDine

## Where we are

Early stage and being honest about it. 1 live restaurant, a few more in pipeline. We're based in Hyderabad and Delhi, actively doing sales ourselves alongside building the product, walking into restaurants, doing demos, learning what clicks. Now we're looking for people who want to do this with us.

The plan is for you to join us on field visits initially, see how the conversations go, and then start running your own demos as you get comfortable. Not a ""here's a PDF, good luck"" situation, we figure this out together.

## The deal

| | Details |
|---|---|
| Commission | ₹3,000 per closed sale (~30% of annual plan value) |
| Activity stipend | ₹5,000-7,000/month for hitting 15 qualified demos |
| Work mode | Field sales (restaurant visits) + remote outreach |
| Location | Doesn't matter |
| Time commitment | Part-time OK, full-time preferred |
| Training | First week is shadowing real sales conversations with us. You learn by being there, not from a slideshow |

## The math

- 5 sales/month → ₹20K/month (₹15K commission + stipend)
- 10 sales/month → ₹37K/month
- 15+/month → ₹50K+ and we'd want to talk about equity

## Why now

- You'd be rep #1 or #2. The plan is for early people who perform well to grow into leading the sales team, not report to someone we hire above you later
- Equity is something we want to offer to people who show consistent results over a few months
- Fixed base pay is planned once things pick up. The goal is to build a real team, not stay commission-only forever
- You'd be learning B2B SaaS sales at the ground level alongside the founders. Good experience regardless of where you go after

## Why you should take this seriously

- Product is live and working 
- We're not outsourcing the hard part to you. We're selling too, daily. You'll see that from Day 1
- Commission is per sale, tracked transparently, paid without delays
- No hiring pipeline or HR layer, you talk to us directly

## Would be a good fit if you're

- Comfortable striking up a conversation with a restaurant owner
- A college student or recent grad looking for real-world sales experience
- Someone from F&B/hospitality who already has restaurant contacts
- A freelancer looking for something with actual upside

## Might not be the best fit if you

- Need a guaranteed salary from Day 1, we're not there yet, being upfront about that

## How to apply

1. Your city
2. One line on why this interests you, it could be just money, that's valid
3. Part-time or full-time?

1r2pq1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LawCrustLegal/comments/1r2pq1c/what_are_some_of_the_most_common_legal_issues/,What are some of the most common legal issues that small businesses may encounter?,"Imagine you have finally launched your dream business. The website is live, the coffee is brewing, and the first customers are walking through the door. Then, out of nowhere, you receive a formal letter claiming your logo looks too much like another brand, or a former employee files a claim for unpaid overtime you thought was settled.  
  
Running a company is like sailing a boat. While you focus on the wind and the waves your sales and customers there are underwater rocks that can sink you if you aren't looking. These rocks are the common legal issues that most entrepreneurs face.  
  
The most frequent hurdles involve contract disputes, employment laws, tax compliance, and intellectual property. Often, these problems start small. A simple handshake deal or a missing document might seem fine today, but it can turn into an expensive headache a year from now. Being aware of these issues is the first step toward keeping your business safe.  
  
**1. Navigating Contract Disputes**  
  
Contracts are the rules of the game. They tell everyone exactly what to expect. Without a written agreement, people often remember conversations differently. This is why ""handshake deals"" are risky; if a supplier fails to deliver, it is very hard to prove they broke a promise.  
  
How it works: A breach of contract happens when one side doesn't follow the written promise. A good document lists what is being provided, the cost, and what happens if things go wrong. Think of it like a recipe: if everyone follows the steps, the meal is great. If people guess, you get a mess.  
  
Real-world perspective: A supplier promises delivery in 10 days but shows up after 30. If your legal agreement doesn't mention penalties for delays, you might lose money without any way to get it back.  
  
Fact: Disputes over unclear terms are the leading cause of business litigation for small firms.  
  
**2. Managing Employment and Labor Issues**  
  
Hiring your first team member is a huge milestone, but it opens a world of strict rules. Small businesses often struggle with worker misclassification treating someone like a freelancer when the law says they are an employee or lacking a clear employee handbook.  
  
**How it works**: Labor laws protect workers regarding pay, breaks, and safety. If you treat a full-time worker as a freelancer to save on paperwork, the government might see this as a violation. This can lead to heavy fines and back-taxes that could have been avoided with the right setup.  
  
**Real-world perspective:** An owner might hire a friend without a formal employment contract. If that friend later feels they were treated unfairly, the lack of documentation makes it much harder for the owner to defend their actions in a wrongful termination claim.  
  
**3. Handling Tax and Compliance Problems**  
  
Governments expect accurate reporting and timely payments. While taxes aren't the most exciting part of owning a business, regulatory compliance is what keeps your doors open. Mistakes here usually lead to ""frozen"" accounts or expensive interest charges.  
  
**How it works:** You must manage payroll tax, sales tax, and local registrations. Missing a deadline or filing an incorrect return triggers an automatic penalty. Even if the mistake was an accident, the tax office rarely gives ""free passes.""  
  
**Real-world perspective:** A retailer collects sales tax but fails to file the returns properly. Even with zero bad intent, the authorities can impose fines that wipe out the month's entire profit. Staying tax compliant keeps your operations stress-free.  
  
**4. Protecting Intellectual Property**  
  
Your brand, logo, and unique ideas are your Intellectual Property (IP). They are valuable assets. If you don't protect them, someone else could copy your work, or you might unknowingly infringe on a giant corporation's rights.  
  
**How it works:** Registering a trademark or copyright is like putting a fence around your house. It tells the world, ""This belongs to me."" If someone climbs over the fence, you have a legal right to stop them. Without the fence, it is much harder to keep people out.  
  
**Real-world perspective:** A startup builds a strong brand name but never registers the trademark. Later, another company claims they owned it first. The startup is then forced to spend thousands on rebranding, which confuses all their loyal customers.  
  
**Micro Takeaway**

Most legal problems in small businesses start small, but they grow fast if ignored. Prevention is always cheaper than a legal cure.  
  
Staying ahead of regulatory hurdles is much easier when you have a partner who builds a strong legal foundation for your steady growth.

I say this in hopes of finding someone who is understanding and not quick to judge. I consider myself a happy individual with great friends but, my family is very broken and draining to the point I no longer interact with them unless it is an emergency. 

I wish things weren't this way but they are and I lived long enough to know you cannot change other people and this is the current state of things.

With that said, if you can overlook this ""flaw"", I have been told I am quite the catch. I know that is a bold statement but you are just going to have to get to know me and decide for yourself.

Some basics about me is that I like to exercise, mainly so I can stay in shape and eat more without feeling guilty but also to live a long life and still be functional in old age. I am currently 37 but definitely do not look or feel it.

As far as looks, I have been told I look like a cute kpop idol before but I am not Korean, even though I get that a lot. I do happen to like kpop though and will forever be a NewJeans and Dreamcatcher fan. I also like video games and anime to name a few of my other hobbies and I have been to conventions before too.

As far as what I am looking for, I like someone that also tries to take care of herself and is considered a catch too. Hopefully, we have some hobbies in common for us to connect but it's not a deal breaker if not. I'm always down to try something new.

The end goal is to meet someone that I can build with but open to something short term if it works out that way too. Not everything needs to be permanent to be meaningful.

I try once to use 19 grams but to run only 35 milliliters of water, using the 1x button, but it extract the coffee in 10-15 seconds and it was really acidic and bad tasting.

They don't teach you that depression in men often looks like nothing at all. Or that the person holding the rope is also drowning, just quieter.

They don't teach you that gratitude can become its own cage. That ""we've been through so much"" can become a reason you can't leave, not the reason you stay.

Today I am going to stop taking my medication to increase the chances of dying soon (the heart issuse isn't the reason for not being able to drive)

22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I've planned my suicide and I've never been happier. Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

Today she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about.

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

I’m 28F and hoping to make some new friends. I’ve been working as a personal assistant for years, and lately I’ve realized most of my life revolves around work. I’ve been a PA for my boss for a long time, and now I’m also kind of a PA for my boyfriend too. I’m good at organizing other people’s lives, but I think I forgot to build my own social circle along the way.

I’m really into crime cases and true crime discussions (the psychology behind them fascinates me), I love exploring good cafés, and I enjoy long conversations about random topics. I can be a bit intense when I’m interested in something, but I’m also a good listener.

Lately I’ve been feeling a little lonely and would love to connect with people outside of my daily routine. If you’re someone who enjoys deep chats, sharing life stories, discussing crime documentaries, or even just talking about your favorite coffee spots, feel free to message me.

I’m just looking for genuine connections and good conversations.",1,1770890197.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

The first rain of the season fell hard, drumming against the rooftops and soaking the streets. Most people had taken shelter, umbrellas shielding them from the sudden downpour. All except for one figure, who moved like he owned the rain itself. 

 Ej didn’t care about getting wet. He never did. He moved with purpose, his steps precise, shoulders squared, and expression unreadable, like someone who had already mastered everything life could throw at him. Yet, there was something undeniably human in the way he glanced at the flooded streets before leaping effortlessly over a puddle. 

At the corner café, Althea ducked under the awning, shaking out her umbrella. She had hoped the rain would stop before she left school, but it didn’t matter, she couldn’t avoid him. Not him. Ej. The rumor mill had painted him as untouchable, brilliant, impossibly calm under pressure. And yet, seeing him in the rain, hair plastered to his forehead, jacket clinging to his form…

 she noticed things no one else did. The small twitch of his fingers, the faint furrow between his brows, the way he tilted his head as if measuring the world in silence. He didn’t notice her at first. His eyes were on something in the distance, probably a problem he planned to fix before it even existed. Then, finally, he glanced toward her.

“Can I help you?” His voice was quiet, but it carried that subtle authority, the kind that made people listen even when they didn’t want to.

Althea blinked. “Uh… I… I’m just waiting for the rain to—”

“Stand still?” he finished for her, smirking faintly, though his eyes softened ever so slightly. “Don’t worry. It’s not going anywhere.”

There was something strange about him. He could command a room with a glance, a word, a simple gesture, but here, now, with rain dripping off his jacket, he seemed… just a person. Not a hero, not a legend, not the Martial Omnarch of All. Just a guy.

Althea found herself staring longer than she intended. And maybe, just maybe, he noticed.

For a moment, the rain was nothing but a backdrop, the city nothing but a blur, and all that mattered was the quiet tension of two people standing under a storm neither had planned to face. Then he tilted his head again, smirk tugging at the corner of his lips, and spoke:

“Coffee. My treat. Unless you plan to stand in the rain all evening.”

Althea couldn’t help but laugh, her nerves twisting into something she couldn’t name. “Sure… why not?”

As they stepped into the warm light of the café, neither of them realized how small moments could grow into something far larger. Something unstoppable.",1,1770890006.0,story,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I had an especially hard therapy session and by the evening I was just craving doughnuts. I got one each for my family and the shop placed an extra donut in there since it was delayed. I ate my doughnut immediately and then munched half of the extra one. Both my daughter and my husband left their doughnuts for today.

  
I came to the office and was considering ordering some breakfast, even though I had already had cereal with protein powder at home. And then I noticed a pack of chocolate bauli croissants. So I ate 3 of those, one after the other, and a pair of biscoff biscuits with  a cup of coffee.

I'm here for accountability, because I was doing well, but my therapist told me to analyse how I feel and try to journal the sensations.

  
It was a bit like.... Therapy, stress, sadness.... more sadness over time.... Chocolate Idea. Build-up until unbearable. Order. Anticipation. Eating, creamy sweet. Not enough, want more. Stop licking box. Go to bed. Wake up. Still want more. No sadness. Just want more. Food Food Food. Drive to work, cannot focus. Food food. Biscuits. Crunchy. Hmm. Gone, did nothing. Croissants.

The problem: every AI headshot tool I've tried gives wildly different backgrounds and lighting for each person. One looks like they're in a corporate office, another looks like a coffee shop, and the third is in some weird blurred beige void.

What I need:

- Consistent style/lighting across all team members

- Professional but not overly formal

- Same general background vibe (doesn't need to be identical, just cohesive)

- Ideally something where I can set parameters once and apply to everyone

Has anyone dealt with this? Is there a tool that lets you lock in a specific style/environment and then generate multiple people with that same look?

I've tried the usual suspects (HeadshotPro, Aragon) but they seem optimized for individual use. Saw [Looktara](http://looktara.com/) mentioned somewhere does that handle team consistency or is it also single-person focused?

I’m pre-med and every job I’ve taken has been intentional — outpatient, inpatient, clinics, even pre-hospital on an ambulance. I love medicine. I’ve worked hard for my clinical hours and I care deeply about becoming a good physician.

Out of everything, the ED has always been my favorite. I thrive in fast-paced environments. I love critical thinking and team dynamics. So when I transferred for grad school and got hired at a local ER as a ED tech, I was genuinely excited.

At first, I loved it.

Then the culture revealed itself.

The nurses were not just blunt or burned out — they were mean. I was laughed at in front of other staff for not knowing certain things. Instead of teaching, they embarrassed me. Instead of correcting me privately, they made it a public spectacle.

If I tried to participate socially, that didn’t help either. I once wrote something harmless and cute on our community whiteboard and it was erased almost immediately. Small thing, sure. But it felt symbolic — like I wasn’t allowed to take up space.

I even tried to fit in the only way I knew how. On my student budget, I would buy food for the nurses. Coffee, snacks, little things just to contribute and show appreciation. No one ever really said thank you. One time, they literally moved the food I bought and set it back down in front of me at the nurses station. No one touched it. It was humiliating.

The worst part was overhearing them talk about me when they didn’t realize I was nearby. I was in a patient room behind a curtain and could hear them saying genuinely cruel things about me. Not constructive criticism. Just personal attacks. I stood there frozen.

I went to management twice. I explained what was happening. Nothing changed. No mediation. No accountability. Just silence.

Then I was fired.

The reason given? “Clocking in too early too many times.”

We’re talking a few minutes here and there. I was never formally written up. Never sat down and told this was a serious issue that would cost me my job. Suddenly it became “stealing time from the company.”

They treated me like I had committed some kind of crime.

It felt like a technicality. A convenient justification to remove someone they didn’t like.

By the end, I genuinely felt like public enemy #1 — and I still don’t understand why. I worked hard. I showed up eager. I asked questions because I wanted to learn. I cared about patients.

I’ve worked in multiple medical settings over six years and never experienced anything like this. I understand burnout. I understand stress. But bullying disguised as “culture” and termination disguised as “policy enforcement” is something else.

I still love emergency medicine. But I’ll never forget how small and disposable that environment made me feel.

Has anyone else experienced something like this in healthcare? Is this just certain departments? Or did I walk straight into a toxic ER?

1r2p23e,https://i.redd.it/6uha1xt591jg1.jpeg,Clinic vs Home Treatment: Which Is Better for Acne Scars?,"Whether you have stood in front of the mirror, zoomed in on the skin, or breathed a heavy sigh at the sight of the marks, you know that you are not alone in this grievance, especially for those looking for an [***Acne Scar Treatment in Jayanagar***](https://aarnaclinic.com/best-acne-scar-treatment-in-jayanagar/)***.*** The great debate begins about whether home remedies can do the trick or whether a visit to a clinic is worth the time, effort, and money. And then comes the daunting debate on whether Acne Scar Treatment in Jayanagar is expensive or not. Let’s analyze the situation the easiest way possible.

**So, What Are Acne Scars Anyway?**

First things first — acne scars are not just *“leftover pimples.”* They are tiny changes in your skin caused when acne heals improperly. Some are deep, some are shallow, some look like dark spots, and some change your skin texture.

Once they form, they don’t magically disappear with face wash and hope. That’s why treatment matters.

**Home Remedies: Easy, Cheap, and Everywhere**

Home treatments are tempting. Aloe vera, lemon juice, coffee scrubs, DIY masks — we’ve all tried them.

The good part?

They are affordable, easy to find, and feel comforting.

But here's the honest truth:

Home remedies typically only work for light scarring and skin luminosity. They don’t solve heavy scarring problems. In fact, wrong ingredients may even cause irritation in your skin, making your scarring worst.

So, while they’re nice for maintenance, they’re not miracle workers.

**Clinic Treatments: Professional and Personalized**

Now, let's talk about treatments. If you visit any clinic, like Aarna Clinic, the doctors do not just look at your face and recommend anything and everything. They examine your lifestyle and the depth of your scars.

Dermatologist there is known for creating treatment plans that actually fit the patient, not just the problem. This may include procedures like microneedling, lasers, peels, or PRP.

These treatments work deeper in the skin, which is why results are faster and more visible.

Yes, it sounds serious. But it’s also safer when done by trained experts.

**Let’s Talk About Cost (Without Fear)**

Many people hesitate because they worry about [***Acne Scar Treatment Cost in Jayanagar***](https://aarnaclinic.com/best-acne-scar-treatment-in-jayanagar/)***.*** But here’s something important: clinic treatments are not “one price fits all.”

Your cost depends on:

* Type of scars
* Number of sessions
* Technology used
* Your skin response

At Aarna Clinic, patients are clearly explained what they need and why. No surprise bills. No confusing packages.

And when you compare it with years of buying products that don’t work, professional care often saves money in the long run.

**So, Which One Should You Choose?**

Choose home care if:

* Your scars are very mild
* You want basic skin maintenance
* You’re patient with slow results

Choose a clinic if:

* Your scars are deep or old
* You want visible improvement
* You’re tired of trial and error
* You’re serious about skin health

Most people who try ***Acne Scar Treatment in Jayanagar*** at a trusted clinic wish they had started earlier.

**Final Thoughts**

Home remedies are like home workouts — helpful, but limited. Clinic treatments are like personal trainers — guided, effective, and goal-focused.

If acne scars affect your confidence, your photos, or even your mood, it’s okay to seek professional help. Your skin deserves care, not experiments.

And sometimes, the best glow-up begins with one good decision.

Yeah. We've all been there. I spent years wondering why I kept falling into the same patterns despite *knowing* better. Turns out, there's actual science behind why change is so damn hard, and it's not because you lack willpower.

After diving deep into research, podcasts, and books from neuroscientists and behavioral experts, I finally get it. Your brain is literally wired to keep you stuck. But here's the good news: once you understand how habits actually work, you can hack the system.

**The real issue? Your brain loves efficiency.**

Every habit you have, good or bad, exists because your brain found a shortcut. It's trying to save energy. When you repeat a behavior enough times, it gets hardwired into your basal ganglia, the part of your brain that runs on autopilot. This is why you can brush your teeth while thinking about your grocery list.

But this same mechanism keeps you reaching for your phone when you're bored, procrastinating when you should be working, or falling back into toxic relationship patterns. Your brain doesn't distinguish between helpful and harmful habits. It just sees: this is familiar, this is safe, let's keep doing it.

**Here's what actually works:**

**Identify your habit loop.** Every habit has three parts: cue, routine, reward. Let's say you stress eat. The cue might be feeling anxious, the routine is eating junk food, the reward is temporary comfort. [""The Power of Habit""](https://ia803102.us.archive.org/35/items/CharlesDuhigg.ThePowerOfHabit_201808/Charles-Duhigg.The-Power-of-Habit.pdf) by Charles Duhigg breaks this down incredibly well. Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who spent years researching the neuroscience of habits. This book completely changed how I see my own behavior. The key insight? You can't eliminate cues or cravings, but you can change the routine. When I feel stressed now, I go for a walk instead of raiding the pantry. Same cue, same reward (stress relief), different routine.

**Make the new habit stupid easy.** Seriously, embarrassingly easy. Want to read more? Start with literally one page per day. James Clear's **""Atomic Habits""** emphasizes this hard. Clear is a behavior change expert whose work has been featured everywhere from TIME to the New York Times. His core principle is that tiny changes compound into remarkable results. The book is insanely practical, no fluff, just actionable strategies. He talks about ""habit stacking,"" where you attach a new habit to an existing one. Like, ""After I pour my morning coffee, I'll meditate for two minutes."" Your brain already knows the coffee routine, so piggybacking makes it stick.

**Track your progress visually.** There's something weirdly satisfying about marking an X on a calendar. **Habitica** is an app that turns your life into a role playing game. You create an avatar and earn rewards for completing tasks and building habits. It sounds goofy but gamification actually works because it hijacks your brain's reward system in a positive way. Watching your character level up gives you that dopamine hit you're craving.

If you want something that connects all these dots from habit research and behavioral science into a personalized plan, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) pulls from sources like the books above, expert insights, and psychology research to create structured audio learning tailored to goals like ""break procrastination as someone with ADHD"" or ""build consistency when motivation fades.""

Built by Columbia University grads and former Google experts, it generates adaptive learning plans based on your specific struggles. You can ask its virtual coach Freedia about your patterns, and it recommends content that fits. The depth is adjustable too, from 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks. Plus you can pick voices that keep you engaged, like a smoky, sarcastic tone or something more energetic during commutes.

**Understand your triggers on a deeper level.** Sometimes our habits are covering up something bigger. [""The Body Keeps the Score""](https://ia601604.us.archive.org/35/items/the-body-keeps-the-score-pdf/The-Body-Keeps-the-Score-PDF.pdf) by Bessel van der Kolk explores how trauma lives in our nervous system and drives our behavior. Van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who's been studying trauma for over 30 years. This isn't a light read, but it's genuinely eye opening if you keep repeating patterns that don't make logical sense. Turns out, your body remembers things your conscious mind has forgotten.

For emotional regulation and understanding why you do what you do, **Finch** is surprisingly helpful. It's a self care app with a cute little bird companion, but underneath it's teaching you CBT techniques and helping you identify patterns in your mood and behavior.

**Get comfortable with discomfort.** The biggest reason we slip back is because new habits feel weird and uncomfortable. Your brain interprets ""unfamiliar"" as ""dangerous"" and tries to pull you back to what's known. Expecting this discomfort instead of being surprised by it makes a huge difference. It's not a sign you're failing, it's a sign you're actually changing.

**Build in environmental friction.** Make bad habits harder to do. Delete social media apps from your phone. Put your credit card in a drawer. Sleep in your workout clothes. Sounds basic but environmental design is one of the most underrated behavior change tools.

Look, breaking old patterns isn't about having more discipline or being ""better."" It's about working with your brain instead of against it. You're not broken. You're just human, dealing with a nervous system that evolved to keep you safe by keeping you the same.

The loop breaks when you stop relying on motivation and start building systems that make the right choice the easy choice. It takes time. It takes repetition. But it's absolutely possible.",1,1770888604.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

I want to lay out what happened so it feels real, not like a highlight reel. I first learned about my option at https://www.semaglu.com while reading about clinics and protocols, and then talked it over with my primary care doctor before starting anything. I looked into tirzepatide too but we chose semaglutide because of the dosing and the safety profile for me.

My protocol was slow and steady, here is roughly how the dosing went. I started 0.25 mg weekly for the first month to get used to it. I moved to 0.5 mg after month one, 1.0 mg at month three, 1.7 mg at month four, and 2.4 mg by month six. After month ten my doctor and I dropped to 1.7 mg to manage ongoing nausea and to see if I could hold weight without the highest dose. Everyone will be different, so treat these numbers as an example not a prescription.

The first six weeks were the hardest. Nausea was real, coffee smelled like a punch in the face, and eating out felt pointless because everything tasted bland. I learned to eat small servings of protein first, sip water constantly, and keep plain crackers in my car. Those simple things made the side effects tolerable. I lost 25 lbs in the first three months and felt ecstatic, but then months four to seven were a plateau. I actually gained 5 lbs back after a couple of vacations and stopping tracking food. I felt embarrassed and almost quit the medication because I thought it was not working for me anymore.

What pulled me out of the stall was not a bigger dose. It was adding two strength training sessions a week and logging protein at each meal. I also started meeting with a dietitian for a few sessions to rebuild habits that fit my life. The weight started moving again, slower but steady. I lost 35 more pounds over the next seven months.

A1c went from 6.1 at baseline to 5.4. Blood pressure came down from around 142 over 90 to 122 over 76. My LDL dropped from 140 to 112 and triglycerides improved. Those numbers mattered more than the scale for my doc and for me. I had more energy for walking the dog, my sleep improved, and I stopped needing acid reflux meds. Clothes are noticeably smaller, I went from size 40 jeans to a comfortable 34, and casual confidence at work improved in a quiet way.

There were emotional swings. At the start I felt hopeful but anxious about long term maintenance. The stall made me feel ashamed and like I had failed. Getting back on track taught me something important. This is not a single tool that fixes everything. It is a medicine that makes behavior change easier, and you still have to do the work. When I slipped up I tried to be curious about why, not cruel to myself.

Practical notes that helped me. Schedule injections on the same weekday so it becomes routine. Keep bland snacks and electrolytes handy for the nausea window. If you get persistent GI problems talk to your provider about a temporary dose change. Track strength training progress because the scale can be stubborn while you gain muscle. And get labs checked periodically so you can see the objective wins like A1c and lipids.

If you are on the fence, talk to your doctor, set realistic expectations, and plan for bumps. This was not magic. It is the best tool I have used in years, paired with small consistent changes. If I can do this while running a full time job and parenting two kids, you can probably find a path that works for you.

1r2oy2g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2oy2g,"I worked on testing standing desks at Vernal, AMA on how desk performance and stability claims are actually evaluated.","I’ve spent the past several months working closely on testing and validation of a new standing desk at Vernal called Core3 (cycle testing, load and lifting capacity testing, stability at height, anti-collision behavior). Based on this testing, we documented the results in a detailed test report to capture how the desk performed under defined conditions and where limitations were observed.

Many standing desk issues don’t show up on day one. They tend to appear after repeated lift cycles, at full standing height, with rated and defined loads applied. This kind of testing helps answer long-term questions users often have, such as how a desk behaves after repeated adjustments, sustained loading, and extended use, which short demos and early reviews usually can’t address.

When researching standing desks, it’s easy to come across claims like “stable,” “heavy-duty,” “safe,” or “built to last.” What’s often missing is clarity about what testing sits behind those claims, how those tests are performed, and what assumptions they’re based on. That’s what this testing work was meant to document. The goal of this testing was to systematically evaluate performance, durability, and safety behavior under defined conditions, and to document both expected results and non-ideal outcomes.

Through repeated testing, I looked at desk behavior as part of the testing team, under applied loads up to the rated 160 kg (353 lbs), across many lift cycles, at full standing height, and during edge cases that don’t show up in short demos or early reviews.

This AMA isn’t about comparing brands or promoting products. It’s about sharing how standing desk claims are formed, what kinds of tests are typically used to support them, and how understanding the testing process can help you better evaluate those claims beyond reviews or surface-level specs.

I can speak to testing approaches, what was measured, and what we learned from the process. I won’t be discussing pricing, discounts, or competitor comparisons here.

If you’ve ever wondered what a desk claim actually means in practice or how it would be tested, feel free to ask. I’ll answer from the testing and validation perspective.

I’m happy to answer questions around things like:

* Performance and stability evaluation at full standing height
* Load and lifting capacity testing under rated weight and defined test conditions
* Limitations and non-ideal outcomes observed during testing
* What do test results actually mean in daily use?

If you already use a standing desk, are thinking about getting one, or are just curious about what happens behind the scenes, feel free to ask anything. I’ll answer from the testing and product side as openly as I can. For anyone who prefers to look at the details first, the full test report has been shared publicly and is available for reference.

Hello everyone,

I’m 19 years old, 6’1 and weigh 80 kg. I consider myself “skinny fat” — but not completely out of shape. I’ve been doing push-ups since my early teens, so I have broad shoulders and a decent base. However, I still have a slightly chubby chest, which makes me feel like I fall into the skinny fat category.

I’ve been going to the gym for 2 months now and I’m seeing some beginner gains. I just want to know if I’m doing things right.

*(Also, I used ChatGPT to help me structure this post because English is not my first language. I hope that’s okay.)*



**My Target Physique (What I Actually Want)**

* I don’t want huge muscles or a bodybuilder physique
* I want to be lean and athletic
* Visible abs / good core
* Defined arms
* Look good in fitted t-shirts / collar t-shirts
* Something like “one-fourth David Laid” — aesthetic but not massive
* Strong, fit, and healthy long term

Basically: lean, sharp, and athletic — not bulky.



**My Current Workout Split**

* Monday – Back & Biceps
* Tuesday – Chest & Triceps
* Wednesday – Shoulders + 5km run
* Thursday – Back & Biceps
* Friday – Chest & Triceps
* Saturday – Shoulders & Legs
* Daily – 1km treadmill (incline 2)



**Back Exercises**

* Lat pulldown
* Seated cable row
* Machine pull-ups
* Barbell/dumbbell row (lying down pulling towards chest for thickness)



**Biceps Exercises**

* Standing curls
* Seated curls
* Preacher curls
* Cable curls
* Hammer curls



**Chest Exercises**

* Incline bench press
* Flat bench press
* Machine chest press
* Incline machine press
* Chest fly



**Triceps Exercises**

* Tricep pushdown (overhand grip)
* Reverse grip pushdown
* Rope overhead extensions



**Shoulder Exercises**

* Shoulder press
* Shrugs
* Lateral raises
* Front raises
* Face pulls (rope towards mouth for rear delts — I feel a strong burn here)



**Leg Exercises**

* Hamstring curls
* Quad extensions
* Leg press
* Calf raises



**Cardio**

* 1 km treadmill daily
* 5 km run on Wednesdays
* I actually enjoy cardio

My fear: I’ve heard cardio makes you lose muscle. Is that true? I don’t want to lose the little muscle I’ve built.



**My Diet**

* Morning: 5 whole boiled eggs + 4 chapatis
* Afternoon: Coffee (4 sachets) with 250 ml milk
* Snack: Rice cake + peanut butter
* Evening: 100g paneer + 4 chapatis
* Before bed: High protein oats + peanut butter

No supplements currently.



**My Questions**

1. Am I training correctly for a lean aesthetic physique?
2. Is my split good or too much?
3. Is cardio going to kill my gains?
4. Should I cut first or maintain?
5. Is my diet okay for staying lean and building some muscle?

I don’t want to get huge. I just want to look fit, lean, and confident.

Thank you for reading this. I really appreciate any advice 🙏

1r2ox2e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2ox2e,Tired of trying my best to be feminine and failing miserably. (Vent + TW for ED).,"Hi, r/FTMfemininity; FtM binary dude here, 18 years old.

Couldn't think of a more appropriate community to post that other than here. You've been very welcoming and nice when I first posted here some months ago, and I'll be forever grateful for that.

Well, I'm tired of trying my best to be feminine, but still being too masculine. Testosterone gave me some changes that, personally, I don't vibe with as much as other transmasculine people would — Large back and shoulders, body hair, facial hair, nose growth, the acne, muscles, etc. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly grateful I am on testosterone for 2 years and 4 months now (Starting when I turned 16), testosterone saver my life and I do am euphoric over those changes, however, I may be turning too masculine for my taste. Ever since I know myself as a person, my goal was to be a twink. An emo little twink that looks cool, masculine but frail and delicate at the same time, with lean features... You all know the drill. And, I might not be able to achieve that even because of genetics.

I'm all large, my ribcage is massive, aswell as my hips. I have thick thighs and a fair amount of muscle, along with thick fingers (A twink called them fat today 😒, forever jealous of him), a deep voice, a big ass square face that looks like Minecraft Steve from afar. I had always been the large type, bigger than everyone else my age, both in genetics and in fat/weight. I grew up obese. 

Ever since I started Testosterone, I lost about twenty kilos (44 lbs), when I started at eighty two kilos (180 lbs). I'm 1,62 meters tall, 5'2~ish. So, I indeed am in my healthy weight at this point, but I can't help but see Nikocado Avocado in the mirror. Well, I've been in a caloric deficit for about a year now, and quite frankly, my weight loss got way quicker. I purposefully skip breakfast by either sleeping till noon (In an intermittent fasting) or chugging lots of water. I'm Brazilian, so lunch generally consists in homemade rice, beans and protein like ground beef or chicken, and I definitely don't eat the biggest plate. At dinner, I always have a cup of coffee with milk – religiously, and some kind of carb like a sandwich, we never really have ""true food"" at dinner, it's like the american lunch. So, intuitively (Because if I did count calories I would turn insane – Trust me, I already tried), my daily intake is from about 900 ~ 1200 calories. 

Now, I see so much pretty people in here, with the perfect lean, more said so feminine bodies, snatched waists and that's also on instagram and any other socials. All beautiful, flawless transmasculine boys that I'd genuinely do anything to turn into. And I'm becoming so afraid of both staying on Testosterone or stopping it because, for the first one – I'm worried if testosterone will turn me even more masculine and get me way more farther away from my goal of becoming a self made twink, and in the second – I'm *terrified* of gaining back the weight I lost on testosterone, of my face and limbs becoming even rounder, and all the bad parts of having a working uterus aswell. 

I don't know what to do, I don't want to accept myself, I should be able to reach my childhood dreams just like everyone else. I can work my way up there, but this is so exhausting. I've always been a femboy in soul, why can't I get there now that I've got my hands on testosterone, already? I'm tired of looking borderline decent sideways and then like a double fridge facing forward. I'm tired of not being small and delicate, of being treated as a ""Big brother"" or the ""Masculine figure"" by younger ftms that are just like I wish I were, and speaking of them, I even left the Ballroom Scene from my city because I couldn't stand being around to skinny, feminine people celebrating their bodies. 

This is all just a very untasteful joke for both me and you, reader. I'm on therapy, but I started pretty soon, and I wonder if it will be able to help me because of my always worsening mindset. I wish I could be normal about this, to be euphoric and celebrate my now masculine body. To be confident enough to appear in pictures, to smile, to reveal my body more, to not be afraid if the shirts I'm wearing are showing my belly rolls, to not be so annoyed when the sleeves roll up a little bit and reveal my ""winged"" arms. To not have to fill my face of make-up and smoothening filters because of the acne I've had *since age NINE*...

Anyway, I will be leaving some of my pictures here, both looking ""natural"" at home and dressed up for going out. I do apologize for the instagram screenshots because, unfortunately, I don't really keep photos of myself in my gallery because if I did, I would find imperfections that are not there for other people. I do appreciate advice and any comment, whether relating to me or speaking from a contrary standpoint. Just don't be an asshole. I will probably delete this post soon, anyway.

I also apologize in advance if this post is too sensitive for this community, and will understand completely if the mods delete this. I just needed to get this off my chest.

TL;DR: Testosterone is turning me too masc and I'm afraid of both continuing and leaving it because I might turn even more mask or gain all the weight I lost when starting testosterone. I am also tired of doing my best to look feminine but not being able to pull it off because of genetics + testosterone + ED mindset.

1r2ot1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1r2ot1t/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2_all/,"Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, All Background / Roleplay Choices, with Full Dialogue","While Bloodlines 2 is a bit light in terms of roleplay, there are a few times early in the game where you get to define part of your Phyre's backstory, and the game does acknowledge those choices in dialogue and codex entries. If you, like me, want to know more about your character before you start playing, here are all of the times in the early game that you get to make those decisions, the options you're presented with, and the full dialogue that results from those options.

**Background (after becoming a vampire)**

At the start of *In Chains of Lead and Gold*, Fabien will say, *""Some have you as a destroyer, others an omen of doom. But er… what would you say?""*

**> I am a traveler.**

* *Phyre: I have journeyed across centuries and continents. I am a traveler.*
* *Fabien: The stories sure do have you on the move.*
* *Phyre: Stagnation is corruption.*
* *Fabien: Amen. If you don’t mind me asking, was there anywhere, anywhen, that just clicked for you?*
   * **> Buying dreams in Constantinople.**
      * *Phyre: Constantinople. Four hundred years ago. My mortal home. My home afterward, too, for a time. My favorite place was the Grand Bazaar. The colors, the vitality. Air heavy with perfume and spice from lands that I then only dreamed of.*
      * *Fabien: I’m no wanderer, but the world’s a lot smaller now than it was. Getting smaller, too. How big it must have been, back then…*
      * *Phyre: Not big enough.*
   * **> The Masquerades of Venice.**
      * *Phyre: I used to roam the calli of Venice, La Serenissima, late at night. We all wore masks then everything was an intrigue, a romance. We played such beautiful, deadly games.*
      * *Fabien: Sounds a little too sophisticated for me, and a little too stabby. I favor a simple city of thugs and coffee.*
      * *Phyre: It was amusing. Until it wasn’t. But there we are.*
   * **>The libraries of Prague.**
      * *Phyre: I remember Prague, with its hundred spires. And its libraries. Places of terror and delight. I read ancient books that were printed when I was young. And I read many secrets. Invaluable and unutterable.*
      * *Fabien: A reader, huh? I like a good mystery myself. Tangled webs that work to a simple solution. What real life should be like but so rarely is.*
      * *Phyre: Ah. Fiction. Most of the two thousand books I read claimed to be fact. Very few told the truth.*

**> I am a warrior.**

* *Phyre: I am a warrior.*
* *Fabien: Well, your reputation holds up. My own philosophy is: when they throw a punch, be somewhere else. Preferably a different city. But while we’re killing time, did you have a favorite time killing?*
   * **> Spoiling Napoleon’s ambitions.**
      * *Phyre: I aided Cadiz, when Napoleon invaded after his exile. It was the only city that never fell to him. I spoiled the ambition of a tyrant and… others.*
      * *Fabien: Huh. So why stand up to him, then? Political ideals? Or did he just look at you funny?*
      * *Phyre: No mortal has the right to be monarch.*
   * **> Bringing terror to the ocean.**
      * *Phyre: Three hundred years ago, I had a ship and a crew. We wrought such beautiful horrors. Merchant ships, naval vessels, and others. We did not discriminate. We would board. Stain white sails red. Turn entrails to rigging. How free we were, then.*
   * **> Defending my homeland.**
      * *Phyre: The Russian Tsar waged war on my homeland, hundreds of years after I left. The Crimean War. I had long kept out of the country’s struggles. But not this time. We were not unsuccessful against the Tsar and… others.*

**> I am a survivor.**

* *Phyre: Where I travel, disaster follows. When I war, it is against misfortune. If I am anything, I am a survivor.*
* *Fabien: Oh. That’s not what I expected to hear. But if that’s the truth, that’s the truth. And I’m rather fond of surviving, myself. Well then. What’s the most dangerous thing out there, in your experience?*
   * **> Mortals that hate.**
      * *Phyre: I saw the Witch Trials as they played out across Europe. They slew many of our kind - I barely escaped. But in fear and hate, they also slaughtered the ones they loved. Mortal hate is the danger. And there are forces who harness it. If they could burn the whole world, they would.*
      * *Fabien: Bad news. In 1945 they figured out how to, uh… Never mind. Good news: Despite it all, we’re still here.*
   * **> Ideals that demand blood.**
      * *Phyre: I was in France during the Reign of Terror. At first, I admired their work. They killed every enemy of the people. And then, they did something remarkable: They made more enemies of the people. And more. Ideals that demand blood are never satiated. They are the danger. Many I knew died their final deaths. I nearly died mine.*
      * *Fabien: Were you on the original list? Or the expanded edition?*
      * *Phyre: I am on the list of those who survived, and that is all that matters.*
   * **> The fight for power.**
      * *Phyre: I have escaped wars over the mortal crowns of Spain, England, Poland, Austria. So too have I escaped purges, plots, and persecutions in the Courts of our kind. Whether mortal or not, it is the same. When it is uncertain who holds power, knives come out.*
      * *Fabien: Interesting times, for certain… have you ever lived in an uninteresting time?*
      * *Phyre: No. There are always those who sow confusion and sharpen knives. We do what we must.*
      * *Fabien: Well, Seattle has both confusion and knives aplenty. But you weren’t just running - you helped out, right?*

**Background (before becoming a vampire)**

At the end of *The Dutiful Beloved*, during *Keep the Peace*, you can offer to cheer up Safia by telling her something about yourself that she wouldn't find in a history book, and she asks, *""Before there was the Nomad, who were you?""* Depending on your clan, you get three options.

* **Banu Haqim**
   * **> I was a soldier, a Janissary.**
      * *Phyre: I was a Janissary in the Sultan’s house guard.*
      * *Safia: A Janissary? Then you were one of the devshirme! The blood tax!*
      * *Phyre: Taken from my family, converted, and brought to Constantinople, yes. I began as a levy and rose to the elite infantry.*
   * **> I was a law-abiding noble.**
      * *Phyre: I was a noble, raised to be obedient, to know the scriptures and my place in the empire.*
   * **> I was an assassin.**
      * *Phyre: My clan’s reputation is, in this instance, accurate. I was an assassin.*
* **Brujah**
   * **> I rebelled against my noble family.**
      * *Phyre: I was the wayward child of a noble, flinging aside the silver platter, spitting out the silver spoon.*
   * **> I was part of a political uprising.**
      * *Phyre: I fought in Anatolia against the Ottoman regime.*
   * **> I was a common bandit.**
      * *Phyre: No more than a common bandit, relieving traveling nobles of their burdens on the road into Constantinople.*
* **Lasombra**
   * **> I was Grand Vizier.**
      * *Phyre: I was Grand Vizier. The Sultan’s most-trusted political advisor.*
      * *Safia: A Vizier? Then you were one of the devshirme! The blood tax!*
      * *Phyre: Indeed. Taken from my family, converted and brought to Constantinople, to the harem, where I rose through the ranks.*
   * **> I made myself a noble.**
      * *Phyre: I had become nobility, though not by birth. I learnt what it took to be powerful - and to stay that way.*
   * **> I was a notorious criminal.**
      * *Phyre: I earned something of a reputation in the underbelly of Constantinople. For that, I was feared, respected and ultimately obeyed.*
* **Toreador**
   * **> I was born in luxury.**
      * *Phyre: I was born of noble blood. And was indulged in all the vices and luxuries, which let me sample the delights of the world.*
   * **> I was a rebellious artist.**
      * *Phyre: I grew up among artists and free-thinkers and used my art to challenge and inspire. The Sultan branded me a rebel.*
   * **> I was a poet and a thief.**
      * *Phyre: I used my words to steal both hearts and treasures. Needless to say their owners were displeased, and I changed my name and my home more than once.*
* **Tremere**
   * **> I was the Sultan’s Astrologer.**
      * *Phyre: I was Court Astrologer. The Sultan would wish to know how many pups his bitch would bear by the alignment of the planets. If I answered five and she birthed three, I would be out of a job - and a head. Luckily, I was good at it.*
   * **> I was a noble prodigy.**
      * *Phyre: I was the child prodigy of a respected scholar. Our library rivalled that even of the Topkapi Palace.*
   * **> I was a charlatan.**
      * *Phyre: I was, in all truth, a charlatan. I spoke big words, mixed dubious remedies, foretold fictitious fortunes… and was paid all too well for the pleasure.*
* **Venture**
   * **> I was an old-money noble.**
      * *Phyre: I was born to a long line of nobility. A silver platter before me, a silver spoon in my mouth - as was my birthright.*
   * **> I was a political hostage.**
      * *Phyre: I was, in fact, royalty. The wrong kind of royalty. My blood was considered a threat to the Sultan’s claim. My early life I spent imprisoned in the Kafes. I was lucky not to be executed. But time had… other plans.*
   * **> I was a traitor to the crown.**
      * *Phyre: You would find me in your books by a different name. I was convicted of treason and would have been executed. But time had… other plans.*

**Sire**

Also during *The Dutiful Beloved*, as a follow-up to the previous question, Safia also asks, *""Your Sire \[…\] Would I know them?""* While you can't name a specific person, you can hint at their identify by saying:

* **> Probably, yes.**
   * *Phyre: If I spoke the name, yes, I do believe you would know it.*
* **> Probably not.**
   * *Phyre: They were ultimately a nobody, so I very much doubt it.*
* **> They are long gone now.**
   * *Phyre: They rest now. That is all you need know.*

**Notes and Other Thoughts**

For the most part, in-game dialogue will only acknowledge your clan; however, the obvious place that an npc, other than Fabien, has different voice lines depending on your background choice is when talking to Lou Graham at the end of *In Chains of Lead and Gold*. I won't list all of them and am not sure what she says if you choice not to elaborate on your background, meaning that there could possibly be up to 12 different lines, but a few of my examples include: if you chose Traveler, Prague, she quips that the public library probably doesn't have anything that would interest you; if you chose Warrior, Pirate, she will comment that swashbuckling has gone out of style; and if you chose Survivor, Hate, she puts on a French ascent and talks about Madame Guillotine.

During your first encounter with Ysabella at the end of *In Chains of Lead and Gold*, she has some clan related dialogue before you get any options, but if you say that you have an appreciation for art and artists as a Lasombra, she'll speculate that you like Goya. This made me wonder if she has different painter suggestions for each clan, but when I took that option as a Tremere, she said that art is arcane after all. Needless to say, I was a touch disappointed.

The only other place that I have hard evidence that the game acknowledges your background choices is in the various codex entries about the Nomad specifically. For example, in Notes - The Nomad of Constantinople, found by Fabien at Wake the Dead and added to your codex after waking up, if you are a Warrior, Defender, it tells the story of you making the decisive difference during the Seven Year's War, while not knowing which side you fought for; whereas, if you are a Traveler, Prague, it tells the story of you gaining entry into the Vatican archives to conduct unknown research.",10,1770887660.0,vtmb,4,1.0,False

1r2os1f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2os1f,2 weeks post Flight,"I made a post some time ago about traveling from Brazil to New Zealand. The LATAM plane crossed the pacific ocean in one of the most isolated regions in the world.

The flight although very exhausting was also very calm.

So here is some of the photos to show how worth it was to travel by plane. I was pretty scared and full of adrenaline the whole trip believing my time would come and the plane would crash.

It didn’t happen.

Instead i’m living a paradise dream that i couldn’t even possible believe it would happen in my life.

I was pretty sad the months and weeks before traveling thinking it wouldn’t happen or the plane would crash, i even stopped eating one week prior to the flight.

So i wouldn’t really like flying again but without airplanes i wouldn’t be able to live through this new reality.

So if you are afraid but you think the travel would change your life it may really be worth to eat your fears and just take the plane in hopes of a better life.

During the plane i also prayed a lot to Jesus Christ, and as i promised, that if i got in New Zealand i would go to his church and pray in gratitude to his protection, and as you guys can see in one of the photos so i did when i arrived.

During that time, milk was expensive and difficult to obtain, so a bartender named Nguyễn Văn Giảng who worked at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel experimented with whisked egg yolks and sugar as a substitute for milk. The mixture created a thick, creamy foam that sat on top of strong Vietnamese coffee. The result wasn’t just a replacement it became something entirely unique. The drink has a custard-like texture, almost like liquid tiramisu, balancing the bitterness of robusta coffee with a sweet, velvety topping. What began as a creative response to wartime shortages eventually turned into one of Hanoi’s most iconic drinks.

I have been digging through blogs and reddit posts on how to go about this trip but it leaves me with some questions.

My partner and I are very keen on hiking (multiple day hikes included), tea and coffee culture and good food. While we plan to visit cities such as Taipei and Tainan we would also like to explore the lesser travelled parts of Taiwan - the Taitung-, Hualien-, Nantou-, and Chiayi County.

It seems I can find little on these counties apart from the bigger attractions (Taitung City, Alishan, etc.) We are looking to explore these counties and focus on the outdoors and unique experiences (tea farms, tea tastings, etc.). We will be able to rent either scooters or a car, both is fine and I feel more than comfortable driving around in a car.

So my question would be: where can I find more information about these counties and what unique hikes/experiences I can find there?

1r2ogqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1r2ogqx/got_medicated_for_adhd_with_no_testing_by_a_pa_my/,"Got medicated for ADHD with no testing by a PA, my therapist says they shouldn't have done that","Hi there. So I'm 30, suspected I might have ADHD for a while now.

Asked my PCP years ago, told her about my anxiety and possible ADHD. She asked a few questions and diagnosed me with GAD and prescribed SSRIs. I asked about ADHD/Autism and she gave me a list of places I could go to get tested in the area.

I didn't follow up on this for a year or so, maybe I was scared, maybe because I know the diagnosis process can be very expensive.

A few months ago I went to an office. I didn't go by her list, instead I googled psychiatrists and went to one. I talked with someone at the psychiatrist's office, his card says he's a PA. He is young and very casual and used profanity while talking to me. More like a friend than a doctor. I thought he was chill at first but now it just makes me uncomfortable and seems unprofessional.

I explained to him why I think I might have ADHD. My father and my sister are both diagnosed, I have issues with memory, attention, impulse control, interrupting ""See, I'm doing it right now!"" I said. This has been my entire life and I've functioned well enough to be successful but I am under constant stress and burnout.

He gave me 2 options. Option 1: I could go to a neurologist and spend 10 hours (and a lot of money) doing tests and filling out assessments, for them to send me back with a ""maybe"", at which point we would try medication.

Option 2: He agrees with me that ""maybe"" I have ADHD, which the next step would be to try medication and see what works for me.

I chose option 2 because he said it would save me time and money and who doesn't want that, right? He wrote me a prescription for Adderall that day, and based the dose on how many cups of coffee I said I normally have a day (5).

The medication has worked wonders and I have found myself being a lot more productive. But I still can't shake the feeling that we skipped over a lot. I don't even know if I can be said to be officially diagnosed. How can you diagnose with no tests?

So the other day I saw my therapist who I had last seen before all this medication, and I told her the story. She was shocked. She showed me a list of all the assessments that she is required to go through with clients before they can 

even be medicated. But she is a therapist not a psychiatrist so I don't know. She works for the counselling services at my school. They might have different rules. But she looked very concerned that they prescribed with no testing. She said it could even be considered malpractice. I told her I did have a weird feeling about the situation and I wondered if they were just trying to push pills on people. 

I was wondering myself, especially with how sought after Adderall is and how many people at school use and even abuse it. 

But I'm also wondering if my therapist was overreacting, and if the psychiatrist office can really do whatever they want when it comes to writing prescriptions without testing.

My question to reddit, is this normal, and would you recommend I go and get evaluated anyway? I'm leaning towards yes, so that I can be confident in my diagnosis. But I'm also leaning no, because it will be expensive, and I already have medication and know it's helping anyway.

She would call the girl too and that’s how I knew she had arrived. I believe the background was pink of the building and the door was an opaque grey. I also remember the character had emotions like nervous faces and frantic too. 

It also had a simple plant in the room and it was all **2D**. There were **sound effects** too like whooshing and dings/ring tones. I feel like I remember there being a book too where it had tasks I needed to complete. I feel like it’s a very niche game and it probably doesn’t exist anymore.

1r2od5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GLP1Guide/comments/1r2od5x/from_228_to_204_in_12_weeks_on_semaglutide_here/,"From 228 to 204 in 12 weeks on semaglutide, here is what actually changed for me","I started semaglutide at 228 lbs about three months ago. I am 12 weeks in and currently 204 lbs. I wanted to write a straight up account of what I felt, what I did about side effects, and the small practical things that actually helped me keep going instead of quitting at week 2 when the nausea hit.



My dosing schedule was the typical slow ramp. 0.25 mg weekly for the first four weeks, 0.5 mg for weeks 5 to 8, then 1 mg for weeks 9 to 12. My provider told me we could go higher after 12 weeks if needed. I injected in the thigh most of the time, rotating sites each week and letting the pen warm up a few minutes on the counter before injecting. Little things like that made the injections feel less weird.



Week 1 was rough, I had low level nausea and a weird aversion to coffee. I managed that by eating very small protein snacks every couple of hours, sipping ginger tea, and keeping crackers by the bed the first few mornings. By week 3 the nausea eased a lot. Week 4 my appetite dropped noticeably. I stopped obsessing about constant snacking and started actually planning two decent meals and a protein snack. Weight came off faster once I stopped grazing.



I did hit constipation at week 6. That was the worst for me in terms of day to day discomfort. What helped was increasing water, adding a tablespoon of psyllium in the morning, and making sure I got at least 20 grams of fiber spread through the day plus a short walk after meals. I ran that past my provider first because everyone reacts differently. Simple over the counter options helped a couple of times when it was bad, but hydration and fiber were the long term fix.



Headaches were occasional in weeks 2 to 5, likely from changes in eating. Coffee in the morning and a magnesium supplement at night reduced how often they hit. I also paid attention to electrolytes since I was eating less and sweating during walks.



On the lifestyle side I kept it simple. I did thirty minutes of walking five times a week and added one strength session a week. I focused meals around protein and veg, but I did not go crazy counting every calorie. I weighed myself once a week and took photos every two weeks. Seeing the progress on the scale and in photos helped me stick with it when motivation dipped.



Cost and provider access can be a hurdle. I did a lot of research before starting and found a telehealth option that helped me get a prescription and set up follow ups. I found them after searching around and used [https://www.semaglu.com](https://www.semaglu.com) for info and to connect with a provider who walked me through titration and side effect management.



Emotionally it has been a weird mix. I felt frustrated in the first month because food felt different and eating habits kept changing. By month three I felt more confident, clothes fit better, and the smaller wins kept me going. I still have days where progress plateaus for a week or two and that is okay. I check labs periodically with my PCP and keep my provider in the loop about any new symptoms.



If you are thinking about starting, consider a slow titration, plan for simple nausea fixes, prioritize fiber and hydration, and set realistic activity goals you can actually keep. For folks who are already on semaglutide, how long did the constipation or nausea last for you and what actually helped? I would love to hear practical tips that worked for others.",1,1770885972.0,GLP1Guide,0,1.0,False

I started semaglutide at 0.25 mg weekly because that is what my clinic recommended, stayed there for 4 weeks, bumped to 0.5 mg for 8 weeks, and then moved to 1.0 mg at week 13. I went from 210 to 192 pounds in the first 12 weeks so that gives you an idea of appetite change and how it felt in real life. A buddy of mine is on tirzepatide and had similar stuff but a bit more intense nausea early on. I am not a doctor, this is what worked for me and what I observed from others in the group clinic visits and online forums I trust. If something is severe check with your provider right away. Also I found a good side effects guide at [https://www.semaglu.com](https://www.semaglu.com) that matched a lot of what I experienced and offered extra tips. I am just sharing practical stuff that helped me cope and get past the rough weeks.



The common side effects I saw were nausea, general fatigue, constipation, occasional reflux, and a metallic taste in my mouth. Nausea was the first to hit and the one people talk about most. Fatigue showed up in week one and made workouts feel heavy. Constipation crept in after appetite and total food volume dropped. The reflux and taste issues were mild for me but annoying.



What actually helped me. For nausea small frequent bland snacks worked way better than forcing big meals. Soda crackers, plain rice, applesauce, and clear broth got me through mornings when things felt off. Ginger tea and ginger chews were surprisingly effective for the queasy days. I kept my injections to the evening after I realized that the worst nausea tended to be the day or two after the shot. Sleeping through that peak made a big difference. I also sipped electrolyte water and avoided big cups of coffee on an empty stomach because that made the nausea worse.



For constipation I increased my water to at least 2.5 liters a day, added psyllium husk once daily, and drank a small glass of prune juice at night when things got slow. Walking for 20 to 30 minutes after meals helped encourage movement. An occasional over the counter magnesium supplement before bed was useful for the first few weeks until my fiber and fluid routine was consistent. I avoided too many dairy heavy meals early on because that seemed to slow things down even more for me.



Fatigue faded the fastest once I adapted my routine. I cut my workouts back to shorter sessions for two weeks, focused on walking and mobility, and made sure to get to bed earlier. By week three my energy was mostly back and I could ramp workouts up slowly. If you feel dizzy or lightheaded talk to your provider about checking blood pressure and medications that might be interacting.



Foods that helped versus foods that made things worse were pretty clear. Helped: plain chicken, white rice, boiled potatoes, applesauce, bananas, bone broth, yogurt if tolerated, protein smoothies with a banana and a little peanut butter when solid food was unappealing. Ginger tea and peppermint tea were lifesavers for nausea. Made things worse: greasy fried food, very spicy dishes, large fatty meals, alcohol on empty stomach, and a lot of carbonated drinks. Also super sweet treats sometimes triggered more nausea for me, so I avoided crashing into high sugar meals when appetite was limited.



Timeline for improvement. Nausea was worst in weeks 1 to 3 during each dosage level and improved a lot by week 4 at a stable dose. Fatigue lasted about 1 to 3 weeks and then eased as I adjusted sleep and exercise. Constipation took longer to settle and needed consistent fiber and fluids for about 4 weeks before it felt normal again. By week 8 to 12 most of the day to day side effects were mild and manageable for me, though others I know had different timelines especially with higher doses or with tirzepatide.



If you are titrating your dose, go slow if possible. For me the easiest wins were changing injection timing to evening, eating bland foods when nauseous, small frequent meals, prioritizing hydration and fiber, and giving my workouts a temporary rest. Keep a simple log of when symptoms hit after a shot, what you ate, and how long it lasted. That helped me spot patterns fast.



I know it can feel rough at first. For most people the worst stuff fades as your body adjusts. If anything is severe or lasts unusually long please contact your provider.

I switched to tirzepatide briefly at 2.5 mg for a month to try it out and noticed a bit more appetite suppression but also a bit more nausea at first. Here are the specific things that helped me the most, hopefully they save you days of guessing.



If nausea hits, handle it like you would a stomach bug. Small bland meals work better than skipping food. I kept plain crackers, ginger tea, and a 10 ounce protein shake on hand. Eating 10 to 15 grams of protein within 30 minutes of feeling light headed stabilizes things fast. For me injecting in the evening meant I slept through the worst of the first night nausea, try that before quitting a dose.



Injection technique matters. Keep the pen at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes before you inject, it stings less. Rotate sites between abdomen, outer thigh, and upper arm each week. Pinch a small fold of skin if you are thin, insert at 90 degrees, press the dose button and hold for 5 to 10 seconds after the dose clicks so the full amount delivers. I mark the site on a little calendar so I do not repeat the same spot too often.



Diet tweaks that actually stick. Focus on protein first at every meal, aim for 25 to 35 grams per meal depending on your size, and fill the rest with high volume low calorie veg like leafy greens, zucchini, and mushrooms. Cut back on liquid calories and sweet coffee drinks which hide calories and spike nausea. If you feel completely full but low energy, a 15 gram protein snack works better than a pastry.



Hydration and electrolytes are underrated. I aim for 2 to 3 liters of water most days. If you get headaches or constipation add an electrolyte tablet in the morning or drink 12 ounces of coconut water after a heavy sweat. Constipation got better when I added 20 to 30 grams of extra fiber slowly and a daily tablespoon of psyllium at night.



Timing and consistency for weekly doses. Pick one day of the week and one time so you rarely miss a dose. I picked Sunday evening because my schedule is relaxed then. If you travel across time zones keep the same local day to avoid confusing injections. If you are more than 5 days late call your prescriber instead of guessing what to do next.



Exercise and muscle retention. GLP 1s make it easy to lose weight and appetite but you can lose muscle too if you are not careful. Two resistance sessions per week of 30 to 40 minutes plus 20 to 30 minutes of walking most days kept my energy and helped the scale reflect fat loss not muscle loss. After workouts I eat 20 to 30 grams of protein within 60 minutes to help recovery.



For dosing schedules and common escalation steps I found a decent breakdown at [https://www.semaglu.com](https://www.semaglu.com) It is not a substitute for your prescriber but it helped me know what to ask my doctor when my dose changed.



Last few quick practicals, take your medication list with you to appointments because GLP 1s can interact with some diabetes drugs, be ready to adjust insulin or sulfonylureas if you are on them. If you suddenly have severe stomach pain or prolonged vomiting get medical attention right away. Other than that, be patient with the titration, small adjustments early on made the whole thing manageable for me. If you have specific side effects tell your prescriber, they can usually tweak timing or dose so you can keep going.",1,1770885525.0,GLP1Guide,0,1.0,False
