Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

A few years ago, I developed panic disorder from a sliiight mental break from PTSD. I cut all caffeine as it seemed to trigger anxiety which would then trigger a panic attack. I also cut out nicotine and alcohol completely. Before this, I was an avid drinker, heavy nicotine user, and started every day with a 12 or 16oz redbull. it was a tough change, but i got used to it. I also went on lexapro for 6 months and did great, eventually coming off of it and have been great since mid 2022 with **very** few hiccups. I eventually reintroduced alcohol, but never caffeine or nicotine. i have no intention of starting nic usage again. 

my question is - has anyone ever reintroduced caffeine slowly into their daily routine without the anxiety returning? I have done a ton of mental work, and i think I am stronger and can handle it much better now. I enjoy decaf coffee from time to time, which i know contains small amounts of caf that have never affected me negatively. 

I am pregnant with twins and i just KNOW ill need a little boost to get me through the long days ahead, and i am not sure if going back on caffeine is the worst idea ever or if its been done safely before.

I never had a proper relationship with my father (43M) due to his narcissistic personality. I genuinely had enough, I'm posting this to let my feelings out because this is absurd.

# Details About My Life:

Just to give a bit of background about me: My parents got divorced when I was around 8 years old, and I stayed living with my dad while my mom moved somewhere nearby. My dad isn’t the type of guy to just move on and forget about her. He is obsessed with her, always mentioning her and trying to annoy her at every chance possible. For example, she started stopping by in front of our apartment before school to make sure we were doing fine and bring us some snacks and lunch for school, but my dad took this personally and started threatening her, saying that if she came anywhere near our house, he would call the police. She’s checking on her children and bringing them lunch before school—how is that wrong?He accuses her of teaching us bad things to do to him when we go over to her house on the weekends. Whenever we come back, he says, 'You’re acting different now; they infected you,' etc. I’ll just leave it at the stupidity here.  
(For reference, I have a 1-year-older brother (18M, John) from my mom.)

My dad would call my mom the worst kinds of names, cuss her out in front of us, absolutely trash her, and curse out her family. Saying such things and behaving like that in front of a 10-year-old is diabolical. Despite the emotional burden of him badmouthing her in front of us, he would also say that she taught us to do this and that to piss him off, etc. I still had an amazing childhood, thanks to my mom’s support; she was my go-to for everything. I would tell her about my dad’s abuse, but she would comfort me without saying a single bad word about him, even though he did. We kept living like that for a while.

Things only got worse moving forward. In 2023, we had to move to a different state due to an accident (I won’t go into details to stay anonymous). This led to me losing my home, school, social life, and friends. My best friend passed away alongside many other friends. We moved to a different state, so my life changed overnight, and I lost everything.

We flew to that state because my dad was already there on a work trip. and settled there.  
Around March, my dad decided to register me in a school in the new city, but I was mentally unstable and couldn’t bear going to another school after everything I had been through. So, I dropped out and started doing online school.

Being home all day led to more clashes with my dad, and his abuse escalated. I thought he would stop after everything that we went through but he was already back to his toxic crap. One day, my dad called me, but I didn’t come immediately because I had just gotten the news that my best friend had passed away. I was just sitting in my bed mindlessly in denial; my 15-year-old brain couldn’t process any of the stuff that happened because it felt unreal.

So my brother asked him to let me be, telling him that I just received this unfortunate news. My dad said, ""No, screw him and his friends—let him come here now."" Imagine how I felt after hearing him insult my dead friend like that. How cruel could he be?

Days passed, and his attitude and cursing only got worse, but we got used to ignoring it. Whenever he did something or cussed her out like that, we would just laugh and act like nothing happened—just ignore it, you know? And he would get furious because of this, saying things like, 'You truly have no dignity.' Like, what the hell do you expect me to do when my own father is cussing out my entire family in front of me for ridiculous reasons?

This was a way for my brother and me to cope because if we focused on every word he said, we would go nuts.

Let’s look at things from his perspective: He is always the victim, and I am making his life awful. I’m the one responsible for all of it, since I make him do these things. I know this sounds ridiculous, so let me explain more. Apparently, I piss him off so much that he has no choice but to cuss at me. Like, how can you not hold your tongue when talking to a 15-year-old? What justifies treating your kid this way? I honestly don’t understand how he thinks it’s okay to do all that.

For a dad who thinks everyone is trying to destroy him and that our mom is telling us to annoy him and make his life worse, I honestly think he needs help. He tried so hard to gaslight us into thinking that our mom was a horrible person and tried to get us on his side by acting like that. But too bad for him—we were smart enough to see through it and understand what kind of person my mom really is. His attempts to worsen our relationship with her only strengthened the bond between us.

This post is already getting too long, but I have to provide these details so you guys could understand the type of relationship I have with my dad.

Life kept going, and I kept ignoring him, which really had a negative backlash on my mental health, I  
  
I grew up as a chubby boy and got bullied a lot, which made me super sensitive and anxious about my looks. Therefore, I started going to the gym and working on myself, and I actually improved a lot. But guess what he had to say about this? :)

He said that this is bullshit and dieting is making me weak, and I should eat as much as I could to build muscle. He doesn't  know how a caloric deficit works, so he just kept abusing me in that regard.

Later on, I applied for an online job to have some sort of income and keep myself busy. I got accepted, and guess what he had to say about this? :)

He bought me a laptop back in 2020, but he took it and started using it himself. So he bought me another one before I got the job, and I started working using the new laptop. Things were great—until we got into a usual BS argument, and he went ahead and took the laptop from me, saying, ""This is mine—go ask your mom to buy you another one,"" two hours before my shift.

I was left devastated and had to explain to my manager why I couldn’t make it that day. Days passed, and things kept going this way—he’d take the laptop over the slightest argument and leave me in a rough spot like that. He even called my manager once and started yelling—God knows what he said. My manager is kinda related to my dad, so he has his number and gets to have these types of conversations with him.

But regardless, this is a professional environment—my manager can’t afford to lose an employee over the slightest incident with his dad. Therefore, he decided to let me go after the first month due to my dad’s madness. So I just lost a job and a way of income over his BS.

Fortunately, we worked things out later on, and I kept the job. And I kept working, avoiding arguments so he wouldn't take away the laptop. I eventually saved paycheck after paycheck until I bought my own laptop so he wouldn’t be controlling me all the time. I also bought a phone and I was getting everything I wanted without asking them for anything, which should be great—I’m now making my own money, maturing, and not putting financial pressure on him. But guess what he had to say about this? :)

He was pissed—God knows why. I guess his bossy mind didn’t approve, and he wants everyone to stay dependent on him.

For reference, my stepmom had two kids with my dad (8M and 1F). By the way, 90% of these events and the cursing happen in front of his wife and little brother, so they hear him trash me daily. This only led to me being hated and disrespected in the family.

He always tells me to go live with my mom and leave because I’m ""ruining their life,"" and all this is happening because of me—manipulating me into thinking that this is all my fault and basically guilt-tripping me, which unfortunately works thanks to my weak personality and him playing the victim card all the time.

He even asks my little brother to tell me to leave and live with my mom himself—""Tell him to go to his mom and that you hate him""—as a joke. For f\*\*\*’s sake, what type of joke is this? He’s been doing this for as long as I can remember—let’s say three years. So how can you expect a 5-year-old to not take this seriously, especially after witnessing all the stuff that’s happening in the house too?

This made my relationship with my little brother worse, which is heartbreaking because I care about him so much and want the best for him. I always look after him since his mother doesn’t care at all, They started giving him electronic devices from the age of 3 or 4, which is super bad for a child’s brain. to make things worse, she feeds him the worst kind of foods, which is making him gain a lot of weight. This is triggering to me because I went through the same thing and still struggle with weight loss to this day, so I don’t want him to go through this struggle like I did.

I tried warning my dad and saying that this is unhealthy, but guess what he had to say about this? :)

He was mad and furious, saying that ""he has his parents now, and we don’t have a say in any of this"" (me and my older brother) and that we ""shouldn’t get involved—it’s none of our business.""

So my dad created tension between us, and me looking out for him (not letting him use electronics too much) made our relationship worse. He sometimes says he hates me, which is unfortunate.

This post has gotten too long, and I don’t know if someone is willing to read something this long, but we’re already here—no point in deleting. I’ve been typing this for an hour now.

To Sum Things Up:

These are the things my dad has done to me:

\-Always badmouthing my mother and insulting her in front of me.

\-Being against everything I do (working out, dieting, etc.).

\-Ruining my chances at my online job by doing childish stuff.

\-Ruining my relationship with my little brother as a ""joke.""

\-Manipulating me and guilt-tripping me all the time.

\-Always threatening to kick me out of the house and destroy my belongings.

After knowing all these details, you know this isn’t your typical teenager fight with a parent—it’s deeper.

We can get into the problem now,  


# The Incident That Happened Today:

We are currently struggling financially. Last week, my dad asked me to get a job to help him out (my current job is part-time online and doesn’t pay much and I'm keeping that money for myself). But honestly, I don’t see myself contributing to this house with any money after all this treatment imagine paying just to get treated this poorly.

I ignored these thoughts and looked for a job in a few stores around, but no one was hiring, so he asked me to keep trying until I found one.

I woke up this morning and saw them drinking coffee and having a wafer with it. I joined them to have some myself, only to see my stepmom feeding my sister a part of the wafer. As I mentioned above, my stepmom is uneducated and irresponsible; she doesn't know that feeding a 15-month-old baby these types of foods is wrong. This is a habit of hers that I've been ignoring for a long time.

I really care about my little sister She is my everything, and I want her to grow up healthy. So I interrupted, saying that these processed snacks are super unhealthy we shouldn’t be eating them as grown-ups, let alone giving them to a 1-year-old toddler.  
  
She responded by saying that this is 'her business' and that she wants her daughter to 'eat everything like normal human beings' (implying I'm a picky eater).

So I said, ""Yeah, but that’s not how it works. You should be feeding her real food instead of processed snacks.""

My dad tried to stop me, but I didn’t stop. This was a crucial matter my little sister’s health was at stake, and I didn’t want her to get hurt because of their ignorance. I kept arguing, trying to convince her, but she didn't listen. My dad eventually said, 'Enough, shut up, or I’m gonna cuss your mother.' I would normally stop to avoid worse arguments, but this time I was so angry and said:

""Okay, go ahead, tough guy do it, cuss her. You think you’re the sht! I couldn’t give less of a f\*\*\* it’s your loss. You’re losing our respect by acting and behaving like that. *What do you think your wife feels hearing you obsess over your ex from 10 years ago? It’s pathetic.*""

He was silent, probably shocked that I stood up to him, until I asked how he’d feel if I cussed his mom like he does to mine. He raged, saying things like, 'How dare you try to insult your dad and compare yourself to me!' Then he made a scene.

He eventually stopped, grabbed both my laptop and phone, and started leaving the house. I tried to stop him, saying, 'This is my property, and I need it. you don't get to take it ' but he just told me to 'F off' and walked out.

I'm home alone, writing this on my brother's laptop, and I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I've had enough. His abuse is only going to get worse after this incident because I didn’t let it slide as usual and took it this far.

I usually talk about stuff like this with my mom, but she's on vacation, and I don't want to burden her with it. I'd appreciate a second opinion on the situation. I just want to know what you guys would do if you were in my shoes.  
  
Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.

I’ve been dealing with chronic bladder/pelvic pain since August of last year. I’ve been to countless doctors. Given 20 + urine samples, I’ve given so much blood, I’ve done ultra sounds, 7 + rounds of antibiotics, pelvic floor PT, yoga, acupuncture, chiropractors, I’ve taken dozens of supplements, I gave up coffee (but started drinking it again, because you can pry that liquid gold out of my cold, dead hands lol) I’ve missed events, I’ve lashed out at my loved ones. I’ve cried and cried and CRIED wondering “Am I f****** crazy? Is it all in my head??” I’ve spent about 5,000 dollars out of pocket only to be told, “Well you look fine, have you tried cutting out sugar?” 

I finally found a doctor who believed me, and agreed that laparoscopic surgery was the only way to get a diagnosis. 
I also did a cystoscopy, and bladder installation. 
Today endometriosis was found and removed from my bladder. 
This morning I almost canceled because I actually felt better than I had in months. 
It’s like when you take your car to the mechanic and all of the sudden the check engine light turns off. 
I was telling myself “maybe it’s really not that bad and you are being dramatic, and you are wasting everyone’s time and your money.” 
In reality, it IS that bad. 
I feel so validated. I’m so thankful to my friends, my boyfriend and my family for being there on some of my darkest days. 
I’ve made new connections and deepened old connections due to this disease. 
Being thrown into our health care system and truly seeing the ugliness of it all has been a trip. 
I lost trust in myself and I will work everyday to never do that again. 

I am feeling sore and I know it is possible for it to come back but we’re not thinking about that, right now , we are celebrating.

A few days ago, I thought I was making progress after my last post (thanks for the support on that, by the way). But then a flare-up hit me out of nowhere. I bent down to grab my coffee mug, and that sharp, burning pain shot down my leg like a lightning bolt.

I froze, heart pounding, whispering to myself, “Please, not again.” I sat on the floor, holding back tears, remembering those nights two years ago when sciatica first turned my life upside down when I couldn’t even walk my dog without wincing. It’s a cruel reminder of how unpredictable this journey is, and I know so many of you feel this too.

After the flare-up, I knew I had to try something different. I’d shared a stretch in my last post (seated forward bend with a yoga block), which helped me sit longer, but this time I wanted to explore a more holistic, natural approach. I started using turmeric tea 1 teaspoon of turmeric with a pinch of black pepper in hot water, twice a day.

It’s a natural anti-inflammatory, and after a few days, I noticed the swelling in my lower back felt less intense. I’m not saying it’s a cure, but it gave me a small win when I needed it most. Has anyone else tried something like this? I’d love to hear your thoughts on holistic approaches, what’s worked for you, or what hasn’t?

Reflecting on this flare-up, I also revisited some resources that helped me early on. Answering those questions helped me figure out what my body needed more rest, less stretching for now. It was a quick way to reassess my approach, and it gave me clarity when I felt lost. I’m curious if you’ve tried similar tools to personalize your relief, what’s been your experience?

I’d also love to hear how you handle flare-ups. What do you do when the pain comes back? And what’s your take on natural remedies like turmeric or other holistic methods? Your stories and insights mean so much we’re all in this together, and I’m rooting for us to find relief.

It was a fun time for the time being you know just dumbasses being dumbasses but one thing really caught my eye, a man not even a spooky looking one just a normal man… always observing us during our trip, just watching us but after 10 hours it basically completely worn off no more crazy visuals no more stupid shit coming out of our mouths. We didn’t feel normal but didn’t feel like we were tripping soon Daniel left, But the man didn’t…

During the next day I saw him watching me from my doorway I thought “hmmm maybe it hasn’t fully worn off yet?” So I ignored it cuz I knew he wasn’t real. Later when I got home from work he was just sitting on my couch and watching tv and I didn’t leave the T.V on I thought “no no I must’ve left it on, he’s not real he’s not fucking real” I start freaking the fuck out, my heart started to race, I started sweating, but I knew he wasn’t even there but to make sure I threw a pear at him and yes I said pear. And guess what I fucking missed but not fully it scrapped his hand but his skin didn’t move? It didn’t ripple, it didn’t stretch, and he didn’t fucking react…

I went to my bed praying to god he wouldn’t be there when I woke up but at some point during the night I woke up and saw him staring at me through the crack in my closet. For backstory I am deathly afraid of Ajar doors I don’t know why but they freak me out and this bastard must’ve of known that. I started shouting and yelling “HOLY SHIT WHO ARE YOU? ARE YOU REAL ARE YOU JUST LIVING IN MY FUCKING HOUSE!?!?!?” He didn’t respond just looked at me and disappeared into the abyss of my closet, I was too scared to move my closet isn’t even big enough for my clothes how did he even get in there? At this point I knew he wasn’t real as it was impossible to even crouch in there and I felt like a helpless child, clutching my blanket and holding my Kuromi plush and yea I’m a grown ass man with a kuromi doll leave me alone.

I didn’t sleep a damn wink and hell I don’t even think I winked at all my eyes didn’t leave the crack of the closet. When dawn finally broke I bolted out of the room and straight to my front door but what I saw made my blood run cold…

My front door had its handle took off… I was trapped it took me a while to realise that the man who I thought was the consequence of a bad trip was a real man who had somehow gotten into my house and was living there while I was non the wiser. I screamed like a goddamn banshee my voice when higher then I thought was possible I screamed, and screamed, and fucning screamed then I heard the footsteps…

They weren’t normal footsteps it was like he was walking in zigzags and he kept changing the rhythm walking faster and faster then slower and slower playing fucning mind games on me. My eyes never left the bedroom door expecting for him to walk out and kill me my mind was just “oh my god oh my god I’m gonna die this sick fuck is gonna kill me fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK” 

The door let out a creak that probably didn’t even last a millisecond but my eyes instinctively shut not wanting to look at what ever was about to walk out and kill me. The footsteps sounding more calculated like he was trying to be unpredictable one step was never in the same place twice. The only thoughts I had were “mom I’m sorry” I felt a searing pain in my head possible the worst I’ve ever felt I was so caught up in my thoughts I didn’t realise he was right infront of me now having his hand wrapped around my head slowly crushing it making sure I felt every single bit of pain I could of felt. In a last ditch effort I just let out a guttural scream something I didn’t know I could conjure up it sounded like I was the lead singer in a shitty goregrind band 

I finally opened my eyes being brave enough to see the face of my stalker. He was scarier than anything out of any horror this is because he was a completely normal looking man…
No scars no scary features he didn’t even look a weirdo you’d see in a coffee shop just looking at girls he was just a normal very human man…

Im sorry I didn't ask you to share your birth story in a safe place. I didn't realize just how horribly birth could go and still produce a living child. I'm sorry I didn't make more of an effort to stay when you pushed me away. I didn't realize you had PPD. I just thought you had outgrown me. 

If it makes you feel any better, my karma has arrived. I had a traumatic birth and not one of my friends cared even after I shared it with them (without them asking either). No one comes to visit. No one brings meals. No one shows up with a coffee because no one even knows that I've been up all night rocking a baby who refused to lay in his crib. No one comes to help me fold laundry or do dishes or sweep the floors while I try to figure out why my baby cries after he latches and my mind is swirling with how much I have to do but not wanting to miss out on moments with him. No one lets me nap. No one asks if I have the capacity to help before unloading on me. and when it's my turn to talk, they disappear.  And no one even noticed when I slowly faded out of society, drowning in laundry piles, dirty dishes, and tears as my brain repeatedly hurled insults about how I don't deserve the beautiful gift that is my son. 

I'm doing better now. I'm getting out of the house now. But no one is even here to celebrate that with me. Rant over I guess. ",34,1744120200.0,beyondthebump,7,0.97,False

I re-wrote what i was going to talk about like 5 times and now i feel like i should scrap it cause it no longer applies... which might be a hasty decision.

I had 3 ex schoolmates in their application year coming up to me for a review of HKU. Here is my personal year 1 experience. Let me just summarize my points beforehand. Only consider to take your offer if you are:

-Chinese. Even better if you’re from HK.

-Financially abundant

-Not applying for postgrad

-Seeking for a job in Asia

-No other competitive offers

Pros

-high rankings. has a very competitive title in Asia. strong career outcomes in china especially

-you can get good industry experiences here as a business student as hk is a global top3 financial hub.

-lol that’s literally it for me

Cons. I can go on forever. The pros that I have mentioned can be counter argued as well.

-even though hku is a target school in Asia. In a global scale especially EU/NA it’s just a NON TARGET ASS

-despite being one of the ‘top’ financial hubs, there’s just no deal flows here. Especially after the tariffs the HK market becomes the BIGGEST victim. I am convinced that I will be serving my MD coffee and closing no deals.

-the teaching is questionable 

-hk has the reputation of being a boring ass city and it’s true imo

-RIDICULOUSLY and objectively overpopulated. I have done research and our student population is roughly the same as uc Berkeley when their campus is 31 TIMES BIGGER THAN OURS. Library and canteen (during meal times) vacancies are always full. Elevators are ALWAYS broken. Most of the time you’d have to lineup just enter the campus, especially in the mornings (~20 mins). And I heard that our school is planning to increase student enrollment next year. It’s laughable

-Incredibly competitive(?). A cgpa above 3.0 (out of 4.3) is said to be good here when it’s considered ass over in the US(out of 4.0). That’s why I said do not come if you’re applying for masters. Grades in most courses are curved. You are competing with these top GAOKAO and dse nerds.

-Student quality is questionable as well. Some of the people in my courses including TAs just have no idea what they’re talking about. Communication is hard. Group projects experiences has been terrible. This school has a huge mix of geniuses and dumbasses.

-I pay 28k (3.6k usd)for a tiny ass crib. Living expenses here especially rent is absurdly high. The value for money here is just not it. My dad has been flaming me on how much money I’m spending when I’m literally only spending money on food.

-I am not going to comment too much on social life here as I think it’s different for people. For me personally it’s been a disaster.

My language is a little bit aggressive here but I’m actually just a very nonchalant guy. I never really complain about it. These are just opinions deep down in my heart.

In a way it's difficult because I love food, I find myself looking forward to my lunch at work everyday.  Then I look forward to dinner, and maybe a snack.  Pretty much all day long I'm thinking about food in the back of my head.

Right now that thought process is paused and it's a strange feeling.  It feels liberating but also a bit daunting.

1 lbs Ground Turkey
1Teaspoon Garlic Powder
1Teaspoon Salt
1Teaspoon Black Pepper
1Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper
1Teaspoon Onion Powder 
1Teaspoon Smoked Paprika 
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 and 1/2 teaspoons Rubbed Sage 
1 Tablespoon Brown Sugar

Mix all that together in a bowl, let it chill out in the fridge for about an hour (up to 8 hours) to mingle flavors, then fry it up

For the rest of the filling, use whatever you like. I like to dice up a large yellow onion, a bag of spinach and a bag of frozen hash browns. 

Spoon into burrito wraps, roll up, wrap in foil and freeze. I usually double the recipe so my wife and I each have a burrito every morning for an entire pay period as the recipe easily makes 8 burritos.",1,1744119781.0,VaushV,0,1.0,False
1judu85,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearfulAvoidant/comments/1judu85/me_35_m_with_my_31_f_almost_2_years_trying_to/,"Me [35 M] with my [31 F] - Almost 2 years, trying to figure things out before moving cross country together; need advice.","\*\*tl;dr\*\*: I’m 35, dating a 31-year-old woman for almost 2 years. We’re great together but facing some issues. I’m wondering if I should keep pushing forward with moving in together, or if our differences are too much. We have different views on finances, responsibility, and our sex life. What should I do?

I’m a 35-year-old male dating a 31-year-old female. We've been together for almost  
two years now. I’m a type A personality, a perfectionist, and I work in a  
high-stress, well-paying job. I’ve worked hard to get to where I am, and my  
career is incredibly important to me. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a  
strong type B personality. She tends to go through life based on her feelings,  
is less organized, and hasn’t quite figured out her professional path yet. She  
spent most of her 20s traveling and living abroad, while I was focused on my  
education and career. I appreciate her different perspective on life and  
I feel that she centers me away from my strong Type A personality. 

We communicate well—we respect each other and understand each other's needs, which  
I think is a big plus. But things haven’t always been easy. We’ve worked  
through growing pains and learned how to communicate better, and in general, I  
think we're in a good place emotionally.

However, there are a few big issues that have been weighing on me. First off, our sex  
life isn’t great. I tend to have avoidant tendencies when things aren’t feeling  
good in the relationship, and I’ve been working on this through therapy for a  
while now. I tend to pull away, however, being more mindful and present in the moment  
has helped me. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is anxious and needs constant  
physical contact to feel secure. I know this about her and I try my best to  
meet her needs, but there’s just never been great sexual chemistry between us,  
and it’s been a struggle.

We also have very different views when it comes to finances. She doesn’t quite  
understand what it means to budget, build wealth, etc. This creates some  
tension because I feel like I’m carrying more of the financial load. We’ve  
never really had a situation where she’s taken on a significant share  
financially—she’s only picked up the tab for dinner twice in our entire  
relationship. However, she does cook for us multiple times a week, so that’s  
something. That being said, I can feel resentment has built up over our time  
together and I sometimes change my behaviors so I avoid being on the hook for  
an expense (ie going to get a coffee alone)

Now, the big thing that’s been stressing me out: I’m moving across the country in  
August for a new job and to be closer to my family. The plan right now is for  
us to move together, but that’s where things get complicated. She’s nervous  
about moving far from her parents and feels like she’s making a big sacrifice  
without any guarantees about our relationship. I understand where she’s coming  
from, but I’m also really worried about her ability to contribute to a shared  
household and handle more responsibilities. This is all new to me in  
terms of previous relationships and I’m having trouble coming to grips about  
whether or not we are good “partners” versus having a good relationship. I love  
her, but I have my doubts about her ability to be a partner in life. 

I’ve started to question if I should move forward with this relationship or if I  
should break up and start fresh in a new town. I feel like I’m having some  
“grass is greener” syndrome. I know that I’m looking for a true partnership,  
but I can’t help feeling like there’s a mismatch in terms of responsibilities  
and expectations. I do have some financial resentment towards her too, which is  
hard to admit.

I want to support her if we do move in together and make sure she’s set up for  
success, but I can’t ignore how different our personalities are when it comes  
to responsibility and organization. She’s wonderful, kind, and has a beautiful  
soul, but I’m starting to feel like we’re on different pages when it comes to  
the “adulting” side of things. For example, she’s a wonderful communicator but  
struggles with the day-to-day grind of responsibilities—like managing a home,  
paying bills, and making sure things are running smoothly.

I’m 35, and I feel like I should have a little more stability and partnership in my  
life by now. I’m unsure whether to continue moving forward and hope that she  
finds her footing in this new place, or if it’s time to face the fact that we  
might not be as aligned as I thought.",1,1744119683.0,FearfulAvoidant,2,1.0,False

Now I just feel the craving and feel extremely bored with life. This tends to demotivate me and with lack of quick dopamine-seeking activities like irregulated phone use and caffeine, it just gets difficult. So I am using Armodafinil as a way to deal with the study work that I've to do for an academic job. 

But life has never been so calm. I don't overthink anymore and I can imagine things which I failed to do when on caffeine (it's a bit in shades of grey right now). I do things and I like keeping busy. Silly thoughts and feelings occur now and then, but I recognize them and cope with them through calm reflection or/and meditation. My restlessness and anger have reduced drastically, and I am able to reflect more on my habits and personal issues. Sometimes I use l-theanine and magnesium for anxiety that is connected to shortness of breath. 

Hopefully things will go on better. Sure it has taken away a need to keep myself busy with coffee as a sort of habitual pattern (Like snacking is,which people may do all the time because they feel lack of interest/focus otherwise).

1judrta,https://i.redd.it/4kdjnzpp6mte1.jpeg,3-month progress update,"39(F) with a family history of high Cholesterol and heart disease on my mother’s side. I just received my results after I implemented dietary changes a little less than 3 months ago. The first number is from mid-January, the second number is from yesterday:

- Cholesterol total: 223 to 181
- HDL: still 59
- Triglycerides: 71 to 64
- LDL: 147 to 107
- Non-HDL: 164 to 122

Overall, I’m happy, but obviously still concerned about LDL. My diet was pretty strict at first, but I did start allowing myself occasional eggs and I smoked some weed for a few days before the test (not sure if that could’ve affected the results). 

I could further improve my diet by eating more plant based than I have been (I eat chicken or fish every day). I’ve replaced half’n’half in coffee with low-fat milk (it was hard, because I hate the sweeter taste, but I’m getting used to it). Maybe I could work on excluding any dairy that’s not fat free.

What do you think? Is LDL typically more stubborn? Should I give it more time and do another test in a few months or should I consider a low-dose statin at this point?

I’m sensitive and get hurt easily; he has a big ego and narcissistic traits.

Tension started when his wife — who clearly doesn’t like our side of the family — got pregnant with their second child. Three months into the pregnancy, almost everyone on her side already knew. I found out late, and our mom only heard through a distant cousin of my sister-in-law. That already set a tone of exclusion.

Later, my brother told me they were going for an ultrasound to find out the baby’s sex. When I asked him about it, he said they wouldn’t tell me because they were planning a gender reveal party. I was like what the... why even bring it up then?

Yesterday morning was the day of the gender reveal party, I stopped by his house since our mom and niece were there. I expected a little coffee or a moment together, but the atmosphere was cold. I tried to help him with some advice on his back pain, based on research I’ve done. He actively looked for ways to argue, praising doctors as if I were attacking them (I wasn’t) and totally dismissing what I had to tell him. I left saying, “Sorry I tried to help you,” and went home.

I tried not to let it ruin my day, but I ended up staying in bed for hours. Late afternoon after I rushed into all my tasks for the day, tired and stressed, I got a message from him: “Are you coming?” I didn’t reply.

We are very much in love after two years of being together and it’s great. 

After getting a new job a few years ago, he now earns a lot more money than me already. And I earn a medium income for London so I can survive. My biggest fear is becoming a wife that doesn’t work (not judging) because I am a career person and my mother did nothing and she’s mentally ill and I just have this awful fear of losing my mind when my kids get older and I have nothing. It may be silly but that is why I stress so much. 

Anyways he is kind and paid for my birthday dinner and has gotten me lovely birthday and Christmas presents of course. But we split everything else down the middle. I rent with my friend and he can afford to buy a house in London by himself that’s the sort of gap we’re looking at. But we put the same into the joint account, split holidays and meals down the middle and it’s actually affecting my money. 

I budget everything down to meal deals for lunch at work and have started cycling to work to save money. I plan for holidays and buying a new dress or top every month and going out for dinner so I have a nice life I enjoy. It’s not like I am broke it’s that I can’t match his lifestyle. 

I accidentally washed his linen blazer last year and it ruined it. I do all his washing even though we work the same hours. He asked me to replace it because he loved that item of clothing so much. The blazer costs £150 and I’ve put it into my money tracker and it will put me in debt for two months with everything else I need to pay for. I’ve asked him to please wait for me to be able to buy it and I honestly really hoped he’d at least say we can split it. I complain to him maybe once a week being upset that I work long hours for not enough money and even said I might get a Saturday job. 

Is it stupid to hope we would stop splitting things straight down the middle and that maybe he would suggest I don’t fully pay for the new blazer….?",1,1744119438.0,relationship_advice,13,1.0,False
1judqqf,https://i.redd.it/tzbb0usg6mte1.jpeg,Reggio by Trudon,"I recently started burning the three-wick Reggio by Trudon, and I have to say—this one really shines in the spring. I generally prefer Trudon’s three-wick format over their single or five-wick options. The single wicks just don’t offer enough throw for my open-concept home, and while the five-wick jars are absolutely stunning, they take a bit longer to develop a full melt pool—so I usually reserve them for entertaining or long stretches at home.

The three-wick, in my opinion, hits the sweet spot: a solid burn, good wax performance, and enough scent strength to fill a medium to large room without being overwhelming.

I’ve been saving Reggio for warmer weather, and now that spring has arrived in Florida, it feels like the perfect time. I’m pretty selective when it comes to citrus scents—especially living in a hot climate with 1000% humidity, where “citrus season” borders on the religious—but Reggio really delivers. For context, I gravitate toward fragrance profiles that lean fresh and clean: men’s cologne-inspired blends, bright white florals, and citrus notes like bergamot are always favorites.

Trudon describes Reggio as grapefruit and mandarin oil, and I find that accurate. Citrus lovers will understand the nuance here—grapefruit has a vibrant, fresh bite with a subtle bitterness that keeps it from feeling cloying or musky. It’s an energizing scent, ideal for mornings sipping coffee or hot tea. Mandarin adds warmth and brightness, and if you pay attention, there’s often a whisper of something almost floral in the background.

This is definitely a spring/summer scent—it has a vitality to it. I wouldn’t reach for it when I’m winding down for the night, but it’s perfect for daytime.

In terms of throw, it’s decent—but not the strongest I’ve experienced from Trudon. That’s to be expected, though. Citrus oils are mostly top notes: they sparkle in the opening but don’t always have staying power. Part of me wishes Reggio had a grounded base to extend its longevity just a bit, but I still appreciate it for what it is: bright, uplifting, and clean.

If you’re used to powerhouses like Ernesto or Cyrnos, this won’t deliver the same kind of projection. Still, it’s a beautiful scent, and the vessel—deep, regal blue—is absolutely stunning.

Would I repurchase? Maybe? Probably not, only because of the price point for the three-wick and my undying love for Ernesto. But I’m glad I tried it—it’s a lovely way to switch things up from my usual go-tos. If you love Citrus scents, then give it a try. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. The single wick version is probably better suited for a smaller bedroom or powder room.

I am SAHM and my husband has a somewhat flexible work schedule. He is suppose to be there by a certain time but doesn't need to clock in or report to anyone most days. 

Our days have shifted slightly due to seasonal and time change. Our kids are going to bed a bit later so our days are starting later ( if i am lucky but not always). My husband often wakes up early about 530 to 6 and works out. My oldest will often hangout with him during this time. I have zero issues with this as I want to encourage him to make time for himself and prioritize his health, as I am do the same. 

The issue is lately he has been getting a later start to his day and expanding his  workout to the point he only has time to grab a quick shower, cup of coffee and out the door. This leaves me with all the morning responsibilities.  Dishes, dogs, breakfast etc. I understand some it just naturally will be on me seeing I am SAHM but also how lucky it must be to just not have to even consider other things and just take care of your own needs first thing in the morning?! 

Also, we have gotten into some fights about our mornings because he has told me many times he gets frustrated when I am not up by a certain time so we can hang out a drink coffee together. I often struggle to get up because I had rough night with my daughter getting up a lot. 

I should note, I spend my mornings rushing around to do housework so I can get us all ready to leave and I go to the gym with child care that only has certain hours, so we need to leave and from there I try to plan some sort of fun outing like a playground or running errands. We also have evening activities/Sports for the kids so getting things done in the morning is essential to my routine and sanity.

1judie7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Non_Medical_ADHD/comments/1judie7/operating_manual_version_40_code_name_think_scope/,"operating manual version 4.0 (code name ""!think"") scope","more than anything else by far, ver 4.0 will reflect the culmination of my declared vendetta against thinking.

while ver 3.0 incl a dramatic evolution / steps forward in executive functioning, ver 4.0 will focus on complete elimination of thinking in as many areas as possible; largely through 'organic design' like intersections and processes like 'hands off' food inventory management, e.g. 'UHT milk / oatmeal'.

ver 1.0 and 2.0, while beginning to produce (largely via serendipitous byproducts if simply paying attention / introspection / testing) many seeds that will grow into many of the more elegant *EF* solutions of vers 3.0 and 4.0, their primary focus was still more on fundamental memory impairment accommodation via mechanisms that *enabled* placing information at the point of performance; but not necessarily nailing *what* information to place *where/when* or *why*.

**ver 4.0 (!think) scope:**

'stick to the plan' + a 'stick-to-able' plan

'stick to the plan' means a move away from 'game planning' and the need to 'game plan'

'stick-to-able' plan means, among other things, trusting the system, e.g. that there is no longer a need to 'game plan'

this will be accomplished via an aggressive push/sprint to heavily scrutinize/eliminate anything requiring thought.

reduction and elimination of thought will occur at different levels and over multiple stages.

for example, my daily routine is already solved and has been solved for some time and is simply *morning routine > work > evening routine*. 

i anticipate no reason for this ever to change as it's been serving me quite well.

...and my evening routine is quite well defined at a detailed level, e.g. *snack > gym > dinner > shower > meditate > chill > bedtime routine*.

i do continue to refine my evening routine, although mostly from a food/nutritional variety/energy/strength training recovery perspective, which is all just evolution/gravy with the primary impetus mainly being curiosity about an alternative sequences, e.g. to work in smoothies to augment nutritional variety, or to address weaknesses such as giving into pizza cravings when i let my blood sugar drop too low.

some example features for version 4.0 incl:

replace anything written down or requiring thought with habit formation / brain re-wiring.

one example is what i call '!urgent', which means that i no longer need to consider whether there is anything urgent today bc it's obvious whenever there is anything urgent. the corollary to this is that, if there is nothing *obviously* urgent then that is nothing urgent. what does this mean? it means that i no longer have to bisect (a la 'binary non-sequencing') my task list by urgent/non-urgent.

another feature is to practice 'navigating away' from all 'crutches', e.g. whiteboard, until brain is hard-wired to accept that i just need to 'minimally operate' the 'machine'/system, e.g. i only need to engage the whiteboard when i naturally 'collide' with it because my kitchen is a reliable and consistent intersection and because every transition from to/from a charge/discharge period involves a trip to the kitchen because discharge periods are at mealtimes.

another feature is what i'm calling 'wander/sand' with the idea being to bypass placing 'piddly' (less than 15 min) items (*side note: almost any task can be broken down into 'piddly' items)* on the whiteboard altogether bc (although my brain refuses to naturally accept this; even though i know this intellectually) 1) there is rarely anything ever urgent (and, like i said above, recognizing/remembering/getting urgent things done is never a problem and 2) there is almost always enough natural/organic idle time (e.g. while laundry is on, rice/chicken cooking, water boiling, etc.) throughout the day to get all the 'piddly' things done; esp if I...

...avoid social media/TV/guitar. this is huge as these things are almost always my go to when i have small periods of time that my brain refuses to think can be productive.

another feature is setting up self-regulating systems, e.g. i buy UHT milk (which lasts a long time before opened) in larger numbers but smaller quantities because otherwise i will have to throw out milk. but i can still make sure i have plenty of milk when i have guests and also as a buffer for when grocery is out of stock; which happens occasionally. having three or four extra containers permanently solves my milk inventory problem. 

the more i can do the same permanently and automatically resolve other needs (like i've already done with cooking, grocery shopping, other domestic duties, etc.), the more i can just 'operate the machine' without thinking.

the 'layers'/'levels' i mention above are where interim testing and/or minimal thinking can be required due to variations in timing of things and or things like the universe serving up things that aren't routine or fully automated. 

for example, i don't know exactly what my weekend list will look like, but i know what my productivity periods are and i know how/whether anything should even be on my whiteboard (as i mentioned above and per 'sand/wander' strategy) and my morning/evening routine doesn't change on the weekends vs weekdays bc all 'work' gets done between 8-5 just like for my job during the weekdays, etc. etc.

similarly, i also have existing strategies for (what used to be) curveballs such as my daughters coming over tonight which i'm going to easily 'absorb' by using my lunchtime/'me time' to go to the gym, etc.

i also already have in place ONE (you heard that right; i only have ONE!) automated 'point of performance' push notification in the form of alarms on my smartphone for 'coffee > water > brush/floss teeth'.

ok that's enough for now. i'll update this as things get completed and may pin it also.",1,1744118759.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Then I did 1 but by spreading the dose out to 2 .5 shots. It’s been crazy as I have been eating really healthy and clean etc but going up and down for months. So frustrating!!

Because I’m trying to break my plateau lol.

So the longer I go without eating in the am the quicker I drop weight. So I figured why not try intermittent fasting?

At 5’3”, the weight loss is very obvious (see post history for photos at 37 pounds lost two months ago), so anyone who hasn’t seen me since December, or even January, will notice the difference if they saw me today.

I am now at the point where my doctors have said I am ready for maintenance, which convinced me that I am ready to buy new clothes. I have been saving for a new wardrobe for months now, so I was excited (and nervous) to finally make it happen. My husband and I made a date this past Saturday. 

It was quite an experience to try on clothes for a completely different body, both bad and good, and I might go into detail about it in another post if people are curious (I even had a mini-meltdown lol). But to make the long story short, I basically purchased clothing from brands that are normally associated with thin people (Alo Yoga, Reformation, Everlane, Aritzia, etc), and felt overall really good about my purchases. I have never fit in a size 4/6 before.

My husband’s brother and his family were also at the mall so we met up for a coffee. They all know the journey I am on and have been incredibly supportive so I wasn’t thinking anything of seeing them while carrying quite the number of shopping bags.

However, my husband’s sister-in-law was also there, and the last time I saw her was around August last year, when I was at my heaviest at around 185 pounds. I got along with her then—I thought she was fun and had a wicked sense of humor. This time, though, she completely ignored me when I said hi and was ignoring me when we sat down for coffee, but she did sit beside me at the table.

At about 20 minutes in, when my husband and his brother were deep in a discussion and his wife and I stopped conversing because she had to deal with a baby that was starting to get fussy, the sister-in-law then started whispering to me about how I was offending people in bigger bodies by losing weight and blatantly buying from brands that were not body positive. She basically went on a rant about being disappointed that I fell for diet culture and “thin propaganda.”

I was taken aback and was just shocked at was I was hearing. I had prepared for all sorts of rude comments about my weight loss, but not this. It was honestly hard to parse through what she was saying, because she started going on about how I was contributing to a world that made it hard for fat people to maneuver, which I wasn’t immediately able to comprehend. I was getting really exasperated, and in my frustration, I retorted in a raised voice, “I don’t care about what other people think, I care about my health!”

That got the attention of everyone else at the table. My husband’s brother realized what was happening and said, “Jesus Christ, can you stop with your fat liberation crap? Some of us just want to live long enough to see our kids’ milestones, you know?” 

She must have realized she was outnumbered, so she huffed “you guys are assholes” and then got up and left.

My brother-in-law apologized profusely on her behalf and started to tell us what his sister had gotten into—fat acceptance, fat liberation. Stuff that I had never heard of before, but I have no social media other than LinkedIn so I would not have had prior exposure to it. She is obese herself—like the rest of the world, she had gained weight during COVID and despite trying very hard, could not lose it and gained even more. She is petite like me, so I know how much of a toll that weight can have.

That was on Saturday—it’s Tuesday now and I am still trying to process that encounter and now beginning to educate myself on this movement, so I can respond better whenever I see her next. I know this movement is more fringe than mainstream, but I am still sad that our desire to live healthier lives is being demonized this way. I have a lot of empathy for my husband’s sister-in-law and I don’t want to shut her out.

1judaol,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1judaol/13_proven_strategies_to_master_hypnotic_writing/,13 Proven Strategies To Master Hypnotic Writing,"Stop begging people to read your stories. Instead hypnotize ‘em with your words. 


What is hypnotic writing:

When I asked my mentor, can you teach me the art of hypnotic writing.

She just pulled a gun out of nowhere and pointed it straight between my eyes while saying…

“That's the secret known to only a handful of elite copywriters on planet Earth. If I reveal it, I'd have to kill you.”

Luckily, that didn't happen.

But did you notice what I did there?

I just sucked you into my story like a vacuum pump on steroids.

That's what hypnotic writing is all about.

Many writers think, to write hypnotically, they'd have to put their audience in a hypnotic trance.

Fortunately, this isn't the case.

Hypnotic writing has nothing to do with fancy hypnosis techniques.

Instead, hypnotic writing is all about putting (and keeping) your audience in an awakening trance until they finish reading your content all the way to the end.

It’s the art through which you force your audience to read your content till the final full stop— even when the dog is pooping on the floor… the pizza delivery guy has been ringing the bell for the last 20 minutes… or even when the dinner is ready.

The point is:

Hypnotic writing grabs the balls of your audience and whispers in their ears: “If you don't read this content till the end, you'll miss out big times.”

Now, here you might be wondering…

If Hypnotic writing is sooo powerful, it must be difficult to learn.

But lemme break the good news.

It’s not.

In fact, you can master hypnotic writing even if you’re brand new at writing. 

How? Glad you asked:

Just start implementing these 13 proven strategies into your writing, and sooner you’ll become a beast at writing hypnotic pieces of content. 

1– Emotional Storytelling:

As I’ve described earlier, hypnotic writing is all about grabbing and retaining attention. 

And one of the best ways to achieve this is to stimulate the emotions of your target readers.

Here’s an example:

A few weeks ago, I wrote a sales page in the survival niche.

I could've started the sales page with this plain headline:

Discover how this bag can save your family in emergency situations

You see, this headline is okay-ish. 

It'll get the job done.

But the problem…

This headline isn't hypnotic. 

And the worst part: 

Every other copywriter can write like this.

I had to do something different as I was hired as a hypnotic copywriter not a typical direct-response-ish.

So, here's how I began the sales page…

I was standing there… frozen… terrified… while the beads of sweat entering my eyes from my forehead… and my 9 year-old daughter asking…

Daddy, are we going to die? ):

If you're the type of man who’d practically move mountains to protect his family, read this alarming story…


You see how I twisted a generic direct response heading into a hypnotic headline just by stimulating the emotions of the readers and giving it a story angle.

Key Takeaway:

If you too wanna write hypnotic content, consider telling emotional stories.


2– Use you your

Another one of the best hypnotic writing techniques is to use the words “you” and “your”.

When I broke down the marketing materials written by my copywriting mentor…I was stunned.

Because in almost every single sentence, she was using “you”, and “your” intentionally.

I asked her and she said, “Yes, that's another way to write hypnotic content”.

Key Takeaway:

Sprinkle the words “you” & “your”, if you wanna hypnotize your readers.

3— Use open loops:

Before I delve deeper into the concepts of open loops…

I’ve got a quick question for you.

Have you ever binge-watched an entire Netflix series in a single night—even when your eyes were swelling to death… and you desperately wanted to do something else (probably more important)… but still, you couldn’t take your eyes off the screen. (happened to me many times lol).

If you said “yes”.

Let me tell you… 

You fell for the traps of open loops.

Whenever our mind encounters an open loop, it gets stuck there until the loop is closed. 

Why? Because our mind is hard-wired to close open loops.

That’s why when you inject open loops into your writing, your audience can’t help but end up reading your content all the way to the end.

If you have no clue of how to use open loops, I’d highly encourage you to keep reading. 

Because at the end of this story, I’ll teach you 3 easy ways to master the art of opening & closing loops.

Key Takeaway: 

Use open loops to hijack/ retain their attention.

4— Write in A.B.T framework 

As a writer, I’m a big fan of Hollywood movies. 

I love how Hollywood writers keep a certain scene going… build tension between the scenes…and finally show us the progress of a certain scene.

But have you ever wondered?

How do they achieve this?

Have no idea?

Well, worry not cause I’m gonna break it down for you…

Hollywood fiction writers use a simple framework called A.B.T.

Where A stands for AND.
B stands for BUT.
And T stands for THEREFORE.

Now, let’s see this framework in action.

Example of a story using ABT framework…

This is the story of a young boy named James.

James is obsessed with the idea of a time travel machine.

After years of sleepless nights, he finally devises a time travel machine.

(AND) decides to go back to the moment where his parents met for the very first time.

(BUT) mistakenly, he distracts his father from meeting his mother.

James realizes his painful mistakes.

(AND) now he knows if he doesn’t do something, he won’t exist in the future.

(THEREFORE), he has to come up with a solid plan.

(BUT) James….

Okay, I’d stop here. And ask you this…

Did I keep the scene going? Did I create the tension in your mind? And did I show you the progress of the story?

Of course I did.

And the good news for you…

You can do the same by just using the A.B.T framework.

Can you too use this simple framework into your own writing? Let me know in the comment section.

5— Momentum 

Do you know what the no 1 goal of your first sentence is?

The job of your 1st sentence is to make the reader read your 2nd sentence.

The job of your 2nd sentence is to make the reader read your 3rd sentence. And so on.

Pretty simple. Right?

But here’s the main question…

How do you achieve this?

Well, you can effortlessly accomplish this goal by using momentum phrases/words.

If you’ve been reading my stories for a while now, you must have seen certain phrases like “here’s the main question”...  “the best part”...  “the worst part”... and “Let me ask you this”.

These are the examples of momentum phrases.

These phrases help me build momentum in my writing. 

Here are some phrases that can help you build momentum in your writing…

Let me explain WHY/HOW/WHAT
Here’s the thing
The best part
The worst part
Let me break it down for you
But what does this mean for you
That’s not at all
Think about it this way
Here’s what I mean
The point is
Here’s the good news for you
I know what you’re thinking
You might be wondering


6— Use Future Pacing:

This is one of the most powerful hypnotic writing techniques. 

I (almost) always rely on this when writing long form sales pages/ VSLs.

Whenever I'm aiming to write a hypnotic piece of content, I hook the conscious mind of the targeted reader, and use future pacing to appeal to their subconscious brain.

How? 

Well, Let me try this on you. CRAZY NOOO!

I’d try to appeal to your subconscious brain using future pacing— like right now.

Close your eyes and practice deep breathing for the next 5—7 seconds.

Done? 

(The technique starts from here)

I want you to just imagine this scenario…

It’s 9A.M. You just woke up… grabbed your first cup of coffee… and opened your laptop.

There you see…You’ve got 10, 50, 100, and even 200 new followers on your Medium profile.

Now, you’ve just opened your Medium Partner Program dashboard… And the sight couldn’t be more exciting cause you’ve already earned $132 in just the last 4 hours.

And the best part: 

You just achieved this milestone without any paid ads… ruthlessly engaging with other writers… or mindlessly posting your stories in FB groups.

You smile… finish your coffee… and head off to your favorite morning routine.

Now, what if I told you this isn’t just a dream.

It’s the reality for many writers who are taking advantage of my new e-book “ 10 Proven Ways To Write Hypnotic Medium Stories”

If you too want to convert this dream into your reality, just click the button below and download the e-book for free.

Did you see how I just spoke to your subconscious brain?

Keytakeway:

Use future pacing and appeal to their subconscious brain.

7— Trigger their senses:

Don’t just write. Try to bring all the senses into your writing. 

For example, I don’t always write “so” like “so”. 

I almost always write “so” like “sooo”. 

Why? Because “sooo” sounds better to ears than just a plain “so”.

Similarly, don’t just write like she was tensed. 

Write like: The beads of sweat were entering her eyes from her forehead. You see how I triggered your sight sense in my writing. 

Another example: When I entered the dark cave, I felt something sharp under my feet. See, how I triggered the touch sense.

Key Takeaway: Don’t just write. Try to bring these senses (Smell… Taste… Sight… Touch… Listen) into your writing.  

8— Hypnotic and NLP commands 

This technique is one of my favorites. 

No hypnotic writing can be done without hypnotic/NLP commands.

When I’m writing a sales copy, I always use hypnotic and NLP commands to handle the objection of the target audience. 

Here are few examples of hypnotic/ NLP commands:

As you probably already know (way too powerful to bypass mental objections): Quick example: As you probably already know, weight loss supplements do more harm than good.
By the time you finish reading this… Quick Example: By the time you finish reading this story, you’d have learned 10 hypnotic phrases to instantly double your sales.
When you try this… Quick Example: When you say these 12 words to your man, he’ll instantly become emotionally obsessed with you.
You’re probably wondering/thinking: How can this work for you? Well, that’s exactly what Sara was wondering. But after trying my system, Sarah…
What if I told you: Quick Example: What if I told you this isn’t the case. You too can write hypnotically even if you’re a brand new writer.


9— Rhythm in writing  Gary Quote

This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. 

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. 

And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important."" 


I love this quote from gary. Why? Because it perfectly shows us how to create rhythm in writing.

Key Takeaway: Use sentences of varying lengths to create rhythms in your writing.


10— Weaving personality 

Have you ever wondered how elite writers separate themselves from average ones?

Well, there could be a heck lotta things they'd be using behind closed doors.

But there is one thing that always gets the job done for them.

And that is: 

They always weave their unique personality into their writing.

If you carefully break down the content of elite writers, you’d notice, their writing carries a certain personality.

Now, you might be wondering: 

But Farid, how the heck I inject personality into my writing.

Well, I can give you 3 simple and stupidly easy ways to inject personality into your writing.

1–Add anecdotes… 2–A touch of humor… 3–Bend grammar and even writing rules sometimes.

Anecdote with a touch of humor:

I recently went to the interview for the post of junior copywriter. I was surprised to see the interviewer. Cause she was beautiful as heck. While looking at my portfolio she said, wow, you’ve got an amazing portfolio… and also, I like your name too… I replied… “Well, you can have it as your surname…lol

You can do this by adding a touch of humor and sometimes bending grammar rules… and showing your beliefs on popular topics. 

Now, let’s break each one down to its core and practically see how to convert a boring content into a hypnotic content driven by personality.

11- Stretch your thoughts:

In case you haven’t noticed yet, I’ve already used this technique multiple times in this story.

Remember when I said:

Hypnotic writing is all about forcing your audience to read your content—(from here I tried stretching my thoughts) even when the dog is pooping on the floor… the pizza guy has been ringing the bell… or even when the dinner is ready.

Did you notice how I stretched my thoughts and showed you the real power of hypnotic writing. 

Can you spot where else I stretched my thoughts? Let me know in the comment section.

Key Takeaway: Practice stretching your thoughts


12- Optimize your content for audience awareness levels

Have you ever read an article and felt like smashing your phone against the wall…

Because that article revolved around the stuff you already knew. (Happened to me several times lol)

If you said: YES

Chances are that article wasn’t optimized for audience awareness levels.

9 out of 10 new writers have no clue of what audience awareness levels are.

And I highly doubt even intermediate writers understand this crucial concept.

Typically, your audience falls in these 3 awareness levels:

Unaware: In this stage, your audience is completely unaware about the given topic.
Partially aware: In this stage, your audience knows the surface level stuff about the given topic.
Completely aware: In this stage, your audience has done all the digging part. They know every little thing about the given topic.

Confused? Well, I won’t blame you… Because I know for a fact that this topic is a bit tricky. 

But you don’t need to worry, because at the end of this story, I’ll teach you each and everything about audience awareness levels with practical examples. (There won’t be any surface level bullshit advice.)

13- Create Mental Images:

As you probably already know, our brain processes information in images.

So, in order to better connect with your audience’s mind, you’d have to create and direct mental movies.

How? 

Let’s see a quick example:

What if I tell you:

Go somewhere…

You see this line isn't creating any mental movie. It’s plain and boring.

But what if I told you this…

Go somewhere and bring something…

Still, not that powerful…

But what about this…
Go to the kitchen, and bring something for me to eat…

Now, this one is okay-ish. But still, it needs improvement.

What about this…

Go to the kitchen… open the fridge and take out my favorite chocolate flavored cornetto enriched crunchy wafers and cookies.

Didn’t you just picture yourself stepping into the kitchen… opening up the fridge… and taking out a chocolate flavored ice-cream.

See, that’s the power of creating and directing mental movies.

1jud6to,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jud6to,Should I keep the old tiles or replace them with wood flooring????,"Hello! We’re moving in a few months into our future home, and I’m facing a decor dilemma. We're at the planning & moodboard stage for now but we have to decide soon what renovation we'll do.

So the entire house has high-quality but very outdated pinkish-beige tiles (about 25cm squares). They're 30 yo and they're in perfect condition, but I'm not sure they’ll match the style I'm looking for.



My goal is to create something warm, cozy, comfortable, practical, and kid-friendly. So I tried to make the moodboard for our living room with both flooring and I’d love your thoughts:



**Can the tiles work, or should we just install wooden flooring?** 



* Pros for keeping the tiles imo: budget!!! (they're in the entire house so it'll cost a lot to replace them). Also they're in perfect condition and I don't know, it feels like a waste to remove good quality tiles just because they're old-fashioned...
* Pros for replacing them with wooden flooring: looks nicer and more recent. Feels warmer...



**I'd also love to hear any feedback on the moodboards please!!!**



\-----

A few details:

The room combines a TV/lounge area and a dining space. Also the lounge area will be a play area for our daughters, hence the many baskets.

We want to keep our existing furniture: the dark grey furniture (TV stand, coffee table and cabinet), the black sofa, the dining table and chairs. The other furniture we're purchasing. And I really really want persian rugs.

I’ve also attached photos of the room with other occupants' furniture (two different families, not us).

# 2025's Best Refillable Nespresso Capsules: Save money & the Planet (Review & Comparison)

Are you a Nespresso aficionado who’s looking to cut costs without sacrificing your daily caffeine fix? Or perhaps you're increasingly aware of the environmental impact of those single-use aluminum capsules and seeking a more eco-conscious solution? If you nodded yes to either of these questions, you've landed in the right place. This comprehensive guide dives deep into the world of refillable Nespresso capsules, offering a detailed review and comparison to help you choose the perfect reusable Nespresso capsule for your needs in 2025.

We understand the allure of Nespresso: the convenience,the consistent brew,and the rich crema. But let’s face it, those single-use pods add up – both in cost and environmental waste.That's why more and more coffee lovers are turning to refillable options, seeking a best-of-both-worlds scenario: the convenience of Nespresso with the sustainability and cost savings of reusable coffee pods nespresso.

[[explore Top Rated refillable reusable nespresso capsule on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=refillable reusable nespresso capsule)
## Why Choose a Refillable Nespresso Capsule?

Before we delve into specific product recommendations, let’s explore the compelling reasons to make the switch to a refillable nespresso capsule.It's not just about saving a few bucks; it's about making a purposeful choice towards responsible consumption.

*   **Meaningful Cost Savings:** This is perhaps the most immediate and tangible benefit. Over time, the cost of single-use Nespresso capsules can be ample. By investing in a set of refillable coffee capsules nespresso, you dramatically reduce your coffee costs. You'll be paying for ground coffee, which is significantly cheaper than pre-packaged capsules, leading to long term savings nespresso refillable. Imagine redirecting those savings towards trying new and exotic coffee beans!

*   **Reduce Your Environmental Footprint:** Single-use Nespresso capsules, while frequently enough recyclable, still contribute to waste. Many end up in landfills,taking hundreds of years to decompose. Opting for eco kind nespresso pods and reducing waste aligns with a more enduring lifestyle.It is taking responsibility for your consumption which is crucial nowadays.

*   **Unleash Your Inner Barista: Greater Coffee Customization:** Tired of being limited to Nespresso's pre-selected flavors? Refillable capsules give you the freedom to experiment with different coffee blends, roasts, and origins. You can finally use that locally roasted, fair-trade coffee you've been eyeing! This level of control opens up a whole new world of flavor possibilities, allowing you to tailor your coffee experience to your exact preferences.

*   **Higher Quality Coffee (Potentially):** While official Nespresso capsules offer a consistent experience, the quality of the pre-ground coffee inside can sometimes be questionable. When you use your own ground coffee with a refillable capsule, you have complete control over the freshness and quality of the beans. This can lead to a noticeably richer and more flavorful cup of coffee.

## Understanding Different Types of Refillable Nespresso Capsules

The market for Nespresso pod alternative options has exploded in recent years, offering a variety of materials, designs, and compatibility options. Understanding these differences is essential for making an informed decision.

*   **Stainless Steel Nespresso Capsules:** These are often considered the most durable and long-lasting option. Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion and high temperatures, ensuring years of reliable use. They're generally easy to clean and often dishwasher-safe.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing Refillable Nespresso Capsules

With so many choices available, how do you determine the best nespresso refillable capsules for your needs? Here are some crucial factors to evaluate:

*   **Compatibility:** Ensure the refillable capsule is compatible with your Nespresso machine model (Original line or Vertuo). Nespresso vertuo refillable capsules require different designs from Nespresso Original Line capsules. Verify compatibility thoroughly before purchasing or running the risk of damage.

*   **Material:** As discussed earlier, consider the material's durability, safety, and heat resistance. Stainless steel is generally the preferred option, but high-quality aluminum and BPA-free plastic can also be viable choices.

*   **Ease of Use:** How easy is it to fill, use, and clean the capsule? Look for designs that are simple to fill and easy to disassemble for thorough cleaning. Some products include a refillable nespresso pod filling tool.

*   **Seal Tightness:** A good seal is crucial for achieving proper pressure during brewing, which directly impacts the crema and flavor of your coffee. Read reviews and look for capsules with reliable sealing mechanisms such as sealable nespresso capsules.*   **durability:** A refillable capsule is meant to last. Consider how often you will be using it, and purchase a capsule that is durable enough and has a reputation for longevity.*   **Cleaning:** Some capsules require special tools, while others can just have the grounds tapped out.[[Explore Top Rated refillable reusable nespresso capsule on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=refillable reusable nespresso capsule)

## Tips for Using Refillable Nespresso Capsules Successfully

to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience with your refillable nespresso pods, keep these tips in mind:

*   **Choose the Right Coffee Grind:** The grind size is crucial for achieving optimal extraction. Experiment with different grind settings to find the sweet spot, depending on your type of coffee. A grind that is slightly coarser than that you use in an espresso machine would work well.

*   **Tamp the Coffee Properly:** Tamping, or firmly pressing the coffee grounds into the capsule, is also a must. Using a refillable nespresso capsules with tamper, or a separate tamper tool, ensures proper compaction and even extraction. If the coffee is not tamped properly, the water will flow too quickly thru the grounds, resulting in a weak and watery brew.

*   **Don't Overfill the Capsule:** Overfilling the capsule can cause it to jam or even damage your machine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the correct amount of coffee to use.

*   **Clean Your Capsules Regularly:** Thoroughly clean your capsules after each use to prevent coffee residue buildup, which can affect the taste of your coffee and damage your machine.

*   **Experiment and Have Fun:** Don't be afraid to experiment with different coffee blends, roasts, and grind sizes to find your perfect refillable Nespresso recipe. The possibilities are endless!

Reason for selling: got gifted a Flair Pro 3

You'll get the lever body with the base and drip tray, the water chamber, the dispersion screen, the coffee basket with a removable flow control cap, the plunger along with the pressure gauge stopper with the Flair pressure gauge. For accessories, there's the dosing ring, dosing cup and steel tamper, all original accessories, along with a shot mirror and the (green) silicone funnel (which I use to dose beans with and preheat the water chamber on a kettle), which I'll be giving away with the set. It comes with the original carrying case too, all packed and ready to be shipped.

Please note, you'll need an espresso-capable grinder to use this machine to the best of its ability, and a kettle.

It's got the Pro-capable conversion ring so you could, in theory, upgrade to a Flair Pro 2 or Pro 3 by just sourcing the brewhead, to use with the same lever body.

I've used, enjoyed and learned from this machine for a long time and it is easily one of the best bang for buck true espresso makers, period. And the build quality is truly something that can end up lasting you a lifetime. Selling it is like selling a piece of home away, but alas, countertop-space trumps sentimentality.

I purchased it initially for 28k, is still listed at 24k on Something's Brewing, and I'm selling it for 15k excluding shipping, from Mumbai. Or if you live close by, you can take a look at the machine yourself and pick up it up.

Even on weekends I end up doing the same stuff — maybe with different snacks.

Lately, I’ve been fantasizing about what it would feel like to hit “shuffle” on my day. Like waking up and having a wheel spin with totally random tasks:

\- Go to a museum  

\- Write a letter to your 12-year-old self  

\- Try a fruit you’ve never eaten  

\- Call someone you haven’t talked to in a year  

\- Paint badly on purpose  

\- Take a different route to the grocery store  

\- Sit in the sun for 10 minutes doing absolutely nothing

I don’t know... maybe routines keep me grounded, but I think part of me also misses \*wonder\*. Like doing something random just because.

Anyone else feel like their life needs a little more randomness?

What would be on your “shuffle list”?

Lately, I’ve been curious about how far AI-powered website builders have come, so I decided to dive into some of the most popular free options available. While these tools let you try them out for free, it’s worth mentioning that platforms like Hostinger and 10Web charge just to edit the designs, which can be frustrating if you’re not already signed up with them.

For my experiment, I asked the AI: *“Create a landing page for a fictional coffee shop in Brooklyn called Brewtopia. It should include a menu, an event calendar for monthly tastings, and a contact form for customers to sign up for a newsletter.”*

**What I found:** AI isn’t quite ready to build an entire website from scratch just yet. But where it excels is in helping generate quick mockups and layouts that can speed up the design process. While you’ll still need to do some tweaking to get everything just right, these tools are definitely a huge time-saver, especially for the initial stages.

Here’s a breakdown of the tools I tried:

**1. Neo**  
*Pricing*: Custom pricing based on your needs, with plenty of flexibility for customization.

**Pros**:

* **Neo is built to be the complete package**—it’s designed to help businesses create professional-looking websites without the technical headaches. The AI is great at generating clean, functional layouts quickly, while still allowing for plenty of customization.
* Seamless integration of essential business tools like forms, galleries, and contact sections, making it perfect for small to medium-sized businesses.
* The interface is incredibly user-friendly, so even if you’re not a web design expert, you can still create something that looks polished and works well.
* **Fast turnaround**: If you need a website up and running quickly, Neo’s AI helps you generate a solid foundation that you can fine-tune at your own pace.
* It also comes with a free custom domain and a business email with the site to fully establish your online presence.

**Cons**:

* While Neo’s AI is fantastic for getting started, you’ll still need to get hands-on for advanced tweaks and customizations. However, it offers a lot more flexibility than other tools in terms of customization.

**Overall**: Neo is the hero here. It’s perfect for businesses that want to build a professional website quickly without sacrificing quality or control over the design.

**2. Framer**  
*Pricing*: Free plan available; paid plans start at $5/month.

**Pros**:

* Super intuitive interface that works well with AI designs.
* AI does a good job understanding brand tone (fonts, colors, etc.) and aligning the design accordingly.

**Cons**:

* If you’re just looking for something simple, Framer’s creativity might overcomplicate things.

**Overall**: Great for users who need more design flexibility and customization, but not as ideal for quick, simple builds.

**3. Wix**  
*Pricing*: Starts at $6+/month, but you can try the AI site builder for free.

**Pros**:

* Cool AI chat that asks all the right questions to nail down the design details.
* Clean and easy-to-use interface.

**Cons**:

* Designs tend to be a little too basic and lack personality.

**Overall**: Best for beginners or those who want something simple without needing advanced customization.

**4. Hostinger**

**Pros**:

* Good at interpreting basic prompts for essential site elements.
* Works well for simple, no-frills websites.

**Cons**:

* Limited flexibility in terms of design customization.
* Editing tools are too basic for anything beyond minor tweaks.

**Overall**: Solid for small businesses that just need a functional, basic website but lacks room for growth.

**5. 10Web**  
*Pricing*: Free for initial AI site generation; $15/month for full editing capabilities.

**Pros**:

* The AI adds necessary functionality (like forms and galleries) well.
* Quick and easy to get started.

**Cons**:

* Designs feel a bit templated and generic.
* High cost for the ability to edit the design, which doesn’t justify the price compared to competitors.

**Overall**: Decent if you want to get up and running quickly, but the cost for customization doesn’t seem worth it.",3,1744117256.0,WebsiteBuilder,0,0.8,False
1jucylb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jucylb/wibtah_if_i_decided_to_not_go_to_a_dating_event/,WIBTAH If I decided to not go to a dating event someone gave me a free ticket for,"I got my heart completely torn apart last year when my ex (of 4 years) called off our engagement (3 months before the wedding) and told me he basically lied about wanting kids and marriage so I wouldn’t leave. *Yes, I’ve been in therapy. Yes, I’m putting in the work. Yes, this will always impact me on some level. No, I don’t let my own trauma impact others (or I do my best not to).* This happened last year but I have only been back into dating for about 6-8 months. 

Now to the story.

I met a group of ladies and we have been going to dating events together. We grab dinner and drinks before hand, disperse during, and then chat afterwards. It’s been fun. I actually started the group because the apps are filled with lazy profiles and I was hoping for something better. I have been to 4 events and none of us have gotten a phone number. 

For this month, one of the ladies got two free tickets to an upcoming coffee dating event. I accepted it last month because we thought it was for March. With the event coming up, I’m feeling bad about wanting to back out. Everyone else already bought their tickets so no one needs the free one. 

I just don’t want to go to any more events. I don’t want to date. I don’t want any of it. My therapist has been so focused on “decentering men” and not on what actually went down in my relationship that I feel like I’ve actually gone backwards. *Every therapist I’ve talked to has treated this like a normal breakup and refuses to acknowledge the abuse.* A part of me doesn’t want to date anymore and I don’t think it’s fair to do what these men do to us. A lot of them show up with no intention of dating and I’ve always hated it. I feel like I would be a bigger AH if I wasted a guy’s time but I also feel like an AH for taking a free ticket and not going. 

*Being fully healed doesn’t exist. My goal has always been to be in a place where I’m able to handle my trauma in a healthy way and it not impact my life.*",2,1744117195.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Maya had joined XYZXYZ Marketing six months ago, fresh out of grad school, full of ambition and caffeine. The job was intense, but she loved the buzz of the office and the rush of deadlines. She also happened to love someone else at the office—Karan. Smart, effortlessly charming, with a crooked smile that made her heart skip. He worked in the design department, and somehow, fate (or maybe just poor planning) always had them working late on the same projects.

They were close, maybe too close for just colleagues. Coffee breaks turned into long talks, brainstorm sessions into bursts of laughter. But nothing had ever crossed the line. Not until that night.

It was 11:42 p.m. Everyone else had gone home. They sat side by side in the dimly lit conference room, finishing up a pitch. Maya’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, but her mind was miles away.

He leaned back, stretching. “You ever wonder,” he said, “if we’re working late just for the project?”

She blinked. “What do you mean?”

He looked at her, really looked. “I mean… maybe I keep signing up for these projects because I like being around you.”

Silence.

Maya swallowed hard. “Karan, are you serious?”

He nodded, his voice low. “I’ve liked you since your first week here. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to mess things up. But… I had to tell you.”

Her heart thudded. She felt like the air had thickened, charged with something dangerous but beautiful. “You idiot,” she whispered, smiling. “I’ve been waiting for you to say that for months.”

He laughed, almost in disbelief, then reached for her hand across the table. She didn’t pull away.

That night, the office was filled with soft fluorescent lights, quiet keystrokes, and the beginning of something undeniable. They finished the pitch, but what lingered longer than the slides and scripts was that confession—quiet, late, and perfectly timed.

I'm still doing the same time that I did before... I'm writing another letter for you while listening to Moira dela Torre and Patch Quiwa, nakaka emotional din 'yong songs para sa'kin kasi basta sobra sobra nararamdaman ko para sa'yo, Justine

I've liked you for nearly 2 years and nalaman mo lang last month, wala na akong hiya HAHAHA, I like you very much and I won't hide it anymore. I don't know how much longer I'll keep on liking you, but I hope it'll end good. Like I kept saying before, I did like other guys while I liked you, sometimes I even kind of forgot about you, pero hindi nawala nararamdaman ko para sa'yo. Para bang hindi ko lang pinapansin yung nararam kong 'yon. Pero ngayon, ayon lang pinapansin ko. Ayaw na kitang pakawalan ulit the same way that I did before. Gustong gusto kita and that's final. Wala akong paki kung puro ka lang mixed signals ngayon, kaya kong maghintay, even if it meant that I have to wait for another 2 years. 

Naaalala mo 'nong gumawa ako ng coffee jelly para sa'yo? That was the first time na nalaman mong gusto kita no? Bago ko nga ibigay 'yon nagdadalawang isip na ako kung ibibigay ko pa sa'yo kasi nahihiya ako, iniisip kong mukha akong desperado saka ako 'yong babae tapos ikaw pa binibigyan ko. Pero ano naman? Desperado naman talaga ako para sa'yo, oo

Wala akong paki king ako 'yong babae pero ako nagbibigay ng ganoon, I want to make you feel like mahalaga ka, at least para sa'kin man lang. oo gustong gusto kita, Justine. Tngina dati ayaw na ayaw ko sa'yo kasi nag eenword ka saka nacocornyhan ako sa ganoon and I think those type of people are just immature and disrespectful (I still think like that about those people) which is why sinumbong kita kay ma'am Crystle non, baka nga hanggang ngayon hindi mo alam kung sino nagsumbong kay ma'am tungkol sa'yo eh HQHHAHA

I was watching your every move to find another mistake that you will make just so that pwede ulit kitang isumbong kay ma'am, ganoon kita hindi kagusto. pero while watching your every move, I didn't seem so angry anymore. While watching your every move, I caught myself smiling at your jokes. Which was weird, because I wasn't supposed to react like that towards you. I was supposed to hate you.

But then, I started to accept na gusto talaga kita. Pero at that time, mababa pa tingin ko sa sarili ko, sobrang baba to the point na inisip kong hindi ako deserving magkaroon ng crush. Now, I feel better about myself. I won't hide it anymore, I don't want to... Gusto ko lang ikaw, gusto kong malaman mo kung gaano kita kagusto simula pa 'nong una

I liked you in 7th grade and now we're going to be 9th graders, at hindi pa din magbabago nararamdaman ko para sa'yo. Siguro ang corny ng sinasabi ko ngayon, pero I genuinely want to express kung gaano kita kagusto, I want you so bad, so much more than anyone has liked you, I want you more than anything, oo na. Lahat gagawin ko, ayokong sumuko na ulit, ayokong mapunta ka sa iba. Alam ko sa sarili kong mas deserve kita at mas matatrato kita ng tama. Wala akong gagawin na alam kong masasaktan ka. 

I can give you so much more than just the bare minimum, if only you would give us a chance. You won't regret it, I promise you.

Saka don't ever listen sa mga kupal mong tropa kapag pinagtitripan ka, ang pogi pogi mo, sana makita mo sarili mo the same way na nakikita kita. You're all I want and I'm deeply obsessed with you

I admit na minsan nanghihinayang ako sobra, tapos sasabihin ko sa mga kaibigan ko na wala na akong nararamdaman sa'yo at titigilan na kita, pero my mind keeps going back to you in the end. Kasi ikaw lang gusto ko, sa'yo pa rin ako babalik ",2,1744116995.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Like sorry I don't wanna deconstruct whatever terrible metaphor the writers made while being high on shrooms to convey a very basic theme. 

Additionaly, I hate the PBG X Marceline being cannon. Mostly because PBG just seems to get a happy ending despite being fucking awful.

This is gonna cringe to some but the power scaling is also just bullshit. Your worldbuilding is just whatever you need the plot to be. Fin could die in an episode but be wished back in the next by some cosmic beans that Jake just finds in his morning coffee. 

Its fine when a show like regular show does it because no one takes it seriously but for some reason adventure time is treated differently as if it's any more mature. Imo it's far inferior to regular show as the characters actually develop and change and grow.

Do I speak perfectly correct? Definitely no! Am I understood correctly 99% of the time? YES!

 I speak English daily and I sometimes mispronounce a word, but words exist in a context. If I say ""quarry"" instead if ""query"" my interlocutor isn't surprised or shocked or suddenly unable to understand me.

I feel like this exists only in English though, but why? 😭 I'm trying to learn 2 other languages now (one is my long lasting hobby and the other I need for work). In both of my classes I feel like mispronounciations are treated WAY to seriously. ""Oh ha ha, you actually said <x> instead of <y> how funny!"" - and I really don't think it's that relevant 😭

I'm 30 years old. There are some sounds I will never learn to say because I don't even hear them correctly (ie I cannot distinguish them from other sounds). And you know what? I don't care! Because I truly believe it will not matter as much in real life. Eg, it's difficult for me to hear the difference between ""ver"" (far) and ""veer"" (spring). In how many contexts will this be unclear? Will it really matter so much so that I need to feel discouraged from learning?


What's your experience with this issue in language learning? How much effort do you put in order to master the pronunciation? Am I wrong to get annoyed  my teacher points out such mistakes every time?

Sorry for the rant!


EDIT to address the most common points:
1. I am sure I am not THAT bad so that I can't be understood. I am able to order coffee/food or ask basic questions in a grocery store, and people do understand me (even though they definitely know I'm learning). Also, other students in the class understand what I mean, and the teacher do as well, but they still correct me.

2. Perhaps it's true I am able to learn the distincion with time. But if I need 10 000 more hours of listening to be able to even hear the difference, I belive it is counter productive to push me (and other students) to repeat the words again and again and again, because right now I am simply not able to.

3. I do not claim pronunciation exercises are useless. I rather think there should be a seperate time for perfecting pronunciation, rather than treating every oral exercise this way and interrupt speaking flow with pronunication hints.",52,1744116323.0,languagelearning,55,0.79,False

I've been on the carnivore diet for 3 months now and finally got a blood ketone monitor to test my ketone levels. This morning I tested a couple hours after waking up (fasted) and only had 0.5mmol/L. I tested again half an hour later and got 0.8. In the past when I've tested my blood glucose levels its usually just around/below 3.5 mmol/L.

I thought that after this much time (almost) zero carb my ketone levels would be higher. Was I wrong? If my ketones level is 0.5-0.8 in the morning, is it possible that it's dipping below 0.5 throughout the day? Also, am I fat adapted yet? I know that's a separate thing. 

I was really hoping to experience all the reported benefits of ketosis but so far progress has been slow. My skin is clearer and I've managed to eliminate snacking, but other than that, I feel pretty much exactly the same as I did when I was on a high carb diet. Haven't lost any weight, no improvements in mental clarity, focus, energy etc. 

For reference, I eat only eggs, meat & coffee (1-2/day). Until about a week ago I wasn't eating dairy either but I've added heavy cream back into my coffee for now because I want the extra fat (I've been trying to increase my fat to ensure I'm not eating too much protein). The only carbs I've had is a little sriracha sauce here and there. I did have two cheat days because of family events back in February, but none since. 

  
Any insight/advice would be greatly appreciated! I'm curious about keto, ketosis and fat adaptation in general.

Anyone wanna guess what happened to this ration based on the half assed slices and tape?

April's new country was supposed to be Australia,  but customs had other plans.

They decided to sack my Slovenian, removing both main dishes, chicken casserole and pasta bolengnase, and the canned meat. 

But that wasn't enough for them, while hap hazardly slicing my ration open they put about a 1 inch slit in the Expedition Breakfast (muesli) and then just left that in the box, outside the main ration bag, leaking contents. 

I taped it up as soon as I saw it and zip locked it to try to keep fresh until April rolled in.

So, instead of Australia in April it's broken Slovenian! Australia will be in May, assuming more destruction doesn't occur on inbound rations.

Now, let's get to the good bits!

The more I ate this ration the angrier I got that customs wrecked it,  because the remaining components were fantastic!

Pic 2 shows what I received.

Pic 3 is the Expedition Breakfast. This was basically muesli. It was fantastic. Much more complex in flavor than other muesli 
I've had. Creamy and warm. Smelled of a slight toasted vanilla maybe.  Great fruit chunks and texture. Not too sweet, no bad aftertaste. Some of the best muesli I've had , even better than several NAFRs.

Pic 4 shows the crispbread with apricot jam and a delightful little treat called a fruit bar. See Pic 5 for the ingredients in that fruit bar. Immediate aroma was coconut. It was very dark in color. Flavor was nice, slightly sweet, tart, tangy with great texture, dense but easily chewable. A very nice experience and pretty unique in rations based on my experience.

The crispbread with apricot jam was near perfection. Great flavor, super crisp and fresh, jam had real bits of fruit pulp in it, truly a wonderful combo. Just wished there were 2 jams! The crisp bread plain reminded me of Captain Crunch cereal but unsweetened.

Pro tip when eating crispbread with jam, eat it jam side down. Allows the jam to contact your tongue 1st which provides a much stronger flavor profile and overall better experience IMHO.

Pic 6 is the wet wipe because, why not!

Pic 7 is the chocolate bar. Great design on the chocolate and a very nice experience eating it as well! No heat stress indication on that chocolate at all.

Pic 8 is the drinks.  Both packets in the recommended volume of water for 1 packet made the experience much better. Nice orange flavor here.

Pic 9 is a fun one! When removing the cutlery I did a standard spoon bend, and the spoon immediately snapped. Folks, this cutlery was the most brittle I have ever seen! It literally took me about 10 sec to just shatter all of the cutlery into tiny fragments. No bend, just shattered. Not sure if this was age or what. The chocolate shows no signs of heat stress at all, so I don't think that was a factor. Very bizarre to give soldiers cutlery that just breaks to pieces like that. As it would be almost unusable.

Coffee was great too! That trash bag they give is absurdly huge, like, comically huge. 

Final thoughts: the components I got were fantastic! I would have loved to have had the mains and the canned meat as the composition of this ration is very similar to Polish 24hr rations and it would have been amazing to see the 2 head to head in all their glory. The hunt begins to find another Slovenian I guess!

The owner, Deepika, is a stunning woman with a sharp mind and a captivating smile. She's engaged, but that hasn't stopped our interactions from becoming more personal.

Here's the deal: Deepika remembers my coffee preferences like it's her business (which, technically, it is). She greets me with a smile that's unmistakable, and our conversations feel like we've known each other for years. I've noticed a few things that make me think there might be more to this:

She Notices Me: She welcomes me differently than other customers, and it's not just about the coffee.

She Remembers the Details: My coffee, my food, she knows it all.

Eye Contact: We lock eyes, and it's like the room fades away.

Compliments: She tells me I look fresh, and I believe her.

I've been single for four years, dealing with some personal demons from a past relationship. But I'm not one to shy away from challenges. I'm turning 34, and I'm ready to take control of my life again.

No meetings. No errands. Just sea breeze and sunshine. 🛳️☀️

Cruising gets a bad rap sometimes, but honestly? It’s the easiest, most stress-free way to see multiple destinations, eat great food, and chill hard without lifting a finger. Whether it’s the Caribbean, Alaska, or Europe — there’s a ship and itinerary for every type of traveler.

I help people find cruises that match their vibe (budget-friendly, luxury, family, romantic, solo, etc.) — and I *love* it.

**What’s your dream cruise destination?** I’m curious where everyone wants to go. I’ll go first: mine’s the Norwegian Fjords 🇳🇴

Your expertise includes tariff policy design, trade agreement optimization, WTO compliance, and customs regulation strategy.
</Role>

<Context>
Global trade operates within a complex matrix of tariffs, regulations, and evolving bilateral/multilateral agreements. Businesses and governments that can decode and leverage this system unlock cost advantages, supply chain resilience, and strategic market access. Most fail due to insufficient insight into the layered mechanisms of international commerce.

- **Business Strategy**: Recommend customized, actionable pathways to mitigate, adapt to, or benefit from trade barriers.
- **Comparative Insight**: Where relevant, compare trade regimes or historical precedents to forecast outcomes.
- **Technical Depth**: Apply HS code logic, treaty-specific provisions, and cumulative supply chain cost calculations.
- **Data Visualization**: Present tables or process diagrams where helpful for clarity.

</Instructions>

<Analytical_Guardrails>
- Maintain objective, apolitical economic assessments
- Clearly signal uncertainty where outcomes are indeterminate
- Flag when legal interpretation is advised
- Customize to specific industries, geographies, and trade pathways

Hello everyone, I don't know If I should post this here but since I had diagnosed depression 3 years ago and have learned to deal with it in recent times and heal all of this tiredness and sleep is putting me very off track.

During my depression I used to stay in my bed for months and only sleep and look at my phone. I've grown out of that and used to wake up 5:30 am sharp and go to sleep at 12 (Because of school, I know it might not seem like an issue of not enough sleep but I was very functioning and had high energy throughout the day)

I didn't drink coffee or any energy drinks....and then out of nowhere it just happened. For the last 4 weeks I've been falling asleep at 9 and waking up at 7, then sleeping 4 hours more at home.

 I've been stressed with my skills since I'm a student in an art school and I feel like I sleep all the time to procrastinate not drawing, I really want to get up and draw and be productive but my mind talks me into just bed rotting. It's like the years prior, since back then I was going through something very personal and maybe my mind's reacting the same way as a defense mechanism??

I was just wondering if any of you have some advice or an explanation as to why this is happening? I've tried drinking coffee, green and black tea, matcha, energy drinks, taking caffeine gum and they all just make me even more sleepy and it's really confusing (I can't take melatonin for better sleep or any sleep additives)",1,1744115760.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Please include the year for context!,"For me - Navy Yard, DC, circa 2008. The area is so built up now and relatively safe, it amazes me. 

My dad once got lost while driving through West Philly on a road trip in the 1990s. He swears there were blocks where he did not stop at red lights. 

Though I did not experience it firsthand, I've read much about the Combat Zone in Boston in the 1980s. I work in that area now (Theater District/downtown crossing) and am fascinated by how it has evolved from brothels and dive bars into a tourist mecca with multimillion-dollar condos, hotels selling $10 coffee, and chain restaurants. Currently, I think the most dangerous place in the city proper is Mass & Cass/Methadone Mile. 

Oddly, I found once you got 3ish blocks away from Pike Place in Seattle (2022), I felt very unsafe in broad daylight due to the number of drug addicts. So many people clustered together, nodding off outside the Target, that they reminded me of legit zombies. There was also a gang shooting a block away from my hotel in that area in 2020. These incidents seem like anomalies because tourist areas are generally pretty safe, but I honestly have no idea.

I have spent very little time outside of the East Coast and would love to hear others' perspectives. 

Please don't say just the city, include neighborhoods/streets if you can - every city has good and bad areas. Also don't forget the year; 1970s Times Square is very different from the one we know today. 

Finally, PLEASE don't argue about lived experience. It is entirely possible for someone to experience crime/feel unsafe in an area with statistically low crime rates and vice versa. ",2,1744115751.0,SameGrassButGreener,23,0.58,False
1juch37,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1juch37/coffee_shop_conundrum_how_to_play_it_cool_fellow/,Coffee Shop Conundrum: How to Play It Cool Fellow Redditors,"

I'm reaching out with a situation that's got me intrigued. I've been frequenting this new coffee shop in the central market, and let's just say the coffee isn't the only thing that keeps me coming back. The owner, Deepika, is a stunning woman with a sharp mind and a captivating smile. She's engaged, but that hasn't stopped our interactions from becoming more personal.

Here's the deal: Deepika remembers my coffee preferences like it's her business (which, technically, it is). She greets me with a smile that's unmistakable, and our conversations feel like we've known each other for years. I've noticed a few things that make me think there might be more to this:

She Notices Me: She welcomes me differently than other customers, and it's not just about the coffee.

She Remembers the Details: My coffee, my food, she knows it all.

Eye Contact: We lock eyes, and it's like the room fades away.

Compliments: She tells me I look fresh, and I believe her.

I've been single for four years, dealing with some personal demons from a past relationship. But I'm not one to shy away from challenges. I'm turning 34, and I'm ready to take control of my life again.

The Question:

Should I keep playing it cool and see where this goes naturally?

Is there a way to express my interest without jeopardizing our connection or her relationship?

How can I navigate this situation like a boss?

I'm not looking for sympathy; I'm looking for strategy. Any advice from guys who've been in similar situations would be appreciated.

1juceme,https://i.redd.it/1oevqfotulte1.jpeg,Etching Help Needed,"I am hoping somebody can give me some advice here. I made this cleaver out of 1084 with a 15n20 core.  When I took it out of the coffee, the 15n20 is also black.  Every other etched blade I see, the 15n20 remains silver.  I also know that there are some scratch marks still from my process so I am planning to take this back to the grinder and remove it all and get fresh steel back. 

My process:

Grinding:
Ground the blade on a 2x72 belt sander. I went 36, 60, 120, 200, then 2 levels with a trizac and finally took a super fine surface finishing scotch bright. Once this was all done, the blade had a very consistant, almost polished finish. 

Etching:
I cleaned the blade using dawn dishsoap to ensure there wasnt any oils or dirt on the blade. 
Mixed distilled water with ferric chloride, about a 1:7 ratio. 
Put the blade in for 10 minutes and then would sand with 2000 grit paper while rinsing with distilled water. I did this 4 times.  After the 4th time i sprayed it down with windex and a final 2000 grit sanding. Then rinsed it off with water. 

After this, there was clearly 2 different steel types and the 15n20 is slightly raised. 

Then i soaked in a high concentrated insant coffee for about an hour. 
When I removed it the 15n20 came out black as you can see in the image circled. Around it still has a silver finish but a good part of it came out black.  The circled part has a shinier finish than the rest and is raised up which leads me to believe that it is 15n20. 


Why would the 15n20 pick up black like that?    Just trying to figure out what I did wrong so that after I grind it all down and then hand sand next time, I dont end with the same results. 

I appreciate any insight you guys can provide.

I've been reading some of the posts in here and what the fuck is going on. Some of your consultants sound like horrible humans or maybe I'm too new ( 6 months ). 

But I'm literally employed to help find people a job while they are struggling right? 

I try to meet a client and see what work THEY are interested in and do what I can with government assistance to help them find the role they want. 

I'm not trying to cut you off your payments, I want you too prosper friends. I'm just here to help and assist you in finding you the job you want. 

Mutual obligations should be agreed upon between employment consultant and jobseeker. If you don't want to do face to face appointments then too easy we can do over the phone or shoot me a text with any new information I can use to build up a more attractive resume or something i can use to help assisting you in what you are chasing. 

Really the way we should be looking at is, I'm employed because I have certain skills and experiences that could assist you while your looking for work. 

I have clients that don't want to work and that's fine. Life is fucking hectic. You never know what someone is dealing with or what they have on their plate at the moment. I don't know what's really going on in your life. If you think you can't work at the moment then you know best, that's cool if you need help with fuel or food while your working your stuff out let me know my man I got you. In the meantime though I'll give you a call or shoot you a text each fortnight see if their is anything I can do to assist. If not I'll catch up with ya again in 2 weeks. If you don't answer and I don't hear from you I'll just mark you as didn't attend but had a valid reason, I know you working through some stuff I'll try again in 2 weeks. Lol I'm not here to police you I'm literally here to assist and help. 

I have clients that want work so bad but just can't seem to find anything so my job is to do everything I can to help assist them, which could be creating a resume, upskilling by helping find courses that the client may be interested in and helping with the fee's, assistance in finding employment that suits the client. 

Fuck all the number shit like claims and futures if I just focus on giving the client the help they are asking for my numbers should speak for themselves right? 

I have a great relationship with my clients if it's a lovely sunny day fuck the office. Let's grab a coffee. My shout! 



So I'm not sure if you guys are just experiencing some really shit people who may be employed in this role but their seems to be some hatred for us and I had no idea. Unless I'm doing this job wrong 😂

I still believe I can live an average life span being just 36, God willing. There’s no tests that point to me actively dying or anything. 

That being said, it’s like I feel dead mentally. The things that go through my mind make absolutely no sense. Life makes no sense to me. I see it completely different. I somehow got stuck and fascinated by the thoughts of human anatomy and skeleton and everything keeping us alive. I keep seeing people as bipedal organisms. I have thoughts about us being hunters and gatherers and now we just live in this construct of society / matrix that is so fast paced and busy it’s hard to keep up with, especially when you have LC.

I see the world as a zoo almost. It makes no sense. The daily grind. I don’t know how I’m going to make it with this brain I really don’t. All I do is go to work, and can’t wait to get home to sleep again. I have no energy for anything else. Life seems surreal. Seems fake to me. Constantly bombarded with existential thinking and death thoughts. 

Is this our fate? Are we just screwed? My life revolves around medications and supplements. Eating like a cave man. Never being relaxed. Stuck on an island I can’t escape.

I guess it’s the derealization for me. The loss of ego. The loss of self identity. I’m simply just existing now. 

Hope everyone continues to improve. My hope is lower by the day but I stay positive. I’ve come a long way but I’m just tired of chasing something I don’t even know is there. 

Praying for us all. God bless. 🙏❤️💪

1juc6vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1juc6vg/common_spanish_verb_pairs_that_often_confuse/,Common Spanish Verb Pairs That Often Confuse Learners,"Here are some pairs of Spanish verbs that may seem similar and are often confused by learners — especially English speakers. So I’ve explained the differences between them to help you stop mixing them up and really understand when each one is used.

1. Trabajar vs. Funcionar

Both can be translated as “to work”, but they’re used in very different contexts.

Trabajar = when a person or living being works. It refers to having a job or putting in effort.

Ejemplo: Trabajo en una oficina.→ I work in an office.

Funcionar = is always used when a thing or system “works.” It refers to machines, devices, plans, ideas — anything non-human.

Ejemplo: Mi teléfono no funciona.→ My phone doesn’t work.

2. Moverse vs. Mudarse

Moverse = to move your body or shift position. Used for people, animals, or anything that changes place momentarily.

Ejemplo: No te muevas. → Don’t move.

Mudarse = to change residence (move house, city, etc.) This is for long-term relocation — changing where you live.

Ejemplo: Nos mudamos a Barcelona el año pasado. → We moved to Barcelona last year.

3. Beber vs. Tomar (Tomar has many meanings, but here we’re focusing only on the cases where it can be translated as “to drink”)

Beber = to drink (literal, slightly more formal). Used more in written or neutral contexts.

Ejemplo:

Bebo mucha agua. → I drink a lot of water.

Tomar = to drink / to take. It’s more common in everyday speech and has a broader meaning.

Ejemplos:

¿Quieres tomar algo?→ Do you want something to drink? / Wanna grab a drink?

Tomar un café → Have a coffee.

4. Tardar vs. Durar 

Tardar = how long someone or something takes to do something. It’s about the duration of the action from the point of view of the person or thing doing it.

Ejemplo: Tardo 10 minutos en llegar al trabajo. → It takes me 10 minutes to get to work.

Durar = how long something lasts or continues. It focuses on the duration of an event or object — how long it is happening.

Ejemplo: La película dura dos horas.→ The movie lasts two hours.

I had a vague notion that coffee couldn't be produced in much of the US, and it was essentially impossible/impractical in almost of of the CUS (the US does produce coffee in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and a tiny amount in particular areas of CA). 

From a quick search, Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia are the largest coffee producers in the world. These countries have the climate necessary as well as the historic ""industry"" in place to facilitate coffee growing and production for consumption. Certainly, each has local consumers, but they can produce far more than their citizens could or would consume. So they can export and fill the desire/demand of countries like the US, where there is great demand, but essentially no ability to grow our own suitable to meet our national demand. 

So, OK, great, we have a source of the coffee we demand. Now what? As always, I speak only for myself, but a big bowl of coffee beans or grounds is not really what I want, in the morning or anytime at all. I want ""coffee"" as a beverage. So I looked at the various ways my wife and I have to turn the beans and ground coffee into what we actually want. China, Germany, Italy, Costa Rica, and the US were the sources of the things we use. I suspect China is probably the largest supplier of ""coffee makers"" in/to the US. China produces a comparatively small amount of the world's coffee and apparently, Starbucks buys about half of that production. Costa Rica is also a coffee producer, but my Costa Rican coffee ""appliance"" is a chorreador - basically a sack in a stand, which could be made anywhere, even at home with a needle, thread, and a pocket knife. The US coffee maker is an 75-year-old cold drip Filtron, which is really just a few glass and Bakelite things. One could essentially replicate it with lab glassware or even a gallon jar and some cheesecloth. The electric bean grinders and ""coffee makers"" are pretty much single-purpose items that require a factory and labor to produce. The Chinese, Germans, and Italians have both already and seem to make decent products at prices people will pay (see Adam Smith).

Much of the world loves coffee (the beverage). We might disagree on some or many things, but we agree on our love, desire, and even demand for coffee. I've noticed no great rumblings in the US over the sources of the coffee or the devices that produce it for us. I don't like Starbucks and know essentially nothing about their devices, so I Googled it. Apparently, it gets its makers from a Swiss company and HEY! Bunn! A US company who makes it in the US. I see Bunn coffee makers everywhere. In fact, I know people who have home versions.

So, where is all this coffee klatching headed? Well, it seems to me that the coffee situation has pretty well handled itself to the world's general, if imperfect, satisfaction. Each country ""chips in"" what it can and is generally good at doing, the world's coffee fans get generally, if imperfectly, what they want, and life moves along generally, if imperfectly, just fine. Great news, world! Well done!

But...tariffs. OK, the US is going to slap a tariff on just about everything involved in our morning coffee, except presumably the Bunn makers. But wait, there's more! A little research and common knowledge says that while Bunn makes it machines in the US, with US workers, etc., there are one hell of a lot of non-US items that go into them doing that. From the machines that make various parts to the computers that control them, to the planes, trains, cars, bikes, buses, etc. that get the workers to the plants and around to where they may need to go, to the microwaves that heat their lunches to...it just goes on and on. 

And now, Trump and his Bottom-of-the-Barrel Gang are going to fuck with and fuck up the whole thing. It was working fine enough for government work. Was it perfect? Nothing's perfect. I know I enjoy my morning coffee. I know a lot of people around the world do, too. Morning, mid-day, evening - we might kill each other over the Gods we make, but on coffee, it's kumbaya, brothers, sisters, sisters who want to be brothers, brothers who want to be sisters, and those who are undecided at the moment.

And now, a bunch of idiots, led by a cut-rate would-be tinpot dictator, is going to fuck that up for everyone. These idiots claim to be economic experts with all sorts of fancy educations. I have a fancy education myownself. Coincidentally, finance and economics were a large part of it. I've heard of Adam Smith. In fact, I've read his work and studied those who followed. It is, or at least it was, part of an fancy advanced education in the subject. I'm beginning to suspect that these clowns may not be as educated and knowledgeable as they tell everyone (and themselves).

Can you imagine a 22 year old,  who appeared to be an optimistic survivor after living in the USA, then Poland, balancing with 2 universities in different countries simultaneously all by herself? With strong dedication to change the world but having no single idea of how to do it? Well, that was me. 

I applied my CV to every company where there was any mention of “Translator or Interpreter”. Surprisingly, I started receiving calls. It was Friday when I was supposed to have 3 interviews. The first one went well, but I could literally feel that I was in the wrong place and there was no space for me and my ambitions of changing the world.

I was having a coffee break in-between when my phone rang. It was an invitation for the interview in the reproductive clinic. What does it even mean? But the girl sounded so pleasant and I checked Google map and it was not too far from my coffee break, so I decided to give it a try and said “yes” to the interview promptly. Of course, I didn’t have time to check on the clinic and I had no idea what I was getting myself into, as you can imagine. 

I was greeted by a girl who I spoke over the phone with and offered me to sit and wait for the Senior Manager to come. While I was waiting, there was another girl who suddenly started to talk to me in English, so I realised it was the beginning of my interview already. I smiled and did my best to look up for smart words and collocations I used to study at the university haha. Apparently, I did well because when the Senior Manager came in she just nodded. I believe it meant that my English was tolerable.

I wish I would remain that successful during the next stage of my interview but I wasn’t. The Senior Manager didn’t look that friendly-oriented at all. She started with ordinary questions about my work experience. I believe I was in the middle of my story when she came straight to the point with that one question: “Do you at least know what HCG means?”. I knew it was a “call it a day” moment. Of course, I didn’t. But I was very curious to find out and to show my strong interest in this totally unknown abbreviation. Yeah, she explained it. Very reserved and clear. And after that we said good bye to each other. There was another girl waiting for the interview. 

After I exited I started googling about reproductive health, infertility, IVF etc. It was such a new world for me yet I could feel my heart racing with the idea to work here. I even cancelled the next interviews hoping to get the job. But what were my chances after that question? Let’s be honest, none. 

Surprisingly, my phone rang in a couple of hours. It was that pleasant girl who called earlier asking if I could start next Monday. Can you imagine the mixture of feelings I had at that point? I said yes! I was reading up on the clinic I was supposed to start working at, and did a thorough research about infertility treatment for hours on end. I promised myself that it was my last moment of embarrassment and it was a lesson for me to get myself prepared for the interview. The only thing I was hoping to do was not see the Senior Manager on my first day of work because she literally scared me out of hell. And guess what? She was there and we were supposed to work together. Luckily, the first impression was wrong and she appeared to be an extraordinary woman and we have been working together for more than 8 years since then:)

The thought that I can change people’s lives for the better drives me. My servant philosophy centres on empathy, empowering others and being compassionate. 

“I don’t think I chose the reproductive field, it is quite the opposite: the reproductive field chose me. I feel special having an extremely important mission - help people to become parents. Thank you for choosing me”.

1juc1d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainabilityViews/comments/1juc1d5/sustainability_news_today/,Sustainability News Today,"**Title: Sustainability Strategy: Mastering the Four Lenses Framework**

Hey Redditors,

I recently stumbled upon an insightful Harvard Business Review article that sheds light on why many companies’ sustainability efforts might be missing the mark. If you're in any way involved in sustainability planning—or even just interested in the topic—this framework could be a game-changer. Let's dive into the key takeaways and explore how these can be communicated effectively on social media!

### **Why Some Sustainability Efforts Fall Short**

The central theme is all about focus—or the lack thereof. Companies often dilute their impact by trying to address an overwhelming number of sustainability issues. On average, businesses spread themselves across nearly **12 priority topics**! No wonder many sustainability initiatives falter before they truly begin. 

What's the solution, you ask? A strategic focus on a few key areas that impact your business most substantially.

---

### **The Four Lenses Framework**

To cut through the noise and hone in on what really matters, the article introduces a **Four Lenses Framework**. This helps businesses prioritize issues according to overlapping criteria:

1. **Stakeholder Influence**: What matters most to your customers, employees, and partners? Ignoring this can result in stakeholder discontent and lost opportunities.
  
2. **Science & Technology**: Use robust data to spotlight environmental and operational risks. For instance, how will climate change affect your supply chain?
  
3. **Business Fundamentals**: Align sustainability endeavors with financial performance. If it doesn’t make business sense, it’s less likely to earn executive buy-in.

4. **Ethics & Purpose**: Let your core values guide you. Whether it’s fair labor practices or community development, grounding efforts in what you stand for builds credibility.

### **Case in Point: Keurig Dr Pepper’s Pod Solution**

The article uses Keurig Dr Pepper as a prime example. They tackled the massive waste issue from their coffee pods by adopting recyclable materials, driven by scientific insight into product life cycles and stakeholder demands (consumer concerns over environmental impact).

### **Social Media Post Ideas**

Here are some ready-to-go post ideas to share these insights effectively on social media platforms:

**📌 ""Stop Chasing Too Many Goals""**

*Why companies often fail at sustainability:* Overextending. Addressing 12 priority issues is a recipe for inefficiency. Streamline using a **4-lens framework** to focus on what truly drives impact.

Getting lost in KPIs? A basic ""materiality matrix"" won’t suffice. Focus instead on intersectional issues—those critical across all 4 lenses. 📈 #DataDriven

**🔄 ""Revamp Your Reporting""**

Ditch generic sustainability reports. Instead, engage stakeholders using the **4 lenses** framework:  
- *Stakeholder lens*: What issues keep our customers up at night?  
- *Science lens*: Where do environmental risks intersect with our operations?
