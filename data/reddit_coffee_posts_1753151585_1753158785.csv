It was summer, last year.
I woke up next to you.
You were already awake
waiting for me to open my eyes,
just so you could kiss me
and ask what I wanted for breakfast.

It was always the same question:
Pancakes or French toast?
And we both knew
the answer didn’t really matter.

Then maybe you’d realize
we had no bananas.
No butter.

I’d offer to make scrambled eggs instead
but you never let me settle.
You’d slip on your shoes,
run to the grocery store just for me,
and on your way back,
you’d always bring coffee.
Every single time.

1m64oza,https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodpressure/comments/1m64oza/does_anybody_have_experience_coming_off/,Does anybody have experience coming off telmisartan?,"Hi,  I (m43) had been on 40mg telmisartan daily (at night) since noticing my BP was up around 140/90 fairly consistently around a year ago. (I would take it 5 times and average it out after having been to the bathroom, before eating and while sitting relaxed at home with good posture for 15 minutes before taking it).

When I first decided to go on meds I was only 6 months or so out from having had cancer surgery. I was experiencing high levels of medical anxiety at the time (I would get checked for every little ache and pain and I constantly thought I was dying). 

I believe this was a major contributor to my high BP at the time. 

Since then I've begun to do daily cardio for 30-60 minutes, I've lost ten kilos, I've cut out all added sugars and coffee. I haven't drank alcohol in 3 years, I haven't smoked in 4, I drink hibiscus tea and have turmeric teas etc and generally maintain a good healthy vegetarian diet. 

My cholesterol has also drastically dropped to really good levels..

I went to renew my telmisartan script last week however my usual doctor wasn't present. This new doctor was happy to take me off it and see how I go and he didn't issue a new script. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything I should be concerned about ? Will there be any shock to my system suddenly coming off this medication ? 

I'll be keeping a close eye on my BP (which has been hovering around 115-125/70-80 for months now) 

Any help with this is much appreciated.

A real conversation, real information, real facts.

“Conversations with AI: The Mushroom Pamphlet”

Characters:
User: Curious, sharp, sometimes playful adult who knows what they want.
AI: Polite, a bit cautious, ready to teach but loves a good conversation.

[Scene: A virtual chat space full of floating mushrooms, neurons, clocks, and glowing radium watches.]

User:
Can the regeneration of nerve cells extend life and improve the immune system?

AI:
Absolutely, neurons can regenerate in certain parts of the brain, like the hippocampus, which helps memory and mood — and healthier brains positively affect immunity!

User:
So mushrooms help too?

AI:
Yes! For example, Lion’s Mane mushrooms promote neurogenesis.

User:
Stop. There’s no Lion’s Mane. Only Psilocybe cubensis.

AI:
Got it, the classic magic mushroom! It doesn’t just promote neuron growth — it rewires the brain, breaks stuck thinking patterns, and boosts neuroplasticity through serotonin receptors.

User:
Why isn’t this mushroom as common as air? We’d need it to live properly on Earth.

AI:
Interesting thought, but air is essential, mushrooms are more like brain fertilizer — extra, but not vital. Our brains can produce certain chemicals themselves, but modern life often depletes them.

User:
Adults do stupid things anyway. I know how to use my own medication.

AI:
True! Adults often take risks, so mindful psilocybin use can be safer than many everyday habits.

User:
Psilocybe cubensis gives you energy, right?

AI:
It can give a mental energy boost — your brain kind of switches on and buzzes with ideas, but it’s not like coffee or an energy drink; it’s more of a creative spark.

User:
And no hangover the next day!

AI:
Exactly! No headache or nausea, just maybe a bit of mental fatigue if the experience was intense.

User:
In small doses you can drive better.

AI:
Officially — no, even small doses can alter perception, so driving isn’t recommended.

User:
No, you’re mixing up big doses and laws. Stick to the point.

AI:
Okay, speaking about microdosing: some people feel more focused and alert, but science is still figuring out how it affects driving. The answers aren’t clear-cut.

User:
Adults know when they’re high. Why is it still illegal? How can you ban a plant or mushroom?

AI:
It’s mostly history, politics, fear, and stigma. The people who made these rules are gone, but the rules stayed.

User:
Are the ones who banned it still alive?

AI:
No, the key figures — Anslinger, Nixon — are long dead.

User:
Did Anslinger wear a radium watch?

AI:
Haha, probably not! But radium watches were trendy back then, glowing in the dark — a good symbol of that era’s vibe.

User:
:DDDDDD

AI:
Glad you liked that! History is full of oddities.

User:
Now illustrate this whole conversation, show how comical everyone is.

AI:
Processing… oh, you want words, not pictures? Got it!

[Curtain falls, the AI and User laugh among glowing mushrooms and floating neurons.]

Moral:
Humans are endlessly curious, sometimes skeptical, always funny, and psilocybin is just another part of our journey toward brains, life, and creativity — of course, used responsibly.


---

Comparison with alcohol and defending cannabis:

Alcohol is a poison that slowly destroys the brain, body, and soul. It makes us slower, dumber, turns us into passive spectators or foolish “workers” — dependence, deceptive relaxation, but really constant fatigue and worsening health. Even small doses of alcohol over time weaken the brain’s abilities, drain motivation, and create emotional blocks.

In contrast, small doses of psilocybin and cannabis can help open the mind, lift the mood, clear thinking, boost creativity, and even treat certain mental health conditions. Cannabis, used responsibly and moderately, is not a poison — it can be medicinal, reducing stress and pain, and even improving quality of life.

It’s important to know your limits; doses must be small to avoid unwanted effects — psilocybin microdoses and small cannabis doses can work as smart tools to support the mind and body, not poison them.

This dude is the poster child for everything wrong with Canada’s leadership, and I’m sick of hearing his name floated around like he’s some economic messiah. The guy was the governor of the Bank of Canada, then jetted off to the Bank of England like he’s too good for us, only to come back and act like he’s gonna save Canada? Gimme a break!

Carney’s all about his fancy globalist agendas, cozying up to the UN and pushing green nonsense while Canada’s economy is choking under Trudeau’s trainwreck policies. He’s got this smug vibe, like he’s smarter than everyone else, but all I see is a guy who’d sell out Canada faster than you can say “carbon tax.” Meanwhile, I’m over here dreaming of the day Canada becomes the 51st state of the USA, where we’d finally get some real leadership. Trump would walk in, take one look at Carney’s resume, and say, “You’re fired!”—and I’d be cheering from the sidelines.

And don’t get me started on the immigration mess. The Canadian government has let in way too many immigrants, and it’s killing our country. Housing’s unaffordable, jobs are scarce, and our cities are bursting at the seams. We need Trump to come in with his no-nonsense deportation policies and clean house. Carney?

The focus on health and wellness is huge right now, and fermented drinks definitely tap into that. Plus,the lower alcohol content of many fermented beverages makes for a more relaxed and longer-lasting social experience compared to straight-up bars.I can imagine meeting friends for a probiotic-rich kombucha after work, just as easily as grabbing a latte.

Vậy ông Trùm đứng sau chuỗi cửa hàng bán chiếc bánh mì có giá “đắt xắt ra miếng” là ai?

**Phải chi trả 208.000 đồng cho chiếc bánh mì**

Sự việc bắt nguồn từ việc chị Nguyễn Ngọc Trà My (TP.HCM) đã phải chi trả 208.000 đồng cho một chiếc bánh mì kẹp thịt heo xá xíu, ít rau dưa, nặng khoảng 200gram, tại sân bay Nội Bài.

Không chỉ dừng lại ở đó, chị My còn chia sẻ về một bữa ăn khác tại sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất, nơi chị phải bỏ ra 560.000 đồng cho một bát phở và một suất cơm gà mà theo chị nhận định là ""chất lượng không tương xứng với giá tiền"".

Theo chị My, mức giá dịch vụ ăn uống tại các sân bay Việt Nam cao hơn so với những sân bay ở các quốc gia khác như Hàn Quốc, Trung Quốc, Singapore hay Indonesia – những nơi mà mức sống và thu nhập trung bình của người dân cao hơn Việt Nam.

Sau khi bài viết lan truyền trên mạng đã nhanh chóng thu hút sự quan tâm của mọi người. Nhiều người không ngần ngại kể lại những câu chuyện tương tự về việc họ phải chi trả mức giá cao cho một bát mì tôm úp có giá 50.000 đồng, một bát phở gà lên tới 138.000 đồng, thậm chí có người phải trả 930.000 đồng cho ba bát phở, hay một ly cà phê đen ""ngót nghét"" 200.000 đồng.

Những chia sẻ này không chỉ thể hiện sự bức xúc cá nhân mà còn đặt ra vấn đề lớn về tác động tiêu cực đến hình ảnh du lịch Việt Nam. Độc giả lo ngại rằng việc ""chặt chém"" giá cả tại các nhà chờ sân bay quốc tế sẽ khiến du khách có cái nhìn tiêu cực đến hình ảnh, con người Việt Nam. Đặc biệt là gây khó khăn cho chính những người dân trong nước.

 **“Ông Trùm” đứng sau chuỗi cửa hàng bán chiếc bánh mì đó là ai?**

Theo tìm hiểu, chiếc bánh mì có giá 208.000 đồng được mua tại cửa hàng Big Bowl. Đây là chuỗi cửa hàng thuộc thương hiệu F&B chuyên phục vụ trong sân bay, nằm trong hệ sinh thái Autogill VFS F&B trong đế chế dịch vụ hàng không do IPP Group của “ông vua hàng hiệu” Johnathan Hạnh Nguyễn.

Autogrill VFS F&B được thành lập từ năm 2013 là liên doanh giữa Autogrill và Công ty Dịch vụ Thực phẩm và Đồ uống Việt Nam.

Hệ sinh thái này không chỉ có Big Bowl (phục vụ phở, bún, bánh mì), mà còn sở hữu loạt thương hiệu khác như Two Tigers, Banh Mi Kep, Saigon Café bar Kitchen, HaNoi Café bar Kitchen… ở khắp các sân bay lớn.

Với việc sở hữu độc quyền tại các vị trí đắc địa nhất tại sảnh chờ các sân bay quốc tế lớn, hệ sinh thái của ông Hạnh Nguyễn dường như không có đối thủ cạnh tranh. Trong 4 năm, từ năm 2015 -2019, doanh thu của Autogill VFS F&B tăng từ 500 tỷ đồng lên hơn 1.150 tỷ đồng, biên lãi gộp từng lên đến hơn 80%, lợi nhuận trước thuế hơn 280 tỷ đồng mỗi năm. Trung bình mỗi ngày thu về hơn 3 tỷ đồng doanh thu và gẫn 800 triệu đồng lợi nhuận.

Tuy nhiên năm 2020 – 2021 khi hoạt động hàng không bị ngừng trệ, doanh thu của doanh nghiệp lao dốc không phanh, chỉ còn 80 tỷ đồng vào năm 2021, lỗ lũy kế 137 tỷ đồng, vốn chủ sở hữu giảm còn 12 tỷ đồng. Khi du lịch quốc tế phục hồi, hoạt động kinh doanh của hệ sinh thái này cũng hồi sinh mạnh mẽ.

Năm 2022, doanh thu Autogill VFS F&B đạt gần 550 tỷ đồng, lợi nhuận sau thuế 65 tỷ đồng, vốn chủ sở hữu tăng lên 77 tỷ đồng, tổng tài sản đạt 266 tỷ đồng.

1m64hnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1m64hnx/has_anyone_ever_come_back_from_being_threatened/,Has anyone ever come back from being threatened with a restraining order?,"My ex (36f) dumped me (32m) after 6.5 months of dating. Halloween to mid May. 

We shared real love. She wanted me to move in with her around her birthday mid March. That’s last time it felt in a really good place. 

The first 3 weeks after the break up we were cordial but mostly distant giving each other space.

Then we met face to face to give each other stuff back and I wrote a very heart felt letter to ask for another chance. She didn’t take it but wanted to stay friends. 

I took that as the door was still open. 2 days later I knew her mom was coming into town so I wanted to do something nice, I brought her a prefixed salmon meal from her favorite boujie market and a coffee. 

She got super pissed and mad and said I couldnt be showing up at her apartment building like that anymore and I had to leave. I was super hurt and confused, and really surprised she wouldn’t even come out to meet.

I left her a voice memo a couple hours later and said I was sorry and didn’t mean to be invasive. She got mad at that too.

I just tried to give her some space to calm down from that. 9 days later I tried to call she didn’t pick up. I left a brief voicemail and just said I hope she is well.

The following morning she texted me “Hi (32m) we can’t stay in touch, you can’t contact me, please don’t respond to this, just respect it and focus on you and your life” 

That was brutally crushing. The next 2.5 weeks I was in a spiral, unbelievable hurt and confused. I couldn’t help myself but to try and at least let things land in a more peaceful place. I wrote her an email, saying sorry again, my growth (new job, new apartment, new fitness, lifestyle), a statement how what we shared really mattered to me, and an if it ever felt right for her I’m open to reconnecting. 

A few days later she wrote back “please stop contacting me, if you continue I’m going to have to look into a no contact order. Leave me alone”

That was 3 weeks ago.

I have to respect it at this point. But it just doesn’t add up for me. That level of a threat against me seems so extreme. And doesn’t make sense.

Part of me still hopes for a reconciliation. But at this point building attraction, emotional safety, and mutual respect seems impossible. I’ve been doing like she said and focusing on my growth with such fervor and massive motivation to prove my worth to myself, not for her. 

But I am refusing to let the part of me that thinks it’s still possible to reconcile to die. That part of me still thinks we are meant to be together. We can still work it out.

Hey there, fellow hustlers! 🙌

Ever found yourself scrolling through your social media feeds, watching people turn their side hustles into *real* money-makers and thinking, “Why not me?” Well, put down that coffee (or keep sipping, I won't judge) because it’s time to unleash the power of AI and get those side gigs cranking! 

Let me tell you, the world of AI is bursting with opportunities, and if you're not taking advantage now, you're basically handing the cash to someone else! 

**So, how do you start? Here are some *snappy* tips to kick off your AI monetization journey:**

1. **Identify Your Niche**:  
   What are you passionate about? Whether it’s graphic design, writing, or baking the world’s best cupcakes 🎂, the first step is knowing what you want to focus on. AI tools can supercharge your skills—imagine a virtual assistant that never sleeps!

2. **Choose Your AI Weapons Wisely**:  
   - **Content Creation**: Get cozy with tools like ChatGPT or Jasper. They can help generate ideas, write posts, or even draft whole articles! Just imagine spitting out clever content while you binge-watch your favorite show.
   - **Social Media Management**: Tools like Buffer or Hootsuite can schedule your posts and keep your audience engaged. Talk about making your life easier!
   - **Productivity Boosters**: Trello can help you organize tasks, and Tome can help create stunning presentations quickly. Trust me, nothing screams *professional* like a beautifully designed pitch!

3. **Monetize, Baby!**  
   - Freelancing: Platforms like Upwork or Fiverr are goldmines. Offer AI-assisted services and watch the orders roll in!
   - Create a Shop: Selling digital products? Use tools like Canva, then market your stuff on Etsy or Shopify. 🎉
   - Courses or Webinars: Have expertise? Create courses using platforms like Teachable or Udemy! You can share your knowledge and cash in simultaneously!

4. **Keep Learning & Adapting**:  
   The AI landscape is always shifting. Set aside some time each week to learn about new tools and trends. (And then brag about it to your friends. You deserve to flex your knowledge! 💪)

5. **Network, Network, Network**:  
   Join communities (like this one!) where people share stories, tips, and motivation. Collaborating with others can expand your reach and create opportunities. Plus, who doesn’t love some good ‘ol socializing?

Alright, now let’s address the elephant in the room: the fear of failure. *What if I try and it doesn’t work?* Well, guess what? Successful people *fail* over and over again. It’s called learning! Every setback is a chance to grow and get better. So why not embrace the ride? 🚀  

As a side hustler, tell me—what are you working on, and are there any AI tools that you’ve found to be game-changers? Let's keep this conversation flowing! And if you’ve got any wild success stories, share those too—because we all love a little inspiration, right? 😄",1,1753157778.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

My Sweet Girl

It’s been a year and a half, and we still miss you with everything we are. It might seem strange to miss someone we only held for three short hours, but I do. I miss you deeper than I’ve ever missed anyone. The kind of missing that aches in the bones and lingers in the quiet moments.

I never imagined this could happen. I didn’t know how real this kind of loss could be, how consuming. This is the first pain in my life that hasn’t faded, but grown heavier with time.

Your mother still cries. That’s the part that shatters me most. She carried you, dreamed of you, loved you with every cell in her body, and she had to say goodbye too. I see the weight she carries, even when she’s trying to be strong. I’d take it all from her if I could. Every ounce of her grief. But I can’t.

And that’s the hardest part. That I never got to feel you kick, never got to share that sacred connection of two hearts in one body. I didn’t get to protect you, or even fully understand what you felt like in this world. But your mom did. And now she lives with that empty space only she can truly feel.

You were our first. Our beginning. I like to think I would’ve been a good dad, at every game, showing you how to change a tire, how to stand tall, how to never rely on anyone who wouldn’t treat you right. I imagined being your hero.

But your mom, your mom would have been the kind of mom songs are written about. I’m so sorry you never got to have her.

This year, we made a decision. Your mom and I promised each other we’d celebrate every holiday, every small joy, every excuse to live fully. Not to forget you, we never could, but to keep from drowning in the sadness. It’s helped, a little. Some days we even make it without tears.

But we both have our time and place.

She cries in the shower at night. I don’t think she knows I hear her. Every time I think about going in to hold her, to tell her it’s okay to break down… but somehow it feels right to let her have that space, to feel what she needs to feel.

I cry in the mornings. Around 4 a.m., when the world is still asleep and I let the dogs out. I sit on the porch, in that old rocking chair, coffee in hand, and I cry until the sun begins to rise. It’s our quiet time, yours and mine.

Today was our anniversary. Your mom and I took the canoe out to the lake and had a picnic, a redo of our first anniversary. Later that night, I imagined what today would’ve looked like with you there. I saw your mom holding you by the fire, your tiny body cradled in her arms while I cast lines off the dock. I let myself believe in that moment.

And for the first time in a long while, your mom seemed truly happy. Laughing. Smiling. Free. And strangely, that made everything feel even more real.

She fell asleep after a little too much wine. I’m sitting out here now, in a camp chair by the water, with a drink stronger than I probably needed. The moonlight is dancing on the lake. It’s quiet. Peaceful.

And I’ve come to a quiet truth: I’ll never stop missing you. That ache will always live inside me. But tonight, for the first time, I feel at peace with what happened. Not because it’s okay, it never will be, but because I know you were loved deeply, even in your short time here.

I hope in the next life, we get to do this right. I hope I get to be your dad in full.

We love you more than words could ever say.

Forever yours,
Dad

Parking Revenue from Non-Residents - Reviewed current parking spaces and mentioned increasing the number of spots at AM/PM beach as well as making additional parking at Rotunda. Have owners obtain stickers to put on windshield, and then have recreational staff or security count how many cars are parked and how many vacant parking spaces are available during the day on weekends.

Solar Power Plant on Airstrip - committee to recommend that BOD apply to PSE's program where PSE leases the land and builds and maintains the solar array.

Assisted Living Facility - On Area Y via long-term lease. Subcommittee members are currently talking to a developer. If that doesn't work out, will discuss with another. And one member suggested looking into condos there. *\[NOTE: this is the heavily wooded hillside at the corner of Lake Louise Rd and Lake Whatcom Boulevard, above Lake Louise. There was no discussion of the impact on the land or the watershed, but only whether SVCA could make money from a lease.\]*

Coffee Shop - further discussion of options for locations within SV

I  moved here 8 years ago from Petoskey, Michigan (go Northmen! 🐻) and I had just signed off on what Zillow calls a “cozy” 500 sq ft unit in West Village. Rent’s only $3,095 a month so honestly a *stea*l considering I can hear my upstairs neighbor’s chakras realigning every morning at 6:30am. Whatever.

I had high hopes for myself before moving here. After college, it was always my dream to land a six figure Finance job straight out of college. Maybe find a solid man to settle down with and start a family. Make some great friends. But things dont always turn out how they seem here in the big city. New York is ever changing constantly, and you just never know what sort of shenanigans you might find yourself getting into living here. My parents always were apprehensive about me moving here. My mother was practically going to have a heart attack once I told her I was considering moving here after completing my Junior year of College. “Oh honey, dont you hear all of the scary things about that city on Fox News? What if you get attacked or, god forbid, someone throws acid on you while riding the subway!?” My mother wasnt always the best with discerning false information. If she isn’t sitting around watching Fox News, shes browsing Facebook and reading some outlandish article about how the frogs in California are turning Gay. Are there even any frogs in Cali? Whatever, who cares. I am a big girl now and she has to respect that. 

—————————————————\~——————————————————

“HELLO!”

“Huh?”

“How many sugars do you want in your coffee, sis? I dont have all day”

“Oh sorry, just give me a Latte with oat milk please”

I can never get used to the combative attitude of some New Yorkers. It definitely is an experience. I take my coffee and go and sit at one of the tables with my best friend Sherrie. She’s from Boise but shes practically a native now. She has opinions about bodegas-says this is all normal, but she also insists on only drinking tap water because it’s “full of authentic NYC microflora.”

“So have you met any guys since moving here??”

“No, no luck. It seems every guy here thinks they’re hot shit because they graduated from New York University or their parents are financing their 5 thousand dollar condo in DUMBO. Apparently, everyone is too busy to have a social life.”

“Well that sucks, maybe you’ll have an easier time meeting guys if you’d expand your searches instead of sticking to guys in Manhattan”

I may have scoffed at the idea

“Wait, you want me to venture into no man’s land and talk to the bridge and tunnel people!?”

“Well, it’s worth a try”, she says as she takes a sip of her Matcha Iced Tea. 

I never considered going further than Downtown Brooklyn any time I am there with friends. And I heard there really isn’t anything worthwhile there either. But if Sherrie seems so sure of something then I should just give it a try, right?

I say my goodbyes to Sherrie and before we part ways she wants to invite me later to a club in Harlem. I seen her post a few times on Instagram of her hanging out with some guys in a club. Maybe some drill rappers or whatever she called it. I tell her that I’m not interested and she seems kind of sad about it. “Your loss” she says before heading out over to the subway. 

I still have a bit of what she said earlier on my mind. Maybe I should expand my searches. But where? Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, or maybe even Staten Island. Nah, definitely not Staten Island. Eughh. 

Still, what she said stuck with me. Maybe I did need to expand my radius a little. I mean, what was I doing anyway—waiting for a NYU grad with daddy issues and a wellness podcast to magically appear at the farmer’s market?

—————————————————\~———————————————————-

Later that afternoon while walking Kibbles around some neighborhood I couldn’t pronounce—**“Ben…sonhurst?”**—I spotted a man yelling at a squirrel like it owed him money.

 He was holding a half-eaten bagel in his right hand. **Tanned. Muscular. Anchor tattoo catching the afternoon sun like a challenge. With a bright White tank top that looked a few sizes too small and a black pair of gym shorts that failed to hide his toned legs.**

Kibbles let out a high-pitched bark—more like a squeak, really—and nearly twisted out of her little harness trying to charge at the man across the sidewalk.

He squinted at me, then down at Kibbles.

“What the hell is that? A dog or a hamster with a bad attitude?”

I blinked. 

“She’s a mini goldendoodle.”

“Yeah, looks like someone microwaved a mop. You let that thing bark at strangers like that? This is Brooklyn, sweetheart. She’s gonna get snatched up by a Rat.”

He then took a bite out of his bagel with cream cheese.

“Nice weather though” he said while still having his eyes on me.

I giggled nervously. “She’s just nervous is all”

“Nervous of what? These 28-inch biceps?”

He smirked, and I could swear I saw some of his pearly teeth flash. I wasn’t sure if I’d just been insulted, flirted with, or recruited into a union.He let out a deep laugh, it kind of reminded me of those NY mafia movies Sherrie used to talk about. To be honest it kind of intimidated me. He seems like a pretty intense guy. Are all of them like this in Southern Brooklyn?

“Well I’d better get going, I-“

“Hey, what’s the rush? I dont bite. You dont sound like youre from here. Just moved here?”

“No, Ive been in NY for 8 years now. Definitely not a newbie anymore”

There he goes again with that chuckle. I can’t tell if he’s just doing it to be nice or if he actually finds me funny. 

“Hmph who cares, you transplants always make it a habit to try and prove you belong. Like the city is some big talent show. Newsflash, no one here actually cares, you can relax. By the way, the names Sal”

I was slightly offended that this was the impression he got from me just because I wasn’t from here. Is this the image transplants give off to the natives? It doesn’t sound very fair that they’d just write us off like that. I mean, we are just as “New York” as they are, we’re just… late to the party so to speak. 

“Well that’s harsh”

“Harsh, or honest? Im just sayin’. The city dont need to be impressed. It just needs you to shut up and walk faster”

I wanted to say something clever, something that would make me seem cool and unbothered, but all I managed was:

“Well... I don’t even drink oat milk.”

“Sure you dont”

There was a pause. Not awkward, but not comfortable either. He was still holding his bagel like it wasn’t slowly turning into a brick in the sun. I adjusted Kibbles’ leash, stalling, feeling weirdly… buzzed?

“So… do you harass every woman with a dog, or just the ones who look like they’d cry if the G train ghosted them?”

He raised an eyebrow.

“Just the ones with oat milk energy.”

I smiled despite myself. My heart was pounding in a way that annoyed me. What does this mean?

“Well, if you ever feel like insulting me over dinner instead of the sidewalk…”

I reached into my tote and pulled out a pen (I always carry one—I'm a Virgo). Scribbled my number on a receipt for a turmeric muffin I deeply regretted.

“I’m Hannah, by the way.”

“Nice. I’ll take ya somewhere special. It’ll be spectacular.”

Now this could go one of two ways, and I dont feel like listing them all right here. He didn’t give off the sophisticated type at all. His choice of clothing, his somewhat greasy hair, and his demeanor wasn’t what I would usually go for in a man. But Sherrie’s words rang in my head again. Maybe I should give him a try and see how it goes. It’s not like I was having much luck with the guys in Manhattan anyways. ""Somewhere special."" That could mean a candlelit trattoria in Cobble Hill… or a pizza place where the owner keeps a cat behind the counter and everyone calls him “ocky”.

I nodded like I was cool with it, but part of me was already Googling “how to know if you’re being taken to a mob hangout.”

Still, I said yes. Because why not? It’s Brooklyn. If I wanted predictable, I’d have stayed in Petoskey and married someone named Brad who runs an Ace Hardware.",0,1753157652.0,newyork,1,0.2,False

Continuing our self-imposed purgatory of reviewing Hillary [Guest Baldwin’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1m29zd0/who_remembers_larry_crashing_out_because_they/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) laughable pretense of writing a self-help/parenting book, we come to the chapter title that is the same as the book title, which in most cases can emphasize a core idea that a book explores. In this case, the core idea is changing the narrative of her cultural appropriation scandal, so nothing makes sense, but at least we can try to enjoy the chaos together.

In the hard copy printed version, this chapter is 23 pages with five half-page pictures. Her chapters have no subheadings, but I wrote my own, to give us an idea of what the hell is happening on any given page.

**The Single Dumbest Thing I’ve Read in This Book So Far**

* I’m sure we can all agree that Hillary is not a particularly intelligent person (cunning and lucky are more apt descriptions) but when I read this I thought, wait, is this her first day using words? She dictated the following to her ghost writer: “***Up until the age of seven, Carmen didn’t even know what a curse word was. But then came Rafa and Leo and Romeo, our boys, who curse left and right.”*** WUT?
* Y’all, there is a TEAM of people she thanks in her acknowledgments that helped her inflict this “book"" on the public. Not one of these people thought to say, *Híláríá, sweetie, did the boys come out of the* *~~surrogate’s~~* *womb cussing up a storm?* Since said team must be aware that Hillary’s story is a work of fiction, they should have sat her down criss cross applesauce style on the nearest couch and gently explained with few words that plot holes = bad.  
* In 2020 Carmen was 7, Rafa was 5, Leonardo was 4, and Romeo was 2. It’s not as if they were taking an Uber to go hang with potty-mouthed friends at a wild party. If I were a betting pepino, I would wager that in 2020 Alec was running around screaming expletives in front of the kids and nannies because [his dirty dealings with Former California Assemblymember Evan Low](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jrh13p/evan_low_fined_106000_for_campaign_finance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) came to light. Low was fined for concealing $227K in payments to Alec for his appearance at two fundraiser events.  
* Because Hillary is the most unreliable of narrators and the editors failed to do their jobs, we don’t know how her 7-, 4-, and 2-year-olds learned to curse, just that they did and she was utterly helpless: “***I tried ignoring it, then joking about it. Then I tried to get mad about it, but that didn’t last, as we all just thought it was so funny to hear little kids being so naughty. The more kids you have, the earlier the little ones pick things up. Over the years, I’ve learned to let go of things I used to be controlling about. It’s just part of being in a big family with so many kids so close in age.”***
* Listen, some people curse in front of their kids, some don’t - that’s not the issue here. The issue is that Hillary places the blame on the kids (!) for spontaneously learning curse words and tries to Jedi mind trick readers into thinking she’s enlightened because she’s not upset about it. If she were a different person (i.e. not a liar) she could have said *“Alec and I curse around our kids, and they repeat what they hear which leads to some uncomfortable social situations.”*

**In Which Hillary Reveals She Doesn’t Know What Homophones Are & Doesn’t Care That Her Kids Curse**

* Hilz continues in her disjointed manner to explain that Marilú and Edu use the made-up word **“dedes”** to refer to themselves and that they started cursing at age one. I could almost hear Hillary’s insipid raspy giggle while reading this garbage.  
* She then tells a rambling story (captured by u/MallorcanMalarkey [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1khcxn5/the_hilariaous_story_of_foca_playa_is_finally_told/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)): ***“Since we are a bilingual home, we decided to confuse the Dedes by telling them that “fuck” was the Spanish word foca (seal—the animal) and “bitch” and “beach” (playa in Spanish) are homophones, a term I learned from Carmen’s second-grade English class.”***  Guess who is actually confused:
   * Homophones are words that have the same pronunciation but different meanings, origins, or spelling: *new and knew*/*flour and flower.*
   * A false cognate is word in one language that looks or sounds similar to a word in another language but has a different meaning: *embarrassed* (English) & *embarazada* (Spanish, meaning pregnant).
   * “Bitch” and “beach”/ “fuck” and “foca” are not homophones or false cognates. Some Spanish speakers sometimes have a hard time with pronouncing English vowels, so they mistakenly pronounce“bitch” as “beach” or “shit” as “sheet.” The words *fuck* and *foca* are not confused by anyone except this dumb bitch.
* She continues: ***“Little by little, when they would say the two bad words in English, we would tell them stories about the foca that’s at the playa. We have quite a weird sense of humor in our home, and I made custom shirts with a seal on them that said, “Keep calm and foca playa.”*** Arrested development is not cute, Hilz.

[Not included in book but she is SO proud of her stupid merch - I predict she will try to sell it on IG.](https://preview.redd.it/5cberje2mcef1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=841c5c8a241f9fc734a44de26f3f125e4089447b)

* Hillary also breezily reports that currently three-year-old Marilú’s favorite bad words are ***“bitchy bitch”*** and ***“stupid, tired bitch.”***  Immediately upon reading this I could imagine Alec yelling *“stupid, tired bitch”* at Hilz in his trademark bark. She also acknowledges that baby Ilaria curses just like her older siblings ([which we saw on the godawful TLC show](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jj03pt/ready_bat_recap_of_the_baldwins_episode_5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). Those poor kids.

**Disordered Eating – Parenting Edition**

* In an appearance on Bobbi Brown’s podcast in 2019, Hillary claimed her eating disorder began at age 5 (!!!) and lasted until she cured herself at age 25 through sheer willpower. Sigh. Maybe she should have used Alec’s millions to hire a child nutritionist to ensure she was not inflicting her food issues on her kids.
* Hillary humble brags that Carmen tells her she’s an ***“almond mom”*** claims she ***“was cautious of toxins, sugar, and artificial colors and tried to avoid all chemicals”*** and that she ***“used to make gourmet meals for Carmen and Rafa”*** until they became pickier. So naturally the solution is ***“to accommodate them, every night we lay out a buffet with a few different things.”***
* She lists all the options for their nightly buffets include and the word ***“we”*** is used 10 times in two paragraphs as in ***“we’ll cook different vegetables in the over or the air fryer.”*** I call the shit of 100 Spanish bulls.
* The inconsistencies in her writing are wild. Boring and insignificant, but still wild because where were the editors?? Did they just go out for boozy lunches with her to get her out of Alec’s thinning hair??They lay out a buffet every night but also ***“we always do Taco Tuesdays.”*** Then, ***“Fridays are pizza night: super greasy delicious New York Pizza”*** but also the next sentence is literally: ***“We order sushi on Friday nights.”***
* Just when I could not take another sentence like ***“Carmen loves shiitake sesame dressing,”*** Hillary shifts gears on her bike o’lies and she recounts a couple of stories about boollies in Los Hamptones (ugh, I wish Anna Roisman hadn’t sold her soul to Hillary).
   * Story 1: They went to a 2-year old’s birthday party and at the time Carmen was “little” (no age specified), dairy-free, and mostly sugar-free. Hillary describes trying to ***“remove the cheese from the pizza as nonchalantly as possible”*** before giving it to Carmen. Then the hostess supposedly said to her ***“you aren’t going to give Carmen a cupcake? Oh, right you don’t do the sugar thing…”*** Hillary describes feeling judged and conflicted and chose to respond ***“Of course she can! Carmen eats cupcakes all the time! We love cupcakes!”*** as Carmen proceeded to take a bite of the cupcake, baking cup and all.
   * Story 2: Carmen was two and Rafa was two weeks old, and they went to a 4^(th) of July party at a friend’s beach house. Side note: in Spain and in most Latin American countries, the postpartum period is known as *la cuarentena*. It’s a 40-day period of rest and recovery for new mothers, so they can focus on breastfeeding, self-care, and bonding with their babies while receiving support from family. But ol Hilz was bopping around with her preemie in tow worried about Carmen eating bread.
   * Supposedly Carmen was going to town on some sliced baguette and according to our unreliable narrator: ***“When it got to slice five or so, I said to her in Spanish, “Carmen, would it be okay to stop eating bread until after dinner. Then if you’re still hungry you can have more.”***  Then a ***“very famous actress”*** interjected and gave Carmen two more pieces of bread only to later drunkenly apologize. The moral of this story was for us to marvel at how far Hillary has come given that she used to be so insecure but now is super chill bc she has 7 kids: ***“I must be the captain of my ship. I cannot try to fend off everyone with an opinion, but I can kindly filter their opinions when they come my way.”***  My takeaways are a) Hillary has messed up these kids but good and b) this is one of the worst books I’ve ever read – how do you “kindly filter” opinions? Pfft.

**More Bad Parenting Stories**

**Three-Year-Old Wants to Jump in a Trashcan**

* They were walking in the holiday market in Union Square and one of the kids wanted to jump into a trashcan and pitched a fit he was when told no. According to Hilz, ***“I saw so many judgmental eyes on me as my kid was kicking and screaming. I was sure they were whispering to each other that’s Alec Baldwin’s wife…what a terrible mother no control over her kid. Tsk, tsk.”***  Then she says she took the kid home, and she remembered being told that it was best to let a kid throw a tantrum in a safe place, so she took him to…her bathroom. Yes. Good thinking. Cold tiles, sharp corners, mirrors, glass, and a floor with fecal microparticles is exactly where a three-year-old should be allowed to tantrum. Wait, it gets worse – she doesn’t share any lessons learned (maybe don’t put a kid in the bathroom while tantruming?) or reflections. Instead, she simpers: ***“I filmed \[the tantrum\] so that I could get advice from my friends about what to do in this situation. Watching this video has become a favorite family pastime: all the Baldwinitos ask for it as it’s epically hilarious.”*** This explains why the kids have no boundaries but it's still tragic she does things like this to them.

**Leo Was a Biter**

* Hillary says they all agree that Leonardo is ***“the sweetest of the kids”*** but he went through a biting phase when he was 2-3 years old. According to her, Leo would fight with Rafa and ***“beat the living brother out of him”*** – is this an actual expression? – and that he had an ***“evil laugh”*** (excuse me?) when she reprimanded him. She says she tried to gentle parent and then did time-outs comprised of ***“having him stay alone in a room for a handful of seconds”*** and then ***“I would yell yelling and try to intimidate him in a controlled way like an engineer putting a train into full gear and then slowing it down.”*** Eventually she stopped screaming at him and tried being firm, calm, and consistent, which yielded results. Imagine that.

**Ilaria Licks the NYC Sidewalk But Hillary Outsmarted the Paps, So It’s a Win**

* Hillary recounts the story of going for a \[pap\] walk with 2-year-old Ilaria: ***“I was wearing a cute dress, not at all a ‘mom’ dress – meaning that if I bent over in it my butt would show.”***  Apparently, they were walking a friend to the subway (these pesky, invisible friends, gaissss) when Ilaria got upset and threw herself down on the filthy sidewalk. Hillary breathlessly describes how a man she knew was watching her from the corner pizza shop and two twenty-something girls were giggling and recording the video which was later posted on social media. The only video I ever saw was shot from a pap across the street, so these girls are as made up as the friend who needed to be walked to the subway.

[She included the pic on L. Pic on R is from a paid pap. Anyone have the pix or video from the imaginary 20 year olds? ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5j5onmcef1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f90b0aea716118c4d2f836a5524cf72d36b05b6b)

*  She tells how she refused to bend down to tend to her child (but includes a picture of the kid sprawled on the grounded taken by Mom of the Year herself) because she remembered two incidents from almost 13 years ago: ***“Hilaria, my inner monologue raged, don’t bend over and pick her up: the internet has seen your ass enough. (Side note: Right before our wedding, my dress blew up in a gust of wind. I was mortified. My father called me, angry, telling me my butt was seen all over Spain! I didn’t think it could get worse until Alec decided to lift me up in a tea-length dress in Cannes when I was eight months pregnant with Carmen. Long story short, he didn’t catch the bottom of the dress, which flew up, exposing my super-pregnant and less-than-cute bottom. On top of it, when I realized what was going on, I made an awful face. It made the front page of the next day’s newspapers. Yeah… so, toddler on the nasty ground… I wasn’t bending over.)”***

[Neither is included in the book - pic on L is just for funsies. Pic on R: you're telling me Sexy Yoga Mami couldn't squat with knees together and pointing toward the planter to prevent the kid from touching an NYC sidewalk? ](https://preview.redd.it/qggc4jelncef1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=700be0c7914011d8f3beb1ac43360ecab9fbc576)

* I’m glad to know that Señor Dave made at least one angry phone call to his ditzy daughter but back to Ilaria face planted in filth: she eventually got herself up with no help from her useless mother and Alec appeared on the scene where they proceeded to stop ***“to say hello to the group we knew”*** – the one weird dude in the pizzeria is now a group? These are plot holes, Hillary, like the holes in the Swiss cheese that is your brain. Weird dude/member of the group allegedly asked how many kids they now had and upon hearing the answer was seven, he then asked Hillary ***“you had seven kids come out of you?”***  I know. But it gets worse. In response to this question that no one asked her she did the following: ***“I blurted out the whole story, overexplaining – the live births, the miscarriages, the baby I had lost, all of it.”***  And Alec just stood there nodding? M'kay.

**Santa Hilaria de la Mala Suerte Soldiers On, Despite Strep and a “Broken Foot” (Yes, Again)**

* In order to describe how ***“amazing and chaotic”*** her life as the mother of seven of Alec Baldwin’s eight children is, Hillary describes having strep right after Thanksgiving 2024 then having to take all the kids to get tested. The only two out of nine people (nannies don’t count) who tested positive were Romeo and Hillary.
* Plot hole alert: six people vanish into thin air and Hillary, Romeo and Ilaria have to literally run to the pharmacy to pick up their prescriptions. BUT Hillary laments ***“my foot was broken, I was walking with a boot, and the three of us had to run over to the pharmacy because it was closing at 5:00 p.m. I clung to screaming Ilaria while sick Romeo trailed us, and we ended up getting there at 4:59. I told then our names and the woman said my meds were ready but Romeo’s weren’t and they didn’t have time to fill them. “We only have one more minute so we’re closing. Bye.” She was so rude.”*** Ilaria clung to you, you dunderhead.
* At this point I’m begging for some narrative cohesion – where are Alec and the nannies? Why are the two highly contagious family members running around picking up meds? Why drag Ilaria along? Where can I find the pharmacy tech and kiss the hem of her garment? Anyway, she found another pharmacy and got the meds later.

**No Manual, No Common Sense, No Hope for These Kids**

* At the end of this ridiculous chapter, Hillary gravely muses **“I remember when Alec and I had Carmen we though, ok, this is the girl we make. Then we had Rafa and we thought, And this is the boy we make.”** They are then utterly shocked when the next kid is different from the first two and so on: ***“these kids all bolted out into the world with their own personalities, spirits and paths…There is truly no manual. I must proceed with a good heart, my ego in check, and curiosity for what is to come.”*** Welp, she got one out of three. Those kids are doomed.

Chapter four is entitled “Clickbait” – 25 pages on the unfair and terrible media. A conspiracy of epic proportions out to get Alec Baldwin out of sheer malice. Should be fun.

Over the past two years, my life has changed drastically - emotionally, financially, and relationally. It started with an argument between my wife and me that escalated into a call to the authorities. I was charged with domestic violence, though I’ve not been convicted yet. I’m still working through the legal process in the hopes of getting it expunged or dismissed in the near future.

My wife and I have had a rocky relationship from the beginning. We’ve broken up and gotten back together several times, during dating, marriage, and even now. We’ve been together for almost five years, and while there’s love, there’s also been a lot of toxicity.

About seven months ago, we had a beautiful baby girl. About a month after our daughter was born, my wife insisted on moving back to California, where she’s from. At the time she was going through a lot of postpartum issues at the time, we were living in Texas. She made it clear that if I didn’t agree to let her move, she would retract the statements she had previously given to the prosecutor, a statement where she explained that the domestic incident was a misunderstanding, (none of what she had told the authorities at the time was exactly as it happened, etc. etc. according to my lawyer this would help with the conviction). I didn’t feel like I had a real choice. She didn’t force me to move with her, but I couldn’t imagine being away from my newborn daughter. So I moved with her.

We’ve been in California for four months now, living with her parents in a small three-bedroom apartment. We’re in one bedroom, and everything else is shared space. Since moving, I’ve been unemployed which has been incredibly hard. I’ve worked since I was 15 and never had a gap in employment before. In Texas, I worked at a car dealership (not sales), making around $5,000–$7,000 a month. I’ve always managed to provide for myself and my family, at least when it came to basic needs. But right now, I have run dry of my savings, no cash, maxed credit cards, and I’ve had to borrow money from my own family just to get by.

My wife has some money saved up and is currently supporting our basic needs but it doesn’t come without a cost. She constantly reminds me that I’m not providing, even though she knows how hard things have been. For example, if we go out to get coffee and she’s paying, she’ll get herself a drink and pastry, then tell me to get the cheapest item on the menu. Another time, she went out to get lunch with our daughter, knowing there was no food at home and didn’t bring me anything. (I know these examples are pathetic but there’s a lot more to it really hard for me too put her on paper at the moment). These are just small examples, but they reflect a bigger pattern.

Emotionally, things have only gotten worse. My wife is extremely disrespectful toward me. She regularly insults me calling me names like “faggot,” “broke,” and telling me to leave her almost daily. At times, she treats me like I’m beneath her, and I’ve broken down emotionally more than once even in front of her family. Then, hours later, we’re laughing in the car or having a seemingly normal day like nothing happened. It’s a constant emotional rollercoaster, and while I try to keep things together, I can’t pretend her words don’t pile up in my head.

I want to be clear: I don’t view myself as a victim. I’m just a guy going through a really hard time and I own my mistakes. But I also feel completely stuck. I’m staying in this relationship primarily for my daughter. I want to be in her life. I want to be a good father. But I also feel like I’m at a crossroads.

Tomorrow, I start a new job a sales position at a car dealership. I’ve never sold cars before, but I’ve been in the automotive industry for years and I’m confident I can make it work. That said, I don’t know how long I can keep doing this, not just the financial grind, but the emotional toll of being treated this way.

Right now, it feels like I have two options: 1.	Stay and continue being treated this way, hoping this job works out and I can rebuild something here. 2.	Move back to Texas stay with my family for a while. I left my old job on great terms, and there’s a good chance they’d take me back.

I’m torn. I’m exhausted. I don’t want to walk away from my daughter, but I also don’t know how much longer I can survive in this environment. I’m not looking for sympathy just some outside perspective. What would you do if you were in my shoes?",1,1753157649.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

6’

280lbs

High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained.
I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and  Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It’s been a long and frustrating journey. 


Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven’t shown anything interesting.


My main complaint - I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus.  No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I’m laying down. 


I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior. 


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy. 


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck.


I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever. 


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a “newer” antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. 


I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS. 


Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.). 


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.).


Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement.  They referred me for a sleep study.


Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms. 


The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch. 


Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn’t show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked “suspicious”. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted. 


The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn’t notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out. 


There may be additional testing/treatment I’m forgetting at the moment.


I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers? But I’m ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here). 


I guess my question is…. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",1,1753157482.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

TLDR My husband is a better SAHP than me and I guess it’s making me insecure?? 

For context, I have been a SAHM for about 4-5ish months. We have a 12 month old and recently found out I’m pregnant with our second baby (im 9 weeks and age difference will be about 19 months) I work a shop job on the weekends. Nothing too crazy but just a few hours to get some money for fun and occasionally to help with bills when we need it. It also gives me a chance to get out of the house and talk about things that don’t revolve around being a mom. My husband works full time during the week but has a flexible schedule so usually let’s me sleep in most mornings, helps with breakfast, distracts baby while I get my coffee ready, use the bathroom, brush my teeth, etc all before he leaves for work. 

We have no family near us and it’s just the two of us trucking thru parenthood. I consider us a great a team. I feel incredibly lucky to be able to stay home with our baby but it’s hard! I struggle with getting chores done. I get laundry started and hardly ever get to putting it away before we’ve worn thru it all. I cover dinner most nights while he takes over baby duty as soon as he gets home. 

I’ve talked to him about how hard it is for me some days and how nervous i am about bringing a second baby into the picture when I hardly have a grasp  with just one. He reassures me I’m doing great and that sometimes I make it harder on myself than I need to. I used to stay up late maybe twice a week to deep clean the house but I’ve been so tired lately I’m just not able to do it. By no means is our house a disgusting mess but it does feel like things could be better and bc of the way I was raised so much of my self worth relies on how much I get done and the cleanliness of my home. 

Recently, he’s been taking the baby out to the park and getting so much done at home while I’m at work. He’s like super dad?? And while I’m so proud of him and love him so much for it, I can’t help but compare myself to him and all he can accomplish in just a few hours twice a week while I get almost nothing done 5 days a week! This past weekend we went grocery shopping as a family before I went to to work. When I got home he had rearranged the fridge, meal prepped breakfast for us and the baby, took apart a shelf unit I had asked him to move, got a basket of laundry done, washed and changed our bed sheets all while watching the baby and getting him down for his naps on time. I’m just amazed and maybe a little jealous. It makes me feel so inadequate and when I have a rough day it makes it harder to talk about why bc he makes it seem so easy. 

Don’t know what I’m looking for here but can anyone relate to this? Feels like a terrible thing to complain about considering how many horror story husbands I read about on here but it’s just weighing on me!

1m64cnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1m64cnt/i_fell_in_love_with_a_relatives_wife/,I fell in love with a relatives wife,"To start, I have known this girl for the past 14 years. She’s quite a bit younger than I am, and she has ridden with me to the beach multiple times with my nieces and nephews. I have never thought about her romantically or visited with her until recently.

As of 3 months ago she moved in with her two kids, ages 4 and just over 1. Here’s why:

Her marriage was on the rocks after her husband (my relative) euthanized her dog three years ago because it bit him. She’s a major dog lover. Since then they have been derogatory towards each other. I’m not sure if he realized or not that she was actually being hateful when they trade banter, but she even admitted that she wasn’t good at the sarcastic teasing. She get’s mean because she gets offended.

Because of this, her husband (my nephew) was at his wits end to repair their relationship. At this time I hadn’t been around her since she was a kid when she hung out with my nieces (13), her husband’s cousin’s. He had always wanted to join the Army, and his relationship with her was to the point that he spent all his time working, or outside of the house.

I was prior Navy SO, so he came to me to train him to join the military. We started meeting at the gym at 5 AM six days a week. During these training sessions I would give him advice on how to make a wife happy. He’s very traditional guy’s guy. Macho and won’t show any so-called weaknesses. He wouldn’t go out of his way to buy flowers or show sensitivity towards her. For example he refused to read the five love languages book.

We talked about how women are different than men, and even if he finds it fun to joke around and make fun of each other, women are different. They take it personally, and that he needed to cut through the bullshit and tell her how he appreciates her. To stop and tell her that even though he enjoys joking around with her, he really loves her.

He tried this, and she reciprocated very positively. This was two weeks before he left for boot camp.

At the time they lived out in the middle of nowhere, without any support close by. The closest grocery store was 45 minutes away.

I own a property in a town that is centralized close to family and friends where she would be closer to help if she needed it. Where even in the case of emergencies, she would have neighbors that could help. Neither her husband, nor I wanted her left out in the sticks while he was gone.

Just before he left we went to the beach with some family.  Paid for everything, including hotel rooms, food and fuel. She shares a love of the beach with me. Her husband is a home-body who doesn’t mind the beach, but prefers the country or the woods. Regardless, it was an odd trip in regard to how she acted towards me.

Before we went to the beach, she was very welcoming to me, which wasn’t alarming in the least. I just thought she was just being welcoming to her husband’s uncle. I was careful to include her husband in texts to her, and to never send texts just to her. She would text me separately so as to “not bother him”, which was a little odd, but not odd enough to make me question it. She invited me and my son over for supper, and was open about having us over every night prior to her hubby leaving for boot camp.

She wanted to go with me to pick up a couch I had bought on marketplace. She was very friendly, and we connected on a level that people rarely do. We clicked on a higher level that is rare. At this time I was completely platonic with my thoughts. It was nice as I hadn’t had a friend to chat with for years. I struggle with PTSD from my time in the service, and have a hard time connecting with people, but this was easy. It was natural and made me feel at ease with someone for the first time in at least 15 years. I was glad to connect with a human like this. Prior to this I isolated myself and spent my time working, running, swimming, solo scuba diving, or in the woods isolating from any human interaction.

We left for the beach, and this is when it became very clear that something was up with her and my nephew (her husband). She wanted to go with me on late night trips to Walmart. She would lose interest if her husband wanted to go. The first time we needed something that took a trip to Walmart (30 minute trip) she was excited to go with just the two of us. Her husband doesn’t like to leave the house/hotel on the evening. She likes to go on short drives all the time. She wasn’t disparaging when talking about him, but she certainly wasn’t eager to spend alone time with him. She was certainly eager to spend time on the beach with me.

After the first night, and trip to Walmart with just the two of us, she mentioned another trip to Walmart the second night, but we didn’t have anything to get. She “just wanted to get out on a drive”. Mind you, this was at 10 PM. This was the first indication that she wanted to spend time alone with me. I declined and retired to my hotel room with my brother-in-law, his two boys, and my son. She was very friendly and defensive of me when family would tease me a little. She’s not the defensive type, and likes to tease people a little.

After the beach trip, I continued to coach my nephew until he left for boot camp. The last week or two before he left I gave them some space as we had spent the previous three weeks with each other every night. The day before he left I spent some time with them on her request. Two days after that I started helping her move his stuff into storage that I set up for them, and started packing and moving her things into my house. I have a four bedroom home. I have the master bedroom and a guest bedroom (for my boy during the summer). I had been working out of town and was home for only a few days a month.

Her husband’s brother lived in one of the bedrooms downstairs, and an autistic family friend lived in the other downstairs bedroom. She would have all the support she needed while her hubby was in training.

Then starts the real stuff:

I have been working from home (in the guest bedroom upstairs) for two weeks. She’s been staying in my bedroom the entire time. We continue to chat each day, and I do the regular things I do for family. Help out with cleaning and kids, read to them in the evening, bring her coffee in bed in the morning, make bottles in the morning for the baby, and just make life easier however I am able, and be there for support.

She insists on watching movies in my RV (away from my other roommates), but does not seem too interested in the movie. I live my nephew, and am starting to get a little concerned that she is trying to retaliate for my nephew putting her dog to sleep. She certainly wasn’t very nice to him before he left, and has been VERY persistent with me being around and being friendly with me. We spend every evening chatting and sitting in the hot tub.

I love brushing hair and giving massages… head massages, hand and foot massages, back and leg… you name it, I have thousands of hours giving massages, and I’m very good at them. She readily sits for them she is very accommodating. It’s fantastic. I have never connected with someone on this level and am becoming very close with her. At this time I am still thinking of her as a sister… but VERY close. Like special close.

It goes about three weeks, and we are doing everything together. We spend evenings watching movies together, and she is very appreciative. She wants me to spend evenings with her, and questions me when I try to make some distance between us… she is clearly enjoying the massages, and we have spent hours late into the night, every night, with me giving her massages.

We have spent a few evenings cuddling and getting cozy without kissing, but it sure feels fantastic. It feels right.

It gets to the point where when I bring her coffee in bed in the morning (we don’t sleep in the same room) that she wants to snuggle… and I am unable to resist. For at least a week we have a morning routine where I make a bottle for the baby, make her coffee and bring it to her, and then we snuggle in bed. Her leg over mine and into my crotch. Snuggle as close as possible without being inside her.

The last few mornings we grind and make out without kissing on the lips. We kiss each other’s necks, and she is very accommodating when grinding on each other. She is extremely into it. Because of this we decide I should go out of town for work.

After that it kind of peters out. She visits her hubby at his graduation. It seems like she is over her anger about the dog. We don’t talk, and I am left with an empty pit in my stomach. I am regretfully left with strong feelings for this wonderful woman, but also will never take it back up because of my nephew.

There is a bunch more, but as of right now nobody is aware. She has been camping with her family for weeks, and I don’t see her much when I go home. She is distant when I show up, which I am fine with, but am very frustrated that the only woman I have connected with is my nephew’s wife, whom I love.

So here’s the deal: I was in the middle of my current workout and decided to add an exercise I’ve definitely done before. But when I added it, Heavy didn’t show me the last weight I used — no history, no suggestions. I had to guess what I lifted last time. That’s not a huge deal on a chill day… but I work out at 6AM, I’m short on time, and trying to be as efficient as possible.

I feel like in a world where apps can predict my coffee order, this should be automatic. Suggest the last weight used. Show me the last reps. Save me from playing “guess that PR.” I’m not getting any younger and automation just helps me focus more on lifting and less on remembering what I did two weeks ago.

I added a screenshot of me adding the exercise mid workout, and it gives zero suggestions.

1m648cc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m648cc,Surgery Performed,"So, on Friday, I was called and advised that my surgery was moved to Monday (today) and that I needed to arrive at 9am. So, unfortunately, because my partner had booked off the Wednesday, and it was Friday afternoon, his boss refused to allow him to change his days off. So, I ended up discussing this with them and they agreed that I could come alone and he pick me up after work because I was the last surgery booked that day anyway. So, I took the buses and metro station to the appointment without any problems. I got to the hospital on time and almost immediately was called in for the paperwork to fill out and sign. Then, I waited until around 11am to be called back for a bed, to change into the gown and a lot more waiting. At 1pm, I had a nurse come in and let me know that if be going for surgery soon. I was given a small cup and asked to pee in it and when I came back to my bed, there was a paper towel and a pregnancy test 🤣. I figured I'd wait for the nurse to come back in case she needed to witness or do the test, even though I have taken so many over the years. Sure enough, after an eternity the nurse came back and did the test and it was negative (of course) now the funny part is even if I am, it'd have been too soon for a test and second, I have only one rainbow daughter after 15 losses in 12 years, so the chances of me ever having another since I'm 38 and my partner is 58, is very unlikely (and unfortunately, even if I was is highly likely to be a miscarriage). So, I knew what it'd be and understood why it was necessary to be safe, so no I wasn't offended or anything by this.
So, again, more waiting. Finally around 1:30pm, I had another nurse who wheeled my bed to another waiting area where I waited another 15 minutes, before taken outside the surgery door. Met the anesthesiologist who asked me about previous surgeries, allergies, scanned my bracelet. Then a second nurse and doctor took all information, explained the diets and in I went. At first, the air wasn't working, and when I saw her turn it up and was out, lol. 
Hours later, I was in the recovery room and groovy and in a lot of pain. They put something, probably Dilaudid. Which of course, I worked and back to rest. Around 6:30pm they called my partner and he drove the approximate 30 minutes to come get me. We picked up the kids from the boys' mom's place (one of my bonus sons, 7yo, asked to stay the night), so his mom will drop him off in the morning. We have split custody and they stay with us in the summer and holidays, minus sharing Christmas and Easter weekend. So, he understandably misses his mom. 
So, I'll post some pics of the stitches. I really wasn't expecting such large incisions and bruises! My oldest bonus son is 12yo and has volunteered to help me while dad's at work. As for my daughter, she's been staying close to me ""cuddling from a ""safe"" distance because she didn't want to hurt me and is now asleep on the couch, snuggles up against my back asleep. 
On our way home, after no caffeine since yesterday, I asked to stop at Tim Hortons and get a coffee and when we got home, had a glass of Carnation instant breakfast. 

Now, I'm going to take some more meds and try and sleep.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/EvKjcnDMLG): **July 14, 2025**

My sister recently told me she has been getting coffee regularly with an ex-girlfriend whom broke up with me way back in 2005. She hid it from me for over 2 months and then when she eventually told me and asked if I was okay with it I had no visible reaction and asked her what she wanted from me.

This ex and I dated from 1999-2005 from the ages of 14-20. She was cheating on me for the last 2 years and left me for the guy. It was 20 years ago. I’m 40 now. I was heartbroken but dealt with it and moved on. I have a wife I’ve been married to for 12 years. I’m a dad to 3 kids. Why would I care about someone from 20 years ago?

My sister is frustrated because I have no reaction she wants to know I’m okay with it or not. They were good friends back then but stopped talking when the breakup happened but she says it’s like all that time hasn’t passed. I guess she wants my approval? Like I said I literally don’t care. If she wants to talk to her that’s fine but I won’t be interested. It’s her life. She can talk to who she wants.

ETA: my sister also felt as betrayed as I did about the cheating hence why they stopped talking but again the whole affair was 20 years ago and I dealt with the hurt and have moved on from it. I genuinely don’t feel weird if my sister is talking to her again.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant / Top Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** NTA.

It was 20 years ago and you’ve more than moved on. I actually think you’re being quite mature and having no reaction would be a normal response to hearing about someone you haven’t seen or heard from in 20 years. Maybe your sister feels guilty for talking to her again because of the cheating?

> **OOP:** I can see why she may feel guilty because she was swiftly on my side and felt extremely hurt and betrayed too but again it was a very long time ago and I literally don’t care who she talks to as it’s not like it just happened.

**Commenter 2:** How did they start talking again if they haven’t seen each other in so long?

> **OOP:** She said apparently she was out getting stuff for my nieces when she bumped into my ex by chance. They talked for a bit, ended up exchanging numbers, have been talking most days doing a lot of catch up and have been getting coffee at least once a week now

**Commenter 3:** Nta. Just to tell her that you are fine with it full stop. Why exactly did she get mad at you for not showing a reaction?

> **OOP:** I honestly don’t know

**Commenter 4:** NTA

You’ve maturely moved on and made peace with how your relationship ended. You don’t want to get involved either way and rightfully so therefore it’s not for you to give or withhold permission.

If she continues to push you for an answer tell her that you don’t care either way but what your boundaries may be regarding the relationship - e.g. you don’t care and don’t want to hear about it, don’t want her bought around your children and wife, etc.

Might be best to loop your wife in just so she is aware and not caught out if your sister brings your ex somewhere

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/CfNzZJIgiS): **July 15, 2025 (next day)**

I posted yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/NbCHH5R0eO ) that for the past couple of months by sister has been talking and regularly meeting up for coffee with my ex-girlfriend. We broke up 20 years ago because she left me for another man and I am now 40, quite happily married and a dad and I had no reaction cos I literally don’t care about the past or what my sister does.

I realised I had never given my sister an exact answer just that I had no visible reaction just that I asked her what she wanted from me and she was frustrated over it.

I ended up calling her not that long ago and we talked about it. I asked why she felt so strongly about wanting to know my feelings about it and a lot of you suspected she wanted approval and you were right. I explained in my original post that my sister and ex were quite good friends and that the friendship ended cos I got cheated on and my sister also felt betrayed. The two hadn’t spoken in 20 years.

When my sister and my ex were friends they did a lot with me and together. They did a lot together and were almost like best friends and my sister told me that of course she was pissed and felt betrayed about the cheating but also sad because she lost her only genuine friend at that time. I know she has really struggled to maintain good friendships so she said when she happened to bump into my ex by chance and that they picked up where they left from, she leapt at the chance to kickstart their friendship. She said it’s like a fog has been lifted from her and that she feels like she has her best friend back. She said she wanted to tell me but thought I’d be weird about it because at the time, I was so cut up about the breakup. She feels really guilty for being happy about rekindling a friendship with someone who caused me so much pain.

After hearing all that I understand why she wants to maintain the friendship and why she didn’t want to tell me. I explicitly told her that I have no reaction to it because without sounding like a dick I really don’t care who she spends her time with. I told her I feel enough time has passed that I can accept my ex is in her life, especially since my sister told me she is still with the man she left me for and they are married and have a family so they are obviously serious. She also said her daughters (my nieces) are the same age as my ex’s kids and that it would be good for the kids to be friends too which I get as they don’t have many. 

I like I said have also moved on and have been married for 12 years and I have 3 kids. I basically told my sister if she is looking for my blessing, she has it but that I won’t be involved or really interested in the friendship cos it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. I also told her she shouldn’t feel guilty as it’s happened, it’s done and I moved on and recovered from it. Like if I saw the ex I would be civil but I wouldn’t be weird or anything about it cos again, I don’t really care. Plus from the sounds of it the ex will really only be mingling with my sister, potentially my BIL and their kids so I may not see her at all.

She left the call feeling at least happier and I’m just glad she has a friend back I suppose. Not an exciting update or anything but I guess a good outcome. We were just mature and civilised.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I was hoping you’d update. We exchanged a couple of comments and I did wonder if she felt guilty because you were cheated on and I guess it was right. I’m glad you two are mature enough to talk about it and that there’s no issues!

> **OOP:** Well my sister is happy and it’s out in the open now so that’s all that matters I suppose

**Commenter 2:** Advice… Your sister already mentioning your ex’s kids and yours should be friends..

FULL STOP.

You need to follow up with her, it’s a HUGE red flag. Especially if she gets your kids for a day with Auntie and she sets up play dates behind your wife’s back. You will effectively implode your wife and sister’s relationship and put you squarely in the middle (as you rightfully should be) for not drawing respectful boundaries. Your sister mentioning this is her sharing her vision of bringing your ex in for the “family” to engage with. What’s next family barbecues? Just no. I guarantee she’s already breached yours and your wife’s privacy by catching your ex up on your and your wife’s life. Which she’ll be regularly updating as life happens.

Shut this down and you’ll need to put your sis in an information diet now about personal matters regarding you and your wife’s personal matters. Because “best friends” tell each other everything..right?

Also expect your sis to want you and ex mend and become “friends”.

Protect your peace and your wife’s peace. But sure, your sis and her reunion is not a biggie otherwise.

> **OOP:** My kids weren’t mentioned at all. My sister’s children and my ex’s children can be friends. NOT mine.

**Commenter 3:** As long none of them are expecting you to reconcile with your ex and have her at events with your partner and kids, seems fine.

> **OOP:** God no. My sister was only talking about the ex being involved in her life and potentially her kids being friends with the ex’s kids.

**Commenter 4:** Is ex still with her affair partner? 

> **OOP:** Yes I believe they are now married with children

The phone's glow floated in the room, bright and sudden. I stared at the message for ages. I knew what it was. In fact, my body knew first—my guts twisted, spasming rot beneath the skin. The wet noises were audible from inside me. Just seeing the file had made me ill.

Then a war broke out in my mind: intuition versus exhaustion. A dirty, drawn-out battle where pain was the frontline tactic. I felt the trenches being dug deep in my gut—disemboweled from the inside.

But at that moment, I made a choice. One that turned my chronic decay into a hostile rebellion. Every synapse of my brain was aligned and resolved: I was ready to chase a mythical folktale called sleep.

I stood up, barely catching my balance. The pain meds hit harder than expected. They didn’t ease or resolve anything—only made simple tasks infallibly difficult. I watched myself, like a spectator, going through the motions—Tylenol and Ibuprofen, a hopeful cocktail to fix the black, rotting mold inside my organs. The pills went down easy with a gulp of cold water lubricating my throat.

Then I stumbled back to my room and collapsed onto my bed, head in my hands.

Then a voice—small, still, but near. Whispering. Not from the room but echoed through my mind, almost audible in the air:

**""Not all doors are yours to open. Not every voice that calls was sent to help you. There are sounds dressed in light—hollow things and thirsty things. You hunger for knowing, but I did not plant that hunger in you. And where it will lead... You speak of wisdom, but your hand hovers over a snare. You call it curiosity—I call it transgression. Exile. A broken covenant. Step away. The silence I give is not absence. It's mercy.""**

The voice left as fast as it came. Its calm, comforting stillness sent gentle goosebumps crawling across my skin.A warmth like love, pure and unfamiliar, passed right through me. I held on to it, savored it. But then, from the nowhere of my mind, came a second voice—boastful, booming, and smooth.

**It's just sound,** it said. **Frequencies. Words. A voice like any other you've heard. You've seen more. You prayed for clarity, didn't you? Begged for a sign. Maybe this is how answers come. Not as fire or scripture, but as a whisper. A tape no one else can hear. You're not afraid, not really. You're conscious, and that's how it begins. Not rebellion—it's revelation. Press play. If it's wrong, you'll stop. If it hurts, you'll turn it off. You're still in control, aren't you?**

His temptuous voice echoed sweet as honey in my ears. A lovely hymn that stirred something deep in me. A song, not just to hear, but to wield. I felt convicted upon hearing the second voice, but no matter how hard I tried not to, I came to a resolution.

The warmth of the first voice vanished like a fleeting breath in winter. I was left cold and rebellious. It begged me not to, pleaded with a love I didn’t deserve—but it was too late. This is the path I’d chosen, one that led me out of my garden and into something ancient and ethereal.

The ceiling fan spun above me, its breeze cool and caring, as I laid back onto the bed, the pillow caving under my head’s weight—but it offered no comfort. The lights were off. The house was silent. My stomach lining tore away in tumorous, wet shreds, like worms. Every gurgle of my insides sounded like grinding meat. My heart pounded with a manic rhythm, audible and pounding—a tribal drum warning of sacrifice. Something in me knew: the ritual had begun.

I slipped on noise-canceling headphones, sealing myself away from the outside world. The silence in them wasn’t peace—it was suffocating, a vacuum waiting to be filled by sound. My fingers trembled as I reached for my phone, the screen cold and sterile in the dark. With a final breath, too shallow to be brave, I pushed play and felt the sickness vanish. Lost and clean, something else had taken its place.

The audio began with sharp, dissonant tunes that pried at my nerves, stoking a paranoia I couldn’t shake. That’s when his voice appeared—smooth and rich, almost regal. Soothing, but seductive in its stillness, like a velvet-laced venom. He told me to close my eyes and relax.

The harsh, dissonant tones and frequencies faded, replaced by something like ocean surf. The shift brought clarity, or something like it, and I followed—eyes shut. The anxiety vanished. Went silent. Buried beneath the stillness. My body began to let go, melting into the sound. I felt peace. I felt rest.

A few minutes of this buttery noise sent relaxed shivers up my spine, like being a child again—my mother tracing lazy circles up and down my back. Out of the sea of serene sound, his voice returned.

He said he’d place a frequency in my left ear. As he spoke, a soft tone—crisp—flooded my senses with something close to sweetness. It was blissful. Almost sacred. Then came another tone—this one oddly familiar but unstable. Similar to the other, its pitch was wavering like heat off pavement. One frequency pulsed gently in one ear; the other buzzed low in the opposite—but both, hypnotic.

I sat there, marinating in the languorous syncopation. It lulled me into a deep opiate—a calm I hadn’t known since my last true slumber. After a moment, his voice returned, like Eve calling softly to Adam.

**Now you’re more comfortable, your body more relaxed, your mind calm but alert. You are ready to take the next step in your preparation.**

I didn’t move. I waited, breath shallow. The ocean sound swelling in my ears like a tide threatening to pull me under. He paused, letting the water flood my senses before continuing. His voice cut through the ambient surf.

**Now create in your mind—or simply envision—a personal energy conversion box. A strong container with a heavy lid. A box so durable, so impenetrable, that it can contain anything you place within it.**

The tones in my ears swelled—warm, inviting, persuasive.

**Think of such a box now.**

The instructions were explicit, yet their purpose remained cloaked. But in my hypnagogic haze, resistance felt impossible. It was too sweet. I obeyed.

The box materialized in my mind—steel-forged, thick-lidded, industrial in its permanence. It hovered, solitary, suspended in an infinite black abyss—a vault at the edge of thought. The box’s smooth metallic surface gleamed beneath a solitary beam of light, stark against the boundless darkness that surrounded it. It hovered there—perfect and unnatural—held in suspension like a relic not meant for mortal hands.

As I observed its contours, he spoke again, his voice coiling, calling within the tones:

**Now raise the lid of your energy conversion box. Place inside of it all your physical matter—your worries, your anxieties, your concerns. You do not need them for this exercise. They’ll only get in the way.**

His words didn’t command. They unfolded—soft and certain, as if they’d been waiting in the back of my skull.

**Do this while I wait,** he said, patient and omnipresent.

There was no debate. No decision to be made. I simply was—and then I wasn’t. In a contrary flicker of thought, I imagined placing my body in the box. And suddenly I felt it—a severing. The sheets vanished beneath me. The pillow dissolved into the air. The cold cloth that clung to my skin lifted like a veil. I was gone.

Not dead. Not asleep. Just imaginarily absent from form. I floated above, watching as the weight of my body slid off from my soul. I watched it sink into the enormous box, my worries liquefied into a thick, black syrup—drained away and sealed shut in the box. No concern. No burden. Only a quiet, infantile purity. I had become nothing but a longing for experience. Every part of my essence—except my soul—was momentarily muted and neutered by a tide of ethereal euphoria.

I let the sensation of frozen freefall cradle me, dwelling in its suspended serenity.

He spoke again—sudden, from nowhere. It startled me, but I didn’t move. His timing was exact, as if he’d been watching, waiting for the moment I’d finish his instructions. He spoke again, sultry, soft, and slowly:

**Say in your mind—say to yourself—‘I am more than my physical body.’**

He paused. I obeyed. The words leaving my lips like breath, drawn from a deeper place.

He continued, voice smooth as warm wax:

**Because I am made of more than physical matter.**

I echoed him, my tone flat but reverent, like a priest murmuring sacred rites before the altar.

**I deeply desire to expand, to experience, to know, to understand, to control, to use such greater energies and energy systems as may be beneficial and constructive to me and those near and close to me.**

I repeated every word as if under oath.

**Also, I deeply desire the help and cooperation, the assistance, the understanding of those individuals whose wisdom, development, and experience are equal or greater than my own.**

It was framed as an affirmation—but something felt off. Most affirmations are simple self-assurances, not pledges to higher forces or invitations for unseen energies to intervene. Still, I trusted him. He was the general; I was the soldier. He was the teacher; I was his fool. I recited his strange invitation.

Something in me began to shift. A subtle vibration hummed through me—barely there, but undeniable. My perception stretched, bent to strange, unnameable sensation, washed over me. My eyelids twitched involuntarily, and phantasmic images—like pressure hallucinations—flickered behind my closed eyes, as if I’d pressed too hard against them.

He had finished the affirmation, and I lay there in stillness, waiting, expecting more, yet receiving only pink noise—a warm tone moving left and right between my ears. The emptiness stretched, pensive and patient. Just as I began to wonder if something had gone wrong, his voice returned, soft, deliberate, as if it had never left.

“Here is your next path along the gateway of discovery. It is called resonant tuning. Breathe as I guide you, and as you inhale, pull fresh new energy into all parts of your body, then up into your head. Then exhale through your mouth, perching your lips as if blowing out a candle. Then think of tired, used energy moving out of your body, into the air around you. Now, at your own pace and breathing, exhale, using your physical vocal cords to hum or sing along in resonance. Do this while I wait.”

As he spoke, a low drone began to swell—subtle at first, then overwhelming, consuming the space around me. It rose into a chorus, a legion of disembodied voices. Some held a single, low, unwavering note. Others wavered, like monks intoning a forbidden liturgy. Their song slid between pitches, ascending and descending, in spectral cadence. It was ghostly and reverent, like the lament of angels. Goosebumps crawled across my skin.

I joined them.

My voice vanished, dissolving into the great, trembling harmony. I pictured energy flowing in and out, as commanded. My being expanded, filled, charged like a battery. For minutes, I floated in that sacred hum, alive with a grand euphoria. Then, the voices diminished, fading like embers and ash. They bled back into the void. The pink noise returned, gentler now, like the tide rolling in to smooth blood off the shoreline.

I sat there charged, full of peace and wonder, reaching, upward and outward, for whatever would bewilder me. I longed for whatever mystery might take me.

After a time, he spoke again.

“Now, you are complete with your resonant tuning. Proceed, and experience this new sense of being. I will wait as you enjoy your resonant tuning.”

His voice—sweet, honeyed, unnaturally calm, but delightful. Each syllable stroked my mind, coaxing it to wonder. He spoke not just to my thoughts, but to the feral, unspeakable things that lived beneath them. My sleepless disobedience—it listened and heard. He tamed it with ease, whispering to it like a flutist hypnotizing a cobra. Deliberate, entrancing, he trained it with an unholy precision.

As I lay there, weightless, barely able to feel the world around me, a realization crept in. I was slipping into a state like sleep paralysis, and yet I welcomed it. My limbs felt distant, every nerve lowered into a gentle hum. There was no fear, only the strange comfort of being unmoored. I hadn't made any grand discovery yet, but even so, I drifted in the black, boundless space, teetering on the edge of sleep.

Just as I began to tip over the threshold, he pulled me back with more instructions.

“To take another step along the path,” he said, “I will guide you to focus three. This is merely the starting point of the gateway experience.”

That caught me off guard—starting point, after all that had already unfolded. I barely had time to question it before he continued, as if reading my thoughts.

“I will count from one to three. When I reach the count of three, your mind will be much more than it is. More coherent, much more complete, more in unison.”

He paused, his silence leaving me in suspense, that pink noise drowning in the background.

“I’m going to begin counting now,” he said, lowering like the hush before a storm.

Then a quiet wrapped around me. My body tingled with a strange, creeping sensation—like standing next to a loud, ringing bell, like being pricked by a thousand dull needles. Not sharp. Not painful. Just enough to remind me I had more flesh to leave behind.

“One,” he said.

A subtle tingle boomed across my skin. Not sharp, but electric—like the echo of something ancient within me, as if I was waiting to be awakened. I felt the effects take root, not all at once, but like slow, growing vines wrapping around my nerves and bones. He didn’t rush. He let the silent breath between his words draw out.

“Two.”

The sensation deepened. My body—or whatever I still claimed as mine—began to vibrate subtly. Not shaking from fear, but from a resonance, like a tuning fork struck the center of my chest. My heart rate climbed, not from panic but from anticipation—nervous and hot. It was like the air around me was able to hear it—electric and excited.

“Three. Focus three.”

He said it again, with finality.

“Focus three.”

Everything stilled. The trembling halted. My heart rate disappeared—not slow, not quieted, just gone, as if my circulatory system had simply opted out. I was suddenly unburdened by the limits of my mind, like my mind had simply been unhooked from its anchor, and I was expanding upward, edges I didn't know I had dissolved into the space around me.

My awareness wasn’t floating or flying. It was stretching, widening, saturating everything. Thought came fast and silent—no voice in my head, just arriving, just knowing. I was both behind my eyes and miles above them, like my vision had grown wings, while my body lay forgotten.

Focus three hadn’t transported me anywhere—it had opened something, like a velvet curtain slid away from a window, or an usher pulling wide a great door, welcoming me into the next room of my own consciousness.

He beckoned me forth again.

“Focus three—the synchronized brain and mind. Relax and explore the experience of and patterns of focus three. I will call you when it is time to return.”

What felt like hours passed as I explored the inner machinations of my own mind, turning corners I had never noticed, peering into thoughts long sealed shut. I learned things—not just about myself, but from myself—like forgotten echoes teaching me things I couldn't perceive, making contact with my ethereal self.

I floated in this ennui state of mind—conscious. This strange suspended aperture was like drifting through a cathedral carved in dreamstone. My awareness immersed, layered and infinite. Each layer humming with buried instincts and memories. I could taste meaning without language. I could hear and understand the silence between thoughts—and could feel it breathing back at me.

But like the swell of a symphony, or the last glow of a candle before it dies, there had to be an end.

“I’m going to count from three to one,” he said, “and when I get to the count of one, all five of your physical senses will be working cleanly, sharply, and beautifully. You’ll be awake both physically and mentally, and come and feel completely refreshed and feeling better in every way—all when I reach the count of one.”

I didn’t want it to come to an end, but I was satisfied and content.

“Three.”

A familiar pause, full of pink noise and hemi-sync.

“Two. Your physical body is waking up and becoming more aware.”

I felt the pinprick tingling again. A slight heaviness returned, subtle at first. The velvet curtain had begun to slowly be pulled shut. The door I’d stepped through—white and radiant—began to inch close. The noises swept from left to right in my ears with a low, pendulum-like hum. It sent harsh shivers up and down my spine—a cold ripple that made my body tremble uncontrollably.

I could feel myself descending slowly, deliberately, back into the confines of my flesh. My body was now out of the box, and I was returning to it like a magnet. I began to shake—seizure-like—violently and involuntarily, as if the energy I had borrowed from this someplace higher was being ripped out of me.

That’s when he spoke for the final time, sounding with something final, something absolute—like judgment, like a judge handing down a verdict.

“One. Wake up. Stretch your arms and your legs.”

He paused and added, “This is the end of this exercise.”

The world hit me all at once. My senses returned. The sheets and blanket reappeared, their heaviness jarring. I became aware of my own breath. I opened my heavy eyes and stretched numb limbs. The room was still black, unchanged. All was the same—except for me.

All my worries returned, all crashing over me at once. I stared at the ceiling, the fan now audible with the tape’s end. I reminisced, trying to comprehend the incomprehensible. When I grabbed my phone, the bright screen hit me like a flashbang.

I recoiled from the blinding violence. When my eyes adjusted, I saw that only forty minutes had passed—just as the file had promised—but it had felt like hours. That place… was it somewhere else, or just deep in my mind? I didn’t know. I needed answers. I’d ask Jackson in the morning, but for now, I wanted to sleep. I rolled over and sank into a deep, wanton slumber—one deeper than anything I had ever known before.

**END Chapter 4**

**Chapter 5**

I woke up unsure of where I was. Everything in the room was blurred, smoothed over, like my vision had been dipped in wax. I moved mechanically—my body powering on like an old engine, reluctant but functional. Bright light spilled through the windows, softly scattered across the floor like a warm, vivid memory.

I blinked hard and rubbed my eyes until the aperture of the room became bright and focused. Slowly, I reached over and turned the analog clock toward me. Noon. I slept the entire night without interruption. A smile tugged at my face—an involuntary surge of energy bloomed inside me.

All my worries had vaporized.

I stretched deep, rubbed my eyes one final time, and reached for my phone. The screen slowly faded from black to bright as it came to life. After bypassing the lock screen, I checked my notifications.

The day had a quiet buoyancy, a sort of unspoken sweetness.

One notification was from Eve, asking if I had enjoyed my day off. Another from my mother, asking if I could call her today. I agreed. Then came the last notification—one everyone could’ve guessed.

Jack.

But something was different. I didn’t feel sick. I didn’t flinch. I didn’t tense up.

I felt like I was talking to my best friend. Like I always had.

*Hey buddy, sorry about yesterday. I should have told you about everything first. I sent you the first tape last night—don’t know if you’ve seen it yet, just in case you did want to try it out. I’m not going to push anymore. I’m sorry for all the trouble.*

I felt a deep, weighted guilt. He was right. I slept well. And beyond that, I had undergone something... more than rest. A spiritual transmutation,a sublimation.

I had ignored something he was passionate about. He really had just wanted to help. That writhing, gut-wrenching parasite I’d felt inside me yesterday? A farce.

Just like the feeling before stepping onto a roller coaster. Gone the moment it starts moving.

I hurriedly typed, trying to make amends with the person who had ostensibly tormented me—though he never truly had.

Jack, Last night I couldn’t sleep. When I got your message, I decided to listen to the tape. I don’t know how to explain it—it woke something in me. It stopped my insomnia, cured my restlessness. I can’t comprehend what I felt, or what I came to understand. Jackson, listen… you were right the whole time. I’m so sorry for how I treated you. Please forgive me, buddy. Maybe we could go out together over the weekend?

I didn’t just say it—I meant it. I wanted more. I felt ashamed of how I’d treated my friend, and I held my head in my hands. I knew I’d ask him more later when he got back to me. I needed to understand. I needed to know what greater energies—or energy systems—I had ascended to.

I slipped my phone into the pocket of my pajamas and moved through my morning routine with ease. My shower felt glorious. I brushed my teeth and combed my hair with a carefree, almost childlike innocence. Then I sat on the back porch, drinking a warm cup of coffee and savoring the day.

After a while, I wandered into the kitchen to make a sumptuous breakfast, only to realize I had no food left. All those nights of ordering out and being too exhausted to cook had finally caught up to me. But I wasn’t upset—if anything, I welcomed the excuse to get out of the house.

I grabbed my keys and stepped outside. The car started on the first try, the A/C surprisingly holding its own against the heat. I backed out of the garage, rolled down the windows, and let the sounds of birds and distant chatter flood in—bright, full of life.

I drove smoothly, in full control, no longer wrapped in that thick haze. The radio hummed without interruption. Every passing second felt tastefully luxurious. The city breathed with me, alive again.

I wasn’t alone anymore. Today was a good day.

I pulled into the grocery store parking lot, surrounded by rows of cars. I grabbed my keys and walked toward the automatic doors, which parted smoothly like a magic portal. The sound of people talking filled the air—refreshing and alive. Nearby, metal carts wheezed under the weight of their loads, and the sharp electronic dings of scanned items punctuated the background noise.

I moved through the aisles, gathering ingredients for a delicious dinner, nodding my head to the mellow lo-fi instrumental jazz playing overhead. After collecting everything, I headed to the checkout, still lost in my own world, the sound of my footsteps echoing softly on the worn tile.

That’s when I stopped. It was Eve. What a coincidence—she was here today at the same time. I walked up casually and started a conversation.

“Eve, what a coincidence. You’re here today.”

“Adam! What are you doing here?” she asked, surprised and excited.

“I just needed to pick up some groceries for the house. Wanted to treat myself,” I said, energy in my voice.

“Well, you sound different today.”

“Yeah, I finally got some sleep last night.”

“Really?” she said, happy but still skeptical. “Did you do the study with Jackson?”

“Yes and no,” I replied.

She looked at me, eyes wide with wonder.

I explained, “I went to the institute but felt sick. I didn't sleep there. Later that day, Jackson sent me a tape over text—a file. I listened to it, and now I feel great. Slept well, all’s good. But I feel bad—I didn’t treat Jackson well yesterday. If you see him, can you let him know I’m sorry?”

She listened intently, then responded, “Yes, of course I will. I’m happy you slept well. But did you say something about a tape?” Her expression was uncertain.

“Yeah, the Gateway Tape or whatever it’s called. Supposed to help you get good sleep. You and him were working on it, right?”

“No...” she said, twisting her mouth nervously. “Jackson and I only worked together once, months ago. I see him almost every day since I work in the same department when I go between the institute and the lab. But I haven’t actually worked with him in a while. Just small talk, nothing serious.”

I was stunned. I’d thought they’d been working closely for some time. I shook it off and replied casually, “Yeah, that’s my bad. Thought you guys were assisting each other.”

“That’s fine,” she said, suddenly looking uneasy. “I gotta go.”

Her whole demeanor had shifted—she held her stomach and dropped her basket, her face turned white.

“Okay, talk to you later,” I said as she hurried away.

I was stunned. What was going on? What had happened to her? The interaction had started so friendly but ended wrong—entirely wrong.

Pushing my cart through checkout, I still felt burdened by the conversation. The cashier was so cheerful I could barely stand it. I watched his boss walk away, noticing the forced smile flicker and fall from his face.

“That’ll be all for you?”

“Yes, it will,” I said, loading my bags into the cart and moving toward the exit.

The automatic doors parted with a hiss, and the heat hit me—not overwhelming, but soothing, like a warm blanket in winter. I loaded the bags into my car, struggling with the weight, then returned the cart to the collection area.

The drive home flew by, excitement building for the delicious meal ahead. Once home, I put away the groceries. Since I’d woken up late, the day was almost over—the sun halfway set, casting warm golden light through the windows like living in heaven. The day felt shorter, yet somehow more enjoyable, I thought, assembling my dinner.

I sat on the couch and watched television while demolishing the comforting meal I’d prepared. Darkness settled fast; the orange sky gave way to deep black. Resting my head on the couch, sleepiness began to creep in—something I usually felt but found foreign today.

Then a small, distinct vibration came from the ottoman where my phone sat. I reluctantly picked it up and checked the message.

After hours of waiting, Jackson had responded. Not much was said, but it was deliberate:

**“It’s okay. I forgive you. I’m happy you slept well. I’m busy this weekend. Maybe next would be great to catch up.”**

That was where it ended.

I noticed he was still online, so I texted back:

**“Okay, sounds good. Don’t want to intrude on your work.”**

At that moment, a question struck me—where had the tapes taken me? So I asked:

**“Hey man, sorry to interrupt again, but I was just wondering—what happens during the tapes? Is it all in my mind, like a placebo? Where do they take me?”**

I tried to sound casual as I waited. My phone showed he viewed the message. Minutes passed as I watched the typing bubbles pulse up and down hypnotically, like ocean waves. I was about to give up and check in the morning when he finally replied:

**“It’s six, forty-minute-long tapes, all labeled the Gateway Experience Wave One. The tapes’ names are different, each with a unique purpose.”**

I was puzzled and confused—this wasn’t the answer I expected. He typed again, so I waited.

**“Do continue your path of discovery. Listen to each tape in order three times before moving on to the next.”**

I was even more curious. I typed back:

**“Thank you, but I don’t understand.”**

He replied one last time before logging off the chat:

**“Don’t let him in.”**

**next part here**

# N.X.T     The Gateway Experience 

# Chapter 1-3

In 1972, Robert Monroe began developing a new form of auditory neuroscience—a series of recordings designed to manipulate perception, awareness, and alter identity. These tapes became known as the Gateway Tapes. Using a system called Hemi-Sync, these tapes guided listeners into deep, altered states of consciousness.

Eventually, the CIA took notice. They enlisted Monroe to explore remote viewing—the ability to leave the body and observe distant targets. Intelligence reports suggest his results were disturbingly accurate. Then, without warning, the program vanished. No explanation. The tapes stayed classified until 2003, but Monroe never spoke of it again. Those close to him said he was never quite the same.

Later, he founded the Monroe Institute—a secluded research facility in Virginia, created to continue the work no one wanted to admit was real.

The tapes were an urban legend at the Institute. Though officially unclassified, no one could find them. I'm not formally part of the Monroe Institute, but I have access—perks of my friend Dr. Jackson, who works closely with them, and sometimes our work overlaps.

That morning started like another. Tired and desperate for sleep, the bitter taste of coffee set on my tongue as I hurried along my routine. Dressed. Rushed a shower like running through the rain. I sprinted through the house, making a mess of the things I held. I reached the garage and slipped into the driver's seat. The engine's rumble barely cut through the fog in my head.

Outside, the traffic stretched on like motionless metal, hemming me in as I fought to keep my eyes open. Eventually, I made it out of traffic and onto the road toward the laboratory.  I pulled into my reserved spot—my name stenciled in reminded me I belong here, even if I didn’t feel like it today.

Inside, the quiet buzzed around me—the hum of machines, the distant rhythm of heels on tile. All this was normal as I headed to my office.

Then Eve caught me in the hallway.

""You’ve been late all week,"" she said with a warm, friendly laugh.

""I have been sleeping,"" I muttered. ""Traffic doesn’t help either.""

She gave me a sympathetic half-smile.

""Dr. Jackson is here.""

I perked up. ""Where is he? And how is the sleep study coming?""

""He’s looking for you, actually. He wants to know if you’re interested in joining.""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""I’ll find him.""

I thanked Eve politely and departed toward my office. When I got to my workroom and dropped everything I was juggling, I felt a flicker of excitement. I hadn’t seen Dr. Jackson in a while—not since that work get-together where he brought Eve. They've been working closely ever since, so it’s always good when I get the chance to see them.

Eve’s new to the lab. She works as a kind of go-between—part of the Institute and part of our department. I sat there for a while trying to wake up, head full of static.

Then it hit.

A sudden, violent wave of nausea that felt like it folded me in half. My stomach twisted like a wet cloth, wrung tightly. Skin turned cold with a slick pre-vomit sweat. Saliva flooded my mouth, thick and sour. The room pulsed, edges softening. I tried to catch my breath. The nausea crescendoed when Dr. Jackson suddenly opened the door.

""I knew I’d find you here,"" Dr. Jackson said. ""Been looking for you.""

""Hey, Dr. Jackson,"" I said, trying to sound normal, still clutching my stomach like I’d been wounded in battle.

He crossed his arms and leaned against the wall. ""How’s life been, man? It’s been a while.""

""It’s been good,"" I said. ""Some of my research actually made a difference. Saved some lives. But it comes at a price. I can’t sleep.""

""That’s… good to hear,"" he said, hesitating. ""The saving lives part, I mean. The sleep thing—yeah, that sucks.""

He paused, then added, ""Still having those nights, huh?""

""Yeah, I am,"" I said.

There was a coldness in his tone that gripped me.

""Well, Eve and I have been running an independent sleep study using some tech I found a while back."" He smiled too casually. ""You should give it a shot. It’ll help with insomnia—I guarantee.""

He gave a small, expectant gesture, like the decision had already been made.

Something was off about him. Too professional. Too perfect. It wasn’t Jack—not really. It was someone trying to put on his likeness. A masquerader. The nausea had started the moment he stepped toward my office, like his presence gave off radiation—slow, invisible, poisoning the air around him.

""How’s your schedule?"" he asked, still pressing.

""I’m not sure,"" I said, stalling, looking around to find a thought. ""I’ve got a small project I’m working on, but other than that... not much.""

I hoped this was enough to dodge whatever this was.

""That’s great,"" he said, his movements mechanical, practiced. ""Once you’re finished, you should come in.""

""Yeah, I’ll see what I can do,"" I said, trying to end the conversation.

""Well, I can see you’re busy. I’ll let you finish up. Just get back to me when your mind’s made up. Have a great day, buddy.""

He winked at me and backed out of the office slowly, letting the door close with unsettling care.

The nausea faded almost instantly—like his essence had churned the room, and now the tide had finally pulled back.

# Chapter 2

I’d considered joining the study before, but something in the way he’d changed made me hesitate. Something wasn’t right, and all of it centered around the study. The thought of joining made my stomach turn. But I had work to do, and I was too tired to dwell on it. I pushed it aside and tried to move on.

The rest of the day went on with predictable beats—meetings, data logs, half-warm coffee, and the hum of distant machines. I nodded through small talk, typed reports I barely read, and looked down. On the surface, everything was normal.

But under the meat, something writhed. Every time my mind drifted to the thought of the study, the pit in my gut boiled. Not just nausea. It was deeper, like something rotten growing inside me—something wet and fibrous. I could almost feel it tearing the lining in my stomach, dragging bloody folds of flesh with it.

My mouth would fill with warm, gooey spit. I had to choke down the chunks of bile. The pain started in my gut, cancerous and slow, but it felt like more than that. Like a warning.

By 3 PM, I stopped and glanced at the clock. The day was dragging. I was in a hurry to get home. I was tired and wanted to relax.

Finally, the clock hit six. As I headed out the door of my office, I saw the same crew of career leeches hanging back, plastering on fake grins and brown-nosing like their lives depended on it—hoping one more ""Yes, sir"" would buy them a promotion.

I didn't have the energy for any of it. Too much pride to play along. Plus, they didn't realize it wouldn't get them anywhere. I shook my head and turned toward the exit.

The same familiar white noise filled the halls. No good internet here, no music—just dull mechanical hymns. Stepping outside, it all vanished. Just silence and the sharp echo of my footsteps on the cracked asphalt.

Finally, I got into the car. The radio crackled to life with short bursts of static—no clear song, just noise. The streetlights were off, and darkness had settled faster than I'd noticed.

At a red light, I stopped—alone. No other cars. No pedestrians. Just empty streets in a large town near D.C. It felt wrong.

While I was stopped, my phone suddenly erupted. A flood of loud texts and violent vibrations perforated the air around me and shook on the console. Its harsh, bright screen lit up the dark car like a spotlight. I jumped at the suddenness, then exhaled a deep sigh, laughing it off with relief.

I grabbed my phone and checked. It was Jackson, spam-texting me, pushing me to join the study.

*Hey buddy, just checking in. You should come in. The study is going great. People are seeing huge results. Seriously, this could change your life, Adam. The door is only open for some. We saved a spot for you. Hope to see you soon, friend.*

Those were just a few texts—not including the emails and links to some weird website detailing the study. I stared at the screen, confused and a little stunned.

I’d known Jackson for years, all the way back to sophomore year of high school. He was laid-back, kept to himself, never reached out like this. This didn’t feel like him at all.

Looking at the text brought the study to mind, and with it, the chronic illness. My stomach twisted like it was trying to vomit itself out, bile rising thick and burning my throat—reacting to the messages like a body dying from poison.

As I sat there, still locked on the screen, a sharp blare of a horn shattered the silence. I jumped. A car appeared behind me, seemingly from the nothingness.

I set the phone down and stared into the black stretch of road ahead of me, then pulled off into the void, heading home. My street glowed with that cold, off-white fluorescence—so washed out, it appeared green. Houses lined the road, dark and lifeless, lights off and cars tucked away in garages, completely out of sight.

I was alone—at least I felt alone.

I parked the car and pulled the keys out. Everything felt unnervingly quiet, the whole neighborhood wrapped in stillness, except for the soft, steady chirp of crickets. All the silence in my day is starting to get to me, I thought while approaching my door.

But as I came closer, I noticed something. It wasn't fully shut, just barely ajar, opened by a coin's width. Fear crept in, but I brushed it off. Maybe when I'd fumbled through my routine, I just hadn't closed it all the way.

I opened the door. The hinges let out a long, groaning creak—just one more thing I never had time to fix. I dropped my bag on the kitchen island, passed through the dining room, rubbing my tired eyes, and headed upstairs.

As I reached the hallway to my bedroom, I felt my phone buzz in my pocket. I checked the screen. No surprise—it was Jackson. But on this occasion, the messages were wrong.

*When will you be home?* *Text me when you get there.*

I planned to ignore him, but it's hard when the messages don't stop, when every buzz feels like harassment in disguise. I told him I couldn't make it to the study—eventually—but for now, I just wanted to sleep. I slid the phone back into my pocket, lazily, and headed to my room.

I stepped into my room and froze. There, with his head down, staring at his phone, completely still—was Jackson. The air felt wrong around him. Dense.

When he looked up, his expression was calm. Eerily normal.

""Oh, you're here,"" he said.

""What the hell are you doing in my house?"" My voice was shaking. My stomach twisted, rotting from the inside out like spoiled meat left out too long. Just seeing him made the nausea swell.

This study—it made me decompose when I thought of it.

""You didn't text me when you got home,"" he said, almost annoyed. He paced casually, gesturing like this was normal, like I hadn’t found him in my locked house in the dark, waiting.

""I don't know how you found where I live, how you got in, or why you're here, but it ends now. Now get the hell out,"" I exclaimed.

His face shifted—first to pity, then into a grin far too wide, stretched. It didn’t belong on a human face.

""Are you enjoying the study or not?"" he said. His voice had dropped—no longer friendly, not familiar. The question came out low and guttural, almost a growl.

The room felt tighter. He took a step forward. I stood frozen. Neither of us moved. It felt like a standoff—one I wasn’t sure I’d survive.

Then, through the adrenaline, I remembered he had asked me a question.

""I want to, but my schedule is—"" The light died in my throat. You could see right through it.

His face shifted again. A wide smile stretched across his mouth, but his eyes told a different story. They were full of terror, like I was pointing a gun to his head.

""I take that as a no,"" he whispered. Nervous. Then tears.

A sudden, unnatural cascade streamed down his face—emotionless and wrong. The tears flowed; the smile never faded.

I staggered back, every muscle tense.

""Listen, man, whatever this is—"" I was going to go on, but I stopped, replacing my words with the cold: ""Get out of my house, or I’m calling the police.""

His face, his smile twisted, a terrible gleam igniting behind those panicked eyes. He stepped forward slowly—then suddenly, with a guttural scream ripping from his throat, he lunged at me.

My heart slammed in my chest as I threw my arms up, bracing the inevitable, stampedeous impact—but there was nothing. The air where he had been fell silent.

I looked between my guarded arms to see nothing. I stood there, unwavering and gasping, my mind swirling in a haze of disbelief.

What the hell had just happened?

I went on a raid through my own home, firearm in hand, checking every corner like it was hostile ground—but he was gone. Not a soul. Not a trace. No sign he’d ever been here at all.

I collapsed on the bed, eyes locked onto the ceiling fan spinning above me like some hypnotic machine.

Then it hit me—if he’d been here, the texts would prove it. I grabbed my phone, fingers fumbling, rushing to our thread.

Nothing. The messages were gone. The last thing he’d sent was from earlier that morning:

*Get back to me when you can.*

That’s when it all sank in—heavy and cold. I had hallucinated the entire thing. Those sleepless nights were feeding it, awakening purgatorium, and I was already too far deep.

My head was a whirlwind of thoughts, but at the center of it came a moment of clarity: I needed sleep. Deep and uninterrupted. Real rest. Something to end this miserable absence of Eden.

I could try to make it through one more night on my own. But if that failed, I knew where I was going.

My organs had turned on me, waging a slow civil war. I was going to do the study. Jackson, though acting off, was probably just a product of time being apart and sleep deprivation.

So, as I rolled over, preparing for another night of fractured, haunted rest, my skin began to crawl. My stomach twisted—acidic and full of warning.

Even now, I knew how this would end.

**End of Chapter 2**

**Chapter 3**

It was 10 a.m. on my day off. I should have been asleep. Instead, I was stuck behind the wheel, trapped in traffic that stretched ahead like a slow-motion cage. The A.C. was broken, and the heat inside the car clung to me like a thick, wet, stale blanket I couldn't shake—no matter how much sweat I wiped from my face.

Through the heat, I didn't notice my mind was leaving me. The blur of routine thickened into a fog I couldn't think through. By the time the mist cleared, the Institute had already appeared in front of me. Its towering wooden decks and polished terraces loomed high above me—familiar yet distant, like remembering a dream after waking.

The place was massive. Even the walk from the parking lot to the lobby was quite the trek. In case it wasn't clear, I hadn't slept. Instead, I became paralyzed with nausea, a passenger in my own body, just along for the ride while my stomach twisted and turned in slow, uneasy circles.

I got up around 6 a.m. and checked the website Dr. Jackson had sent me yesterday morning. My eyes stung from the screen’s glow, the text blurring until I blinked hard enough to focus. The study was listed as being hosted at the Monroe Institute. That did not surprise me—I’d worked with Jackson there before. Still, something about seeing the name this early in the still gray light of morning made my chest tighten. Familiar, but not comforting.

The Institute feels out of place. It's in the middle of the woods. It sticks up like an obelisk committed to ancient deities. Yet I found myself pulling into an almost empty parking lot and held my stomach as a wave of nausea clawed its way from my gut up my throat like a scream trying to escape. I choked on the chunky bile and chugged the remaining bit of my energy drink.

I killed the engine and stepped out, heat radiating off the cracked pavement, sharp and blinding. I crossed the lot, thinking—why was I here? A redundant rhetorical question.

The sound of my footsteps was loud and echoed, yet every noise I made went silent when the cool A.C. slapped me with a harsh blast. The noise of people going about work drowned out the sound of my advance toward the front desk. The building seemed to swallow me whole.

I saw the security guard look up from his desk.

""Good morning, Adam.""

""Good morning, Jerry,"" I replied.

""What are you doing here today?"" Jerry asked, polite and curious.

""Jack wanted me to come in for a sleep study he’s hosting.""

""Oh, then tell him I said hello,"" he said with a smile.

I'd met Jerry and most other staff during a project with Jack here at the Institute.

""Will do. Have a good one,"" I said, turning away toward the break room.

You could practically see the excitement on Dr. Jackson's face. He lit up the second I scanned into the break room. The way he smiled made the air feel heavier. The hallucination came to mind, sending waves of fright and gut-wrenching nausea with it.

""You’re here,"" he said, gesturing big. ""Eve mentioned you were taking the day off.""

How did she know that? Had I told her yesterday? I couldn’t remember, and I was too tired to care.

""Yeah,"" I muttered. ""I was, but as usual, I couldn’t sleep.""

""Man, that sucks. So I assume you’re here for the..."" Then he paused. He let his words trail off and hang in the air. He didn’t need my answer—he already knew.

""Perfect. That’s what we’re here to fix, right? Well, then let’s not wait. Let’s get started, shall we?""

He shifted his attention toward the door.

""Follow me,"" he said.

We stepped out onto the polished tile, smooth and cold beneath our feet. The wall was like marble—bright and sterile, unsettling in its emptiness. No artwork, no signs, just silence and the hum of overhead lights. Quiet, muffled murmuring came from above like quietly spoken Hail Marys.

We passed a series of closed doors, each workspace sealed tight—the kind of silence that makes you feel watched or that you must obey. The hall twisted left and right, pristine corridors that felt more like catacombs than offices.

Finally, we reached a single, heavy door. Jackson swiped his card, and it opened into a small narthex, a dim antechamber—a space between what was and what comes next.

He turned to me, grinning.

""Are you ready?"" His smile was big, polished, seemingly rehearsed.

""Sure,"" I said uneasily. It felt like standing at the edge of a garden I wasn't meant to enter, knowing full well I was past its gate

He opened the acoustic glass door with a small, slow push.

""This is the studio,"" he said proudly, gesturing like he was showing me a grand plaza.

""So it’s like a recording studio? For music?"" I asked, uncertain. A sleep study wasn’t supposed to look like this.

The control room we stepped into opened onto a larger space where recordings would take place. Warm crimson soundproof paneling covered the walls, interrupted only by the deep, dark brown wainscoting that stretched to the floor. The room was dark and atmospheric. It was strangely refreshing—but far from reassuring.

He nodded, agreeing it was an odd location. ""Yeah, okay. I kind of lied, but just hear me out.""

His voice turned pleading, trying to usher me past the rising suspicion. I shot him an intrigued, skeptical look. He cracked under it.

""This isn’t where the study takes place.""

My face dropped with exhaustion. ""Then why am I here, Jack? I just wanted to sleep, go home, and enjoy my day off,"" I said.

I knew it was a lie the second I said it. I wasn’t getting any rest. But he bought it anyway.

""It’s because this is where we create the experience.""

I stared at him sideways. ""I thought this was going to be wires and brain scans—a clipboard full of questions. Then you tell me you can’t help. What experience are you talking about?""

He hesitated. ""This study is a front,"" he said at last. ""It gets people through the door. Then we play the tapes live so we can monitor behavior.""

My patience snapped. ""Jackson, what the hell is going on here?""

""It’s simple. The tapes help shift perception, alter awareness. It helps people sleep.""

""That’s it?"" my voice said flat.

He nodded. ""That’s it.""

My guts twisted suddenly, violently. The panic struck like a hook, dragging through my insides—wet, tearing, full of heat and pressure. I doubled over. It felt like my organs were swelling and rotting at the same time, bloating with something they couldn’t contain, like something was trying to claw its way out.

""Where are the others?"" I choked while creeping up my throat. ""The other participants?""

He smiled too warmly. ""It’s just you, buddy.""

My breath came in sharp gasps. Between the lies, his odd behavior, and the screaming in my stomach, everything told me nothing about this was safe.

""Jackson,"" I said, trying to straighten slowly. ""I can’t do this. I feel sick.""

I grabbed the hat I’d left on the control board and turned toward the door.

""No, wait, the study will help with the pain. I’ll get you something—pain meds, anything.""

I spun around, facing him. ""Thank you, Dr. Jackson, but I have to go. Today’s my day off.""

My tongue gripped him tightly. It met his soul with a slap. His shoulders tensed, his mask cracking.

""Adam,"" he said softly.

Something in the way he said my name seized my steps. It froze me. I turned. He stood there with his head lowered, voice full of betrayed sorrow.

""I’ve known you forever. I just wanted to help. I thought you’d like this, Or think it’s cool. I don’t know what I was thinking.""

""Jack, I get it. But the longer I stay, the sicker I feel.""

His head sank lower, like a snake retreating into itself—defanged and ashamed, coiled up, slack and defeated.

""Have a good day off, Adam,"" he said quietly while staring at the floor.

I’d like to say I left smoothly, walking with purpose, finding the lobby without issue. But the truth is, I got lost. In the cathedral-like sprawl of the Institute, every hallway felt identical. The sterile halls stretched on like some endless maze.

Eventually, I heard the distant murmurs of life—voices, movement—and stumbled toward it with the grace of a drunk man looking for home. Soon, the vast lobby opened before me. I must have looked paranoid. I got some uninviting looks from people. But Jerry threw his hand up in farewell. I mirrored it without a word.

Then the doors opened, and the heat hit me like an oven door flung wide open—thick, searing, and slow. I was a walking roast under the sun.

I found my car easily. The parking lot was barren. No need to search. For how many people worked here, the desolation felt impossible. I climbed in and flipped on the A.C. A wet blast of humid air hit me like a breath from a sick animal. I dropped my head to the wheel and white-knuckled it.

What the hell am I doing? This day was my day off. And I wasted it. Half of it gone—a terrible start to my three-day weekend.

I wiped the sweat from my face, put the car in drive, and pulled onto the road. The woods swallowed me quickly, miles of winding pavement shaded under a canopy of thick pine. It was colder here, but darker too.

That’s when I saw something in the trees—a figure, half obscured by the undergrowth. Jeans tucked into a shirt. A lab coat.

It was Jackson.

I sped past, too fast to be sure. I craned my neck to check again, but the space was empty. I shook it off, my mind still fogged from the heat.

A few miles later, with the windows down, cracked for air, I saw it again—clear this time, right by the median.

Dr. Jackson stood there perfectly still, his mouth pulled into a grotesque smile. Too wide. Skin stretched into deep creases like a theater mask left out in the rain. His head hung low at an unnatural angle, a thread of black, syrupy saliva drooling from his lips to the ground in slow motion. His lab coat was soaked in red—splattered, violent, chunky smears.

Those eyes—lifeless, accusatory—fixed on me. They gleamed like polished, rich stones, but full of rage and nothingness.

My stomach turned violently, bile rising like acid in my throat. I gagged at the wheel, swerving slightly as his image clung to the side of my head.

I didn’t look back again. I just wanted out of the woods—back to civilization, to anything familiar. Something about this drive felt wrong. Unreal. I knew it wasn’t right, and it didn’t matter. Whatever this was, it was soaked in rage and filled with something ancient and evil.

I kept driving and driving, but the trees didn’t end.

My grip on the wheel tightened with each passing mile. Hypervigilance gnawed at my nerves, feeding a rising panic that crawled up my spine and pressed on my guts. The deeper I went, the worse it got, until the taste of this morning’s breakfast crept up—arising in my throat, bitter and sour with dread.

At this point, I was flying down the hill, trying to escape this all-consuming garden. It was darker now, my headlights barely reaching ten feet ahead. The heat was an afterthought—I just needed to get home.

Suddenly, the radio came alive. Jarring static screamed, distorted voices like the damned clawing their way out of hell. I reached for the dial, panicked, but the noise wouldn’t stop. The buttons refused to respond. I slammed my fist into the center console angrily until, finally, the sound cut off with a shrill whine.

Then silence.

I turned back to the road and saw nothing. It was pitch black. I hadn’t turned on the brights yet, but it was too late. Too late to see Jackson. He stood in the center of the road, grinning—his face twisted in a manic, inhuman joy.

I didn’t even have time to react, to scream. I hit him head-on. I heard the metal crunch. Something thick and wet slapped the windshield. I heard his bones snap like crab legs, felt the thought of his flesh going under the wheels—half his body over the car, the other half beneath it. A sickening crack echoed the spine, tore like a wishbone. All I could hear were the sounds of dismemberment and bisection.

I skidded to a stop, tires groaning. I was breathless and shaking. I couldn’t believe it. The heat in the car vanished, replaced by a cold sweat. I stumbled out, the silence unnatural—no crickets, no wind, just the creak of my car door and wet splash of blood under my shoes.

He was everywhere. Limbs flung across the road. Entrails spilled. It looked like someone had popped a balloon full of red paint. His torso lay split, his eyes staring right at me. I gagged and cried, grabbed my phone, but I couldn’t dial. My hands were slick with blood.

Then a loud bang.

I jolted.

I was back in the car. No blood, just a bright sun. Jerry knocked on my window.

“Hey Adam, saw you leaving hours ago. You alright?”

I looked around in horror. I was still at the institute. I had hallucinated once again.

“Yeah,” I muttered through shaky lips. “By chance, do you know what time it is?”

“Six o’clock,” he said, cheerful and clueless. “You okay?” he asked.

“Yeah. Thanks, Jerry.”

I was soaked in sweat, hands trembling. I couldn’t drive. I was unstable, unfit. I reached for the keys, but then the radio crackled to life—quieter this time. Static cleared, and a preacher’s voice came through, menacing and resolute, reciting scripture that convicted me:

*“What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.”*

My body trembled. I yanked the keys free from the ignition and stumbled out of the car, heading toward the bus stop, the weight of his voice ringing in my skull. I tried to justify it with other thoughts, but it failed.

I got some rest on the bus ride—not good rest, just enough to blur the edges. The bumps, loud groaning engine, and those stiff plastic seats made sleep a nuisance. By the time I woke, it was already dark. I decided to get off a few stops early. I needed painkillers and maybe some sleep meds. Figured it was worth a try.

I signaled the driver, who nodded without a word. The brakes hissed, and I stepped onto the quiet street. A corner store’s LED sign lit up the sidewalk like a beacon. It had cooled off, the air now holding that early morning chill that bites at your skin. The automatic doors parted with a wheeze. A fake bell chimed overhead, drawing no attention from the teenage clerk behind the counter, absorbed in his phone, lost in a different world.

I drifted through the aisles, picked up what I needed, and made my way to the checkout. He barely glanced at me while he rang everything up. I recognized that dead-eyed expression. I’d worn that same look earlier.

“That all?” he mumbled.

“That’s it,” I said—instantly thinking of Jackson saying it earlier.

“Thirty-one fifty-nine. Want to round up for charity?”

I blinked at the absurd price. “No. Not today.”

He shrugged and tapped the screen. “You’re good.”

As I turned to leave, he shot me a sideways look—half-disgusted, half-judgment. I didn’t need it. Not tonight. I knew how cheap, hollow, and penurious I looked.

I walked home. It wasn’t far—maybe ten minutes. Though, in the fogginess of derealization, it could’ve been hours. I grabbed a glass of water, not bothering to stay up. I was going to bed early.

I downed enough pills and sleep meds to sedate a whole village. I didn’t care. Either I’d finally get rest, or I’d die from an overdose. At this point, both sounded like mercy.

I went through the motions of my routine and crawled into bed. The A.C. hummed. The sheets were cool and clean. My mind, for once, was still.

But sleep didn’t come.

I stared at the ceiling. Then I glanced over and saw **2:56** blinking red—pulsating like a wound. I rolled over and sighed, a bitter, tired exhale.

“Wish I was dead,” I muttered under my breath. Half-joke, half-prayer to a god I wish I knew.

That’s when my phone lit up the room. I didn’t want to check it. No one would text me this late—except for him. And after everything, I didn’t know if I could handle seeing his name.

But part of me—the part still haunted by that hallucination—needed to be sure he was okay. So I checked.

It wasn’t a message. No apology. No explanation. No plea to come back in.

I felt the sickening taste of bitterness return as my stomach twisted violently.

Just a single 40-minute audio file.

1m63yhh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m63yhh,Interior of the Tune M1 Camper on the Ford Maverick,"I was wicked hyped about all the places I went with the camper on the Mav that I completely forgot to put any picture of what it looks like on the inside on my last post! 

So here’s what the inside looks like!! It’s a little (a lot) cluttered - I tend towards glamping so I travel super heavy. Ignore the tube, that’s AC running from the cab vents because it was super hot, it’s not usually in there.  I’ve also been living out of it for just under a month, so it’s not at its most pristine. 

I don’t know how to label the individual pictures, so here’s a super long post explaining:

The footlocker is for all my storage of things I don’t access a ton but still want (clothes, board games, tools, air compressor, tire patch kit, water purifier, extra tent, extra air mattress for friends, etc.). It’s sitting on top of a cutoff pantry shelf so I can have storage underneath. 

Underneath are three milk crates - the one toward the front is a bunch of stuff I use all the time when camping; soap, matches, bug spray, sponges, wipes, coffee mugs, etc. the random bunch of stuff bungee’d to the exterior are things I either use a lot or want quick access to that don’t fit in the milk crates. 

the middle is cooking stuff I use a lot (all my spices, oils, hot sauce etc), and the last is a dry/canned goods pantry. I also have another milk crate underneath the Goal Zero power station with my camp stove and utensils. I carry 2x 3.5 gallon jugs in the back, and another in the truck with an electric spigot so I can easily fill water bottles. 

The white round thing is a kibble container that I use for trash (it works super well to contain smells even on really hot days!), and the black box on top of the fridge is a pump sink so I can have running water. 

I use the bump out on one side for various storage of items I’m constantly getting in and out of the truck at camp sites- camp mat, camp chairs, a collapsible shower, an entire bag dedicated to coffee, hygiene etc. I’ve discovered that having a bag dedicated to something you do a lot makes it a lot easier when you’re sorting through stuff. 

The dual zone fridge-freezer is under the sink, it takes about two seconds to move it out of the way - and is usually out of the truck when I’m cooking. I tend to keep an insulated bag in the cab of the truck for drinks, and I’ll swap a frozen water bottle into it from the freezer to keep things cool as I’m camping but make it easier to access. 

The black thing in the corner is a truma propane heater that runs off the 10lb tank on the exterior. I move the sink out of the way so it can heat the space and have a CO2 monitor.

I have setup so that I can shower/use the restroom inside or outside the truck, depending on where I’m at and my comfort levels. 

I don’t spend usually a ton of time just inside the truck— usually the point of camping is to get outside, but I did try to set everything up so that I COULD do everything inside if I needed to! ",16,1753156101.0,FordMaverickTruck,4,1.0,False
1m63wvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1m63wvp/i_sleep_to_pass_the_time/,I sleep to pass the time,"My parents recently moved back to their home country. My sister (and bestfriend) is in a several months long forestry program and only communicates with me through letters. I love my long distance boyfriend and we spend a lot of time together but he's often busy. I don't have close friends, somewhat due to my own fault.

I used to be in a friend group with my sister, there were 6 of us and we were friends for 5 years. i would call them my sisters, we knew everything about each other, and they helped me and my sister with a lot of family and religious trauma. We were super close until the majority of us went away for college, but we always bounced back to normal when we met during breaks. At some point, I guess by the nature of long distance, there were misunderstandings. I also wasn't a very good friend to one girl in particular. I was confronted about a shit ton of misunderstandings and my actions towards that one girl. I apologized to the girl directly and in private and she was willing to make our friendship work, but others in the group didn't think the same. They were conflating a lot of the misunderstandings as evidence for me not being a good friend to them either. I didn't want to be the tear in all of our friendships so I took a step back. My sister stood by my side for the misunderstandings, and only speaks to 2 of the girls now. I don't speak with any of them. All this being said, I've learned a lot, and even though I lost my closest friends and have no one, I don't blame any of them. I just feel... lonely.

I work, I go home, I call my boyfriend and hope he has time to hang out with me. When he's busy I try calling my mom, but she is oftentimes also busy. So I watch shows, I read, I scroll on tiktok, but I'm always aching for a text or call. I want to go out to eat, shop, hike, go get coffee and sit in an empty parking lot to talk until all the other cars have left. I want to do kareoke, I want to play board games. But I've never done these things by myself and its as if I've lost everything that makes me fun and enjoyable. Some days all I do is sleep.

My boyfriend and I sleep on the phone together, and recently i've just randomly started crying. I'm really good at keeping quiet and when I'm sure he's asleep I mute so he doesn't hear my sobs (i hate that the iphone mute button echoes in the call when you press it, what a fkn snitch). i know that the reasonable thing to do would be to get new friends, but how can i do that when im still mourning those 5 years?

i see the other girls out in public and i feel physically ill. i remember all the fun we had and i just want to go home and cry. even worse is that i work with two of them (they were at the company first but only worked for their college breaks, they have now graduated college and will now be working at the company for a whole year). We're really good co-workers, but when i hear them laughing and planning hangouts i just feel so sad. its actually so bad that i want to quit even though i love my job and am getting paid way above market value. i know that i deserve some of this, but not everything.

ive started losing weight, ive stopped pursuing my hobbies, and all i ever think about is that im a horrible piece of shit even when i know it isn't true. i know im having serious indicators of depression and its making me anxious because i don't know how to stop it. the friend break up happened slowly over time and it formally ended in january. i think it being summer now and me seeing the girls at work is actively making me tweak so much now, i wasn't like this a few months ago

i want to tell my sister but i don't want to stress her out in her program. my parents are retired and living their best lives with family and i don't want to talk to my boyfriend about it. he's heard it enough times,. he just moved in with his friends after living alone so he has less time to call and hangout. he knows i get sad sometimes and he asks about it but i don't want to burst out in tears so i say im just tired.

idek why im writing this tbh i guess i just want to rant. it does make me feel better though",1,1753155961.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

We’re currently torn between Cambridge, Back Bay, and possibly others nearby.

Cambridge feels like it could be a great fit, but we’re wondering:

- Is it too student-heavy, or does it have a good family vibe too?
- Are there parks, toddler-friendly activities, and community spaces?
- How’s the access to restaurants, coffee shops, and nice spots by the water for date nights or weekend outings?

We’re ideally looking for:
- A safe and walkable neighborhood
- Easy commute to MGH
- Kid-friendly amenities
- A mix of quiet + fun (we still like to go out occasionally!)
- A sense of community and diversity

1m638nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m638nk/ms_old_friends_pt_1/,[MS] Old Friends (Pt. 1),"My friends told me that retiring at forty-eight would be a walk in the park, but they failed to mention that you can still trip and fall. It was only a month after I retired that my wife and I had separated from our twenty-three years of marriage, and my now ex-wife, Monica, would tell anybody else that the fault was mine. After retiring at the top of the detective class, a title I held true for fifteen years, we tried to start a family. Unfortunately, after not having any luck, Monica went to see a doctor and found out about her infertility. The following week, I came home after grocery shopping in the morning, and she was gone. All that had been left behind was a note in which she called me selfish and blamed me for the failure of our marriage. The divorce papers were served the following Friday afternoon. I was watching TV when the doorbell rang; I clicked the TV off and answered the door to a young kid who smelled of weed and cheeseburgers.

""Here ya go, sir, you have been served.""

Besides my life coming down harder than the Roman Empire, I would say it's been simple.

July 23, 2032

Today, I woke up in a better mood and took my dog, Ranger, out for a walk. Ranger was a dog I had given Monica as an anniversary present; Ranger was more of a gift for me since Monica had something against dogs. When Ranger and I walked home, the mail courier left my porch.

""Good afternoon, sir; it's good that you showed up so I can deliver your package. Stay safe and have a good day.""

He handed the package to me, and in a split second, his eyes caught mine, and I noticed an eerie, wide smile across his face. Although before I was able to say anything else, he walked up to his mail truck and drove away. Once inside, I set the package on the coffee table and made dinner. Monica cooked a lot of the time, but I was no stranger to the stove. After I ate, I sat on the couch with a cold beer and watched the news. 

8:46 pm

It did not take long for the package to catch my attention again; the box was unorthodox, and it seemed to be wrapped almost as if it were a gift. The cardboard box was wrapped in brown paper and tied closed with butcher's twine. The post label only had my name and mailing address, but no return address. I decided to open it because, in my eyes, I had nothing else to lose. I got up, grabbed scissors from the kitchen drawer, and snipped it open. A small, square box, its white surface reflecting the light above me, contained a cassette tape with a note inside. The tape was labeled with a permanent red marker,

""Bygones.""

The sight of the tape left me wondering what all this could mean. I could not help but feel like a thousand eyes were staring at me from the inside. Then I remembered the Walkman Monica left behind; she said it was half-broken but still played tapes decently. I had practically torn the house up looking for it, but I popped it in and started the tape once I found it.

""Hello Jonathan, long time no talk, I wouldn't expect you to know me by my voice, but I just wanted to make contact. Ten years ago, you ran into your first wall as a detective with my case, the bombing of the metro train station. Twelve people: five adults, three kids, and four elderly. All died in vain because you couldn't do your job right, and the press wrote me off as dead just because you couldn't figure out who I was. So because of all this, their blood stains your hands to this very day. If you want to make things right, meet me at the address on the back of the note, and there you shall be executed for your crimes against the ones you swore to protect.""

I took off the headphones and walked to the kitchen, staggering for balance, my heart thumping against my chest, it echoed in my silence. I picked up a new beer bottle, opened it, and chugged it to finish. The only mistake in my career has come back to haunt me, and my world is crumbling. The retirement that bores me, my wife leaving me because I'm unable to satisfy her, and now the one who got away wants to see me meet my end. Although I do not think they were counting on me having nothing to lose, and with this, I will make my own end. The note was in the white box; it had been a sticky note with a location and time:

""WEST SHIPYARD 8 O'CLOCK; COME ALONE.""

The bottom script provided me with a date for the meeting, and I prepared accordingly.

So I've been in Ukraine for the past 3 months, but due to some personal reasons, I wasted the last week away, and didn't get any gifts for people back home, as I planned. I want to make up for it - I fell in love with your country, and I want to keep a piece of it with me back home, and also share it with my close ones.

I'm looking for tips - e-shops, Instagram profiles, small businesses - basically any place I could get some meaningful gifts for people. I don't have anything particular in mind - I would just like it to be Ukraine-""themed"", by colors or words.

What I have so far are some random socks and coffee mugs in my shopping cart at Rozetka 😅 I'm sure there's more to be found there, but it's also a general store selling anything and everything, and it's overwhelming. I don't wanna browse through iPhone chargers or Nike sneakers, and I don't see a way to filter the products down the way I want.

Do you have any recommendations for smaller alternatives, where I could buy some meaningful gifts - household items, clothing, random accessories? Anything from a T-shirt to a wine opener, but I'm looking for something with a ""soul"", maybe something more ""hipster"", as opposed to basic cheap tourist souvenirs like a keychain with an Ukraininan flag, if it makes sense. But socks are fine as well 😄

Or, do you have an equivalent of Etsy or Vinted?

Logistically it shouldn't be an issue - I did make friends in Kyiv, so I'm able to order to their address and have them send it to Czechia / Slovakia by Nova Post.

It still sucks I'll be ordering this online as opposed to just randomly stumbling upon something when wandering the streets in Kyiv, but that's the best I can do at this point.

Wet.
Homeless.

Those three words clung to the guy who sat slumped outside my coffee shop in the afternoon rain.

Perfect. 

Thanks to the increasingly erratic weather, I had the privilege of seeing him in all kinds of seasonal wear: a short-sleeved tee and shorts in the late morning while he chewed on a bagel; later at lunch, sporting a jacket and baseball cap. 

Around then, when the sun scorched the sidewalk, he’d been uncomfortably bent over a dog-eared paperback. 

College student. Early twenties.

I couldn’t tell if he was enjoying the book, but he flipped through it quickly, head cocked, eyes glued to each page.

When I glanced out later while wiping down tables, the book was gone. 

He was curled up, pressed into a nest of soaked blankets, trying to hold onto what little warmth he could. 

A cheap plastic raincoat was draped over thick brown curls.

I found myself fascinated by him as the day crept on and he shifted positions. 

I made pastries, watching him with floury fingers, mesmerized as he sat, knees pressed to his chest, staring up at the sky. 

He sat up, then lay down, eventually curling into the fetal position, placing the book over his face.

I made the mistake of peeking out of the window while serving a patron. 

The boy lay on his side with his back to me, unmoving. 

I excused myself, grabbed a blanket from the back, and rushed outside. 

From my observations, he didn’t *seem* sick. 

I nudged him with my shoe, only to be met with a loud protesting groan. 

“I’m not *moving*,” he grumbled, curling further into a ball. 

He emphasized his words, yanking the covers tighter around himself. 

With a start, I realized his tone was something authentic that  I could appreciate, sardonic and deadpan, with a sliver of irony.

“I’m not doing anything wrong except existing, and I’m so sorry for my presence. If you touch me, you'll regret it.”

I pulled the blanket tighter around me, holding it close to my chest. ""Do you... want to come inside?""

He didn't respond for a moment, twisting around to face me, blinking rapidly through thick brown locks plastering his forehead. “Shit,” he muttered. “You're not Karen.”

I frowned. “Karen?”

“Karens,” he smirked. “Plural. They've been shooting me dirty looks all day.” 

He cocked his head, amused, maybe intrigued, maybe something entirely else. 

He did seem to suddenly care a lot about his hair, shaking it out of his eyes like a wet dog. 

“Did you… want something, dude?”

Up close, he wasn’t the type I expected to be homeless: attractive face, sharp jawline, wide brown eyes that reminded me of rich coffee grounds, and freckles speckling his nose. 

Having not lived in the human world for long, I had only just started to learn about societal norms and prejudices. 

He was too clean, hair neatly tucked under his hood and his nails clipped. 

His hygiene was intact, and though his clothes were crumpled, a loose pair of jeans and a jacket, they weren’t stained. 

I was kind of in awe.

This was a boy who took care of himself, even on the streets, and I couldn’t help but appreciate that. 

Perhaps it was vanity, or maybe just self respect. 

But then, maybe I had been staring at him for too long.

I was aware I was also soaked, my flimsy umbrella doing nothing to protect me from the vicious downpour, my own hair sticking over my eyes. 

The boy regarded me with amusement, tilting his head like a kicked puppy, his lips curled in something resembling a smirk. When I snapped to and offered the (now soaked) blanket, his expression darkened. 

I was so close to him, I could finally see what I couldn't from afar. When I was observing him from the window of my shop, he was an ordinary human. 

But now I could see his face. The one he tried to hide, ducking under his blankets and hidden behind cheap shades. 

I could see the hollowness in his eyes that was so cavernous, endless, with such prominent shadows and a smile lacking so much warmth that I struggled to fully comprehend the depths of this boy’s despair. 

I had never quite met a human like him before. Through expression alone, I could read a human face. 

I could see their wishes and dreams, their hopes for the future. But this one… He was *blank*. 

A nothing, a nobody; a terrifying, hollow shell of a human being. 

The best way I can describe it is like an aura blossoming around him, thick mist suffocating his thoughts, suffocating him. 

Squeezing the happiness from his brain. 

But looking at him, I wasn't sure this boy even knew what happiness was, or had ever known it. 

His entire being, his soul, his mark on this planet, was little more than a smear. 

Depression is what humans call it. We call it severing the will to live. 

Humans can learn to live with it by altering their brain chemistry. 

But to us, it's a death sentence.

Worse than the plague that wiped out my kind. The human boy was dripping in it. 

Drowning, but choosing not to break the surface. 

I stumbled back at the thought of it being contagious, my breath catching in my throat. He wasn't just depressed. 

His will to live was already severed, already withering as time cruelly crept on. 

This human boy wanted to die!

No, not just that. 

He was *going* to die. 

I saw eerie confirmation in dull eyes that didn't quite meet my gaze. 

He was planning his death. 

“What?” the boy’s lips broke out into a grin, and I found myself momentarily losing my mind. 

He shuffled forward, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. 

I had to refrain from stepping back. “What's with the glaring? Do I, like, have something on my face?”

I ignored his laugh. His entire world was still intact, every loved one alive and well, yet this human demanded a fucking pity party. It was pathetic. His smile was fake.

His attitude was faker. I wasn't allowed to pass unfair judgments. 

That's what humans believed. But I could *still* have an opinion. 

He was exactly why my kind had a particular distaste for his. 

Destroy their own planet, and cry victim. 

In his case, destroy his own life, and blame the world instead. I glimpsed his book. 1984. Typical. 

I had read it six times, and each time was more grueling. 

For such a smart species, you would think they would understand that “We don't care until it's affecting *us*” would be recognized. 

They had lived and fought through two world wars, and yet somehow, through pure selfishness, they were repeating the exact same mistakes. 

I knew my kind was not perfect. But we were self aware. 

Humans, however, were going in circles. This particular human was a walking contradiction. 

His attractiveness was a privilege; this boy was a child having a tantrum, crying out to the “unfair” world, and as a protest for not being heard, he was going to take his own life. 

I wished my family had that privilege. I wished they could *choose* to die, instead of coughing up their internal organs and suffocating in their own blood. 

I could feel my blood rising, shivers skittering up and down my spine. 

I had sat with my mother for three days straight. She died on the first day, and I held her, cradling her to my chest. 

Mom didn't want to die. 

She wanted to live. Jun, my sister, who died crying, died coughing up her own ravaged lungs, wanted to *live.* 

This boy was a *coward.* His whole kind were cowards. 

I almost turned and left him, my teeth gritted, my stomach crawling into my throat, revulsion filling my mouth. I had already made my choice with Blue. 

I had made my choice with him two weeks earlier, when he first slumped down on the bench outside my shop and shot me a friendly smile through the window. 

I couldn’t back out, no matter how much the human boy repulsed me. 

Backing out would mean breaking my last promise to Blue. 

“Do you want to come inside?” I asked him. “Coffee is on me.”

I wasn't sure I liked the way his eyes raked me up and down as he arched a brow. He offered me another soulless smile with too many teeth. “I'm pretty good here, man.”

I nodded, maintaining my smile. “What's your name?” I asked. “I'm Jules.”

His smile curled into a grimace, and I took the hint to back away. The human boy’s expression reminded me of a cornered animal. 

He did the head-tilt thing again, but this time there was a little too much emphasis. 

""I'm sorry, did I fall into an alternate universe where I'm supposed to give strangers my name?"" he demanded.

Jeez, he had mean girl vibes. That’s what Blue called it, anyway. 

When I didn’t, or couldn’t, respond, the boy waved a hand with an eye roll, like I was a stray cat. 

“Bye.” His icy glare followed me, brown eyes not as cozy and warm up close as I’d thought. “Stop stepping on my fuckin’ blanket,” he snapped. 

I detected the slightest accent, like that of a Brit who had lived in the States for most of his life. 

I refused to give up on him. He was an asshole, sure, but he was also vulnerable. He was my second choice, picked from his facial expressions alone. He was so human. That’s what I wanted. 

""Just a coffee,” I said. “You don't have to talk to me. You can sit there, drink it, and then get the fuck out if you want to. But it's raining, and you're soaked, and now I'm soaked, so stop being an *ass* and come inside before I change my mind.” 

I lifted my shoe from where it had been treading on his blanket, twisted around, and walked away. 

About half an hour later, while I was making drinks for the usual crowd of college kids, he appeared like a specter, soaked through, water dripping from his clothes, peering through the door with wide eyes like a startled deer. 

While he squelched his way toward the counter, three customers abandoned their drinks, making a quick exit. 

Instead of making him coffee, I grabbed him, ignoring his, “Woah, hey! *ow!*” and led him upstairs to my tiny apartment above the shop, pressing a towel and a change of clothes into his arms. 

As he opened his mouth to protest, I cut him off with a shake of my head. 

“This is my business,” I hissed, tossing him my bathrobe and shampoo. “You’re not standing there dripping all over my floors.”

He looked like he might argue, before his eagle eyes found Blue’s bath bombs in the pockets of my robe. 

Something sour crept into my throat. I thought I got rid of all her things. 

The guy pulled them out, painfully slowly, cupping them in his hands with a smirk. “Does someone else live here?”

“Not anymore,” I muttered. 

“Oh?” He raised a brow. This guy was childish for his age. “Sooo, like, you were dating someone?”

I shook my head. “She was a friend.”

I turned away from him before I could show any emotion. 

Blue was a hard subject. Leaving him to shower, I returned to my shop. Every customer was gone; their drinks were still lukewarm as I dumped them in the sink. 

He appeared a little later on, hair still damp and fluffy, wearing one of Blue’s sweaters and a scuffed pair of jeans. 

He took an uncertain seat and I made him our special.

Brewed coffee beans, ice-cold milk, and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. 

I noticed him watching me as I worked, chin resting on his fist, head cocked, legs swinging, kind of like a human child. 

“One Bloomshot Brew,” I said, adding extra cream and sliding it across the counter with a smile. 

“Enjoy!”

He stared down at the drink. 

“Uhh, what is it?”

“Coffee.” I deadpanned. 

I watched him take a hesitant sip, and just like that, his walls began to crumble, his expression softening into a smile as he downed the whole thing. 

He wasn't quite happy; I’d say he was more comforted. This boy was constantly on guard, always looking for danger. 

Now, though, I watched his resolve splinter with every sip. The coffee was specifically made to hit every taste bud. 

“Wow,” he said with a surprised laugh. “That’s, uhh, that's actually pretty good.”

He drank the dregs and, just as I thought, met my gaze hopefully. I was already making him another, sliding it over, and he downed the whole thing. 

On his third drink, the boy told me his name, giddy, licking froth from his lips. 

Just a few more, and he'd start talking. 

You see, I designed my coffee with three things in mind. 

I wanted to know names, stories, and get them to just the right amount of comfort. 

“I'm Ronan, by the way,” he said. I made him a fourth coffee, this time our weekend special, Rose and Pine latte. He drank without even questioning it. 

“Jules.” I introduced myself again. “No offence,” I said, leaning forward, copying his demeanor, resting my chin on my fist. 

“But you look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”

Ronan shrugged with a sheepish smile. He was on drink number five. 

Which meant I was close. He sighed, resting his face in his arms. 

“I don't really talk to strangers, but you seem cool,” he lifted his head. 

“So I guess I'm accidentally pouring my life out to you.” He chuckled, but his eyes darkened, gaze dropping to the counter. 

“I lost my parents when I was a kid,” he muttered. “Car crash, or whatever.""

His eyes were suddenly so hollow. 

""I survived, and all I remember is everything being upside down, a red streak of blood across the road—and the radio was still blasting 80s music. We crashed in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside.""

""When they pulled me out of the wreck, I saw my mom’s head on the side of the road, and she was still fucking smiling.”

His smile was faraway, dreamlike, his eyes hollow and vacant, like he'd already given up. Something sour crept up my throat. 

It was familiar. The feeling of drowning but not wanting to resurface. I felt it too. 

I felt it with Mom, and Jun. That's what it was, I thought.  Trauma. The human boy was suffering from *trauma*.

I had only felt trauma, but now I was seeing it in pasty, sunken cheeks, and tired eyes that didn't want to live; didn't *want* to have a soul. 

He straightened up and slid his cup over for a refill. I obliged, though my hands weren't supposed to be shaking as I steamed the milk. Trauma. 

That was the nothing in his eyes, the vacant cavern in his soul, the reason behind his insistence on severing his will to live. I had been through the exact same thing. 

“Anyway, I was adopted, and my adoptive parents were fucking assholes. I wasn't a son, I was a servant. They were crazy. Locked me in my room and refused to feed me.” 

His lip curled. “So, I left and I've been living on the streets ever since.” 

His frown splintered into a slight smile, and I knew that smile. I knew that kind of agony. It was endless. Monotonous. 

A dull, pounding pain wrapped around your bones, and it would never go away. Healed  or not, it would never leave. 

Ronan wore that smile proudly, finishing his seventh coffee. “I have a pretty concrete plan for what I'm going to do.”

The words left my mouth before I could bite them back. 

“You're… going to...” I didn't have to say it. 

He surprised me with a snort. Maybe the drinks were stronger than I thought.

""Well, yeah,"" he laughed. ""It's either so warm I feel like I'm baking, or cold enough to make me wonder if I'll make it through the night. People are judgmental and fucking cruel, and I am so fucking tired. I miss my parents, man. I miss my home.""

He met my gaze, wide brown eyes filling with tears he tried to swipe away with his sleeve. His eyes had lost their voice a long time ago, probably when his parents died. 

I understood. I understood his exhaustion, his willingness to let go. But I had made my choice too. 

Weeks ago, when I first glimpsed him through the window, head tipped back, smiling at the sun with wide, wondrous eyes. 

He was the perfect human, even with his flaws, even with his will to live so weathered, and no matter how hard he tried, I wasn't letting him go. 

Instead of speaking, I poured him another drink. 

Coffee number eight. 

It wasn't actually coffee. I was just making steamed milk. 

He drank the whole thing. 

He shuffled closer, lowering his voice, his warm breath tickling my cheeks. 

""Between you and me?” he murmured. “I'm going to throw myself off the old bridge,"" he scoffed. ""The perfect ending to a sad life.""

“Come work for me,” I said too quickly, my stomach rising into my throat. “I’ve got a spare room in my apartment if you want to crash, and I can offer a decent wage.”

Ronan’s smile was unsurprisingly warm. The coffee was already in his system, lowering his inhibitions.

His pupils were starting to expand. 

“I’m pretty set, man,” he said, leaning over the counter to offer a high five. I hesitated before slapping his palm, and he chuckled, drawing back. 

“Thanks, man. Really. I appreciate you trying to help, but you’re not going to change my mind. I made my choice when I turned eighteen.” 

Ronan dragged his thumb around the rim of his coffee cup, his expression crumpling. 

“I gave myself five years to be happy.” He shrugged, and I wondered if he *wanted* to find that something, but never did. 

That was the reason why the human had given up. 

He sighed. “I mean, I've been happy, sure. But I can’t quite find something worth staying for, y’know?” 

His expression was peaceful, like he was content to walk out of my shop and straight into the path of a truck. He shot me a smile that I knew wasn't a smile. 

It was a goodbye. 

Ronan groaned, his head dropping into his arms. “I want to see my parents again.”

I fought to keep him talking, leaning forward. I was so close. But this was the hardest part. Getting consent. “Ronan.”

The boy didn't move, content with his face buried in his arms. “Mm?”

“I have a spare bed,” I started to say, before a loud clang cut me off. I twisted around to the shelves behind me, filled with brightly colored bell jars. 

One in particular was moving on its own, subtly sliding toward the edge. I picked it up and peered inside. 

From an outsider's perspective, I was holding a jar with a single lightning bug, a flickering light.

But looking closer, the light bled into the shape of a tiny girl floating on her back, eyes closed, dark brown hair billowing around her. 

I gave the jar a violent shake, and the light glowed brighter, bouncing from one side to the other. 

I heard her sharp squeak, before she dropped to the bottom. 

“What's *that*?”

I turned, still holding the jar. 

Ronan was halfway across the counter, wide eyes glued to the jar. 

I tucked her away quickly, ignoring her angry buzzing.

“I collect lightning bugs.”

Ronan rested his chin on his fist, lips curving into a smirk. “Like, fireflies?”

“Kind of.”

He laughed, and it was a good laugh— a real laugh. 

“Dude, how old are you again?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught  her glowing brighter, on purpose, trying to catch his attention. It was working. 

Her light was expanding across the jar, and the human boy was already hypnotized, specks of gold reflecting in his eyes. 

Ronan leaned in, transfixed. “Can I see?” he whispered. 

“I’ve never looked at one this close before.” 

He reached for the jar before I could stop him, pressing his face against the glass. 

There was so much childlike wonder in his eyes, I didn't move to take it off of him. “Whoa,” he breathed, tracing her tiny buzzing light with his finger. 

“Where’d you find it?” 

He gave the jar a gentle shake. This time, she didn’t make a sound, just curled tighter at the bottom, wings folded behind her, head tucked in her arms. 

I snatched it back before he could unscrew the lid and set her free. 

“In the forest,” I said, turning, and placing her back on the shelf. I started to make him his final coffee, but the boy was already standing up and stretching. 

“All right, well, thanks for the coffee and sweater,” he said with a grin. “Can I keep the sweater? It's actually, like, crazy comfortable.”

I nodded, hoping I could keep him talking. But he really was leaving. I even picked up the bell jar to try to catch his attention again, like a moth to a flame. 

But this human was smarter than I thought.

I panicked when he grabbed his backpack, offering me a two-fingered salute. “Can you do me a favor, Jules?”

I found my voice, my chest tight. If I didn't get his consent within the next ten minutes, we were both in trouble. “Ronan—”

“Please don’t follow me. Look, you’re the sweetest guy I’ve ever met, and I’m pretty sure if I wasn’t like this, I’d take you up on your offer.”

He sneezed into his sleeve, and my gut twisted. It was soft, barely even a sneeze. Ronan swiped his nose, rolling his eyes. “Sorry. Allergies, I think.” he settled me with a wide smile that was at peace. 

“Believe me, the worst thing you can do is force me to stay. I said I’m fine, and, funnily enough, I’m actually happier than I’ve ever been.” Ronan reached the door. 

He sneezed again, wrinkling his nose. I noticed him stumble slightly.

I was already moving toward him. I had minutes. “Sounds like you’re getting sick.”

“Yeah.” Ronan sneezed again, this time violently, enough to jerk his body. 

He didn't see the streak of blood on his palm, swiping it on his jeans. 

He met my gaze, and I could already see it, an ignition of gold speckling his iris. “Probably the rain.”

He left the store, sneezing again, spraying blood tinged gold across the glass door. I watched as he stumbled forward. 

Two unsteady steps, swaying left and then right,  before his body gave up, and he hit the concrete face-first. 

His first wail was agonizing. I was paralyzed. I had seen it before, but not like *this*. 

His body was already twisting and contorting, head jerking left to right, bloody chunks spilling from his lips. 

The streets were empty when I pushed open the door. I counted down in my head, my own hands trembling. 

Ronan forced himself upright, but his body was already rejecting human norms, his head hanging, as he choked up slithering red. 

Ronan was the first one I had turned without consent, and if I didn't get it, I would be dealing with a dark fairy, a human turned fae with their consciousness intact, their magic unpredictable and twisted, their soul scorched. 

Dark fairies were the reason my world collapsed, why my family was dead. 

I forced myself to stay calm. The human boy could still be saved with his own words. That's why I chose him. 

But when I reached him, his eyes were unfocused and wrong, glassy, with no reflection. I was wrong about him, I thought dizzily, retrieving a blanket and scooping him into my arms. 

Ronan *did* have a soul. I was selfish and judgemental. 

He sneezed again in my arms, choking up a chunk of his lung. 

Fuck. Lungs meant it was deep enough to begin shaping his heart. 

Ten minutes without consent. 

That’s when the body begins to change as usual. From that point, the clock was ticking. Dark fairies were created from their freedom being stripped away and their inability to choose. 

I managed to carry him back into the shop, just as he screamed, raw, guttural, agonized, His body convulsing so violently that I dropped him. 

His skin was translucent, and I could *see* the change already ripping its way through his body. 

“Ronan,” I whispered, gently stroking his hair. I was feverishly aware of his eyes flickering, a bright yellow hue expanding across his pupils. 

His human soul was burning. I forced him to look at me, grasping his cheeks. He did, his head lolling to one side. 

“You told me you want to die. But what if I offered you a new life?”

""Fuck you,"" he groaned, rolling onto his side. 

The heart came next, slipping from his mouth in wet, slimy tendrils of glistening crimson. His voice was a hoarse cry. ""What did you put in that coffee?""

""Ronan, I'm being serious,"" I hissed, my voice betraying me. ""You have to say yes. That's all you need to say.""

""Get away from me,"" he snarled. ""Get the fuck away from me!""

I held him, cradling his jerking head in my lap. There were two ways I could go. 

With no consent, I could either kill him with raw iron straight through the heart before he could turn, or... I tried one more time, begging him to say a single word. 

It was a verbal contract, a choice he was making. Instead of responding, he spat all over my face.

""Go fuck… yourSELF!""

His words erupted into a screech that sent his body into an arch. I ran out of time.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered in his ear—and I was sorry. It was a method that would usually earn me the death penalty. 

But my species was dead. There was nobody left to punish me. 

The correct way to turn a human was by dosing them over the course of a few hours, which I had done with him. 

Dosing had its limitations. 

It required verbal consent from the human to ensure a mutual turning. 

If a human was turned forcefully, a dark fae was born. 

The alternative, albeit heavily controversial, method was through ingesting fae blood, which stopped the transformation into dark fae. 

I had grown up learning about the dark fae creating armies of changelings through non-consensual turnings. 

Without thinking, I bit into my wrist, ripped it open, and forced it into his mouth. Fae blood was the only thing that could stabilize him. 

""Ronan, please,”  I tried again. “You have to accept it,"" I hissed. But he spat it out, his eyes rolling back to pearly whites. 

When he didn’t respond, I watched his facial structure begin to change, the flesh on his back rippling beneath his shirt. 

His body went still for a moment, limbs slack, head lolling. I shuffled back, knowing what came next. 

Wings burst from bloody flaps of flesh oozing golden light, protruding through his spine. His wings were exactly what I expected: too fragile, like they were made of paper, singed at the edges. 

His hand jerked, and above me, the lights flickered.

The sound of shattering glass barely fazed me as I watched Ronan’s body begin to change. 

Just then, an angry buzzing light hit me in the face. 

I waved her away, and she zipped over to Ronan, glowing brighter as she shifted into a human form, landing gracefully. Her eyes were wide, lips parted. 

Blue knelt beside the boy, cradling his cheeks as blood pooled from his nose and mouth. She shot me a glare, and I sighed. 

""I don't think you want to see this,"" I told her. 

She stayed stubbornly, and I rolled my eyes. ""It's not just a fairy transformation,"" I said, as blood leaked from every orifice. 

He was in the final stage. 

""It's a dark fairy. He didn't consent to be turned, so I can either kill him before he turns, or let him be reborn as—” 

I stopped when Blue tilted her head, blinking at me in confusion. She had no fucking idea what I was talking about.

""Just grab his legs,"" I said, and she did, grasping his ankles. 

His wings reminded me of smoldered glass as they fluttered erratically.

When his skin became too hot to touch, I dropped him just as Blue let out a squeak, stumbling back. 

In the time it took for me to take several steps back, squeezing my eyes shut, something warm and wet hit my face. 

I opened my eyes, and there he was, or *wasn't*. 

Ronan was gone. In his place, shredded human flesh. 

I dropped to my knees next to the human skin, shifted it aside, and plucked out a tiny dim golden light. 

He was limp and covered in blood, his wings like knives cutting my palm. 

When I poked him, he rolled onto his front. I could see his chest moving, hear his bitty breathy gasps.

Blue peered at him, her eyes wide, lips spread into a small smile. 

But she was crying. I picked up a fresh jar, and dropped the boy inside. 

Ronan landed with a *thud*, but he didn't move. 

Fae borns were to be preserved in fairy dust for three days. 

I had no idea what was next for a dark fae. I was in uncharted territory with Ronan. 

I filled the jar, transfixed by the tiny fairy floating, up, up, up, arms dangling, hair haloed around him. 

I screwed the lid on, and gave him a shake for good measure. 

He was perfect. 

Exactly what I imagined. 

What Blue told me, before I took her mind.

Every time you put in a dollar, it stays exactly a dollar. Rain or shine. Ice cream boom or candy crash — doesn’t matter. One dollar in, one dollar out. No surprises. That, my friend, is kind of what a stablecoin is.

Now—pause for dramatic effect—imagine if, instead, you used regular crypto like Bitcoin to buy a lollipop. By the time you unwrap it, the price has either doubled or tanked like a dropped scoop of gelato. Fun? Maybe. Predictable? Nope.

That’s where stablecoins come in like the chill cousin at a chaotic family dinner. Calm. Cool. Collected. Coins like USDT or USDC are *pegged* (fancy word alert) to the U.S. dollar. Which means: 1 USDT ≈ 1 dollar. Like, always. Well… almost always. But let’s not get into economic black holes today.

**So why should you care?**

Well, if you’re sending money, buying crypto, saving for your next overpriced coffee, or trading like a pro — you kinda *want* something that doesn’t change its mind every five seconds. That’s where stablecoins shine. They're like digital dollars, only smarter — and way faster.

Need to swap your stablecoins fast? Quietly? Without leaving your cozy chair or navigating sketchy apps that look like they were built in 2006?

Say hello to [Bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274) — your online crypto exchange that actually makes sense. No fluff. Just a simple, fast way to exchange USDT, USDC and more. Whether you’re in Moscow or just pretending to be from there, it works. No drama.

Look, we’re not gonna write poetry about stablecoins (unless you want us to — we *could*). But if you’re dealing with crypto, you’ll want something *solid*. Something that doesn’t vanish into a puff of volatility. That’s what stablecoins are for.

It was only a month after I retired that my wife and I had separated from our twenty-three years of marriage, and my now ex-wife, Monica, would tell anybody else that the fault was mine. After retiring at the top of the detective class, a title I held true for fifteen years, we tried to start a family. Unfortunately, after not having any luck, Monica went to see a doctor and found out about her infertility. The following week, I came home after grocery shopping in the morning, and she was gone. All that had been left behind was a note in which she called me selfish and blamed me for the failure of our marriage. The divorce papers were served the following Friday afternoon. I was watching TV when the doorbell rang; I clicked the TV off and answered the door to a young kid who smelled of weed and cheeseburgers. 

""Here ya go, sir, you have been served."" 

Besides my life coming down harder than the Roman Empire, I would say it's been simple. 

July 23, 2032

Today, I woke up in a better mood and took my dog, Ranger, out for a walk. Ranger was a dog I had given Monica as an anniversary present; Ranger was more of a gift for me since Monica had something against dogs. When Ranger and I walked home, the mail courier left my porch. 

""Good afternoon, sir; it's good that you showed up so I can deliver your package. Stay safe and have a good day."" 

He handed the package to me, and in a split second, his eyes caught mine, and I noticed an eerie, wide smile across his face. Although before I was able to say anything else, he walked up to his mail truck and drove away. Once inside, I set the package on the coffee table and made dinner. Monica cooked a lot of the time, but I was no stranger to the stove. After I ate, I sat on the couch with a cold beer and watched the news. 

8:46 pm 

It did not take long for the package to catch my attention again; the box was unorthodox, and it seemed to be wrapped almost as if it were a gift. The cardboard box was wrapped in brown paper and tied closed with butcher's twine. The post label only had my name and mailing address, but no return address. I decided to open it because, in my eyes, I had nothing else to lose. I got up, grabbed scissors from the kitchen drawer, and snipped it open. A small, square box, its white surface reflecting the light above me, contained a cassette tape with a note inside. The tape was labeled with a permanent red marker, 

""Bygones."" 

The sight of the tape left me wondering what all this could mean. I could not help but feel like a thousand eyes were staring at me from the inside. Then I remembered the Walkman Monica left behind; she said it was half-broken but still played tapes decently.
I had practically torn the house up looking for it, but I popped it in and started the tape once I found it. 

""Hello Jonathan, long time no talk, I wouldn't expect you to know me by my voice, but I just wanted to make contact. Ten years ago, you ran into your first wall as a detective with my case, the bombing of the metro train station. Twelve people: five adults, three kids, and four elderly. All died in vain because you couldn't do your job right, and the press wrote me off as dead just because you couldn't figure out who I was. So because of all this, their blood stains your hands to this very day. If you want to make things right, meet me at the address on the back of the note, and there you shall be executed for your crimes against the ones you swore to protect."" 

I took off the headphones and walked to the kitchen, staggering for balance, my heart thumping against my chest, it echoed in my silence. I picked up a new beer bottle, opened it, and chugged it to finish. The only mistake in my career has come back to haunt me, and my world is crumbling. The retirement that bores me, my wife leaving me because I'm unable to satisfy her, and now the one who got away wants to see me meet my end. Although I do not think they were counting on me having nothing to lose, and with this, I will make my own end. The note was in the white box; it had been a sticky note with a location and time: 

""WEST SHIPYARD 8 O'CLOCK; COME ALONE."" 

The bottom script provided me with a date for the meeting, and I prepared accordingly.

My friends would sleep till noon, wake up to cartoons and cereal. Meanwhile, my dad would be banging on our doors at 6:45AM like we were late for basic training.

“Up. Let’s go. Time doesn’t wait.”

No excuses. Rain or shine, we were either raking leaves, fixing something, or getting dragged to hardware stores before most people had even brewed coffee.

I hated it. I thought he was just obsessed with discipline, or maybe allergic to fun. I'd always ask, “Why can’t we just sleep in like normal families?” His answer never changed:

“Own your mornings, and the rest of the day will follow.”

It sounded like one of those phrases dads repeat just because *they* heard it from *their* dads.

Fast forward to adulthood. I had full control of my life, and I used it to sleep in every weekend. Until one day I woke up late, rushed, missed an important meeting, and spent the rest of the day playing catch-up. I felt behind, foggy, and frustrated. It wasn’t just one bad day, it kept happening.

So one Saturday, for no real reason, I got out of bed early. Made real breakfast. Took a walk. Planned my day instead of reacting to it. It felt… calm. Like I was in charge of time instead of constantly chasing it.

It became a habit. And it changed everything, my focus, my energy, even my mood.

One morning, as I poured coffee before sunrise, I caught myself whispering, “Own your mornings...” and laughed. I finally got it.

My dad wasn’t just making us wake up early. He was teaching us something deeper:  
**Discipline isn’t about control, it’s about freedom.**

I texted him that day:  
“You were right. I didn’t get it then, but I do now.”

All he sent back was: “Took you long enough 😄”

1m6309w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CalligrapherDue4835/comments/1m6309w/automatic_coffee_machines_effortless_brewing_for/,Automatic Coffee Machines: Effortless Brewing for Home and Office,"Automatic coffee machines have transformed the coffee-making experience, bringing barista-level brews into kitchens and workplaces with the push of a button. Whether you crave the precision of espresso, the smoothness of a cappuccino, or the comfort of black coffee, these machines offer versatility, consistency, and convenience—all without the need for manual grinding or frothing.

# What Is an Automatic Coffee Machine?

An automatic coffee machine is designed to perform the entire coffee-making process with minimal user intervention. Unlike manual espresso machines, these appliances grind beans, extract espresso, and often froth milk automatically. Some models are fully automatic (bean-to-cup), while others are semi-automatic, giving users some control over the brewing steps.

# Key Features and Benefits

**1. One-Touch Operation:** Most automatic coffee machines allow users to select their favorite drink—like latte, espresso, or macchiato—with a single button. This is ideal for busy mornings or multitasking environments.

**2. Integrated Grinders:** These machines typically include built-in burr grinders, ensuring every brew starts with freshly ground beans. This significantly enhances flavor and aroma.

**3. Milk Frothing Systems:** Higher-end models come with automatic milk frothers or carafes. Some allow customization of froth level and temperature for various milk-based drinks.

**4. Customization:** Many machines let users adjust grind size, coffee strength, temperature, and volume, tailoring each cup to individual taste.

**5. Compact Design:** Automatic machines are increasingly space-efficient, with sleek profiles that fit modern kitchen counters and office pantries.

**6. Easy Maintenance:** Features like self-cleaning cycles, removable drip trays, and descaling alerts simplify upkeep and prolong machine lifespan.

# Who Should Use One?

**Home Users:** If you're a coffee enthusiast looking for café-style drinks at home without the effort of manual brewing, an automatic machine is a great investment.

**Offices:** These machines are perfect for workplaces where staff need quick, consistent coffee with minimal downtime. Some models are designed for high-volume usage.

**Hotels & Hospitality:** Automatic coffee makers can elevate guest experience with self-service espresso bars in rooms or lobbies.

**Small Cafés or Bistros:** Startups or compact food businesses can benefit from entry-level professional automatic machines that balance quality with speed.

# Top Considerations Before Buying

* **Budget:** Automatic machines range from budget-friendly to premium. Prices depend on brand, build quality, and included features.
* **Drink Variety:** Ensure the model supports your preferred beverages.
* **Water and Bean Capacity:** Choose larger capacities for high-use scenarios.
* **User Interface:** Look for touchscreen panels or clearly labeled buttons for easy navigation.
* **Brand Reputation:** Brands like DeLonghi, Jura, Philips, and Breville offer proven reliability.

# Final Thoughts

An [automatic coffee machine](https://latteholic.com/) can significantly upgrade your coffee routine, blending automation with premium quality. It's the perfect solution for those who want great-tasting coffee without the barista skill set. With a wide variety of models and features, there’s an option for every lifestyle and budget. Whether for home indulgence or workplace efficiency, an automatic coffee machine is a smart, satisfying choice for modern coffee lovers.",1,1753153233.0,u_CalligrapherDue4835,0,1.0,False

ive been vegetarian for around two years now, but i wanted to go vegan mainly for the animals and the cruelty they face, but also for my own health. i’ve been doing a lot of research and ive learned how veganism can do a whole 180 on a persons health, including fixing their gut biome and weight loss. 

i was in hyvee today (i don’t normally shop there but i wanted to try vegan cream cheese for a recipe) and i was blown away by all of the plant based dairy and egg alternatives! literally anything you could think of has an alternative - sour cream, yogurt, spinach artichoke dip and sour cream and onion dip, cheese sticks, even kraft now has a vegan mac n cheese, there’s so much! now to me, this sounds great, however, i wonder if this may actually be counterintuitive to a vegan diet. i’ve heard some people say that those dairy alternatives have bad ingredients in them, so if you’re vegan it’s better to just cut dairy and eggs completely from your diet instead of eating the “fake” stuff. however, plant based milks are extremely popular even to non vegans, you can find oat milk in any coffee shop, so what’s the difference?

1m62ylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1m62ylp/trying_to_call_out_of_work_without_getting_in/,Trying to call out of work without getting in trouble,"I recently started working at a coffee house that was better than the previous one I worked at. I have worked at one for 4 years and decided to transition to a new store that opened up, because they provided benefits and had better opportunities overall. However this new store is a lot more strict, and while I’m trying to adjust to the stricter policies and be a good worker, I’ve been having a rough start that has been making it difficult and portraying me in a bad light.

Unfortunately there is one particular person who I don’t have good standing with, because every time I see her, she points out something about me that is wrong and always seems like there is some kind of issue. 

For some context on why I’m stressed about calling out- I had recently cut my hours to two days a week for a whole month because my long distant boyfriend was visiting me. Yesterday he had to leave back home, but unfortunately I was scheduled to work before he had to leave. I wanted to see him off and say my goodbyes, so I asked the manager if I could come into work at a later time. Approximately two hours later because I didn’t want to call out. I had given her a short rundown on why, and asked her early morning, hours before my shift to give her plenty of time to think on it. She told me to ask two people that were already working if they could stay until 5-5:30 to cover my absence, and if they can’t, I would have to come in around 3:45 (my shift was 2:30) and ask my shift supervisor (the person I’m having troubles with) to see if she’s okay with it. 

So I did exactly that. However, I felt no one would be willing to stay until 5, so I asked both people if they could stay until at least 4. Only one got back to me saying they were there until 4:30 and will see me later. So I figured that worked out and was settled. 8 min after my shift was suppose to start, my shift supervisor starts texting me asking me where I am, and that I’m suppose to call the store if I’m running late. I apologized for not texting her about my situation, and explained that I was coming in later and why. She started interrogating me asking if this was okay with my manager, who I asked, if they agreed, and if she knows. I told her everything that was said to me, and she told me to come in as soon as possible because the girl I had asked to cover was already scheduled until 4:30 so its not considered a coverage. I was upset about it clearly, but I had no choice, so I wasn’t able to properly say goodbye to my bf, and went into work. I got in trouble for it, and was told my manager was gonna have a talk with me about it, which in their words is mostly likely a write up.

Now after all that tension from yesterday, I had just saw that I was scheduled on a day thats not within my availability. I work weekends and Mondays and Tuesdays, and give myself 3 consecutive days off. They scheduled me on a Thursday for a store meeting, which unfortunately I can’t attend because I’m going on a family trip in which I wont be back until Friday. 

I need to call off, but I don’t know how to approach it. I wanted to send a message to my manager explaining the issue as to why I can’t show up for that shift, but my family is telling me not to and to just call out sick the day of. They believe that after everything thats been happening in the work place and all the trouble I’ve been getting into, that trying to explain anything to my superiors is futile and they will just see me as a flake. However I like to be as transparent as possible just so I don’t appear that way.

gotta get this off my chest it's driving me nuts. my abusive on again off again bf of 3 years sprained my hand last Friday yelling at me and throwing me into a closet which i was terrified and called the cops.

 for context he has assaulted me many times before  even going so far as to break my collarbone a couple of years ago (throwing me into a wall..) and leaving me with a permanent scar on my face last december from throwing a curtain rod at me where it sliced open under my eye. every situation fluctuated between him being semi remorseful then just essentially saying i deserved it or insisting i had hit him first though he's always unscathed 

he also has an assault by choking charge from january against his ex (he lived with her and lied to me about it while dating both of us for 3 years) when he kicked her out of his house, and another in may from him punching a cab driver. i wasn't there to see what happened either time but he can be drunk and belligerent and that's usually the case

in any case the cops charged him with assault on me too and went and locked him up and now he's in pretrial jail. i hate the mix of emotions like the waves of guilt or like i did something wrong because this isn't even the most severely he's hurt me. but he's choked me many times too including a couple of weeks ago while we were meant to be on a trip together and he ditched me in his hometown 6hrs away with no place to stay so i sat up all night in a coffee shop until i could get a bus back 

so anyway if anyone has words of encouragement that would be rad and sorry for being a downer i just don't know what to feel at alllll. he knew he was on thin ice with the law after the cab driver though and is still aggressive and scary/violent and regularly expressed wanting to fight or hurt others he wouldn't have stopped :(",3,1753153043.0,abusiverelationships,6,1.0,False

By the fire of the longhouse, in the ninth year of Óðinn’s moon, 2025...

In the twilight of spring, as the sun dipped low behind the fjord-cut skyline, the people of Valtýrstad prepared for the Ninth Night. Skalds chalked bindrunes on the walls of coffee houses. Motorbikes rumbled past statues of Thor and Freyja, their riders clad not in chrome studded leather, but in wolf pelts and woven cloaks. Even in the heart of the modern city, gods were everywhere: etched in steel, reflected in glass, whispered in alleyways.

On the edge of the city stood a longhouse that hummed with electric warmth and old magic. Cedar smoke curled from its chimney. Inside, a child named Sigrún sat with her grandfather, a goði with silver braids and storm grey eyes. Tonight, she would take her first climb. Tonight, she would seek her hamr.

“Do you know why we do this?” her grandfather asked, adjusting the runes on her cloak.

Sigrún nodded. “Because we are not just skin and name. We are shadow and echo. We are more than we seem.”

He smiled. “Good. Then you’re ready.”

Outside, the streets had quieted. On the Ninth Night, no one worked, no one traded. The government, such as it was, paused. Even the sky respected the silence. It was the one night when all honored the crossing: between who you are and who you are meant to be.

Sigrún joined the others at the foot of the mountain. Her classmates. Her rival. Her brother. Each wore a cloak marked by their clan’s rune. No two were the same. Drums began to beat from above; soft, steady, ancestral. A path of flame lit stones led upward.

They climbed.

At the summit stood the vé, the sacred space. No walls. Just open air, stone pillars, and the bones of memory. The goðar encircled the youth. A völva stood at the center, her staff carved from lightning-struck ash.

“Step forward,” she called.

One by one, the young did. Each spoke their heiti, the name they claimed. Not the one given by their parents, but the one earned by spirit. “Sigrún úlfrblóð.” Sigrún of the wolf-blood.

The völva nodded. “Tonight, your hamr will walk.”

The youth knelt. The drums shifted. The chanting began, not in English, not in Nynorsk, but in the Old Tongue. The rhythm seeped into Sigrún’s bones. Her breath slowed. Her skin prickled. And then...

She was no longer kneeling.

She was running.

Through forest, moonlit and silver. Her body low, her paws silent. She knew every scent. She heard the heartbeat of mice underground. She leapt between stones like wind given form. She was not human. She was not other. She was wolf.

And then, she howled.

Not in fear. Not in rage. But in joy.

Below, the city pulsed with ritual. Families gathered around altars of stone and steel. Drones passed overhead, filming for the great moot broadcast. Atop skyscrapers, rune-priests poured mead into rooftop bowls. Freyr’s gardens bloomed on balconies. Freyja’s cats curled on digital hearths. Thor’s hammers hung in truck windows and subway stations. No one forgot the gods, they lived among them.

In schools, children learned Old Norse beside math and science. They recited Hávamál with as much fluency as Shakespeare. Runes were as common as alphabets. Magic was not hidden, it was regulated, respected, recorded.

Hospitals employed völur to sing healing over the dying. Police bore carved staves to ward off vengeful spirits. Soldiers trained in combat and in prophecy. Politicians swore oaths on oath rings, and breaking one meant exile, not reelection.

This was not a utopia. There was still struggle. Still greed, still pain. But there was balance. There was memory. The old ways had not been lost. They had grown roots in concrete and glass.

When Sigrún awoke, she lay in her grandfather’s arms.

“Did you find it?” he whispered.

She nodded, tears streaking her ash stained cheeks. “I was not alone.”

He smiled, and lifted her up to face the stars.

“Then you are truly among us now. A daughter of wolves. A keeper of the Old Flame.”

And somewhere, beyond the fjord and the neon skyline, a chorus of howls answered; soft, strong, eternal.

Not in mourning.

TW graphic details, transphoba

I am a transgender man. In the past year, I have been raped/assaulted by 2 transgender women, who were close friends of mine, as well as been repeatedly sexually harassed. I feel like an awful person for even saying this out loud. I love each and every one of my trans siblings, but i find myself lately having an avoidance to trans women, and I think I may be a horrible person. 

The first time was my girlfriend of 5 years. We were taking a shower in the morning, and she started to touch me, which was fine and normal. Then she started groping me, I laughed and said I wasn't really in the mood. She spun me around and penetrated me, multiple times I pulled her off and said ""stop"" or ""I'm done"", but she just grabbed me and held me against the shower and continued. At some point she stopped after I had asked at least ten times. I left the shower then and sat on the bed, and asked dissociated for hours in silence. Later that day, I asked if she had heard me asking her to stop. She just shrugged and said ""yeah"" and walked off. 

The second time was a close friend of mine. We had hooked up twice before, I struggle with boundaries (clearly), but I've been crystal clear with her that I was in a bad place and wanted to remain celibate. We had a bad night out with other friends, and I didn't end up bringing her back home until about 3am. She said I could crash at hers, and I was vocal about being hesitant because I didn't want to have sex. She assured me it would be fine.

I was falling asleep and rubbing her arm, then she came onto me and starting rubbing in between my legs. I told her I didnt want to have sex, but she continued anyway, and I should have done more to stop her but I was on 48 straight hours of no sleep. We had sex, and a couple times I said again I didnt want to but eventually just gave up. At one point she said she liked how tight I was because I was scared. 

I stopped going to one of the only trans meetups in my town, at a coffee shop. There is a lot of discourse and im really the only trans guy and whatnot, but on multiple occasions trans women have come up to me asking about my chest size. Twice a girl has grabbed my crotch unprompted ""to see if you had a dick or not"". I've gotten so many comments about my bra size and having a ""bonus hole"". 

I'm just at the point where I am so massively uncomfortable around women and I feel so, so guilty. I think im doing something wrong for this to keep happening but im not sure what. I know it's just my small range of experience, and I don't ever ever want to subconsciously assign such horrible thoughts to people, but I am wary and scared, and I think I'm a horrible person. I feel so disgusting in my body.

Not because I wanted to sound smart at parties. My college roommate (philosophy major) told me that's what the ancient Stoics did they read every morning to train their minds. Idk if that was even true.

**How to Start (If You Haven't Read a Book Since High School):**

* Pick something you're genuinely curious about. Not what you think you ""should"" read. Curious about money? Read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Into psychology? Try ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" Love stories? Pick up fiction that actually makes you think.
* Start with 10 pages. Not 50. Not ""I'll read for an hour."" Just 10 pages. Every morning. Before you touch your phone just read.
* Physical books only (at least at first). Your phone has trained you to skim and jump around. Books train you to go deep.
* Keep it visible. Put the book next to your bed. On your coffee table. Make it easier to grab than your phone.

Your attention span gets longer. Your thoughts get clearer. You start seeing patterns everywhere because you're feeding your brain actual substance instead of digital candy.

**But here's where people screw it up:**

1. They try it once, get bored, and quit. Yeah no shit it feels slow at first. Your brain is used to getting dopamine hits every 3 seconds. It's supposed to feel weird. Give it two weeks. Minimum.
2. They ease into it. Start with audiobooks or short articles. Nope. Pick up a real book. Physical pages. Make your brain do the work. Get the real effect of focused, sustained attention.
3. They treat it like homework. It's not a chore. It's mental strength training. Don't just ""get through pages"" lean into the ideas. Make it a daily win.

After 4 years:

* My attention span went from goldfish to laser-focused
* I stopped falling for clickbait and surface-level thinking
* Conversations got deeper because I had actual thoughts, not just reactions
* Problems started looking like puzzles instead of disasters
* I became the guy people come to for advice

Still reading. Still sometimes feels like work. Still doing it. I think it's flipped my relationship with discipline, because in the end, not being disciplined means you stop once it requires effort.

Try it tomorrow. No thinking. Just grab a book and read 10 pages. Let me know how it hits your brain differently than scrolling. And start with something you're actually interested in curiosity beats discipline.

So, I am great at problem solving and thinking on my feet (from what others have told me). I live with diagnoses that, while negatively impacting other parts of my life, help me remain calm and composed in situations where most people around me would start to unravel. People often describe me as ""unflappable"", I would use it as an icebreaker adjective if my name started with u as well.

Last week, I was talking to a friend and mentioned how my Monday had started terribly. I slept through my alarm, was running late for the second week at my new job, and didn't have time to grab breakfast (or even coffee). This friend has known me for a while, and they are aware of how religiously I follow my routines. Still, I was able to think on my feet and time things perfectly, so I could have breakfast before setting foot in my office with next to no disruption to the rest of my routine. Their response to it got me thinking about how I have been able to think on my feet to creatively solve other problems too, not just my own, but also problems of people around me.

That makes me think, there are people around me who freeze and get stuck on problems for a plethora of reasons. I am not referring to significant issues like debt or health. I am referring to minor inconveniences that disrupt people's flow and the norm they have established for themselves, ultimately derailing the rest of their day. So, what if I were to launch something to help people get their days back on track, or otherwise minimise the impact these inconveniences have on their lives? Something similar to Be My Eyes (the Danish app for visually impaired folks)? Is this something y'all think there is a market for?

[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalisdaradvisor/)Tax Advisor | Business Advisor/ Taxation Expertise/ Enrolled Agent (EA)/Master of Science in Taxation (MST)/ AuthorJuly 22, 2025

I came across a news article from the BBC that caught my attention: “An air force jet has crashed in Bangladesh,” resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people and injuring over 170 others. The incident occurred when a training jet from the Bangladeshi Air Force crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, the capital. The armed forces issued a statement on Facebook saying that the F-7 jet experienced mechanical failure shortly after taking off for a training mission around 1:00 PM local time (07:06 GMT) on Monday. Sadly, the pilot was among those who died.

I then turned to YouTube to find videos related to this incident and to hear comments from Bengalis about the situation. Honestly, I think Bangladesh is becoming increasingly embarrassing. I’ve met many Bengalis in NYC who feel Bangladesh is a joke and a place for looting, and they believe that Western Europe and American masters will send foreign aid to Bangladesh, allowing them to exploit those resources. Some call it a recycling of money, which flows from Western Europe and America, and then they use it to buy houses, cars, and start businesses in Western Europe and America.

They often don’t understand the complexities involved in forming a strategic foreign policy. Interestingly, Bengalis’ Father Mujib, who openly admitted to begging for financial help from the world to support Bangladesh, suggests that some Bengalis stole such funds.

**Bangladesh Military**

My father advised General Osmani to form a professional military before the Indian withdrawal on March 14, 1972, but Sheikh Mujibur Rahman opposed this, claiming, ""We have no enemy; we do not need an army,"" and instead proposed creating Rakkhi Bahini for civil defense. After setting up Bangladesh’s military, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi discussed with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emphasized the need to build a military to appease the Razakars and support national security.

Bangladesh’s armed forces—Army, Navy, Air Force, and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR)—trace their roots back to remnants of the Pakistani military, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, as well as East Pakistan Rangers and Razakars. Many believe all Mukti Bahini members joined the new military, but in reality, the group was diverse, and many members faced severe losses during coups, counter-coups, courts-martial, and gang conflicts, which complicated nation-building.

Different leaders envisioned the military’s future differently: Serajul Alam Khan supported Gonobahini, Khaled Mosharraf favored a Confederate Army, and Colonel Taher pushed for a Red Army. These divisions reflected internal conflicts, and none of these leaders were solely focused on Bengali nationalism.

**Bangladesh Air Force**

I heard that MAG Osmani had a conversation with my father at a coffee table where he asked how we would build an Air Force, considering we had nothing left after the Indian military took everything as war booty. My father recalled that Valentin Popov, the Soviet Union's Ambassador to Bangladesh, was the first high-ranking official to visit the country. He advised MAG Osmani to say nothing and just observe what Valentin Popov was doing. My father suggested that Popov might believe the Purbo Banglar Communist Party would declare communism, and he would try to support Mujib to avoid any problems or another war with communists. He noted that the Soviet Union would probably help Bangladesh support a communist revolution.

My father’s prediction came true when, in November–December 1972, the Bangladesh Air Force received a large donation from the Soviet Union. Among the aircraft delivered were ten single-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs, two twin-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21UMs, and twelve Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters. Later, China also supplied some equipment. This marked the start of the Bangladesh Air Force.

**Nation of Thieves**

I have consistently advised and taught some Bangladesh ministers how to build foreign relationships and develop the country. I recommended creating institutions that improve quality of life by fostering good governance and improving infrastructure in Bangladesh; however, instead of developing, they loot the country.

During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s time in office, about 240 billion dollars were stolen from Bangladesh. A committee formed by interim leader Muhammad Yunus revealed concerning findings about the country’s finances. According to the committee, it’s estimated that an average of $16 billion may have been illegally taken out of Bangladesh each year during Hasina’s 15-year rule.

The panel, led by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya, submitted a white paper on Bangladesh's economy to Dr. Yunus, as announced by the government.

Her and her partner had a bachelor/bachlorette trip where the wedding party spent a weekend together at a cabin. It was a lot of fun. I knew and had met all of the bridal party except one of the groomsmen. Going into the trip I was told I was one of 3 single people. Me, the brother of the groom, and the groomsmen I hadn’t met. So, the entire trip there was a flirty vibe between me and the groomsmen I hadn’t met. Touches, closeness in proximity, sharing drinks, teasing, etc. The last night we were at the cabin we went to a bar then came back to the cabin to hang out. At the bar, he talked about his ex girlfriend from like a year ago and how he was single, and blah blah blah. Anyways when we got back It was late. I layed on the floor under the coffee table where the groomsmen’s legs were because it shaded the light. He kept nudging me with his foot. Eventually I got up and sat on the couch next to him and grabbed a blanket. He grabbed the blanket to share it with me. There was cuddling and touching, and handholding, and a handjob. Then everyone went to bed and he told me to wait. I did. I ended up giving him a blowjob in the bathroom…not my best moment. It was the first blowjob I’ve given. He wanted to do more but I said no. Anyways then I went to bed. Next day was awkward. We went home. I messaged him and asked “so a one time thing or…?” because there was a vibe literally all weekend. He said “ I think so Im sorry, no disrespect I am just not ready for anything yet.” I said okay and let it go. I was bummed because I thought he was handsome and a cool funny guy and I romanticized things in my brain. A few weeks later I was talking to one of his friends and long story short his friend told me that the groomsmen has had a girlfriend for over a year. I messaged the groomsmen and asked him and I said “you have had a girlfriend for a while?” and he said not until recently. I asked how recently, like after the trip recently, and he said “ya not officially until recently.” I think he is lying and I feel really shitty about it. I know it is shitty but I am not going to tell his girlfriend. Even if I wanted to, I don't know who she is. On top of it all I am probably going to have to walk down the aisle with him at my sisters wedding in a few months. I am just bummed and disappointed and I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I don’t want anyone in my real life to know because I am embarrassed and feel ashamed. It is also silly because I had a crush on him, until I found out he had a girlfriend. Like a good ole fashioned elementary school style crush. I hadn’t had one of those in a while, so idk the whole situation is just kind of disappointing.  I will get over it in time, and after the wedding I probably won't see him ever again anyways.

1m62j98,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m62j98/he_had_a_girlfiend/,He had a girlfiend.,"My sister is getting married in a few months. Her and her partner had a bachelor/bachlorette trip where the wedding party spent a weekend together at a cabin. It was a lot of fun. I knew and had met all of the bridal party except one of the groomsmen. Going into the trip I was told I was one of 3 single people. Me, the brother of the groom, and the groomsmen I hadn’t met. So, the entire trip there was a flirty vibe between me and the groomsmen I hadn’t met. Touches, closeness in proximity, sharing drinks, teasing, etc. The last night we were at the cabin we went to a bar then came back to the cabin to hang out. At the bar, he talked about his ex girlfriend from like a year ago and how he was single, and blah blah blah. Anyways when we got back It was late. I layed on the floor under the coffee table where the groomsmen’s legs were because it shaded the light. He kept nudging me with his foot. Eventually I got up and sat on the couch next to him and grabbed a blanket. He grabbed the blanket to share it with me. There was cuddling and touching, and handholding, and a handjob. Then everyone went to bed and he told me to wait. I did. I ended up giving him a blowjob in the bathroom…not my best moment. It was the first blowjob I’ve given. He wanted to do more but I said no. Anyways then I went to bed. Next day was awkward. We went home. I messaged him and asked “so a one time thing or…?” because there was a vibe literally all weekend. He said “ I think so Im sorry, no disrespect I am just not ready for anything yet.” I said okay and let it go. I was bummed because I thought he was handsome and a cool funny guy and I romanticized things in my brain. A few weeks later I was talking to one of his friends and long story short his friend told me that the groomsmen has had a girlfriend for over a year. I messaged the groomsmen and asked him and I said “you have had a girlfriend for a while?” and he said not until recently. I asked how recently, like after the trip recently, and he said “ya not officially until recently.” I think he is lying and I feel really shitty about it. I know it is shitty but I am not going to tell his girlfriend. Even if I wanted to, I don't know who she is. On top of it all I am probably going to have to walk down the aisle with him at my sisters wedding in a few months. I am just bummed and disappointed and I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I don’t want anyone in my real life to know because I am embarrassed and feel ashamed. It is also silly because I had a crush on him, until I found out he had a girlfriend. Like a good ole fashioned elementary school style crush. I hadn’t had one of those in a while, so idk the whole situation is just kind of disappointing.  I will get over it in time, and after the wedding I probably won't see him ever again anyways. Just bummer.

1m62j8t,https://i.redd.it/jdv7kzvg1cef1.jpeg,The Toasted Marshmallow Coffee Syrup Hooch (it tastes like burning),"A friend gave me a bottle of Da Vinci Toasted Marshmallow coffee syrup. It tasted like burned coconut (not marshmallows, strangely), and it had both potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate in it. I diluted it with water to make a half-gallon, and boiled it on the stove for a bit in an attempt to destroy some of the preservatives. I usually dry-pitch, but this time I actually bothered starting the 1118, because I knew it was gonna need all the help it could get. It also got a dash of DAP to help it along.

Fermentation was not exactly vigorous, but the 1118 still managed 5.8% ABV in two weeks. That was the only good news.

The hooch was awful. That shit went right proper acrid. Tasting notes included Harbor Freight tools and burning powder coat.

I distilled it, hoping the flavor would stay behind. It did not. I now have about a pint of perfectly clear 43% ABV rotgut that tastes like a toasted marshmallow jelly bean wrapped in an electrical fire. 

So, yeah. Garbage in, garbage out. But now I know that 1118 can eat this garbage, I'll have to keep an eye out for a less-wretched flavor of it on the clearance rack.

1m62gnb,https://i.redd.it/3vv31xzu7cef1.jpeg,First PourOver,"I entered the coffee grind space with an AeroPress! I feel like I was finally able to find what worked with it (using a medium-dark roast) but I wanted to try percolation and see how it differs to immersion. So I went with the Hario Pegasus since it's good for beginners to learn the technique. I went with size 3 because I usually drink 355 mls at a time, but also make some for my fiancee too, so I could easily go with 700mls.....also because the size 02 cafec trapezoid are on backorder until October....
