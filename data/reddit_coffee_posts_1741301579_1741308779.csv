*No Coffee after Vyvance:*

Close to a year and a half ago I started vyvance. For the first 6 months of taking vyvance it worked wonderfully with no issues. During that time I didn’t drink coffee for different reasons and instead had decafe coffee bc I liked the taste of it. After 6 months I started to drink coffee again and all of a sudden started experiencing crashes with my vyvanse. Overstimulated easily, headache, tired, and irritable. I didn’t realize at the time about the connection to coffee, bc if I had coffee an hour or two before vyvance it wasn’t a problem but if I had it after vyvance I would crash, and this was too much for me to process at the time. Reddit suggested Wellbutrin bc it would help with the crashes but…

*I needed Rexulti bc without it, Vyvanse made me tired/wouldn’t work at all:*

My NP switched me off rexulti around 7 months ago bc I wanted to try Wellbutrin and she wanted me to stay on cipralex. As soon as I stopped rexulti and started Wellbutrin I became really lethargic all the time and i felt even more tired when I had vyvance or coffee which was so weird to me. I assumed it was Wellbutrin making me tired so went back to just cipralex but was still the same. I remembered that before I started rexulti (about 4 years previous) I was constantly tired and depressed when non medicated like I was feeling again (now suspect at base level I might have bipolar 2 disorder). I realized the rexulti is what helped my vyvanse actually work/maybe activate properly and as long as I have rexulti and no coffee after vyvanse it works perfectly.

1j5b07t,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1j5b07t/review_co404_medellín_give_it_six_months_before/,Review: Co.404 Medellín  - Give it six months before considering,"In February I stayed for two weeks in the new Co.404 in Laureles Medellín. I'd heard really good things about Co.404 in Oaxaca and having been to Medellín before, I was keen to visit again (although twice is enough now in my book!).

As it only opened at the end of 2024 I couldn't find any reviews online but it had some good reviews on Google Maps and the brand was strong when I asked other people about Co.404 whilst on the road.

But...

In short, I was pretty disappointed - it's more hostel than co-living and the place is unfinished in some places and ""couldn't be arsed"" in others. The kitchen is well-equipped, and events are well-run, but poor ventilation, a shoddy co-working space and lax security policies make it hard to justify for long-term stays. If you’re looking for a hostel with fast internet and a built-in social scene, it does the job. But if you're after a proper co-living and working experience, this isn’t it, not yet anyway.

# Pricing

I paid £500 for two weeks (\~£35/night) for their ""Private Ensuite Bathroom"" which is the larger more expensive option. Monthly stays are much better value and there are options from a dorm room up to a private ensuite.

# Location & Accessibility

Laureles is one of the better neighbourhoods in Medellín, offering a more liveable, affordable and authentic alternative to El Poblado. There's a well-stocked tienda next door, a decent laundromat 5 mins away and a handful of supermarkets within a 15-minute walk. There are also plenty of cafés and restaurants within a 15-min radius.

# Accommodation & Comfort

Rooms are spacious, and the beds are comfortable, but poor design choices make them frustrating to live in. The rooms are all internal, so your only window looks out into a corridor and the room opposite you. The lack of privacy is also a major issue: windows don’t close properly and the transom window above the door has no glass, so it's a six-inch gap above your door, completely negating any sound-proofing and privacy. Coupled with the lack of ventilation, my room was often damp and plaster was repeatedly falling from the ceiling.

# Kitchen

Really nice and spacious kitchen; well-equipped, plenty of storage and a massive communal dining area. Each guest gets a fridge box (a bit small) and dry storage cubby (plentiful), and tap water is drinkable. There’s also freshly brewed coffee every morning. Though some guests leave dirty dishes lying around and staff didn't kick people up the arse for it.

# Connectivity

The Wi-Fi is really decent, with a strong connection throughout the building and zero dropouts. I did a few tests throughout my stay, and on average, I got 120mbps down and 85mbps up. I forgot to note down the ping, but I had loads of video calls throughout my stay, during peak hours, and had no issues.

# Co-Working Environment

Coupled with the rooms, this was the biggest letdown. It looks great in photos but is unfinished and impractical. The seating is awful, with only one adjustable office chair in the entire room and the rest are unadjustable wooden chairs or crappy stools. The desks have also been built slightly too high by about an inch, which makes for really uncomfortable posture. Half the space has no lighting, making it unusable after dark, and the lack of blinds means some desks are unusable in the morning due to direct sun glare. With more guests than available desks, this space simply isn’t viable for proper co-working and at full capacity it'll be a nightmare.

# Social Atmosphere

This was really good in my book. The volunteers are great, events are well-organised and the WhatsApp community is really active. There’s something happening every night, from language exchanges to cultural events and parties, so it's really easy to meet people - and loads of guests were really nice.

# Cleanliness & Maintenance

There are cleaning staff on-hand daily and they're always on top of things plus your room is cleaned once a week too. As mentioned above, guest messiness can be an issue sometimes in the kitchen, and there's still a lot of ongoing building work being done, this place is far from finished.

# Safety & Security

I'm not going to get into it about the safetiness rating of Medellín, I'll set off an argument between 3,000 people that'll never end. But, Laureles is pretty good going and I'd recommend the neighbourhood, but Co.404’s security policies are too lax. Entry is via a four-digit number, which is fine, but it was only updated once in the two weeks I was there. But the real clincher was the guest policy, which allows up to five visitors per person. Now, I'm sure that everybody staying there is fine, but do I trust their character judgment for the random guests they can bring in? When you pair this with the fact that you need to keep your massive bedroom window open at all times for ventilation, it's only a matter of time before somebody writes a post in this sub about their room being fleeced.

# Final Thoughts

If you like hostel life and are sick to the back teeth of lousy wi-fi, you'll probably really like this. The wi-fi is great and the social scene is really good too.

But as a long-term co-living and co-working space, it's just not ready and too many corners have been cut.

Give it six more months and check back, but for now, there are better options out there.

The actual body is spaced and bullet pointed\*** I attempted a 21 day fast a little over a year ago. Failed at 7 days. I took only 1 LMNT pack and 1 black coffee each day. Also broke fast wrong with food too early I think. Had bad toilet sessions whole day, all I ate was a hard boiled egg every 3 hours. Each egg followed by a session shortly after...

anyways

I work 6 days a week. I would say it's as physical as typical warehouse work but 7 hours per day but 2 of the days are at a computer or station for 5 hours.

\- Smoking cannabis ok? Quit cigarettes few months ago. Sometimes the cannabis deletes my appetite which is very helpful. Othertimes slightly hungry. Consumed by bong, pipe or joint.

\- microdose mushrooms ok? Probably recognized as a food item by body seems plausible.

\-supplements ok? I take the following 4. A probiotic, mushroom nootropic, psillium husk, mryrr gum. Should I remove any of these or all of these.

\- I intend to take serrapeptase for scar tissue removal (many previous injuries/broken bones) should this be taken all 21 days

\- A housemate buys a lot of LMNT so I could use (how many packs would you recommend per day every day) I put it in first cup of coffee and if recommended for more packs will do so with following water drinking. The RO water we have removes every thing so might be ieal.

\- I intend to at walk 3-8 miles every day to keep mind off of things and to prevent/slow down muscle atrophy. With weight training 4x a week.

\- Infared sauna ok? I currently do 3-5 sessions a week.

\- Should I attempt a PURE water fast with no coffee or electrolytes? (Sounds very ancestral because would they really be rolling around with coffee beans and salts... )

What other adjustments or things should I work up to. Like last few days towards beginning of fast go low carb/highfat/highprotein for easier transition?

Any thing else let me know, I want to try and at least go for 14 - 21 days this time around.

I work long haul jobs between the top of the territory and as far down as southern NSW. I’ve never been much of a believer in folklore and fantasies and what not. But I did always find the stories of strange lights in the sky quite fascinating.



So I’m pullin’ a 4 horse from The Isa up to Katherine. Got me beats goin, coffee’s hot, life’s good. Truly I mean, driving trucks isn’t the most exciting job in the world but, there’s a sense of freedom that comes with it. Something you feel in ya soul when you’re out there, and it’s just you and the open road ahead. It was a good night, I was enjoying the drive.



That’s when I caught sight of em. Well, the first time anyway. Just out the corner of my eye, right off on the horizon. It was faint, like a tiny glowing firefly if it was right in front of ya, but ya could tell this thing’s a ways off. Thing about the outback though distance can be deceiving. Coulda been 10 Ks away coulda been a hundred Ks away. But it was a ways off. It was just kinda, dancing there, beneath the moon. It was quite mesmerising actually. And that’s when I started feeling a bit strange like, I knew I had to keep my eyes on the road, but I felt like I didn’t wanna take my eyes off this thing. It was a bit scary actually but, in the end I managed to pull me focus back to the road ahead.



The drive continued on. Half a pot of coffee down, bout 300Ks to go. Was just thinkin about what I might like for brekkie once I hit Katherine, when I’m near on blinded. At first I thought some turkey must have been flashing his floodlights up me rear end. But nah, once the light clears, I take a look in the mirror. Now there’s two of the bloody things. Same as before, white, kinda yellowish light, ever so slightly glowing in the sky. It can’t have been headlights, they were bouncing up and down, almost rhythmically, but, out of sync with eachother if that makes sense. One would go up, then the other. No set of headlights I’ve ever seen does that.



I start puttin the foot down a bit at this point cause I got no idea what the hell this is. But the thing is, no mater how fast I go, no matter how far I go, these things are keeping pace with me. It’s a whole other kinda fear that is, in the middle of absolute nowhere with God knows what on ya tail. I just put it out of my mind by continuing to focus on the road ahead. I kept feeling that weird feeling though like, something bad would happen if I didn’t stay looking square at the lights. It was almost instinctual. Like for some reason I HAD to look at them. But I refused. I kept my focus right on that white dotted line. Eventually, I notice they’ve disappeared.



It’s hardly a relief, I mean they came back once didn’t they. Sure enough I would see those lights one more time. They were much closer this time. Too close for comfort that’s for bloody sure. By the time I caught sight of em again, it was like they were tryin to race my truck down the highway. Two of em again. Side by side, bouncing up and down, right outside my window. They held my gaze this time it was bloody terrifying, like I literally could not look away. The longer I looked the longer this feeling took over me like a dread, like I knew death was coming. Maybe it woulda been if I hadn’t been able to break that trance, but I did, took everything I had in me but I ripped my focus back onto the road, slowly applied the breaks (and anyone who drives trucks will know what a process this is from highway speed), and pulled over once I found a flat bit of land.



That was it, I was out. Dunno why, I wasn’t tired, but soon as that truck stopped, I was out like a light. I don’t remember anything else until I woke up. It was a good 14 15 hours later by what me watch was telling me. Everything in the truck was off, despite the fact I know I didn’t turn it off. Radio was dead too. That was a whole new horror within itself, stuck in the middle of the Aussie outback with no way to call anyone. You can imagine my relief when the engine did manage to tick over and roar back to life.



Still got no idea what the hell those were but my best guess of course (and, why I’m posting this here) is that I had an encounter with those min min lights. Like I said I’m not a big believer in this stuff but when you see something like that first hand it tends to change your beliefs somewhat. There’s been stories of these things dating back centuries. And the indigenous peoples tell stories of them, and similar happenings, going back much much further than that. So there’s gotta be something to it I suppose.



Anyway, if anyone can shed some light on this, I’m open to it. Hell, even if you wanna throw some kinda logical explanation my way, I’d sure appreciate that. As interesting as these stories can be, I sure would feel better knowing that these things are, in fact, not real.

3. Add flour and salt and mix until shaggy.
4. Fermentolyse 1 hour
5. 4 sets of coil folds 30-45 minutes apart, adding chocolate chips at the second set.
6. Bulk ferment. For me I think it was like 8 hours? 9? 10? Idk I have a baby and can’t keep track of times anymore I just read the dough lol. Once I think the dough is ready, I still give it like about another half hour or so. 
7. Shape.
8. Cold ferment (I did like 15 hours or so)
9. Bake. I don’t have a Dutch oven so I’ll share my open bake in a gas oven method:
-preheat oven to 450 minutes with a pan of water at the bottom to create steam. When the oven is preheated score your loaf and stick it in the oven. After 6 minutes, remove from oven and score again. Bake for 15 minutes with steam. After 15 minutes carefully remove the pan of water from the bottom. If you have a glass window on your oven door put a towel over it to prevent it from shattering if a drop of water got on it. Drop the temp to 430. Bake an additional 20 minutes. 
10. Cool completely before cutting.

1j5akdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1j5akdi/trip_report_22333/,Trip report 2/23-3/3,"We did 3 full days out of San Juan, then 4 on Vieques (not including travel days). The 4 days on Vieques was accidental but it ended up being totally fine and I wish we could’ve spent a week there. 

We rented a car through enterprise, pickup at the airport was super easy, as well as drop off. 
We stayed at Don Rafa in Miramar, and it was alright. The bathroom was a huge let down, tiny sink, tiny shower with no door so water got all over the floor, $25 valet every day which ends up in your total when you book anyways, $25 laundry. But the rooftop was very nice and was in a walkable location. Whenever we went to Old San Juan we just ubered. 

Our first day we did a day snorkeling trip to Culebra through aqua adventures, this was so fun however the water was extremely choppy on the way there and there was some sea sickness happening so bring Dramamine if you get motion sickness. they take you to two snorkeling spots, one is right off a beach that you can also spend some time on, they play music and offer rum punch and they provide lunch. The reef on Culebra was very pretty with lots to look at, and it was nice to see some healthier looking coral. 

Our second day we were planning on doing a full old San Juan day, but ended up in El Yunque in the morning instead. We pretty much stayed on the main road (191), we hit Juan Diego falls, all 3 were easy to find but it would be very muddy had it been raining, stopped at the Baño Grande historic site, Yokahu tower. We would’ve hiked but Mt Britton was socked in and I have bad knees and had some hiking plans the next day that I wanted to be ok for. Then we went to the visitor center and walked around the trails there. We got lunch at Simple Food in Luquillo, the smores coffee was amazing and food was solid. It rained the rest of the day so we just hung out at our hotel bar before our dinner reservations at marmalade. This was another highlight of our trip, as huge foodies we loved everything, especially the white bean soup (they’ll give you the recipe if you ask), the popcorn shrimp, duck duck goose, and the passion fruit dessert were standouts that I will think about for a long time. The global warming cocktail was delicious as well.

Third day we did a river caving tour with Batey adventures, this was another one of the highlights of our trip, you hike down to a river, kayak through a cave, then go back, trek/ float down the river to another cave, and it was just a blast learning about the environment and everything. 10/10 recommend - but listen to the directions they give you and not Apple Maps!! Or you will end up on the wrong road like us lol

After getting back we wandered around the streets of old San Juan taking photos, we stopped at La factoria and I was honestly underwhelmed. I’m sure it’s more fun at night on a weekend but it wasn’t my vibe. We ended up at Azeleas (Asian fusion) for dinner that evening and it was amazing. We sat at the bar and our bartender Jeffery was fantastic, the ceviche was my favorite I’ve had so far and all the drinks were so good. 

Then it was time to head to Vieques, we flew both ways which I thought was worth the splurge, and was much easier than taking the ferry. We stayed at Malecón House, and I loved it, the room was beautiful, pool area was great, walking distance of everything you need in Esperanza. They have any beach necessities you would need available too which is a huge plus. We rented a car through Vieques UTV rental, and while I was apprehensive due to their horrible reviews, it was a pleasant experience for us and we had no other option as they are the only rental company on the island that rents to people under the age of 25. 

While on Vieques we ate at El quenepo (this was our favorite), Placita (least favorite- would not recommend), Bili was pretty good, breakfast wise rising roost was amazing, but everything took forever- like over 2 hours for the entire thing. we ate at Kristy’s for breakfast twice since it was right next to our hotel and I really liked it. We had lunch one day at Gracias de nada and that was delicious, it’s conveniently located right by the exit of the wildlife refuge.

We went to Playa La chiva and Playa Caracas multiple times, La chiva was much more chill, very shallow and no waves. It had ok snorkeling, we went out towards the island (do not set foot on the island though lol) and there were some fish and lots of sea grass, not a lot of coral. It was fun to play in the waves at playa Caracas. We also visited the black sand beach at sunset. 

We also did the bio bay, this was the reason for our trip. It was very cool but it doesn’t look anything like pictures you see online. We did the 9pm with Jak water sports and they were a great tour, and no kids on the 9pm tour which was great. Definitely go close to the new moon. 

Overall it was a great trip and this sub helped tremendously when I was planning so thought I’d contribute my itinerary in case it helps anyone :)",1,1741306997.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False
1j5ak6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slovenia101/comments/1j5ak6m/what_are_the_best_hidden_spots_around_lake_bled/,"What Are The Best Hidden Spots Around Lake Bled, Slovenia?","Discovering the Best Hidden Spots Around Lake Bled, Slovenia
------------------------------------------------------------

If you're planning a trip to Lake Bled in Slovenia, you're in for a treat. While the iconic lake with its island and castle is breathtaking, there are several hidden spots around this stunning destination that you should not miss. These lesser-known gems offer fantastic views, unique experiences, and a chance to escape the crowds. Let’s explore these hidden spots that will help you discover the magic of Lake Bled.

### 1. Vintgar Gorge

Just a short drive from Lake Bled, Vintgar Gorge is often overlooked by visitors. This breathtaking natural wonder features a wooden walkway that leads you through the gorge along the Radovna River. You'll encounter stunning waterfalls, deep pools, and towering cliffs as you stroll. The contrast between the bright blue water and the lush greenery makes for unforgettable photos. Visiting in the early morning or late afternoon can help you avoid the larger crowds and fully appreciate the serene beauty of this hidden gem.

### 2. Ojstrica Viewpoint

For breathtaking views of Lake Bled and its island, make your way to Ojstrica Viewpoint. This spot is a bit of a climb, taking about 20-30 minutes to reach, but the reward is well worth it. Once you reach the top, you'll be greeted by one of the most picturesque views imaginable. It’s a perfect location for stunning sunrise or sunset photos. Be sure to bring your camera — you won't want to miss capturing the serene beauty of the lake framed by the surrounding mountains.

### 3. Bled Castle’s Secret Vantage Points

While many people visit Bled Castle for its historical significance and stunning views, there are secret vantage points around the castle that are often missed. Venture beyond the main viewing area and explore the castle grounds. You might find yourself alone in a tucked-away spot with incredible panoramic views of the lake and mountains. Spending time here allows you to soak in the beauty without the crowds.

### 4. Triglav National Park

A short drive from Lake Bled, Triglav National Park is a treasure chest of hidden spots perfect for outdoor enthusiasts. With hiking trails leading to secluded lakes and stunning mountain vistas, you can escape to nature and enjoy peace and quiet. Try hiking to Lake Bohinj, which is less touristy than Lake Bled but equally beautiful. Look for hidden trails that lead to lesser-known viewpoints for a truly intimate experience with Slovenia’s nature.

### 5. Pilgrimage Church of the Assumption of Maria

The Pilgrimage Church on Bled Island often draws crowds, but taking a quiet moment to explore the island itself can be incredibly rewarding. After visiting the church, wander around the island and discover its serene walking paths and hidden spots to relax. The tranquil atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of tourists can provide a much-needed respite, allowing you to fully experience this unique locale.

- Check out the famous wishing bell inside the church.
- Enjoy a peaceful walk around the island, taking in its natural beauty.

Looking forward to getting a notification!

Episode 1: “Simul”
FADE IN:
NIHILANTHIAN LANDSCAPE
The camera begins with a sweep view of the Nihilanth's world. “Thousands of years ago… A world untouched by the Combine” is displayed on screen. Establishing shots of a gray landscape with gray forests, gray towering mountains, and gray flowing rivers with a slight red hue. The entire atmosphere is gray except for the glint of blue sunlight flickering through the clouds every once in a while. Below, herds of massive, dull creatures roam, Nihilinthian Warriors. While smaller, more vibrant lifeforms float between the trees, Nihilinthian Civilians. Cut to The Nihilanth, tall, menacing, and covered in slimy gray skin, stands silently and still. It has elongated arms, a huge head that looks like it’s about to explode, and tentacles coming out of its underside. It moves slowly. The camera pans across a city view along with religious alien murals. Some Civilians sit in meditation, surrounded by their nature. Alien-like insects chirping around them. Suddenly, A ripple appears in the sky. Then a violent tear in the sky that expands like the world itself is being ripped open. The ground trembles and the camera shakes as massive war ships, metallic and covered in alien markings, descend from the rift. The first impact. A flash of light lights up the city as a city-sized ship slams onto the ground, its hull splitting the ground open in a violent quake. Dust and debris shoot up into the air, and the landscape is instantly engulfed by war. The invaders emerge from the sky like ants out of an anthill. Heavily armored gunships, towering striders, and massive Crab Synths. The invaders pour down even more, overwhelming the Warriors, causing destruction and death. The Nihilanth senses the threat and springs into action. It’s telekinetic powers activating in the blue-green aura surrounding it. It raises boulders and chunks of land to throw and the projectiles smash into the giant ships with large explosions of dirt, rock, and fire. The camera shows a battle between the two forces. Gunfire and plasma explosions echo through the air, the sound of weapons discharging rapidly. Explosions boom through the air as Nihilanthian Warriors clash with Striders. The invaders technology overwhelms their psychic powers. A close-up shows a Nihilanthian Warrior, its face filled with desperation, as it rushes forward. It raises its hands, sending blasts of intense plasma energy toward a Crab Synth. The blast sends the Synth flying, but just as the warrior wins, a gunship opens fire with its cannon, the shells tearing through the Warrior’s body. A dark-green mist fills the air as the Warrior’s body is shredded, its limbs and giant head torn apart in a nasty explosion of flesh and blood. During the battle, the camera pans over Nihilanthian civilians, helpless in comparison, and caught in the crossfire. A young Civilian, is vaporized by a plasma turret, its body disintegrates into a cloud of ash and charred remains. The camera pulls back to show the battlefield: piles of broken bodies lay everywhere. Both the Nihilinthians and the invaders alike, litter the ground. The landscape is a nightmare, with craters smoking from recent explosions, burning wreckage from ships that destroyed important buildings and structures. Warriors continue to fight, but their powers are slowly weakening. The battle is over quickly. An Advisor stands at the back, surveying the battlefield with zero emotion. He raises a hand and signals to his forces. The Crab Synths march forward as they begin rounding up the surviving victims. The camera shows them being herded like cattle, their eyes filled with panic. Metal restraints are clamped around the Citizens limbs, the Warriors are placed in cages, and the dead bodies are dragged away. 

INSIDE COMBINE SHIP-MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTED- “Groovin’ High” by Dizzy Gillespie

The Invaders begin start biological experiments. The camera lingers on the operations as they cut, dissect, and mutate the captured Warriors and Civilians. The camera shows different genetic modifications being made to enhance the creatures for combat. Their bodies withered, their skin ripped open, their blood leaking through poorly manufactured metal parts as they go through painful alterations. Screams echo in the air.

“Simul”
END MUSIC SEQUENCE

OUTSIDE COMBINE SHIP
The Nihilanth, right outside the unholy-sized ship, escapes the terror. Its body looks like a grotesque patchwork of blood-dripping wounds. It struggles but then flys away very quickly. The camera follows it as it stumbles into the wreckage of the Civilians place of religion, it finds an ancient rift deep in the pits of the building. There is a tear in space. It takes one last look at the hellish landscape. The camera goes still for a moment behind The Nihilanth as it approaches the portal. It floats through the rift. Its mangled hands, covered in lime and dark green colored blood, slide against the edges of the portal as it vanishes into the unknown. There’s a distant sound of its people screaming before it is swallowed by a dark void. 

FADE IN:
EARTH, 1943 “A world untouched by the Combine?” is displayed on screen
The camera gives an establishing shot during a downpour inside a city of a factory with the words “Aperture Fixtures” nailed to the front. Cut to a young Cave Johnson, sharp-dressed and clean-cut. He is sitting hunched over a messy desk in a small and dimly lit office. His sleeves are rolled up, tie loosened a little, and a cigarette burns between his fingers. The room is a mess of blueprints, diagrams, and handwritten calculations. They are all scattered across the wooden surface, some are crumpled. The camera shows a half drank cup of coffee sitting next to a stack of papers. Cave taps his pencil against his temple, he is looking at a rough sketch of a tractor. His handwriting is aggressive as he scribbles down notes, then scratches them out just as quickly. He is evidently frustrated. He leans back in his chair sighing.

Cave (muttering): ""A Tractor... ugh. That’s not gonna do shit for me.”

He crumples up the paper.

Cave (complaining): “Come on… Why can i never think of something good when i need it?”

He sighs.

Cave: “Life doesn’t make any sense.”

He rubs his temples, thinking. He looks up towards the wall. Cut to a poster of his father looking smiley and goofy.
 
“Theories of Profitable Farming” 

And underneath that,

“1. Do Everything From Scratch 2. Spare No Expense 3. Never Cut Corners” 

He sighs.

Cave (sadly): “Sorry Dad. Farming just doesn’t money anymore.”

Cave (determined): “I need something HUGE, I need something every god damn person in the world will use.”

He takes a hit off his cigarette and blows out the smoke, watching it spin towards the ceiling. Suddenly he jumps up in his chair.

Cave (to himself): “Shower curtains… shower curtains.”

His eyes dart to the blueprint paper beside him. He grabs the nearest piece of paper and quickly starts sketching. The phone on his desk rings loudly. He grabs it quickly and eagerly.

Cave: ""Ralph, shut the fuck up.” 

Cut to Ralph, A clean looking man in his late 40s with a sharp face and streaks of gray hair, in his very neat and put together office.

Ralph: “But I didn’t even-“

Cut to Cave: “Listen, I’ve got it. I’ve got the idea that’s gonna make us RICH.""

Cut to Ralph pausing for a beat, then leaning forward interested. Then cut back to Cave

Ralph (voice-over): “Go on.”

Cave: ""Shower curtains.""

Cave has a goofy smile on his face. Cut to Ralph looking disappointed. There’s an uncomfortable silence.

Ralph: ""Cave…” Cut to Cave still looking goofy.

Ralph (voice-over): “…what the hell are you talking about?""

Cave grins like a child and taps his pencil against the desk anxiously.

Cave: ""Not just any curtains, Ralph. The best god damn shower curtains anyone’s ever seen.”

Another awkward silence. 

Cut to Ralph (in disbelief): ""What is wrong with you. I’m genuinely asking. You went from a tractor to shower curtains?""

Cave: ""Ralph, listen to me. Everybody has a shower curtain. It’s in every home, every hotel, every hospital. Hell, half the country probably has one that’s goin’ to shit right now. You buy one, what happens?”

Cut to Ralph looking slightly confused.

Cave (voice-over): “It tears, gets moldy, leaks water all over the fuckin’ floor… So…?”

Ralph: ""So... what? You’re making durable shower curtains?""

Cut to Cave smirking.

Cave: ""Exactly! Water-resistant, vapor-resistant, tear-proof.”

Cave chuckles.

Cave (smiling): “A curtain that lasts forever. Imagine it, Ralph. The thing sells itself.""

Cut to Ralph: “Are you serious?”

Cut back to Cave. Silence on the other end for a few seconds. Cave looks desperate.

Ralph (voice-over, annoyed): ""Alright, fine. You got my attention-“ 

Cave covers the phone and shouts “YES!” quietly.

Ralph (voice-over): “But you gotta show me the numbers."" 

Cave leans back in his chair, rolling a pencil between his fingers, he looks at ease.

Cave: ""Numbers are the easy part, Ralph. The product is what’s gotta convince you. You give me a little time, I’ll give you a curtain that can withstand a hurricane god damn it. People will be buying ‘em in bulk.""

Ralph exhales.

Cut to Ralph : ""Fine… This better be good, Cave.""

Ralph puts down the phone. quick cut to Cave. The line clicks dead. Cave sets the receiver down, his grin widening. He grabs a fresh sheet of paper, and starts drawing with intensity. His pencil scratches loudly on the page. The Aperture Fixtures logo sits at the top of the paper. Below it, a rough outline of a shower curtain made of metal mesh and synthetic polymer. The camera focuses on his concentrated expression. Cut to his cigarette burning down in the ashtray, smoke curling lazily into the air.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN:
The scene opens with an establishing shot inside a local bank. Polished floors, heavy looking wooden desks, and the sound of typewriters and murmured conversations. The camera pans to a private office where Cave Johnson sits across from Mr. Saint, a seasoned banker in his late 50s with a thick mustache, a receding hairline, and the demeanor of a arrogant man with too much money. His suit is perfectly pressed, his expression is skeptical. Cave is a ball of jittery energy. His shirt is slightly unbuttoned, his sleeves are rolled up, and his cigarette is almost sucked down to the cotton. A blueprint is spread across the desk between them. It shows a rough sketch of a reinforced shower curtain, with dumb annotations like ""Indestructible as Hell.""
Saint stares at the blueprint, then back at Cave.

Saint: ""So… you want me to finance hole-proof… shower curtains.""

Cave leans forward grinning.

Cave: ""Not only hole-proof. Vapor-resistant, mold-proof, tear-proof, stain-proof, and most importantly, profitable.""

Saint sighs, rubbing his temples.

Saint: ""Cave, do you have any experience at all in manufacturing shower curtains?""

Cave (grinning): ""Nope. Not at all. And that’s exactly why I’m the perfect guy to revolutionize this industry. Think about it alright… people have been using the same flimsy plastic pieces of shit for decades. They rip easy. They get nasty. They gotta be replaced all the fucking time. Now what if you didn’t have to deal with all that?”

Saint exhales through his nose.

Saint: ""And this material you’re using? What is it, exactly?""

Caves face lit up.

Cave: ""Good question. It’s top secret stuff. A blend of reinforced synthetic polymers and, if I can get the funding, a little bit of titanium alloy.”

Saint gives him a negative look.

Saint: ""You’re talking about making shower curtains out of military materials?""

Cave (proudly): ""That’s right. Why should the military be the only ones who get to enjoy long-lasting durability? I know I would love it.” 

Cave pauses.

Cave (confidently): “It’s for the people Saint.”

Saint leans back and looks at Cave like he’s crazy. Saint then starts to consider it. Saint picks up the blueprint and studies it.

Saint (skeptical): ""Alright, Cave. Say I give you a loan and you get these things made. How the hell do you plan to sell them? I can guarantee you nobody is out there saying, ‘You know what I need? A reinforced shower curtain!’”

Cave: ""That’s the thing, Saint. People don’t know they need it, until I tell ‘em they do.”

Cave smirks and taps the side of his head pointing to his brain. Saint focuses his eyes back on the paper.

Saint: ""Marketing?""

Cave: ""Picture this… stay with me now… big, bold commercials. Radio spots. I might even hire one of those big dudes to stand at a firing range and spray the curtain full auto. People eat that shit up.""

Saint sighs again, rubbing his eyes.

Saint: ""Alright, Cave. Show me the numbers. If they check out, maybe, MAYBE I’ll consider a small loan.""

Cave leans back, smirking arrogantly.

CUT TO:
CREATING THE FIRST CURTAIN - MONTAGE - FAST PACED - “Gold On the Ceiling” by The Black Keys

Cave in a warehouse, shouting while trying to communicate with a team of foreign factory workers.
Sheets of different looking experimental fabric being dunked in water, burned, stabbed, or stretched to its limits.
Cave holding up a curtain full of scratches, holes, and burn marks, frowning. ""Back to the board!"" x3 (different sheets for each time) (dark grey one with a ton of holes and tears) (one covered in green algae and gets easily ripped in half by Cave on accident.)
Cut to Cave in a makeshift office, covered in soot, drinking whiskey, and sketching furiously on a new blueprint. Camera zooms in on his face lighting up and looking excited.
Cut to the new curtain being tested, it holds up. The workers cheer. Cave throws his hands in the air like he just won the Super Bowl.
END MONTAGE

CHEAP MOTEL
Establishing shot of a rundown motel at nighttime. Crickets chirping. Cut to Cave and a motel manager in Bathroom. A bored-looking motel manager in his 50s, with a yellow-stained undershirt and dirty plaid over shirt stands across from Cave, who is holding his prototype curtain.

Cave: ""Alright, Lou, tell me, how often do you usually need replace your shower curtains?""

Lou (looking down): ""Eh. Twice a year, maybe three or four times if i’m unlucky. People like to ruin ‘em. They tear ‘em up, throw up on ‘em, spill shit on ‘em, and damn, those stains WILL NOT come out.""

Cave looks slightly disgusted but continues anyway.

Cave (loudly and awkwardly): ""Well… Not anymore!""

He throws a prototype curtain over the motel shower rod. Then he pulls out a pocket knife and stabs it violently. Lou jumps back.

Lou: ""Jesus Cave!""

Cave grinning: ""Check it out. Not a single scratch. Stab-proof, tear-proof, and stain-resistant. You know, your guests… they could take a chainsaw to this thing, and it would still look as beautiful it did when you first bought it.”

Lou stares at the curtain in disbelief, then back at Cave. Cave crosses his arms.

Lou: “How much?""

Cave: ""A little more than normal, but trust me, you’ll never need to buy one again.""

Lou thinks for a second. Cave points at him and smiles. Lou nods.

Lou: ""Gimme five of ‘em.""

They shake hands.

Cave (giddy): ""Pleasure doing business.”

Cut to Cave walking out of the motel, lighting a cigarette, and grinning like the Joker.

CUT TO:
FACTORY FLOOR - ASSEMBLY LINE
Workers stitching and packaging the first batch of high-tech shower curtains. Machines humming, sparks flying, men in grease-stained shirts wiping sweat from their forehead. Cave strolls through it all. His hands tucked in his pockets, cigarette hanging from his lips, grinning proudly.
A worker, young and pale, jogs up beside Cave, wiping his hands on his apron.

Worker: “Cave I’m sorry but I gotta ask… these curtains-“

Caves ear perks up.

Worker: “-they look nice and all but… why are they so special to you? Y’know, besides the staining and tearing protection.”

Cave stops so suddenly the worker nearly walks into him. He sighs and turns towards one of the curtains hanging up on the line. In one swift motion, Cave reaches into his jacket, pulls out a .45 pistol and without blinking fires three rounds straight into the curtain hanging from a nearby test rack. The gunshots silence the factory. Workers drop their tools. One guy ducks behind a crate. Someone yells,

“SHIT!” 

The bullets hit the curtain and dropped harmlessly to the floor. The fabric doesn’t even have a scuff. Silence. Every worker in the room stares at Cave, then back at the curtain. Cave takes a hit from his cigarette, then laughs wholeheartedly at the crowd.

The first 7 days were really difficult. I’m in my 40’s and in great shape, but this recovery hasn’t been easy. For anyone thinking of getting this surgery, don’t wait this long but also don’t get it too early. My jaw changed in my twenties. Early thirties would have been ideal time. 

I can’t believe how much better I can breathe, so it has been worth the journey, so far. Now I’m praying everything heals.

1j5a2gr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5a2gr,[Review] 1 month after Halo laser,"My first post in this community! I only recently started using Reddit more and hope to hear your thoughts.

Summary of skin journey:

I love skincare and have been an avid user of skincare for probably 10-15 years or so, with a focus on korean skincare for the past 7-8 years. I am almost in my mid-30s, Asian, and get mistaken for being in my mid-20s often. I have very oily skin with little to no wrinkles and tried one round of accutane in high school, close to 20 years ago.  I had been on BCP for a bit and decided to quit them about 5 years ago. After that, my skin purged like crazy for a few months with cystic breakouts along my chin and jaw line as well as on my cheeks. Shortly after that purge, I started spironolactone and my hormonal acne has been relatively well-controlled. I now mainly get hormonal breakouts or breakouts from stress/low sleep/eating too much dairy.

Why Halo:

Spironolactone has helped my skin's oil production a little bit but I still have very oily skin. I'm self conscious about my skin texture (large pores, some ice pick and boxcar scars), uneven skin tone, and PIE marks especially on my cheeks. I have tried many products to lighten the PIE and address the texture (azelaic acid, alpha arbutin, niacinamide, vitamin C, AHA/BHA/glycolic acids, etc.) and I feel they have helped but very slowly. In the past I have also tried a couple sessions of microneedling as well as chemical peels. Makeup can hide some of my PIE but because my skin is so oily, the makeup eventually breaks down and I feel like the PIE is pretty visible after a long day. I decided to do Halo on a week where I was on vacation and could heal at home for at least 5 days.

Halo experience:

Day 1- I was numbed with a topical numbing cream for 45 minutes and the procedure itself took maybe another 45 minutes. The technician said she had 15-20 years of experience doing lasers and I believed it, since she was in her 60s and her skin looked amazing. She did multiple passes on all areas of my face, the first pass was about a 4/10 in pain, up to 6/10 for the last pass. Afterwards, I used the air blower thing on my face for 5-10 minutes and still was only about 6/10 in pain. They provided me a bag of after care products for home (cleanser, thermal water spray, SPF, cica lotion, hyaluronic acid serum). Throughout the first day, the discomfort reached a 8/10. My face felt very hot and swollen, for which I used a cooling mask and the thermal water spray that the clinic provided me. I also had a fan which blew on my face while I watched TV. I took a couple of tylenols to help with the swelling/heat. Overall, I was surprised at how the procedure itself was much less painful than I was anticipating. It's the heat dissipation after the procedure that is the most uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

Day 2- More swelling, more redness, more of the coffee-ground-like MENDS that started to form. I could now wash my face and start using the aftercare lotion. I slept on an extra pillow overnight to decrease swelling. Didn't feel like I needed any painkillers. Discomfort from heat was 6-7/10.

Day 3-5- Lots of MENDS throughout my whole face. I was very careful slathering the thick cica lotion on my face, to not disrupt the healing process with the MENDS so they can naturally fall off. By day 5, much of the MENDS had fallen off. By now, I felt little to no discomfort.

Day 6- I had to go back to work and felt comfortable using a bit of makeup to cover up some of the bright pink hue of my skin. I felt my skin looked pretty good in that week, probably from residual inflammation plumping up my scars. Still had some residual flakiness but not obvious dark-brown MENDS.

One month later- For the first two weeks, I noticed that my skin was pretty pink even after I used some makeup to try to neutralize the redness. The pinky ness faded away in the third week. During this month, I've had a very erratic sleep schedule and long work hours (26-28 hour shifts), but I have tried to keep up with my skincare on my shorter work days and days off. I also have been exercising and trying to eat well. I feel that my scars and PIE have softened and the PIE is a bit less pigmented and the edges are not as noticeable. I can't say I'm super disappointed and I don't regret getting the Halo done, but a part of me is also hoping for a more significant change in my skin quality later down the line. However, I do feel that my makeup goes on smoother and covers the PIE marks better than prior to Halo. These next few weeks I'll have a better sleep schedule so maybe that can influence the healing process too.

Photos: I tried to use the same angle and lighting in my bathroom for all the photos. I will say, I feel like this lighting accentuates my scars/hyperpigmentation lol.

Overall, I'm happy with the experience, especially since it was not as painful as I thought it'd be. It's very pricey though, and taking a week off of work to heal is a lot. I'm hopeful for the long haul, and I know collagen production and significant improvements probably won't be seen for weeks. I would like to try this again in a couple years or so, but for now I will do microneedling at home for maintenance.

Have you recently invested in a dazzling smile through professional teeth whitening? If so, you're probably wondering about the dos and don'ts of maintaining your pristine results. One common question that troubles many patients is whether they can enjoy their favorite white wine after the procedure. Teeth whitening is a delicate process that requires careful attention to preserve your bright, radiant smile. Understanding the potential impacts of white wine on your newly whitened teeth is crucial for maintaining those pearly whites and protecting your investment in a beautiful smile.

Can You Drink White Wine After Teeth Whitening? The Complete Guide

Immediate Post-Whitening Restrictions

Immediately after teeth whitening, your teeth are at their most vulnerable. The whitening process temporarily increases the porosity of your tooth enamel, making them more susceptible to staining and sensitivity. During the first 48 hours following your treatment, it's crucial to avoid:

- White wine
- Red wine
- Coffee
- Tea
- Dark-colored sodas
- Colored sauces
- Berries and other deeply pigmented foods

Why White Wine Poses a Risk

White wine might seem harmless, but it can still cause problems for freshly whitened teeth. **The acidic nature of white wine can be particularly damaging** to your newly treated teeth. The acid temporarily softens tooth enamel, making it more porous and vulnerable to:

1. Staining
2. Increased sensitivity
3. Potential discoloration
4. Enamel damage

Scientific Insights into Wine and Tooth Discoloration

Research shows that white wine contains acids that can create microscopic pores in tooth enamel. These tiny openings make your teeth more susceptible to staining from other beverages and foods. A study published in the Journal of Dentistry found that wine's acidic properties can reduce mineral content in teeth, potentially compromising their whiteness.

Safe Waiting Period for Drinking White Wine

Dental professionals recommend waiting at least 48-72 hours before consuming white wine after teeth whitening. This waiting period allows your tooth enamel to:

- Remineralize
- Reduce sensitivity
- Seal the whitening treatment
- Restore its natural protective barrier

Alternatives During the Waiting Period

While avoiding white wine might seem challenging, consider these alternatives:

- Water
- Clear spirits
- White grape juice
- Coconut water
- Sparkling water with a splash of lemon

Protecting Your Whitened Teeth Long-Term

After the initial waiting period, you can gradually reintroduce white wine. To minimize potential staining:

- Drink water between wine glasses
- Use a straw
- Rinse your mouth immediately after drinking
- Maintain good oral hygiene

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Professional Recommendations

Most dentists advise patients to:
- Wait 48-72 hours before drinking white wine
- Use a straw when consuming potentially staining beverages
- Brush teeth carefully
- Consider professional cleaning and touch-up treatments

Understanding Tooth Sensitivity

Teeth whitening can cause temporary sensitivity. When combined with white wine's acidic properties, this sensitivity might be more pronounced. If you experience significant discomfort, consult your dental professional.

Additional Considerations for Wine Lovers

**Wine enthusiasts need not despair**. With proper care and timing, you can enjoy white wine while maintaining your bright smile. The key is patience and following professional guidance.

Conclusion

Protecting your newly whitened teeth requires careful attention and temporary lifestyle adjustments. While white wine can pose risks immediately after teeth whitening, following professional advice will help you maintain your beautiful smile. By waiting the recommended period and practicing good oral hygiene, you can continue to enjoy your favorite beverages while keeping your teeth looking their absolute best. Your radiant smile is worth the short-term sacrifice of temporarily avoiding white wine.",1,1741305368.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

The Delonghi Eletta Explore fell of because I'm not interested in cold brew and ""to go"" coffee so I would pay extra for something I wont use anyway.

What I want to now if it's worth the extra budget for the PrimaDonna Soul to get the flat burr and Bean Adapt Technology. Does it make any noticeable difference?

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don’t brag but I’ve been told it’s desirable, but it mostly just tears me apart.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

Dear lord... Forgive my ignorance.

I happened to chance upon a deal on a really nice glass set with wood stand recently and I figured what's one more device to add to the collection of Flair Pro 2, Chemex, French Press, Moka pot, Aeropress with Prismo and Joepresso attachments, Cezve, and the like, right? I get it home and realize I have no filters, so I buy some Cafec Abacca and today is delivery plus test day. I followed the Hoffman technique from the Coffee at Home book and here I am, in complete shock and awe at the remarkably clear, smooth, silt/ sludge free cup of coffee I've ever experienced. 

How I've managed to go this long in complete bliss, thinking my collection was good enough, I will never know. In comparison, the Chemex delivers a great cup of coffee, also very smooth, paper free taste, lots of flavor, and good palatability, but the V60 feels almost more refined? I feel like it has less overall body than other brewers, but I equate it to the feeling of eating guilt-free when on a strict diet. Its just good, you feel good, it's light but holds its own and settles well without any of the drawbacks from alternate coffee brewers. 

Anyway, there's a lot running through my mind at the moment, but this is absurd with how good it is. I had to share and say for anybody who might be on the fence, do it.

At the start of November I began suffering from silent reflux symptoms (burning in my throat and globus), I’d never had it before and it was driving me mad. Plus I’m a singer and I was panicked my whole career would be ruined as it could damage my voice. Well right before these symptoms began appearing my dad had just been diagnosed with cancer. At first we thought he was inoperable and didn’t have long to live. I felt incredibly depressed and anxious but tried to plough on with my studies and other life things as best I could. I went crazy with food elimination and sitting very upright all time, elevating my bed etc. This helped to make it less pronounced but it didn’t go away and it really flared up around Christmas when I let myself indulge in food and drink. 

In January doctors discovered they could operate on my dad and while things are challenging, his chances look a lot better now. Since he came out the hospital some time in late January I’ve rarely noticed my symptoms at all and I really think it’s because I’m not carrying this heavy burden anymore. I’m back eating chocolate, tomatoes, citrus, spicy food, not elevating my bed and it all seems to be fine. I really think it was largely psychological. I even cut out all alcohol for a while but I got tipsy for the first time a couple weeks ago and didn’t get any flare up after. Around the time my symptoms were flaring, I was also suffering from an IBS flare up which usually happens when I’m carrying stress.

Well I don’t know whether this problem is gone for good or not, but I will just say before you panic yourself and waste hours on these threads thinking you’ll never get better, maybe prioritise your mental health. Meditate, go and exercise, meet up with some friends and try to take a day off from worrying. Continue to live a healthy lifestyle but maybe let go of the tight grip you may be holding on everything.

I am believed to have Crohn’s but have not been officially diagnosed (not a long enough time pattern of symptoms I guess), though my mother is diagnosed with Crohn’s. Doctors have tossed around that I may have an autoimmune issue of some sort, and that I may have Ehler’s Danlos. I take venlafaxine, rexulti, adderall, and an oral birth control tablet. I am 125 pounds and am 5’6”. I drink one cup of coffee per day and I occasionally take a powdered collagen supplement. I drink alcohol maybe two times a month, I try to keep it to a minimum as it gives me inflammation issues and really takes a toll on my body. 

Background on the situation: I have been getting hit with back-to-back viral infections for about five weeks now. First it was a mild cold, I recovered, then I caught Covid, started to recover, and now I am sick again. I went to Urgent Care three days ago and was treated with a steroid sore-throat cocktail that they called “Magic Mouthwash” (I love that).  

Now here’s the thing. Aside from being sick, I feel and look way better than usual. Even though I’m really sick (coughing up dark green and blood, eyes crusted shut kind of sick) my skin is glowing, soft, and smooth. My face looks visibly different to myself, like my skin somehow depuffed. All my acne has cleared up. Any small wounds I had on my body (tendency to pick at my skin) seem to be healing really well, despite my body usually struggling to do so. I haven’t been zoning out or getting lost in picking. I feel clear-headed and focused. My regular knee pain is gone. My standard intestinal discomfort is gone. My mental state seems to have improved tenfold. I feel very calm, “with-it”, and positive. I’m feeling no anxiety or depression.

So my question is this: could this be because of the steroid? It’s the only thing that changed at all. Is there anything that jumps out at you that I should be looking into? For years I have felt that there is something going on with my body that I just haven’t found out yet, some secret key staring me in the face that, once found, will allow me to feel better and live better.

On first date we grabbed a coffee went for walk in the city for like 2 hours talked about our interests and stuff.

On second date we again went for a coffee and sat down to get some sun and talked to each other.

We are literal opposites of each other in everything be it music, movies etc....

- It feels like she is interested because we both were making plans together, on the first date she herself hinted for the second date.

- She was the first to break the touch barrier on both dates like playfully hitting.

I'm super excited for an upcoming group trip to Puerto Rico!  We are a group of 6 women celebrating our 40th birthdays.  We'll be staying in the Isla Verde area, close to the Fairmont El San Juan Hotel.  We aren't renting a car and will be walking or relying on Uber/Lyft.  

I'm looking for restaurant and bar recommendations - primarily in Isla Verde & Old San Juan.  We are a pretty casual bunch, but like good food and a fun atmosphere.  We will be in search of the best pernil & mofongo.  I'm also looking for places where I can get fresh juices, like green juice, and coffee shops & dessert places. Plus places for us to go out at night for dancing and fun.  Any recommendations are appreciated!  Thanks!

  
Here is our itinerary:

Day 1 - Arrive in the afternoon, dinner/drinks/dessert/going out in Isla Verde.

Day 2 - Guided tour of El Yunque Rainforest in the afternoon/evening; we'll be stopping at Luquillo Beach for the kiosks for dinner.  Breakfast in Isla Verde.  Going out at night in Isla Verde.

Day 3 - Photoshoot in Old San Juan in the late afternoon/early evening.  Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch in Isla Verde & Dinner/going out at night in Old San Juan.

Day 4 - Fajardo Bay Bio. Kayak - this is from like 4:30-9:30pm, so we'll probably have a late lunch and then a really late dinner after.  Possibly breakfast in Old San Juan or somewhere else, lunch in Isla Verde, late night eats in Isla Verde.

I've been following this subreddit and I know there are already a lot of recommendations, but I'm finding it a little overwhelmed and hard to choose between places. Thanks for your help!",1,1741304634.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

1j59k01,https://i.redd.it/hwbq3mm4n5ne1.jpeg,The last surviving witness to the Battle of the Alamo in 1902,"This was posted on the Traces of Texas FB page earlier today:

This is Don Enrique Esparza, the last surviving witness of the Battle of the Alamo, late in his life. In November, 1902, the San Antonio Light Newspaper published the following article about Enrique Esparza and it is fantastic. Here is the text:

""Since the death of Senora Candelaria Villanueva, several years ago at the age of 112 there is but one person alive who claims to have been in the siege of the Alamo. That person is Enrique Esparza, now 74 years old, who, firm-stepped, clear-minded and clear-eyed, bids fair to live to the age of the woman who for so long shared honors with him.

Enrique Esparza, who tells one of the most interesting stories ever narrated, works a truck garden on Nogalitos street between the southern Pacific Railroad track and the San Pedro creek. Here he lives with the family of his son, Victor Esparza. Every morning he is up before daybreak and helps load the wagons with garden stuff that is to be taken up town to market.

He is a farmer of experience and contributes very materially to the success of the beautiful five acres garden, of which he is the joint proprietor.

While claims of Enrique Esparza have been known among those familiar with the historical work done by the Daughters of the Republic, an organization which has taken great interest in getting first-hand information of the period of Texas Independence, the old man was not available up to about five years ago, for the reason that he resided on his farm in Atascosa county. This accounts for the fact that he is not well enough known to be included in the itinerary when San Antonians are proudly doing the town with their friends.

Esparza tells a straight story. Every syllable he speaks to uttered with confidence and in his tale, he frequently makes digressions, going into details of relationship of early families of San Antonio and showing a tenacious memory. At the time of the fight of the Alamo he was 8 years old. His father was a defender, and his father's own brother an assailant of the Alamo. He was a witness of his mother's grief, and had his own grief, at the slaughter in which his father was included. As he narrated to a reporter the events in which he was so deeply concerned, his voice several times choked and he could not proceed for emotion. While he has a fair idea of English, he preferred to talk in Spanish.

""My father, Gregorio Esparza, belonged to Benavides' company, in the American army,"" said Esparza, ""and I think it was in February, 1836, that the company was ordered to Goliad when my father was ordered back alone to San Antonio, for what I don't know. When he got here there were rumors that Santa Ana was on the way here, and many residents sent their families away. One of my father's friends told him that he could have a wagon and team and all necessary provisions for a trip, if he wanted to take his family away. There were six of us besides my father; my mother, whose name was Anita, my eldest sister, myself and three younger brothers, one a baby in arms. I was 8 years old.

""My father decided to take the offer and move the family to San Felipe. Everything was ready, when one morning, Mr. W. Smith, who was godfather to my youngest brother, came to our house on North Flores street, just above where the Presbyterian church now is, and told my mother to tell my father when he came in that Santa Ana had come. (Northeast corner of Houston and N. Flores Streets.)

""When my father came my mother asked him what he would do. You know the Americans had the Alamo, which had been fortified a few months before by General Cos.

""Well, I'm going to the fort"" my father said.

""Well, if pop goes, I am going along, and the whole family too.

""It took the whole day to move and an hour before sundown we were inside the fort. Where was a bridge over the river about where Commerce street crosses it, and just as we got to it we could her Santa Anna's drums beating on Milam Square, and just as we were crossing the ditch going into the fort Santa Anna fired his salute on Milam Square.

""There were a few other families who had gone in. A Mrs. Cabury[?] and her sister, a Mrs. Victoriana, and a family of several girls, two of whom I knew afterwards, Mrs. Dickson, Mrs. Juana Melton, a Mexican woman who had married an American, also a woman named Concepcion Losoya and her son, Juan, who was a little older than I.

""The first thing I remember after getting inside the fort was seeing Mrs. Melton making circles on the ground with an umbrella. I had seen very few umbrellas. While I was walking around about dark I went near a man named Fuentes who was talking at a distance with a soldier. When the latter got near me he said to Fuentes:

""Did you know they had cut the water off?""

""The fort was built around a square. The present Hugo-Schmeltzer building is part of it. I remember the main entrance was on the south side of the large enclosure. The quarters were not in the church, but on the south side of the fort, on either side of the entrance, and were part of the convent. There was a ditch of running water back of the church and another along the west side of Alamo Plaza. We couldn't got to the latter ditch as it was under fire and it was the other one that Santa Anna cut off. The next morning after we had gotten in the fort I saw the men drawing water from a well that was in the convent yard. The well was located a little south of the center of the square. I don't know whether it is there now or not.

""On the first night a company of which my father was one went out and captured some prisoners. One of them was a Mexican soldier, and all through the siege, he interpreted the bugle calls on the Mexican side, and in this way the Americans know about the movements of the enemy.

""After the first day there was fighting. The Mexicans had a cannon somewhere near where Dwyer avenue now is, and every fifteen minutes they dropped a shot into the fort.

""The roof of the Alamo had been taken off and the south side filled up with dirt almost to the roof on that side so that there was a slanting embankment up which the Americans could run and take positions. During the fight I saw numbers who were shot in the head as soon as they exposed themselves from the roof. There were holes made in the walls of the fort and the Americans continually shot from these also. We also had two cannon, one at the main entrance and one at the northwest corner of the fort near the post office. The cannon were seldom fired.

""I remember Crockett. He was a tall, slim man, with black whiskers. He was always at the head. The Mexicans called him Don Benito. The Americans said he was Crockett. He would often come to the fire and warm his hands and say a few words to us in the Spanish language. I also remember hearing the names of Travis and Bowie mentioned, but I never saw either of them that I know of.

""After the first few days I remember that a messenger came from somewhere with word that help was coming. The Americans celebrated it by beating the drums and playing on the flute. But after about seven days fighting there was an armistice of three days and during this time Don Benito had conferences every day with Santa Anna. Badio, the interpreter, was a close friend of my father, and I heard him tell my father in the quarters that Santa Anna had offered to let the Americans go with their lives if they would surrender, but the Mexicans would be treated as rebels.

""During the armistice my father told my mother she had better take the children and go, while she could do so safely. But my mother said:

""No!, if you're going to stay, so am I. If they kill one they can kill us all.

""Only one person went out during the armistice, a woman named Trinidad Saucedo.

""Don Benito, or Crockett, as the Americans called him, assembled the men on the last day and told them Santa Anna's terms, but none of them believed that any one who surrendered would get out alive, so they all said as they would have to die any how they would fight it out.

""The fighting began again and continued every day, and nearly every night,. One night there was music in the Mexican camp and the Mexican prisoner said it meant that reinforcements had arrived.

""We then had another messenger who got through the lines, saying that communication had been cut off and the promised reinforcements could not be sent.

""On the last night my father was not out, but he and my mother were sleeping together in headquarters. About 2 o'clock in the morning there was a great shooting and firing at the northwest corner of the fort, and I heard my mother say:

""Gregorio, the soldiers have jumped the wall. The fight's begun.

""He got up and picked up his arms and went into the fight. I never saw him again. My uncle told me afterwards that Santa Anna gave him permission to get my father's body, and that he found it where the thick of the fight had been.

""We could hear the Mexican officers shouting to the men to jump over, and the men were fighting so close that we could hear them strike each other. It was so dark that we couldn't see anything, and the families that were in the quarters just huddled up in the corners. My mother's children were near her. Finally they began shooting through the dark into the room where we were. A boy who was wrapped in a blanket in one corer was hit and killed. The Mexicans fired into the room for at least fifteen minutes. It was a miracle, but none of us children were touched.

""By daybreak the firing had almost stopped, and through the window we could see shadows of men moving around inside the fort. The Mexicans went from room to room looking for an American to kill. While it was still dark a man stepped into the room and pointed his bayonet at my mother's breast, demanding:

""Where's the money the Americans had?""

""If they had any,' said my mother, ""you may look for it.'

""Then an officer stepped in and said:

""What are you doing? The women and children are not to be hurt.

""The officer then told my mother to pick out her own family and get her belongings and the other women were given the same instructions. When it was broad day the Mexicans began to remove the dead. There were so many killed that it took several days to carry them away.

""The families, with their baggage, were then sent under guard to the house of Don Ramon Musquiz, which was located where Frank Brothers store now is, on Main Plaza.(Southeast corner of Soledad and Commerce Streets, now a parking lot, 1991). Here we were given coffee and some food, and were told that we would go before the president at 2 o'clock. On our way to the Musquiz house we passed up Commerce street, and it was crowded as far as Presa street with soldiers who did not fire a shot during the battle. Santa Anna had many times more troops than he could use.

""At 3 o'clock we went before Santa Anna. His quarters were in a house which stood where L. Wolfson's store now is.(Middle of Commerce Street, north side, between Main Avenue and Soledad Street). He had a great stack of silver money on a table before him, and a pile of blankets. One by one the women were sent into a side room to make their declaration, and on coming out were given $2 and a blanket. While my mother was waiting her turn Mrs. Melton, who had never recognized my mother as an acquaintance, and who was considered an aristocrat, sent her brother, Juan Losoya, across the room to my mother to ask the favor that nothing be said to the president about her marriage with an American.

""My mother told Juan to tell her not to be afraid.

""Mrs. Dickson was there, also several other woman. After the president had given my mother her $2 and blanket, he told her she was free to go where she liked. We gathered what belongings we could together and went to our cousin's place on North Flores street, where we remained several months.""

I finished writing my first draft recently and was editing it last night at a coffee shop while hanging with my nevermo boyfriend. I was telling him that I feel like my character names all sound the same or are too basic. I then told him how I had heard years ago that some study was done where they analyzed the character names of multiple fictional books and found that, despite the authors' best efforts, the names were still somehow tied to each other and not actually a random smattering of names. At first they thought Lord of the Rings was the only fictional book/trilogy to have truly random names, but after further research they found that the names were actually similar to each other and not truly random or indicative of the randomness of real-life naming. BUT, the same test was done to the Book of Mormon and it was found that all 100+ names in the Book of Mormon are indeed super duper random and thus Joseph Smith could not have written the book himself. Amazing! As soon as I finished telling my boyfriend this story I paused for a moment then said, ""Actually, I don't think that's true."" I had retained this story in my head for over a decade and never questioned it, but now that I think about it that just sounds like some bullshit anecdote someone in the MFMC made up to strengthen the members' faith. Was anyone else ever told this story? Is that study even real? I can't think of how someone would define what it means for names in a story to be truly random since many people have pretty similar names depending on their geographic location, culture, and naming trends at the time of their birth.

While we were waiting on our food, I was stimming by tapping my knuckles. Mom told me to stop because it was making her nervous. She asked if I could play on my phone instead so I did. On the car ride home, I hand stimmed again. This time, I was only tapping my legs softly with my fingers, and mom once again asked me to stop because it was distracting her. She said she didn’t know why I just now do it like I haven’t been doing it my whole life. I told her that I just felt excited and needed to stim. I told her I didn’t see what the problem was and she replied, “Because you’re doing it.” After some more stimming, she started repeatedly banging her hand against her coffee cup in the cup carrier and was like “I guess this is what we’re doing now, annoying each other”. I then told her I can’t really control it, and she said “yes you can”. All that really pissed my brother off, mainly the cup thing. During the rest of the ride home, I was feeling very overwhelmed, and stimming would only make her angrier. When we got home, my brother told me to take care of myself down in my room. He had a serious talk with her while I was downstairs, sobbing because I was scared for him. I was covering my ears for most of it. I then heard my brother tell my mom to apologize to me, and she shouts, “I don’t need to apologize! I’m the adult and I can do whatever I want!” This argument went on for 30 minutes. I then heard my mom say “If you think my actions were childish, then that’s ok. But I did what I did to prove a point.” To be honest, I may have been scared during the whole thing, but that was the most immature behavior to come out of my own mother. Before you guys get to me, I did ask why my stimming was bothering her, but she didn’t answer. I don’t know how to take care of my sensory needs without upsetting her.

1j597a6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1j597a6/i_hate_my_mom/,I hate my mom,"My mom texted me while I was on the middle of a college class about how she needed to know my email. At the time I received the message I had stepped out for a little while to go to the bathroom because I drank too much coffee before class and really had to pee. I asked her why and she told me that my deceased grandmother promised her friend a piece of family land that was willed to me and my brother after she passed away in 2014 and she was giving a lawyer my email address so they could contact me about it. 

I was sort of confused about this because she died 11 years ago and this was the first I heard about her friend being given part of that land. Obviously I am not using my part of the land right now but I thought that I might make use of it later in life. You would think considering how long ago she died that all this would have been taken care of back then but no. I told her that I had to get back to class but wanted to call her afterwards, just because I was confused about the situation and wanted to know more about what was going on. I then turned my phone back off and went back to class.

Afterwards I called her and before I even opened my mouth she  started screaming at me. She screamed at me that there was nothing more to explain and she was fed up with having to spell things out for me and told me to just read the damn email. 

I became irritated and yelled back and told her I was sick and tired of her biting my head off for just asking a simple question. I am aware that I am a person with a learning disability born into a family of geniuses who often become impatient with me because my brain doesn’t work as quickly or as efficiently as theirs. I realize that it’s very easy for them to become frustrated with someone like me but I am sick of dealing with this sort of behavior from her and my brother every time I have to talk to either one of them.

She says I am the volatile one. I shouldn’t have yelled but I approached her with the intent of having a reasonable discussion and she blew up with me before I even had the chance to speak, which is something she does very frequently. I wish every day I was born into a family of people with average intelligence because maybe they would have slightly more patience with me.",3,1741303138.0,Vent,6,1.0,False
1j5978x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5978x,I lost both of my babies in less than 6 months,"First 2 pics are Tiny, 2nd 2 are Harriett.
Harriet is just asleep in the last photo.
My baby girl Harriett had a procedure to remove a massive tumor on October 3rd 2024. She had a 50/50 chance of surviving, and she excelled. The tumor that she had was cancerous, and it was on her fat pad. The vet said he had never seen a cancer like this before and doubted he would ever see it again.
 On October 11th, while she was still in recovery, my baby boy Tiny started not eating, so I took him to the vet. They ran some blood work, and I was waiting on results. The vet did not have any serious concerns at the time, and sent him home with me. He seemed okay, so I left for work and when I came home that night he had passed away. It was so sudden and shocking and I was completely unprepared. It turns out that he had a completely different kind of cancer, and his would have been untreatable. He was 6 years old, and I had him since he was a baby. I spoke with the vet about all of their feeding, husbandry, everything like that and we couldn't find anything in their care that was lacking or that would have caused cancer in either of them. I even checked our apartment and bath tub for lead. On Monday I took Harriet to the vet because she hadn't been eating well, and had some fluid building up in her belly. The vet was able to drain the fluid, but did confirm that her cancer is coming back, and after she recovered from the draining we were going to look in to what we were going to do going forward. For the past 4 days I had stayed with her just hanging out, making sure she had everything that she needed and was comfortable. Yesterday I laid down to take a nap from noon until 2:00 p.m., and when I woke up she had passed away. She was 8 1/2 years old, I got her when she was 2.
I cannot express how absolutely devastated I am, I've lost my best friends. For 6 years they've sat with me every morning while I had my coffee. The very first thing I've done every morning for years has been make their breakfast and talk to them. Now I wake up and there's no one there, no scaly faces, and the living room is so dark with the lights out. I know you can never replace them. There's never going to be any dragon like either one of them, and I'll never have them back. I just feel so empty and lonely. When Tiny passed I still had Harriett, but with both of them gone I'm just so lost. I am trying to reach out to a local college that I heard is doing research on reptile cancer, the vet said they're doing chemo on a snake. I'm hoping that maybe they might be able to get some samples from her and do some research. Maybe help future beardies live happier and healthier lives.
I don't feel right Bringing home Another lizard so soon, but I don't know how long I can sit here in this dark living room by myself. How long have you all waited before bringing lizards back into your life when one has passed?",15,1741303136.0,BeardedDragons,5,1.0,False
1j5974s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/1j5974s/sorry_bailey/,Sorry Bailey.,"I was approached at the Ridge by a seemingly nice young lady who inquired about my job and where I’d like to be in 5 years. After some small talk and complimenting me, Bailey asked for my number so we could grab coffee and discuss her entrepreneurial side hustle (red flag). Tbh I thought she was hitting on me and so I subtly made it clear I was taken but she reached out and we setup time to meet so I figured WTH. 

During our coffee date, the conversation seemed forced by her. She kept talking about her friend Shannon and how she’s successful without having to work blah blah blah. Bailey mentioned how she is phasing out her day job because the side hustle Shannon got her into is going sooooo well. Throughout the first 15 minutes she mentioned “books”, “only spending time with quality people”, “being your best self” and asked lots of pointed personal questions. 

My tingly senses started to go off and I asked what she was selling and how the side hustle worked. All the answers were vague but it was something along the lines of “instead of buying your essential goods at Costco you buy it privately” and building a “network”. She said Shannon runs a free info session I could come to. When I inquired about the name she seemed hesitate to share but eventually I got “nutrilite”.


I asked if it was an MLM and she seemed shocked/upset responding “yes, but not all MLMs are the same. What’s your experience been?”.  I said I had no interest in joining an MLM and couldn’t believe that she only wanted to meet up to sell me something. She said “I’m so offended right now, I’m not trying to sell you anything”. SURE. Then she started trying to compliment me again saying “you are such a successful motivated woman”. Seems like she was trying to rope me back in so I got up and left haha.

Sorry Bailey, you seemed like a nice person. It’s sad you got roped into a scam and think praying on people is okay. If someday you leave, text me and let’s be friends.

Anyways, Amway the MLM/cult/Pyramid Scheme is (still) active in Bozeman. It sucks because they are praying on people wanting to make genuine connections.

My concern is that it'll be a waste because of how high my tolerance is and I won't know how to use the powder afterwards because it'll be with coffee grounds. Doesn't the hot water concentrate the alkaloids in a way? So it sort of makes it more potent than a regular drink with powder in it? Any tips, tricks, or advice will be appreciated.

I feel like I hear this a ton from articles I've read, social media posts I've seen, or various night owls ranting about the unfairness of it. And I just don't get it. I think that CAPITALISM was build for Morning Larks. But COMMUNITY is build for Night Owls. 

Think about it. Standard business hours are 9am-5pm. This if more towards morning people for sure, with some overlap at the end of the work day. But what is actually open before 9am vs after 5pm? Before 9am, weekdays or weekends, no matter where I go (in USA at least), I can only rely on:

\--coffee shops  
\--gyms  
\--gas stations  
\--grocery stores  
\--on weekends I get a Farmer's Market at 8 or 9am at the earliest

So, I can work and be productive. It is AFTER work in the evening hours that almost all the socializing happens! That's when you can go to the theater, the club, a jazz bar, a cooking class, a paint n sip night, an escape room, an adults only zoo event, axe throwing, comedy club, movie theater (some have 10am showings, but this has mostly stopped or gotten later since covid), and on and on. Even my local library is open 10am-9pm!

I love being a morning persona and have been one my whole life. I'm an introvert and outdoorsy, so it lends itself well to me being able to have a beautiful vista all to myself at sunrise and beat the crowds in popular outdoor areas.

I moved too slow for the job, and I had a hard time remembering how to make things. They also wanted things to look a certain way, and I never got the hang of it.

The story follows a couple that moves to Ireland for love, detailing the formation and breakdown of the relationship. It is my first serious writing attempt so I am sure there's a lot wrong with it but I am looking to improve it as much as I can. It deals with mental health issues and substance abuse and can be a little heavy but also I hope kind of funny too. I've included a small bit below.

Sample:

It wasn’t until we were standing in an open air market selling fish that it occurred to me we were actually in Italy. There was nothing more to plan and our only obligation was to simply live as a married couple. I felt weightless.  Having watched endless travel shows we felt as if we were more cultured with cuisine than other tourists. We would eat arancini for lunch from a stall then walk around the labyrinth of cobblestone streets while we killed time before our next meal, looking at pottery or dusty knives in the endless stalls before having an espresso and a Chesterfield. My only mission outside of the bedroom was food. I would specifically ask for what I was sure a tourist wouldn’t ask for: sea urchins with pasta, langoustine, tongue with pesto, though I could never find someone selling offal from a covered basket despite all my searching. The waiters would nod enthusiastically, thinking I’d order macaroni and cheese no doubt, but roll their eyes when after all my searching I’d point to the second least expensive bottle of red. Hopefully I’d tip like an American, I could almost hear them thinking.\\

We drove along a route I had mapped out during lunch breaks at work but had no idea what to expect. We would stop to get lunch in little seaside towns that were staffed by people so friendly I wondered if they mistook us for someone else. When we arrived in Siricusa everything seemed like it was going to crumble into the sea from sheer age and seemed sandblasted from salt. The cathedral in the heart of town towered over tables set up in the square that belonged to the cafes. The waiters were always amused when they heard me ask for an ashtray in my best Italian and they would set my little potacenere down and we would spend the entire evening drinking prosecco and a glass of pale yellow limoncello would be thrown in when we told them it was our honeymoon. We would spend the nights talking about how the wedding went and looking for the next spot to have a drink at. Only very rarely would we be too drunk to make love, which was an unending pursuit for us.

By the middle of the trip we had made our way to the middle of Sicily on our way to Palermo. It was October and all the trees were colors I had forgotten the way red leaves looked in Autumn. They filled these dips where the road dipped down in between them before going back up. You could see for miles at the tops of those mountains and it showed that the path would continue to wind through another valley and I would brace my consciousness to remember this beauty. Some of the little towns we went to were completely deserted. The houses were beautiful stone and with terracotta roofs turned grey by time, and vines grew out of the broken windows. In the middle of town sometimes there would be a cafe with a few people sitting at a bar but I didn’t feel brave enough to even use their toilet; whatever they were doing in these ruins felt sinister. They could be the ghosts that haunted this town for all I knew. A ruined castle at the top of the hill with a gate barring entrance. We got out to stretch our legs and, while taking in the crispness that high altitude lent air, Evelyn yelped with pain. I looked at her and she clutched her chest. Had she been shot? No, a rock had fallen from God knows where and hit her in the chest. We looked to see the source but silence abounded and there was not a soul that could have thrown it. Had a bird dropped it trying and failing to recreate the death of Aeschylus? I rushed over to her and she was nervous but said she wasn’t hurt, she was just startled.

The town of Petralia Soprana was like the ghost town but alive. Entering town we were met with olive trees in the dusty hills before the roads became more narrow and turned to cobblestone. There seemed to be a church for every twenty people in the town, and inside them were statues of saints with arrows penetrating every limb. I would light two candles, one for Evelyn’s mother and one for my favorite aunt. The town square was populated with cafes and fountains and children playing loudly and bright clothes on washing lines above us and old men sitting on benches smoking cigarettes. As we sat at a table and I lit up a cigarette of my own I would look at them enviously. They had it all figured out. These men would spend all day chatting without a care in the world, have some coffee, and return home to a simple meal of local meats and herbs made by some eternally youthful raven-haired, olive-skinned Calypso.

I have to admit, at first I fell for it; she cried CONSTANTLY throughout last week’s Sunday Oscar night episode. (RIP Alec’s once-nominated career) and I did think sometimes her tears were genuine. But the. I remembered how calculated this all is for the cameras, and that’s the idea: humanize and “soften” an unlikeable individual. Show that they have vulnerable feelings and that they, too, are human.

Not for nuthin’, but if I habitually drank fishbowls full of afternoon wine, took “ADHD meds” (diet pills and stimulants), never ate food, lived off of black coffee and plastic surgery “recovery meds,” I’d probably be a tearful mess, too.

In a world dominated by centralized banks, clunky financial systems, and outdated transaction methods, Bitcoin has emerged as the ultimate rebel. But let’s be real—while Bitcoin is revolutionary, sending and receiving it isn’t always smooth sailing. Long wallet addresses? Mistyped transactions? Vanished funds? It’s a mess.

That’s where [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in—an app designed to make Bitcoin transactions easier, faster, and practically foolproof. If you’re tired of fighting against the odds in the crypto world, buckle up. We’re about to show you how a simple QR code can change everything.

# The Battle Against Crypto Complexity

Crypto is supposed to be the future, right? But let’s face it—most people are still struggling to wrap their heads around it. Between exchanges, wallets, gas fees, and private keys, the whole system can feel like an exclusive club with a secret handshake.

Want to send Bitcoin to a friend? Hope you enjoy copying and pasting that 34-character wallet address, praying you don’t miss a letter. Accepting Bitcoin for your business? Get ready for a headache when customers fumble with their wallets, mistype your address, and ask you a hundred times if they’re doing it right.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Bitcoin QR codes cut through the confusion. Instead of memorizing or mistyping a long string of characters, you can just scan and send. No errors, no lost funds, just seamless transactions. It’s like upgrading from dial-up to fiber-optic internet—why suffer when the better option exists?

# The Magic of Bitcoin QR Codes

You might be wondering, ""How does a simple QR code defy the odds?"" Well, let’s break it down:
