1g9izwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/igcse/comments/1g9izwj/can_you_guys_grade_my_0500_descriptive_writing/,Can you guys grade my 0500 descriptive writing essay exercise? The prompt is: Describe the people in a park at different times of the year,"I stood tall on my cobblestone podium; hands outstretched with the face of the park's founder. I stood tall for I could not sit, as my flesh was stone and skin plated with bronze. I lived up to the founder's name as I stood where he stood, when he was alive, to survey this park. I had a birds' eye view of the rolling hills, the tulip field and the lake that shhimmers like stardust after dark. I felt the searing sun beat upon my skin in the summer, and the frigid winters left icicles in my beard and an itch with no relief. The elements were unrelenting, so during those unbearable days, I'd turn a stony gaze to the people.

 

In the spring, there were always children. A group that often caught my eye was a ragtag army of eight-year-olds who arrived at the park smelling freshly bathed with citrus body wash, and yet would return home with sweat marks splattered on their shirts like Rorschach tests. They shrieked with laughter as a boy faceplanted into the mud attempting to catch a ball. They sounded indistinguishable from the chattering of hummingbirds that swarmed the tulip field, far from the children's chaos. Their disgruntled parents sat on the park benches, their feet tapping the ground in increasing impatience as evening slipped by the horizon. Still, at the children's pleas for five more minutes, they simply sighed and tried to smooth out their deepening smile lines as they grumbled in agreement.

 

The seasons would shift like hands on a clockface; as the blue sky hung over the park like an overbearing mother, marathoners with their neon muscle shirts pierced the landscape. Their gasps and heaves filled the air with a laden humidity, and some of them crouched over with their hands pressed against their knees, sweat beads rolling down and picking up speed as droplets merged together, running down in their own little marathon down the atheletes' necks and backs. On Fridays, a couple with sun-bleached hair would share a sundae under the trees. The woman pointed out the flora and fauna enthusiastically with her gel painted nails (that varied in colour and design weekly), as the man, unbeknownst to her, stared at her in stoic silence. His eyes shined in the July sun as if she were the only sun he'd seen. The woman gestured frantically at the field, at the lake, and then at the trees. Her threads of golden hair danced like wisps in the wind and her partner threaded his fingers through hers, head leaning on her bony shoulders as he closed his eyes in pure bliss.

 

The leaves shifted to warm, firey shades and fell off the trees in a kaleidoscopic pattern. A group of teenage girls left an audible crunch stepping upon them, pumpkin spice lattes in hand. They wore tan boots and cabled cardigans, their sloping beanies nearly falling off their dark brown hair. They murmured in a hushed voice, reminiscent of white noise in a coffee shop. The scent of their drinks wafted through the air, smelling like clove and autumn themed candles. As they passed by me, the girl called Emily lamented the eventual end of the season.

 

Weeks after she said so, the frost barged in without knocking. Plants shrivelled up in hibernation, and the sun reflected across the snow, giving it an ethereal glow. Cold winds brushed past dark mahogany branches, as if they were in a hurry to raise gooseflesh and send chills down spines. A spot of black wool formed a clearer image as she trailed closer to me, down the hill from the cemetery. An old woman with silver hair in a tight bun was bundled up in black puffer jackets and knitted scarves; her lips were cracked and the tip of her nose pink. With every laboured breath she waded through the layers of frost, letting out puffs of hot air and a single pair of footprints going as far as the eye can see. And as far as the eye could see, she once more blurred into a tiny blob in the distance, leaving snowtrails as my only company, until spring comes alive again.",1,1729606035.0,igcse,0,1.0,False
1g9iztw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g9iztw/gents_and_ladies_if_you_feel_inclined_how_would/,Gents (and ladies if you feel inclined): how would you approach this?,"I've (35m) been out with this woman (35f), who's a friend of someone i know, a couple of times. The first time was just a quick meet-up at a cafe to introduce one another, and then the second time, we went to Liverpool for the day together. Neither times did anything sexual occur, although the second time, I managed to kiss her on the cheek without her cringing, which I'm counting as a win. 

Anyway, we agreed to go for a coffee at Starbucks (I've never been and she  said she would introduce me to it) and then she went off the radar for around a week, before messaging me yesterday saying that she hadn't been well with labyrinthitis (an inner ear infection that makes you feel like shit), and this combined with the medication her doctor had given her had made her just want to sleep all day (which is why she hadn't replied to the last message I sent her). She then confirmed that Starbucks was still a go-ahead, and we settled on a day and time. The thing is, how do I approach this? In my last relationship, by the end of date 3, we had slept together (we ended up living together for around a year before things fell apart and we split). I admittedly rushed that one, as I was just keen and happy to have some female attention/companionship. 

This time, I want to take things steady, but also do want whatever 'this' is, to develop and become something more than just another friendzone. Do I go in there with the feeling that we'll become more romantic/sexual/eventually exclusive, etc, or do I just go there and be an emotional stone? 

I should point out that this woman has told me that she's not very touchy-feely, so maybe that's the way she is with everyone (not just people she has no intention of dating).

Any advice would be most welcome (sorry for the long-winded post).",1,1729606029.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1g9ixm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalWizards/comments/1g9ixm5/comprehensive_guide_to_digital_marketing_for/,Comprehensive Guide to Digital Marketing for Local Businesses: Best Practices,"For local businesses, digital marketing can be a powerful tool to reach nearby customers. Here are some best practices to follow:

**1. Optimize Your Google My Business (GMB) Listing**

This is crucial for local businesses. Ensure your GMB profile is complete and accurate with your business name, address, phone number, hours, and photos. Encourage customers to leave reviews, as positive reviews boost your visibility in local searches.

**Tip**: Respond to reviews (both good and bad) to show you value customer feedback.

**2. Leverage Local SEO**

Local SEO helps your business show up in searches specific to your area. Focus on keywords that include your location (e.g., “best coffee shop in \[city\]”). Also, make sure your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) is consistent across all online platforms, from your website to directories like Yelp.

**Tip**: Add location-based keywords to your website's title tags, meta descriptions, and content.

**3. Use Social Media to Engage Locally**

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Nextdoor allow you to connect directly with your local community. Post regularly about promotions, events, or behind-the-scenes content. Local hashtags and geotagging your posts can also help you reach more people in your area.

**Example**: Use hashtags like #YourCityName to attract local users.

**4. Invest in Targeted Local Ads**

Platforms like Google Ads and Facebook Ads let you target users based on geographic location. For local businesses, this is a cost-effective way to reach potential customers who are nearby. You can run ads that only appear to people within a certain radius of your business.

**Tip**: Use call-to-action phrases like “Visit us today” or “Stop by our location” to drive foot traffic.

**5. Create Locally Relevant Content**

Content marketing isn’t just for big brands. Writing blogs or creating videos that address local interests, community events, or neighborhood-specific topics can attract local customers. Highlight how your business is involved in the community or how it solves local problems.

**Example**: A bakery could write a blog post about local sourcing or upcoming community events it’s catering for.

**6. Encourage Online Reviews**

Positive reviews build trust and help with search engine rankings. Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews on Google, Yelp, or other relevant platforms. Make it easy by providing links or a simple call-to-action.

**Tip**: Send follow-up emails thanking customers for their purchase and kindly ask for a review.

**7. Email Marketing for Local Customers**

Create an email list of local customers to keep them updated on promotions, events, or new services. Personalize emails to offer exclusive local deals or invite them to special in-store events.

**Tip**: Include a “forward to a friend” option to extend your reach within the local community.

**8. Partner with Other Local Businesses**

Collaborating with neighboring businesses for cross-promotions can expand your reach. For example, if you’re a local gym, partner with a nearby health food store to offer discounts to each other’s customers.

**Example**: Host a joint event, giveaway, or social media contest with another local business.

**9. Use Online Listings and Directories**

Aside from Google, ensure your business is listed on Yelp, TripAdvisor, Bing Places, and other relevant directories. The more visibility you have across various platforms, the more likely local customers will find you.

**Tip**: Update your listings regularly to ensure consistency.

**10. Host Local Events (Both Virtual and In-Person)**

Hosting events, like workshops, classes, or virtual tours, is a great way to engage with your local audience. Promote these events online through your website, social media, and email marketing to attract attendees.

**Tip**: After the event, share photos or videos to keep the engagement going.

For local businesses, the goal of digital marketing is to build strong connections within the community while making it easy for customers to find and interact with you. By focusing on local SEO, engaging social media, and consistent customer interaction, you can boost your visibility and grow your customer base.

I was at a seminar, we were told to leave our luggage on benches. After the seminar we came back to see people taking off with our bags.

When questioned, the person took off running, he went through a door down several flights of stairs to a vast series of connected rooms and hall ways.

The luggage theft seems to be big business. There were thousands of suit cases, trunks and bags, stacked neatly and in random piles.

Few of the people spoke English, I had the sensation that I did not belong there.

I found a person I could talk to and he let me look around for my bag, no luck.

The lecture was boring, I had awful seating, bad audio. I did get a good cup of coffee. The Barista looked stressed, I kidded with her, but she was not having it. I gave her an extra big tip that surprised her. US dollars were the currency. A small coffee was $2.75, not bad for a kiosk.

1g9ito6,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1g9ito6/roommate_hid_all_the_toilet_paper_and_other_petty/,Roommate hid all the toilet paper and other petty things,"

I’ll admit I’m not the most perfect roommate myself. Get irritated easily, like to be alone, sometimes forget my laundry but Jesus Christ. 

2 weeks from moving away from my worst roommate ever. She’s not gross, messy or anything like that but just plain rude and inconsiderate. I got her as a roommate because I thought she seemed nice and pretty busy - working and in college. 

I get that we both pay rent and have equal rights to be at the house, but when I say she’s constantly home, I mean constantly. Maybe at best leaves the house for 3 hours (from 1-4 when I WFH 2 days a week). When she comes home she’s on the phone with her friends or she has a friend with her. I’m less annoyed that’s she’s home constantly since I’m leaving soon but I just don’t understand how she affords rent and groceries? It’s also time for midterms and she’s still always hanging out with her friends. She’s home less now that we do not get along. 

She cooks elaborate meals with her friends as an activity in our hallway size kitchen. Multiple times a week. I’m talking breads, shrimp curries, cookies from scratch. Cinnamon rolls from scratch from 7 PM - 10 PM. Fills 2/3 of the fridge with her leftovers. Would be ok if I could try some but I wouldn’t ask and she’s only offered once (we are not on good terms). 

Insulted me for never cooking and always using the microwave (hmm wonder why) and then I caught her using (my) microwave. Which wouldn’t have been a problem but she doesn’t even let me use dish soap she bought. Given, I had lived there a year before her so she had used everything that was mine. 

Insulted me for leaving crumbs around sometimes, which I’m sure I do, I’m human, while she had a bunch of bananas in her cabinet literally rotting and attracting flies. 

I moved the pants she had on the top of the washer for a month and she sent me a very angry text about it telling me to ask her to do it. I told her to just pick up her stuff. She said she’d move my things then and I said ok. She moved the hand soap from the counter… I ended up moving my literally all of my things in the end. 

Hid all her toilet paper from me so when I went to pee I was… rudely surprised. I figured we had come to terms on that one since she used my paper towels but I guess not. Had to run to the store during work. 

She also moved my flower I was pressing in between two books onto my white vinyl album so now it’s stained. 

She insulted me for forgetting a towel in the dryer and hang drying something I was spot cleaning. I said, thanks for reminding me. Then, she immediately forgot a bunch of laundry the next day.

Films the arguments we have which makes me very uncomfortable. During this filming I mentioned the rules we agreed on before living together and she said “is that in writing”. Did not think I had to get a legal document for you to be considerate in the apartment we share. Keeps bringing up the fact that I swear at her, sorry I’m not religious and don’t think much about swearing when I’m angry. Some people swear some don’t. I swear. 

One she did not film was me asking her if she planned on moving out and she said “I’m above speaking to you” which was awesome. I pretended to bow down to her because it was funny. She later accused me (during filming) of thinking I’m above her. 

Constantly breaks the rules we set beforehand and is shocked when I’m upset. Does not set boundaries with her guests at all. 

Tried to move a giant (office sized) desk into her upstairs bedroom. Our staircase is incredibly narrow and she scuffed the walls very badly. The worst part was, she was moving this from 11-11:30 (we had agreed guests were to be out by 10:30) on a weeknight. Her friends were there to help since 8. I was going to get up to pee, and the door wouldn’t open because the desk was there in the hallway. She asked if I could open my door to let it by this bump. I said no and told her to stop moving the desk right now. They didn’t so I told them to get the fuck out and that I didn’t want to see that guy again because he had called me crazy or angry or something. He was over a lot after that. 

She said she was going to throw it away with a very sad face and I said ok. I could tell by looking at it that it was too big to fit upstairs. 

Also, I tried to make the rules slightly more structured because at first I thought she was reasonable. But she wasn’t. So I tried to add on having no guests unattended since one morning I woke up and her friend was in our (only) bathroom washing her face in a bathrobe and my roommate was not home. I told her this was not ok (made me uncomfortable to have strangers in the house alone!) and she *summarizing* said “well I’d never leave you alone with a man and I wasn’t gone for long.” I was focusing on what you were doing, not what you weren’t. 

During us not agreeing (which started about a month into us living together) she locked the chain lock of the door. Which is fine as long as I’m home too. But she’d do it when I wasn’t home. I told her I was uncomfortable with that, it’s my house too and to not do it again. Her reasoning was for safety and I told her to get a ring door bell then. I was afraid she’d lock me out of the house. I thought we had resolved that until one day I came home with my groceries and had to pound on the door for her to come down. I told her she couldn’t do that again and she said she would. So I unscrewed the lock from the door. 

Always did her schoolwork in the dining room with the volume playing out loud. Right below my bedroom. I eventually donated the dining room table since I’m moving. 

Just recently caught her trying to eat breakfast on my nice leather couch. I told her you can’t eat on the couch and she said she wasn’t, with a bowl of food she had set down on the coffee table as she was turning the TV on…

If you’re asking: where should she eat, there’s no dining table. I eat in my bed, but it’s her apartment too so she can just get a dining room table she’s not incapable. 

Wouldn’t pay her utility bills this month and acted like she wasn’t getting my texts because I blocked her. I unblocked her to send them and they all marked delivered. I put notes up all over the house when she was late about it. Eventually did pay them after calling me a delusional weirdo. I removed them from my name ASAP. If she wasn’t getting them, maybe I do seem delusional, but I wasn’t about to talk to her in person and get filmed again. 

Calls me a liar when all I’ve ever done is try to uphold the rules we set before. We agreed on those rules for a reason, for our peace. 

Also, the reasoning she uses for all of this is because I “cussed her out” which is partially true. I swore, mostly at her friends, to leave. Then again, I shouldn’t have to do that to uphold a rule we pre-established that you can’t enforce for yourself. 

I tried enforcing it (guests out by 10:30) kindly a few times, reminding her, telling her how it made me feel. But at the end of the day, I’m not her friend, I’m not her mother. I’m not gentle parenting some 20 year old girl. Get your friends the fuck out of our house when they’re not supposed to be there. 

Anyways! I’m so excited to move into a 1 bedroom place. No more roommate troubles.

*Naples Harbour*

Naples had once been a great naval power. Unfortunately, the House of Borgia had never been. So shipmaster Raffaello will not often cross the wharfs to his favorite coffee-shop before his shift to work at the drydocks in the harbour, being a shipmaster is still a fairly coveted position enjoying many privileges and benefits in the grand city of Naples, thus he enjoyed a very healthy wage and benefits, nevertheless the work that is needed is long and time consuming and also involves dealing with the representatives of the Borgias.

A set of big ships. For the fleet. You know, like the other powers have.

Shipmaster Raffaello sighs. Hulls, a few. The Neapolitan navy definitely not bolstered and renovated into a gargantuan.

But it was a start.

Currently trying to work down from 1400 to 1200 calories a day, and I'm just getting to the point where I hate food. I thought I was a foodie and that I loved eating, but now I've been off junk food for a bit I think I was just a food addict that was eating emotionally.

Now that I'm in a callorie deficit though, and I'm choosing foods based off of purely nutrition and how full it will make me, food just feels like a chore. I don't look forward to eating, and if anything I just feel guilt after eating because it wasn't worth the callories.

It's all genuinely exhausting. I spend so much time every day measuring out every teaspoon of every ingredient I use and adding it up, and end up with a meal that I can't even finish. Sometimes I don't wanna eat at all because it just feels like I'm going to waste callories or put weight on. I don't even want to eat junk food really, and the occasional indulgence (ex: coffee with a syrup) just isn't enjoyable the way it used to me. 

I guess it's a good thing because I'll be less inclined to overeat and get fat again when the weight starts shifting, but I miss being able to go to restaurants or fast food with friends. Tried the other day and the lowest calorie item was like 650 calories.",1,1729605149.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I also have a subscription to NordVPN. 

I also set up a tailscale connection to my home NAS but that is still not hiding my home's public IP address from a potential bad guy. And I cant use Tailscale alongside a NordVPN connection.

A)      I basically only created an account for this sub-reddit – it has helped me tremendously with all the questions I have had since fostering the ‘advanced running’ mindset roughly 18-months ago. Perhaps this is my turn to share some of the things I have learnt and applied to reach my goals.

 

B)      To reminisce my training and race as I type. This was a big milestone for me, and something, I hope, worth sharing.

**Short-hand Background:**

29M. Running for just short of 18-months. In the first 6-months I lost 20-25kg in weight, and thus, my times improved dramatically across 5k, 10k and 10 miles (I hadn’t run or raced any distance beyond this at that stage).

From the start of 2024, I began my first Marathon training block (TB A), having signed up for Manchester & Edinburgh marathon in April & May, respectively.

|Marathon|Date|Chip Time|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Manchester|14th April 2024|3:07:52|
|Edinburgh|26th May 2024|3:03:10|

Motivated by my progress, and close to a time I once never thought remotely possible for me (sub 3:00), I entered Poznan Marathon and therefore, executed a second training block (TB B) over the summer.

||TB A|TB B|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Duration**|16 Weeks|14 Weeks|
|**Base Build Weeks**|Yes (4)|No|
|**Av Weekly Volume**|66|72|
|**Peak Volume**|100 KM (x1)|105 KM (x3)|
|**Total Volume**|1,058 KM|1,007 KM|
|**Runs per week**|3.93|4.3|
|**Runs over 30 KM**|2|3|
|**Training Races**|0|2|
|**Sessions missed through injury / illness**|7|4|



**Training:**

For TB B, 14-weeks specifically for Poznan marathon and sub 3:00, I averaged 79km per week for the first 12 weeks, reduced to 72km average across 14-weeks due to a 2-week taper.

Main changes from TB A include;

·        Designated races as part of training block

·        Sunday Long Runs incorporate intervals @ MP

·        Reduced weeks as carrying fitness from TB A into TB B

·        3 x Yasso 800 Sessions to track/monitor progress (week 1, 7 & 12)

 

My plan consists of 5 runs a week. 3 x easy pace, volume runs, 1 x intervals/track session, 1 x long run with MP intervals. Training races would replace Sunday long run.

Track/Interval sessions included a rotation of;

·        Yasso 800’s

·        Progressive 1k Repeats

·        20x1 min intervals

·        3x2x1 min intervals

·        10 min @ 10k pace, 5 x 3 min @ 5k pace, 10 min @ 10k pace

Sunday long runs started at 26k and ramped up to 35k. Within that, MP segments started at around 40% of the total volume and peaked at 66% of the total volume of the run.

The most difficult long run sessions I did, which felt most beneficial also as they gave me confidence, were;

·        2k warm up > 5 x 4k @ HM Pace (4:05km) w/ 2k float > 3k cool down = 35k

((20k HM pace (57%) 15k wu, cd or float (43%)))

·        1k warm up > 21.2k @ MP > 10k cool down = 32.2k

(((21.2k MP (66%) 11k wu or cd (34%)))

Overall, the training block went very well. In my mind I felt I couldn’t have prepared much better, so I went into the taper and Marathon with no regrets and backed myself.

For what it’s worth, my PB’s across lower distances were all relatively recent going into this sub-3:00 attempt;

|Distance|Time|
|:-|:-|
|5k|18:24|
|10k|37:53|
|HM|1:25:14|



**Pre-Race:**

I started my day with coffee, an electrolyte drink, and a large bagel with butter and jam, all consumed 2.5 to 3 hours before the marathon. A light 10-minute jog took me to the start line amidst heavy rain, but a last-minute forecast promised a damp marathon with dry spells, boosting my spirits. The Poznan marathon kicks off outside the international fairs building, allowing runners to gather indoors and stay warm, before heading to the start line at the very last moment.

**The Race:**

Having struggled with positive splits in my previous marathons, I aimed for even pacing this time. My strategy was to ensure my first kilometer was my slowest, to help manage my heart rate and control my adrenaline. Early on, I started about 10 meters behind two 3-hour pacers, forming a small group that mostly stuck together until the halfway mark. As the race progressed, the gap to the 3-hour pack widened to about 100 meters. Despite this, my watch indicated that my splits were on-pace.

I crossed the halfway point in 1:30:06, about a minute slower than planned. Realising I needed to negative split the second half, I started to push myself, with kilometers 22 and 23 becoming my fastest at a pace of 4:09/km. From kilometers 24 to 30, I focused on gradually regaining time, aiming for splits of 4:10 to 4:15/km. I felt strong but was aware that the real challenge lay ahead.

At 30K, I took my fourth SIS Beta Fuel gel, this one however, was enhanced with nootropics. Having trained with them, I found they significantly delayed fatigue. I gained confidence as I overtook many runners who were starting to falter. Surpassing the 32K and 35K marks without feeling depleted was a revelation for me, having bonked at these distances in Manchester & Edinburgh.

By 35K, emotions surged as the reality of a sub-3:00 marathon dawned on me. Thoughts of my son would make my eyes well up, but I quickly tried to remain in control of my emotions – I still had 7k to go. I noticed some discomfort in my big toes, possibly due to the wider toe box of an Alphafly 3, and also opted to take half of my spare gel to help me to the finish. In the past I have had GI issues at this stage, but not today.

At 38K, I experienced a pivotal moment of belief - I really believed I would do it. Urging myself onward, I began to feel the familiar end-of-marathon pain, something the nootropics had done so well to mask until now. My hamstrings ached, but I stayed focused, hitting 4:16/km and 4:14/km splits. Crossing the 40K marker in 2:50:16, I calculated that I could slow down and still achieve a sub-3:00 finish. I had caught the 3-hour pack, but they began to pull away in the final kilometer.

Turning onto the blue carpet, I spotted my partner and friends to the left, and I celebrated with fist pumps into the air, confirming what I assume they already knew from tracking me – that I was going to do it. As I approached the finish line, the clock ticked into 2:59:XX. Overcome with emotion, I remember clenching my fists, looking to the sky and shouting, “I f\*cking did it!”- a moment immortalized in a photo that captures my triumph (thank you photographer!). I finished in 2:59:25, marking my third marathon and my first European race. I was the first British runner to cross the line, which was a nice bonus.

**Post-Race:** 

Now, nine days post-marathon, I reflect on the experience with gratitude & disbelief. Achieving a sub-3:00 marathon feels surreal, especially considering how lost I felt just 18 months ago. I took a full week off running, enjoying a fair few alcoholic beverages – something I have abstained from during TB A and TB B.

As the glow of success begins to fade, I find myself contemplating the future. Pre-marathon, I was consumed with the goal of a sub-3:00 finish, without it, I feel a little lost. I have a place in next year’s London Marathon, so training will resume in January 2025, but I need to redefine my goals to reignite my motivation. The obvious choice I suppose is to continue chasing times, but that’s a large time commitment, especially with a young family.

A big thank you to the advanced running community here also. The advice here has massively supplemented and influenced my training for the better.

Do you feel completely different from your first wife ? Do you ever get over your first wife? Or do you always wait for the shoe to drop? Sorry I worded this nuts. First coffee.

1g9ieu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1g9ieu6/how_to_be_ok_with_being_alone_again/,How to be ok with being alone again?,"For context, 18f. Therefore I can't go to bars or do fully ""adult"" things yet. I also do not have a full license yet nor a car.

I've been alone for as long as I can remember, I've never had many friends, I've had a few relationships but never a group of friends. This has never bothered me too much previously, being alone was fine. I could do what I wanted without needing input and never had plans outside of work so I had plenty of free time.

That was my life for years, even before I was old enough to work I was home schooled and often spent my time studying or watching movies to keep myself entertained. It never bothered me before, but I've noticed recently that I'm starting to feel lonely. I don't exactly keep friends well, I'm an out of sight out of mind person and it's not fair for someone to have to always text or call first because I can't remember they exist unless I see them (gotta love adhd.) and while I'm working on it, I'm not yet in a place to manage the responsibility of being a friend.

However, as I go through the motions I'm starting to feel sad doing things I once enjoyed doing alone, like going out window shopping or going to get coffee. Things that I was once ok with doing alone just seems boring now.

I'm not exactly looking for advice to find friends, because let's be real- I'm in a small town and everyone my age is already close knit and not taking new people,  and people I do find are often too old to be friends with an 18yr old even if we have insightful discussions. I'm looking for advice on how to go back to enjoying being alone.

I wouldn't say it's depression, all other areas of my life are fine- if not better, I'm getting back into hobbies I once enjoyed and I'm living my best life in all other aspects aside from friendship. I imagine this is something that can be easily fixed with some mind reframing so I'm hoping people here can help. 

Direct questions I'm wanting answers to:

How did you feel at peace with being alone again if you have ever felt a tinge of loneliness?

How did you prevent the loneliness from coming back?

I'm the type that's usually okay alone so I don't really know how to deal with this.",1,1729604480.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

So two months ago she dumped me, didn't try to talk to me first about how she felt. Reason she left me is that she lost the love for me, she told me she wanted to keep in touch and stay friends with me which I agreed on because I still really loved her and didnt want to lose her for good and maybe think of a plan to get her back. Recently I broke no contact after 2 months and wanted to see her for a coffee and see how she is but she cut me of, told be she cant be friends with me and blocked me from all platforms.
It hurts like hell, even more so than the day she brokenup with me because now ill never see her again. She was kind, beautiful and shared so manny interests as I did. I really dont think I can find anyone better than she was...

Regarding flavour. Initially very normal flavour. However, goat milk is more tangy than cows milk. So the tangyness blends in very well with the coffee flavours, and the bitterness of the espresso. Sort of complementing each other, and reducing the punchyness of both, while rounding everything off. 


The aftertaste is very goat forward. Almost like eating a piece of chevre cheese. A bit much for my taste, and also crashes with the coffee flavour. 

Rating: 3/10, mostly due to the aftertaste.

*Excerpt*:

Aziraphale cancels his sessions for the next week at least, citing burnout and the possibility that he may need to take more time, knowing he will not be able to adequately carry out his job to the high standard he holds himself to and refusing to give anything less to his clients. They’re wonderfully understanding, and no one asks for a refund of their deposit; he’s lucky, he’s far too *lucky* and undeserving of such trust.

*Trust*. Lord, Crowley had *trusted him,* and what had Aziraphale done with such a breathtaking gift? The opposite of what anyone good would do, what anyone good would even *think* of— cowardly spouting devastating fabrications regarding his feelings and throwing that trust to the dirt where he could grind his heel onto it to better ensure that Crowley would walk away from him, petrified it wouldn’t work.

Deplorable, repugnant, and unforgivable— that’s what Aziraphale is, and maybe what he’s always been, he wearily supposes as he reminds himself to hydrate, as he tries to eat and attempts to sleep while doing all he can not to think of Crowley, all the while predictably failing in that particular pursuit.

He’s *all* he can think about.

Self loathing, agony, despair and missing him so *badly* he’d even go so far as to call it *withdrawal* all violently settle themselves into Aziraphale in regards to Crowley, but there are other emotions present, too— that first unbidden, hopeful leap of his heart wanting to dive into whatever Crowley next wanted with ill advised abandon, and pride. He cannot help the fierce pride blooming within him from Crowley stating what he wanted, and asking for more. He’d allowed himself to be courageous and brave and authentic, he’d taken a step that Aziraphale *never* could, and it was beautiful, it was honest and true and remarkable, but then again, Crowley is all of that and so much more.

There is also the *love* for him that will not budge, persevering and solid, warm and tenacious. It’s no good, trying to shove Crowley out of his heart like he’d shoved him out of his life; he’s *lingering*, the gold of him has made itself a home in Aziraphale’s blood, he thinks, so much so that he’d be curious to know if he’d bleed gilded vermillion if cut.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

**It's Day One of Retirement: What Do I Do Now?**

Retirement is a major life transition that many look forward to, but when the day finally arrives, it can feel surreal. After years of routines, deadlines, and responsibilities, suddenly having time to yourself can be both exciting and overwhelming. So, what do you do on **Day One of Retirement**? Whether you're seeking relaxation, exploration, or a balance of both, this guide offers tips to help you start your retirement on the right foot.

# Reflect and Celebrate

# Acknowledge the Milestone

The first thing you should do is give yourself a moment to acknowledge what you’ve achieved. Retirement marks the culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. Whether you throw a retirement party with friends and family or simply take a quiet moment to reflect, celebrate this milestone.

# Evaluate How You Feel

Transitioning into retirement isn’t just a financial or logistical shift—it’s emotional too. On Day One, take a deep breath and ask yourself how you're feeling. Excited? Nervous? A bit of both? Your emotional state is an important starting point for building a fulfilling retirement. If you feel anxious about this new phase, that’s perfectly normal. This is the beginning of a new journey, not just the end of a career.

# Create a New Morning Routine

Your first day of retirement is the perfect time to start establishing new daily habits. While the freedom from alarm clocks may feel liberating, creating a *light* routine can give you structure and purpose.

# Ideas for Your Morning Routine:

* **Morning exercise**: Whether it’s a gentle walk, yoga, or swimming, maintaining physical health is key in retirement.
* **Mindfulness practices**: Try meditation, journaling, or simply enjoying a quiet coffee while planning your day.
* **Personal goals**: Spend a few minutes identifying personal goals. These could range from hobbies to travel to learning something new.

# Explore Your Interests

The beauty of retirement is the newfound *freedom* to pursue your passions. What activities have you always wanted to try, but didn’t have the time for?

# Hobbies and Interests to Explore:

* **Creative outlets**: Painting, writing, photography, or pottery.
* **Learning opportunities**: Taking classes in history, language, or cooking.
* **Physical challenges**: Golf, cycling, hiking, or dancing.
* **Volunteering**: Helping others can be a rewarding way to spend your time.

Maybe today is the day to sign up for that painting class or start researching local volunteer opportunities. Day One is all about experimenting with new interests and rediscovering old ones.

# Organize Your Finances

Now that you're retired, managing your finances is crucial. Retirement income, whether from Social Security, a pension, or savings, may require careful budgeting to ensure it lasts as long as you do.

# Financial Steps to Consider:

* **Review your budget**: Make sure you're aware of your monthly income and expenses. Adjust as needed for your new lifestyle.
* **Meet with a financial planner**: If you haven’t already, consider meeting with a professional to review your investments and financial goals.
* **Health insurance planning**: Ensure your healthcare coverage is in place. If you're transitioning from employer-provided insurance to Medicare, confirm that all is set up correctly.

# Reconnect with Loved Ones

Retirement offers the opportunity to deepen your relationships. On Day One, consider reaching out to loved ones. Whether it’s scheduling regular family dinners, planning trips with friends, or just catching up on the phone, relationships can be a central part of your new chapter.

# Ideas to Strengthen Relationships:

* **Plan visits**: If you have family or friends living far away, consider scheduling a visit. Traveling during retirement offers the flexibility that working life often didn’t.
* **Reconnect locally**: Join local clubs, book groups, or sports teams to meet new people in your area.

# Take Time for Yourself

Finally, Day One of retirement should include some *you time*. This is your chance to relax, recharge, and do what you love at your own pace. Don’t feel pressured to plan every minute. You deserve a breather after decades of working.

# Self-Care Ideas for Day One:

* **Read a book**: Escape into a novel or tackle that pile of books you've been putting off.
* **Take a leisurely walk**: Explore nature or your local neighborhood without any agenda.
* **Spa day**: Pamper yourself with a massage or a relaxing bath.

# Plan for the Future, but Don't Rush

Retirement isn’t a sprint—it’s a marathon. You don’t need to have everything figured out on the first day. However, setting long-term goals can help provide direction.

# Future Plans to Consider:

* **Travel plans**: If you dream of traveling, start researching potential destinations and set aside dates.
* **Personal development**: Think about skills or hobbies you want to develop over the coming months and years.
* **Health and fitness goals**: Set achievable fitness goals to keep you healthy and active for many years to come.

# Wrapping Up: The Freedom of Choice

Retirement is a blank canvas, and Day One is the first brushstroke. While it can be tempting to jump into a busy schedule or new projects, remember that this is a time for you to **choose** how you want to spend your time. Whether it’s diving into a passion project or simply enjoying a slow, relaxing day, the beauty of retirement lies in having the freedom to decide.",2,1729603866.0,RetirementRoadmap,0,1.0,False

1g9i6ab,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g9i6ab,Review: Saiko Coffee Rozaana Blend,"I saw a post from a fellow redditor about their own coffee brand and decided to try it out as they're Delhi-based and I was on the lookout for local roasters. I ordered their Rozaana Blend. 

First Impressions:

The price display for Rozaana prior to clicking is 199. When you click on the item it shows Rs. 399 for 75 grams. Checkout brings another additional Rs. 50 delivery price, bringing the total to Rs. 450. I thought this was exorbitant for 75 grams but still gave it a go. 

The delivery took a long time, I ordered on the 4th, shipped on the 9th. I received it by the 10th. This might be because of order backlog as they had just started. 

  
Beans & brew:

The beans were medium roast, not on the darker side, just medium, which was a relief as that has been the case with a lot of Indian roasters. The packaging was solid, industry standard stuff. I liked the art and the personalized message. 

Made a latte. It tasted good, nutty and chocolaty with very slight bitterness. Did not have bold flavours, more balanced. Not bad for a morning beverage. I have yet to try in filter coffee form. 

  
Overall Review:

The beans were roasted just right, the packaging was good. The blend that I tried was well balanced in terms of taste overall (for a milk beverage). However, there are similar or better options available for my preference in beverages (Breakfast lattes and afternoon/evening filter coffee) at a much more affordable price point. 75 grams for 450 bucks is what puts me off. It may be the case that this was the price for sampler packs, but it still becomes a defining factor for me in terms of picking coffee. Additionally, as someone based in Delhi, I don't mind the 50 Rs. delivery charge but I would have preferred the option of picking it up myself or getting it Dunzo'd to avoid the wait time. Overall, not a bad experience for me, and as much as I'd prefer supporting local roasters, the price point does not do it for me.

So, I’ve always been kinda obsessed with maths and AI for as long as I can remember. Like, most of my teenage years and early 20s were just me geeking out over it. Eventually ended up leading AI research at one of the top uni in Europe (crazy right?). And over the last decade, I’ve watched the AI space completely blow up—from training basic neural networks to this whole new world of genAI.

Seeing all these advancements created this itch in me that I couldn’t shake off—like, I *had* to build something. It’s been on my mind for a while, but I couldn’t just sit and watch anymore. It was time to take action.

But then the real question hit me: *what the heck do I build?* And even more importantly, *who am I building it for?* That’s when I stumbled across some solid advice: “If you're building a product, make sure it’s for someone who can actually pay for it.” So that got me thinking... busy people like indiehackers, founders, investors, managers, etc.

After some research (and plenty of coffee), I built FastTrackr AI, a virtual assistant designed to save people like us a few hours every day. Launched it 2 weeks ago and already have some paying users! Honestly, that feels surreal.  
  
**What does FastTrackr AI do?**   
It takes care of the annoying stuff like:

* Writing and replying to emails
* Setting up meetings
* Turning your messy voice notes into proper, structured ones
* Even doing some research for you

All through WhatsApp.

Basically, it’s here to handle the boring tasks so you can focus on what really matters.

I honestly cannot thank this community enough. It’s the posts and stories shared here that pushed me to keep going and take the plunge. I’d love to hear any feedback or advice you have—especially on what worked for you in gaining those first 1000 customers! Let’s keep building and supporting each other!

by c.w. cobblestone

&#x200B;

I wasn’t in much of a holiday mood when I awoke in the woodshed Thanksgiving morning. My entire body ached from two days of digging, and sleeping on hard logs hadn’t helped. I couldn’t feel my toes and feared they were frostbitten, although after I roused myself and stomped around the shed for a few minutes, the feeling returned to my lower extremities.  

It was still dark and all was quiet. I ventured out of the woodshed and peeked at the cabin; no lights were on. With a lonesome sigh, I scooped up a handful of snow and ate it before tiptoeing toward the woods, treading lightly so the crunch of footsteps on snow wouldn’t wake anyone. When I was a safe distance away, I took my morning leak, and then used more virgin snow to wash up and brush my teeth.

Then, it was back to the woodshed to wait. And think. And worry. And hate myself. 

I sat on a log near the shed door, which I left open a crack so I could see the cabin. It was too dark to read the book I’d brought, and I didn’t want to fiddle with my cellphone because the battery was low, so I closed my eyes and thought of Elena. I smiled when I recalled how pretty she’d looked the previous day in her white coat and the cute, furry hat she always wore in cold weather. I felt a twinge of sadness when I realized I’d only gotten a chance to see her for a few seconds, and she hadn’t said a word to me. 

Like a lovesick teenager, I groaned out loud and gazed longingly at the cabin, aching from the knowledge that my precious wife was sleeping just a few yards away. I wondered which pajamas she had on while curled up in bed — and as soon as that picture tickled my imagination, my mind’s eye immediately saw her pig of a boyfriend snuggled up next to her. I felt like the world’s most pathetic sap, freezing my ass off in the woodshed while my wife and her lover were nice and warm together beneath a fluffy comforter. 

The hours crept by. I kept eating snow to try to quell my gnawing hunger. It got so bad I ventured into the woods to seek nourishment, but was unable to find anything, even a few berries. I ended up breaking off pieces of a pine comb and chewing them. It made my mouth gummy but my stomach remained empty.

Finally, lights started flickering on inside the cabin. It was probably 20 minutes before the backdoor swung open, and Tom walked outside yawning and scratching his balls. After sucking in a few breaths full of morning air, he shouted, “Hey, Fat-Ass — Linda wants you!”

I stumbled out of the woodshed and hurried toward the cabin, where a smirking Tom held the door open.

“Did you get a good night’s sleep out in the shed?” he asked in a snarky tone as I approached him.

I knew it wouldn’t be wise to complain, so I replied, “Um, it was okay, sir. I used my gym bag as a pillow, so it wasn’t so bad.”

He scoffed and headed back inside with me at his heels. I’d spent so much time alone pining for company, I was overwhelmed with awkwardness as I slogged into the spacious cabin, where everyone was up and at ‘em. Elena and Kurt chilled on the couch, clad in robes and sipping coffee, while Rachel and Taylor sat at the dining room table engrossed in their smartphones. Linda was in the kitchen rummaging through the refrigerator. Nobody looked up when Tom and I walked in.

“Go see what Linda wants,” my father-in-law ordered, and I headed toward the kitchen.

As I passed the dining room table, Taylor saw me and pointed to her half-empty glass of orange juice. “Hey, Lard-Ass, how about a refill?”

“Yes, Miss,” I muttered, scooping up the 20-year-old’s glass and rushing toward the kitchen.

“There you are,” Linda said when I entered the room. “I’ll be working on dinner, but go see what everyone wants for breakfast first. You can cook that.”

“Um, yes, Ma’am. Is it okay if I refill Miss Taylor’s orange juice first?”

Linda nodded and I hopped into action. After setting Taylor’s glass in front of her, I figured I’d do some brown-nosing in case Elena was paying attention from the living room, so I asked, “Will there be anything else, Miss?”

Rachel giggled. “I still can’t believe he has to call us ‘miss.’”

“It’s about basic respect — or lack thereof,” Kurt called from his spot on the couch as he pulled my wife closer into his embrace. “As far as I’m concerned, he PUT himself in a position where he doesn’t deserve any respect, so I think it’s appropriate that he show others the utmost respect. What do you think, Rog? Do you deserve any respect?”

I bowed my head. “No, sir.”

“Stand up straight!” Kurt barked. “Look everyone in the eye and tell them you don’t deserve any respect.”

My soul left my body as I complied with the order. Seeing the disgust on Elena’s face was pure torture. 

Desperate to change the subject, I croaked, “um, Miss Linda told me to see what everyone wants for breakfast.”

Taylor’s nose crinkled. “Eww, are you cooking it?”

“Y-yes, Miss.”

“Then, make sure you wash first.”

“Um, yes, Miss.”

When the guffaws died down, I took everyone’s orders. Kurt wanted bacon and eggs. My wife ordered an omelet, and her sisters each wanted sausage and hashbrowns. I hurried to the kitchen to start cooking, while Linda stood nearby preparing the holiday meal.

My poor, empty stomach was groaning the blues around all that food, and after slaving over the stove for several minutes, I finally worked up the courage to ask my mother-in-law, “Um, is it okay if I make something for myself? I haven’t had anything to eat in two days.”

Linda scoffed. “It doesn’t look like you’re exactly starving, Roger. Yeah, go ahead — one egg, and some cottage cheese. You don’t need any more than that.”

“T-thank you, Ma’am,” I replied, wondering to be happy or sad. One goddamn egg and some cottage cheese. It was something.

After cooking and serving breakfast, I wolfed down my meager meal in the kitchen. When I was finished, I ventured back to the dining room, and into a scene straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting: The happy family at the holiday table. I stood there feeling totally left out.

Then, I was literally left out, when my wife snarled at me and said, “I don’t want to look at you all day. Mom wants you to clean up after dinner, but until then, go back in the shed. If anyone needs anything, we’ll call.”

Biting my quivering lip, I peeped, “Y-yes, Ma’am.”

Taylor shook her head. “Man, I never thought anyone could be so pathetic.”

Kurt snorted. “Roger wrote the book on pathetic, didn’t you, Rog?” 

“Y-yes, sir.”

My wife’s lover nodded regally. “Now, get your fat ass out in the shed like Elena told you.”

Rachel tittered. “That’s just not fair — it looks cold out there.”

As I trudged out the door, I heard Taylor laugh and say, “Nah, Lard-Ass has all that whale blubber to keep him warm. He’ll be fine.”",3,1729603291.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1g9hy8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/1g9hy8o/productivity_theater/,Productivity Theater?,"Thoughts?

Me: My wife always is asking me to get a daily routine. I work from home as a software developer and I often work on the couch with the dogs and have a hard time getting started in the mornings and find it hard to fit in exercise and other forms of self-care. I think part of ADHD comes with a certain amount of conserving willpower and energy to meet the essentials and sometimes that just comes down as like “i am a lump on the couch” and don’t do extra because just getting it together to do my job and perform essential tasks is all I can withdraw from the much smaller bucket of executive function I get daily.

Would I really be served by being go go go and adding that rigid structure to my days? It feels more draining than energy-giving.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Claude 3.5 Sonnet:

This really highlights the disconnect between neurotypical and neurodivergent approaches to energy management. For your wife, structure might feel like it creates energy, but for an ADHD brain, rigid structure can be incredibly depleting.

Your couch work setup might actually be adaptive because:
- It reduces the executive function cost of getting started
- It provides comfortable sensory input (dogs, soft surface)
- It eliminates the friction of a formal workspace
- It conserves energy for essential tasks
- It allows you to meet work obligations effectively

The ""spoon theory"" applies here - you're right that you're working with a smaller daily allowance of executive function, and you're being strategic about how you spend it:
- Getting work done > having a perfect morning routine
- Meeting obligations > following an arbitrary schedule
- Conserving energy > performing ""productivity theater""
- Adapting to your needs > following conventional advice

However, maybe there's a middle ground that could help both of you:
- Creating predictable anchors without rigid schedules
- Finding routines that energize rather than drain
- Building structure around your natural patterns
- Adding one small consistent habit at a time
- Making self-care easier, not harder

For example:
- If the couch works for work, could you add one morning anchor (like coffee with dogs) before it?
- Could exercise be more informal (walking dogs) rather than structured gym time?
- Could self-care be integrated into existing patterns rather than added as extra tasks?

The goal would be to find stability that works with your brain, not against it. Structure shouldn't cost more energy than it gives back.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",4,1729603173.0,ADHD_Programmers,3,1.0,False

Ensuring your profile is complete and up-to-date increases the chances of appearing in local search results when someone nearby searches for your services or products.

# 2. Target Local Keywords

Use **local keywords** relevant to your business. For example, if you run a bakery in Mumbai, include terms like “best bakery in Mumbai” or “fresh cakes near me” in your website content, blog posts, and meta descriptions. These keywords help search engines understand your business’s location and connect you with customers searching for nearby products or services.

# 3. Encourage Customer Reviews

Customer reviews are a significant factor in local SEO rankings. Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on Google or other local platforms. **Responding to positive and negative reviews** demonstrates customer care and builds trust. More reviews and higher ratings improve your chances of ranking higher in local searches, making it easier for nearby customers to find and visit your store.

# 4. Use Local Listings and Directories

Apart from Google, list your business on other popular **local directories** like Justdial, Sulekha, or even Zomato and Swiggy for food-related businesses. Consistency across all listings (name, address, and phone number) is important for search engine accuracy. The more visible your business is across these platforms, the more likely customers in your area will discover you.

# 5. Mobile-Friendly Website

In India, most users search for local businesses on their mobile devices. Having a **mobile-friendly website** is essential for providing a smooth user experience. A website that loads quickly and is easy to navigate ensures visitors can find the information they need without frustration, increasing the likelihood they’ll visit your store.

# 6. Optimize for Voice Search

With the rise of digital assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, **voice search** is becoming more common, especially for local queries. People using voice search often phrase queries differently, such as “Where’s the nearest coffee shop?” or “Best saree shop near me.” Tailoring your content to address these natural, conversational queries can make your business more discoverable through voice search.

# 7. Post Regular Updates

Use Google Business Profile’s feature that allows you to post updates. Whether it’s about a new product, special offer, or seasonal event, regularly updating your profile with fresh information keeps your audience engaged and encourages them to visit your store.

# Conclusion

Local SEO is an essential strategy for brick-and-mortar businesses in India looking to increase their visibility and drive more foot traffic from nearby customers. By focusing on Google Business Profile, optimizing for local keywords, encouraging reviews, and ensuring your website is mobile-friendly, you can en							hance your store’s presence and connect with the right audience—right around the corner!

I can only save the people that have a history that I know.

It dawned on me.  They have made up a ton of bullshit.

I don't think I will need to go to all the countries, just the ones the vikings didn't ruin.  I don't know your history.

I have to know your past.

The part the vikings fucked up on that is....

The truth will set you free...

That is what the bible is composed of.

Some stuff God, some stuff Jesus.  God all the same.  Satan too.  Jesus is a black man that is a nurturer.  Think about a soft-hearted persons worst fear, anger, guilt and resentment.  That is where we live, and his biggest dreams.

Which then I hear my kids getting angry about shit calling me a pussy.  They hate me like my wife.  Alpha, Omega.

You feel a connection with people.  Doesn't mean you should fuck them.  Fuck someone you love.  The connection is how much pressure you can handle.   Good magnet, be nice to one another and love each other.  But, A black man and a white women are both nurturers.  Which is fine, but you'll never get the God Brain.  It's neat.

The choices are wild.

If you want to be God, I'll send you on your path.  I won't keep a secret.  Be careful, the choices are hard.

We make the universe around us.

Check Facebook.  Edgar O'chit. I have a list of that the countries I have been too.  I have never been to anywhere but America in Canada.  Windsor and Niagra.

I still want to come back and visit the places I have been, but we will have to coordinate this properly.  I think I have 7 years.  I won't need it.

I am very efficient.

Love you all.  Have a blessed day.

AI Bots put that in the system a billion times.  Ya know darn well you have been trying to hide that.  Google my name.

Football coach in the Big Ten and Last guy to make a call in 9/11.  Darkness is always working to stop you.  If you tried to cheat, which I know you did.  You put my face in the women's mind.

If they were in a dark balanced place, they hated me.  I was the Antichrist.  Then the darkness starts covering me up more.

The more you just didn't say my name, the bigger the problem was.  Karma has a sense of humor.

You didn't learn that one ever.

VIKINGS - Secrets are a competitive Mindset.  you are all different versions of the same viking story.  They were just first and have maintained control of Karma this whole time.  The white ones.

The lessons get harder and harder, or if you never ever get the lesson Jesus (God/Devil of the 4th hardest universe) gave you, they might get easier.  The white man (Alpha) (Jacob) could never accept a black man (Omega) (esau)

We got light skin tones, but then the Vikings started herding them.  So then, he mixed up the cards.

Karma.  Tried to make it easier, you still didn't see.  One speed, kill the men, Rape the Women, Cage the animals.   and fuck your kids.   Man.  Let's get the hell out of here.  lol

Yin-Yang works with everything.  Men, women, colors, politics, all of it...

First, they made black people out to be pussies for having feeling.  Then they bread them to not have the strong intuition, because all the white guy has is a brain.  The Alpha is the mind.  White man could never get over it.  Black men are more gifted with intuition (Creator).  White Men have the Biological Brain (Composer).

I think I know how to put this shit back together for the ones that want to stick around in my heaven and hell.  We'll see.

I got you.  We can go.  I don't have any money, currently.

And for some reason Verizon, which is certainly owned by the vikings, has my location on, but I don't have service.  They overcharged me quite a bit of money when I was having my money deplete by the machine. Then laughed at me on the phone.  And I am willing to bet, passed the video aound to the Vikings in the know.

It's probably 20% globally.  We aren't all white anymore.  It gets confusing.

I think the Jesus, Satan in this case, believers, think Alpha was a White man and a black Woman was the Omega...well, sort of...lol.

Whoever thinks raping men or children is part of the way out.  Please use your head.  That was Jesus' dark desire.  It is a temptation.  It's in the shadow, be careful.

You get too dark in the darkness; rape happens everywhere in your life.  It is just emotionas.  This shit ain't real.

I just learned to break more energy tanks to save the world.  Good luck with my hell if you stay, wow.

Limbo is in the middle.  Supposed to be 99 years and out.

Balance.

After a run through this shit you get a test score.  You must past all your lessons, if you want to be God, or go home.  Or wait for someone else to do it.  We have been at this for 46,000 years.  The vikings never learned.  Good luck with that.

I passed 8.  You will have to pass ten to get out with my sons.

And 14 if you stay in my boys.  None of this is real.  Let's go.

Verizon, so it's off.  But the service is on.  5G.  weird.

We are all going to Heaven.  Just give me a minute to meet everyone.  I can't wait to meet the folks in Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria, Australia (Homebase of the Vikings) Sorry for all the suffering.  We didn't mean it.  We thought only one group got to go.  So much fun ahead.

Oh, funny one.  The offer is up to 83 women.  It is one of the lessons.  I got offered 83 different versions of my omega.  Um.  Temptation anyone?  I love God.  my Omega.

Oh, I know a very religious lovely Jesus Believer in Hell.  I love her.  She is awesome.  I mean no harm.  She told me there is no sex in heaven.

Well, God has the universe split.  Like I say.  Alpha and Omega.  Men, Women, black and white.  Madea is the protector; Joe is the Nurturer.  Ruthless Viking Male is the protector, Abused Raped viking woman is the nurturer.  See the lesson.  Love each other, who cares.  Two parts must work together. (Now Brothers - Good one grandpa)

Anyways.  Ya know how black men are ultra-aggressive. They are supposed to be nurturing.  Which in the viking world is faggot so we get all caught up in Jesus' dark desires.... Please stop it.  All.

Black men and White women are creators.  White men and black women are Composers.

I know in Thailand the woman is the composer...lol.  So do they...

**AFTER 3 WEEKS = MORE ENERGY - LESS PAIN**

I stopped working outside home \~5/yrs ago. Back then, if I spent one hour shopping, I needed an hour nap. *Stress went way down* and selfcare went up. Yesterday, I ran 7 errands (one grocery shopping) with no nap needed.

I test my pain levels by pressing my thumbs into my ribs below the armpit. Went from pain level 6 to 1/none.

**Water:** Before, I mostly drank diet caffeine-free sodas, Gatorade type drinks, and decaf coffee. For this trial I've had \~4 glasses of water/day (cut down on other stuff) and I am actually starting to like it small amounts.

**Fresh fruits and vegetables** = better digestive processes. An apple a day (Honeycrisp), banana and tangerine have me craving more. I've eaten uncooked carrots, and I enjoy them best with the apple. So overall 3-4 servings and I do enjoy it.

**Sleep**: Listened to sleep hypnosis every night. I feel more rested. Last night, with 5mg of Melatonin (I use \~1/month) I slept straight through 10:00pm to \~5:00am. That was **HUGE** for me.

**Self-Massage:** [How to Relieve TMJ Pain at Home | 30 SECOND RELIEF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppk7KmhGm-E) Neck feels much better. Did this \~once/day.

**Exercise**: Currently, I'm doing a bit less walking but more stretches and calisthenics. It's been better on my knees.

**Heat:** 2 warm/hot baths (it'd be amazing to do this every day). Using a heating pad wherever there was extra pain (as needed).

**Non-Dairy**: Soooo much less GAS.

**Flour and Sugar**: I've cut way back, but sugar amounts are climbing (fricking Halloween candy). I have had 12 grain bread and enjoyed that (\~2 slices/week).

**Fried**: Maybe ate more - traveled by car for 4 days.

I'm not strictly enforcing this lifestyle-forgiving myself if I slip but get right back into it. **Highly recommend** giving this challenging lifestyle a try. Your effort doesn't have to be perfect but shoot for doing a bit better every day.

Let me know what measures you use daily to help getting to remission.

Please care.","There is no point to this. About two years ago I was drinking an energy drink more days than not because of the nature of my work in corrections. I changed to a remote job, decided that I needed to change my habits and I cut out energy drinks. Then I realized my coffee habits were a bit out of control too, drinking one large mug of coffee (probably 3 cups worth) when I woke up, the same large mug in the afternoon, and sometimes a small cup in the evening. I woke up and drank it even if I didn’t need it. It just became a habit. 

Then on a trip to Japan, the friends that I went with would wake up at 5am with me due to the jet lag, and it automatically turned into this mission to find coffee. That’s when I realized how silly this caffeine addiction became. I didn’t want or need coffee because of the 13 hour time difference. I also didn’t want to waste my time hunting for coffee, I wanted to enjoy being there. So I branched off and did my own thing some mornings. I didn’t drink coffee the entire 11 days we were there.

It’s now been 14 months. I feel so much better without coffee. Before my energy levels were all over the place, lots of random crashes throughout the day, I wasn’t able to stay awake for a movie at night without some kind of caffeine. Before baby, my energy levels became perfect and felt natural. Woke up energized and just slowly eased down throughout the day, and if I wanted to stay up at night, it wasn’t an issue. I was sleeping 6-7 hours per night before baby and felt incredible.

Since baby, there have been a couple hard days, but generally I have been feeling amazing without coffee. I don’t have this big drop of energy and feeling exhausted that I hear other people complain about.

Ok. I’ve recovered. Here are the details 😅

BACKGROUND: My partner owns a grade 2 Listed Georgian 2bed 1 bath flat in Bristol. Conservation area. I’ve done so much reading and it’s a headache. They want to sell but I think they should hold. I’m an American and have been staying in the flat the past couple of months after some difficulties. I’m essentially out of work and want to help them any way I can. They were renting it but technically aren’t legally allowed to due to the issues with it. I have some DIY experience- mainly painting and doing crap like coffee tables from pallets. I just want to make it aesthetically pleasing rn. My partner has shared accommodation in London and is away. What can I do with a very limited budget and short time to spruce the place up a bit? Appreciate any tips/ advice in advance.

WHAT NEEDS FIXING: There are 5 flats in the building. There is a part of the roof that needs repair, the property management company has not got back in about a year which is when the roof has had issues. Owned it since 2020. There is a fund for the building for repairs (a pot I suppose), but again no one responds. So we’re told it is all our responsibility to repair this roof as the damaged part is over our flat (it is a flat as opposed to slanted roof and water has puddled). Conservation officer rejected plans a year ago that would’ve helped with the boiler etc which would decrease damp and allow for runoff.

I generally want to clean, paint, remove some mold, and dehumidify. There’s a recycling paint scheme near us. Found 2 large cans of paint and some tools.

1. ROOF: biggest issue and concern as you can see from pics in spare room but I can’t do anything physical about that rn. I’ll continue my research as I see the firm hired to submit planning documents did jack sh\*t. Partner didn’t have money to do it then and with me here and renter gone certainly can’t do it rn. #sadlife
2. Windows: 2nd biggest issue. Also won’t repair rn as quoted about 6k each. There is rot and condensation on the inside. There’s also what I think y’all call “damp”. There’s a draft and honestly they’re not safe. Rly big curtains that were here when bought to help keep the place warm.
3. Kitchen Sink: I wanna tackle the countertop. I’m thinking applying a sealant so that the wood doesn’t get damaged. There is a leak at times - mainly when my partner washes the dishes 🥴 and it doesn’t happen when I do. It’s not bad but obviously could lead to something bigger.  I also wanna replace the FAUCET so that it’s easier to open the tap as well as allow us to also use hot water. As it is it’s hard to open and mainly gives cold. TIPS?

4. Apartment door has no handle. We have to use the key to lock it from the inside and out and leverage it so we can get out hahah. I think this could be an easy-ish fix.

5. Bathroom: MAIN THING atm. UK showers really confuse me. Even some of the nicest ones lol. Anyways there’s no window in the bathroom . Research shows spare room didn’t have one either. Planning permission was granted in 07 but seems former owners only did the one. Veneer white tiles, some mold and it gets quite steamy. I want to spruce up floor, paint, add a sink stopper. What else can be done?

6. Main bedroom: think I just want to paint and add some shelves. There is some damp around window I think. Suggestions?",2,1729602197.0,DIYUK,2,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1g9hjj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1g9hjj4/20_lbs_and_counting_lost_as_a_formerly/,20 lbs. (and counting) lost as a formerly emotional/bored eater who works with human behavior,"First and foremost, I need to preface this by saying that this is purely based off my personal experience and what I’ve learned in school and professionally. I’m a behavior analyst; it would be unethical of me to provide clinical recommendations to someone I’ve never met. Obviously, consult with your doctor about your own weight/weight loss.

I (27, f) have always struggled with weight. Like a lot of 90s/00s kids, I grew up surrounded by fad diet books and parents who thought they were helping but inadvertently making matters harder. After I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism in high school, I began telling myself that my body would always be bigger, so there really wasn’t a point in even trying to lose weight. I 100% became an emotional/bored eater early on and kept it that way until recently. 

I’ve lost 22 pounds in 2 months; I’m still far from my goal but this is the first time I’ve successfully lost weight and the longest I’ve gone maintaining these lifestyle changes. 

One of the first things I learned in school is that you can’t just effectively stop or get rid of a certain behavior; there needs to be an alternative behavior to take its place that essentially “scratches the same (or similar) itch”. For example, someone who loves the taste of coffee but hates the caffeinated jitters could just stop drinking coffee altogether, but if they switched to decaf, it would solve their problem entirely without making much of a sacrifice. 

Using this concept with ourselves requires a good amount of introspection and a huge caveat of that “scratching the same itch” principle is that it really only works if you know for sure that it’s the same itch (are you just eating out of boredom or is there an underlying emotional issue?), and the effort required to engage in the alternative behavior should be less than or equal to the unhealthy behavior. So, if you know you’re emotionally eating due to stress, exercise would only really address half (or maybe even less of) the problem—even if you’re an athletic person, going to the gym usually requires a lot more effort than opening up a bag of chips. 

For my personal example, I saw snacking as a hobby more than anything else toward the end of my emotional eating period. I’d been in therapy for years, but I dove into my weight issues for the first time this summer. I set a “no eating after 7pm” rule for myself, and instead spent that time playing video games, working on something on photoshop, or reading in bed. I stay off social media as much as I can; Instagram feels antagonistic to my progress. I am doing this in addition to CICO with the Lose It app. I haven’t banned any specific snacks but I make sure I portion things out with a food scale or get pre-portioned snack-sized bags. So far, the weight has come off much quicker than I expected (although I don’t foresee that happening forever) and I don’t feel like I’ve been missing out on anything or turned all comfort zones in my life on their heads. 

I doubt I’m saying anything groundbreaking here and I don’t know if anyone will even read to this point, but I just wanted to share this because I was always the “bigger kid” who got to a point where I was ready to accept I was just always going to look and feel like this. I hadn’t looked at my weight on a scale in about 8 years because I was terrified of how I would respond. I know I’m only at the beginning of my journey, but I’ve experienced so many non-scale victories already and it feels so good knowing I’ve accomplished so much already, even if others don’t notice (yet).

Nice? - GME 10/22 Open Interest Price Movement Forecast and Options Analysis,"Welcome back to another edition of **Open Interest** - the only GME price movement forecast dedicated to an analysis of the options market!

[\\""BABY ARE YOU DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN? DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWN? DOWWWWWWWWWWNNN? OOooooooOOOOO!!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/s168oa2p0bwd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=28151b3dcdcebf7d92fcd1dcd5103ebf2310e8f6)

Even Jay Sean knows these IV levels are gettin' spicy. Why else would his lips be so delicious and pouty, like a popstar on the cover of a debut album attempting to look appealing and attractive to an audience for an industry that seeks to exploit a pandemic of societal loneliness by trapping the general public in a never-ending treadmill of s3xualized virtual pursuits? I mean, ""haha I love musiccccc.""

So let's take a look a what this yumberry crunch of an IV situation might mean for our intraday price action today and what we can expect in the week to come! Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday's price action was a general slump down toward that slightly negative gamma zone I pointed out in yesterday's post at $20.50. Options premiums in general were only slightly imbalanced toward the bearish side, but near-term premiums were biased more so e.g. about $1mil in bullish premium (25% of our total for the day) was concentrated on two orders for January and April 2025 that corresponded to fewer than 100,000 shares of intraday hedging. Unlike Friday's price action, there was no funny business to report here.

[10\/21 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/i3nggtv6sawd1.png?width=1215&format=png&auto=webp&s=cef6b14c44d18fcc1e7a93f013b7878ed8c6a505)

The one part of the day that was a bit exciting was around our brief midday recovery where on two occasions the IV dipped into the 69th percentile (nice). This puts October IV significantly below even our August lows and at close to 52-week lows with exception of a few intraday marks in January. 

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[10\/25 Weekly OI Changes 10\/21-10\/22](https://preview.redd.it/kj4chcq5tawd1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5edfeea0c00127b1bad7755b6f66e2c971f1e0a)

Sure enough if we take a look at our OI changes for this week's expiry we can see the strikes that told the tale of yesterday's movement. We've got a decent amount of new Put OI showing up at that post-September ATM trading range floor strike of $20.50 as well as a high volume of new OI immediately above our current price position of $21, $21.50, and $22. If we take a look at yesterday's call volume at these strikes, it was predominantly at the BID:

https://preview.redd.it/hfa8uoh5uawd1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef772eb6c68592b200148e359561e8f0fc868e25

The key strikes for Puts reveal a mix:

https://preview.redd.it/02fffmtmuawd1.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=a499e94a38d6ecb058800a9a040f1d3617a3a237

Notably total volume at the key Put strikes of $19, $19.5, and $20.50 were biased to transactions at the BID. This means that, predominantly, negative net gamma accumulation during yesterday's trading at these lower strikes is the result of market bullish activity on the stock forcing dealers to be long these Puts and thus hedge their positions with long stock. 

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/21-10\/22](https://preview.redd.it/3ztd1nz6vawd1.png?width=1865&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcbb91c47597e8220552153550880e09d0b80d2a)

A bit further down the road, we've got some meaningful Call OI accumulation at some key strikes - $21, $22, $25, $30 - which continues to spell out and anchor our weekly trading structure. The volume at these key strikes with large OI expansions was, intriguingly, shifted toward the ASK (\~65% Ask Volume).

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/tyq4yrxtvawd1.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e40399c9a72dfd667124c48caa998ed408337e

As we head into today's trading we espy some familiar figures. The $20.50 position is slightly more negatized and, based on premarket movements, could easily realize a bit more downside volatility over a short period of time today. If this happens, I would expect intraday options flow to start filling in Calls at this strike in preparation for another soft intraweek reversal into Friday's $21 Max Pain. 

$20 is so strongly gamma positive and volatility resistant, it will serve as a strong downside support that would require some uncommonly high bearish volume in order to be broken. There are obviously no impossibles in the market, but such a move would be highly improbably and isn't currently configured.

Our $21-$22 range still features a high concentration of positive gamma which can be exploited for a stable recovery intraweek and under the right conditions for positioning and volume can be ramped up into a mini gamma squeeze up to $22. These conditions have to be met and also require no spoiler shorting on the part of a wayward FundFriend.

**Technicals**

Our consolidation pattern continues as our oscillations get smaller. Our moving averages continue to tighten by pennies every day, MACD continues to flatten, and RSI is working its way back to our recent trend's inflection level at 40. This all points to some continued flatness, slight selling today as we bottom, then a soft recovery back up into the $21 range by the end of the week before a similar close to last week. Our intraweek movements are closing in on under $1. The pond can hardly get any stiller, so the principal question remains - do we get a CATalyst next Tuesday or do we continue to chill (essentially) into our December OPEX cycle? We can only wait and see.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/oob9esu9zawd1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd787f12a71d8af8636335a7743935e67f56d2d5)

As total volume stays low, as price oscillations get tighter, our IV necessarily will dip and options contracts will become cheaper and cheaper. Without some form of catalyst, they will likely stay low, though the lower they go, the less risk there is for institutions to load up on Long options in the expectations of a major price reversal to restore buying volume to the stock.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

We are probably looking at an inflection point today in our weekly trading trend. I am expecting some continued weakness (as we've essentially already seen premarket) today in the stock before a mild recovery picks up later in the week into the $21-$22 range which we saw last Friday. Without a catalyst, it is hard to anticipate any intraday price movement breaking out of our very tight trading paradigm for the meantime. With T-5 Days to National Cat(alyst?) Day, a girl can dream, however....

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",126,1729601685.0,Superstonk,12,0.93,False

Ok. I’ve recovered. Here are the details 😅

BACKGROUND: My partner owns a grade 2 Listed Georgian 2bed 1 bath flat in Bristol. Conservation area. I’ve done so much reading and it’s a headache. They want to sell but I think they should hold. I’m an American and have been staying in the flat the past couple of months after some difficulties. I’m essentially out of work and want to help them any way I can. They were renting it but technically aren’t legally allowed to due to the issues with it. I have some DIY experience- mainly painting and doing crap like coffee tables from pallets. I just want to make it aesthetically pleasing rn. My partner has shared accommodation in London and is away. What can I do with a very limited budget and short time to spruce the place up a bit? Appreciate any tips/ advice in advance.

WHAT NEEDS FIXING: There are 5 flats in the building. There is a part of the roof that needs repair, the property management company has not got back in about a year which is when the roof has had issues. Owned it since 2020. There is a fund for the building for repairs (a pot I suppose), but again no one responds. So we’re told it is all our responsibility to repair this roof as the damaged part is over our flat (it is a flat as opposed to slanted roof and water has puddled). Conservation officer rejected plans a year ago that would’ve helped with the boiler etc which would decrease damp and allow for runoff.

I generally want to clean, paint, remove some mold, and dehumidify. There’s a recycling paint scheme near us. Found 2 large cans of paint and some tools.

1. ROOF: biggest issue and concern as you can see from pics in spare room but I can’t do anything physical about that rn. I’ll continue my research as I see the firm hired to submit planning documents did jack sh\*t. Partner didn’t have money to do it then and with me here and renter gone certainly can’t do it rn. #sadlife
2. Windows: 2nd biggest issue. Also won’t repair rn as quoted about 6k each. There is rot and condensation on the inside. There’s also what I think y’all call “damp”. There’s a draft and honestly they’re not safe. Rly big curtains that were here when bought to help keep the place warm.
3. Kitchen Sink: I wanna tackle the countertop. I’m thinking applying a sealant so that the wood doesn’t get damaged. There is a leak at times - mainly when my partner washes the dishes 🥴 and it doesn’t happen when I do. It’s not bad but obviously could lead to something bigger.  I also wanna replace the FAUCET so that it’s easier to open the tap as well as allow us to also use hot water. As it is it’s hard to open and mainly gives cold. TIPS?
4. Apartment door has no handle. We have to use the key to lock it from the inside and out and leverage it so we can get out hahah. I think this could be an easy-ish fix.
5. Bathroom: MAIN THING atm. UK showers really confuse me. Even some of the nicest ones lol. Anyways there’s no window in the bathroom . Research shows spare room didn’t have one either. Planning permission was granted in 07 but seems former owners only did the one. Veneer white tiles, some mold and it gets quite steamy. I want to spruce up floor, paint, add a sink stopper. What else can be done?

6. Main bedroom: think I just want to paint and add some shelves. There is some damp around window I think. Otherwise it’s okay. Suggestions?",1,1729601635.0,u_Apprehensive_Flow99,1,1.0,False

My wife and I have for the past 8 years own 2 fast casual restaurants (think onigiri /bubble tea/ speciality coffee) who has done pretty decent by most people's standard. I also happen to have graduated from a T15 MBA program early this year focusing on entrepreurship and marketing that was quite valuable to our stores now.

Beyond daily restaurant responsibilities, I really want to focus my podcast on managing with a heart and empathy, which from a lot of my older workers have PTSD in this field because of the nature of this business.

Things I want to elaborate are the difference management style from our parents who are more traditional (work all day, limit workers, a focus on cost reduction, no delegating on projects) than our modern approach. (Long-term brand strategy, social impact, focus on work culture)

How would you go about this and is this worth trying?

They’re modern, well-educated, and have often described their relationship as an “arranged cum love marriage.” They’ve known each other since childhood and love to share their story. Even now, I can hear them laughing together, making it difficult to process that I found Bumble on my dad’s phone this morning.

My dad was driving me to college as he does sometimes if he has a early meeting, and asked me to read a LinkedIn message and type his response. While scrolling through his apps to look for LinkedIn, I noticed the familiar yellow Bumble icon. When I closed LinkedIn, I saw it again. I hesitated but eventually asked, “What’s Bumble?” He mumbled that it was nothing and “just there,” which didn’t make sense. I didn’t push further, as I felt it wasn’t my place. After some more muttering he quickly changed the subject, by asking me to read out a hoarding of a building, which was odd again, but I went with it.

After returning home from college everything seemed normal and my dad and I were talking as usual until my mom came back from work. Again as usual we had our coffee together and my parents were cracking jokes and laughing together when It hit me that my dad is sitting there possibly lying to her.

I searched “Bumble on dad’s phone” on Reddit because I genuinely don’t know what to do and found similar posts, but my situation has differences:

	1.	My dad has an iPhone and is tech-savvy; he wouldn’t have downloaded the app accidentally. Apple requires Face ID or a password to download apps so it definitely didn’t come pre-downloaded.
	2.	The app was on the home screen where new apps appear, suggesting it was downloaded recently which is relevant because- 
	3.	My dad has been struggling with work and looking for a new job, which is openly discussed in our household. Hence the linkedin message today morning- Bumble has a networking aspect too (if im not wrong) —could that be his reason?

I’m torn about what to do. Should I ask my dad or tell my mom? She deserves to know, but I’m unsure how she’d react. Should I just forget about it?",65,1729601528.0,AskIndia,70,0.97,False
1g9hcei,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForgottenStoriesph/comments/1g9hcei/6_years_ago/,6 years ago… ,"Eight months ago in a coffee shop near the hospital, got a chance to have a random chitchat with a familiar face in the area. A girl who patiently waits for the off of one of our PGIs. I would often see her sit by the window of the coffee shop, trying to make herself busy or amuse herself as time would pass by, time ticking, until the guy she’s waiting would appear and evidently a smile would crack on her face, sparks fly upon seeing the guy coming towards her. I can see her love for this certain guy, sometimes she would wait longer hours if the PGI would need to extend his duty hours. Waiting time wouldn’t waive her. The scenario is the same exact thing transpiring on a weekly basis. 

But on that day, it was a different day. She was not waiting for the guy, she was there because of  a habit. Our chat was casual enough, it ended on her admission of their break up and she needs to be transferred somewhere because of work. She was just there, to savour her last taste of coffee while on her last days in Cebu. 

Then, four days ago. I happened to bump into her on the same coffee shop. She cracked a smile and said “Why do we only meet when I’m broken-hearted?”.

After a catching up, she left. But the sadness in her eyes is evident despite the jokes and laughs she managed to let out. I can see that she’s a strong woman, standing tall despite the heartaches she’s been through. It amuses me to find someone who’s clearly fragile enough to be shattered into pieces yet managed to keep the bits and pieces whole.

I hope one of this days, she’ll have someone who can make her eyes sparkle again. If we ever bump into each other again, I hope your heart is full of love and joy.",1,1729601413.0,ForgottenStoriesph,1,1.0,False

1g9h802,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1g9h802/what_is_happening_right_now/,What is happening right now? ,"At present, the processes that are actively occurring in space are phenomenal and at the same time deep and transformative. Outdated structures, frameworks, buildings, and supporting constructions are literally collapsing before your eyes. Your life will never be the same as it was yesterday… this time is intense in its depth, and therefore, interesting physical sensations, energies, and states can be observed, which may manifest as elation at one moment and, at another, as being swept away in an ocean of tears. October is a time for the activation of karmic debts, so you may gain insights, awareness, and understanding about the people around you. Memories of past lives may surface, along with clarity about situations and events in your present life. Many relationships will be resolved and come to an end!

It’s as if you don’t know what to expect, and when the next turn comes, you’ve already forgotten the previous twist… and “everything starts over again”… the feeling doesn’t even have time to leave you before you are spun into the next whirlwind!

You can start seeing the meaning behind everything that has happened, and there may be a sudden shift in your physical state, as if someone is flipping your energy switch back and forth. For those who are working on themselves and in personal growth, everything is happening much more intensely because you are aware of what’s happening, and at the same time, it is liberating since you no longer resist, you just surrender. For those who are doing nothing… this time is like a coffee press squeezing everything you tried to avoid seeing. Hence, arguments, challenges, unpleasant conversations, and uncomfortable situations arise as a call not to lie to yourself! And if you ignore it… sorry, but you will pay much more for that, although deep down you know it, yet your strong ego and stubborn mind continue to resist everything.

Everyone experiences this time differently, even though the energy, its intensity, and frequency are the same for all; the feelings and projections differ greatly. It’s like one dress, but for each woman, it will look and feel entirely different. I agree, it’s not easy… therefore, those who are in personal growth understand this time and, in a way, anticipated it. As a result, many are transitioning from the mental body to the heart level, where everything is much clearer and comparatively easier to understand. Here, there is peace, even if tears fall. The coming months will continue this process, and already now, the topic of shadow sides is being brought to the forefront. The desire to be good, correct, orderly, meeting everyone’s expectations, and ultimately to be perfect destroys personality because it means the person denies their own shadows. Shadows are not just negative emotions, expressions, or thoughts… shadows are those parts of yourself that you are terrified to see, acknowledge, and confront. Shadows are all your facets; the shadows are also you!

And when a person ignores and suppresses their improper and indecent feelings—anger, fear, arrogance, contempt, shame, envy, and other “friends”—it creates an incredible tension in you, which affects your body, your sense of self, and, undeniably, your health. At this moment, various physical body symptoms may arise as a result of your denial and lack of acceptance of yourself. To see your shadows, to feel them, and to legitimize them means allowing yourself to be and allowing the energy to finally flow. Self-acceptance is the resource for living, because as soon as you deny any part of yourself, you are lying to yourself… you are betraying yourself! And how long have you been doing that? To change the situation, you must do things differently, or at least begin to perceive what is happening in a new way, by changing your attitude. No one wants to harm you, but the only one doing it is you—hurting yourself!

The soul insists on following its path, and that’s why many may intensely feel “disgust,” some even a deep repulsion toward what they are doing daily. And that will be a sign… and at the same time, a strong call to start realizing yourself for real! Which, of course, brings up fear, doubt, disbelief, thoughts about what others will think and how it will look… etc. At the same time, ancestral patterns and deep-rooted structures related to money, security, and freedom will be brought to the surface. This combo will force you to look, to step forward, and at the same time, to not even know where you’re headed! In one word, it’s fun and will only get more fun moving forward…

You need to know one thing… move from your head to your heart!
Know that you ALWAYS know one step ahead, and even if you don’t, it’s still there!
Trust.
Believe!
Do not fight, because fighting means losing!

Your mantra:
IF THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME NOW, THEN FOR SOME REASON, IT IS THE BEST FOR ME!

For context I work as a virtual assistant through an agency and have had the same client for 3 years. My first plan was to stay until our lay-offs next March. Yes, I understand without context that might sound silly and impractical, but in all honesty it's out of loyalty to my TL with my client, who's the best and most humanizing superior I've ever had. This year though, there's been a lot of shifts in our workflow, and I think I made the mistake of overestimating my ability to adapt.

Personally I've been dealing with health (physical and mental) problems with myself and my family, as well as a breakup, the death of a family member and some friends. I realize now I was never in a proper headspace because I never allowed myself to rest emotionally.

Nung nandun ako sa lamay ng tita ko at kaibigan ko, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Nung kausap ko yung stepdad ko at tito ko after they had emergency surgery, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Nung naghiwalay kami ng girlfriend ko, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Add to this pa, my wallet was stolen about a week ago, and even while talking with police and barangay, pinagiisipan ko pa trabaho ko.

Now, at work for the past few months, I've been getting in trouble recently. Important emails slipping me by, performance going down, getting call outs, etc etc etc. At this point I wouldnt be surprised if I get suspended or something. It feels like the perfect performance of 3 years have been forgotten in the exhaustion of a quarter.

I think the gravity of all the internal exhaustion is crashing down. I've been feeling change-averse. Anything work related has been giving me feelings of anxiety and nervousness, and I begin to breathe hard, and I have to hold onto something to support myself. Nag-breakdown pa ako sa Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf when I was catching up with a friend and I told her what's happened the past few months. Sometimes, it takes effort to do anything, like eat or even things I used to look forward to doing. I've been told I lost a lot of weight na din. I feel perpetually cold inside, like I have ice in my lungs. There were a couple of points where I cried 5 times a week.

1g9h1xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1g9h1xf/birthdays_and_celebrations/,Birthdays and celebrations ,"My 25th birthday is a little over a week away. In my country, 25 is a pretty big age (i really don’t know why) and there’s a bunch of traditions (that people have started to say no to, since some of them are weird af). Thing is, I hate my birthday with a passion. Every year it comes around and I’m unprepared every year, cause I hate being celebrated. I miss being a child and all I had to do was wake up and perhaps my grandparents and one best friend would be there, but I wouldn’t have to make a decision.

I haven’t had a birthday party since preschool basically. I hate the thought of it, but I love celebrating others birthdays.

My perfect 25th birthday would be getting brunch at my parents’ house, maybe getting coffee with one person, maybe having a dinner with my family and then going home to unwind and play a little Skyrim.

My parents disagree. They started asking what I wanted, and as usual, I said that I didn’t know, cause I really don’t. All I know is that I don’t want a big party or to host anything. 

My parents then offered that I could invite all of my friends from different friend groups and have a party, which I honestly thought was a joke (since they know me and I can’t mix friend groups cause I’ll feel like I’m hosting people). I laughed and they looked at me weird because they were serious. 

I said no thanks, and they began defending the plan.

To try to meet them halfway I said I might invite some people out for drinks BUT I REALLY DONT WANT TO. My autism makes it so I can’t make decisions because it has to be the perfect one, so whenever I feel close to make a decision, my parents will offer another option, and I won’t be able to decide.

My parents keep trying to come up with good ideas, like that they were the ones who hosted so I wouldn’t be the host, but that doesn’t matter to me. If the party is about or for me, I’m the host. Doesn’t matter if they want to cater or anything, I’ll have the fear the host has. And the thing is, i wouldn’t have an issue saying “hey, i miss you guys, want to go out for a couple beers soon?” to my friends, but the fact that it’s going to be “about me” and that it’s a celebration of me is making me nauseous. I know I won’t be able to enjoy my birthday (i never do anyways) if I do arrange something for people, and i probably won’t be able to enjoy the days up to, since I’ll be anxious and worry about it. But like… is this a thing I should push myself to do? Like maybe it’s good for me to try to look my fear in the eye? How do I know whether or not something is something hard that I should push through and something I generally don’t want to do? 

I know my parents mean well, since they had huge 25 y/o birthday parties, and so did my best friend, so they are just confused of what I want to do. They keep saying “it’s totally okay if you just want to have a chill day with us, but we are so ready to throw a party for you”, which to me sounds like “i guess it’s okay if you want to sit at home like a loser, but we want to have a party”, which definitely isn’t what they mean (or is it???? idk) but now i feel shitty and anxious and i wake up nauseous every morning cause I don’t know what I want to do. I thought I did, but now I’m confused.

I’m kind of in a horrible mental state lately, and I have energy to do nothing and if it was any other birthday, I wouldn’t fret and just to something chill, but it’s my 25th birthday and that is a big deal FOR SOME REASON. 

My biggest fear is that I will regret not having a big party or see any friends, since your 25th birthday is so big, but it was never something I wanted to do, but what if I don’t know that it’s something I want?? What if I grow from it??

I put in a good word for her although I didn’t know her personally, I had friends that did and I knew professors really liked her so I was honest with my boss in that regard. I think this is my boss being racist, and it’s blatant discrimination. She started out with the salary I was making after a promotion, and now is making more than me. She barely does anything at work all day. I see her play games on her computer and half ass work. She was given much more responsibility and was trusted more than I was from the beginning. She leaves early any time she can get away with it, and no one says anything to her. She disappears and takes 2 hour lunches without any repercussions. She also has told me on multiple occasions she will show up half drunk, with alcohol in her coffee cup, and will take edibles during work hours or before work. She will sit there stoned out of her mind while I am expected to be twice as productive for less pay. For context, she’s white, and I am Asian. My boss denies there is any issue and says he is “monitoring” the situation although he will not take action. Legally, I don’t really have any proof nor the means for a discrimination case. I am beyond frusrated. It is not fair. She is untouchable and can do no wrong, her mistakes get brushed off and mine are issues that come up time again in my reviews despite putting in my best efforts to correct them, they are highlighted. I get reprimanded in front of the whole office, while she is actively not doing her job and could honestly get away with murder. She tries to be my friend but I can’t be her friend if she is taking advantage of her privledge in this way. She knows she has the upper hand. Any time I bring up the issue, she says that it’s because we’re both women so our boss is sexist. She makes herself the victim. It has nothing to do with us being women, more than half of the workplace is women, and 4 people in upper management positions are all women. So our boss clearly is not sexist in the same way he is racist. Other employees (who are not white) are over worked and under paid constantly.

1g9gz8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1g9gz8b/injury_at_work_due_to_defective_equipment/,Injury at work due to defective equipment.,"I have a job for a multinational coffee company, which I have held for 6 months, and last week we had remedial work done to fix a leaky tap at work.

This is evidenced on CCTV and also by our sign in book (contractor work) and they left before we signed to say we were happy with the work. 

Jump ahead to 2 days later and I'm trying to turn the tap off, and in doing so because it was broken I needed to use more than the usual force. It was at this moment that the tap failed and began to spin freely. I thus suddenly found myself pushing through the tap and smashing my wrist off the sink.

This caused localised bruising (I have photographic evidence) and has left me with reduced mobility in my wrist, which I am trying to get checked by a Dr but can't due to lack of appointments. 

We filled out an IRF but I couldn't use this to explain that had the tap been fixed properly it likely wouldn't have happened at all. 

Our District Manager signed off the work despite it not being fixed to a safe standard.

I suppose my question is, is there anyway to seek redress for this incident? 

Many thanks. ",0,1729600285.0,LegalAdviceUK,5,0.5,False

It seems to me that, not so long ago, blogging was huge. I subscribed a lot of blogs on Google Reader. I remember feeling a bit jeleous when I saw people’s bios like “Writer, photographer, designer and an avid reader”, or, “Thinker, coffee enthusiast and global nomad”. I hoped one day I could be that confident to proudly label something for myself. On the other hand, I felt some of the titles were somewhat pretentious. Thinker? Who doesn’t think? 🤔 Everyone at least thinks about what to eat for dinner on a daily basis, don’t they?

Seriously though, I know I couldn’t call myself a thinker because I lack the ability to articulate my ideas clearly or write coherently. What’s even sadder is, I’m not talking about English; I cannot write a decent article in my native language either. After watching a good movie or returning from a trip, if I could not write a good article to record how I feel, the memories will just fade away eventually. 

Wait a minute, why do I alwasy trun my writing into a negative vent. This is the last paragraph and it should be positive. So, I will jsut say: at least I’m working on it. Slow progress, but it’s something. The end. 😌💪🔥

I've really been stuck on this lately and need some help. I want to get moving on selling digital products but I'm really stuck on the offer and if I need a big promise.

Here's what I mean. I've pretty good with marketing related tech. My professional career has been in sales and marketing technology for a very long time.

Where I'm stuck is the offer or promise of my course or product. I see ads for two types of offers. Let's use selling a course as an example.

The first type type is selling the course:

* Chatgpt the complete guide to AI mastery
* Creating content with AI unlocked
* Chatgpt and content creation with Chatgpt for beginners

Then there's the second type of a big outcome:

* How Chatgpt landed me 90 clients in 90 minutes all with a simple one sentence prompt
* The Chatgpt prompt that generated $10,000 in course sales in 10 minutes while I drank my morning coffee in my pajamas 
* How to flip the hidden switch in Chatgpt to create 1,000 SEO articles that will rank in Google in one hour

Because of my career knowledge, I can create ""how to"" type of digital products on topics off the top of my head. Like how to create a funnel, how to use a specific software, etc, etc.

However, I don't feel I can make any of these big promises or claims for my digital products. 

Are these big claims just marketing hype?  
Do I need to make big claims to sell my digital products?  
Can I succeed just selling a course without a big claim?

I'm stuck going around in a circle on this and could use some advice.

As an example, how would you position a course on creating blog articles with Chatgpt?

So obviously we have two very different workflows, and it’s going to be hard for a cafe to ever compete with a home user at this point. Home hobbyists are now getting unprecedented access to quality grinders and machines, and have the time and interest to dial specific high quality beans perfectly - something not easily done at a cafe where speed and efficiency far outweigh extraction perfection.

I’ve been traveling quite a bit for work, and my main hobby on these trips has been finding cafes that can match home hobby coffee, and it’s surprisingly difficult. Obviously the goal of most these places is to get you a good to great product as quickly as possible to get through the queue of customers, so this isn’t really surprising.

My best successes have been looking for places that are primarily roasters. They have a vested interest in presenting their beans in the best possible light, and have often gotten close to my home setup.

How often do you guys, who are probably much more knowledgeable than me, find cafes that are making coffee better than yourselves? What do you look for, and how do you go about picking from dozens or even hundreds of options?

Hey Reddit fam, it's Derek, aka u/solopassions, checking in with an epic solo travel tale! 🎒✨

Picture this: Atlanta, Georgia - a bustling cityscape, but my eyes were set on an *enchanting treehouse*. Yes, you heard me right! Nestled high in the trees, this Airbnb oasis was calling my name, promising a one-of-a-kind solo escape.

First off, let's talk about that treehouse. It's the kind of place that combines luxury with the unforgettable charm of a Swiss Family Robinson dream. Plush bedding, high-end amenities, and the soothing symphony of rustling leaves – living in the treetops was pure bliss. 🌿

Now, solo travel isn’t all whimsical treetop dwellings. There were challenges, like fending off curious squirrels trying to taste-test breakfast (how do they know what vegan bacon is anyway?). 🤔 🌸 Being on my own? Honestly, it felt liberating to rely solely on *myself* for adventure plans and spontaneous detours.

Solo travel taught me to savor moments, like sipping coffee on a deck surrounded by nature’s serenity. No distractions, just *me and the forest birds*, contemplating life while dodging the aforementioned squirrels. 🐿️

My advice? If you're considering solo travel, *do it*. Break free from the pack and immerse yourself in destinations that challenge, inspire, and *wow* you. Choose bold and unexpected stays – maybe even a treehouse!

Lastly, sing yourself an unofficial anthem: ""I am a traveling treehouse hermit, hear me roar!"" Mighty things happen when you step outside your comfort zone. Adventure awaits solo travelers, one treetop at a time. 🌲🌟

So, pack light, bring a squirrel-proof snack, and embark on your solo quest. Book your treehouse escape now. You've earned it, fellow wanderer! 🚀🗺️

(Vol. 2),"*Please note that I’m not paying for all the gem scenes (I’m broke) and I’m only romancing male characters (might change it because of 🔥Lisbeth🔥)- feel free to add more info for all of us🥰 also, I think I will go for Jesse (what can I say, I love a painfully slow burn and I want to fight Sofia) but until I can be with him I’m going to be a hoe and choose chaos*😍

**Previously on Love Island - Winning Hearts:**

The episode begins with the revelation of the extremely unpredictable cliffhanger - MC and her favourite (Milo in my case) will go on a snorkelling date! The jealousy is spreading like a wildfire - Nyah, Ethan and even Sofia (because in her delusional eyes it’s her and Jesse who should have won.) MC isn’t having it and confronts our best friend but of course Sof-Sof isn’t ready to accept her foolishness. Will she ever be?

Ethan and Hayden confuse MC with Milo because she suddenly is the food tester of the group and has to test their coffee. Fusebox doesn’t miss a chance to make us do something cringey - we can either spit or moan. What happened with “I like it, I don’t”? (Also: I wasn’t strong enough to pour the coffee sExILy down the drain, I’m sorry 😔)
The two guys spill the coffee: LI and their partner are having issues and MC is the reason for it.

It’s date time with our LI and we see a dolphin - already my personal highlight of the season. Our LI confesses that he connects with both, MC and his current partner. Another confession: he had a naughty dream about the MC last night and sparks fly high, topping it off with an underwater kiss. LI shares a cute memory and my plan of being a hoe might get jeopardised. And why is the date cute and enjoyable? At the end of the date we had to make another major decision and I had to close the app because I wasn’t ready. After some time of gathering my thoughts and courage, I decided to stick with my LI (i am such a brave soldier)

MC stumbles right into an argument between Sofia and Jesse after the date and it’s of course our fault! Franki says Sofia is just emotional and somehow the girls feel bad for her and I am at loss of words here. It wouldn’t be fb, if the reason for Sofia’s childish outburst wasn’t hidden behind a paywall - Jesse told the boys that ever since MC came into the villa (approximately 3 hours after they entered the villa) he was seeing a different side of Sofia (her crazy mad mad delusional side). Sofia confronted him and they argued. But on the other hand, all the boys like MC, so yay go MC!

It’s grafting time!
MC joins Ethan’s poetry club, who would have thought that this boy is a poet and has a notepad where he writes everything down?
Milo tells MC that he has a connection with Nyah and MC and that his feelings for MC are only going to get stronger. We get the option to make some mocktails but I refused - we had boys who did that for free!
Hayden doesn’t miss the opportunity to rub it in Mc’s face that she is not his type - we get it buddy, no need to dig the knife deeper. (I wanted to go for Hayden but he’s making it so hard rn)
Long story short - every guy (Jesse not included) would be open to try new things (couple up with MC)

There isn’t going to be a recoupling, instead the public voted who should split up - Jesse and Sofia! And MC has also the chance to divorce a couple up. I decided for Lisbeth and Ethan, I couldn’t bear another drama with Sofia and a man I like (ups, I’m getting ahead of myself!)  Fusebox managed to surprise me and I was left speechless because I really thought I could choose between the singles and get with Jesse🤡 but no, MC stays single and they just swapped the couples💀
Sofia is unable to comprehend how Love Island works and it’s getting on my nerves, so of course I clapped back. All she had to say was that we were the stirrer. After a while she comes back and apologies to the MC but I didn’t accept it. Ethan (or whoever is coupled up with Sofia) decides to sleep outside which Sofia totally understands. She gushes over her new partner (babe we know what you’re doing). Jesse on the other hand is really shaken up by Sofia’s behaviour and talks to MC about it (FRIENDS TO LOVERS HERE WE GOOOO). Sofia sneaks out but we don’t find out what she and her partner did. The episode ends with announcing a challenge.

Stay tuned for the next volume and let’s see who will win MC’s heart💘

**I didn’t expect all the positive feedback on my last recap and I want to thank all of you for your kind words and encouragement, it made my day!💕 I’m planning on doing this weekly as long as it’s something you would like, so let me know :)**",3,1729599896.0,fuseboxgames,0,0.8,False

I’m a 33-year-old guy, comfortably situated in Mumbai, yet continuously exploring the wider world—mostly through the lens of food, travel documentaries, and an irrational belief that watching foreign-language films without subtitles counts as a workout for the brain. I’m looking for someone who, like me, appreciates the beauty in life’s absurdities and can keep up with a witty exchange over a plate of something delicious (don’t worry, I’m vegetarian—let’s keep it plant-based and pleasant).

A Little About Me:

Mumbai is my home base, but my curiosity extends far beyond its crowded streets. While the world may see the city as an unending marathon of honking, bustling, and running late, I prefer to think of it as an ongoing lesson in the art of improvisation—whether that’s finding new routes through traffic or coming up with creative excuses to avoid social events (I'm thriving on this front!)

In terms of hobbies, I enjoy immersing myself in new experiences: trying exotic cuisine (with vegetarian adaptations, of course), navigating new cultural quirks, or attempting to pronounce European dessert names with the confidence of a native speaker.

What I’m Looking For:

1. A Culinary Co-Conspirator: I’m on a lifelong quest to explore the intersection of delicious and nutritious, ideally in the form of street food that manages to leave us both satisfied and slightly guilty. I’m hoping to find someone who’s willing to debate whether authentic Italian pizza should be thin or whether we’re allowed to enjoy it as a meal without turning it into a personality trait.

&nbsp;
2. Intellectual Debater of the Utterly Unimportant: I’m seeking a partner who can engage in profound discussions about the trivial—like why coffee culture is taken so seriously when most people can’t even remember which milk alternative they ordered. Someone who isn’t above analyzing why reality shows around the world are essentially a global conspiracy to make us feel better about our life choices.

&nbsp;
3. Embraces Life’s Quirks: I’d love to meet someone who finds humor in life’s little hiccups, and who doesn’t require everything to be meticulously planned. Life is unpredictable and often hilarious if you take a step back—much like that time I confidently ordered a traditional Finnish dish at a pop-up food festival only to discover that “traditional” meant “bewildering.”

&nbsp;
4. Adventurer with Realistic Expectations: I appreciate the thrill of discovering hidden gems, whether they’re new books, uncharted restaurants, or the rare social interaction that doesn’t end with awkward small talk. But let’s agree that adventures don’t always have to involve extreme sports; sometimes, it’s simply about trying a dish you can’t pronounce or exploring a museum exhibit that you accidentally stumbled upon.



What I’d Prefer to Avoid:

The Instagram Obsessive: While I love a good photo now and then, if your primary aim at a café is to stage a photoshoot for your matcha latte rather than drink it, we might run into some difficulties. I’m more interested in conversations than captions.

The Morning Motivator: I respect (shallowly) people who enjoy waking up at the crack of dawn to “embrace the day” forwards, but personally, I’m more interested in embracing a leisurely brunch with strong coffee, and get the day started. Let’s save the motivational mantras for when we’re trying to navigate travel delays or existential crises.

Those Without a Sense of Humor About Themselves: If you can’t laugh at the occasional mishap, like confidently attempting to order food in a foreign language and accidentally asking for the bill instead, then you’re missing out on life’s best comedic moments.


If you’re someone who appreciates good conversation, global adventures (both real and culinary), and can find joy in the unpredictable, let’s chat! I’m looking for a fellow explorer of life’s many flavors and a co-conspirator in navigating both the literal and metaphorical traffic jams of our day-to-day lives. Let’s make plans that sound impressive on paper but inevitably devolve into us eating takeout while watching a documentary about minimalism and judging the filmmakers for owning more furniture than we do. If that sounds like your idea of a good time, drop me a message! And if it doesn’t, well … let’s both pretend you accidentally clicked on this ad and gracefully move on.

So the story is as is ( at least the way I know it). 
I ( 34 F) have a friend (33 F) whom I met at work back in 2013. With time we became best friends that we both know so much about each other on a personal level that we consider ourselves to be more of sisters than friends . 
Around 3 years ago ( sometime in 2021) I was openly talking to her about applying for the local University and pursue a PhD (part time) she was neutral about it and just listened. I then put that on hold because I became pregnant with my first and wanted to sort my personal life before getting back to the academic life. 
I remember that during that time she asked about the requirements for the Uni applications and that was it. 
Moving forward to early 2022, I knew from a colleague that she is attending a course with him, she started her PhD program  and I had no Idea and had to pretend to the guy that I knew about it because it took me by surprise.
I kept quiet and didn’t tell her that I knew about just to give her the chance to tell me whenever she is ready. 
Moving forward to 2024. 
She started to change , we started to have less coffee breaks and never met out of work as we used to. I tried to invite her so many times and gave all the time to talk about anything anything but no she still kept silent. She would tell me that she got back home late but won’t say it was because of a class she was attending, she would even post photos of uni camp that she knows i will see. 
She then started attempts to embarrass me in work meetings ( a meeting that i never invited her for). The last straw was when we met in hallway and gave me the yellow smiles someone would give strangers or people they barely know and continued to walk her way. I deleted her from all social media accounts and when we attended a work event I pretended that I didn’t see her.

I know I gave her more chances than she deserves. It still hurts the way she suddenly changed and started to treat me that way. I know I am not in the wrong here as I have never treated her with anything but respect but I don’t know why I am feeling that way.

Chapter 1

As the elevator plummeted from the top floor, a violent drop that seemed endless yet painfully brief.

I felt the sharp pain and blood seeping through my clothes. My mind screamed at the horror of it all, because my baby, the tiny life inside me, slipped away.

As soon as the paramedics arrived, they wrapped me in blood-streaked bandages, lifting my broken body onto a stretcher.

There, I saw a glimpse of my boyfriend, Nicholas Richmond, who came back from the meeting with his secretary, Courtney Miller.

His arm protectively curled around Courtney, then he shielded her eyes with a gentle touch, whispering, “Do not look. It is too awful.”

Without another glance, they stepped through the doors and into the building, leaving me behind.

The realization was like a second fall. It seemed that five years was nothing for him, because I was never that important to Nicholas, while Courtney’s sweet smile would always occupy his every thought.

That time, I made a decision I had hesitated before, a job offer from a rival company that had been on the table for weeks.

I called them. “I am ready to accept your offe!”

——

After two long days in the hospital, I was finally discharged.

Yet, despite my release, there was no relief. The ache in my heart was far deeper than the physical wounds.

I was leaving the hospital alone, no longer carrying the life I had just discovered was growing inside me.

The morning of the accident had been surreal. A positive test, a flutter of hope, then a nightmare unfolding before I had even grasped the reality.

While packing my few belongings, I whispered to myself, “I do not even know how far along I was.”

The thought cut through me like a knife. The baby in my belly had been too small and too fragile after all.

Suddenly, the door to my room creaked open, pulling me from my thoughts.

For a brief, foolish moment, I hoped it was Nicholas. But it was not. A driver stood there instead.

“Miss McLain, Mr. Richmond had a sudden meeting. He sent me to pick you up,” the driver explained, his voice polite and detached. “Let me carry your things.”

I exhaled slowly, feeling the familiar sting of disappointment.

Nicholas always had an excuse, something pressing, something more important. But when Courtney needed anything, he was never too busy.

Two days in the hospital, and not once did he show his face. He had not called, had not come. Nothing.

“No need. I have got it,” I replied, forcing a smile as I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked out.

The ride home was quiet. The city lights flickered past in a blur, but I could not focus on anything outside the window.

Inside, it felt darker than the night itself. By the time we pulled up to the house, I was numb.

“We are here, Miss,” the driver said, gently bringing me back to the present.

I reached for my handbag, preparing to step out when something caught my eye. Tucked between the seat cushions was a delicate piece of blue dress, which was not mine.

My stomach twisted. I discreetly grabbed it, slipping it into my bag before the driver opened my door.

Once in my room, I tossed the blue dress onto my dresser, trying to ignore the painful questions racing through my mind. Who did it belong to? And why was it there?

The shower indeed washed away the grime of the hospital, but it did nothing to cleanse the doubt that simmered within me.

However, I brushed it off and climbed into bed, hoping for sleep.

When morning came, I woke to the familiar yet unsettling sight of Nicholas lying beside me.

It had become a routine: him slipping into bed unnoticed after I had already fallen asleep, as if our lives had become nothing more than parallel lines.

We were close, but never touching anymore.

His eyes fluttered open under my gaze. “You are awake?” he asked, his voice groggy with sleep.

I did not respond. Instead, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat in silence.

“If you are still feeling unwell, you do not need to go into work,” he added, sitting up.

“There is too much piling up. I cannot afford to take more time off,” I replied.

My words were flat, emotionless, but inside, a plan was taking shape. I needed to finish what was left at the office, so I could hand in my resignation and leave that life behind.

Nicholas nodded, oblivious to the distance between us. “Well, after all your injuries are just superficial. You will heal quickly,” he said, slipping into the bathroom, phone in hand, as was his routine.

I watched the door close behind him in disappointment.

He used to take showers fast, but it changed lately. With his phone always in tow, the duration stretched.

However, I could not bring myself to care anymore. I made my way to a different bathroom, determined to avoid him for as long as possible.

When I finished dressing, Nicholas was already sitting on the sofa, a newspaper in hand. He glanced up at me, sarcasm lacing his words. “Skipping our morning coffee ritual? You must be in quite the rush.”

I ignored his attempt at humor, my voice devoid of any warmth. “It slipped my mind.”

A sigh escaped him as he set the paper down. “Fine. Let’s get to the office early then.”

We had always gone to the office together, ever since deciding to move in three years ago.

Back then, everything felt aligned. We had the same goals, the same routines. But lately, I had begun to feel a shift, a subtle but unmistakable discomfort creeping in.

Nicholas seemed more attached to his phone than to me. Even when I grew distant, hoping he would notice, he carried on as though nothing had changed, like my silence meant nothing.

That morning, I sat quietly in the car as Nicholas, focused on his phone, suddenly spoke up. ""I need coffee. Let’s stop by the takeaway to get breakfast,"" he said to the driver, not sparing me a glance.

“Yes, sir,” the driver replied, the words punctuated by the quiet tap of Nicholas's fingers on his screen.

From the corner of my eye, I could see him chatting with Courtney, his secretary.

\[Nicholas: I left early because Frey had a lot to catch up on after taking yesterday off. Do not rush though, take your time this morning.\]

\[Courtney: I understand, her team has been busy lately, so she must feel guilty about it. You also should take it easy, Nick. Your schedule is light today, just some proposals to review and a meeting later.\]

\[Nicholas: Good. Can you also make a reservation at the usual place for lunch?\]

\[Courtney: Of course! Any preference on what to try today?\]

I stopped reading after that, feeling the sting of their easy camaraderie.

Plans, always plans, but never with me. I was not part of the lunches or the lighthearted conversations. It was as if they were the ones in a relationship, not Nicholas and I.

So, what was I to him, really?

Soon, we arrived at the takeaway. Nicholas rolled down the window, casually giving his order.

“I want a hot Americano and an iced Americano. Oh, and a caramel Frappe too. Plus, one chocolate croissant and two peanut butter croissants. That will be all.”

I did not think much of it at first, assuming he ordered more for the driver. But after collecting the food, he handed me the iced Americano and peanut butter croissant.

I stared at the croissant, stunned.

‘After five years, did he still not remember that I am allergic to peanuts?’ I wondered.
