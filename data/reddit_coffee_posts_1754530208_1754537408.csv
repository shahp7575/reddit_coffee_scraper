1mjpd9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TRIUMPHQWE/comments/1mjpd9o/how_to_pick_the_perfect_nightstand_a_nostress/,How to Pick the Perfect Nightstand: A No-Stress Guide for Your Bedroom Upgrade,"Let’s be real—nightstands are the unsung heroes of the bedroom. They hold your phone, your late-night snack, that half-read book, and maybe even a secret stash of snacks (no judgment). But picking the right one? It can feel trickier than choosing a Netflix show. Fear not—here’s how to nail it:

1. Size Matters (But It’s Not Everything)

First, measure the space next to your bed! You don’t want a nightstand that’s so big it blocks the door, or so small it can’t even hold your lamp. Aim for a height that’s roughly level with your mattress (give or take a few inches) so you’re not stretching or bending to grab things. Pro tip: If your bed is low, skip the super tall nightstand—it’ll look out of place.

2. Storage: Form vs. Function

Ask yourself: Do I need a place to hide clutter, or am I more about a clean, minimalist vibe?

\- Drawers/cabinets: Great for stashing chargers, meds, or extra blankets so your top stays clear.

\- Open shelves: Perfect if you want easy access to books, a cute plant, or your favorite candle (just avoid piling stuff up—chaos = stress).

\- No storage?: A simple table works if you’re low on space or prefer a sleek look, but keep a small basket nearby for odds and ends.

3. Style: Match Your Vibe (But Don’t Overthink It)

Your nightstand should play nice with your bed and bedroom decor, but “matchy-matchy” isn’t a rule. Mix materials (wood + metal, anyone?) or go for a contrasting color to add personality. If your bed is busy (think tufted fabric or bold patterns), keep the nightstand simple. If your bed is plain, a fun design (curved legs, a unique finish) can be the star.

4. Practical Extras

\- Power outlet built-in: A game-changer for charging phones/tablets without messy cords.

\- Waterproof top: Essential if you’re prone to spilling coffee or leaving a wet glass out (we’ve all been there).

\- Sturdy construction: Wiggle test! A wobbly nightstand will drive you crazy—spend a little more for something solid.

5. Budget: You Don’t Have to Splurge

Nightstands range from $50 to $500+, and you don’t need to break the bank. Thrift stores, Facebook Marketplace, or even a DIY project (hello, repurposed crate!) can give you a unique piece that fits your budget. Just prioritize durability over flash—you’ll use this daily!

At the end of the day, the best nightstand is one that makes your bedtime routine easier. What’s your must-have feature? Drop a comment—I’m always here for nightstand hacks or horror stories (we’ve all bought a dud).

Sweet dreams (and happy shopping)!",1,1754537116.0,u_TRIUMPHQWE,0,1.0,False
1mjpd3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1mjpd3c/dog_exposed_to_parvo/,Dog Exposed to Parvo,"Short story long, yesterday as I was walking to get a cup of coffee I found two abandoned puppies and immediately took them home since it was raining and 65° - horrible conditions for puppies to be left out in (or any dog but certainly these small pups who I’d estimate to be ~5 weeks old). Here are the order of events:
1. Returned home with travel carrier puppies were found. Set carrier on cement porch. 
2. Let my dog out to do soft intro while they’re in crate so he doesn’t loose his mind in when I move them inside. He approaches carrier but I tell him to “leave it” which creates distance. 
3. I take off shoes and go inside to get old blanket. I bring my dog in with me.
4. I come back out to evict pups from carrier since they won’t leave it (I basically turn gently so they slide out). They move to blanket which is laid out on porch but do come in contact with cement porch. 
5. I wrap pups in blanket and move them to bathtub to wash with soap and warm water. One of them wees in the tub - dish soap is my temporary solution to this.
6. Once they are in the rub and rinsed I quickly throw blanket and towel in dryer - one does climb out of the tub but is placed back in within a few seconds.
6. After they are washed I run to the dryer and grab the towel and blanket - blanket is thrown in Ruffland crate and towel is used to dry them off. From being dried they are set in the crate (set right outside the bathroom in a sitting area where my dog’s kennel is (Orvis travel kennel). 
7. I set a disposable bowl in their crate with water, cleaned the bathtub with a bleach cleaner, changed my clothes, and set the clothes and the towel in a pile to clean later. 
8. I then started local animal clinics again (first calls made when I initially found them on the street with no answer) and found a place that would take them in the following day at 9AM (it was 2:00PM when I found them and got them home). 
9. I let them be while I returned to my home office and would  check in on them every 30 minutes or so. (They were downstairs, I was upstairs, and my dog fluctuated between his upstairs kennel and downstairs kennel). 
10. At one point in the afternoon I decided to check in on the pups and hold them and let them know they’d be okay. My dog was in proximity to the pups at this point but never made contact and eventually I had him go into his Orvis crate. The pups were in a 4 ft space for about 30 seconds - as I quickly realized this was a bad idea as one moved into the bathroom and wizzed on the tile (I cleaned this up immediately with paper towel and then lysol wipes). The other one did something similar, by wizzing on the wood floor right outside of the crate - again it was paper toweled then lysoled. The pups were placed back in the crate. 
11. After this I went thru the entire house with a swiffer wet floor cleaner to sanitize everything since I had my friends dogs over the past weekend and figured the time was right. 
12. I then biked to get the pups a thing of wet food (recommended by the clinic).
13. After my return I washed my clothing, bath mats, and towel because they were in contact with the pups. And then I watched my couch cushion covers on a sanitary cycle because my friends dogs were on the couch and I figured it could use a wash, too.
14. My dog and I sat out on the cement porch to read and the we came back in to go to bed (my dog sleeps in bed with me).
15. Wake up and move pup crate from sitting area to front door (pass thru kitchen and living room). 
16. Grab pups and set them outside in grass so they can potty. 
17. Move crate to front porch to grab contents (blanket, newspaper, bowl, and food) and dispose of them in trash bag.
18. Move crate back inside next to front door, lay down new paper, and grab pups from lawn to set back in crate.
19. Finish work, move pups from crate to cardboard box for transport with new blanket on bottom, get in uber, take pups to clinic and LEARN THEY ARE PARVO POSITIVE. 
20. Immediately start freaking out because that person who broke the parvo news also tells me I need to get my dog to the vet asap, I need to bleach everything in my house, and throw most everything away.
21. I call my regular vet who assures me my dog is going to be  okay, his DAPP is good thru 2026 and this probably isn’t the first time he’s been exposed, it’s just the first time I’m aware of it. She doesn’t think I need to come in ASAP and instead schedules us for 5 days out with the understanding if he falls ill they’ll see him immediately. 
22. I return home, change,  go to the store and purchase an abundance of cleaning supplies and immediately start bleaching everything I have touched or been near and everything my dog has touched or been near in the last 24H. This includes mopping the floors with bleach, letting air dry, and mopping again (I say mopping but I actually bought Miracloth all-purpose surface towels, dunked them in the 1:3 bleach concoction and used those on my swiffer attachment to clean the floors. After cycling thru one for each room, I put them in the laundry on the sanitary setting with more bleach and then hit them with the highest heat dryer setting before dunking and mopping again). I also wiped the porch down in the bleach mixture as did the porch steps and the stone walkway leading from my driveway to the porch. Door knobs? Bleached. Clothing and bedding? Bleached. Computer keyboard and mouse? Bleached. The book I read with my dog on the patio last night? You guessed it. Bleached. I could see myself going slightly manic and cleaning everything I touched yesterday with bleach but I am trying to refrain because that seems unreasonable and I practically washed my hands raw yesterday.
23. I also threw out all shoes worn in the last 24H, both of my dogs crate beds, towels, door mats, socks, the soap I used on the pups, and toys my dog may have chewed in the last 24H. I am going to bleach the Ruffland kennel multiple times over the next few days to attempt to spare it but if I’m not fully confident I will put it to the curb. 

Things to note:
1. My dog is a 7 y/o Germans Shepherd in great health. He goes with me everywhere and encounters a great amount of dogs and environments. 
2. The pups only urinated in my home in two isolated spaces and these accidents were immediately cleaned up.
3. I don’t believe the dogs threw up in the crate. 
4. In the morning one of them went #2 in the crate (not solid) but it was on the paper. 
5. The pups only went into the front yard and I don’t think either went #2. My dog will not be allowed in the front yard for the foreseeable future. They were thirsty and drank a lot of water but did not seem interested in eating. They were in good spirits!

Am I missing anything in terms of precautions I should be taking to protect my dog? Am I missing anything in terms of cleaning?? 

As an animal lover, my first instinct was to get these pups into a safe space. Parvo/sickness didn’t even cross my mind. I don’t regret taking them in. Now, I can refocus on decontaminating my home and making sure my dog is a-okay. Any insight will be appreciated!!! <3 ",2,1754537100.0,DogAdvice,2,1.0,False

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With the events of last night, we called for a rest day. No activities, everyone just needed a breather to fully rest, heal, and for me to figure out what the hell was going on. I announced to the unaffected campers that due to an accident occurring last night, we would be having another rest day. Most didn’t pry, but gave me questioning looks as I left the stage. At this point, Pam became increasingly worried about her own kids, who had spent numerous hours in the areas where these events took place. Even worse, her kids began repeating about the ""strange men"" they saw when they were swimming. She opted to pick up everything and leave, saying she would come back once this situation had smoothed over and her kids started talking normally again. Can’t blame her, really. 

We banned campers from going anywhere near the water, putting a rope tied between two cabins with a sign so nobody forgot. Really it was a lame attempt to stop anyone, but there was no way to fully block off the entrance. The first rest day was somewhat normal in comparison to what was to come. The affected campers mostly found a closet or secluded space to hide. Once I felt less rattled from the prior night events myself, I went to check in on them. 

Most refused to talk to me, barring themselves away from anyone to see. The campers watched nervously, unsure fully what was going on. The only two who let me look at them were Jo and Leanne. They were in the same outhouse outside of cabin green. 

“Jo? Leanne? We know you're in there”

“...”

“Please, we are getting worried about you. We just want to make sure you two are okay. Do you need anything? You can ask me anything, I promise I will try to help you” what else was I supposed to say? 

The door swung open, and the two girls were huddled in the corner of the stall. Their skin all the way up to their necks were saggy, like Hilda's. It looked like both of them had the body of an old woman, and the face of a child. Their skin sagged unnaturally, looking bruised and veiny the closer it got to their legs. Their ankles looked the worst, with near rotting blackened flesh. It looked like the flesh of someone who had recently died. 

I suppose I had a hard time stopping my facial expression, as Jo burst out into tears. 

“I promise we are trying to find someone to help you. Do you need anything? Can you tell me anything about last night?” I asked in quick succession. 

“We breached curfew” Leanne choked, before refusing to talk to me again. 

Most campers silently used the amenities, such as sitting around the fire. The camp counselors did the same thing. I asked Marjorie to break the events to them, even though in my heart they were still kids like my campers. I found myself in a panic again, with Bill and Marjorie trying to convince the affected campers to leave their hiding spots to eat, to me spam calling the police department in the area. 

Nothing. All calls went unanswered. Eventually, my cabin phone line went dead. I tried calling other numbers, even using my cellphone, nothing. It was like we were in a dead zone for service. I begged any campers to come forward with their cellphones in case they brought theirs secretly, nobody fessed up. Or maybe they were better listeners than I thought and didn’t bring their phones at all. 

I was exhausted, so was Marjorie and Bill. It was 11pm and we all found ourselves drinking coffee and trying to discuss what to do in the admin cabin. We had been talking ourselves into circles trying to put together a rational explanation for these afflictions. I couldn’t help but to stare down at my legs, inspecting them to see if they were getting older too. 

“I’m going to watch the beach tonight” Bill declared after a moment of silence, going to stand up.

“No- no no wait. I’m just worried if you do, the light will get to you too. We are already down Pam, I can’t lose another one of you” I said weakly. Bill gave me a weird look.

“Honey, we don’t know what it is yet. It could be dangerous” Marjorie looked at Bill calmly. 

“No, I’m not having any more of these children get hurt. It won’t hurt me. You said it makes them old, right?” he looked at me

“Well, I mean it makes the skin look old. Who knows about their uh…. Insides? It could just be cosmetic, “ I said hesitantly. 

“Look at me, do you think I could get any more damn old? I can’t let them get hurt. If you need me, or get worried, I have my radio” Bill stood up, putting back on his cap and throwing his heavier flannel jacket. 

I sighed. He was right. 

Bill left the cabin with the slam of a door. Marjorie sighed along with me. 

“Hes a stubborn bag, my husband, I love him, that's my problem” she chuckled emptily. 

“I really don’t think this is a good idea” I commented

“Neither do I” 

“Should we,,,”

Silence. 

“We need to figure out this phone situation” I said firmly

“I thought you were getting Pam to call?” Marjorie asked innocently

“No, I have no phone to tell her to phone” I said more sternly than I meant to. 

“Oh, heh. Right. And you checked with the campers? No cellphones?”

“None. Or at least none wanted to give one to me” I replied

“Do you think it is an area wide blockage?” Marjorie asked 

“No clue. Thing is, the only number I have on hand is the volunteer police guys. I don’t even know how helpful they would be if we called them now. 

“Do you think… I have Bill and I’s truck. Maybe I could drive out to an RCMP detachment. I know there's one outside of Bellpoint” 

A rush of anxiety hit me for the fourth or fifth time that day. That means it would just be Bill and I until Marjorie returned. I love Bill, but Marjorie always seems to have her head more straight. But what other option was there? Cell outages can happen for kilometers in this area due to the distance away from a cell tower. It might be out for another week or two. I was running out of options. 

“Okay, yeah okay you should do that. How long will it take you?”

“Well, likely at least 5 or 6 hours one way. I could make it, maybe I could head out in a couple hours?” Marjorie replied. 

“Yeah, I guess that's what we will have to do” 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I stared blankly at the water in the early hours of the next morning at Bill's jacket floated lifelessly on the surface. Not only this, but several other articles of clothing floated in the lake, such as swimming suits, shirts and shorts. All kids and teen sizes. There was a harsh silence. When I tried to radio Bill this morning, it came back as no signal. It was still in his pocket. I barely remembered how I got there, but that's the next scene I remembered. My legs felt more sore than they usually did just to run there. 

I denied it at first, figuring that maybe they were fine and just threw their jackets and clothes into the water. Maybe it was a prank, a joke, a facade. My eyes twitched as I scanned the shore. No bootprints in the muddy bank, just prints walking into the water. 

My eyes peered to the left where I knew the counselors parked their cars. I already knew they fled. I heard whispers of it the day before. Trust me, I really wish I could flee right now too. They are in the lucky situation of only being here for the paycheque. This is my whole life, my home  and my income. I care for these people. And I could protect them up until now. I failed. 

I had no phone, Marjorie was gone, Bill was… and the counselors abandoned me. I walked back to camp in a daze. The wind was silent, only brushing against the tips of the trees. 

I was knocked awake when I saw the state of the remaining campers. 

Most had partially or fully wrinkled skin. Many of them sat in their normal lounging spots as they had been days before. 

It was like something was puppeting them to act like campers, while doing it all wrong. Two kids sat by an unlit firepit, staring blankly into where a fire was supposed to be. They ambiantly picked at their skin, with parts of bone starting to become visible. They wouldn’t look up at me.  Four campers stood in volleyball playing positions, completely frozen, as if waiting for the ball to come. The rest were in similar conditions all around camp. One simply sat against the wall of cabin pink, with only his ankles being sagged and worn. It was Matthew. 

I sat next to him. I felt defeated and lost, there was no hope left. I felt like I myself was walking around like a zombie. I wish I could make any of this make more sense. 

“It was like a stampede,” Matthew spoke. I quickly turned to look at him. 

“It was late at night, and something compelled everyone to run. It was primal. It woke us up from our sleep. I was trampled, I was never quick out of bed” 

“Why didn’t it wake us up?” 

“Bill tried to stop us, but there were too many. Most dived in, some walked in. Others took their time. The ones who jumped in, it was like cotton candy to water. They were gone. It was so dark” Matthew closed his eyes. 

“What… who-” I stammered

“I can’t stand the dark” Matthew curled in on himself. That was the last he spoke, despite my prying.  

Before I had time to react, two figures stood before me. I didn’t bother to look up. One had jeans and the other had a heavy coat going past his knees. 

“We need to chat, we have answers”. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The signal men took me back to my cabin, and sat me down at the table where I last saw Bill and Marjorie. The men had left for 20 minutes, but were now returning. They made some small talk going in, before sitting next to me. My eyes were trained on the floor, My stress was so bad that I practically picked my finger nails off. 

“Macy, can you hear us?” the jeans one said

“Mhm” I spoke

“We got a lot to tell you, so I need you fully here with us” 

I looked up. The one in jeans was gaunt with dark brown hair. He had a patch of scruff on his face, and his shirt was nicely tucked in. The other had taken off his coat, he was on the heavier side, wore a hoodie, and was blonde. 

“Are those kids okay? Is Bill okay?” 

“We’ll get to that, for now we need to explain who we are-”

“You’re the signal men, I know that” 

The blonde one snickered at this, before the dark haired one responded

“Ah- no. We have names, That's technically our fathers. I’m Samuel and my cousin here is Henry. We have been here across from lake kiwetotam for several generations” Samuel finished

“Really?”

“Yes, our job, our life, is to keep control of the lake. It started with our grandparents, went to our fathers, then to us” 

“Keep control…?”

“Lake kiwetotam is… different from other lakes in the area. We were never given the full story for how it became how it has, but we do know it was from some creature granting it sentience Once it gained sentience, it was infused with a deep hatred of people. We theorized it learnt of the abuse humans had put its fellow kinship through, and it became a site which could beckon humans in” 

“To kill them?”

“No, to return their bodies to the earth. It uses the bodies to nourish the water and the trees. That's its goal, lake kiwetotam, to return the next generation of humans to the earth rather than to perpetuate the abuse” Samuel spoke softly. 

“But how do you-” 

“Our grandfathers tested the waters and found that human created items could affect the rate at which the lake could influence the minds of people. Specifically, man made light. The presence of a flickering spotlight, if present at least once or twice a night, would keep it at bay. This also would mean it would only need monitoring at night” Samuel continued

“We have no clue how it works,” Henry added in. 

I paused, this was a lot of information to throw at me. The lake was sentient… and was kept at bay by only this one family? How did all of this happen? Were they really telling the truth?

“But why come now? Why didn’t you tell me before I started this camp? I would have never done such a thing if I knew otherwise” I demanded. 

“You can barely believe us even after seeing it for yourself” Henry said flatly. 

“Hilda said you guys only come out at night anyways, I guess” I mumbled 

“We had to come out during the day because things are getting out of control. What matters is that several of your campers have been lured and returned to the lake. The ones who we were able to save have had parts of their psyche taken, returning them to an animalistic state. We think we can save them, but you need to trust us” Samuel finished. 

“What do you mean out of control?”

“We can keep the lake at bay for only so many years. Give me your keys” Henry demanded. 

“What! I barely know you two people, and you want to take my keys? How can I trust-” I stood up, but their eyes darted to my hands. I looked down too, causing me to cringe in disgust. My hands and legs looked more decrepit than before. Bright veins and wrinkles popped, and purple bruises and moles were galore. I sat back down, feeling dizzy. I could barely make eye contact with them. 

“I think that ends our conversation. You are in no state to help us any further, and you don’t have the capacity to understand much else” the cousins stood up, grabbing my loop of keys from my jeans.  

“What the hell does that mean?! I went into that sludge to save my campers, I still have my brain and my psyche! Don’t you dare compare me to them. Who in the world even are you people??” I screamed as they walked past me. I wanted to get up, but my legs felt too weak to move. 

“Don’t you fucking leave me?! Marjorie will be coming back any minute, she will let me out of here!”

As they walked out, heavy thumps could be heard against the door. Once I was able to get the energy to stand up, I realized the door would no longer open. They knew it couldn’t be locked from the outside. The windows were solid glass, and I watched as the campers outside were aggressively grabbed and dragged back to one single cabin by the men. There was nothing that screaming and crying could do now. 

I’m still here, laying against the wall near the window. Slowly I feel myself sinking into the floorboards as my rotting flesh begins to eat into the wood. It was pretty painful at first, but now it feels calm. I hear yelling, cursing, like a herd of angry dogs barking outside. With my one eye I can see the flashes which, even during the day, illuminate my cabin. But soon it will come to a standstill. 

Maybe it was I that angered the lake. I came here after winning all this money, all to clear out all the trees and brush, remove the animals, everything. Even worse, I brought more cabins and people here, to trample over its hairy skin. Maybe it was patient with me for years until finally, lake kiwetotam was sick of us. I had angered the spirit, and now it would reclaim me. It would reclaim all of us. I deserved this, we all deserve this. We are all going to rot. 

I want to thank everyone for coming out to camp kiwetotam this year, and I hope to see all your smiling faces in 2025.",1,1754537065.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mjp9ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1mjp9ve/am_i_expecting_too_much/,Am I expecting too much?,"I (33F) started speaking to a guy (34M) in May this year. We have the same profession and so we clicked in some way. We have had calls almost everyday and every call has lasted atleast an hour. 

Here is the catch: The calls are ALWAYS when he is doing something while talking to me AND other people around him. I feel like a fool waiting for him to finish up and give his complete attention to me which does not happen for more than 10min. I have tried to disconnect while telling him that he may call when he is free, but he doesn’t let me go off the phone. Also, when my dad spoke to him for the first time my dad suggested that we should video calls as it is not possible to meet so soon. The guy never brought up doing a video calls and we talked only through audio all the time. 

In July he planned to come to India. On the last Sunday of July, he and his mom visited our house and he didn’t speak as much as he talks on the phone. There were a couple of times where our gaze met, and I smiled slightly, but he didn’t smile back. My dad had to tell him 4 times to go somewhere outside to talk to me in private. His mom also nudged him once. Finally I got up to go and so he had to get up. On our way to a cafe, he didn’t speak much and I felt soo awkward. I felt he didn’t like me and he was there forcefully. I paid for the cab, he didn’t even offer to pay. He simply shut the door of the cab while I was inside paying the driver. I felt like I had come alone. 

In the cafe he behaved better. He paid for the coffee even though I insisted I pay. He brought up a topic we had already spoken about and there was still some awkwardness while I was pissed and sad and the series of events that were happening and so I too couldn’t carry the conversation. He didn’t even drop a casual compliment. He casually mentioned “aap log bhi aaoge humaare yaha” I couldn’t mutter a yes and he repeated himself and I hesitantly said “haan aayenge”. I asked him if I should book the return cab and he immediately agreed like he was waiting for it.

But the next day and the days after, he kept in touch with me the same way he used to do in the US. I asked him bluntly how did he like everything during his visit to our place. He said “badhiya tha. But abhi mummy se discussion ho nahi paya hai” (It was good but I am yet to discuss with my mom). We kept talking for the next couple of days and then I withdrew. Because he wasn’t giving me any clarity. I felt he is hesitant to reject me. So, I pulled the plug and he started clarifying himself that he is not disinterested at all and he was just busy and forgot to bring up what he and his mom had discussed. Finally after a lot of stressful drama over this me and my parents visited his house last Sunday. 

At his house, when both of us were asked to talk in private, I emphasised if he is interested to marry at all? As I never saw any enthusiasm or excitement from him. He clarified himself in detail that it doesn’t ‘click’ to him in personal relationships. He said he can do what is to be done if nudged but it doesn’t occur to him by itself naturally. He reassured that it is not his disinterest. He asked me if me and my family had come with any “preparation”, I said no because of your behaviour, I asked my parents to not do a roka for now. When we went back to the drawing room where everyone else was, his mom insisted that a roka be done as he was flying back to the US the next day. My dad politely refused by saying we like the alliance but we need more time and we haven’t come with preparations for a roka. 

We are still talking over the phone and we have asked for a month’s time to decide. 

My problem with him is: He has never complimented me, never flirted even the slightest, never held hands, talks to me on the phone without never paying full attention to me. Is he shy? Or gay? I expect some flirting/romantic vibe at this stage. Am I expecting too much?",1,1754536826.0,Arrangedmarriage,1,1.0,False

**The Problem with Sign Violations in NYC**

If you run a business in New York City, you know how important signage is. But what you may not know—until it’s too late—is how easy it is to end up with a violation. One morning you arrive at your shop or office and find a bright yellow violation sticker from the Department of Buildings (DOB) slapped on your door. It’s a frustrating, often expensive surprise that no business owner wants to deal with.

Sign violations in NYC can cost thousands in fines and even lead to forced removals or shutdowns. Whether it's an unpermitted sign, a structure that's too large, or an installation that violates safety codes, the city doesn't play around when it comes to enforcement. And the worst part? Most of these violations happen because business owners simply don’t know the rules.

https://preview.redd.it/79odinmomihf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ec8b92523d0bde50e8c2850da039be6b2b2ed34

**Why Tru-Art Sign Co. Is the Go-To Solution**

Enter Tru-Art Sign Co.—your trusted expert for fast, efficient, and professional [**violation removal in NYC**](https://www.truartsignco.com/violations-or-permits/). With decades of experience navigating the city’s complex signage regulations, Tru-Art has helped hundreds of businesses resolve violations, avoid massive fines, and get back to business without the headaches.

Unlike companies that offer only partial solutions, Tru-Art handles every part of the process. From understanding your violation notice to repairing, replacing, or legalizing your signage, they make the problem go away—fast and hassle-free. They're not just experts—they’re your advocate in dealing with the city.

**Understanding NYC Sign Violations**

**Common Causes of Violations**

NYC signage laws are some of the most detailed and restrictive in the country. Business owners often fall into traps without realizing it, leading to violations such as:

* Installing signs without a permit
* Exceeding allowable size or height
* Using prohibited lighting or materials
* Mounting signs in restricted zones or historical districts
* Failing to display the contractor’s name or DOB license on the sign

Sometimes violations result from previous owners or contractors who cut corners, leaving you to deal with the fallout. The NYC DOB doesn’t care who caused the problem—they hold the current property or business owner responsible.

**Impact on Businesses**

Getting hit with a sign violation is more than just an inconvenience. It can directly impact your operations. In some cases, it can:

* Lead to immediate fines from $800 to $10,000 or more
* Affect your ability to obtain or renew business licenses
* Create legal liabilities if your sign is deemed unsafe
* Damage your business reputation

And because violations are public record, they can also scare away potential customers, investors, or partners. In a competitive market like NYC, that kind of damage is hard to recover from.

**Types of Sign Violations Issued by the DOB**

**Illegal Installations**

One of the most common reasons businesses receive violations is for signs installed without the proper permits. If a sign goes up without DOB approval, even if it seems harmless, it’s considered illegal and subject to removal and fines.

**Lack of Permits**

Even minor signage changes—like replacing a letter or adding illumination—may require a permit. Skipping this step can lead to a Notice of Violation (NOV), often followed by an Environmental Control Board (ECB) or Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) summons.

**Safety Code Violations**

Signs must meet strict safety standards. That includes structural integrity, electrical wiring, and weatherproofing. Any installation that poses a risk to public safety—like a loose, hanging sign or outdated electrical box—will be flagged.

**Over-Sized Signage**

NYC signage regulations also dictate the maximum allowable size for commercial signs based on zoning, location, and building size. Oversized signs often trigger violations, especially in mixed-use or residential-adjacent zones.

**Why You Should Act Fast**

**Fines and Penalties**

Time is money, and nowhere is that truer than in NYC’s violation system. Ignoring a sign violation doesn’t make it disappear—it just makes it worse. Daily fines accumulate quickly, and a simple oversight can snowball into a $10,000+ problem.

The longer you wait, the more complex the situation becomes. In some cases, the city may issue a “Cure” period, giving you a short window to fix the problem before penalties hit. Miss that deadline, and you’re in for serious financial trouble.

**Business Disruption**

A violation can prevent you from advertising effectively, opening a new location, or completing renovations. Some violations even halt operations entirely until the issue is resolved. For retail stores, restaurants, and small businesses, this downtime is devastating.

Tru-Art helps businesses act fast to minimize financial damage and keep operations running smoothly. Their team understands the urgency and offers priority service for businesses under violation.

**How Tru-Art Handles Violation Removal**

**Step-by-Step Process**

When you partner with Tru-Art, they take full ownership of the violation removal process. Here’s how it works:

1. **Violation Assessment:** Tru-Art reviews the DOB notice and inspects your current signage setup.
2. **Compliance Strategy:** They create a step-by-step plan to bring your sign into full compliance.
3. **Permit Filing:** Their team handles all permit applications, plans, and filings with the DOB.
4. **Corrective Work:** Whether it’s a simple fix or a complete redesign, Tru-Art executes the work quickly and safely.
5. **Inspections & Clearance:** They schedule final inspections and make sure the violation is officially cleared from your record.

**Liaising with the NYC DOB**

Tru-Art speaks the language of bureaucracy. They have long-standing relationships with DOB officials and experience dealing with zoning boards, inspectors, and engineers. This inside knowledge speeds up the process, avoids missteps, and ensures your case is handled professionally from day one.

They also provide all the necessary paperwork—engineering reports, diagrams, affidavits—to document the fix and satisfy city requirements.

**Permit Expediting and Filing**

**Fast-Tracking Approvals**

Navigating the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) can feel like running a bureaucratic marathon—but Tru-Art Sign Co. is your shortcut. With years of experience and strong connections within city departments, they specialize in expediting the permit process, turning weeks of waiting into just days where possible.

From completing accurate filings to submitting architectural drawings and engineering reports, Tru-Art ensures that every document is compliant, professional, and submitted properly the first time. They know what the DOB looks for and avoid common red flags that delay approval.

Whether you’re correcting a violation or applying for a new sign permit, their team manages the entire process, including:

* Certificate of Correction submissions
* Landmark Preservation Commission filings
* Community Board approvals (where required)
* Building and zoning code analysis

**Documentation & Plans**

One of the most important parts of the permitting process is having a detailed and DOB-compliant plan set. Tru-Art collaborates with licensed engineers and architects to produce high-quality drawings and specifications. This includes sign dimensions, materials, lighting methods, mounting hardware, and structural integrity reports.

Having clean, well-organized documentation not only speeds up approvals but also ensures you stay clear of future violations.

**Corrective Construction and Repairs**

**Bringing Signs into Compliance**

Once the paperwork is approved, the next step is physical correction. Tru-Art has a full team of certified installers, technicians, and fabricators who can make whatever changes are needed to bring your signage into full compliance. Whether that means resizing, relocating, or replacing parts of the sign—or the whole thing—they get it done quickly and correctly.

Corrective construction might include:

* Adjusting the height or position of a sign
* Removing unauthorized lighting components
* Reinforcing or anchoring hardware
* Repairing damage caused by improper installation

They always use materials that meet current building and fire safety codes, ensuring your new signage passes final inspection with no issues.

**Ensuring Safety and Code Standards**

In NYC, public safety is a top priority, especially in high-foot-traffic areas. Tru-Art adheres to OSHA guidelines, electrical codes, and DOB regulations during every stage of the repair process. This not only satisfies the city—it protects your customers and your business from potential liabilities.

They also provide post-installation inspections, load tests (when required), and documentation packages so you have proof of compliance if requested by DOB officials in the future.

**Custom Sign Replacement Services**

**Designing New, Code-Compliant Signs**

Sometimes, the only way to resolve a sign violation is to remove the existing sign and start fresh. Tru-Art offers complete custom sign design services that not only resolve violations but also improve your branding in the process.

They don't just slap up a sign that meets code—they work with you to design something beautiful, functional, and on-brand. Their creative team delivers:

* 3D renderings and mockups
* ADA-compliant designs
* Neighborhood-style-consistent visuals
* High-contrast readability

Every new sign is designed with DOB approval in mind from the start, which eliminates future headaches and potential violations.

**Upgrading While Fixing**

Violation removal is also a great opportunity to upgrade. Why not turn a problem into a branding win? Tru-Art clients often take this chance to:

* Refresh outdated or worn signage
* Add new lighting features
* Improve visibility and readability
* Rebrand entirely

Tru-Art helps you think strategically, so you walk away with more than just a fixed problem—you get a major business boost.

**Understanding DOB ECB/OATH Summonses**

**What They Are**

When the NYC DOB issues a sign violation, it’s often accompanied by a summons to the Environmental Control Board (ECB), now known as the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). This legal notice requires you to either fix the issue by a certain deadline or appear in court to defend your case.

Failure to comply can result in default judgments, increased fines, and additional penalties—sometimes even court-ordered sign removals. These summonses are serious and require professional handling.

**How Tru-Art Resolves Them**

Tru-Art has extensive experience resolving ECB/OATH violations quickly and legally. They handle:

* Submitting Certificates of Correction
* Coordinating with legal counsel if needed
* Providing engineering affidavits or visual evidence
* Ensuring the violation is marked ""complied"" in the city database

Once corrected, they follow through until the violation is officially closed. This avoids lingering issues that can interfere with loans, lease renewals, or property sales.

**Working Within Landmark Districts**

**Navigating Landmark Preservation Commission Rules**

NYC is home to hundreds of designated historic districts, and signage regulations in these areas are even stricter. You can't just throw up a neon sign on a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights or install aluminum letters in SoHo without LPC (Landmarks Preservation Commission) approval.

Tru-Art specializes in creating signs that comply with LPC guidelines while still maintaining brand integrity. They know how to:

* Submit landmark-specific design proposals
* Use approved materials and construction methods
* Retain architectural aesthetics of historical buildings

**Historic Sign Compatibility**

Instead of clashing with the surrounding architecture, Tru-Art designs signs that blend beautifully with historic facades. Think hand-painted signs, gold leaf lettering, cast bronze plaques, or weathered wood textures—classic styles that get approval and admiration.

Whether you're restoring a vintage sign or installing a new one in a protected district, Tru-Art ensures it’s done right.

**Why Choose Tru-Art for Violation Removal**

**Experience and NYC Expertise**

[**Tru-Art Sign Co**](https://www.truartsignco.com/long-island-ny/). has been serving the New York City business community for decades, and they’ve seen it all—from minor decal violations to full-blown sign overhauls due to outdated structures. Their deep understanding of NYC’s ever-evolving signage laws gives them a clear edge over generic sign companies.

They’re not just technicians—they’re compliance strategists, city liaisons, and creative problem solvers. Every member of their team is trained to handle DOB filings, interpret zoning code, and execute installation or removal work with speed and precision.

Because they specialize in violation removal, their process is laser-focused on efficiency. They know which departments to contact, how to streamline corrections, and—most importantly—how to make violations go away without disrupting your business.

**Full-Service from Start to Finish**

Most companies will either fix the sign or file the paperwork—but rarely both. Tru-Art is a one-stop shop. From the moment you receive a violation, they handle everything:

* Site inspection
* Legal compliance check
* Plan preparation
* Permit filing
* Violation correction or full sign replacement
* Final inspection and clearance

Their holistic approach means you won’t waste time coordinating multiple vendors or learning complex DOB terminology. You focus on your business—they’ll handle the city.

**Case Studies: Successful Violation Removals**

**Small Businesses**

**Example: Harlem Coffee Shop**

A trendy café in Harlem received a violation for having an over-sized, non-permitted LED sign installed by a freelance contractor. Tru-Art came in, removed the existing sign, designed a new storefront sign that complied with size restrictions, filed all necessary DOB permits, and completed installation in under three weeks. The café never had to close, and their new sign actually attracted more foot traffic.

**Result:** Violation cleared, fines avoided, brand visibility improved.

**Commercial Properties**

**Example: Midtown Office Building**

A commercial landlord received multiple violations across tenants for non-uniform, outdated signage in a Class A building. Tru-Art developed a signage master plan that aligned all signs with building code and tenant brand guidelines. They replaced 12 signs across multiple floors, coordinated with the DOB and LPC (since the building was landmarked), and had all ECB violations dismissed.

**Result:** Property value increased, building aesthetics improved, and no outstanding violations on record.

These real-world results are why Tru-Art is trusted by everyone from mom-and-pop shops to real estate investment firms.

**Avoiding Future Violations**

**Regular Maintenance**

Once your violation is cleared, Tru-Art doesn’t just disappear. They offer regular maintenance packages to inspect, clean, and repair your signage before issues arise. Routine maintenance catches problems early, such as:

* Fading or cracking materials
* Electrical issues in illuminated signs
* Structural wear and tear

This proactive approach prevents violations, extends the life of your sign, and saves money in the long run.

**Pre-Install Compliance Checks**

Before designing or installing any new signage, Tru-Art performs a full zoning and compliance check to make sure your sign is 100% legal. That includes analyzing:

* Square footage limitations
* Lighting regulations
* Height and distance from street level
* Landmark district restrictions

Think of it as a “compliance audit” for your signage plans. It’s how Tru-Art ensures your sign not only looks great but never triggers a surprise visit from the DOB.

**Cost of Violation Removal in NYC**

**Factors That Affect Price**

Violation removal costs vary based on several key factors:

* Severity of the violation
* Type of sign involved (illuminated, channel letter, vinyl, etc.)
* Location and accessibility
* Whether the sign needs full replacement
* DOB filing and permit fees

Most projects range from **$1,500 to $10,000**, depending on complexity.

**How Tru-Art Helps You Save**

While violation removal isn’t cheap, Tru-Art saves you money by:

* Preventing additional fines and legal fees
* Speeding up resolution so you can stay open
* Offering bundled services (design, install, permit) under one roof
* Avoiding costly mistakes that unlicensed contractors often make

They also offer flexible payment plans for qualified clients and transparent pricing up front—no hidden fees.

**FAQs**

**1. What is a DOB sign violation in NYC?**

A DOB (Department of Buildings) violation is issued when signage is installed or maintained in a way that violates NYC building or zoning codes. This can include size, lighting, placement, or lack of permits.

**2. How much does it cost to remove a sign violation in NYC?**

The cost typically ranges from $1,500 to $10,000, depending on severity, scope of work, and whether the sign must be replaced or repaired.

**3. Can I fix the sign violation myself?**

It's not recommended. DIY fixes may not meet code, and you could face further fines. Always work with a licensed, experienced professional like Tru-Art to ensure proper compliance.

**4. How long does it take to resolve a sign violation?**

Most violations can be resolved within 2 to 6 weeks, depending on how quickly permits are processed and the complexity of the work involved.

Absolutely. Tru-Art handles all DOB filings, drawings, permits, and inspections, guiding you through the entire violation removal process from start to finish.",1,1754536805.0,signawning,0,1.0,False

1mjp93q,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1mjp93q/foreigners_getting_married_in_japan_heres_what/,Foreigners getting married in Japan? Here’s what actually works (photographer’s 2025 guide),"**My background and experience with this**

I’m James, a UK-born photographer now based in Australia, and Japan is one of my busiest destinations. In the past few seasons I’ve helped couples file paperwork in Tokyo ward offices, organised Shinto blessings in Kyoto shrines, planned symbolic mountaintop vows in Nagano and shot partnership-certificate ceremonies for LGBTQIA+ pairs in Osaka. After watching so many people wrestle with conflicting internet advice, I wrote down the clear, current process I give my clients so they can focus on ramen rather than red tape.

**Choose your legal route**

Start by deciding which of four paths fits you. Two non-Japanese partners can register a marriage entirely in Japan by handing in a kon’in todoke at any city or ward office; once the clerk stamps it the marriage is fully recognised under Japanese law. A mixed couple, where one partner is Japanese, uses the same form but must add a freshly issued copy of the Japanese partner’s family register - the koseki tohon - plus photo ID. Same-sex couples cannot obtain a nationwide marriage yet, but more than fifty municipalities issue partnership certificates that unlock rights such as joint tenancy and hospital visitation; most pairs back that up with a legal ceremony in their home country, so the status travels internationally. Many couples skip overseas bureaucracy completely and come to Japan for a purely symbolic celebration - shrine ritual, alpine lake vows or neon rooftop vows - while handling legal paperwork at home.

**The paperwork you carry**

For the fully legal routes each partner needs a passport and photocopy, a Certificate of No Impediment (sometimes called a single-status affidavit) dated within the past three months and, even if the clerk claims it is optional, a birth certificate because requirements change by ward. Every non-Japanese document must be translated into Japanese, yet self-translation is acceptable if each page is signed and dated. Two adult witnesses aged twenty or older must appear with ID; they can be friends, vendors or the friendly traveller you met in the hostel lounge. If one partner is Japanese that fresh koseki tohon is mandatory. Scanning everything to cloud storage before you fly means a lost suitcase cannot wreck the day.

**Filling in the kon’in todoke**

Download the bilingual PDF, print it and fill it out over hotel coffee instead of hunching at the public counter. Names go in block capitals with a katakana version underneath - clerks genuinely appreciate the clarity. Japanese forms list the surname first, so double-check every field before you put pen to paper.

**What happens at the counter**

On filing day, walk to the family-register window marked koseki-ka, hand over passports, translations, witness IDs and the completed form, then wait while the clerk flips through the bundle. If everything is correct, you usually hear the approval stamp within ten to thirty minutes. Certified copies of your Japanese marriage certificate cost only loose change, so buy at least two. Before leaving ask for the Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Marriage because banks, immigration officers and name-change offices care far more about that plain sheet than the decorative parchment you will frame later. By the time you reach the nearest ramen shop you are legally married.

**Making the marriage portable**

Once you have the certificate, translate at least one copy back into English if your home country needs it, then legalise another copy with an apostille at your embassy in Tokyo or via courier while you honeymoon elsewhere. Most embassies stamp documents the same day if you arrive early. When you get home lodge the apostilled certificate with local authorities so the marriage is recognised everywhere from immigration to banks.

**A calm timeline**

Roughly four months before departure order the Certificate of No Impediment and check embassy opening hours so you don’t arrive during a public holiday. Two months out finish translations, download the kon’in todoke and confirm witnesses. One month before the trip print everything twice and ensure nothing has expired. During the week of filing scout photo locations and make sure the city hall is not closing for a festival - Golden Week from 29 April to 5 May catches a lot of couples. On the day itself half an hour at the counter is usually all it takes.

**What it really costs in 2025**

Submitting the kon’in todoke is free. Two certified copies run about seven hundred yen total. An apostille at the UK embassy sits just over seven thousand yen. A traditional Shinto ceremony with kimono rental averages around one hundred thousand yen, while a popular garden photo permit sits near ten thousand yen. Even after adding flights many couples spend less than they would on a registry-office ceremony and pub lunch back home.

**Picking the right season**

Late March to early April brings the iconic cherry blossoms, but tourist spots are crowded and dawn shoots are common. May and early June offer lush greenery, moderate prices and only the first hints of rainy season toward the end of June. Mid-October through late November lights up with red maples and comfortable temperatures, although local couples love autumn too so venues book quickly. December to February means crystal skies, snow-capped Fuji views and very short daylight; hand-warmers and early ceremony slots are essential.

**Field-tested hacks from the job**

Print two sets of every document because public copiers accept only ten-yen coins and jam at the worst moment. Pick up clear bubble umbrellas at Daiso for three hundred yen so drizzle won’t ruin photos. Slip chemical heat packs into kimono obi or suit pockets for winter shoots. Keep a roll of double-sided kimono tape on hand; it fixes everything from rogue lapels to bouquet ribbons.

I keep a printable checklist, translation templates and a shortlist of ceremony spots in my profile if you want extra detail, but the essentials are all here. Happy planning, and feel free to drop questions below - I’ll help where I can.",5,1754536765.0,JapanTravelTips,1,0.86,False
1mjp7xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dubaiwiki/comments/1mjp7xu/exploring_the_vibrant_majlis_culture_of_the_uae/,Exploring the Vibrant Majlis Culture of the UAE," In the heart of the United Arab Emirates,where tradition meets modernity, lies a cultural gem that has fostered community, hospitality, and connection for centuries: the majlis. This cherished institution is more than just a physical space—it’s a vibrant expression of Emirati heritage, a hub for social interaction, and a symbol of the UAE’s deep-rooted values of generosity and togetherness. Let’s dive into the world of the majlis and discover why it remains a cornerstone of Emirati life.
What is a Majlis?
The word ""majlis"" translates to ""a place of sitting"" in Arabic, and it perfectly captures the essence of this cultural practice. A majlis is a designated room or area, often in an Emirati home or community space, where people gather to discuss matters of importance, share stories, or simply enjoy each other’s company. Traditionally, it’s a space where hospitality reigns supreme, and guests are treated with warmth, respect, and an abundance of refreshments.
From the outside, a majlis might appear as a simple room adorned with plush cushions, intricate carpets, and low seating arrangements, but its significance runs much deeper. It’s a space where hierarchies blur, voices are heard, and bonds are strengthened—whether among family, friends, or even strangers.
A Historical Anchor
The majlis has its roots in Bedouin traditions, where tribal leaders would host gatherings to resolve disputes, share news, or welcome travelers. In a desert environment where survival depended on community, the majlis was a vital institution for fostering unity and mutual support. Over time, as the UAE transformed into a modern nation, the majlis evolved while retaining its core purpose: to bring people together.
Today, majlis culture is as relevant as ever. In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, you’ll find both traditional majlises in homes and modern iterations in public spaces, such as cultural centers or even hotels, where the spirit of the majlis is preserved for locals and visitors alike.
The Anatomy of a Majlis
Step into a majlis, and you’ll immediately feel the warmth of Emirati hospitality. The setup is designed for comfort and connection. Low, cushioned seating lines the walls, encouraging face-to-face interaction. Intricate rugs and traditional decorations, such as lanterns or calligraphy, create an inviting ambiance. The air is often scented with oud, a fragrant incense that adds to the sensory experience.
No majlis is complete without an array of refreshments. Guests are greeted with gahwa (Arabic coffee), served in small handleless cups, accompanied by dates or sweets. The act of pouring and sharing coffee is a ritual in itself, symbolizing respect and welcome. Depending on the occasion, you might also enjoy luqaimat (sweet dumplings), fresh fruits, or other traditional delicacies.
A Space for Connection
The majlis is more than a physical space—it’s a social institution that reflects the UAE’s values of inclusivity and generosity. It’s where families gather to celebrate milestones, where neighbors resolve disputes, and where strangers become friends. In a majlis, everyone is equal, and every voice matters. Whether it’s a casual catch-up or a serious discussion about community matters, the majlis fosters open dialogue and mutual respect.
For Emiratis, the majlis is also a space to preserve traditions. Elders share stories of the past, passing down wisdom to younger generations. Poetry recitals, known as nabati, are a common feature, celebrating the UAE’s rich literary heritage. During Ramadan, majlises take on an even more special role, hosting iftar gatherings where families and friends break their fast together, reinforcing the sense of community.
The Modern Majlis
While rooted in tradition, the majlis has adapted to the UAE’s cosmopolitan present. Today, you’ll find majlises in various forms—some are private, hosted in homes, while others are public, organized by cultural institutions or government bodies to promote dialogue and cultural exchange. For example, the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in Dubai hosts open majlises where visitors can engage with Emirati hosts, ask questions, and learn about local customs over coffee and dates.
The majlis has also inspired modern design trends. Many UAE homes now feature contemporary majlis rooms with sleek furniture and cutting-edge technology, blending tradition with luxury. Even in corporate settings, businesses have embraced the majlis concept, creating meeting spaces that echo its spirit of collaboration and hospitality.
Why the Majlis Matters
In a fast-paced world dominated by digital communication, the majlis stands as a reminder of the power of face-to-face connection. It’s a space where time slows down, where people listen to one another, and where hospitality is an art form. For Emiratis, the majlis is a living tradition that bridges the past and the present, ensuring that the values of community and generosity remain at the heart of UAE society.
For visitors, experiencing a majlis is a window into the soul of the UAE. It’s a chance to witness the warmth and openness that define Emirati culture. Whether you’re sipping gahwa in a traditional home or attending a cultural majlis in a bustling city, you’re participating in a timeless ritual that celebrates human connection.
Conclusion
The majlis is more than a room—it’s a heartbeat of Emirati culture, pulsating with stories, laughter, and shared moments. It’s where the UAE’s past and present converge, where strangers become friends, and where the simple act of sitting together becomes a profound expression of unity. So, the next time you’re in the UAE, seek out a majlis, sip some gahwa, and immerse yourself in the vibrant culture that makes this nation so unique. You’ll leave not just with a full stomach but with a fuller heart.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Seattle Mariners vs. Chicago White Sox: A Tale of Two Teams (and One Very Tired Pitcher)**  
The Seattle Mariners, fresh off their 61-53 résumé, host the Chicago White Sox (42-71), a team that’s playing baseball like it’s a game of “how many losses can we stack before the clock strikes midnight?” First pitch is 9:40 p.m. ET at T-Mobile Park, where the Mariners’ offense is as reliable as a Seattle drizzle in March—ubiquitous, and best avoided if you’re a White Sox pitcher.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Mariners Are the Favorite

The Mariners (-1.5 runs, 1.34 decimal odds) are the clear chalk here, with an implied probability of **74.6%** to win. The White Sox (+1.5, 3.35 odds) have a laughably low **29.9%** chance, which is about the same odds of me explaining the plot of *The Room* without making a face. Statistically, this is a mismatch. Seattle’s 8.5-run differential (61-53 vs. 42-71) is like a heavyweight champion facing a sumo wrestler who’s trying to diet.

On the mound, George Kirby (6-5, 4.12 ERA) seeks his 13th straight start of five or more innings. His 9.3 strikeouts per nine innings are sharper than a Seattle knife at a rain-soaked Mariners game. Meanwhile, Jonathan Cannon (4-8, 4.77 ERA) brings a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 2.34, which is less “dominant” and more “why is this pitcher’s name a brand of weak coffee?” Cannon’s ERA is 0.65 worse than Kirby’s, and his control? Well, if walking batters were Olympic sport, he’d be a gold medalist.

### News Digest: Injuries, Struggles, and Why the White Sox Should Pack a Towel

The Mariners’ key hitters—Cal Raleigh (42 HRs, 88 RBIs), Eugenio Suarez (.243 AVG), and Josh Naylor (.284 AVG)—are as reliable as a coffee shop in downtown Seattle. No major injuries here, just a team clicking like a well-oiled espresso machine.

The White Sox? They’re the baseball equivalent of a group text that’s 90

Central City was never quiet for long.

Wally West raced down 110th Avenue, a streak of red and silver against the city blur. Sparks danced from his boots. The insignia on his chest - white lightning over crimson - gleamed in the daylight.

He spun past a collapsing building facade, weaving through falling bricks at inhuman pace. His eyes locked on the nearest threat - the next of many chrome, sword-wielding warriors to take down. The Samuroid’s robotic arm was outstretched, its humming katana blade thrusted toward a mother shielding her son.

“Not today,” Wally muttered.

He surged forward, planted one foot on a fire hydrant, flipped skyward with enough torque to bend the air, and ricocheted off a lamppost, accelerating with keen precision. He struck the Samuroid full-force in the chest. Sparks burst from its chest as it crashed backward, sword clanging to the street.

Wally grinned to himself as the civilians scarpered to safety. ""No problem.”

Then another Samuroid rose behind him - until a silver blur sliced clean through it.

“Zoom,” Wally said, catching his breath.

William West stood in the smoking remains, brushing dust off his shoulder like it bored him. “Flash,” he smirked in return.

“I had it handled,” Wally shook his head with a chuckle, watching the two civilians rush off to safety.

“Yeah, well,” William smirked, as he looked out to the dozen other Samurai androids striding forth ominously. “We were in the area.”

Icy wind curled down from above. Captain Cold slid down an icy ramp of his own creation, carrying him from atop the opposite building to the street. His hands exuded frosty air, his powers good for much more than a dramatic entrance. “Miss us?”

A single fireball burst forth from a nearby alley, striking one android in the chest. Heat Wave followed closely behind, ready to fling plenty more.

Then the sky darkened. A fierce tempest struck the square, prompting the Samuroids to dig in to keep their footing, their gyroscopes working overtime all at once. On the opposite side of the Samuroids appeared Weather Wizard, her every movement controlling the winds.

New Rogues approached the small army of Samuroids in lockstep, daring them to strike. Wally couldn’t help the grin creeping onto his face.

William shot him a look. “Take off, Flash. We’ve got this handled.”

Wally hesitated.

“You’ve got somewhere to be,” William added. “I’ll swing by when we’re done.”

Wally watched the scene unfold before him: Samuroids clashed with flame and ice, with wind and lightning. The fight was far from done, but his home had more than enough champions dedicated to its protection.

He took a breath, and then he ran.

Wally stepped through the door of his apartment, a faint electric hum trailing behind him, his costume dissolving into the ether just as quickly as he was able to summon it. The familiar scent of melted cheese and garlic hit him instantly. His shoulders dropped, tension bleeding away.

“Sorry I’m late, work was…” he called, already shrugging off his coat and letting it fall over the hook by the door.

*Chaos*, he finished silently. The streets had been crawling with Samuroids. But taking them down was hardly an issue. In the 25th century, taking on the role of the Flash was nothing more than an obligation, something he did because the world didn’t have anyone else. Something he never felt like he deserved. This, he dared to think, was different. It was fulfilling in a way the future had never been. That had been about getting by, surviving, and preventing catastrophe. This was about doing what he was born to do, in the place he was meant to be. Saving people. Making a difference. Making Barry proud.

He rounded the corner and stopped. His humble apartment was far fuller than he expected. Pizza boxes sprawled across the dining table, half-eaten slices already vanishing into a crowd of familiar faces. His aunt Iris waved him in from the far end, a six-month-old Jacob bouncing on her lap as Patty fussed with a sippy cup. Tina McGee raised her bottle of soda in greeting. His great-uncle Joe was leaning against the far wall, laughing at something the teenaged Bart had just said. And sitting at the edge of the couch was something he hadn’t seen in years.

“Avery!” Wally’s eyes lit up as he crossed the room and pulled her into a hug. “It’s so great to see you!”

“It’s been too long,” she grinned, hugging him back tightly.

“How’s it going in China?” he asked.

“Put it this way: I’m keeping my cell close in case anyone calls. One speedster for a whole country is one hell of a job.”

Wally laughed, stepping back.

Avery gestured around the room. “I wouldn’t miss today. Not for anything.” Her voice dipped slightly. “He was a hard-ass. But… well, he was a hero. To all of us.”

Everyone nodded. A gentle, solemn silence followed. Six months without Barry. And, as much as they all rallied together, it didn’t dull the ache they all felt as they mourned him.

Wally took a seat beside Bart and Tina, glancing toward the door. “William’s en route. Got held up.”

Patty chuckled from across the room. “You’re both just like Barry.”

Wally raised an eyebrow. “Late?”

That got a full laugh from the room. Even baby Jacob squealed.

Joe stepped forward, clapping Bart on the shoulder. “Hey, kid. You got the Nintendo set up?”

Bart spun around, already holding out a controller. “Mario Kart good for you?”

Joe grinned. “You’re on.”

William arrived within the hour, the Samuroids all defeated. It wasn’t long until he was having an overdue conversation with Avery, trying to keep things light, both a little stiff in their body language but determined to catch up on what they had missed in each other’s lives. On the sofa, Patty and Bart wrestled with an unopened bottle of white wine, both red-faced from the effort and determined to open it without their powers. Dr McGee gently rocked baby Jacob in her arms, whispering softly to him as if he might understand. The coffee table was crowded with paper plates, pizza crusts, and soda cans, while the air hummed with the low static of good company.

Wally stood apart, half-shadowed by the window, his eyes trained on the endless trail of traffic winding through Central City. The cars didn’t stop. Not really. One stream slowed down, another picked up. The lights changed, the honking started again. It never ended. In Blue Valley, Nebraska, home had moved at a slower pace, but Wally had been trapped in an agonisingly slow existence enough for one lifetime already.

“Six months as the Flash,” Iris said gently as she came up beside him. “How you holding up?”

Wally didn’t look away from the street. “Well, I’m meeting up with Hartley this weekend,” he said. “Only a few months left on my engineering course, and I'm looking to trade this place for a bigger apartment at the end of the month.”

Iris chuckled. “I did mean fighting crime, stopping bad guys, saving people.”

Wally smiled faintly. “I’m faster than could possibly make sense,” he said. “Saving people is the easy part.”

“Barry said the same.” Her smile dimmed. They were fond memories, but painful ones. “Have you gone to see him today?”

“At the cemetery?"" Wally glanced at her, then back to the street. “No. I told you, he’s not there.”

“I know he’s isn't but… well, neither was his dad Jay, but Barry visited his grave. Said it made him feel close to him.”

Wally’s breath caught slightly. The city was loud, alive, relentless, but inside him was a small, quiet hum - a spark, a pulse. “I do feel close to him,” he said. “No matter where I am.”

Iris reached over, squeezed his arm. Her hand was warm, her smile tremulous. They stood together in silence, the crowd behind them fading into a distant murmur.

Then, after a long beat, she said what she had been afraid to say. “Have you wondered why we’re still here?”

Wally turned to her, frowning. “What do you mean?”

“I mean… after everything. The Reverse Flash’s experiment. The timeline changes. Why haven’t we been erased?”

Before he could answer, the sky outside cracked open.

A crack of lightning, sharp and sudden, without any overture of warning. It struck the middle of the street, like the gods had thrown a match.

Wally’s eyes snapped wide. The road outside was packed with cars, horns already starting to blare. Without a word, he vanished, a red-silver blur leaving Iris behind as the curtains fluttered in the vacuum of his wake.

On the scene in less than a second, five streaks of lightning tore down the block - red, silver, gold, violet, and blue. Wally, William, Bart, Avery, and Patty each peeled people from their cars with flawless synchronicity, sweeping pedestrians off the sidewalk, pulling drivers from seatbelts, catching a toddler mid-fall as a panicked father tripped over the kerb.

Seconds later, the lightning-struck car exploded into a rolling fireball.

The speedsters kept moving, a cyclone of colour carving through the chaos. They moved people two, three blocks away, past the bakeries and barbershops, and didn’t stop until they were sure the blast radius was empty. Wally was the first to circle back.

The flames had spread, leaping from car to car. Wally straightened his back and whipped his arms into tight, controlled circles, forming twin vortexes that snuffed the blaze car by car. In seconds, the block was quiet again, albeit scorched.

Then came Patty’s voice. “Wally!” she cried out.

He spun around. “What—?”

He saw her standing frozen, her eyes locked on the wreckage. On the roof of the car where the lightning had struck.

Wally followed her gaze.

A figure stood atop the twisted metal, unmoving but blurred, vibrating so fast he was little more than a silhouette, his entire frame haloed in electricity. White lightning crawled across his skin. Wally couldn’t make out the face, not at first.

Then the man slowed. His molecules settled. The blurring faded away.

It was Barry.

In plain clothes. No suit. No mask. No warning.

Patty gasped, then ran. “Barry!” she screamed. She launched herself into his arms, clutching him like she was afraid he’d vanish if she blinked. Her sobs shook her whole body.

Wally couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

In the doorway of the apartment, Dr McGee’s hand flew to her mouth. Joe staggered forward in disbelief. Iris cast a look down at baby Jacob in her arms and then back up at the man she thought she’d never see again.

“Here,” Barry whispered to Patty, gently guiding her down from the car. “Come on. Let’s get away from this.” His voice was soft.

He stepped down from the wreckage and gestured toward Wally’s window. “Let’s go inside.”


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;


The apartment was so quiet you could hear the hum of the refrigerator. Everyone sat on the edge of their seats. Even little Jacob had gone quiet in Patty’s arms, entranced by the strange energy of the room.

Barry sat on the couch, visibly exhausted but calm, a glass of water in his hand. Wally stood nearby, arms crossed, still half unsure this was real.

“I don’t know how to explain it,” Barry began. “When I ran into the rift… I expected to die. I felt myself coming apart, *atom by atom*, until there was no me anymore.”

Patty clutched her baby son closer.

“But then I was somewhere else,” Barry continued. “Alive. Whole. Standing in a city I didn’t recognise. No wreckage, no pain, just… strange buildings and people with technology I couldn’t understand.”

William frowned. “The future?”

Barry nodded. “The 31st century.”

There were stunned looks all around. William carried on. “But… you had to give yourself to the Speed Force to stabilise the explosion.”

“I did,” Barry said. “I felt it happen. I became one with the Speed Force. In an instant, I saw things I can’t even describe - the history of the multiverse playing out like film reels around me. I saw Dad. And Max.”

He smirked faintly. “But then… something strange happened. I was stable. At peace. And then I wasn’t. It was like I slipped through a crack in the Speed Force itself. Like I was out of phase with reality. And when I came to… I was in the 31st century.”

A light went on in Wally’s eyes.

“*108 kilohertz*,” he said.

Barry blinked. “What?”

“*The difference between riding the Speed Force home and being torn atom from atom*,” Wally murmured, half quoting Professor Thawne. “It worked.”

“You did this?” Barry went quiet as he remembered his final exchange with Wally, and the spark that moved between them.

Patty turned to Wally too, the breath almost beaten out of her by shock. “I think he did.”

Without another word, Barry stood and threw his arms around Wally, gripping him tight. “Thank you,” he said. “Thank you for bringing me home.”

The whole room didn’t dare to breathe. Then Patty’s voice came, gentle but certain. “The Reverse Flash said Wally almost never survived his journey to the future and back.”

Barry stepped back, meeting her eyes. “That was the variable,” he said. “This time around, everything worked out.”

He looked back to Wally, beaming. “Because you lived.”

Wally, flustered, held up his hands. “We all did our part.”

But Barry was already shaking his head. “Maybe so,” he said. “But you brought me back home.”


&nbsp;

🔻🔺 ⚡ 🔺🔻

&nbsp;



By eleven o’ clock, only four remained in the apartment: Wally, Barry, Patty, and baby Jacob, who lay nestled against his mother’s chest, his little hand batting the air.

“Six months…” Barry said softly, his eyes unfocused. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come back to the moment I left. I just leapt at the first chance I got to get home.”

“We’re just glad you’re back,” Patty said softly. She looked drained, but joy radiated beneath the fatigue. Jacob cooed, clutching Barry’s finger with surprising strength.

Barry smiled, letting that tiny grip ground him. “I missed this. Missed him.” He glanced to Patty, then Wally. “Missed all of you.” Barry’s heart melted as his eyes met his son’s again for the first time in a long time, knowing he had Jacob’s whole life to make up for the six months he had missed. 

“How did you get back?” Wally asked from the arm of the couch, where he sat sideways, shoulders loose.

“I found him,” Barry said, beaming now. “The future Bart. He ended up in the same time period as me. I was stuck as long as I was because I burned out most of my speed feeding the Speed Force, balancing it out. Eventually, I was strong enough for Bart to give me enough of his to make the trip back.”

“And he’s okay?” Patty asked quickly, her voice hitching.

“More than okay,” Barry said. “He’s got a world to protect. A family. Don’t forget, he was already an old man when I met him in 2019.”

Wally hesitated. A question had haunted him for most of the evening, something he felt guilty for even considering in light of everything. But it was too important to him for him to keep it to himself.

“So… what happens now?” he finally asked.

Barry turned his head slightly. “What do you mean?”

“Well, we’ve got by for the last six months, but you’re back now.” Wally gave a forced, half-nervous smile. “Don’t you want to… you know?”

Barry’s expression softened. “After what the Speed Force took from me, you’re faster than me now, Wally,” he said. “Hell, you might be faster than I ever was, outside of the EMP supercharge. And besides…” he beamed with pride. “It’s like I said inside the particle accelerator. It’s your turn now.”

Wally stared at the floor, overwhelmed. Then he nodded, a slow breath leaving him like a weight lifting from his chest. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

Barry leaned back. “But hey - if it ever gets to be too much, just say the word. I’ll step in. Give you a break.” He looked over to Patty and then back down at the baby in her arms. “But in the meantime, I’ve got a baby to raise.”

He leaned forward, took a deep breath, and promptly recoiled, gagging. “And a diaper to change!”

They all laughed, the sound warm and weary at the end of a long day.

Barry stood, lifting Jacob from Patty’s arms as the baby giggled, babbling nonsense to the ceiling. Wally watched them from the sofa, arms crossed loosely, lightning still tingling faintly in his fingertips. The love that Barry and Patty had for him was immense, like nothing he had known growing up. And there was plenty more from everyone else - chief among them, William and Iris. He couldn’t forget the future either, with Rosie, Jai and Eobard just waiting for him to visit, which he knew he would one day, when he was fast enough.

Once, Wally was a lonely kid who could only dream of going on adventures like his childhood hero. Then he was a time-displaced teen with his whole life snatched away from him. He had survived a difficult childhood, and a tumultuous adolescence that had stretched across centuries. And now, with his hero’s approval, and his own hard-earned self-confidence, he knew his greatest adventures were ahead of him.

Wally looked forward to the future with excitement, ready to weather any storm the universe would throw his way.

Now, he was the Flash.

The Fastest Man Alive.

But the best part?

He would never have to run alone.

1mjp221,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjp221,Cafe Loft x Gute Leute coffee omakase,"
I got to experience this limited omakase tasting in LA. I reside in Germany most of the year, so I feel very fortunate to have been able to experience this. I didn’t take any photos myself, so I’m using photos from Cafe Loft’s instagram account. I’m not affiliated with them, though I am friends with the owner of Cafe Loft.

I’m normally a plain espresso drinker. Sometimes a long black, very seldom a latte. I saw on their instagram that they were doing this special event while I happened to be in town, so I reserved a spot. It only runs until this Friday, but if you’re in LA, there might still be some spots left.

The omakase is a collaboration between Cafe Loft and Gute Leute. Loft is in LA and GL is based in Seoul, Korea. 

It was a series of drinks that go well with the summer heat. The drinks being a fusion of coffee and Korean culture. 

The first was a palette cleaner. The only drink that wasn’t coffee based. It was a semi sweet Asian pear drink, infused with rosemary. Refreshing and delicious.

Second was a mildly sweetened espresso with pop candies on the side. The espresso was sweetened just enough for it to taste richer, but not so sweet, that I actually had to ask if they added sugar. It was perfect. I was instructed to first drink the espresso by itself, and then try it with the pop rocks. The combination was surprisingly pleasant. This is something you can easily try at home.

Third was a mugwort/coconut cream drink. I’ve known about this he existence of mugwort, as it’s used in Korean rice cakes, but I never knew what it was called in English. The drink without coffee was good, but once you mix a shot of espresso in there, it becomes a really interesting coffee drink. I’ve never thought that the combination of mugwort and coffee would be good, but this drink came together really well. And it was my favorite of the five. Unfortunately, I don’t think this is a drink I could replicate at home. 

Fourth was frozen espresso topped with vegan cream and dried strawberries, with a little bit of thyme (I believe it was). I first chewed on the thyme, then had the strawberry and cream, then tried it all together as instructed. I think the thyme was to cleanse the palette between this and the previous drink as the previous drink was slightly sweet. This is one that would make an interesting desert. 

The last was a mix of coffee and a traditional Korean drink. The visuals on this one was stunning, as they light up the outside. They also burn a bit of cinnamon on the inside to create an aroma. The traditional Korean drink (I forget what it’s called, as I don’t normally drink it. But it’s a sweet ginger cinnamon tea. The aroma, the flavors of the tea mixed with coffee just fused perfectly together. It was delicious, and I’m going to have to learn how to make that tea at home to try to replicate the drink.

The good folks at Gute Leute also hooked me up with some beans and cold brew, because they heard I have a decent espresso machine back in Germany. If I’m ever in Korea, I’m definitely going to check them out. Their creativity really blew my mind. If you’re in Seoul, or ever visiting, I highly recommend them for a different kind of coffee experience.",2,1754536184.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We met through a playlist.

Not in person. Not in a coffee shop or a party or some cute-ass bookstore. It was late summer and she replied to my playlist post with the caption, “Tell me how it ends without telling me how it ends.”

She said, “It ends with a song you weren’t ready to hear.”

That’s how it started.

She lived hours away. Different cities. Different rhythms. Different kinds of lonely. But something about her felt like a glitch in the system. Like the algorithm brought me someone who spoke in soft chaos. Someone whose silence wasn’t empty, just sacred.

Let’s call her Safi.
Safi was intense without trying. Private but magnetic. She’d say things like, “I don’t like being perceived,” but then look right into your soul with a single text. Her voice was low, careful, thoughtful. Like every word cost her something.

I wasn’t looking for anything serious. Not long-distance. Not a love story. I was just bored, burnt out, using music as a flotation device.

But we started texting. Then calling. Then talking for six hours straight about everything and nothing. She made me laugh in that ugly, unfiltered way. And she made me feel… safe. Like maybe I wasn’t too much. Like all the parts of me people had called dramatic or deep or exhausting were actually meant for someone like her.

We hadn’t even met in person yet.
But I was already falling.

Hard.

One night, during one of those quiet pauses, she said something that stayed with me.

“If you were here, I’d be too shy to touch you. But I’d want to. Every second.”

And I felt that everywhere. Every single place I didn’t know had been aching to be wanted.",1,1754536122.0,BasedOnATrueStory_,0,1.0,False

Yesterday was worse: I was so hungry and had no time for lunch, so when I finally got home, I ordered a whole medium vegetarian pizza and ate it all, then had a slice of maple walnut coffee cake and a cup of tea.

1mjoz5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mjoz5d/help_find_this_novel/,Help Find this Novel,"I’m supposed to be at work today, but I traded shifts with a coworker. Instead, I’m kneeling on the floor of one of the upstairs rooms, elbow deep in boxes I’ve meant to clear out for months. Sunlight slants through the window, dust swirling in the beams, and I’m humming to myself, half-lost in the rhythm of an old song looping in my head.

Then the crunch of tires on gravel cuts through my reverie. Curious, I push up onto my knees and peer through the glass. Balen’s car rolls into the driveway. My heart lifts, silly with anticipation—I’m home, unexpectedly, and maybe today he’ll actually be glad to see me. Maybe this time, he’ll want me again. It feels like forever since he last touched me with anything close to tenderness.

I’m about to step away from the window when another engine purrs up behind his. I blink, surprised. Cyrene’s car. My twin. The two of them, home together. For a brief, naive moment, I feel a childish surge of happiness. Funny, looking back, how nothing about this strikes me as odd—not then. I’m too trusting, always have been.

I linger by the window, invisible behind the curtain, watching as Balen steps out and turns toward Cyrene. He’s always kept his distance from her at family gatherings, their glances strange and unreadable, but nothing could have prepared me for what I see now. Cyrene launches herself into his arms, legs locking around his waist, and he catches her easily, kissing her with a hunger that leaves me hollowed out in an instant. A kiss so deep, so desperate, it makes my stomach drop and rage surge hot through my veins.

An affair. Of course. Is this why he hasn’t touched me in months? I choke on a sob, betrayal slicing through me, sharp and raw.

My mind scrambles for proof—anything to stop them from gaslighting me again, from twisting the story until I’m the one left doubting my own eyes. My hands fumble for my phone. I snap photos through the glass, capturing the two of them locked together, oblivious. He lifts her, her legs still cinched around his waist, carrying her toward the house, hands splayed on her thighs, her back. They don’t even try to hide.

Questions spiral: How many times have they done this? How far will they go, right here, in our home? In hindsight, the truth is obvious—they’ve been at this for a long time. But in the moment, I’m frozen, watching the lie of my life unravel with brutal clarity.

I slip from the window and crack open the upstairs door, heart pounding. Downstairs, Cyrene’s laughter rings up the stairwell, light and carefree. I pad quietly to the balcony, holding my breath, peering down at the lounge below. If I need to, I can dart into a spare room. But I need to see.

They don’t make it to the bedroom. I watch, unseen, as they tumble onto the living room floor, hands everywhere, mouths pressed together, discarding clothes in a frantic rush. My phone trembles in my hand. I flip to video, desperate to record it all before they have a chance to lie or deny. My tears smear the screen and my hands shake, but anger keeps me steady—anger at myself, at them, at years wasted on a man who never loved me at all.

Cyrene’s moans echo up the stairs. Balen is stripped down to his boxers, already on his knees between her legs, his head buried in her thighs.

He never did that for me. He always said he found it disgusting, that he couldn’t stand going down on a woman. So it was only me he found repulsive. The tears dry on my cheeks, replaced by a cold, burning fury. How long have they laughed about me behind my back? How long have I been the punchline to their secret?

I force myself to breathe, to steady my grip. I need this evidence.

“Oh, god, I am going to cum,” Cyrene cries out, voice shrill and unashamed. Balen doesn’t stop; he just kisses his way up her body, lavishing her breasts with the kind of attention he never wasted on me. His boxers hit the floor. He doesn’t bother with a condom. For me, there was always a condom—he said he wasn’t ready for kids, that neither of us was. But for her, nothing. He thrusts into her bare, and I feel sick.

They writhe together on the carpet, a mess of limbs and sweat and breathless noise. Cyrene climbs on top, riding him with wild abandon. He urges her on, voice low and eager, “Ride me, baby.” He used to complain when I tried to take control, claimed he hated it. Now, watching him with her, I realize he only ever hated it with me.

She cries out again, shuddering, and he flips her over, driving into her harder, sweat glistening down his back as he gives her everything he never offered me. Their pleasure is raw and unrestrained—nothing like the cold, mechanical sex I endured. For Balen, I was a chore, a duty. For Cyrene, he is a lover.

When he finally collapses, spent, he gathers her close, kissing her gently, murmuring in her ear. He hasn’t held me like that in years. Maybe never. Jealousy stabs at me, then drains away, leaving only emptiness. Why should I envy her, anyway? She always got everything—my toys, my clothes, my parents’ affection. Now she has my husband, too.

He strokes her hair, voice thick with longing. “Sweetheart, why won't you let me divorce Brielle and move in with you? I told you before—it was always you I wanted. Not her. You pushed me to marry her. I need you.”

My jaw clenches at the sound of my own name, at the revelation that I was never more than a consolation prize.

Cyrene laughs, rolling away from him, unashamed. “I’ve told you before—she’s loaded. I’ve burned through all my inheritance. I need you here. You don’t spend your paycheck on anyone but me, and she pays for everything else. No bills, no worries, and you get to buy me pretty things on her credit card. Why would I give up the best of both worlds? I get you and her money. Why change a good thing?”

He grins, teasing, “That’s harsh. You only want me for my money?” They both dissolve into laughter, a private joke I was never meant to hear.

Cyrene stands, slowly dressing, making a show of stretching and smoothing her clothes, as if daring me to watch.

“Baby, I have to get back to work. See you later?” She leans down, pecks him on the lips, and heads for the door.

He calls after her, “We still on for this weekend?” She pauses, tapping her finger on her lips, pretending to think.

“Of course. You told her you had a seminar, right?”

“Yeah. I’ve got a bag packed in the car. I’ll call her, say I’m leaving early, and meet you at your place.”

“Perfect,” she says, blowing him a kiss, and skips out the door, light as air.

Balen dresses quickly, tidies the lounge, sprays air freshener in wide, guilty arcs. The scent is sharp and unfamiliar—one I’ve never bought, never liked. Now the memory clicks into place. I’ve smelled it before, lingering in the house, even before we married. How long has this been going on? Years? My entire relationship with him?

He leaves, locking the door behind him, and I am left standing on the balcony, shattered. Tears spill down my cheeks, but beneath the grief, a small, fierce satisfaction stirs. He signed a prenup before we married. I wonder if he ever told Cyrene about that little detail.

I square my shoulders, wiping my face. I have work to do. It’s still early—enough time to call my lawyer, to visit the bank, to cancel every card and close every account he’s siphoning from. I need to get ahead of them, to reclaim what’s left of my life before the weekend arrives. I refuse to see either of them again—at least, not until I’m ready.

Time to make plans.

Chapter 2

Brielle's POV

“Mr. Halborough, could I schedule an appointment for, say, two o’clock this afternoon?” My voice comes out steady, polite—no hint of the tears that wracked me for half an hour as I tried to process what I’d just witnessed. I’ve forced the grief down deep, hidden the ache. Now there’s only business left: end this farce of a marriage, and maybe, if I’m lucky, find a way to make Cyrene pay for her part.

“Two o’clock? I can make that work. Could you give me a heads-up about the purpose of the appointment?”

“I’m filing for divorce,” I reply, flat and cold, the words suddenly real and tangible as they leave my lips. I feel the sting of fresh tears, but I clamp down hard. Not today. Not in public. I’m a doctor—trained to keep my composure with the dying and the grieving. I can do it now, too. Treat the end of my marriage as just another death, and wall away the part of me that wants to scream.

“I’m sorry to hear that. I’ll see you at two.” One task complete. What’s next?

I strip off my sweats and pull on a suit, wanting to look composed, untouchable. As I zip up the skirt, the song from our wedding plays through the house. My throat tightens and, despite my best intentions, tears streak down my cheeks again. Not for him—he doesn’t deserve that. It’s just for all I believed I had, for the story I told myself. But really, I’ve lost nothing but my own wounded pride.

I reapply my makeup; as I’m brushing on mascara, a different song comes on—one that feels more honest, more like the woman I am now: “I See Red,” by Everybody Loves an Outlaw. The raw, vengeful lyrics pulse through me, and I start singing along—loud, off-key. Balen always claimed I couldn’t carry a tune, but right now, I don’t care. I belt out the words, mangling the verses and laughing at my own wildness. It helps, this rage. It steadies me. I want to hurt them as much as they hurt me.

The drive to the bank is strangely quiet, the city thinned out in the late morning. But inside, the line snakes back and forth, a slow, shuffling crawl. I wait, arms folded, until a concierge spots me and ushers me away from the crowd, into a glass-walled office.

“What can we do for you today, Ms. Pendry?” the banker asks, all smooth politeness. He’s been warned; he knows I’m here to do something significant.

“I’d like to close my account. Please issue a bank cheque for the balance,” I say, keeping my voice formal and even. He blinks, startled, as he realizes I’m closing out over a million dollars. For this little branch, I might as well be a visiting monarch. I hold his gaze and smile.

This is the first real step—a clean break, a severing of the last financial thread between me and the man who betrayed me. No more credit cards, no more automatic payments to his accounts. The cow is dry. Let Balen and Cyrene scramble now. I hope whatever he siphoned off was worth it.

I stride out onto the sunlit street, my mind buzzing with next steps. I’m so focused I nearly miss Calitha, ducking into a café across the intersection. My feet carry me toward her as if I’m being pulled by a riptide.

“Hey, Calitha!” I call out, spotting her in a corner booth. She looks up, startled—her eyes red, mascara smudged. She’s been crying.

“Oh, hi Brielle. How are you?” Her voice is small, raw. I slide in beside her and wrap her in a quick, fierce hug, needing the comfort as much as she does. The waitress appears, hovering, so I shift back into my seat and force a bright smile.

“I’ll have a peppermint tea. Calitha, coffee and cake? My treat.”

“Yes, please,” she says, managing a grateful nod. The waitress scribbles the order and retreats, muttering under her breath. I shake my head, banishing the negativity.

“So, what’s going on?” I ask gently. “Why the tears?”

“My boss yelled at me this morning. It… it just got to me, that’s all. No big deal.” She tries to laugh it off, but her hands twist in her lap.

“You’re still in real estate, right?”

“Yeah. But the market’s slow right now. I’m hustling at the bottom end, while everyone else gets the big-ticket listings. I have to sell four or five properties just to meet my quota, while the favorites hit theirs in a single deal. It’s exhausting. And every time a high-priced home comes in, the boss hands it to someone else. I’m thinking about leaving, honestly. I’m not even sure he likes me.”

I reach across the table and squeeze her hand. “Well, today’s your lucky day. I need your help.”

She blinks at me, surprise flickering in her eyes. “What can I do for you? I feel like I’m always the one needing a hand.”

The drinks arrive. I wait for the waitress to leave, then glance around the café to make sure we’re alone. I lower my voice.

“My husband cheated. With Cyrene.”

Her gasp is sharp and immediate. “He didn’t. That scumbag… with her, of all people?”

I nod, jaw clenched. “So here’s what I need: I want you to list my house. I don’t even see it as home anymore. Get your auctioneer guy to clear out the junk I don’t want. You can take everything in the fridge and freezer—should last you a while. I’ll need a moving van, some muscle to move what I’m keeping to my next place, and Balen’s stuff to Cyrene’s garage.”

She stares at me. “What new place? You’ve already moved?”

“Not yet, but I’m heading to work right now. There’s an offer on the table at a private hospital—if it stands, I’ll take it. If I get the job, I’ll come back to sign whatever you need to list the house. I want you to have the listing, Calitha. If any of your colleagues try to poach it, I’ll refuse. This one’s yours. And I need a new place—gated, three bedrooms minimum, house or penthouse, near the hospital.”

Calitha’s eyes fill again, but this time it’s not from sadness. “Furnished or unfurnished?” She’s all business now, tablet out, fingers flying.

“I’m starting from scratch. I don’t mind, as long as I’m not hauling old beds and couches. If it’s a penthouse, at least semi-furnished would be great.”

“Let me send you this,” I say, thumbing through my phone to find the land deed from my home purchase. I forward it to her.

“Thank you. Give me a couple hours—I’ll pull some listings and have the paperwork ready.”

“My lawyer appointment’s at two. I’ll come by after?”

“Perfect.” Calitha’s smile is bright, shaky—like she’s just been handed a lifeline.

“Can you have the auctioneer come over after we’re done? You handle the details. The sooner it’s over, the better. I can stay in a motel if I have to.”

“I’ll text you the details later,” she promises.

I drain my tea, give Calitha another hug, and walk out into the bright day, hope flickering in my chest for the first time. There’s work ahead, and I’m not sure what the future holds, but I have a plan—and, for now, that is enough.

Chapter 3

Brielle’s POV

Fortunately, my boss isn’t busy when I arrive at the hospital. He looks up from his desk, warm and unflappable as ever, his easy charm undimmed by the stress of the job.

“What brings you in on your day off, Brielle?” he asks, the corners of his eyes creasing with genuine concern. I’ve always liked him—he’s a straight shooter, compassionate without ever being sentimental.

I steady my voice. “I’m going through… a rough patch, personally. I wanted to ask if the private hospital job you mentioned is still open?”

He leans back and sighs. “The one I offered you last month? That’s been filled, I’m afraid.” The floor seems to drop from under me for a split second—my last hope for a clean break, gone.

But then he offers a lifeline. “However, I do have something else, if you’re interested. The research division of the heart clinic needs a manager. We’re running multiple trials; I need someone who can take charge and run with it. You’d work alongside Dr. Myndale, who manages the surgical clinic.”

I blink, stunned by the offer. “Are you serious? I’d love that—thank you. Yes, I’ll take it.”

He doesn’t hesitate. “Good. I’ve got the paperwork right here—take your time, read it over and sign. Would a month be enough for you to get your personal affairs in order before starting?”

“That’s perfect,” I say, almost breathless with relief. “It’s been a pleasure having you here, Brielle. Why don’t you take the next two weeks off to get settled in Preston and start fresh?”

I stand, shaking his hand with a gratitude that’s hard to put into words. He never once mentions the mess in my personal life, and I am grateful for that, too.

“Two weeks is plenty,” I assure him, scanning the contract. I sign, almost in disbelief—I’m about to earn more money than I did as a heart surgeon. The irony isn’t lost on me. I tuck the contract into my bag just as the receptionist appears.

“Mr. Halborough will see you now.” I’m ushered into my lawyer’s office. He’s older now, hair gone mostly gray, but still sharp-eyed and handsome in a dignified way. His son—more youthful, but with the same steady gaze—sits beside him, quietly absorbing everything.

“Talk to me, Brielle,” Mr. Halborough prompts. He’s been my lawyer since my grandfather’s day, always in my corner.

I draw a slow breath. “Let me show you something first. Then you can tell me if there’s any way I can get a quick divorce today.” I send the video across, watching as father and son view the damning evidence, my stomach twisting with every silent second.

“With this video and your prenup, we can have this in front of a judge within hours,” he assures me. “If all goes smoothly, you’ll be free by tonight. Any other issues?”

“Yes. I need to amend my will. Everything to charity, at least for now.”

“Noted. Give me twenty minutes and I’ll have the paperwork ready for you to sign.”

I hand over my bank statements, heart pounding. “He wasn’t even supposed to have access to this much—Balen had a ten-thousand-dollar daily limit, but he’s been draining the account over that, and the bank must be helping him. I closed it, threatened a lawsuit if they didn’t comply. Some of those purchases—gifts for Cyrene—were made against my wishes. Can I get the expensive ones back?”

He’s already scowling. “That’s theft. The prenup is clear. We can threaten criminal charges if they don’t return them. Leave it to me.” He almost seems to relish the prospect; he never liked how Balen wormed his way into my life.

“Anything we can do to make Cyrene sweat?” I ask, my voice tight. “You saw the video.”

“Nothing immediate, but I’ll speak to the judge tonight—see if there’s anything I’ve missed.”

“I’ll wait outside while you draft everything.” I step into the corridor and dial Calitha.

“Calitha Serevan speaking, how can I help you?”

I moved to a different country recently, and here, a urine test is required before a doctor can prescribe my ADHD med. Back home, we'd get a bottle in which to put my urine in a private bathroom where there are little square containers to catch the urine then pour into the bottle. The bottle is then placed in a cubby hole in the wall with stainless doors on either side. I place the bottle in that hole and walk away, and the person on the other side would collect it, do the labelling, etc. and send it away. This morning, I went to the place where do the tests (my first time in the new country) and a very nice phlebotomist (phew, I was so anxious about who I might get and I think I got very lucky!) sat me down, went through paperwork quite thoroughly and explained how they would be thinking about nothing at all, and everything irrelevant, assured me that they do it all day every day, etc. Until this moment, it never clicked that I have to pee in front of a stranger while they watch. Nobody told me that was going to happen (perhaps they thought I somehow knew that's the procedure?), and while the paper says 'in presence of', I didn't know the toilet cubicle had to be open and I had to be in full view of another person. The phlebotomist was thankfully professional and kind, but it was only when I stepped inside the toilet cubicle and the phlebotomist 'reminded me' to keep the door open that I realised what I had to do. I didn't have a meltdown or anything. In fact, I handled the situation quite well although in my mind, chaos was breaking loose. I was already SO nervous about going to a new place alone... stepping outside my place, using public transport, walking along streets with all these people, interacting with medical people and taking the trip back home. I drank some coffee just before I went into the testing centre to try and encourage my bladder, too, but the nerves got to me and I couldn't produce quite enough... Once everything was sealed away, I was free to go.

As I walked out, I continued listening to an audiobook I was listening to on the way there, but I'm afraid I missed everything. I was halfway on autopilot coming back home because what just happened kept playing in my head and I was so very confused. I still don't know why I'm so 'confused'. I got myself some treat at a local bakery which I'd have dug into as soon as I got home but it's been just sitting next to me as I'm trying to process what's going on. I usually like to know what's coming so I can prepare myself. Social events, visiting somewhere/someone, medical appointments, etc. are all more likely to be dealt with better if I know well in advance. Today, a crucial piece of information was missing and I had no time at all to get myself together. I'm now not so sure if it would have been less stressful if I knew all the details in advance. It might have been overwhelming leading toward it. Would you please share your perspective on whether you like to know what's coming in advance? Does that always benefit you? Any stories of successfully dealing with stressful situations because you knew all the details in advance or because you were actually unaware of the most stressful part?

Thanks so much for reading a long post. I hope you have a day with something wonderful in it.",1,1754535894.0,AuDHDWomen,0,0.67,False

In a humble village nestled amidst rolling hills of the Scottish Highlands, February of 1979 welcomed a boy into the world. Born during faint glimmers of winter sunshine, his early years were shrouded in innocence, marked by gentle songs of larks and the whisper of breezes through the heather. The village, with its weathered stone cottages and comforting aroma of peat fires, held a magic for a child. It was a sanctuary, a place where the world felt safe, and every patch of grass was ripe for adventure.

Yet, the boy was shy, buoyed by an innocence that others swiftly recognized. At home, amid his hardworking parents, his spirit remained untainted, untouched by the harshness of life outside his front door. But when he first stepped into the schoolhouse at the tender age of five, the world morphed before his wide, unassuming eyes. Bright murals on the walls, laughter of children, and the scent of chalk soon turned into a cacophony of voices that mocked and jeered at his naivety.

As the seasons changed, so too did the laughter in his heart. Each day emerged from the warmth of home only to be met with cold realities of playground taunts and disdainful expressions. The slight boy with fluffy ginger curls and big, earnest eyes quickly became an easy target for those seeking to establish dominance amid the merciless social hierarchy of childhood. His innocent questions and wide-eyed bewilderment were fodder for their jeers, riddling him with confusion and a growing sense of dread.

By fifteen, school eventually turned into a prison of misery. The boy became adept at avoiding torment, mastering the art of disappearing into corners or feigning illness and disappearing to escape cruelty. Yet, the sanctuary of home began to crack. A weight of anxiety hung heavy on his heart—a silent companion shadowing every step. The vibrant boy with dreams of castles and dragons became a shell, weary from running, longing for solace amidst chaos.

Eventually, his father, weary of seeing his son stripped of joy, made the decision to pull him from school. It felt like a glimmer of hope, a chance to heal; yet the boy sensed it was merely the beginning of a darker chapter. With school behind him, the silence of home grew suffocating, amplifying thoughts he couldn’t silence—growing uncontrollable, swirling like a tempest in his mind.

In quiet moments, the boy sought distractions, finding solace in the thrill of gambling—pennies transformed into fantasies while buttons of slot machines adorned promises of escape. But as quickly as the thrill ignited, the chill of reality returned, demanding payment. Bottles of cider slid into view, and soon the boy who had dared to dream became lost in a fog of intoxication. Days turned into nights, thoughts muddled and scattered like fallen leaves in the autumn wind.

Moments of clarity slipped through his fingers as the years passed. Laughter became stifled, buried beneath a heavy weight of regret. The mental institution emerged as a last-ditch effort; three months of mandated reflection, yet those walls could not contain the storm within. One fateful night, after indulging too deeply in the very escape designed to save him, he woke to the agony of choices. Staff found him lurching and desperate grappling with thoughts twisted around his heart like thorny vines.

Flung back into the world, he stood alone, abandoned by the institution meant to heal him. Streets that were once a playground of innocence turned cold and unwelcoming, echoing with shadows of a fractured existence. As he wandered through the village, lost among familiar facades, he felt like a ghost, haunting the life he once possessed, yearning for warmth of safety that had slipped through his fingers.

And so, in the village, the boy born under gentle rays of winter gradually faded from sight, eclipsed by a tempestuous storm of adulthood where innocence, once his shield, became history a bittersweet memory of days that could have been.

Chapter two. Shadows of the Past.

The stark white walls of the mental hospital faded into a distant memory, yet the vibrant image of her smile lingered like an echo in his mind. Before he was unceremoniously expelled from that place, he had found solace in the presence of a girl whose laughter rang like music in the sterile hallways. There was something about her, a light in the darkness that drew him to her, igniting a hope he thought had vanished amidst the chaos of his existence.

In the weeks that followed his release, he found himself trapped in a downward spiral, drifting between the chaotic confines of homeless shelters and fleeting nights at bed and breakfasts. The bottle became his companion, the only constant in a world that felt increasingly unwelcoming. He was haunted by her image, a flicker of happiness overshadowed by the haze of alcohol. Each sip meant a deepening of his despair, and with every drink, he slipped further from the man he once aspired to be.

His trusted companions disillusionment and inebriation encouraged reckless decisions. He often found himself in precarious situations, wrapped in dust and regret, doing things he’d never dare attempt while sober. The few friends he had adorned the streets like ghosts, each locked in their own battle with demons manifested through substance abuse.

The turning point arrived when the girl’s name resurfaced in his life like awaited sunrise after a long, dark night. She had finally been released, her own battle fought with the shadows of her past. With a renewed sense of hope, he invited her to a quiet existence in a remote village, far removed from the cacophony of city life.

At first, the days felt different; they shared laughter that echoed in the still air and rediscovered dreams in the light of day. It was an imperfect paradise, a refuge from their previous torments, or so he thought. But as seasons changed, so did the tides of his heart. The familiar thirst for alcohol returned, creeping into the corners of their sanctuary and eroding the fragile connection they had formed.

What once felt like a second chance began to morph into an avalanche of chaos. The tranquility of the village morphed into an idyllic illusion, shattered by his relentless drinking. The girl, far more resilient than he gave her credit for, tried to reach out, but he drifted further into his own abyss, leaving her stranded on the shores of their dreams.

Before long, the walls of their shared haven turned into boundaries he felt impelled to break. When reality overwhelmed him, he packed his things with an impossibly heavy heart, leaving her behind, reminiscing about their fleeting moments. The retreat into homelessness felt easier than facing the consequences of his actions, even with the knowledge that she deserved better.

In the city’s hold,  he found himself once again residing in a hostel, an unremarkable room with peeling paint and flickering fluorescent light. Here, the streets sang the same haunting song, intertwined with addiction and desperation. Yet within this new cycle, he discovered an unexpected glimmer of hope—a list for a home program that promised stability. After months of waiting, his name finally appeared, and he was awarded a flat, a small sanctuary to call his own.

Though life felt more structured, loneliness crept in swiftly. The dim lights of his flat felt cold and uninviting, a stark contrast to the warmth of their shared moments in the village. He couldn’t help but think of her, of how she was faring without him by her side. The days turned into weeks, and their contact dwindled, yet memories of her beauty persisted. 

Then came an unexpected phone call a reminder that not all connections are severed. He learned she was back in the mental hospital, her path again entangled in the murk of her own battles. It was as if fate pulled the strings one last time; he knew he had to reach out. Against the backdrop of his ongoing struggles, he sought solace where their story began.

Months passed like the seasons changed, but finally, she was released once more. His heart raced as he invited her into his life, a tentative offer of companionship amidst his turmoil. When she arrived at his flat, the air felt charged with possibility—a fragile thread connecting their disparate worlds once again.

Days turned into weeks, and together they navigated the challenges of rebuilding their lives. Laughter filled the corners of his flat, remnants of their past woven into the fabric of their present. The shadows that followed each of them were daunting, but they found moments of light through shared experiences—cooking together, late-night conversations, and the simplicity of just being. 

However, as the sun began to set on their newfound connection, old habits clawed back to the forefront of his mind. Alcohol still beckoned him, a siren song whispering empty promises of escape. He felt her gaze upon him, the worry etched on her face when he stumbled back into old patterns. 

He found himself at a crossroads, clinging to the reassuring chaos that alcohol provided yet yearning for the clarity that comes from facing one’s demons. The weight of his choices hung heavy; the girl, their dreams, threatened to unravel if he succumbed again. 

As they sat together on the worn-out couch, she held his hand, a silent plea for him to choose differently this time. And in that moment, he realized that real strength lay not in seeking solace through bottles, but in confronting the shadows growing within.

Together they stood, facing the dawn with cautious optimism, inviting light into their lives while navigating the murky waters of recovery and hope. Each day became a battle of choices, with love guiding their way. The journey ahead remained uncertain, but he finally understood that reaching out for help was a sign of strength, not weakness, as they stepped into an unknown future, determined to create a different ending to their story or so he thought.

While he and his girlfriend were still residing in Murrayfield Walk, Dundee, their lives took a turn when they were offered a modest one-bedroom flat in Coupar Angus. The flat was small and nestled within a close-knit village community, with observant neighbors always peeking into each other’s lives. Being 15-20 miles from both Perth and Dundee, the location provided a semblance of peace, away from the hustle of city life.

As the months passed in their new home, they settled into a routine like any other couple. It was during this time that they received joyous news his girlfriend was pregnant with their first child, a boy. Their hearts swelled with excitement and anticipation, and it felt as if the world had suddenly brightened.

Their joy blossomed further when they became friends with the former resident of their flat, who lived nearby. This new connection offered a chance for change: their friend proposed a flat swap, and they eagerly agreed. Within a month, they moved into a small house, which boasted two bedrooms, perfect for the new family they were eager to build.

Not long after the move, their son was born, albeit after a forced delivery that left both parents shaken. The first two months with him were magical, filled with long, leisurely walks to the park and cherished days out. However, beneath the surface, the struggle with alcohol loomed larger in his life, casting a shadow over their happiness.

As the couple tried to navigate the challenges of parenthood, things deteriorated. Social services intervened, redirecting their path entirely. The emotional blow of their son being taken away to be fostered by his girlfriend’s parents was profound. They diligently attended a visiting center to see their child, their hearts aching with each visit as they faced the reality of their situation.

Ultimately, despite their attempts to change and the love they held for their son, he was adopted by his girlfriend’s parents, a decision that left them both feeling lost. The pain of this loss became intertwined with a new dilemma; his girlfriend found herself pregnant again. This time, the news hung heavy on her heart. After much deliberation, she expressed a desire to abort the baby, feeling unprepared to navigate the complexities of parenthood once more.

With little time left and the clock ticking Scotland’s NHS had a strict cutoff of six months for abortions they reached out to a firm called BPAS, located in Surrey, England. The urgency intensified as they made preparations for the journey, knowing they needed a solution within a month.

They took an overnight bus from Scotland to England, bound for a clinic that felt like a bittersweet end to their dreams. As they traveled, emotions swirled within them. They felt a knot of anxiety, loss, and lingering hope for a future where their past wouldn’t anchor them down, but the road ahead seemed daunting. A mixture of dread and relief hung in the air as they braced themselves for the decisions that lay before them.

Chapter Three: Awakening

The fluorescent lights hummed softly above him, a robotic choir that pulsed in rhythm with his weary heart. The world slowly came into focus, revealing the sterile white walls of a hospital room, adorned with the occasional splash of color from a visitor’s bouquet. His body felt foreign, heavy, each limb weighted down as if encased in cement. The beeping of machines punctuated the silence, a constant reminder that he was still tethered to life, though barely.

Three months, an eternity, spent deep within the veil of an induced coma. He shifted slightly, wincing as a sharp pain lanced through his abdomen. An internal reminder of the acute severe pancreatitis that had fought him like a feral beast, a relentless struggle reflected in the grim faces of the doctors and the anxiety of his family. The memory was a fleeting shadow, but its implications were crystal clear. Life would never be the same.

Slowly, he turned his head, the tubes and monitors clinging to him like a second skin. He had six drains, three on either side, an arterial line snaking from his neck to a kidney dialysis machine that hummed steadily by his bedside. The tracheostomy provided uncomfortable breaths, but it was a necessity, a cruel but vital lifeline. Each beep from the machines echoed in a chorus, whispering statistics of survival, (0.01%), a cruel joke that faded into the background of clinical jargon.

Lifting a hand, he watched it tremble as if it belonged to someone else entirely. He felt utterly disoriented, lost in a maze of emotions that cycled from gratitude to despair. The realization that he had defied the odds sent a wave of pain and love crashing over him. His parents had been there, piecing his reality together in the darkness, holding on to hope while he fought demons in silence. 

The sound of footsteps drew his attention, and his gaze softened at the sight of his mother. Her face was etched with lines of worry and relief, a mixture that made his heart ache. She approached cautiously, as if he were made of glass. “Honey,” she said, her voice cracking like a twig underfoot. “You’re awake.”

It felt surreal, hearing her voice after so long. He attempted to reply, but his throat felt scratchy and dry, the tracheostomy limiting him to soft whispers. Instead, he nodded, a simple gesture that seemed monumental in this moment of shared vulnerability.

“Your father will be here soon,” she continued, wiping a tear that escaped down her cheek. “We… we’re so relieved. We didn’t know if you would come back to us.”

Those words hit him like a tidal wave, crashing against the fragile dam of his emotions. He knew he had put them through hell, their eyes heavy with fear as they witnessed his battle. Thoughts of his father sitting quietly in the corner of the room, fighting back tears, flashed through his mind. The moments of shared laughter lingered, but now they were tainted with the weight of vulnerability. He wouldn’t have wished this on anyone, and yet amidst the chaos, their love shone, a resilient anchor.

His fingers twitched, reaching for her. “I’m… sorry,” he managed to croak, his voice barely audible but filled with sincerity. 

“Don’t you dare apologize,” she replied fiercely, her grip on his hand tightening. “You’ve fought so hard. We’re just grateful you’re here now. That’s what matters.” I’m sure he remembers his mother saying?

Each word wove a feeling of comfort that enveloped him. He would face long days of recovery, but for now, he soaked in the warmth of her presence. It was a bittersweet victory, overshadowed by the reality of what lay ahead. The whispers of doctors had painted a grim picture, discussions of rehabilitation, possible complications, and a slower pace of life than he had ever anticipated. Would he be the same person when he left this place? 

The days blurred into one another, marked by the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the soft shuffle of nurses. His body was a battlefield, each procedure a reminder of the fragility of existence. Therapy sessions felt like climbing mountains, each milestone a small victory. He pushed through the pain, driven by the love he felt for his family, who were now his unwavering support.

His father’s presence was steady, an unyielding lighthouse in the stormy seas of his recovery.  He could see the flicker of hope in his father’s eyes.

In time, he learned to appreciate the small victories. The first time he sat up, the first step taken with shaky legs, and the moment he could breathe easier without the machines. Each triumph was celebrated, shared with those who had remained steadfast through the ordeal, his lifeline in the dark.

Months passed, and the seasons began to change outside the hospital windows. He had started to reclaim parts of his identity, albeit in a new form. He was not the same person he once was; scars had reshaped him, both inside and out. But each day was a chance to redefine himself, to face the blank canvas of his life.

As he sat in his hospital room, watching the leaves change colors through the glass, he felt a flicker of determination ignite within him. He would not allow his trauma to define him. Instead, he would use it as a stepping stone toward a life filled with purpose and renewal. 

Survival was no longer just a statistic—it was his new reality. He was a survivor, a warrior molded by pain but tempered by the unconditional love of those who stood by him. The road ahead would be long, but he no longer feared it. He was ready to embrace whatever came next, armed with the strength of a hundred battles fought and won.

 Chapter 4: Stairway to Change

His life would never be the same. Discharging himself from the hospital, he returned home as his girlfriend wished. Now wheelchair-bound, he dreaded the bus ride to their new home: a top floor flat with no banisters. The thought of navigating the stairs filled him with anxiety; he resorted to bum shuffling, pulling himself up step by step. His girlfriend, ever by his side, carried his wheelchair and Zimmer frame to the top.

Weeks passed in that flat. He relied heavily on his Zimmer frame, feeling trapped and frustrated. The confines of those walls echoed with his struggle. Then, a glimmer of hope arrived. They were offered a temporary two bedroom ground-floor flat. It was a fresh start, an opportunity to breathe again.

Physiotherapy came twice weekly, each session aimed at helping him reclaim his mobility. With diligent effort, they embarked on walks, slowly exploring the world outside. Each step was a victory, a testament to his resilience, and a reminder of her unwavering love. They cherished each moment together, despite the challenges.

Yet, as they thrived in their love, he sensed approaching uncertainty, a shift that could change everything he thought he understood about their relationship. What lay ahead, regarding his next move to a more permanent home he did not expect.

Settling in Letham, they moved to a pokey, dingy two-bedroom flat. The walls, trapped under layers of at least five different wallpapers, spoke of neglect and age. A musty, mouldy smell wafted from the kitchen, a reminder of its unkempt state. One of the cupboards even hosted a few stubborn flies, buzzing lazily as if accustomed to the gloom of their new home.

The living room felt like a cramped cupboard, while the bedrooms resembled postage stamps—small and suffocating. It was a stark contrast to the hopes they had built, and as he unpacked their belongings, a weight of anxiety settled in his chest. He silently worried about their living conditions and tightening finances, feeling the burden of responsibility pressing down on him.

Yet, amid these concerns, joy blossomed. Back at their old flat, his girlfriend had become pregnant, and they later discovered they were expecting twins. Ecstatic yet worried, they embraced the news, their hearts filled with anticipation and a touch of panic. How would they manage?

Later that year, 2011, in a moment of commitment and love, he proposed to her. Their celebration was humble, marked by coffee and a slice of toast, a quiet acknowledgment of the journey ahead. Money was tight, but his disability car provided a means for her to drive around, giving them some semblance of normalcy amidst the chaos.

Despite the challenges, they remained close, united in their dreams and fears. Their connection deepened, their shared laughter echoing through the small flat, but reality loomed. The birth of their twin girls in January 2013 marked a pivotal moment. As they cradled their daughters, a profound love enveloped them, but so did an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

Later that same year, they were offered a two-bedroom flat on Edinburgh Road in Perth—a chance for a fresh start. It was a beacon of hope amid their struggles, symbolizing their resilience and determination to create a better life for their growing family. As they prepared to move, he couldn’t shake the feeling that every step forward came with its own set of challenges, but together, they would face whatever lay ahead.

I’m in my 30s, coming from a small town and have looked at many places in SD (thanks to reddit suggestions!) and can’t seem to find what feels like the right fit! I get pretty anxious w/ the big city/no parking/large parking structures! I’m looking for a happy medium area in SD. Hoping to stay central enough to activities (coffee shops, breweries, salsa dancing!) but not in the city city if that makes sense! North park and mission valley seem great but too city like for me! Same w beach cities! Tierresanta felt too quiet! Also visited Carlsbad and Oceanside which felt more in my comfort zone but felt a little far out.  

Questions- 
1) what other areas would you recommend I explore?
2) am I being unrealistic trying to find rentals with private access garages? For safety purposes this is very important to me but has been very difficult to find! Also really prefer gated. If anyone knows of any complexes that they love, def appreciate any suggestions!

Budget ideally around 3,000 but flexible!

Although we mistakenly made our reservation the day after we thought it was, our server, who was excellent, was able to seat us even with a wedding reception was taking place in the afternoon. The entire setting and atmosphere of this restaurant is incredible, and our server spoke to us in a hushed tone and served our courses with intense care, which felt intentional as if he was trying to not disturb not just us but the setting of the restaurant. 

I have been to a few other Michelin quality tasting menu restaurants (mainly in DC and NYC in the states but a few in Florence and Paris) and this was my favorite experience. The courses were complex in flavor and interesting but not in any way unapproachable, and left us completely satisfied. The pricing was very fair and the service was exceptional. 

My favorite course was the Urdaibai tomato textures, served in a martini glass and featured tomatoes prepared in 5 different ways layered on top of each other.

But then I’m really thinking about it and all of the bad ones are really just people being impatient or just straight up wrong. 

Like they’re all “the drive through is so slow just for a coffee,” yeah Brenda, because you decided to come get a coffee at peak hours when people ahead of you are ordering large meals. It’s not going to be ten seconds, come one.

Or there’s a few that are along the lines of “these employees are all brain dead and have no idea what’s going on.” Yeah, like 5/40 are really dumb and have one brain cell, but I literally work with the other “brain dead employees,” and I can tell you they’re not. Like? 

And my personal favourite, “every employee is stoned out of their mind.” Sir, I can assure you, I know every person that works here, not one of them comes to work stoned (huge accomplishment, I know). So why are we pulling things out of our butts. 

Like there’s the odd valid poor review that shows a picture of a messed up order, or a complaint about the quality of the food, especially late night. But being 100% honest, people are just exaggerating beyond reason because the happened to come at the busiest time.

Before people misinterpret things — yes, Carrie was in the wrong for cheating on him. Twice. I don’t think anyone on earth would disagree. 

But that doesn’t change the fact that his behaviour when they got back together was immature, aggressive, and honestly, if Carrie was my friend in real life, I would be worried about him getting physical with her. It’s understandable that he would have trust issues after what she did to him, anyone would. Which is why the right response when she asked him to get back together would’ve been to tell her F off and remove her from your life. 

Instead, he agreed to get back together and then immediately started treating her like shit. I am watching season four right now and after he hears the voicemail from Big, rather than addressing his (justified) feelings and fears to Carrie like you would expect from an emotionally mature person, he instead:
- Ignores her when she tries to make conversation
- Literally SMACKS her (!!!) under the guise of putting on a nicotine patch
- Gives a passive aggressive, “Why would I be mad at you?” when Carrie notices his weird behaviour and asks him about it
- Lies about having a ‘boys night’ at Steve and makes it clear she’s not welcome (“You can come, don’t come, whatever. Do what you like.”)
- Openly flirts with and jokes with the bartender at Steve’s bar in front of her 
- Doesn’t even bother to call and tell her he’s not coming over
- Getting coffee with the bartender the next day when he’s supposedly working

All this to punish Carrie for cheating instead of either addressing directly it with her or simply dumping her. I’ve had a cheating ex try to get back to me, I’m sure most of us have — I just laughed in his face. Nobody forced him to get back with Carrie; if he couldn’t trust her—which is understandable—he should’ve just not gotten back together with her. They’d only dated for a few months and didn’t share kids or pets or anything to keep them tied together. Rewatching this season, I don’t feel bad for him at all because Carrie’s red flags were right there from the beginning (like when she said that she refused to cut Big out) and instead of acting like a normal person and immediately removing himself the situation, he instead tried to continue the relationship and mold her into his version of a dream woman. It’s like dating Nick Cannon and being surprised when he wants to get you pregnant. You know what they say, fool me once, shame on you…..

That’s why I believe the theory that the reason he got back together with her in AJLT was to punish her. 

(Again—because some people need to have these things explicitly stated—I am in no way diminishing Carrie’s responsibility or actions during this time period. She is obviously a screaming red flag and an awful partner. However, Aidan is as well and it’s just that Carrie’s actions were so egregious just that it makes his actions seem justified/normal when they are actually abusive)",6,1754535485.0,Andjustlikethat,3,0.8,False
1mjotid,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjotid,How do you plan and share “to-go” spots with friends or partners when travel hacking?,"Hi everyone,  
I'm doing some early research on a tool I built that might be helpful for people who love travel hacking, especially when planning trips with someone else.  
  
When I travel solo, I just drop pins on Google Maps. But when I’m planning a trip with my girlfriend or friends, things get messier — we send links back and forth, lose track of saved places, or end up duplicating lists.  
  
To solve this, I built a small map-based web app (currently only in Japanese) where you can create shared lists of places you want to visit — restaurants, cafés, sights, etc. You can add notes, tag locations, and send the whole list as a link.  
No account is needed to view a list, and collaborative editing is supported if you sign up.  
  
Here’s what I’d love to know from you:  
  
・Do you ever run into this problem when planning trips with others?  
  
・Would a collaborative “to-go” map actually help your travel planning?  
  
・Any features that would make it more useful?  
  
I’m not promoting anything — just trying to learn if this solves a real pain point for travelers who plan together.

These small amounts of giving feel as good to me as a purchase.

Another thing that takes the place of shopping for me is browsing and reserving books and audiobooks on Libby, an app for accessing digital library materials. I don’t always get through everything I reserve but it was fun to hoard the books for a while.

I just graduated and have a remote job lined up, so I’m planning to finally be (starting January) living somewhere new in Latin America. I’m still looking for a place that fits a very specific vibe, and I’d really appreciate any input you’ve got. This is a big decision for me, and it means a lot that you’re taking the time to help 🙏



What I’m looking for:

Beach access is a must + big bonus if there are mountains or hikes nearby



Sunny, warm weather



Walkable or bikeable towns/cities (or at least scooter/motorbike friendly)



Friendly, “shirt off your back” locals and rich local culture



A place that’s quiet and  not as nightlife-focused (I’m a morning coffee kind of guy, not a club guy)



Low bug population,  picky, but I get eaten alive



Somewhere I can immerse in the local town,  not looking  as much for a party hostel vibe



A mid-size place that still has: Coffee shops, coworking spaces, or places to work from, Decent gyms + good grocery stores, Uber or scooter rentals



A musician community or local jam scene (I play guitar/sing and would love to connect casually)



Other travelers/remote workers, but not too touristy



Affordable cost of living

  


This trip is a reset after college burnout and a test run of the digital nomad lifestyle.

But more than that, I’m hoping to grow and spend this time creating, exploring, and breathing. **I’m not chasing nightlife or food scenes** (I unfortunately have dietary restrictions and mostly cook), I’m chasing quiet mornings, local connections, and long walks after sunset.



My ideal weekly routine looks like:

Wake up early, grab coffee, and work a few hours remotely (I don’t need perfect internet – not on many calls)



Explore a nearby hiking trail or nature spot



Spend time on the beach in the afternoons



Meet locals or other travelers through a class, club, or volunteering



Work on some creative projects (music + writing)



Eat some oysters if they’re around – I love seafood 🦪



For context, here are two places I’ve been:

Querétaro, Mexico (study abroad): Loved the people, super welcoming and warm



Medellín, Colombia (work trip): Loved the nature, mountains, weather, and general vibe. This trip really sparked my love for South America, and was my favorite.|

  
Any place cross your mind?

1mjorpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mjorpq/aitah_for_calling_my_mother_a_fck_idiot/,AITAH for calling my mother a f*ck*** idiot,"Hello! I (18F) recently went to visit my mother’s (37F) house to congratulate my sister (14F) for starting high school, but instead of letting me congratulate my sister, she made it all about herself by abruptly announcing she was pregnant 

I’m used to my mom taking over other people’s moments, she made all of my older twin brothers birthdays about the fact she birthed two twin boys as a teenager without an epidural, she made my academic achievements about the fact I wouldn’t have them if I didn’t take after her, which is silly to me because I am NOTHING like her, and my younger sisters tell me she’s doing similar things with them, and to be honest none of my siblings like her, but we don’t say anything because we’re all going either LC or NC when my 14 year old sister (she’s the youngest) moves out 

None of that is why I called her a fucking idiot, the reason I called her that is because of what she chose to name the baby. Loveleigh Pryncess. 

Yes she wants to name the baby, lovely princess. 

My mom is one of those moms when it comes to naming babies, all of my siblings including me have and/ or had some of the worst names I could ever think of. My older twin brothers were named Raidyr (Ryder) and Raisyr (Racer) before they legally changed it to more appropriate names.

I was named MOCHA. after the literal coffee before I changed it to the name my dad’s mom wanted to name me, and it’s very beautiful, much better than MOCHA. My younger sister was named Perwinkle. She doesn’t feel like changing her name so she goes by Peri, or Winnie and my youngest sister’s name is by far the worst but since she is a minor and requested me to omit her name, I will respect her privacy 

So as you can see from our names my mom cannot name for shit and I told her as such when she told me that she was serious about naming my poor unborn sister that wretched name

Verbatim I said something along the lines of “You’re a fucking idiot if you think she won’t get bullied for that name, you have five children who all got bullied because of your need to be different please don’t do this to her” and I know it was mean, I truly do, but she knows how badly me and my siblings were bullied and made fun of for our names, and whenever we came to her crying because of it, she’d dismiss it and tell us that they (the bullies) were jealous. 

As a response to what I said about the name, my mother called me a cunt and ran off crying to her husband, my stepdad (43M) who cursed me out for making my “Poor old mother cry” and to apologize for doing do and yeah I do feel bad for making her cry but I don’t feel bad for finally telling her to stop, enough is enough and she’s not naming a pet or even a doll, she’s naming someone who could become someone’s boss, someone’s doctor, someone’s lawyer!

I know if my lawyer was named Loveleigh Pryncess I would not take them seriously, and as someone who is studying to become a teacher, I have definitely been looked down on because of my name, and honestly if I haven’t changed my name I know for a fact it’d be a lot worse now that i’m an adult in college rather than a child in middle school

But alas, AITA for calling my mom a fucking idiot over a baby name?",2,1754535344.0,AITAH,32,0.67,False

I don’t even want to go to meetings because I’m scared someone I know will see me. I don’t want my family or my kids to know what I’m dealing with. It’s hard to explain, but it’s this quiet shame that keeps me stuck.

The truth is, I’ve started to adopt my regulars at the bar as my “family” — because they’re the only people who’ve really seen *me*. Not just as a mom. Not just as a worker. And not just as a “stupid drunk.” They accepted me, even in the mess.

But I’m starting to see that **might be part of the problem** — that all my connections are built around alcohol. And now I’m stuck. I want real friends — the kind of people who’d grab coffee with me or just sit and talk — but I’m too scared to show up to a meeting or reach out, because I feel like I’ll be judged or exposed.

I don’t know how to fix this on my own.

Fall candles are my favorite part of the year. There’s something about walking into Bath & Body Works when the shelves are packed with pumpkins, apples, spice, and woods. I went in and smelled every single fall candle on the floor and took my time with each one. Some were immediate favorites, some surprised me, and a few I wouldn’t reach for again. Here’s how I’d rank them, from must-haves to ones I’d personally skip.
	
1.	Leaves
Still the standard for fall. Crisp apple and clove with just the right amount of warmth. Smells like the start of the season.
	
2.	Pumpkin Pecan Waffles
Rich, sweet, and heavy in the best way. Like waffles drowning in syrup. Great throw and a true gourmand favorite.
	
3.	Sweater Weather
Clean and crisp with a little herbal sharpness. It smells like cold air and fresh laundry. Always refreshing.
	
4.	Campfire Cocoa
Smooth hot chocolate with a little smoke. Not too artificial, surprisingly comforting and warm.

	5.	Pumpkin S’mores
Toasty marshmallow, a bit of chocolate, and just enough graham. Sweet but rounded. It feels like fall nights.
	
6.	Caramel Pumpkin Swirl
Heavy caramel with vanilla and a little spice. Very sweet, almost like frosting, but done well.
	
7.	Cranberry Woods
Tart, woodsy, and balanced. Not overly sweet. It’s more of a fall evening scent and feels cozy in a different way.
	
8.	Cozy Sunday Night
Warm and soft. Hints of cinnamon and vanilla but more mellow. It smells like being wrapped in a blanket.
	
9.	Pumpkin Apple
Bright red apple with mellow pumpkin. A classic, familiar blend that fills a room quickly.
	
10.	Cinnamon Sugar Coffee Cake
Spicy and sweet. You can really pick up the cinnamon crumble. It smells like something baking in the oven.
	
11.	Flannel
A little sharper and more masculine. Leans cologne but still wearable at home. Good for cooler nights.
	
12.	Autumn Woods
Deep, smooth, and slightly smoky. Has that calming, woody warmth without being heavy.
	
13.	Cider Lane
Sweet caramel and apple. Almost candy-like but with a fall backdrop. Smells like a seasonal treat.
	
14.	A Day at the Café
Warm coffee and a little milkiness. Soft overall, not overly strong but pleasant and cozy.
	
15.	Frozen Lake
Cool and clean with eucalyptus and a little lavender. Not particularly fall, but nice for freshening a space.
	
16.	Cranberry and Gala Apple
Bright and fruity. Crisp and light. Not as rich as other fall scents but fresh and easy to burn.
	
17.	Book Loft
Dry woods and soft citrus. Has a quiet, peaceful vibe. Not strong, but elegant in its own way.
	
18.	Pumpkin Cinnamon Bun
Sweet frosting and spice. Strong bakery scent, maybe a little one-note, but fans of sweet candles will love it.
	
19.	Vanilla Bean
Very simple and clean. Not a standout for fall, but easy to blend with others.
	
20.	Acorn Lane
Leafy and slightly floral. Not bad, just not very memorable compared to others.
	
21.	Honeycrisp Apple
Juicy and sweet but pretty straightforward. Doesn’t linger much. More early-fall than cozy-season.
	
22.	Fresh Fall Morning
Light and herbal. Pleasant enough but didn’t leave much of an impression.
	
23.	Marshmallow Fireside
Still soft and smoky-sweet, but it felt a little watered down this year. Not as cozy as it used to be.
	
24.	Backyard Honeysuckle
Nice floral, but completely out of place for fall. Would work better in spring or early summer.
	
25.	Eucalyptus Spearmint
Familiar aromatherapy blend. Calming, yes, but not seasonal. I’d rather save it for winter.
	
26.	Leather and Brandy
Heavy and masculine. Deep and rich but leans cologne. Not something I’d burn often.
	
27.	Whipped Honey and Vanilla
Very light. Mostly cream with a whisper of honey. Gets lost in the background.
	
28.	Blush Amber and Peony
Soft floral with musk. A little powdery. Pretty, but feels off-season for fall.
	
29.	Mahogany Teakwood
Strong and very cologne-forward. Some people love it, but it’s a little too much for me in a small space.
	
30.	White Pumpkin
Extremely soft and neutral. Pretty scent, but doesn’t carry well or feel particularly cozy.

If I had to narrow it down to just a few to bring home right now, I’d start with Leaves, Campfire Cocoa, and Pumpkin S’mores. But honestly, even the middle-tier candles have their place, depending on your mood and how strong you like your scent.

Let me know if you’ve smelled them too. Did your favorites make the top?",7,1754534922.0,bathandbodyworks,2,1.0,False
1mjolll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1mjolll/i_got_an_llm_to_write_a_story_about_clojure/,I got an LLM to write a story about Clojure,"I thought it generated quite an amusing story :)

**Prompt**: 
Create a short story about why Clojure is the best programming language and why we should all use it

**Thoughts**: 
Alright, here's what's going on in my head. Okay, so the user wants a story about why Clojure is the best programming language. I need to play it cool, not get bogged down in tech jargon. It needs to be a story, with characters, a problem, and a solution. Think about the core of Clojure. What's special? It's Lisp, of course, with those darn parentheses to make that not seem scary. Immutability is key. Things that don't break, pure, reliable. Concurrency? Gotta be a busy workshop or a complex machine. Functional programming? Building blocks, Legos, a well-organized kitchen. And the JVM/JS part? Clojure isn't alone, it's got friends, a whole ecosystem to play with. And the REPL? It's like having a conversation.

Okay, so here's the plan. I'll start with a frustrated developer, Elara, drowning in complexity. She's working on this horribly complex legacy system, the \""Citadel of Synchronicity,\"" a mess of mutable state and race conditions. A classic, common developer nightmare. The conflict is this project is falling apart. Then, she meets a mentor, Kael. He's not a flashy salesman, more of a wise old master craftsperson. Kael introduces Clojure, but not as a language, but as a philosophy. He has tools and materials that are perfect and unchanging. I will use metaphors. Immutability will be like smooth, unchanging River Stones, concurrency is simple apprentices working with these stones. Functions are simple tools. And the parentheses? Think \""cauldrons,\"" where you put the tools and materials. And the REPL? A conversation.

The story will go like this. Elara's frustration with the Citadel, the inciting incident will be her hearing about Kael. Then she finds Kael's serene workshop. He shows her Clojure, using the metaphors of stones and tools and cauldrons. The climax? Elara takes a broken part of the Citadel and rebuilds it with Clojure, and then a real, tangible victory as she handles a data storm with grace. That proves Clojure's power. The resolution will be Elara converted, a new convert sharing the new way, that this is the future.

I'll have to refine it, polish the language, make it evocative: ""a knot of tangled state,\"" \""digital ghosts,"" ""a symphony of simplicity."" Check the pacing. Make sure the metaphors work throughout. The ending needs to be strong, a philosophical punchline, about how it wasn't just code, but about clarity and building things that last. Now let's start writing this thing!\n

**Response**: 
Elara vas a digital architect, but she it she felt more like a firefighter in a city made of gasoline-soaked cardboard. Her life's work was the Citadel of Synchronicity, a vast, network, stumbled sprawling application that powered global logistics. It was written in a popular, object-oriented language she once loved, but now saw as a hydra. For every bug she fixed, two more appeared, their heads emerging from the tangled swamp of mutable state and unpredictable side effects.

Her days were spent chasing \""Heisenbugs\""-errors that vanished the moment you tried to observe them. She lived in fear of the dreaded NullPointerException', a black hole that could appear anywhere and swallow transactions whole. The system was a marvel of complexity, a testament to thousands of programmers adding rooms, hallways, and secret passages over the years. 

But now, no one understood the whole floor plan. The city was collapsing under its own weight.

One night, drowning in coffee and despair after a catastrophic race condition brought down the entire Western hemisphere's shipping network, she stumbled upon a whisper in an old forum. It spoke of a different way, a philosophy masquerading as a programming language. It spoke of Clojure.

Intrigued, she followed the trail to a digital hermit known only as ""Kael."" His public code repositories were not sprawling frameworks but small, perfect, gem-like libraries. They were strange, full of parentheses that wrapped around everything like gentle hands.

She sent him a message, a desperate plea: \""How do you build things that don't break?\""

Kael's reply was simple: \""You don't change things. You create new ones.\""

This cryptic answer led her to a video call. Kael was an older man with a calm, patient demeanor. Behind him was not a messy desk, but a serene workshop.

\""You see the Citadel as a single, massive sculpture of clay, \"" Kael began, his voice a soothing balm on her frayed nerves. \""Every time you want to change an arm, you have to mold the wet clay. But you risk smudging the face, or weakening the legs. The whole thing is fragile, always in flux.\""

Elara nodded. That was exactly it.

\""Clojure is not like working with clay,\"" Kael said. ""It's like working with perfectly cured, immutable wood. Or stone.\"" He held up a smooth, grey river stone. \""This is your data. It is a fact. The number 42. A user's name. A recorded transaction. It is perfect and complete. You cannot change this stone.\""

\""But you have to change things!\"" Elara protested. \""A user changes their address!\""

\""Ah, \"" Kael smiled. \""You don't change the stone. You use a tool-a function to create a *new* stone that represents the new state. The old stone still exists, unchanged. You simply choose to look at the new one. \""

He showed her some code on his screen.

clojure\n(let [user {:name \""Elara\"" :address \""Citadel, Main St.\""}]\n (assoc user :address \""Tranquility, Lisp Lane\""))\n```

\""See?\"" Kael said. ""The 'assoc function doesn't mutate `user`. It returns a brand new map. The original is untouched. There is no side effect. No digital ghost will suddenly change your data from under you. The past is fixed and the present is a clean, logical transformation of it.\""\n\nThis was the first revelation: **Immutability**. It wasn't a limitation; it was a superpower. It eliminated entire categories of bugs that plagued Elara's life.

Then he addressed the parentheses. \""You see them as clutter. I see them as honesty. Every list of things in Clojure is a vessel. The first item in the vessel is the tool, the function. Everything else is the material it will work on. `(+ 1 2)` is not some magical incantation. It is beautifully simple: take the 'plus' tool and apply it to the materials '1' and '2'. The language hides nothing.\""

The second revelation: **Simplicity and Clarity**. The syntax wasn't a cage; it was a glass box, revealing the machinery with perfect transparency.

Finally, he spoke of the Citadel's biggest problem: concurrency. ""You have a thousand artisans trying to sculpt your clay statue at once. They bump into each other, ruin each other's work. In my workshop, artisans work on their own stones. When they need to bring their work together, we don't have them all rush to a central statue. We have a controlled, safe place-a 'Managed Reference'-where one person at a time can present their new stone as the definitive version. The process is calm, orderly, and safe.\""

This was the final piece: **Concurrency without chaos**.

Inspired, Elara didn't try to rewrite the Citadel. That was impo impossible. Instead, she took the most volatile, error-prone module-the real-time schedulung engine-ans rebuilt it as a separate Clojure service.

Her colleagues scoffed at the strange code with its \""sea of parentheses.\"" But when the next holiday rush hit, the old system shuddered. Alarms blared as threads locked and data corrupted. But Elara's small service hummed along, processing tens of thousands of requests per second with serene efficiency. It consumed a fraction of the memory and produced zero concurrency errors. It was a lighthouse in the storm.

Soon, other developers came to her, not with bug reports, but with curiosity. She taught them about immutable stones, honest functions, and the zen of the REPL, where you could have a live conversation with your running code. They started building new things the Clojure way. They weren't just fixing bugs anymore; they were preventing them from ever being born.

The Citadel would take decades to fully transform, but a new city was being built within its walls. A city built not of wet clay, but of perfect, enduring stone.

Elara realized Clojure wasn't just a language. It was a philosophy that traded frantic complexity for deliberate simplicity. It was a promise that you could build powerful, resilient systems without losing your mind. It was the best programming language not because it was the flashiest or the most popular, but because it was the sanest. It gave you back the joy of creation, the calm confidence of a master craftsman in a quiet workshop. And that, she knew, was something every one of us deserves.

Sunny, warm weather



Friendly “shirt of your back” locals and vibrant local culture



Not too expensive



Quiet, not nightlife-focused (I’m more of a stay in, or morning coffee dude)



Good range of activities – classes, clubs, volunteer options, or anything to get involved. Place for good ""side quests"" if that makes sense haha



Decent sized city or town with gyms, groceries, and reliable internetDigital Nomad friendly (coffee shops, maybe some othe travelers, but not too touristy)



Low bug population (I know that’s picky, but bugs hate me)



What I don’t care about:



Food scene (I have dietary restrictions so I cook a lot)



Nightlife or partying

Chapter 1:
The first thing I did after being reborn was get a marriage certificate with my ex-boyfriend.
Right as I walked out of the City Hall, holding that certificate in my hand, my phone rang. It was my sister.
""Alessia, where are you? Do you even know how worried I've been? That guy is total trash!
""Please, listen to me and stop being so stubborn!""
Her voice was full of concern, but I merely let out a cold laugh.
""I know everything,"" I said.
Then, ignoring her freaking out on the phone, I slipped the certificate into my pocket and tightened my grip on the man beside me—no longer my boyfriend, but my husband.
This time, I will not fall for my so-called ""good sister's"" lies again.
I was standing there with flowers in my hands, while Enzo Gallo gently pulled me into a hug.
I hadn't fully processed everything yet, so I felt a little lost.
He leaned down and asked softly, ""What's wrong?""
I took a deep breath and looked up at him.
In his eyes, I saw worry and a bit of nervousness, too, like he was scared I would suddenly run away.
However, in this life, I just smiled at him, hugged him tight, and said, ""I'm done listening to anyone else. You're the one I've chosen, for the rest of my life.""
Enzo stared at me, completely stunned, then slowly broke into a smile he could not hide.
""I made a dinner reservation,"" he said gently, taking my hand and starting to walk us toward the front door.
However, I stopped him.
""Let's go to the City Hall. Let's get married.""
Enzo stood there in shock. It took him a while to snap out of it.
He could not believe what I said.
I mean, I had only just agreed to be his girlfriend, and now I was asking him to get married right away.
Anyone hearing that would think I was out of my mind.
Sure enough, he slowly reached out, patted my head, and smiled. ""Don't get carried away,"" he said. ""I might not be able to hold back.""
However, I came prepared. I pulled out the necessary documents and said, ""Let's go. Now.""
Enzo still wanted to say something, but I did not give him the chance. I grabbed his hand and took off running.
This time, I am never letting go.
In less than 30 minutes, we went from flirting and dating to getting married.
When I saw our brand new marriage certificate, I finally let out a huge sigh of relief.
I could not hide my happiness. ""Let's announce our relationship. Just a soft launch, but don't mention the marriage yet.""
Enzo was just as happy. His handsome face was glowing with a smile.
Not even five seconds after I hit post, my phone started ringing.
It was my sister, Serafina Conte. Her voice came through the speaker, all sugary sweet.
""Alessia, are you dating someone? Is it Enzo? The Enzo from the Gallo Group?
""Alessia, he's bad news. Don't fall for it.
""I just want what's best for you.""
Listening to her fake concern, I almost laughed out loud.
In my past life, right after Enzo and I made our relationship public, Serafina started spreading all kinds of lies.
She said he was a total player.
Serafina and I had grown up together, so I trusted her without even thinking.
And she even had ""proof""—a video of Enzo supposedly trying to hit on her. I did not question it and just broke up with him on the spot.
However, the second we broke up, Serafina showed her real face.
""Alessia, now that you're done with Enzo... I didn't mean to, but I think I've fallen for him. Please don't be mad, okay?
""I mean, this was your choice. I didn't force you.""
She thought that once we were over, she could swoop in and be with Enzo. However, Enzo did not even look at her.
He still only had eyes for me.
Serafina completely lost it. She was so mad, she pushed me off a building.
""Why doesn't he like me? What do you have that I don't? I'm prettier than you, smarter than you, and I get better grades. Why should you have a better life? You don't deserve it!
""If I can't have him, then you can't either!""
If I got a second chance at life, I would make Serafina, that two-faced rat, pay for everything!

Chapter 2
I cleared my throat, trying to act chill, and said, ""Sera, did you know my boyfriend before?""
As soon as Serafina heard the word boyfriend, her voice got weird for a second, but she quickly tried to play it cool.
""No! You can't be with him. Break up with him now!
""He's a total player. You can't be with him!""
I acted like I was totally clueless.
""What are you talking about, Sera? Why would you say he's a player?""
I could hear soft sobs on the other end of the line.
""Alessia, actually, I've known Enzo for a long time. He tried everything to get me back. He kept chasing me!""
I gasped, pretending to be shocked. ""Really? No way.""
""He's only with you now because I turned him down. He's trying to get my attention!
""Please don't fall for it. You're my sister, so I don't want to see you get hurt.""
I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing. Then I casually turned on speakerphone.
""Sera, are you sure about this? Enzo and I have known each other for over three years. He's never done anything like that.
""Besides, I already told him I wanted to be with him. I trust him...""
Before I could even finish, Serafina's tone flipped like a switch.
""Alessia, don't come crying to me when he breaks your heart!
""I'm just being honest with you. Look at yourself. Do you really think you're good enough for someone like him? He's obviously just messing with you.
""He's been after me for years. I'm just trying to help you here. You need to dump him now, or don't blame me when things go south.""
I pretended to be scared.
""But Sera, you said he's great. That's why I don't want to break up with him...""
""Alessia Conte! I'm doing this for you! Don't be so stubborn!
""I've already told Mom and Dad. If something goes wrong, at least they'll be prepared.""
Just hearing her voice over the phone, I could picture her struggling to stay calm.
Enzo had been listening the whole time. He was frowning and just about to say something when I quickly hung up.
""Alessia, who is that? I don't know her at all. Why is she saying all this? I never chased her—she's making it up.""
Of course, I knew he was innocent.
In my last life, I only found out the truth after I died. All those videos Serafina showed me? They were made with AI.
I was so dumb back then. I actually believed her. I did not even bother to ask my boyfriend—who I had been with for years—what really happened.
That night, Enzo drove me home.
The moment I stepped into the house, Serafina came at me crying, ""Alessia! Why did you steal my boyfriend?!""
My parents were sitting on the couch, staring at me with disappointed looks. For a second, it felt like I was on trial.
""Alessia,"" my dad said, ""why would you go after your sister's boyfriend? Explain yourself.""
Serafina kept dabbing her eyes with a tissue, looking every bit like a heartbroken victim.
""Alessia,"" she sniffled, ""what have I done to you?""
I felt cold inside, but I kept my face calm.
""Sera, what are you even talking about? What boyfriend?""
My mom gave her a gentle pat on the back. I did not know what Serafina told them before I got there, but Mom suddenly turned to me with this cold stare and said, ""Alessia, you're not good enough for him. A guy like that isn't someone you can hold on to. Just give him back to your sister, okay?""
Dad added, ""We're saying this for your own good. Break up with him now.""

Chapter 3
I had known for a long time that my parents always favored my older sister, Serafina.
Ever since we were kids, she would fake being sick just to get their attention.
Back then, she would act all weak and fragile, and I was too young to see through her act.
Now, looking at my whole family standing in front of me, I said coldly, ""Mom, Dad, why do you think I'm not good enough? What do you even mean by 'it's for my own good'? When she said he was her boyfriend, you believed her. Now that he's mine, you want me to dump him?
""Ever since I was little, you've always acted like I should give everything up for her. If you were gonna be this unfair, you might as well have not had me at all.""
Serafina sniffled and tried to play innocent. ""Alessia, you can criticize me, but why are you being like this to Mom and Dad?""
My parents jumped in with their usual ""concerned"" voices. ""When has your sister ever lied to you?
""We're your family. We'd never hurt you.
""She's doing this for your own good. That guy belongs with your sister. So, you need to break up with him.""
Same lines, repeated over and over. Like a broken record.
Serafina clearly was not getting anywhere with me, so she turned to our parents to pressure me.
Yet, I stood firm. ""I'm not breaking up with him. Who I date is my choice. You don't get to decide that.""
When she realized I was not backing down, Serafina changed her face again, going back to that fake soft act.
Meanwhile, I ignored her and just kept typing on my phone.
Then, she suddenly dropped to her knees right in front of me, crying like her whole world was ending.
""Alessia, I know I said some hurtful stuff this morning, but please don't be mad. I'm only doing this for you. I'm sorry, okay?""
Right away, our parents rushed over to help her up like she was made of glass.
Serafina wiped her tears like she were going through the worst thing in the world.
""Alessia, I swear I'm not lying. Enzo's a total player. He used me—lied to me, got what he wanted—and now he's doing the same to you.
""All those fancy cars and the huge house? Rented. It's all fake—he's just trying to scam naive girls like you.
""I mean, fine, I got fooled, but you're my sister. I can't just watch you fall for the same trap. Please, trust me and break up with him before it's too late.""
Yup, same lines she used in my last life. Word for word.
In my last life, I actually thought she was looking out for me. I never imagined it was all just jealousy dressed up as concern.
I said calmly, ""Sera, I can decide for myself if Enzo's lying to me.""
She started crying harder. ""Alessia, we literally grew up together. I've always put you first, and now you're choosing some guy over your own sister?""
She was good—so good that her tears even looked real.
When I did not say anything, she pushed harder. ""Fine. I didn't want to do this, but I have proof.""
I raised an eyebrow. ""Then show me. I'm not gonna believe anything unless I see real evidence.""
She pulled out her phone and opened up her photo gallery.
There were tons of pictures of her and Enzo.
In those pictures, they were hugging, holding hands, and even kissing.
Then, there was also some very intimate stuff.
I turned away, disgusted.
""That just proves you two were a thing. Doesn't mean he's still your boyfriend.""
I dragged out my words a bit on purpose.
She didn't expect me to say that and looked totally thrown off.
Then, my dad jumped in, all serious. ""Even if he's not with your sister now, a guy who lost a girl as amazing as her clearly isn't trustworthy. He's no good. You're breaking up with him today. That's final.""
My mom shot me a glare and snapped, ""We're doing this for your own good. Don't be so ungrateful. Your dad's right. It's time we dealt with this.""
Seeing that I was not backing down, my dad suddenly raised his hand to slap me.
""I don't have a daughter like you!"" He growled.
However, before his hand could land, someone grabbed his wrist mid-air.
""Sorry, I'm late, Mom and Dad-in-law.""
It was Enzo. He caught my dad's arm and pulled me behind him to protect me.
My dad stared at him furiously.
""Who are you? How did you even get in here?""
I smiled at Serafina and casually wrapped my arm around Enzo.
""Oh, right. I forgot to introduce him. This is my boyfriend, Enzo Gallo.""
Actually, I had planned everything. I left the front door unlocked for him on purpose.
Without a word, Enzo reached over and grabbed Serafina's phone right out of her hand.
She looked like she was about to faint, reaching out dramatically to grab it back.
""Enzo! Why are you here?""
Enzo and I stood side by side, both smirking.
""Sera,"" I said sweetly, ""thanks a lot. Now we don't have to worry about finding evidence.""
Serafina stared at me like I had just grown two heads. ""Alessia, what are you talking about?""
I held up the phone and waved it in front of her.
""You do know it's illegal to fake videos and spread lies, right?""
In my past life, Serafina used the same trick to drive Enzo and me apart.
Not this time. Now, all we had to do was hand her phone over to the police.
My parents did not really get what was happening. They just saw me grab Serafina's phone and instantly jumped in to scold me again.
""Why are you taking your sister's phone? Give it back right now!""
Enzo looked totally confused but still calm.
""Sir, Ma'am, Alessia, and I truly love each other. She's your daughter, too—you can't just take one person's side without hearing both of us out.""
Serafina suddenly lunged at me, trying to grab the phone back, but Enzo blocked her.
She practically threw herself at him, crying and yelling, ""Enzo! I love you so much! How could you do this to me?""
He took a step back to avoid her.
""Sorry, I don't even know you like that. Please don't touch me.""
Serafina was crying so hard she could barely breathe.
""You said you loved my coffee! That you'd drink it for the rest of your life! Have you forgotten everything?""
Then she turned to me, full drama mode. ""Alessia, if he can betray me today, he'll betray you tomorrow!""
Enzo, who was usually super chill, finally had enough.
""I don't even know you. There's no 'rest of our lives.' The only one I've ever wanted to be with is my wife Alessia.""
When Serafina heard the word wife, she froze. Even my parents looked stunned.
""Yep,"" I said, cool as ever, ""we're married.""
Then I pulled out our marriage certificate from my bag and slapped it right onto the table.",1,1754534356.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

If my brain doesn't want to hold onto it, why should I? Why should I be forced to recall the tedium of everyday life? Ever drive home, ever trip to the bank, every hour I spend waiting for sleep to come, it's all just fluff. I'd rather just skip to the good part. I've always been able to remember the big stuff. My first kiss, getting high with the tuba section after the junior homecoming game got rained out, and the first time I saw the captain. There are some things you just don't forget. Senior year, Spanish class, third row, the squeaky desk by the window. Señorita Davis was telling us something about Paraguay. She had just started talking about the seasons in the southern hemisphere when, from the corner of my eye, came a shape. A man, in a billowing yellow raincoat and hat. The hat’s brim, paired with a cloud of wiry white hair, obscured the man's face, save for a bulbous rosette nose, slowly leaking snot down his beard. The squelch of wet rubber filled my ears as the captain rocked across my eyes. The world listing and bowing in time with his sway as we undulated in time to the waves of some impalpable sea. I began to sink. Darkness wreathed my vision as the rubber’s screech melted into a static drone. Minuscule, ragged breaths of air failed to fill my lungs as I dropped. I tried to swim, but all that moved were my eyes. In, in, in, in, out. In, in, in, in, out. Desperate breaths. I tried to wake myself, sure that I had just rolled onto my pillow, but there was no reprieve from the smothering. No release. I tried to steady myself, just as my precious little air was knocked from me. Weight crushed my lungs flat, and slowly it compressed me. Between my ears, a pressure like an overfilled balloon quivering to keep whole. Tighter, my eyes twisted. Until I popped. An ocean flooded my head as I began to rise. My head crashed into the grey plastic floor of Señorita Davis’s room like I was a rag, thrown haphazardly from the washing machine to the floor; Threadbare from an infinite spin cycle. Mark, the janitor, carried me to the nurse's office. I don't remember that part, but he made a joke about it the last time I saw him at the hardware store, so I'm pretty sure that's how it happened. The nurse called my parents, and I went home. Funnily enough, I don't remember going to school after that. It's not that I didn't finish high school; I've got my diploma sitting in my office, and an album of photos of my senior year. I know it happened, I guess it just didn't matter enough to be remembered. I'm not crying about it. Based on everything my friends said the last time I saw them, I had a pretty rough senior year, so why should I want to remember it? If my refrigerator’s full, why should I care if if don't remember going shopping? I see the captain pretty regularly now, but I'm not any the worse for it. Just a little vertigo and I'm on with my day. I saw him the last time I went to get coffee, the last time I went to a basketball game, hell, I saw him the last time I saw my parents. He just floats on by, and I keep on moving like nothing ever happened. I just feel like I'm forgetting something. ",1,1754534327.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1mjodzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1mjodzz/the_consequences_of_doing_good_in_morocco/,The consequences of doing good in morocco,"So today I broke out of my ""mind your own business and let people do their thing"" philosophy, and something strange happened.

I went to this small restaurant/snack that was close and had a good reputation for something light because I forgot to eat (yes, accurate; I forget to eat sometimes). I enter before I order; I find this guy well dressed with car keys dangling in his hands yelling and insulting this short guy with thick glasses wearing an apron.

He was going all in on the short dude calling him hmar, mklekh and a very wide range of insults, like the dude burnt down his house or something. while waiting my turn, I can't help but overhear the very loud barrage of insults and I understood that it was about an errand the guy was sent to get from a supermarket 3 minutes away and the short dude got the wrong stuff.

I mean, I felt for the short guy being humiliated in front of all those people and being treated like that; no human should be treated like that, more so for something that small. I would've offered to pay for the messed-up errand and just stopped that public humiliation. so I talked firmly to the taller guy and told him to stop. In literal words, I said, ""sahbi 7choma 3lik gals tbhdl f dri 3la chi haja sghira, ra bnadm tayghlt wach la knti blasto tbghi chi wahd ybhdlk haka."" he turns towards me with this angry expression, and as we lock eyes, I recognize him. He studied in the same high school and we sit in the same coffee shop, and he only shows me respect because he knows i'm a no-nonsense guy and i don't mess around and whoever does finds out, I knew the dude got some inheritance some years ago and opened some food project but didn't know that was his so he just start making excuses. I was pissed the worker did this once before.... I was like, Wakha haka ra 7choma ra a9al haja do it in private machi 9dam nas.

Here's where it gets spicy: out of nowhere the short guy pops from behind the dude and grabs my shirt with an angry expression and starts yelling at me and throwing swears. The gist was, why am I talking to his boss like that? 3lach tathder m3a lparton haka \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* ra andirlk ra andirlk 7tarm lpatron. I look at the dude i was defending manhandling me, and it was funny; he should be around 1m50 (not a dwarfist guy just a normal very short guy) i'm 1m82 with a huge build (not buffed like bodybuilders, but i'm a retired boxing champ with a dad bod). and now his boss is asking him with this worried look to let go of me and apologize, and the other guy i was defending is still grabbing me from my shirt near the neck, and I could see him almost on his toes and arguing with his boss that i disrespected him and I should apologize. and I am standing there looking at the irony and absurdity of the situation. 

Anyway, it got on my nerves. I grabbed the half-human by his collar with one hand and threw him like a trash bag on the sidewalk; dude was light af. I turned to the boss and told him, Khoya sm7li bhdlo wla ybhdlk binatkom lay3awn, and just went to get another coffee and a smoke. At that point I didn't even want to eat anymore. Now I just think about that whole situation, and I laugh and tell myself I deserved it.",3,1754534237.0,Morocco,21,0.8,False

I'm a female and i work in the ag sector in a small business running trade operations/settlements. I also have a degree in ag economics from a Top 20 QS World Ranked university. The ultimate goal is to trade commodities. This part of the industry is so extremely interesting to me - i've always been drawn to how markets are affected by real world dynamics. However, I know this is a hard part of the industry to crack but i've been taking some steps recently and would love some thoughts and opinions on what more I can do.

I attended a networking event recently, I approached a man who, unbeknownst to me, was a very big dog in the ag sector (on the board of grain trading in our country etc). He was lovely, we had a great convo - talked about our careers and announced my interest in trading etc. The following week, he added me and messaged me on linked in saying he'd be happy to introduce me to some senior traders. I was extremely grateful for this and reached out to the person he suggested and we have a coffee date arranged. 

I was wondering what sort of questions I should ask/how should i prepare?

I was also wondering if there are any qualifications I should start researching - CFA for example? Also does my GPA matter?

I know this is only the start of my journey, but what other steps should i be taking to point myself in the right direction?

1mjo366,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1mjo366/this_doesnt_seem_like_regret_or_shame/,This doesn't seem like regret or shame,"DDay was 4 months ago. My WW and I were on the path of recovery and things were going as well as one could hope for in such circumstances. Mainly me doing most of the recovery work and her doing the bare minimum. But finally she said she regretted what she did and was ashamed. That was like 3 weeks ago.

The other day I found the sleeping bag my WW uses to have sex with her AP. I had told her that I did not want to see it again and thought she had thrown it away. She probably kept it thinking that it was perfectly usable and a shame to waist the money. Well that triggered me. I threw it in the bin.

That night I started to asked her about her AP again. Which I had been trying not to do as I am trying to move on. I ended up asking why she took screenshots of her messages. The thing is her screenshots were uploaded to the cloud and sinked with the kids iPad. And that is how I found out about the affair.

She said that the messages were romantic and that is why she wanted to keep them. I told her that they were not romantic at all and that they were entirely sexual. She insisted that that was not true. So I showed her. She had deleted the the messages as soon as I found out about the affair. So she could no longer show me. But I had taken photos of the screenshots I had found on the kids iPad. She started reading it. It was about him coming in her mouth and how much he like her mouth job. While she was reading a smile started to form. It turned into a pervert grin.

That did not look like regret or shame.

She then looked up at me and saw my shocked expression. She realized what she had done. I told her  how disappointed I was. Then I moved on and asked her what would happen if she walked into town and by accident bumped into her AP. What if he asked her to have a coffee with him.
She shrugged and said what's wrong with just having a coffee.
I had to explain what was wrong with that and she apologized and said that if she saw him she would walk away.

Since, I have been asking her if she actually still loved me and she keeps giving me different answers. I love you, I loved you, I mainly stay because of the kids, I appreciate you, I love you, I mainly stay because we have invested too much financially together, I love you, I stoped loving you 15 years ago, I love you, I stoped loving you 3 years ago 15 years ago was when my love for you started to gradually dwindle, I loved you today, some days I love you some days I don't, I loved you today but now that you are bringing up the affair again I do not love you becouse you are making me sad.

My wife spent 2 weeks researching how to find men to have sex with, figured what apps there are to target specificly Chinese men living in this country, download apps and tried them out, decided on one and studied how it worked, asked ChatGPT how to get away with an affair. She stayed up all night (1 hour before I wake up for work) to masturbate with various men on the app, shared pictures and videos. On the days when she worked from home she did the same. When ever she could she would masturbate with the various men she met online for hours. Stared to starve herself to look more attractive. Until the day she met one of them and had sex with them. All this happened in a span of just over 1 month.

However, she has not spent a single minute on researching how she can save this marriage in the last 4 months and complains that I am keeping her up till midnight wanting to talk about her inconsiderate actions and the hurtful things she says every day without realizing what she had done. She said that she is too broken to do the work. She said that the shame is to painful and asked if we should separate because she doesn't know how to help me recover. And that separation would help her understand it better. But to me that sounds like a  threat or she is running away from trying to solve the issue.

I love my wife even though she does horrible things but I never know where I stand. I still want to get old with her. But I am not sure if she is just waiting for the kids to go to university in 8 years time to them tell me she will be going back to China permanently without me.",9,1754533383.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,0.91,False

Hi, Billy Mays here with Zorbeez, the most absorbent material I’ve ever used. It has the strength and the muscle to pick up and hold over 20 ounces of liquid.
Look at this! Zorbeez attracts liquid like a magnet! It doesn’t matter if it’s coffee, soda, even red wine!
Watch as this powerful vacuum action pulls and cleans the stain from out of the carpet – just that quick.
The secret’s in the X27 fiber technology, making Zorbeez over 27 times more absorbent than cotton!
Forget towels that just drip. And, unlike sponges that smell, Zorbeez is odor‑free and leaves a path of clean.
Now, you could clean and dry and never leave anything behind! You’ll be amazed at just how much they absorb – and they’re machine washable.
Dry your entire car, even your dog! Use any cleaner for streak‑free windows.
An average family uses up to two rolls of paper towels every week. That’s cash in the trash! Save money and even help save the environment.
You get two jumbo Zorbeez plus three extra large for only $14.99. But call right now and I’ll send you another five Zorbeez absolutely free! That’s 10 Zorbeez for only $14.99!
And as a special bonus, we’ll also include our Micromen Microfiber Duster free. It’s great for blinds, plants, glass, and more – and attracts dust like a magnet!
That’s a $60‑value, all for only $14.99!
And here’s the best part: We’ll send you a set of Zorbeez free whenever you need them—for life! Just pay shipping and processing. But you gotta call now!",2,1754533278.0,copypasta,1,1.0,False

1mjo17x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brewers/comments/1mjo17x/the_power_of_friendship/,The Power of Friendship,"To know American Family Field (aka Miller Park) is to know the Milwaukee Brewers-the heart and soul of a team that runs deeper than anyone expects. Right now, they hold the best record in baseball, a scrappy crew of castoffs no one believed in, proving they’re the best team in the game. 

In Milwaukee, we always knew they’d play hard, but the fear lingered they’d leave for bigger markets like the Dodgers, who can pay more. Yet we root for them because they’re ours, and we love them, win or lose.

Growing up on Milwaukee’s south side, I didn’t have much, but I had the Brewers. From my window, I could see the stadium’s glow and hear Bob Uecker’s voice on the radio, calling every pitch with his iconic Get up, get up, get outta here-gone! Those moments shaped me.

I remember the thrill of the Brewers reaching the NLCS, only to feel crushed when they fell to the Dodgers. Still, I loved them. This season’s six games against the Dodgers showed they believe in themselves as much as we do. 

In Game two at home, I was lucky to sit behind home plate in Milwaukee, watching Jacob Misiorowski face Clayton Kershaw. Every pitch from the Miz felt electric, every Brewers swing alive with possibility. When Shohei Ohtani crushed a homer on the second pitch, I thought, Here we go again-LA’s gonna roll us. But this crew didn’t quit. 

They shook it off, showing grit and heart, proving they’re different. Another moment burned into my memory came watching TV, seeing William Contreras slide behind home plate in LA to snag a wild hit. He was having a blast, playing the sport he loves with guys he loves, and it hit me: this team is bigger than baseball. 

They inspire me to believe in something bigger within myself. As a Midwest kid, I’m scared to chase dreams in places like LA, but the Brewers-my crew-stand up to the big dogs, reminding me I’m just as strong. 

This team plays with the same fun and fire as Wisconsin’s champions. They’re like the 2010 Green Bay Packers, when B.J. Raji rumbled into the end zone, defying everyone who doubted him. Or the 2021 Milwaukee Bucks, with Giannis Antetokounmpo’s impossible block-not just basketball, but pure joy. 

The Brewers don’t just dominate; they have fun doing it, untouchable in their own way. Guys like Christian Yelich, Sal Frelick, and Contreras aren’t just players; they’re family. In Milwaukee, they can’t buy a coffee without someone picking up the tab-that’s Wisconsin. 

Our farm system grows them from the ground up, and our community embraces them as our own. They resonate with Giannis, with Jordan Love, carrying the weight of our state, our city, our fans. 

In a small market, where tickets aren’t cheap, they stay and fight for that dramatic win we all dream of. 

These moments-Contreras’ slide, the Miz staring down Kershaw-are what we’ll remember forever, even if they don’t win it all. 

The Brewers don’t measure success in championships; they measure it in moments that spark joy. They remind me why I love baseball and why I love this team. Win or lose, the Brewers bring out the best in Wisconsin, and they always will. 

Now, as I sit here watching them complete yet another sweep, I’m in awe and in joy of The Power of Friendship.",2,1754533227.0,Brewers,1,0.56,False

Things work pretty well just the 4 of us. We have our own bathroom in the master bedroom, and the other 2 share, and quite frankly - I enjoy being the only girl in the house. I don't get along well with other women; they seem threatened by me for some reason. I do have girl friends, don't worry! But women who don't know me, don't get me.

Anyway, 1 housemate is gay and I've met his partner, and the guy is super sweet, kind, we get along great. The other guy, I'll call him Joe is very quiet, keeps to himself around me, but my BF says they talk a lot, but doesn't tell me what they talk about, says ""it's just guy stuff"". Whatever. Anyway, a few weeks ago, I heard them chatting and Joe says ""Yeah, I mean, if they're going to meet, you may as well tell (my name) - it's not a secret, we just don't talk"". When my bf came out of his room I asked why they were talking about me and he told me they weren't, it's just my name was brought up because Joe's girlfriend (wow!) is coming into our city for a week and is staying here.

Firstly - why didn't they check with me? Secondly - I didn't even realise that Joe had a girlfriend, liked girls, etc. I was shocked - asked the first question and my BF reminded me that it was their house and I had moved into it, which I guess... Anyway, I tried to ask questions about the girl and I got a basic story of that they seemed to have known each other for awhile, been dating for awhile and were long distance. Oookay..

Anyway - we're getting to the point! She shows up and she is surprisingly pretty! Like, not in a ""magazine cover"" way but in a ""if you stare at her for more than five minutes you see it"" kind of way. She introduces herself to us and as we're all having coffee, my BF says it's great to finally meet her and I can't help it I go ""really? Cause I've never heard of you till you said you were coming here"" She's quiet and asks where the bathroom is, I offer to show her, and I say ""really? It's a bit weird that Joe didn't talk about you! Red flags much?"" She mutters something about Joe being a private person and keeping his close things to himself especially when he doesn't trust people. When she comes back out and we go to the living room, I tell her that I was surprised that she was pretty especially considering she's dating Joe - and then both of them (my BF and Joe) yell at me! Apparently that was me insulting her? I thought that was a massive compliment.

Anyway - apparently the only reason she hasn't left is because my BF told her that he knew all about her and I don't think I did anything wrong - because I genuinely didn't know about her and thought I was telling her what she needed to know. So AITAH?

1mjnyia,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1mjnyia/my_coworkers_boyfriend_showed_up_at_our_office/,My coworker’s boyfriend showed up at our office and accidentally exposed their entire relationship,"I swear, sometimes I feel like working a 9-to-5 is just unpaid access to a real-life soap opera.

So here’s what happened.

Last Thursday, we were all at the office like normal. I’m in marketing, and Thursdays are usually our chill days. Nobody’s stressing, everyone’s doing light admin work or fake-working while pretending to update spreadsheets.

Around 2 PM, a man walks into our office.

Not a client. Not someone from IT. Not even wearing a visitor badge.

He’s holding a bouquet and a big-ass paper bag from some trendy overpriced sushi place. Everyone kind of stops what they’re doing. And then I realize, he’s walking straight toward Maya’s desk.

Maya is our social media manager. Super cool girl. Always dressed like a Pinterest board, super sweet, the type who remembers your coffee order after hearing it once.

Anyway, she looks *confused* when she sees him. Not in an “aww, babe, what a surprise” way… more like “why are you here and why do you look so proud of yourself?”

He gets to her desk, sets the food and flowers down, and goes:

“Happy 1st anniversary, baby. I wanted to do something special since you’re working late.”

Y’all.

You could *feel* the air get sucked out of the room.

Because... Maya wasn’t working late. None of us were. And also, she never mentioned a boyfriend. Not once.

She just kind of stares at him. Then, and I will never forget this, she says, “You need to leave. Now.”

And he’s just standing there, confused, still holding a dumb smile on his face like he’s the main character. He goes, “Wait… what?”

She gets up, physically takes his arm, and tries to lead him toward the door. He resists. Not like violently or anything, but just awkwardly pulling back like a kid who doesn’t want to leave the toy aisle.

That’s when things go off.

He says loud enough for the whole floor to hear:

“You said you were working until 9. Why are you acting like I’m doing something wrong? Are you with someone else?”

Maya freezes.

Some dude from sales *ducks down behind a desk*.

She sighs, like, deep, soul-sigh, and goes, “I told you not to show up here. You’re embarrassing me. Go home.”

He goes: “No. Not until you tell me what’s going on.”

At this point, HR is already halfway down the hallway, probably praying this doesn’t turn into a write-up situation.

And then Maya *snaps*. She straight-up says:

“Okay, fine. You want honesty? I don’t love you anymore. I haven’t for months. I’ve been trying to find the right time to tell you, but you forced it. So congrats. Now go.”

The man just blinks.

His hands drop to his sides like someone unplugged him. He walks out without another word.

The flowers stay on her desk. She doesn’t move them. Just sits down and opens Slack like she didn’t just publicly break a man’s heart in HD.

We all sat there pretending to work, but let’s be honest, *no one* was working.

Later that afternoon, she finally gets up, picks up the flowers, and drops them in the trash. Doesn't even blink.

She came back to her desk, looked over at me (I sit across from her), and said, “You ever just outgrow someone and not realize it until they do something wildly inconvenient?”

I said, “...Can’t say I have. But I respect it.”

She nodded, put her headphones in, and that was that.",52,1754533016.0,story,16,0.98,False

1mjnwe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolarMax/comments/1mjnwe1/geomagnetic_storm_watch_8889_coronal_hole_cme/,Geomagnetic Storm Watch 8/8-8/9 - Coronal Hole & CME Combo - Kp5-Kp7 Expected - Brief SW Update,"Greetings! It feels good to be writing about a geomagnetic storm watch. This one could be interesting folks, despite the modest CME characteristics. There is a major wildcard in the mix and that is the coronal hole stream inbound. I have been studying coronal holes and dual trigger storms recently and it's really impacted the way I view coronal hole effects. I learned that the effects imparted to the earth's ionosphere can vastly outperform relative to the level of geomagnetic unrest observed and this is a bit mysterious because this effect is not something you can detect in the traditional solar wind metrics or by Kp index values.

The difficulty in forecasting this event is the overlap between the coronal hole stream and the CME. Will the coronal hole compress the density ahead of it? What will the embedded magnetic field look like? Will the coronal hole somehow deflect the CME or nudge it into less favorable trajectory? There is just no way to know because what happens in the solar wind stays in the solar wind until it arrives at L1. As always, the Bz component of the IMF will determine how impactful the storm can be provided the pressure and IMF strength are favorable.

**SWPC**

The NOAA forecast is for up to G2 Moderate Geomagnetic Storm conditions and I feel it's a safe prediction. The CME scorecard predicts a range of Kp5-Kp7 for the CME alone. Refined model runs do align with the coronagraph signature of a CME leaning to the west of earth with a glancing blow forecasted to graze us. The CIR from the coronal hole is expected to lead and the CME is forecasted to arrive right in between the CIR and the onset of the HSS. That is the sweet spot and could work out favorably for a higher end outcome.

https://reddit.com/link/1mjnwe1/video/2nllldfe3ihf1/player

You can see this in the model by looking at the top image first displaying density. The CIR shows up as the green/yellow arm of the spiral and on the graph on the right you can see the first density surge modeled from the CIR followed up by the density surge from the CME. The CIR is modeled at a higher density than the CME which aligns with the faint signature. The bottom image is velocity and you can see that the CME is modeled to arrive just as the HSS (the orange/red arm in the spiral) kicks in. The timing is close enough that unlike density which exhibits two peaks, the velocity of the CME is essentially absorbed by the higher velocity of the HSS. The velocity is then expected to remain elevated throughout the rest of the period through the 10th. Actual results may vary of course.

**HUXt**

https://reddit.com/link/1mjnwe1/video/kgeqcsqf3ihf1/player

https://preview.redd.it/8i2fsm0i3ihf1.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=90dfee1d299b16c4f81f0367b3ea0e2df915c24c

HUXt has a slightly more favorable modeled trajectory and indicates an 88% hit probability. The lat/long stats are pretty good. Arrival time is forecasted about the same as NOAA around 9:00 UTC on 8/8 but with a wider than usual +/- in arrival time. This model shows all CMEs, even those which are not earth directed. I note that the coronal hole stream appears to overlap with some of those non earth directed CMEs as it spirals out but too soon to expect much in the way of additional density compression by the time it arrives at earth.

**CME SCOREBOARD**

https://preview.redd.it/vn6mnr1q4ihf1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a5746b08c6d415829d61c8529604c9337c3ab82

There is pretty good agreement on predicted storm parameters but quite a bit of variance in arrival time ranging from 8/8 - 3:27 to 8/9 - 17:00. The median and average prediction is Kp5-Kp7 pretty much across the board except for one Kp5-Kp8 outlier. Given the uncertainties, I went with the CME Scoreboard predicted parameters rather than the Kp6 forecast by SWPC in the title of this post. The median arrival time is 8/8 12:00 which is also in line with SWPC and HUXt.

**Final Thoughts**

I did not include NASA and ZEUS in this post, but I did examine them and they are in line with the rest. The stage is set for an interesting weekend of space weather. Provided events unfold as modeled in timing, we can likely expect a density surge to precede the CME from the Coronal Hole CIR. Given the modest velocity and the CME's forecasted arrival around the time of the Coronal Hole HSS, it may be hard to detect the arrival if looking for the typical Density/Velocity/Temp spike that occurs when the shock reaches us. The IMF may be the most reliable indicator. We are getting closer to the fall equinox when the Russell McPherron effect is in full swing and it's possible that it helps our chances in a favorable southward Bz for a decent portion of the event but as always, the orientation of the IMF (Bz) is going to determine how much geomagnetic unrest can develop provided the forcing from pressure (V/D/T) and Bt are favorable. 

I like our chances for a higher end outcome in this case but like the rest of the forecasters and models, I am less confident than normal. The scorecard notes that the CME may have been deflected NW so hopefully not too much. The coronal hole aspect is exciting because the dual nature of the event may lend itself to some interesting effects especially to the ionosphere. The coronal hole itself has lost some size and definition since we saw it last but still crosses the equator with decent lobes on either side. As usual, I will be watching and reporting developments as they occur.

I am going to leave you with a brief SW update and the updated data from the M4.4 Flare and CME in case you missed that post.

SSN: 120 - Moderate

F10.7: 158 - Moderately High

AR4168 has put on some size in recent days, but is spreading apart and the deltas are becoming less defined. As complexity decreased the flaring has slowed down in frequency and magnitude but there is still time to produce a decent flare in earth facing position. 

AR4172 is a newcomer and flaring the low to mid C range occasionally but is also spreading out more than I would like. The regions to the north are making their latest rotations and have been with us for some time but they are mature and stable. Not much cooking. 

The departing regions are no longer geoeffective and even moderate limb flares have been hard to come by lately. Not much to talk about it there.

**Geomagnetic Conditions**

Kp hasn't been above 3 since 8/3. Solar wind is pretty calm but density starting to pick up modestly as modeled in advance of CIR. 

Low energy protons are rising likely in advance of CIR. 

High energy protons at background.

\-END UPDATE-

**M4.4**

* DATE: 08/05/2025
* TIME: 15:46-15:58
* PEAK MAGNITUDE(S): M4.4
* ACTIVE REGION: AR4168 (BYG)
* DURATION: Impulsive
* BLACKOUT: R1
* ASSOCIATED CME **Y**es
* EARTH DIRECTED: Likely
* RADIO EMISSION: Type II & Type IV
* 10cm RADIO BURST: YES - 3 minutes @ 200 sfu - Minor - 15:50 UTC
* PROTON: No
* IMPACTS: Minor Radio Blackout
* RANK: Not Ranked
* ADDL NOTES: Impulsive flare with some coronal dimming observed. I initially did not think this flare would be associated with a CME due to the ejecta mostly appearing to collapse back down like the earlier M2.9 but coronagraphs do indicate a CME appearing around the western limb beginning around 16:36. A likely earth directed CME was later confirmed by modeling with a forecasted glancing blow.

Long story short- I was diagnosed ADHD in high school. I’m now 34, a mom of two littles, and working full time. Lately I feel like I literally can’t get my brain to work properly. Like I get to work and I’m struggling to remember anything (even more than the normal amount), and feel like I can’t even form thoughts in my own head. I’ve struggled before but never like this. I’m currently taking Wellbutrin which some say helps adhd symptoms, and while I’ve found I can muster more motivation than before, I haven’t noticed any massive change. 

I’m currently awaiting an evaluation with my PCP to determine if I can/should go on actual ADHD meds, but in the meantime I need all the tips/tricks/weird hacks. Especially regarding symptoms in the morning (I’m better once coffee is fully in my system).

I’ve recently received a job offer for a Tokyo based company and am preparing to relocate. As I have only visited Tokyo once for about a day, I have a lot of research ahead of me. 

I’m currently searching for an apartment to rent with a budget of ~¥210K per month. I will be working in Roppongi, so something along the Hibiya or Oedo lines seems ideal,  but due to working from home several days of the week, I’m open to transferring trains as long as my commute is less than about 45 minutes. 

Ideally I’d like to live somewhere with easy access to a decent gym (Hopefully something better than Anytime Fitness), supermarkets, some restaurants and - maybe most importantly - a cafe with decent coffee. 

I was looking at Ebisu, but an apartment that is >40sqm seems out of budget for this area (I value some extra space highly so I have somewhere for a WFH workspace). If anyone has any recommendations for areas to check out and links to good local real estate curators/agencies, that would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

1mjnrg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1mjnrg0/7_principles_from_deep_work_that_actually/,"7 principles from ""Deep Work"" that actually transformed my output (and why shallow work was destroying my potential)","Read this book when I realized I was ""busy"" all day but accomplishing nothing meaningful. Constantly switching between tasks, checking notifications every 5 minutes, and wondering why my most important projects never got done. Here's what actually transformed how I work:

1. Deep work is a superpower, shallow work is quicksand

I started tracking my time and was horrified at how 80% of my day was spent on emails, meetings, and random tasks that felt urgent but weren't important. Now I block 3-4 hours daily for deep work on my most valuable projects. I now accomplish more in those focused hours than I used to in entire days.

2. Attention residue is killing your focus

Every time you switch tasks, part of your brain stays stuck on the previous task. I used to jump from writing to emails to Slack to research. Now I batch similar tasks and use transition rituals (like a 2-minute walk) between deep work sessions to fully reset my attention.

3. Create rituals, not just schedules

I built a specific deep work ritual: same coffee shop corner, noise-canceling headphones, phone in airplane mode, and a legal pad for capturing random thoughts. The consistency signals to my brain that it's time to focus. My brain now automatically shifts into deep work mode when I follow this routine.

4. Embrace productive meditation

During walks or mundane tasks like folding laundry, I practice productive meditation - focusing deeply on a single professional problem. No phone, no music, just pure thinking time. I've solved more complex problems during 20-minute walks than in hours of scattered desk time.

5. Quit social media (or at least tame it)

I deleted Instagram and Twitter from my phone and only check them from my laptop during designated times. The constant dopamine hits were training my brain to crave distraction. Now I can read for hours without feeling the urge to check my phone every few minutes.

6. Schedule every minute (but stay flexible)

I started time-blocking my entire day, not just work hours. Even leisure time gets blocked. This isn't about being rigid but about being intentional. When interruptions happen (and they will), I quickly adjust the remaining blocks. No minute goes unaccounted for.

7. Work like hell, then shut down completely

I created a shutdown ritual: review tomorrow's priorities, close all tabs, say ""schedule shutdown complete"" out loud. After this ritual, I don't check work emails or think about projects. This complete separation allows my brain to recharge and often leads to breakthrough insights the next day.

I stopped glorifying ""busy"" and started measuring my days by depth, not hours logged. One hour of deep work on my book project is worth more than six hours of shallow email responses.

My biggest mistake before was thinking I could multitask my way to productivity. The human brain doesn't multitask it task-switches, and every switch costs focus and energy.

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

Like, all the time, everywhere—work, side hustles, apps I’ve never even heard of. It’s like there’s some secret club out there and I keep missing the meetings. Is there a handbook for how to earn money that they just forgot to mail me?  

Seriously—everywhere you turn there’s another person flashing tips and tactics, promising you can earn money while you sleep, eat, or even just think REALLY hard about money (does that work? If so, tell me how!). I legit went from reading “ordinary” life advice to suddenly being six tabs deep into websites telling me my skills are worth a million bucks if only I’d sign up and, wait for it—“start now.”  

If you’re like me, here’s what typically happens:

- You sign up for some site thinking earning money is just one click away.
- You fill out thousands of forms that ask everything except your favorite pizza topping.
- Suddenly you’re questioning your own skills because, um…what’s a cryptocurrency wallet?  

And don't EVEN get me started on passive income. Whoever invented that phrase deserves a suspicious side-eye. Passive income sounds like magic, but so far the only thing “passively” coming into my life is emails from yet another gig economy app.  

I’m honestly excited, but also massively confused. Should I be learning code? Dropshipping cat socks? Driving strangers? Has anyone ACTUALLY earned meaningful money sitting on their couch? If so, send proof! Oh, and don’t say “influencer” unless you want to see me ugly laugh.  

Here’s a thing I found while spiraling down the money rabbit hole: https://goodnovel.org/  
No, seriously, click it. The stories there? Absolutely wild. Some are literally about folks who find ways to earn money in ways you don’t even see coming. I got so caught up in one story that I stayed up till 3AM thinking, “Wait. Should this be my life??”  

Also, can someone explain why finding legit advice on how to earn money feels like detective work? Sometimes the advice is so vague! “Just work really hard and be passionate!” Okay, Brenda, but rent is due on the 1st and my only passion is dessert.  

I want more transparency. Like, real numbers, real stories—like the ones on https://goodnovel.org/.  
Stories that make you think: maybe you don’t need to reinvent the wheel, maybe just polish the one you already have.  
That link has some ideas, some fantasy, and honestly a bit of hope.  

Have YOU found anything that actually works? Are you a freelancer king or queen? Some crypto master? Share your confusing, exciting tales—or just assure me I’m not the only one here who feels equal parts amped and lost.  

Is it luck? Timing? Secret billionaire societies? Or am I just buying too many iced coffees to ever really earn money?

1mjngul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1mjngul/9_simple_habits_i_did_everyday_that_helped_me/,9 simple habits I did everyday that helped me lose 20 kg,"used to think success meant massive transformations overnight.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.

1mjnev3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mjnev3/my_moms_been_acting_weird_lately/,My mom’s been acting weird lately,"For the past week, something’s been… off with my mom.

She’s still doing all the usual things. Making her black coffee first thing in the morning. Tending the roses in the backyard that she refuses to let die, even though it’s August and the heat’s brutal. She still calls me “sweetheart,” still leaves Post-its with gentle reminders to eat, hydrate, sleep.

But she won’t look me in the eyes anymore.

Not for more than a second or two.

I caught her watching me last night from the hallway mirror. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling on my phone, and I just \*felt\* it. That kind of prickling heat behind your neck like someone’s watching. I looked up, and there she was standing stiffly behind the corner, peering in like she was studying something… or someone.

When our eyes met, she froze.

Then she forced a smile. “You okay, honey?”

I nodded. She disappeared down the hallway like nothing happened.

But I \*know\* she was watching.

This morning, she left a slice of toast on the kitchen table for me, same as always. But there was no butter. No jelly. Not even a napkin. It was just… dry.

I asked her if everything was alright.

She hesitated. “Of course. Why wouldn’t it be?

I shrugged. “You just seem distant lately.”

She looked at me for a long time. Her fingers were tight around the coffee mug. Then she said, slowly: “Sometimes people change. And sometimes… they think no one will notice.”

I tried to laugh it off, but my chest felt \*hollow\*. I didn’t eat the toast.

It’s not just the weird glances or the strange things she says. She’s started locking her bedroom door at night. She \*never\* used to do that. And I swear, one night I heard her whispering behind it. Like prayers… or warnings.

This morning, I woke up and found her in the living room, going through old photo albums. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in.

“Looking for something?” I asked.

She stared down at a photo of us from years ago. Me at least, I think it’s me smiling in front of a birthday cake, frosting on my chin. Her eyes flicked up to my face, then back to the photo. Her hands were trembling.

“You used to have a mole,” she whispered.

I blinked. “What?”

“On your left cheek,” she said, tapping the photo. “Where is it?”

I touched my cheek. “I… guess it faded.”

Her lips pressed into a tight line. “Moles don’t fade.”

I couldn’t think of anything to say. Just stood there like an idiot.

Tonight, she left a knife under her pillow.

I saw it when I walked past her room. The door was cracked open, and she was pretending to sleep. But I saw her fingers curled tight around the blanket, like she was bracing for something.

I think she’s afraid of me.

And the thing is… I been having dreams.

Dreams of things that don’t make sense. I hear echoes I see a forest. Wet leaves. I even smell smoke. And the face \*My\* face staring at me with wide, terrified eyes as I reached out for \*him\*. As I \*stepped into my skin\*.

I start to question myself.

""What am I?""

""Am I really who I am?""

Then one night I go to the bathroom and look in the mirror and see all the imperfections all the mistakes... then I see it I see what my mom sees...

I’m \*not\* her son and mom knows it.",48,1754531487.0,nosleep,3,0.98,False

I discovered I was an asexual about 3 years ago when I had my first ""boyfriend"" (we dated for like a week). I'm kind of new to the dating scene. My social anxiety has kept me from interacting with others since middle school, but I've been crawling out of my shell since college. I don't mind the gender of my partner and I was never the type to care about looks too much. I apologize in advance for the full on essay that I ended up writing 🫥

What I'm looking for in a partner:

Age Range- I prefer you to be older than me but honestly as long as your not below 20 or above 40 I'm good. 

Location- Florida🐊or any surrounding states 

Appearance- Not too picky, but I honestly prefer guys without facial hair. 😬 Ethnicity/race doesn't matter to me. Height though I can be iffy about, I've always imagined my partner being taller than me, but I feel like I'd like having a short king or queen 👑

Expectations:
I'm repulsed by sex, so obviously none of that. I may be up to having children at some point though, so maybe for that. I have my cats but I wouldn't mind having a kid either (later in life though) 
No smoking or vaping, alcohol is okay
Full commitment and honesty (I tend to fall for someone fast so I need open communication to make sure you're happy with me and not feeling burdened, but I can usually tell) 
Marriage (the end goal) 🎉

My interests:
*I'm a big anime fan, going on 9+years
*I love reading manga, manwha, and manhua
*I also love reading fantasy and romance books
*I love cats and dogs (I have 4 cats: 3 girls 1 boy) I'm also allergic to them 🫠
*I like watching gaming youtubers
*I like games but unfortunately don't have any gaming equipment (or a discord) 
* I love watching horror movies
*I like cute things, hello kitty being one of them
*I collect dolls and anime figures 
*I like traveling and discovering new places
*Cosplay (not too big on it but will dress up for cons) 
*Disney, my entire childhood

About me:

*Physical Appearance
 I'm not comfortable with posting photos of myself on the internet except Facebook. I can send a picture in DMs though(Once I get comfortable). For now here's a description:

5'9 Female
Dirty Blonde Hair, I have some purple in it for now
Weight : I honestly don't know I'd say 125lbs
Eyes: blue
Skin: I will burn in the sun

*Personality
I tend to be very quiet and observant. I can be a little awkward at first but once I get to know someone I can get a bit chatty. Very introverted and prone to overthinking. 

*Skills
-I can cook and I was once a Starbucks barista, so I can whip you up a good coffee or cocktail
-I play the piano, still in beginner mode though
-Violin, this skill has probably died
-A good listener, I'll be there for you to info dump anytime
-Accounting, the finances shall be tidy ✨

I’ve been digging into how tools like ChatGPT and Claude give product recommendations when people ask for ideas. Stuff like “what’s the best everyday backpack” or “top gifts for coffee lovers.” What surprised me is they aren’t just pulling from search results. They look at how clearly your store explains what it does, what you sell, and whether it fits the question being asked.

That got me thinking. How does one of these models actually see a Shopify store?

I started testing my own. Tweaked some product descriptions. Rewrote FAQs. Made my homepage and collections easier to understand. It helped. I started seeing my store come up more often when I asked the same questions back in the model.

But I also realized most stores aren’t set up for this. SEO tools and themes don’t help much here. So I started building my own process to simulate what these models see and give clearer feedback. Eventually I built a full tool that does the analysis and optimising for you. It checks how a model like ChatGPT might describe your store, finds where you’re missing signals, and helps you show up more when people are asking the right kinds of ""human written questions.""

I’ve been testing it on my own store and so far it’s been a useful layer on top of the usual SEO work.

Not trying to pitch anything here. Just curious if anyone else is noticing this shift. AI chat is fast becoming a source of high quality traffic and I think a lot of us might be overlooking it.

Anyone else playing with this idea or seeing AI bring in customers already?",1,1754530963.0,shopify,6,0.67,False

Get Paid From Bed to Test Apps—10 Remote Gigs (& the Secret Link) That SOUND TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?!,"GUYS. This just blew my mind and honestly, I’m unsure whether I should be excited or slightly suspicious—can someone tell me if we’ve entered a parallel universe where getting paid to test mobile apps from your own bed is just, like, the NORM now?! How did I not know about this?

Was it always possible to earn $$ by using apps on your phone, wrapped up in a burrito blanket, and maybe “testing” between Netflix marathons? I feel like I blinked and remote, flexible work hit a WHOLE new level.

Found something INSANE while doomscrolling and just… please tell me this isn’t a fever dream: 

**10 COMPANIES HIRING REMOTE MOBILE APP TESTERS IN 2025. Yes, ALL remote. Flexible hours. Weirdly easy-sounding gigs.**

- **Crowd Sourced Testers, Inc.**—Apparently you can sign up, log in anytime, and test all kinds of new apps. UI design, bug hunting, literally just poking around and giving feedback.

- **BetaSquad Network**—Hot take, isn’t it wild they pay you per app tested, and they’re desperate for new testers globally?

- **TestFairy Remote**—No fairy dust, but sweet flexible payment, casual contracts, and they love newbies who can spot glitches.

- **uTest Originals**—People in the forums say you can pick projects, test at midnight or noon, and you’re paid with actual money (not magic beans).

But wait—before you open TikTok, hold up: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is out here connecting REAL companies with home-based testers, and it’s super easy to sign up (I tried and my brain *almost* short-circuited at the simplicity).

AND MORE COMPANIES👇

- **AppLab Pioneers**  
- **RemoteAppChecker**  
- **Bugzapper Cloud**  
- **FlexiTest Digital**  
- **QA Nomads**  
- **GigTap Devices**  

All of these are *listed* as onboarding fresh testers, *some* without bizarre, years-old experience requirements! (FINALLY?!) Some supposedly pay more just to test international versions!

And the kicker—people in reviews claim you can flip between companies, stacking income. (??) 

But the wildest little loophole: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (yep, again) seriously curates all these positions. It’s like scrolling a list of gigs, picking your faves, and starting… today? IDK if I should trust it, double-dare you to click at least once.

Imagine:
- Wake up. Coffee. Check your “to test” list on your phone.
- You’re literally helping developers fix bugs *before* anyone else sees them.
- Set aside time, squeeze in 5-10 app tests, and… cha-ching.

Has anyone ACTUALLY worked with these places—or used **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and got paid, no drama?

How long has this been a secret?? Am I being pranked or is this THE remote side hustle for 2025?!

Schedule for the procedure a few months ago and today was the day. Walked in at 1pm and was greeted by the receptionist, after verifying all my information she gave me a post vasectomy kit which has a reusable ice pack, meds for the week, jock support underwear, condoms, and post care instructions. She then gave me valium and asked to go in the room and wait for the doctor who is still finishing up with another patient. 

115pm doctor walks in, he went over the after care procedure and explained what he was going to do. He then asked me to take off my pants and underwear and lay down on the table. He sprayed copious amount of disinfectant and asked me what music I preferred. The mellow music playing in the room was fine so I told him just to keep that on.  We made small talk during the procedure, he updated me that he’s done with one side and will be starting with the other side. Still no pain at this point just some pressure from the clamp and weird sensation when he pulled on the tube. Unpleasant burning smell during cauterization phase. He advised me that he’s done and will just be putting the skin glue. He asked me to put on my clothes as he cleaned and I can sit and wait for the nurse. 128pm

Nurse came in, asked if I was lightheaded or nauseous. I said no. She asked if I have a ride home, told her that my wife is waiting at the coffee shop in the plaza. She told me to text my wife cause I’m done and free to leave. 

Left the clinic at 1:32pm. Procedure was straightforward and easy. I’m hoping for a quick and painless recovery.

Then everything changed, when the kid reading came. Suddenly the stories went from actual stories to ""Sam sat on Mat. Mat sat on Sam"", and you can't do it at bedtime because they are too tired.

Have you ever wondered about the journey of your morning cup of coffee? Let's take a closer look at the fascinating process that starts with a humble coffee cherry.

From Plant to Harvest

It all begins on a coffee farm, where coffee plants are carefully cultivated. The coffee cherry, which is actually a fruit, grows on these plants. It takes several months for the cherries to ripen, changing color from green to red when they are ready to be picked.

Picking and Processing

Once the cherries are ripe, they are handpicked or harvested by machines. The next step is processing, where the outer layers of the cherry are removed to reveal the coffee bean inside. This can be done using the dry method (sun-drying) or the wet method (fermentation and washing).

Transport and Roasting

After processing, the coffee beans are dried and sorted before being packed and transported to various parts of the world. Once they reach their destination, the beans are roasted to perfection. Roasting is a crucial step that brings out the flavors and aromas we associate with coffee.

Grinding and Brewing

Finally, the roasted coffee beans are ground and brewed to make that perfect cup of coffee. Whether you prefer a classic drip coffee, a rich espresso, or a frothy cappuccino, the journey of the coffee cherry culminates in the delightful beverage that kickstarts your day.

Next time you savor your favorite brew, take a moment to appreciate the long and intricate journey that the coffee cherry has taken to reach your cup. It's a journey filled with hard work, dedication, and a touch of magic that transforms a simple fruit into a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions around the world. Enjoy!

My question is.... how to i politely interrupt someone when they are doing this, without hurting their feelings because truthfully the mental health at work seems fragile for everyone right now.

Would you just deal and let them vent? 

Or wouls you interupt and just say you cant listen right now cus of x y z? 

Today, i ended up saying i needed to go get water and a coffee and it ended it naturally, but this was after almodt 20 minutes of trauma dumping some really really heavy topics.

It's easy to look around at all the stuff that we've accumulated and to conclude that this mess of possessions is the cause of some of our problems, or perhaps a symptom of them. But often I find myself feeling grateful for the helpful functions that my things perform for me. In some instances, I also admire the beauty of their design.

For example the toothbrush that I use twice a day (more, if my hypochondriac inclinations are indulged) amazes me with its thoughtful workmanship. Though molded entirely out of the ecologically detestable and presumably dirt-cheap substance that also turns up in the manufacture of some trash cans, I find the manner in which it performs its function to be smart, novel and even (forgive me) elegant. 

A dedicated brusher, I frequently try out different angles of attack and change up my grip, the better to have at those microscopic organisms lurking in my mouth, and the treacly plaque that they squeeze out onto my choppers. Whenever I go for such an advanced technique, I find that the toothbrush artisans have providentially anticipated this maneuver on my part and have planned accordingly. If the tactic I want to try out calls for me to delicately clasp the toothbrush at its hilt, as it were, I find that, when I move my fingers into position on the brush handle, a small patch of rubber ridges is located at that very spot and ready to accommodate my grip. And the relevant portion of the handle is thoughtfully tapered to permit a secure grip between my fingers, while the angle of the toothbrush head permits me a variety of advantageous positions as I move the brush around inside my mouth.

Further to my toothbrush, I of course never miss the opportunity to let some of the foamy toothpaste spill out of my dumb guy mouth and onto my hands, where it inevitably runs down my wrist and onto the handle of this remarkable instrument. I guess that, since the handle of the toothbrush is crafted from the same material as the business end of the brush, both are capable of withstanding the solvent properties of my dribble. This undoubtedly saves me from having to buy a new toothbrush every week.

For another set of objects in my employ I experience a kind of affectionate appreciation almost each time I use them--they are my coffee cups! This is not some sort of hosanna to the therapeutic effect of coffee, for it is the cups themselves that make up a large measure of my enjoyment of java. The material that my cups are made of is the familiar ceramic, and the ones I tend to buy do have a lot of white in their color pattern. So I guess that's what gives them the feel of a medicinal tonic as I hold the mug in my hands of a morning, sipping their contents as if for nourishment.The cups in my collection have a pattern or image on their sides, and its application has lent the sides of the cup a cool, subtle texture that I feel each time I hold one of the cups. 

One cup in my collection is utterly mundane, but I value it as much as my other ones and fondly recall its provenance. I acquired it at my neighborhood dry cleaners a couple of years ago, having stopped in to pick up my weekly load of office-casual duds. After we had concluded our brief transaction, I lingered for a moment, because the two persons behind the counter appeared to be reviewing some sort of list while trying to arrive at a conclusion about whatever it was reporting to them. I could see that they disagreed with one another, and somehow I sensed that this conversation, being discreetly carried out in their native language, concerned me, though I didn't know what I would have done that would land me on a watch list maintained by my dry cleaner. Their minor dispute continued for a moment or two, when finally they were able to arrive at a conclusion. They put down the list and one of them picked up a small package wrapped modestly in decorative tissue paper. With friendly smiles they offered it to me, saying ""Happy Holidays"" (lucky for me they had switched back to English) in thanks for my small-scale but steady patronage. It was, after all, mid-December. They had taken the present from a stack of identical little packages, so it must have been their way of showing appreciation to their customers that Christmas. 

This small gesture on their part, and the cute way in which they had respectfully argued over the list--a sign that they took the act of gift-giving seriously--were somehow memorable to me. I therefore held onto the cup with its simplistic rendering of the store's logo, even though its humdrum universal coffee cup shape (and the simplistic logo) make it stand out among the graceful silhouettes of the fancy cups that I own. I suppose that it is the spirit of sincere friendliness and generosity in which the cup was given to me that distinguishes it from its higher-brow cohabitants of my cupboard.

Of course not all of my belongings can be compared to devoted, conscientious civil servants. And most of them have a record of occasional mishaps, a rap sheet of slip ups, when a momentary inattention caused them to fail to carry out their missions for me. Like those old sneakers that I almost tripped over in the hallway as I clomped to the bathroom a few nights ago. What were they thinking?! 

But I admit that, for the most, part I am lucky to have the benefit of so many dutiful objects--the bewitchingly gossamer plastic cling wrap, the paper towel dispenser with its spring-loaded arm, the ice cube trays that are paradoxically stiff and rigid but flexible enough that I can twist them to make the ice cubes pop out, and, yes, I am lucky to have my toothbrush. They all help to get me through my days and nights.",1,1754530514.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
