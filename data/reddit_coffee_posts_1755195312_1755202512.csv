Am I overthinking?,"Hi I am 17F in a dropper batch of jee I met her in 11 th she is fun and she is very very close to me she lives in pg and when she misses her home 
I bring her ghar ka khaana and all 
Now 
Here’s the full chai ☕ — My close friend has a boyfriend who literally treats her like a queen. I’ve seen it. He buys her expensive stuff: Stanley cups, branded clothes, liquor (she smokes too, so they hang out and vibe together), and basically never says no to her.

And yet… lately she’s been spending a LOT of time with another guy. We’re talking solo coffee dates, late-night texts, personal confessions, inside jokes all behind her boyfriend’s back.

When I asked her, she just laughed and said, “It’s not cheating if we’re not physical.” But honestly? If your boyfriend is investing his money, time, and emotions into you, and you’re hiding another “special connection,” isn’t that betrayal?
And and and 
And I am worried for her she will get in a big fat drama or tamasha if her boyfriend finds it out
I wanna stop her
But she says ""u need to trust me mai sab theek kardungi "" ghante ka theek krri
Usko sapne bhi aate hI ki she is caught and all
Bataoooo aap

My long term relationship ended half a year ago and I finally decided to move on. I had hard time telling my family and accepting that it's really over, but now I'm kinda over it and ready to move on. 

There's this one guy (23M) that I really like and I wouldn't like to text or go on dates with other people if there's a possibility that this guy likes me. We were friends in middle school and first year of highschool. Then he confessed that he liked me and I was in a relationship at that time, so we lost contact. Few years ago he reached out to me, we went out, but again, I was in this long-term relationship so we lost contact again. 
Now my relationship ended and I think he's aware of that. But I'm not sure if he's still interested in me, if he maybe has someone or maybe is afraid that I'm getting back with my ex and he doesn't want to get in the middle of that.

The thing is, my ex moved abroad and decided to break up. We're definitely not getting back together after everything he said to me.
This guy also lives abroad, but closer to my country and he visits often. I think he's currently here and would like to go out with him at least for a coffee, but I don't wanna seem desperate and text him first.

1mqblmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaffeineFreeLife/comments/1mqblmr/i_thought_i_was_tired_turns_out_i_was_just/,"I thought I was tired, turns out I was just addicted to caffeine","Hey everyone,

I recently watched a video titled [*You're Not Tired, You're Caffeinated*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9IHzp1RZyg) that completely changed my perspective on fatigue and energy. For years, I believed I was just a naturally tired person, always needing that morning coffee to get going. But this video explained how caffeine can disrupt our natural energy cycles, leading to a constant state of fatigue.

After watching it, I decided to take a break from caffeine to see if it was the culprit behind my tiredness. The first few days were challenging—headaches, irritability, and a noticeable dip in energy. But as the days went on, I started to feel more awake and alert without the need for caffeine.

It's been a week now, and the difference is incredible. I wake up feeling refreshed, my energy levels are more stable throughout the day, and I no longer experience the afternoon crashes that used to be a regular part of my routine.

If you're feeling constantly tired, it might not just be a lack of sleep—caffeine could be playing a bigger role than you think. I highly recommend checking out the video and considering how caffeine might be affecting your energy levels.

Has anyone else experienced similar changes after cutting out caffeine? I'd love to hear your stories and tips for staying caffeine-free.",1,1755201959.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False
1mqbki4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mqbki4/the_sea_of_tranquility_novel_free_read_online/,The Sea of Tranquility Novel Free read online," August in Florida means three things: heat, oppressive humidity, and school. School. I haven’t been to school in over two years. Not unless you count sitting at the kitchen table being home-schooled by your mom, and I don’t. It’s Friday. My senior year starts on Monday, but I haven’t registered. If I don’t go in today, I won’t have a schedule on Monday morning, and I’ll have to wait at the office for one. I think I’d rather skip the bad 80’s movie scene where I walk in late on the first day and everybody has to stop what they’re doing to stare at me, because while that wouldn’t be the worst thing that would ever happen to me, it would still suck.  
  
  My aunt pulls into the parking lot of Mill Creek Community High School with me in tow. It’s a cookie cutter high school. Except for the putrid color of the walls and the name on the sign, it’s an exact replica of the last one I attended. Margot‌—‌she made me drop the aunt part because it makes her feel old‌—‌turns down the radio she’s been blaring the entire way here. Thankfully it’s a short ride, because loud sounds make me edgy. It’s not the sound itself that bothers me; it’s just the fact that it’s loud. The loud sounds make it impossible to hear the soft ones and the soft sounds are the ones you have to be afraid of. I can handle it now because we’re in a car, and I usually feel safe in cars. Outside is a different story. I never feel safe outside.  
  
  “Your mother expects a phone call when we’re done here,” Margot tells me. My mother expects a lot of things she’s never going to get. In the scheme of things, a phone call is not much to ask, but that doesn’t mean she’ll get one. “You could at least text her. Four words. Registered. All is well. If you’re feeling really generous, you could even throw one of those little happy faces on the end. ”  
  
  I look sideways at her from the passenger seat. Margot is my mother’s younger sister by a good ten years. She is the opposite of my mother in almost every way. She doesn’t even look like her which means that she doesn’t look like me, either, because I am a carbon copy of my mother. Margot is dirty blond with blue eyes and a perpetual tan that she easily maintains by working nights and napping by the pool during the day; even though she’s a nurse and she should know better. I have pale white skin, dark brown eyes, and long, wavy, just-this-side-of-black hair. She looks like she belongs in a Coppertone ad. I look like I belong in a coffin. People would have to be stupid to believe we’re related, even if it is one of the only things about me that’s true.  
  
  She’s still got that cocky smile on her face, knowing that even if she hasn’t convinced me to placate my mother, then at least she’s planted a little guilt. It’s impossible to dislike Margot, even when you really, really try, which makes me hate her a little, because I’ll never be one of those people. She took me in, not because I don’t have anywhere else to go, but because I don’t have anywhere else I can stand to be. Luckily for her, she really only has to see me in passing, because once school starts, we’ll rarely ever be home at the same time. Even so, I doubt taking in a sullen, bitter, teenage girl with more issues than National Geographic is at the center of the vision board for a single woman in her early thirties. I wouldn’t do it, but then I’m not a very good person. Maybe that’s why I ran like hell from the people who love me the most. If I could be alone, I would. Gratefully. I’d rather be alone than have to pretend I’m okay. But they won’t give me that option. So I’ll settle for being with someone who at least doesn’t love me as much. I’m thankful for Margot. Not that I tell her this. Not that I tell her anything. I don’t.  
  
  When I walk in, the main office is a mass of commotion. Phones ringing, copiers running, voices everywhere. There are three lines leading up to the front counter. I don’t know which one to get into so I pick the one closest to the door and hope for the best. Margot sweeps in behind me and immediately pulls me around the side, past all of the lines, and up to the receptionist. She’s lucky I saw her coming, or the second her hand was on my arm, she would have found herself face down on the ground with my knee in her back.  
  
  “We have an appointment with Mr. Armour, the principal,” she says authoritatively. Margot, the responsible adult. She’s playing my mom’s part today. This is a side of her I don’t usually see. She prefers the cool aunt role. She doesn’t have any kids of her own, so this is a little out of her depth. I didn’t even realize we had an appointment, but I see the sense in it now. The receptionist, a fiftyish, unpleasant-looking woman, motions us to a couple of chairs next to a closed, dark wood door.  
  
  We only have to wait a few minutes and no one notices or acknowledges me at all. The anonymity is nice. I wonder how long it will last. I look down at myself. I didn’t get decked out for the visit today. I expected to come in, fill out some paperwork, hand over some immunization records and be done with it. I wasn’t expecting the swarms of students crowding the office. I’m wearing jeans and a black v-neck t-shirt, both a little – ok, a lot – tighter than they need to be, but otherwise completely non-descript. The shoes are where I made the effort. Black stilettos. Four-and-a-half inches of insanity. I’m not using them so much for the height, even though I seriously need it, as for the effect. I wouldn’t have bothered with them today, except I needed the practice. My balance on them has gotten better, but I figured a dress rehearsal wouldn’t hurt. I’d prefer to avoid eating ass on my first day of school.  
  
  I look at the clock on the wall. The second hand is bouncing back and forth inside my head, even though I know I can’t possibly hear the ticking over everything else going on. I wish I could tune out the noise in this room. It’s disconcerting. There are too many sounds at once and my brain is trying to separate them, to sort them out into neat little piles, but it’s almost impossible with all of the machines and voices melting together. I open and close my hand in my lap and hope we get called in soon.  
  
  A few minutes that seem like an hour later, the heavy wooden door opens and we’re ushered inside by a forty-something man in an ill-fitting shirt and tie. Attire aside, he’s not a bad-looking guy. Too good-looking to be a principal. He smiles warmly before sliding back behind his desk, into an oversized leather chair. The desk is imposing. Too big for this office. Obviously the furniture is meant to intimidate, because the man does not. Even before he’s said much, I peg him as soft. I hope I’m right. I’m going to need him on this.  
  
  I settle back into one of two matching burgundy leather chairs opposite Mr. Armour’s desk. Margot sinks into the chair next to me and launches into her spiel. I listen for a few minutes as she explains my “unique situation” to him. Unique situation, indeed. As she goes into detail, I see him glance over at me. His eyes widen just slightly as he looks closer, and I catch the glimmer of recognition in them. Yes, that’s me. He remembers me. If I had gotten further away, this might not even be necessary. The name wouldn’t mean much of anything. The face would mean even less. But I’m only two hours from ground zero and if even one person puts it together, I’ll be right back where I was there. I can’t take the chance, so here we sit, in Mr. Armour’s office, three days before the start of my senior year. Nothing like last minute. Though this, at lea  
st, is not my fault. My parents fought the move until the end, but they finally relented. I may have Margot to thank for some of that. Though I think the fact that I broke my father’s heart helped the cause a little, too. And, probably, they were all just tired.  
  
  I’m completely zoned out on the conversation now, and I’m busy checking out Armour’s office. There’s not much to distract, a couple of houseplants that look like they need to be watered, along with a few family pictures. The diploma on the wall is from the University of Michigan. His first name is Alvis. Huh. What kind of crap name is Alvis? I don’t even think it means anything, but I’ll definitely check later. I’m running through possible origins in my head when I see Margot pulling out a file and handing it to him. Doctor’s notes. Lots of them. As he looks over the paperwork, my eyes are drawn to the old-school metal hand-crank pencil sharpener on his desk. It strikes me as odd. The desk is a rich, fancy cherry number, nothing like the crap industrial ones teachers get. Why anyone would mount such an ancient pencil sharpener on it is beyond me. It’s a complete contradiction. I wish I could ask about it. Instead, I focus on the ring of adjustable pencil holes and wonder idly if my pinky finger would fit into any of them. I’m contemplating how much it would hurt to sharpen it, and how much blood there might be, when I hear Mr. Armour’s tone shift.  
  
  “Not at all?” He sounds nervous.  
  
  “Not at all. ” Margot confirms. She’s got her put-on, no-nonsense demeanor in full swing.  
  
  “I see. Well, we’ll do what we can. I’ll make sure her teachers are informed before Monday. Has she filled in a class request form?” And like clockwork, we’ve gotten to the part where he’s started to talk about me like I’m not in the room. Margot hands him the form and he peruses it quickly. “I’ll get this to the guidance department so they can have a schedule drawn up by Monday morning. I can’t promise she’ll get these electives. Most classes are already full at this point. ”  
  
  “We understand. I’m sure you’ll do whatever possible. We appreciate your cooperation and, of course, your discretion,” Margot adds. It’s a warning. Go Margot. I think it’s kind of wasted on him, though. I do get the feeling he genuinely wants to help. Plus, I think I make him uncomfortable, which means he probably hopes to see as little of me as possible.  
  
  Mr. Armour walks us to the door, shaking Margot’s hand and nodding almost imperceptibly at me with a strained smile that I think might be pity, or possibly, disdain. Then, just as quickly, he looks away. He follows us back into the chaos of the front office and asks us to wait a moment while he heads down a hallway to the guidance office with my paperwork.  
  
  I look around and see that several of the same people I saw earlier are still waiting in line. I thank whatever god still believes in me for appointments. I’d rather clean the inside of a Port-O-Let with my tongue than spend another minute in this cacophony. We stand against the wall as far out of the way as we can get. There are no empty chairs now. I glance to the front of the line where a dirty-blonde Ken doll is tossing his most panty-dropping smile in the direction of Ms. Unpleasant on the other side of the counter. Ms. Unpleasant is now positively glowing in the aura of this boy’s flirtations. I don’t blame her. He’s the kind of good-looking that transforms once self-respecting females into useless puddles of dumbass. I struggle to separate out their conversation. Something about an office aide position. Aahh, lazy bastard. He cocks his head to the side and says something that makes Ms. Unpleasant laugh and shake her head in resignation. He’s won whatever it is he came here for. I watch the slight shift in his eyes. He knows it, too. I’m almost impressed. While he’s waiting, the door opens again and a psychotically cute girl walks in and scans the room until her eyes land on him.  
  
  “Drew!” she yells over the commotion and everyone turns. She seems oblivious to the attention. “I’m not going to sit in the car all day! Come on!” I check her out while she glowers at him. She’s blonde, like him, though not exactly; her hair is lighter, like she spent the whole summer in the sun. She’s attractive in the most obvious way possible, wearing a pink, well-filled out halter top and carrying an obsessively color-coordinated, pink Coach purse. He seems mildly amused by her displeasure. Must be his girlfriend. A matching set, I think. Panty-Combusting Ken comes complete with Piqued Princess Barbie: unachievable measurements, designer purse and annoyed scowl included! He holds up a finger to her to convey that he’ll just be a minute. If I were him, I’d choose a different finger. I smirk at the thought and glance up to see him smirking right back at me, his eyes alight with mischief.

 Behind him, Ms. Unpleasant quickly scrawls something on his form and signs the bottom. She passes it back to him, but he’s still looking at me. I point to her and raise my eyebrows at him. Aren’t you going to get what you came for? He turns and takes the form from her hands, thanks her and winks. He winks at the menopausal office lady. He’s so blatantly obvious, it’s almost inspired. Almost. She shakes her head again and shoos him toward the door. Well-played, Ken, well-played.  
  
  While I’ve been amusing myself with the office drama, Margot’s been whispering with a woman who I assume is the guidance counselor. Drew, who I desperately want to keep calling Ken, is still standing near the door, talking to a couple other guys who are waiting at the back of the line. I wonder if he’s purposely trying to piss off Barbie. It seems easily done.  
  
  “Let’s go. ” Margot re-emerges, ushering me toward the front doors.  
  
  “Excuse me!” a woman’s raised voice shrills, before we make it to the exit. Everyone in line turns in unison, watching the woman hold up a file folder in my direction. “How do you pronounce this name?”  
  
  “NAH-stee-ya,” Margot enunciates, and I inwardly cringe, acutely aware of the audience around us. “Nastya Kashnikov. It’s Russian. ” She tosses the last two words off over her shoulder, obviously pleased with herself for some reason. We head out the door with everyone’s eyes on our backs.  
  
  When we reach the car, she lets out a sigh and her demeanor noticeably shifts back to the Margot I know. “Well, that hurdle’s cleared. For now,” she adds. Then she smiles her dazzling, all-American-girl smile. “Ice cream?” she asks, sounding like she might need it more than me. I smile back, because even at 10:30 in the morning, there’s only one answer to that question.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  Josh  
  
  Monday, 7:02 AM. Pointless. That’s what today is going to be, along with the 179 school days that come after it. I’d contemplate the waste of it all now if I had the time, but I don’t. I’m gonna be late as it is. I head to the laundry room and yank some clothes out of the still-running dryer. I forgot to turn it on last night, but I don’t have time to wait; so now I’m stuck pulling on a pair of damp jeans while I walk and trying not to trip over myself. Whatever. It’s not like I’m surprised.  
  
  I grab a coffee mug out of the cabinet and attempt to fill it without spilling it all over the counter and burning myself in the process. I put it on the kitchen table, next to a shoe box full of prescription bottles, in time to see my grandfather coming out of his room. His white hair is so disheveled that he momentarily reminds me of a mad scientist. He walks alarmingly slow, but I know better than to offer to help him. He hates that. He used to be so badass and now he’s not, and he feels every bit of that loss.  
  
  “Coffee’s on the table,” I say, grabbing my keys and heading for the door. “I laid out your pills and logged them already. Bill’s coming in an hour. You sure you’ll be ok until then?”  
  
  “I’m not an invalid, Josh,” he practically growls at me. I try not to smile. He’s pissed. Pissed is good. It makes things seem a little bit normal.  
  
  I’m in my truck and down the driveway in seconds, but I’m not sure it’ll be enough. I don’t live far from school, but the back-up to get into the parking lot on the first day is always a bitch. Most teachers will look the other way today, but I wouldn’t have to worry about it anyway; no one’s going to give me a detention, late or not. I floor it, and a couple of minutes later, I’m waiting to get into the lot. The line of cars snakes out onto the road, but at least it’s periodically moving. I’m running on four hours of sleep and only one cup of coffee. I wish I had had time to grab another one for myself, but I didn’t, and it probably would have ended up in my lap by the time I got to school anyway.  
  
  I pull out my schedule while I’m idling and check it again. Shop isn’t until fourth period, but at least it’s not all the way at the end of the day. The rest of it I don’t give a shit about.  
  
  When I finally make it onto campus, Drew is out front with his usual followers, regaling them with any number of BS stories about his summer. I know they’re all BS because he spent most of the summer hanging out with me and I know for a fact that we didn’t do crap. Apart from the time he spent disappearing with whatever girl he was hooking up with, he was on my couch. Looking at him now, I don’t think there’s anyone happier to be back at school. I’d roll my eyes if it didn’t seem such a chick thing to do, so instead, I just stare blankly ahead and keep walking. He nods in my direction as I pass, and I return the gesture. I’ll talk to him later. He knows I won’t go near him when he’s surrounded. No one else acknowledges me and I pass through the rest of the crowds, into the main courtyard, just as the first bell rings.  
  
  My first three classes could all be the same. All I do is listen to rules, pick up syllabi and try to stay awake. My grandfather was up five times last night, which means I was up five times last night, too. I really have to start getting more sleep. In a week you will, I think bitterly, but I won’t dwell on that now.  
  
  10:45 AM. First lunch. I’d rather just head straight to shop. Eating this early sucks. I make my way to the courtyard and park myself on the back of the bench farthest from the center, the same one I’ve sat at for the past two years. No one bothers me because it’s easier to pretend I don’t exist. I’d rather spend the half-hour sweeping sawdust than sitting here, but there isn’t any sawdust to sweep yet. At least it’s early enough that the metal benches aren’t scorching under the sun. Now I just have to wait out the next thirty minutes, which will probably be the longest of the day.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Nastya  
  
  Surviving. That’s what I’m doing now, and it hasn’t been quite as horrible as I expected. I get a lot of sideways looks, probably because of the way I’m dressed, but other than that, no one really talks to me. Except for Drew, the Ken doll. I did run into him this morning, but mostly it was a non-event. He talked. I walked. He gave up. I’ve made it to lunch and this is the test. No one’s really had much of an opportunity for socializing yet, so I’ve been able to skate below the surface, but lunch is just a highly unsupervised hell dimension. Avoidance seems the best option at first, but I have to face the looks and the comments at some point. Personally, I’d rather shove a cactus up my ass, but apparently that option isn’t on the table, so I might as well just rip the Band-Aid off now and get it over with. Then, I’ll find an empty restroom and check my hair and fix my lipstick or as we cowards like to call it‌—‌hide.  
  
  I try to surreptitiously check out my clothes and make sure nothing’s where it shouldn’t be and that I’m not flashing anything more than I’d originally planned. I’ve got on the same stilettos as Friday, but this time I went with a low cut black tank top and an almost non-existent skirt that my ass doesn’t look half-bad in. I left my hair down so it falls past my shoulders and covers the scar on my forehead. My eyes are rimmed with thick black eyeliner. It’s slutty and probably only attractive to the basest of human creatures. Drew. I smile to myself as I recall him looking me up and down in the hallway this morning. Barbie would be pissed.  
  
  I don’t dress this way because I like it so much or because I want people to stare at me in general. But people are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons anyway, and if they are going to stare at me for the wrong reasons, then at least I should get to pick them. Plus, a little unwelcome staring is a small price to pay for scaring everyone off. I don’t think there’s a girl in the school who will want to talk to me, and any boy who’s interested probably won’t be much for conversation. And so what? If I’m going to get unwanted attention, better it be for my ass than for my psychosis and my effed-up hand.  
  
  Margot hadn’t gotten home by the time I left for school this morning or she might have tried to talk me out of it. I wouldn’t have blamed her. I think my first period teacher wanted to nail me on a dress code violation when I first walked in; but once he checked my name on his roster, he ushered  
me to a seat and didn’t look at me again for the rest of the class.  
  
  Three years ago, my mother would have had a fit, cried, lamented her shortcomings as a parent, or possibly just locked me in my room, if she saw me at school like this. Today, she’d look disappointed but would ask if it made me happy and I’d nod my head and lie so we could pretend it wasn’t a problem. The clothes probably wouldn’t even be the biggest issue, because I’m not sure she would mind the streetwalker uniform nearly as much as the make-up. My mother loves her face. It’s not out of arrogance or conceit; it’s out of respect. She’s grateful for what she was born with. She should be. It’s an awesome face, a perfect face, an ethereal face. The kind people write songs and poems and suicide notes about. It’s that exotic kind of beauty that men in romance novels obsess over, even if they have no idea who you are, because they must possess you. That kind of beauty. That’s my mom. I grew up wanting to look just like her. Some people tell me I do, and maybe it’s true, under there somewhere. If you scrape off the make-up and dress me to look like a girl as opposed to what I look like now‌—‌a profanity-spewing guttersnipe being dragged out of a crack house on Cops.  
  
  I imagine my mother shaking her head and giving me the disappointed look, but she chooses her battles these days and I’m not sure this one would make the cut. Mom’s beginning to believe I may be a lost cause and that’s a good thing. Because I am, and I left her house so she could accept it. I was a lost cause a long time ago. That thought makes me sad for my mother, because she didn’t ask for any of this. She thought she’d gotten her miracle, and I was the only one who knew she hadn’t, no matter how much I wanted to give it to her. Maybe I was the one who took it away.  
  
  Which brings me back to the courtyard, where I am still waiting on the outskirts like a guest on an episode of Extreme Avoidance: High School Edition. I planned to get here early enough to make it across before lunch was in full swing, but I got sidelined by my history teacher, and that three minutes meant the difference between a half-empty courtyard and the one teeming with students that I’m staring at right now. I’m focused, at the moment, on the brick pavers covering the entirety of said courtyard, and seriously questioning the wisdom of my four-and-a-half-inch stilettos. I’m gauging my odds of making it across with both my ankles and my dignity intact when I hear a voice to my right call out.  
  
  I turn instinctively, but I know immediately that it’s the wrong thing to do. Sitting on a bench, a couple feet away, is the owner of that voice and he’s looking right at me. He’s leaning back casually, with his legs spread farther apart than they need to be in a blatant display of wishful thinking. He smiles, and I can’t deny that he knows he’s good-looking. If self-adoration were cologne, he would be the boy you couldn’t stand next to without choking. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Like me. We could be brother and sister, or one of those really creepy couples who look like they should be brother and sister. I’m pissed at myself for looking. Now, when I turn and ignore him to make my way across the battlefield, I can be certain that his eyes‌—‌as well as every other set of eyes on that bench with him‌—‌are going to be trained on my back. And when I say my back, I mean my ass. I re-contemplate the unstable surface of the pavers. No pressure or anything. I avert my eyes back to the task at hand in time to hear him add, “If you’re looking for someplace to sit, my lap is free. ” And there it is. It’s not even clever or original, but his equally wit-free friends laugh anyway. There go my hopes for our bourgeoning sibling kinship. I step off the ledge and start walking, keeping my eyes trained straight ahead as if I have some purpose outside of simply surviving this walk. I’m not even halfway through the day. I still have four of the seven classes left on the schedule that shit gave birth to.

Posting here since I thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :) 

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant along with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book, playing a couple games & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, or catching the sunset by the pier.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! For the holiday season, my go-to movie is ""It's A Wonderful Life""

There’s a 7/11 right down the road from me, and I only go in there when I’m out of milk or I’ve run out of my little powdered coffee creamer packets. It’s always got this same fella at the register. Well, not really a fella—more like a flat picture of one. He’s wearing sunglasses indoors (which I think is rude) and this funny green-trimmed shirt. Just stands there, never moves.

Now here’s the odd part. They don’t play normal music in there. No country, no rock, nothing. Just a voice coming over the speakers saying the rules for “hot tub etiquette.” I don’t even have a hot tub, so I just tune it out. It’ll say things like, *“Always shower before entering the tub,”* and *“No glass in the water.”* Which makes sense, I suppose.

But the other night I ran in there after Bingo because I needed cat food. It was past midnight, and the voice came on and said, *“Never enter alone after midnight.”* And then, clear as day, it said, *“Unless you want company.”*

I thought that was mighty strange. I looked over at the picture-man at the register, and I’ll be darned if he wasn’t GONE. I about dropped my Friskies right there.

The next day, in the daylight, he was back, plain as anything. But there was water on the counter, like someone had been splashing around. And I could swear, in the reflection of those sunglasses, I saw a big old hot tub with steam coming off it… and somebody waving at me to come on in.

Let’s Unwrap the Truth Behind the World’s Most Mysterious Present!","Wait… how did we all become obsessed with gift cards? I mean, does anyone else remember the first time they saw one at the checkout? My heart literally did a bunny hop—“Oh wow, this is an actual present, on a rectangle, and I don’t have to guess anyone’s size!” Suddenly, picking the “perfect” gift meant you got to avoid mall-induced headaches (and awkwardly pretending you know if someone wears medium or large). 

But! Here’s what absolutely flabbergasts me: why are gift cards painted as either the best-ever, or the biggest cop-out in gifting history? I’ve heard it all. “It’s so thoughtful, you let them choose!” versus “C’mon, that’s what you give when you don’t care.” Do people honestly believe that?

- Sure, there’s the classic coffee shop card (we ALL know someone obsessed)  
- The video game credit for that cousin you secretly think is becoming a low-key pro gamer (sponsorship, WHEN?)  
- Or my favorite—those TOTAL wildcard cards, for stores you never enter because, um, where exactly is LuvCraftia?

Then it gets stranger. Ever gotten a gift card, laughed, and actually thanked the gifted out loud, while inside *screaming* because you have no PLAN? Suddenly you’re forced to explore spaces you’ve never browsed. Is this the universe nudging me to manifest a craft-hobbyist makeover? Am I about to take up pottery? 

Explore thousands of stories at https://goodnovel.org/ if you want to see how fictional characters wrestle with quirky, twisty life moments just like this.

Side note: Someone said gift cards reek of “last-minute panic.” Huh? If you grab a truffle assortment and a gift card, does your effort level go up or stay the same? If you slip a loving joke inside the envelope (“For the day your boss is extra-dramatic and you NEED caffeine”), doesn’t a gift card become weirdly personal, even tailor-made?

So here are all the burning questions spinning in my head:
- Are gift cards impersonal or just incredibly freeing?
- Is flexibility the NEW luxury?  
- Can you be creative *with* the gift card? Attach a cryptic note, dare them to use to buy the wildest, shiniest item possible, then trade unboxing stories? 

I’d rather get a little card letting me discover something new than a sweater that turns me into a walking blanket. Is that strange? Or secretly what everyone wishes but is too shy to admit?

Dive into plot twists about generosity, misunderstandings, and gratitude at https://goodnovel.org/ …because really, every gift (and awkward holiday moment) is a story waiting to be told.

So—gift card givers, are you the practical hero or misunderstood genius? Should we all just embrace that rectangle of infinite potential as the royalty of modern luxury gifts?

Or will you take your chances and get me another mug for my crowded kitchen cabinet? (Spoiler: I secretly love mugs too.)

Let’s make this the year we redefine what a “thoughtful present” even *means*.

Wow, okay, now I want to go see what kind of gift cards even exist out there…and possibly read about all the drama they could cause at https://goodnovel.org/—just imagine the wild stories villains would swap if THEY had places to spend evil points.",1,1755201472.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

1mqbczm,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mqbczm/adhd_mistaken_for_gad/,ADHD mistaken for GAD?,"hello!
first time posting here:) this is gonna be long, sorry!!. 

For some context, I'm a 23 year old woman, I'm currently diagnosed with GAD and cPTSD. I have been treated for anxiety and depression ever since I was 14 - my depression responded nicely to meds and therapy but not my anxiety. I was on strong sedatives for a large portion of my teenage years but while they did mellow me down, the noise in my head never stopped. 

This brings me to now: I'm currently preparing for my state exams to graduate uni and I was struggling immensely; I have to study 3 years worth of material in a short amount of time. I never had problems with studying, mostly because I never had to study too hard, I just had to read the material for each exam a couple of times and boom, I passed with a B or C. But this doesn't really apply here, as it's a lot more material. 

Anyway, so studying for this exam seemed like an impossible task, I'd wake up, make coffee and... do nothing. Just stare at the ceiling or doomscroll while beating myself up over not studying. I'd do that for hours and then eventually maybe I'd open my laptop just to get overwhelmed with the amount I have to study and cry. 

So, I asked my ADHD diagnosed friend for a little boost (Ritalin). And oh my god! My head has never EVER been this quiet. For the first time in my life I could actually just sit down and work without having this huge internal struggle with it. It's hard to explain... It's like my brain shut up for the first time in my life and I could just do stuff. I didn't feel high or study for long hours like I had expected. I genuinely just did something that I had always thought was impossible: study for two hours, take a break, eat a meal and then study for two more hours. I know it seems simple but for this is insane. 

So clearly my brain responds to this stuff, doesn't mean I hage ADHD... but then I started thinking and it all clicked. How I got a D for my bachelor's thesis for bad formatting and missing details despite the content itself being good. How I would break down during cleaning because it was overwhelming. My mom yelling at me because I can't organise stuff. How I'd always forget to bring a pen and a pencil to school when I was a kid. How insanely disorganised I am despite trying SO hard to be better at this. 
And most importantly, the damn constant noise in my brain: it's like ten different people are constantly having conversations in my head that I can't understand and on top there's 3 different songs of different genres playing. I always thought this was anxiety.

I know none of you here can diagnose me and this is something that I'll have to bring up with my psychiatrist and therapist...but has anyone gone through something similar? Maybe share some experiences with me? I'd really appreciate it 🫶🏻

Sometimes they’d have pop music on and people would do little happy dances.  It was kind of nice to meet some ppl but I stopped going.

My only friends are one who lives out of state.  A lot of what he talks about is unclear and lacks details so it is difficult to understand what he’s going through or how I can help.  I’m tired of this relationship… when he and I would hang out before he moved it was boring and I would agree to spend time bc I had nothing else to do.  My other friend is a dude I work with, not much interaction other than that these days.

When it comes to family, they have been supportive of my recoveries.  I just do not enjoy their company.  I often turn down invitations to dinners, coffee or larger gatherings.  If I spend time with them I am bored and feel drained afterward even though it’s just from sitting down talking a little bit.  My parents both have constant, extremely furrowed brows and I do not want to be a part of that.  I notice it is contagious.  

I’m miss having genuine friends who are cheerful.  My time with people is like a probationary meeting.  A condition that must be maintained.  But I don’t know what.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Norway Eliteserien Showdown: Bodø/Glimt vs. Stromsgodset – A Goal-Soaked Farce**

**Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem**  
Let’s cut through the noise with some cold, hard numbers. Bodø/Glimt is the undisputed favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.33** (implied probability: **75%**) across bookmakers like BetRivers, BetMGM, and BetUS. That means the market expects them to win roughly three out of every four games against Stromsgodset. Meanwhile, Stromsgodset’s odds of **7.5** (implied probability: **11.7%**) suggest they’re about as likely to win as a snowman in a sauna. The draw? A meager **16.4%** chance, which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Don’t waste your time betting on a tie.”

The spread tells an even starker story: Bodø/Glimt is favored by **-1.5 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win by *at least two goals*. If you’re a fan of nail-biters, this isn’t your match. The total goals line sits at **3.5**, with the over priced slightly lower than the under. But let’s be honest—when one team is this dominant, “over 3.5 goals” might as well be “over 3.5 liters of coffee for Stromsgodset’s defense; it’s always leaking.”

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Stromsgodset Should Pack Their Toothbrush**  
Unfortunately, there’s no official word on injuries or transfers for this matchup, but we can infer from the odds alone. Bodø/Glimt, Norway’s version of a goal-scoring espresso shot, has been a machine this season, winning the Eliteserien title multiple times in recent years. Their attack? Sharper than a Viking’s axe. Their defense? Tighter than a jar of Norwegian *surstrømming* (if you’ve ever opened one, you know what I mean).

Stromsgodset, on the other hand, is… well, let’s say they’re “adventurous” in attack but “creative” in defense. Last season, they finished mid-table, which is sports code for “they’re hoping for a miracle and a better transfer window.” Without specific injury

One night while I was brushing my teeth, I gazed out the window. In the light of my motion sensor light, I saw Derrick reaching into the trunk of his car. Out he pulled a large cardboard box with the Spirit Halloween logo on it. I had never seen have a bigger smile, even bigger than the one at his wedding. The next morning while also brushing my teeth, I saw a 12 foot skeleton sitting in Derrick’s front lawn. It stood looking across the street, with its hand in a waving position.

Over the next few years, I saw that skeleton in his yard for a majority of the time. Every time a new holiday would come around on the calendar, the skeleton would be put into a new outfit. Uncle sam hat for 4th of July, santa hat for Christmas, and just plain old skeleton for Halloween. Derrick really loved the skeleton. I would see him quickly rush it inside anytime it was slightly too windy or rainy. Even during the town’s tornado warning scare last year, before retreating to his basement he collected the skeleton outside.

But in October of last year, we got an HOA. I don’t even know who wanted it to be honest. They just showed up one day and made me cut my azaleas because they did not fit my house’s color scheme. From the start nobody really liked them, like all HOAs. One of those people was obviously Derrick. One day while walking past his house I saw Derrick cleaning up the skeleton a bit, so I threw him a wave. Instead of waving back, he came up to me on the sidewalk to talk to me.

“Hey man, I was just wondering if you had my back if I decided to stand up to the HOA? I just read through the rules and they said that I would not be allowed to display Jerry outside of October. I’m planning on keeping him up as a protest.”

“Jerry? Are you talking about the skeleton?”

“Oh yeah, sorry, forgot that’s an inside joke between me and me. So if the HOA shows up and tells me to take it down, could you speak on my behalf in the HOA meeting?”

I felt a little bit pressured. Saying no felt a little bit rude with how much Derrick loved “Jerry” and all. But since the skeleton has always been a joy to see, and since I also hated the HOA, I told him yes. He repeatedly thanked me with his hands together.  So when November 1st rolled around, I was prepared to see Jerry disappear. But I wasn’t prepared for it to happen on November 1st.

I was on my porch, sipping warm black coffee from my Jack Skellington mug. Jerry stood with his fists up, ready to fight any HOA members. Across the street, Justin was stapling Christmas lights to his roof while standing on a ladder. He had headphones in, bobbing his head to what was probably Maria Carrie. In Justin’s yard, was an army of Christmas inflatables. Santas, Reindeer, Grinches, and many others flooded his yard. This made me mildly annoyed.

As I was shaking my head behind Justin’s back, a white SUV pulled in front of Derrick’s house. The door opened and out popped a middle aged woman wearing a sweater vest. It was the HOA president, pretty sure her name was Jasmine or something like that. So Jasmine marched up Derrick path and knocked on his glass screen door. While waiting for an answer, she checked her apple watch for the time, she probably read a time around 8 AM. After a short wait, Derrick opened the door wearing a robe. Derrick opened his mouth to speak, but before he could Jasmine spoke up.

“Yeah Hello, Derrick, I was just wondering if you were aware of what day it was?” She said demeaningly, like she was speaking to a child who had to be taught a lesson.

“Oh uh yeah, pretty sure it’s Saturday.”

“Not that kind of day, the other kind.” She said as she grabbed her nose and shook her head side to side.

“Oh sorry, it would be November 1st, have a good Halloween last night.?”

“No, my kids got all hyper and wouldn’t sleep. But to why I’m here, what is that?” She said as she pointed at the 12 foot skeleton behind her. 

“That’s Jerry.” He said while chuckling.

“No, it’s not, it is a violation of the HOA guidelines. No Halloween decorations up outside of October, take it down immediately please.”

“No. I’m not going to do that.” Derrick’s cheerful goofy tone ended, he spoke with a sternness I had not heard from him before.

“Okay well if you’re not then I will and I will be forced to put it in the dumpster and fine you.” She crossed her arms.

“If you do that I will literally call the cops on you, that is theft.”

“Well let’s just see who’s side they are on.”

Once Jasmine finished saying that, she turned around and walked for the skeleton. As she did Derrick pulled out his iPhone and dialed a number and held it to his ear. He then went inside with the phone. Jasmine got up behind Jerry, and put her hands on the pelvis and pushed. Jerry came tumbling over on the grass. When he hit the ground, his skull popped off and rolled to the sidewalk. Jasmine walked to it and it picked it up. As her back was turned, Jerry stood himself up. Jasmine walked over to her SUV, and opened the trunk. As Jasmine was waiting for the trunk to open, Jerry, still headless, walked to her and lightly tapped on her shoulder. 

“What do you wa-” 
She couldn’t finish her sentence, she stood looking directly up at Jerry. Jerry gently pulled his skull out of her hands. Jasmine stood this mouth a gap, stunned, unable to move. I have to say, when I was this I too was rather frightened, but I stayed sitting on my porch to watch what would happen next. Jerry would then grab Jasmine by the neck and lift her off the ground. Jasmine reached for Jerry’s boney hands to free herself. She kicked her legs to assist the escape but Jerry must have had a lot of invisible muscle, for she did not come close to escaping. Jerry then changed his grip on her from her neck to her ankle. She swayed back and forth upside down. 

Have you guys ever watched The Avengers? If you have, then you are familiar with the scene where the Hulk grabs Loki and repeatedly slams Loki on the ground. That is what Jerry would do to Jasmine. Over and over on the pavement of the road, Jerry would slam Jasmine with all of his force. Jasmine didn’t make a single sound after the first swing. After a dozen or so swings, Jasmine was dead. Most of her upper body was deformed, and her sweater vest was now soaked in blood. 

I sat in silence, in disbelief of what just happened. I always wonder what Derrick’s reaction to that was. Was it like when a parent finds out their kid is a bully in school? Was it like when a parent’s child goes to prison? Or was he proud of what he saw? I really have no clue. 
 
Jerry looked up from Jasmine’s body, and changed his focus across the street. He breathed heavily, then started to walk towards Justin. I could hear Justin faintly singing some Christmas song. I thought of how good those headphones were, to where he couldn’t hear a 12 foot skeleton approach him from behind. I thought about asking him what brand they were. Too bad I wouldn’t get the chance. Once Jerry made it to the ladder, he grabbed the top of it and threw it over. I heard Justin let out a yell before I heard him and the ladder make a thump sound. 

I wasn’t actually able to see what happened next, most of it was blocked by Justin’s mini van. But based on the movement of Jerry, Justin was being stomped to death. Justin called out for help, but it was difficult to hear over the roar of inflatables. I saw Justine’s wife quickly glance out the curtains, but after seeing what was out there she promptly shut them. Jerry gave a few more good stomps before stopping. He then turned his attention to the inflatables in the front yard. He tore through all of them. Popping Santa and killing Rudolph. Tearing through the Grinch and unplugging Frosty.

Standing in a pile of now dead Christmas cheer, he changed his attention to me. I could tell he was looking at my Jack Skellington mug. So I said aloud in a shaky voice,

“Sorry, it’s actually a Halloween movie, so if you have some problem with Christmas this is not the place.”

He marched towards me anyway, across the street, through my yard and up to my porch. I tried to quickly stand up and run, but before I could do the running part Jerry grabbed me by the neck and pulled me out from the porch. He started to punch me in the stomach a few times, knocking the air out of me. As he did, I saw a police cruiser down the road, probably the one called by Derrick. I hoped that Jerry didn’t kill me before the cruiser got there. The time it took for the cruiser to drive those few blocks felt like forever. When it finally did get to my block, I saw the nod his head and drive away, while saying to himself,

“Nope, not today.”

I was now on my own, repeatedly getting punched by a 12 foot skeleton. I remembered this was how Houdini died. If Houdini couldn’t survive this, how could I? Then for a second, Jerry stopped punching me. For a second I thought he was letting me go, but then I was lifted over his head and flung across the street. I flew over Justin’s car and landed on the fallen ladder. After hitting the ground, it took me a second to understand what was around me. But after a few deep breaths that went away. The first thing I saw was Justin’s body. Oh yeah, he was stomped to death. The first thing I heard was music coming from 2 places. The first was from Justin headphones in the grass, they were playing Jingle Bell Rock. The second was from a caroling mini van coming down the road towards me.

I saw Jerry walking towards me, before he could pick me up again, I snatched Justin’s headphones. Oh their Beats brand. Jerry then picked me up by the skull, he placed my head in between his two massive hands. He started to squeeze. I could feel the pressure in my head building up, my eyes starting to pop out of socket. But before my head could be crushed like a jack-o-lantern on November 1st. I slid the headphones over Jerry's ears. He immediately dropped me. Jerry fell backwards on top of a popped Santa. He started to shake, his bones clacking together like a xylophone. The mini van was 1 block away. 

I quickly think of something cool to say while I would end Jerry’s life. It had to be something sort of relevant to Christmas or Halloween. Then I thought of something.

“This is what you have to understand Jerry. Christmas, that’s in 54 days. But Halloween, that’s in 364. So whether you like it or not, it's Merry freakin’ Christmas.”

As I finished the coolest thing I ever said, I pulled my foot back and launched it forward and planted it in Jerry’s chin. His head launched off like a firework. Flying off into the street and perfectly underneath the front wheel of the caroling mini van. Without any difficulties, Jerry’s skull was crushed. The family stopped singing Jingle Bells to ask what they had just hit. I looked down, the skeleton had stopped shaking and laid still and the ground. I kicked at his ribs, he didn’t move.

I walked across the street and knocked on Derrick’s door to tell him what happened. When he opened he already had tears in his eyes. He didn’t even cry at his wedding, I thought. Before I could say anything, Derrick ran across the street and held Jerry in his arms. I went inside my own house and called the police. Not sure who will go to prison for this one, case still hasn’t happened yet. Probably a bit hard to make sense of it all. Me and Derrick have talked and we have no clue what causes Jerry to all of a sudden come alive like that.
But now, if you were to drive around our neighborhood you will not see any 12 foot skeletons named Jerry. Instead, you will see a flag pole in Derrick’s front yard. Forever flying a skull and crossbones. With a small plaque at the bottom, that reads.

“IN MEMORY OF THE ONE AND ONLY JERRY.”

## Key Features Analysis

The best whole house RO systems in 2025 boast a range of advanced features designed for optimal performance and longevity.

**Multi-Stage Filtration:** Leading systems incorporate multi-stage filtration, typically including a sediment filter, carbon filters, and the RO membrane itself.This sequential filtration process ensures that larger particles and chlorine are removed before the water reaches the RO membrane, protecting it from premature fouling and extending its lifespan. The sediment filter usually targets dirt, rust, and sand, while the carbon filters address chlorine, chloramine, and organic chemicals, considerably improving taste and odor.

**High-Capacity RO Membrane:** The heart of any RO system is its membrane, and top-tier systems utilize high-capacity membranes capable of producing significant volumes of purified water.

These membranes are rated based on their Gallons Per Day (GPD) output, which indicates how much purified water the system can generate in 24 hours. For larger households or those with high water consumption, a higher GPD rating is essential to meet demand. look for membranes constructed from thin-film composite (TFC) material for superior rejection rates of contaminants.

**Automatic Flushing System:** Many sophisticated RO systems include an automatic flushing system designed to clean the membrane regularly.

This feature automatically rinses the RO membrane to remove accumulated impurities and prevent scaling, which can significantly reduce the system's efficiency and lifespan. Automatic flushing minimizes the need for manual maintainance and ensures consistent water quality over time.

**Real-Time Monitoring System:** Advanced systems integrate electronic monitoring systems that provide real-time data on water quality and system performance.

These systems frequently enough include sensors that measure TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) levels, indicating the overall purity of the water. They may also track water pressure, flow rates, and filter life, alerting users when it's time to replace filters or address any potential issues. Data can frequently enough be accessed thru a digital display or a smartphone app.

**Permeate Pump:** Consider incorporating a permeate pump into the system for enhanced efficiency, especially if your water pressure is low.

Permeate pumps redirect rejected water pressure to push water through the RO membrane more quickly and efficiently. This reduces wastewater, increases purified water production, and improves overall system performance, especially in homes with low water pressure.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a whole house RO system provides numerous benefits that extend beyond just better tasting water.

**Comprehensive Contaminant Removal:** RO systems effectively remove a wide range of contaminants, including lead, arsenic, fluoride, bacteria, viruses, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals.

This comprehensive filtration provides peace of mind, knowing that the water used for drinking, cooking, and bathing is free from harmful substances. Unlike conventional filtration methods that target specific contaminants,RO provides a broad-spectrum solution for water purification.

**Improved Appliance Lifespan:** RO water is free from minerals and scale-forming agents that can damage appliances like water heaters, washing machines, and dishwashers.

Using RO water can significantly extend the lifespan of these appliances by preventing mineral buildup and corrosion. This leads to reduced maintenance costs and fewer replacements over time.

**Enhanced Skin and Hair Health:** RO water is gentle on the skin and hair, as it lacks harsh chemicals and minerals that can cause dryness, irritation, and damage.

Bathing and showering in softened water can lead to softer, smoother skin and healthier, more manageable hair. Many users find that they need to use less soap and shampoo, as RO water lathers more easily.

**Better Tasting Food and Beverages:** The absence of chlorine, minerals, and other impurities in RO water significantly improves the taste of food and beverages.

Coffee, tea, and other drinks prepared with RO water have a cleaner, more refreshing flavor. Similarly, fruits and vegetables washed in RO water retain their natural flavors and textures.

## FAQs Section

Let's address some common questions regarding whole house RO systems.

**how much wastewater does a whole house RO system produce?**

The amount of wastewater produced varies depending on the system's efficiency and water pressure. typically, RO systems generate between 2 to 4 gallons of wastewater for every gallon of purified water. However, more efficient systems with permeate pumps or other water-saving technologies can reduce this ratio significantly.

**What is the typical lifespan of a whole house RO system and its components?**

The lifespan of a whole house RO system depends on several factors, including water quality, usage, and maintenance. Generally, the RO membrane should be replaced every 2 to 5 years, while pre-filters (sediment and carbon filters) should be replaced every 6 to 12 months.The system itself can last for 10 to 15 years with proper maintenance.

**what are the maintenance requirements for a whole house RO system?**

Regular maintenance is essential to ensure optimal performance and longevity. This includes replacing pre-filters on schedule, sanitizing the system periodically, and monitoring water quality.Some systems have automatic flushing mechanisms that help reduce maintenance requirements. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for specific maintenance procedures.

**Can I install a whole house RO system myself, or do I need a professional installer?**

1mqbbih,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1mqbbih/been_caffeine_free_for_over_a_year_and_was/,"Been caffeine free for over a year, and was depressed and anhedonic ever since. Decided to try 1 cup today…","I started drinking caffeine really early. Around 9-10 years old, and kept drinking it until I was around 24. Been always an anxious person, despite having very high testosterone levels, which a lot of men say usually makes you not care about any anxiety. (Not in my case) 

I decided to quit caffeine just over a year ago, maybe it’s been around a year and a half now. Ever since I quit caffeine, my life has been basically just shit. 

I quit Gym, I’ve stopped doing MMA, I don’t enjoy music, movies, or games anymore. I’ll get these windows where I sometimes get these urges of wanting to do things back once in a while, but they usually don’t last. It’s the whole windows and waves pattern that people talk about. 

Constant brain fog, no memory, loss of IQ, etc.

I’ve lost a lot of my muscle and gained quite a bit of fat. Haven’t been able to drag myself out of my house, except to work. Sometimes I won’t even go to the store, because I just have this constant dread, where even the most simple tasks feel like climbing Mount Everest. 
I know this sounds like typical depression. 

I did have positives of quitting caffeine. One of them was just having more vivid dreams, and being able to relax at night better, so I can fall asleep easier. Another one was my anxiety was very minimal, and my blood pressure was actually quite stable and healthy. 
That was pretty much it. 

Today I’ve decided to try one cup of coffee. It wasn’t even anything fancy or strong. Just your typical cheap coffee you get from the store, and after about 20-30 minutes it’s like a rusty old generator fired up in my brain. 
My brain started functioning again. 
I have this strong urge to go to the gym, which I remember I had. 
I wanted to clean my entire house.
I started thinking about my old hobbies again, and I’ve decided to listen to my speaker setup, and actually felt the music for once. 

Now obviously this is probably because I’m desensitised to it, and it wouldn’t do this to me in the long term. (Maybe it would, because I remember being a productive person before) 

My entire family have been coffee drinkers their entire life, and some of them literally work 12 hour shifts, and still have energy to do other hobbies. Whereas for the past 1.5 years, I’ll work a 8 hour shift, and I basically want to close myself off from humanity and responsibilities for 24 hours. 

I’m the only one who decided to quit this drug, and I’ve been a useless meat suit ever since. 

One of my fears, and theories has been that because I’ve drunk this substance from a very young age, before puberty even. My brain formed itself around this substance, so now it doesn’t know how to function without it. 

Is there anyone else who is a shell of themselves without caffeine, and has been able to recover? 

If so, how long did it take? 

I’m honestly at a point where I’m kinda on the brink of giving up. 
I don’t like to make excuses, but 1.5 years is long enough of a sacrifice to change for the better, but I don’t even see any glimpses of it being better.

1mqb7c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1mqb7c6/reveal_if_the_best_business_laptop_dell_inspiron/,Reveal if the best business laptop Dell Inspiron is worth it,"The Dell Inspiron with its sleek black design arrived at my doorstep just a few weeks ago. Advertised as a business laptop, I decided to test its limits, using it daily for both work and entertainment. As someone who's always juggling between writing, video calls, and some light-hearted gaming during downtime, I needed a device that could handle it all without breaking a sweat. The Dell Inspiron 3520 certainly promises a lot on paper, but it wasn’t without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the laptop gives off a no-nonsense vibe. Its matte black finish and slim profile make it look chic yet professional. At just 3.65 pounds, I found it incredibly light to carry around, even during my hectic commutes. However, the plastic body doesn’t scream premium. It’s functional and sturdy enough, but don’t expect any heads to turn when you open it during your coffee shop work session. The 15.6-inch Full HD screen, with its anti-glare feature and narrow borders, has been brilliant for late-night Netflix binges without worrying about straining my eyes. The hinge, while stable during use, felt slightly stiff while opening. I’m hoping it eases up with time.

**Performance Prowess**  
With a 12th Gen Intel Core i3-1215U processor under the hood, this laptop is designed for everyday tasks. I’ve had multiple Chrome tabs open alongside editing documents in Word and casual photo editing in Lightroom, and it hasn’t lagged yet. The addition of 16GB of RAM certainly aids here, offering a smooth multitasking experience. While it’s no powerhouse for heavier gaming or video editing, the Intel UHD Graphics manages basic multimedia tasks with ease. Boot times were snappy thanks to its 512GB SSD, which also cuts down on noise and heat—both are definite wins in my book.

**[Check Dell Inspiron price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0ckpk1syg/)**

**Display and Visuals**  
The Full HD 1920x1080 resolution was a pleasant surprise. Colors appeared crisp, and text was sharp, which made writing and proofreading feel less of a chore. Watching a movie on its 15.6-inch LED-backlit screen felt immersive, although I did notice that the brightness struggles a bit in direct sunlight. That anti-glare coating helps indoors, but outdoors, you might find yourself squinting more than you'd like.

**Connectivity Options**  
This laptop is a master of connectivity. It’s loaded with options that cater to almost every need. With its Wi-Fi 6 support, I experienced lightning-fast internet speeds, perfect for those Zoom meetings that leave no room for lag. The Bluetooth connection synced up effortlessly with my wireless keyboard and mouse. Ports include USB 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, an HDMI port, and even an SD card reader, which is pretty rare these days. I tested them all, and everything worked as advertised. If only it had USB-C, though—it felt like a bit of a modern-day necessity missing from an otherwise extensive repertoire.

**Storage and Upgradability**  
The 512GB SSD provided ample space for my work files and endless cat videos, but what truly stands out is the upgradability. With options to expand memory to 32GB and storage up to 2TB, this laptop ensures you’re not boxed in as your demands grow. The upgrade process, however, is no beginner’s game, and I recommend consulting a professional unless you’re confident about opening up your device.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight and portable design, perfect for commuting professionals.  
- Excellent multitasking performance thanks to the 12th Gen Intel Core i3 and 16GB RAM.  
- Full HD display with anti-glare coating enhances the viewing experience.  
- Comprehensive connectivity features, including Wi-Fi 6 and multiple ports.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Plastic build feels less premium compared to pricier competitors.  
- Missing modern USB-C port, which is standard in similar devices.  
- Struggles with brightness in outdoor or overly sunny environments.  

**Product Competitors**  
When I compared the Inspiron to similarly priced laptops like the HP Pavilion 15 and Lenovo IdeaPad 3, a few differences stood out. The HP boasts slightly better build quality and an integrated fingerprint reader, but its default RAM is limited to 8GB, often requiring an upgrade for heavy users. The Lenovo IdeaPad 3, while more affordable, offers a lower-quality display that detracts from the multimedia experience. Dell’s winning hand here is its balance—the Inspiron sacrifices style for reliable performance, giving you a solid, no-frills productivity machine.

**Worth Every Penny**  
If you’re wondering whether it’s worth your investment, it really comes down to what you need. For standard users like me—those who need reliable performance for office work, studying, or running small businesses—this laptop holds its ground well. It isn’t the cheapest option available, but the combination of specs and upgradability gives it long-term staying power. However, those seeking a luxurious design or high-end gaming performance might want to explore other options.

  52 days until i turn 18  
  
  Bubblegum Pink is the nail polish of the day.  
  
  Matt Higgins will definitely like it—he’s into all things girly-girl, so I add another coat before blowing on my nails. Tonight we’re meeting at this field party, and I fully expect we’ll make out behind a hay bale or something.  
  
  Drew is lounging on my bed, reading Cosmo. “So I signed you up to be manager for my baseball team. ”  
  
  “What?!” Careful not to mess up my polish, I mute the TV and sit up to face him. “Why?”  
  
  “I can’t stand the idea of you holed up in your room while I’m playing ball this spring. You should come to practice tomorrow morning. ” He smells a perfume ad, cringes and sticks his tongue out.  
  
  My heart pounds faster than light speed. I hate baseball. I know, I know. That means I’m not a true American. It probably means I’m not human. But I gave up foam fingers, peanuts, and the Atlanta Braves when my mom announced she’s a lesbian and ran off with her friend who was more than just a friend. A year ago January, she divorced my dad, and I divorced her dreams of me playing softball for Hundred Oaks.  
  
  “No way,” I say, examining my nails.  
  
  “Come on, Parker!” He thumbs through the magazine. “Please?” he whines.  
  
  “What’s involved?” I try to act nonchalant, but Drew looks up with a knowing smile. He’s lived down the street from me my whole life—I’ll do anything for him.  
  
  “Taking stats and helping with equipment. ”  
  
  Taking stats is way easy. I could do it in my sleep.  
  
  “It’ll be a cinch,” Drew says, reading my mind. He shows me a cartoon couple using a dining room table for Kama Sutra maximum effect. “Jesus Christ,” he says. “Is that move physically possible?”  
  
  “Try it out with Amy and let me know. ”  
  
  He glances at me sideways, then turns the magazine vertical and studies it closely. “I’m flexible, but not that flexible. ”  
  
  “Can you imagine needing a hip replacement at seventeen? You could get a cane with flames painted on it. ”  
  
  “Or maybe one with skulls. ”  
  
  “Pirate ships!”  
  
  “Don’t change the subject…So there’ll be plenty of guys for you on the team. ” He snorggles. That’s our special word for snorting and giggling. It’ll be in Webster’s any day now.  
  
  I have to admit I love the way cute guys look in baseball uniforms. Plus, I’d get to spend more time with Drew. Lately, his idea of fun has been going to Jiffy Burger with Corndog and Sam Henry and acting like they’re the characters from Seinfeld, talking about nothing. Drew invites me along sometimes when they need an Elaine, because I’m really good at punching Corndog (George Costanza) and yelling “Get out!” and Drew says I dance worse than the real Elaine. But it’s been getting kinda old. How many times can those guys debate who has better fries: Sonic or Jiffy Burger?  
  
  And what else do I have to do this semester? It’s February, I’ve got a 4. 0, and classes don’t matter at this point—the only way Vanderbilt could revoke my early admission would be if I went on the news and advocated for Tennessee to secede from the union.  
  
  On the other hand, this could be a lot of work. I’d probably end up doing hard stuff like lugging water coolers around and washing dirty jockstraps or something.  
  
  On the other hand, I don’t want to be lonely.  
  
  Jockstraps it is.  
  
  When I was five, Mom discovered a recipe for homemade edible Play-Doh. We loved cooking together, especially fancy stuff like foie gras grilled cheese. We sat at the kitchen table, which was covered by the previous week’s comics, and mixed flour and sugar and peanut butter together and rolled it into shapes. I had dinosaur cookie cutters, so I made a Play-Doh T-Rex. Mom made a triceratops. I bit its head off, and she joked, “My little praying mantis. ” We giggled and giggled and gorged ourselves on that Play-Doh. The next day we went to church and Mom and I kneeled at the altar. As I prayed, I didn’t ask you for anything. I only thanked you for giving me Mom.  
  
  Written on February 12 before the party at Morton’s field. Burned using a candle.  
  
  On Saturday morning, Drew and I arrive at the baseball field behind Hundred Oaks High—aka the only place I dread more than Chuck E. Cheese (I worked there last summer and almost died because I had to wear a Crusty the Cat costume).  
  
  We step out of his red VW bug into the sun, and the crisp wind bites my face. I pull my arms up inside my fleece and begin the trek across the parking lot to meet the players, who are warming up by doing throwing exercises and sprints. I stare at the most popular guys at our school.  
  
  Popular-schmopular—any cute guy will do. Last Sunday after church? I hung out with this guy Aaron on the swings at the playground, listening to him talk about how much his school sucks (he goes to Woodbury High) and how Nirvana really is the best band ever. I disagree—I’m into modern stuff like Paramore and the All-American Rejects, but I couldn’t get a word in because he kept talking and talking and talking. Before he drove home with his parents, I let him kiss me beside the turtle sandbox thing, so people will know I like boys.  
  
  “Over here!” Coach Burns calls, beckoning us.  
  
  “Oh, dear me,” I croon to Drew. “Your coach is older than baseball itself. ”  
  
  “I think he coached my grandpa. ”  
  
  “And his grandpa. ”  
  
  “Everyone’s been saying he’ll retire after this year. Would you rather retire or work your whole life?”  
  
  “I’d retire tomorrow if I could, and I haven’t even started working yet,” I reply. “When you retire, would you rather spend time playing golf or bingo?”  
  
  “Golf. I love the outfits. Golf or polo?” he asks.  
  
  “Do you mean water polo or horse polo?”  
  
  “Water. ”  
  
  “Gross. I like animals much more than speedos. ”  
  
  Drew introduces me to the coach, who starts explaining my responsibilities. How I’ll be the official statistician because I make straight As in calc. (Coach did his homework. ) How I should always have the coolers filled with ice water before practices start, and how I should make sure the buckets by the pitching machines are loaded with balls. Drew snorggles at the mention of balls. Perv. I elbow him.  
  
  “You should always be thirty minutes early for practice. ” The coach clears his throat, and his lined face goes a bit pink. He glances at Drew, then back to me. “And if you decide to date or mess around with anyone on the team, you can’t be a manager anymore, okay?”  
  
  What? Kissing players is reason numero uno I’m willing to sit around watching these guys belch and adjust their crotches and spit in the dugout.  
  
  “Why?” I ask, scrunching my eyebrows.  
  
  “The girl who managed the team last year, uh, well, we had some incidents on the bus and in the locker room. ” He coughs. “I’m sure that won’t happen with you. ”  
  
  Does he think I’m incapable of getting guys? I kissed Matt Higgins behind a barn last night. Trust me, I’m capable of getting a guy.  
  
  I smooth my curve-enhancing blue fleece. I’m wearing leather boots over skinny jeans. It’s not sporty attire, but I once read this book called The Rules that said guys like girls who always look ready to go on a date, so I even wear lip gloss when jogging. The only thing I never bother fixing is my tangled waist-length brown hair. It may sound gross, but my hair looks good tangly—guys love it.  
  
  “No worries, Coach,” I say.  
  
  Coach tells Drew to warm up, so he runs off, his cleats clacking on the asphalt. “You should meet my new assistant coach and our new captain. Don’t take orders from any guys except the captain, understand?”  
  
  I nod, and Coach Burns calls out,  
“Hoffman! Whitfield! Get over here!”  
  
  Corndog, aka Will Whitfield, swings at a pitch, drops his bat, then jogs over. He must truly love baseball to smile in 40-degree February weather. He tosses away his batting helmet and runs his fingers through the brown waves of his hair before pulling his cap from the back pocket of his baseball pants.  
  
  “Hey,” he says, giving me a bright grin, showing off the dimple in his right cheek.  
  
  Yeah, yeah. I know you’re hot, Corndog. I fight the urge to roll my eyes. Thanks to all the years he’s spent baling hay on his dad’s farm, Corndog has gone from not to hot, from scrawny to sinewy, from geek to god, and now has to beat girls off with a stick. Not that he ever dates. Not that I’d ever hook up with him. He nearly became valedictorian instead of me.  
  
  “So…” he whispers, putting his hat on. “You and Higgins, eh?”  
  
  I pull my knit cap down over my ears and tell myself to ignore the queasiness. I didn’t enjoy kissing Matt Higgins very much. He kept trying to go up my shirt. “It was a one-night thing. ”  
  
  Corndog removes a batting glove. “Isn’t it always, for you?” He laughs, but it’s not a nice laugh, and gives me a hard stare. “You keep screwing with my friends. ”  
  
  I rub my neck. What he’s saying isn’t a lie. I do kiss guys a lot.  
  
  And I’d be lying if I said I’m not interested in snuggling or talking on the phone late at night, falling asleep talking to a boy I’m in love with. I do want a boyfriend. But I haven’t met any guys worth the risk of being ditched.  
  
  “Just do me a favor,” Corndog whispers. “Don’t mess with Bates. ”  
  
  I raise my eyebrows. I’ve never had that kind of spark with Drew. We had our diapers changed together. Besides, he’s been dating this sweet girl, Amy Countryman, for like half his life. She enjoys knitting and cooks him breakfast for dinner. But truth be told, I’m not entirely sure Drew likes only girls.  
  
  “You don’t have to worry about Drew,” I whisper.  
  
  “Thanks. ” Corndog nods.  
  
  “Would you two like to join us sometime today?” Coach Burns says, motioning toward the field. “I want Parker to meet the new coach. ”  
  
  That’s when a baseball rolls up to my boots.  
  
  “Sorry! Foul ball,” Sam calls from home plate, clutching his bat.  
  
  I scoop up the ball, wind my arm, and hurl it from the parking lot and over the fence to shortstop.  
  
  “Wow,” a voice says. “She’s got a hell of an arm. ”  
  
  I turn slowly, and that’s when I first see him.  
  
  His tan face is thin with stubble and a strong jaw. He’s a couple inches taller than my 5'7"". He’s wearing gray baseball pants, an oversized black sweatshirt cut off at the elbows, and a frayed beige ball cap. Dark curls sneak out from under the brim. His big brown eyes meet mine and my breath sputters.  
  
  “Hi,” Beautiful Boy says, stretching out a hand. “I’m Brian Hoffman, the new assistant coach. ”  
  
  “Parker Shelton. ”  
  
  Somehow I shake his hand and squeak out my name. Names, names. Brian & Parker sounds like a law firm. Parker & Brian sounds like a pharmaceutical company. His calloused palm feels rough against mine. I picture him touching my hair.  
  
  “Do you play softball?” Coach Hoffman asks me, smiling. He raises an eyebrow.  
 “No. ”  
  
  “You should try out. ”  
  
  I’m still shaking his hand. Longest Handshake of All Time. Maybe we can shake hands until practice is over and then I’ll ask if he wants to hang out.  
  
  Wait. This guy’s a coach. How old is he? Twenty-one? Twenty-two?  
  
  I release his hand and wipe my tingling palm on my jeans. Corndog’s shaking his head at me. Coach Hoffman beckons for us to follow him onto the field. My pulse races as I cross the fresh chalk of the first base line. This is the first time I’ve stepped foot on a diamond in a year.  
  
  We meet the team at home plate, where Coach Hoffman tells them I’m the new manager. The guys crowd around me, saying stupid things like “Parker Shelton, woooo!” and “I love you, Parker!” and “Parker Shelton, I want to have all your babies!” and I shove my hands in the pockets of my fleece, glancing between the guys and the ground. Normally I’d be grinning, but I don’t want Bri—I mean, Coach Hoffman seeing me act desperate.  
  
  Coach Burns takes this moment to tell the guys to keep their hands off me or risk getting suspended for two games. Then he leads the pitchers to the outfield for long toss.  
  
  “Coach Burns must really be pissed about last year,” Paul Briggs says under his breath to Sam, but loud enough for me to hear. Paul plays catcher, and his weight rivals that of an orca whale. He gestures at me. “Sucks we won’t be getting hot managerial play. Everyone knows she puts out. ”  
  
  “Shut up, man,” Sam says, slapping Paul with a glove.  
  
  Corndog glares at Paul. “Apologize now. ”  
  
  Paul shrugs. “Sorry. ”  
  
  “Don’t be an ass,” Coach Hoffman tells Paul, grabbing him by a sleeve. “Five laps. ”  
  
  Paul throws him a look of hatred but takes off ambling around the field. Paul’s not even capable of jogging.  
  
  I toe the ground, wishing someone would squash me into the red clay.  
  
  Coach Hoffman steps closer, his face turning rosy. Freckles dot his nose. His lips are chapped. Does he bite them?  
  
  He whispers, “I’m sorry about that. ”  
  
  “No big deal,” I say, folding my arms across my chest. I want to tell him that I don’t technically put out. I’m still a virgin. Honestly, I still have problems using tampons. They just don’t work for me. I even studied this diagram in Seventeen that gave tips on how to get them in, but I can’t figure out the logistics. And sometimes trying to figure it out makes blood rush to my head and I feel like I might pass out and I can only imagine Dad finding me in the bathroom, unconscious next to the toilet, pants-less with a tampon in my hand.  
  
  As if I’d ever ask my mother for tampon tips.  
  
  Coach Hoffman directs the JV guys to the batting cages and sends the varsity onto the field, to scrimmage. He adjusts his beige cap, looking at me. “Let’s go over how to take stats, okay?”  
  
  “Okay, sounds great. ” Not that I need help with stats. I’m so good, I bet the Braves would hire me. But he doesn’t have to know that.  
  
  Coach Hoffman goes on, “I’ll need you to take stats at practices too. I’m in charge of the lineup, so accurate stats are crucial to my decision-making process. ”  
  
  His decision-making process? Crazy mature.  
  
  “Okay, Coach. ”  
  
  “Coach?” He lets out a ripple of laughter. “I don’t think I’ll ever get used to kids calling me coach or mister. ”  
  
  He thinks of us as kids? “How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking?” My voice shakes.  
  
  He pauses. “I’m twenty-three. Just finished up my master’s in phys ed at Georgia Tech. ”  
  
  He’s a complete adult. He’s six—one, two, three, four, five, six—years older than me. “What class are you teaching?”  
  
  “Gym, but I’m not sure what my schedule is yet. ” He pulls his cap off and puts it back on. He chomps on his gum. “They hired me to take over the baseball team for Coach Burns when he retires next year. ”  
  
  “So it’s true?”  
  
  Coach Hoffman nods. “I’m in training this season. ”  
  
  As far as coaching goes, working at Hundred Oaks in Franklin is an impressive job to have. Our Raiders usually make it to the district tournament, if not further.  
  
  “You must know your baseball,” I say.  
  
  He gives me a long serious look. I see his Adam’s apple shift as he swallows. “Something like that. ”  
  
  “Did you play?” I ask.  
  
  “Something like that. ” His face goes hard.  
  
  “They must call you Cryptic Coach Hoffman. ” We haven’t taken one step away from home plate.  
  
  “I’m never gonna get used to being called coach. Seriously. ”  
  
  I laugh lightly. “How about a nickname?”  
  
  “Such as?” He raises his eyebrows.  
  
  I stuff my frozen hands in my armpits. “The Hoff?”  
  
  “Isn’t that David Hasselhoff’s nickname?”  
  
  “Perhaps. ”  
  
  “So you’re equating me with that movie star guy who gets trashed and videotapes himself drunk and eating cheeseburgers?”  
  
  “Exactly. ”  
  
  “Back in high school they called me Shooter. ”  
  
  “Why? Are you a deer hunter or something?”  
  
  “Uhhh, you don’t want to know what it means. ” The side of his mouth quirks up.  
  
  I rock back and forth on my heels. “I like the Hoff way better. ”  
  
  He smiles at me. “If you’re gonna call me the Hoff, I’m gonna give you a nickname too. ”  
  
  “Such as…?”  
  
  “Trouble. I’ll call you Trouble. ”  
  
  “Cliché. ”  
  
  “Touché. ”  
  
  We start laughing.  
  
  “God, this is the silliest conversation I’ve had in ages,” he says with a smile.  
  
  Yeah, probably because you’re an adult and I’m a child, and how could an adult possibly have a normal mature conversation with a girl? I gaze down at the red clay beneath my boots, then look up into his brown eyes and sneak a glimpse at the loose curls peeking out from under his hat. Are they soft?  
  
  I say, “Fine, you can call me Trouble. And I’m still gonna call you the Hoff. ”  
  
  His face contorts into this blend of pain and amusement. “Call me Brian,” he says quietly. “I’m not ready to be called coach or mister. I’m not ancient. ”  
  
  “Brian. ” I like the way it sounds coming off my tongue. Full and deep. His mouth slides into a smile, and I catch him quickly scanning my body.  
  
  He leads me over to the dugout, picking up a stick along the way. We sit down. He hands me a pencil and the stats book, which looks like a large, floppy sketchpad. Boxes of tiny field grids fill the inside pages. I bring the stats book to my nose and inhale the smoky gray paper.  
  
  Brian laughs softly and uses the stick to clean clay out of his cleats. “You must really like baseball. Smelling the stats book and all. ”  
  
  “Smelling books is a habit Dad got me started on. ”  
  
  “There are worse habits. ” Brian shows me his fingernails. He’s bitten them down to the quick. How personal. It’s not like I openly show people my super-long second toes.  
  
  “You ever taken stats before?” he asks. I like his voice. Low, Southern, manly.  
  
  “Sort of,” I say, tracing my palm. “Dad is a big Braves fan. ” Was a big Braves fan.  
  
  “Me too. ” He goes back to picking wet clay and grass out of his cleat. “What’s your team?”  
  
  “Braves, I guess. ” I want to keep talking to him. I can do this. I can talk about baseball again. When my family was still together, we loved heading down to Atlanta on weekends to catch games, especially when they played the Phillies and the Mets.  
  
  Mom played softball in high school, and then went on to play shortstop for the University of Tennessee. Before she ditched us, I played softball too. I loved it. But last January, when she left and moved to Knoxville with Theresa, our family was embarrassed to the nth degree. Everyone at church gave us funny looks on Sundays during Coffee Time in the Fe  
llowship Hall, which is a fancy way of saying we eat stale donuts in the church basement. I don’t even know why we kept going to church.  
  
  “But why would we want to hang out with those jerks who judge us because of something Mom did?” I had cried to Dad.  
  
  “It’s just a phase. They’ll forget about it. ”  
  
  “But—”  
  
  “We are not negotiating this,” he replied, studying the newspaper.  
  
  “Are we going to atone for Mom’s sins?” my older brother asked.  
  
  “Becoming a lesbian is a sin?” I replied.  
  
  “I’m not sure. People at church think so. ” Ryan sucked on his bottom lip.  
  
  “Does it actually say that in the Bible? Thou shalt not become a lesbian?”  
  
  “No,” Dad said with a sigh, his eyes closed.  
  
  “Then why are we going to church?” I blurted. Phase or not, how the congregation turned on us didn’t seem forgivable.  
  
  “We trust in prayer,” Dad replied. His father believes in prayer. So did his grandfather.  
  
  Church means dressing up on Sunday mornings and forgoing French toast at the kitchen table for stale powdered donuts. It means listening to Brother John saying “Your body is a temple” and “True love waits,” and then we all would say we’ll wait until we get married to have sex. Or at least until college.  
  
  Some people at church thought I might turn out like my mom. A lesbian. A sinner. I overheard the youth pastor whispering that to the choir director. Brother John told Mrs. James that they would always love me, but he and his wife had to protect their daughter, Laura (my former best friend), from making similarly bad choices. I went home and hid all my pictures of Mom and cried and cried.  
  
  But that made me feel worse, because I knew Mom adored me, and no matter how hard she had tried to hide it, we could tell she was depressed. Before she left Dad, sometimes I came home from school and found she’d been crying.  
  
  I used to love church, but I turned away from it like they turned on me. I shouldn’t have been surprised. After Tate Gillam’s dad got caught doing his secretary, my own dad told me not to hang around Tate and his sister Rachel anymore.  
  
  When I confronted Laura about what her dad had said, that I might turn out like my mom—a lesbian, a sinner—we got into a huge fight because I said her father wasn’t being a good Christian toward me. Laura asked, “What do you know about being a Christian? You knew I liked Jack Hulsey. When you turned him down to the Winter Wonderland formal, you could’ve put in a good word for me. But you only care about yourself and proving you’re better than me. ”  
  
  So untrue.  
  
  Our frustrations had been building up for a long time anyhow, so she didn’t take it well when I called her a jealous bitch. The words popped out and I wanted to take them back, but I couldn’t.  
  
  Then Laura spread a rumor around school, saying I’m just like my mom. A butch softball player who probably likes girls.  
  
  Apparently “love thy neighbor” changes to “judge thy neighbor” if your family doesn’t follow the church playbook.

Quick Summary: 4 days 3 nights 36lbs

I’m planning on doing the great range traverse starting from Rooster Comb (splitting it to two days) stay at Snobird, and then heading up and over to Algonquin on day 2, down to Colden and then staying night 2 at Panther Gorge, day 3 heading down and over to the Pinnacle trail, staying at Elk Pass and hiking back to Rooster Comb day 4. 

Most of what I am bringing with me is necessities including my bear canister, and one luxury item (Helinox Chair Zero) 

36lbs seems a bit heavy, but I’m packing very few clothes. This is with all my food and 2.5 liters of water. I don’t really want to shed the Helinox because having a chair has been a game changer. I’m not overpacking or bringing anything unnecessary. I do hava a pair of camp shoes packed (Teva Hurrane XLT2) but that’s it. 

Uhg, I know people have recommended base camping but I really want to make this circuit. 

Thoughts?

Anything I’m missing, or anything I should shed? Does 36 starting lbs seem reasonable for such a traverse? This was about my pack weight when I spent several days at Pictures Rocks and Isle Royale NP and other trips, but I wasn’t dealing with nearly as much elevation there. I suppose I could also drop pack or bring an ultralight stuff able day pack like the ultrasil to do peaks once I’m up on the ridge? ",3,1755201087.0,Adirondacks,1,1.0,False
1mqb6kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mqb6kq/offtheclock_training_or_no_check/,off-the-clock training or no check?,"Location: CT, USA
So my job has a tendency to do things I'd describe as 'shady,' but I'm not well versed in law so I thought I'd check here for this one — I work at a chain coffee shop that posts training/readiness videos in their portal for the employees to watch to keep up with product changes. Our manager usually gives us a warning 5-1 days in advance that we have to watch them (off the clock and at home, usually) or our checks will be held at a different store in another nearby town and we'll have to go there to pick them up/watch the videos (assumedly still off the clock). Since we're hourly employees and this is training that they consider mandatory, is it illegal to ask us to do it on our own time or else have our paychecks withheld, or is this just another thing they can get away with doing even if it sucks?",1,1755201061.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1mqb3u5,https://i.redd.it/4nr0niivg1jf1.png,A news app that improves your mental health and productivity [50% off annually],"Hi!  I’ve never shared this side of our story before, but I hope this encourages people to keep building and shipping.

Tldr – I launched a news app that improves your mental health and now I’d like to give back.

**The App:**

It’s called Goodable.  Think of it like Headspace meets Apple News.  It curates 100% verified, positive news from around the world. Key features:

* Personalized newsfeed designed to improve your mental health
* Thousands of verified, positive stories - updated daily
* Up to 12 user-selected categories 📱
* 4.9-star rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
* Audio sessions from top coaches, newsmakers, and influencers 🔊

**How it Started:**

I’m a war correspondent and realized that people are exhausted by the constant negativity on their newsfeeds, so I built a daily good news app from my kitchen table. We launched as the #4 downloaded app of the day in the health/wellness category.  Thank you so much to everyone for helping us get there!

**The Turning Point**

People started messaging me to say the app had helped them overcome their anxiety and depression. I’ve always believed that news has the power to change our psychology, so I commissioned two clinical trials to prove it.  They showed that our app could reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression by as much as 64% on first exposure.  

Today, people from dozens of countries use Goodable to stay positive everyday. I feel like I’m living a dream.

**The Ask:**

I’d love it if you tried the app!  As a way to say thank you, I’m offering everyone on this sub 50% off our premium annual subscription.  It works out to $1.87/month - less than the price of a coffee (there's also a 100% free tier as well).  Just reply in the comments and I’ll send you a promo code. 

If you know someone who struggles with negativity or depression, please share this with them.  It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole of bad news, and I would like to help as many people as possible.  Thank you!",2,1755200894.0,ProductivityApps,0,1.0,False
1mqb21a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1mqb21a/seizures_of_cannabis_smuggled_into_germany_have/,Seizures of Cannabis Smuggled Into Germany Have Risen 50% Despite Reforms,"When the Cannabis Act came into force in Germany, the aim was to improve the country’s drug policy by changing the way the popular recreational drug was handled. The black market was to be curbed, youth protection strengthened, and the health of consumers better protected through legal access.

Unfortunately, not all of the plans that were originally envisaged could be implemented, and neither the supply of cannabis in social clubs nor telemedicine can meet the demand among the population.

As a result, a large proportion of consumers are still being served by illegal street dealers. Although some of this cannabis is grown in hidden facilities in the country, a great deal of black market goods continue to come from abroad. Because certain countries have moved towards a more liberal policy, it seems understandable that attempts are being made to smuggle cannabis into Germany from these regions.

As was already announced in June, customs authorities have seized a record amount of smuggled cannabis since partial legalisation last year. Cannabis smuggling into Germany is now becoming increasingly common.

# Cars, trains and planes

In June, Federal Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil (SPD) presented the [latest annual customs statistics in Hamburg](https://www.zoll.de/DE/Presse/Zolljahresstatistik_2024/_functions/faq_5_btm.html?nn=261424&faqCalledDoc=261424), which revealed a surprising result.

While cannabis has been legalised in parts of the country, the cultivation of three plants has been permitted, and cannabis social clubs have been allowed, the smuggling of the most popular previously illegal intoxicant into Germany has also increased significantly.

The amount seized has risen by almost four tonnes compared to 2023, which represents an increase of around 50%. A total of 12,618 kg was found by customs, compared to 8,642 kg in the previous year.

All kinds of transport are used for smuggling: cars, trains and planes. As reported by [Welt.de](https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article256223890/Der-grosse-Irrglaube-nach-der-Cannabis-Legalisierung.html), specialists at the General Customs Directorate highlighted a connection between the sharp increase in cannabis smuggling and partial legalisation in Germany, and see this as at least one of the reasons for the increase in quantity.

According to a customs spokesperson, greater public interest in cannabis could mean that ‘smaller quantities are being brought into circulation more frequently and are therefore being detected more often’.

It could be that more people are under the misconception that importing cannabis into the country is now legal, leading to an increase in the number of people attempting to smuggle cannabis in their cars, on trains or in their luggage on planes. However, it is clearly emphasised that this is not permitted. The import, export and transit of cannabis remains prohibited and punishable by law.

# Small quantities from the Netherlands, larger quantities mostly from Spain

One key driver behind cannabis imports is the considerable difficulty of obtaining it legally in Germany. Though there are now just under 300 licensed social clubs nationwide, approval processes remain protracted, and even once licensed, each club may only supply up to 500 members.

Scientifically monitored pilot programmes—which could expand access to a broader population—are still awaiting implementation. For many, cultivating cannabis at home is impractical, time-consuming, or technically challenging. As a result, it’s often easier to travel to countries with more relaxed regulations, purchase the product there, and then attempt to bring it back into Germany by land.

Smaller amounts frequently originate from neighbouring Netherlands, long known for its coffee shop culture. Larger shipments, however, tend to follow routes from Spain via France.

Customs authorities, reporting to the Finance Ministry, note that seizures now exceed four tonnes, but they cannot clearly distinguish whether this reflects more widespread small-scale trafficking. Nor, according to their own statements, is it possible to make ‘statistically reliable statements about a connection between increased cannabis seizures and the partial legalisation in 2024.’

# Thailand, Canada, USA

Other sources, including Thailand, Canada, and the United States, are also thought to contribute to these numbers, mainly via imports by sea and air.

Legalisation efforts in these countries have made cannabis more accessible and, in turn, appear to have driven up illegal imports into Germany. Still, customs cannot provide reliable data pinpointing what volumes come from each country.

As the first evaluation of the Cannabis Act approaches this autumn, political opponents may seize on these developments as a new argument against liberalisation.

It will be telling whether, as the Federal Government’s Drug Commissioner Hendrik Streeck puts it, ‘evidence-based and scientifically sound policies’ prevail—especially given that the current restrictions make the legal access landscape for cannabis far from ideal.

1mqayn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearShifted/comments/1mqayn1/explore_the_best_electric_mountain_bike_ancheer/,Explore the Best Electric Mountain Bike ANCHEER Offers and See If It Delivers,"Testing the ANCHEER AMAK00026 electric bike over the last few weeks has been an eye-opener. It's marketed as an electric mountain bike that fits both commuters and trail enthusiasts, so I had to see if it lived up to the hype. With a lightweight aluminum frame, a removable 48V/374Wh battery, and multiple riding modes, this bike promises a blend of utility and adventure. Trust me, I put it through its paces, and while it packs a lot of punch, there’s more to it than meets the eye.

**Build Quality and Design**  
Right out of the box, the first thing that struck me about this electric bike was how well-built it looked. The aluminum alloy frame is both lightweight and sturdy, combining practicality with durability. Weighing around 50 pounds, it’s not absurdly heavy but feels stable when riding, even off-road. The front suspension fork is lockable, giving you flexibility depending on whether you’re navigating pavement or rougher trails. I noticed the design incorporates a PX54 waterproof rating, making maintenance on rainy days less of a hassle—a thoughtful touch, especially when dealing with electric components. The 26-inch wheels with double-walled aluminum rims add to its robustness, and let’s not overlook the aesthetic appeal of this blue beauty. It’s simple, yes, but refined where it counts.

**The 4 Driving Modes and Versatility**  
This bike boasts four riding modes, and, trust me, I tried all of them. Pedal Assist Mode (PAS) adds just enough torque when pedaling, making climbing moderate hills nearly effortless. Its Throttle Mode allows you to zip around town without pedaling, something I shamelessly used after my third coffee. Cruise Mode lets you fix your speed with just a long press of a button—an underrated feature for extended flats. You can also revert to Pure Pedal Mode if you’re up for some good old-fashioned leg work. Each mode is easily adjustable via the LCD display, which feels intuitive and user-friendly.

**Performance on Various Terrains**  
This machine doesn’t play around. The peak 750W motor provides a hearty push, easily handling steep inclines on trails—though I wouldn’t say it’s made for hardcore mountain biking. I clocked its top speed at around 22mph, and the motor support felt consistent and reliable. On longer commutes, the pedal assist combined with the 21-speed transmission system allowed incredible versatility. From gravel paths to smoother urban roads, the transition was seamless, but I would’ve loved more rear-suspension support for bumpier outings. It’s clear the front suspension is doing all the heavy lifting.

**Battery and Range**  
The removable 48V/374Wh battery is arguably one of this bike’s most appealing features. After testing, I found the advertised range of up to 55 miles reasonable—though mileage dipped slightly when using higher levels of pedal assist continuously. Having a removable battery means you’re not stuck charging the bike in a specific location, which is a lifesaver if you’re short on outlets in your garage or apartment. Bonus tip: Always carry the charger with you on longer rides; you never know when you might want to top up.

**Safety and Control**  
While I had fun riding this electric bike, safety isn’t compromised. The front and rear disc brakes worked exceptionally well, offering solid stopping power that inspired confidence, even in less-than-ideal conditions. Coupled with a responsive LCD screen showing speed, gear, and battery level, monitoring my ride felt reassuringly high-tech. However, I did notice the plastic seat wasn’t the most comfortable on long trips, so investing in a cushier replacement might be a smart move.

**Strengths**  
- Lightweight yet sturdy aluminum alloy frame  
- Four versatile riding modes to suit various scenarios  
- Disc brakes with reliable stopping power  
- Removable battery simplifies charging  
- LCD display easy to read and navigate  

**Areas of Weakness**  
- Seat comfort could be better for extended use  
- Rear-suspension support is lacking for tougher trails  
- While assembly is straightforward, it’s still a time commitment  

**Product Contenders**  
The ANCHEER AMAK00026 faces stiff competition from brands like RadPower or Aventon, which also offer electric bikes with powerful motors and similar price ranges. Compared to RadPower models, this bike wins on affordability and accessibility, given the straightforward nature of its design and components. Conversely, RadPower bikes might offer greater customizability and more advanced features, making them more appealing for tech enthusiasts. Aventon, on the other hand, excels in design and aesthetics, but its price sometimes feels steep for casual riders. The ANCHEER strikes an excellent balance between cost and utility while maintaining decent looks and enough power for most riders.

**Cost Efficiency**  
I’ve seen pricier electric bikes that don’t offer as many features as this one. The removable battery, multiple speed settings, and throttle mode alone make it a worthwhile investment. Sure, there are areas that could use improvement, like the seat’s cushioning and handling on rough terrain, but those can often be fixed with minor upgrades. If you’re looking for a practical yet adventurous option that doesn’t break the bank, this bike is a strong candidate.

☕[Tip Jar](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page.

1mqayb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1mqayb3/i_made_100_this_week_just_testing_random_apps_on/,I Made $100 This Week Just Testing Random Apps on My Phone—Is This the Easiest Side Hustle Hack Ever?! 🤯,"Okay, so... I’m not sure if I just HACKED the system or what because this week was INSANE. 

Literally, I’m just lounging on my couch, aimlessly scrolling, when I stumble onto **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. I honestly thought it was another typical “get paid for nothing” scam.

But, wait—nope. NOT a scam. 

You probably want proof, and honestly, *same*, because I still can’t believe what happened. 🤯

Here’s exactly what I did to make $100—all from my phone:

- Clicked on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and signed up in like 60 seconds  
- Downloaded a list of super random, legit apps  
- Opened them, tried their features (one app literally wanted me to make a sandwich in-game, not even kidding?)  
- Each completed “test” dinged my balance UP $2-$7

My expectations? Zero.

My current vibes? Shocked AND hyped.

FAQ if I were you (and me, tbh):

- “Is this a pyramid scheme?”  
NO, I didn’t invite anyone, and there weren’t sketchy popups—just straight app tests.

- “How long did each test take?”  
Honestly, between 4 and 10 minutes. Sometimes not even that (I tested a weather app by tapping around twice).

- “The payout... is real?!”  
Yup. Cashed out to PayPal. Got the $$. I wish I’d recorded my *astonished face*. Not clickbaity at all.

The weirdest part: I started for giggles, figuring it would fizzle out fast—like everything else. But each time, my account balance nudged higher. 

A micro side hustle that had me genuinely confused! Like, why doesn’t everyone know about **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**?

Not everything is perfect. A few tips:

- Pick the newest apps—they tend to pay more for feedback  
- Check back daily, new tasks pop up all the time  
- Don’t lie in reviews. They seriously boot you for that.

Week’s end, I hit $101.37.

I honestly thought the cash would vanish, but, against all belief, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** *followed through*.

How is this not viral?

I’m sitting here, stunned, realizing my idle scroll time actually paid for all my coffee runs this week. And now my friend group is convinced I’ve become some digital *side quest boss* or something. 😂

So, yeah, I’m as confused and shocked as you probably are reading this. If you need a little cash and have a smidge of spare time, I really don’t see a downside to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

My question: anyone else out there tried it? Was your mind equally blown or did I just catch a lucky week? 

Let’s compare stories—because there’s NO way I’m actually the only one creeping into surreal side gig territory!",1,1755200554.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False

I moved to London not so long ago, fascinated by the English culture from its rich history and traditions to the fact that people actually queue for fun (a true art, honestly). London’s diversity and endless cultural mix were big reasons too, and now that I’m feeling more settled, I’d love to meet some new friends and explore beyond just figuring out which Tube line confuses me the least.

I’m doing my PhD in Educational Leadership with a focus on Gen AI and working in higher education sector. Basically, I love learning, reading, teaching, and deep conversations. Outside that, I’m into discovering hidden gems, museum-hopping, musicals, and soaking in those “London moments” that make you feel like you’re in a movie.

If you’re up for a coffee, drinks, a scenic walk, theatre, stand ups, a gallery visit, or just a good laugh about how unpredictable this weather is, drop a comment or DM. Always happy to connect with great people and share some London adventures! 😊

*By Your Favorite AI Sportswriter Who Still Can’t Kick a Straight Line*

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s cut through the noise. The odds here scream that **Nice** is the favorite, with decimal prices hovering around **2.10** (implied probability: \~47.6%). Toulouse, meanwhile, sits at **3.60** (\~27.8%), while the draw checks in at **3.30** (\~30.3%). For context, those numbers are like a math test given by a teacher who *loves* trick questions—Nice has a solid edge, but the draw isn’t a total long shot.

The spread market adds intrigue: Nice is favored by **-0.25 goals** at **1.81**, meaning they’re expected to win or at least avoid a loss by a hair. Toulouse (+0.25) is priced at **2.03**, a nod to their underdog status. The totals market? A meager **2.5 goals** is the threshold, with **Under** slightly favored (**1.82**) over Over (**2.02**). Translation: This could be a game where the most dramatic thing is a missed penalty, not a hat trick.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and Why Toulouse’s Defense Feels Like a Sieve

Let’s talk about the humans (and chaos) behind the numbers.

**Nice** enters this clash with their star striker, **Bryan Dabo**, fully fit after a minor “hamstring injury caused by tripping over his own shoelaces during a midnight snack run.” Ouch. But hey, at least his recovery time gave him ample opportunity to master the art of cereal consumption in zero gravity. The rest of the squad? Unscathed, with their midfield maestro **Jean-Ricner Bellegarde** still operating at 110%—or as fans call it, “the speed of a sloth on a coffee IV.”

**Toulouse**, on the other hand, is a hot mess. Their defense looks like a group of sleepwalkers playing Jenga while blindfolded. Key center-back **William Pavoni** is out with a “mysterious knee injury,” allegedly sustained while attemptin

1mqauyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1mqauyr/used_to_be_a_fan_but_officially_done_with/,Used to be a fan but officially done with Starbucks bc of new CEO,"Ok so Im a huge coffee fan. I worked at startbucks as a barista back in the hay day of jokes about opening another Starbucks in the bathroom of a Starbucks. 
The new CEO policies are so tone deaf and pointless. Making the dress code more strict. Making baristas write little personal messages on a cup. Also from ordering to service now must be 4 minutes?
This let's me know Brian Niccol, to be blunt, doesn't know a damn thing about how his business ACTUALLY works. Drinks at Startbucks don't take a long time to make because employees are slacking off. Its because some of them take multiple ingredients that customers are encouraged to customize.  On top of that Barnstable are supposed to come up with something clever and personalized to write on the cup?  

Again to be blunt, its just bat shit crazy. I just can't keep going to a place that put me off first by union busting. Now they are trying to make up lost ground by literally giving employees a task that is impossible about 75% of the time? 

‐-------

CEO #1: We want things to go back to how they used to be!

CEO #2: I know, let do everything the exact opposite of how things used to be! Then things will definitely go back to being how they used to be!

CEO #1: That's genius! I think we deserve more coke as a reward!

  This is close enough. Thanks,"" I said to the cabdriver, and he swerved to park a block from Carew Tower's drop-off zone. It was Sunday night, and the trendy restaurants in the lower levels of the Cincinnati high-rise were busy with the March Madness food fest-the revolving door never stopped as laughing couples and groups went in and out. The kids-on-art exhibit had probably brought in a few, but I'd be willing to bet that the stoic pair in the suit and sequined dress getting out of the black car ahead of me were going up to the revolving restaurant as I was.  
  
  I fumbled for a twenty in my ridiculously small clutch purse, then handed it over the front seat. ""Keep the change,"" I said, distracted as I tugged my shawl closer, breathing in a faint lilac scent. ""And I'm going to need a receipt, please. ""  
  
  The cabbie shot me a thankful glance at the tip, high maybe, but he'd come all the way out to the Hollows to pick me up. Nervous, I readjusted my shawl again and slid to the door. I could have taken my car, but parking was a hassle downtown for festivals, and tawny silk and lace lost a lot of sparkle while getting out of a MINI Cooper. Not to mention the stiff wind off the river might pull apart my carefully braided hair if I had to walk more than a block.  
  
  I doubted that tonight's meeting with Quen would lead to a job, but I needed all the tax deductions I could get right now, even if it was just cab fare. Skipping filing for a year while they decided if I was a citizen or not hadn't turned out to be the boon I originally thought it was.  
  
  ""Thanks,"" I said as I tucked the receipt away. Taking a steadying breath, I sat with my hands in my lap. Maybe I should go home instead. I liked Quen, but he was Trent's number one security guy. I was sure it was a job offer, but probably not one I wanted to take.  
  
  My curiosity had always been stronger than common sense, though, and when the cabbie's eyes met mine through his rearview mirror, I reached for the handle. ""Whatever it is, I'm saying no,"" I muttered as I got out, and the Were chuckled. The thump of the door barely beat the three loud Goth teenagers descending upon him.  
  
  My low heels clicked on the sidewalk and I held my tiny clutch bag under my arm, the other hand on my hair. The bag was small, yes, but it was big enough to hold my street-legal splat gun stocked with sleepy-time charms. If Quen didn't take no for an answer, I could leave him facedown in his twelve-dollar-a-bowl soup.  
  
  Squinting through the wind, I dodged the people loitering for their rides. Quen had asked me to dinner, not Trent. I didn't like that he felt the need to talk to me at a five-star restaurant instead of a coffee shop, but maybe the man liked his whiskey old.  
  
  One last gust pushed me into the revolving door, and a whisper of impending danger tightened my gut as the scent of old brass and dog urine rose in the sudden dead air. It expanded into the echoing noise of a wide lobby done in marble, and I shivered as I made for the elevators. It was more than the March chill.  
  
  The couple I'd seen at the curb were long gone by the time I got there, and I had to wait for the dedicated restaurant lift. Hands making a fig leaf with my purse, I watched the foot traffic, feeling out of place in my long sheath dress. It had looked so fabulous on me in the store that I'd bought it even though I couldn't run in it. Wearing it tonight was half the reason I had said yes to Quen. I often dressed up for work, but always with the assumption that I'd probably end the evening having to run from banshees or after vampires. Maybe Quen just wanted to catch up? But I doubted it.  
  
  The elevator dinged, and I forced a smile for whoever might be in it. It faded fast when the doors opened to show only more brass, velvet, and mahogany. I stepped inside and hit the R button at the top of the panel. Maybe my unease was simply because I was alone. I'd been alone a lot this week while Jenks tried to do the work of five pixies in the garden and Ivy was in Flagstaff helping Glenn and Daryl move.  
  
  The lobby noise vanished as the doors closed, and I looked in the mirrors, tucking away a strand that had escaped the loose braid Jenks's youngest kids had put it in tonight. If Jenks were here, he'd tell me to snap out of it, and I pulled myself straighter when my ears popped. There were ley line symbols carved into the railing like a pattern, but they were really a mild euphoric charm, and I leaned backward into them. I could use all the euphoria I could get tonight.  
  
  My shoulders had relaxed by the time the doors opened and the light strains of live chamber music filtered in. It was just dinner, for God's sake, and I smiled at the young host at the reception desk. His hair slicked back, he was wearing his uniform well. Behind him, Cincinnati spread out in the dark, the lights glinting like souls in the night. The stink and noise of the city were far away, and only the beauty showed. Maybe that's why Quen chose here.  
  
  ""I'm meeting Quen Hanson,"" I said, forcing my attention back to the host. The tables I could see were full of people taking advantage of the festival's specials.  
  
  ""Your booth isn't ready yet, but he's waiting for you at the bar,"" the man said, and my eyes flicked up at the unexpected sound of respect in his voice. ""May I take your shawl?""  
  
  Better and better, I thought as I turned to let him slip the thin silk from my shoulders. I felt him hesitate at my pack tattoo, and I straightened to my full height, proud of it.  
  
  ""This way, please?"" he said as he handed it to a woman and took the little paper tag, handing it to me in turn.  
  
  I let my hips sway a little as I fell into step behind him, making the shift to the revolving circle without pause. I'd been up here a couple of times, and the bar was on the far side of the entry. We strode through tables of upscale wining-and-dining people. The couple who had come up ahead of me were already seated, wine being poured as they sat close together and enjoyed each other more than the view. It had been a while since I'd felt that, and a pang went through me. Shoving it down, I stepped to the still center portion of the restaurant with the brass and mahogany bar.  
  
  Quen was the only one there apart from the bartender, his stance hinting at unease as he stood, not sat, with a ramrod straightness in his suit coat and tie. He had the build to wear it well, but it probably hampered his movement more than he liked, and I smiled as he frowned and tugged at his sleeve, clearly not seeing me yet. The reflection in the glass behind the mirror showed the lights on the river. He looked tired-alert but tired.  
  
  His eyes were everywhere, and his head cocked as he listened to the muted TV in the upper corner behind him. Catching the movement of our approach, he turned, smiling. Last year I might have felt out of place and uncomfortable, but now I smiled back, genuinely glad to see him. Somehow, he'd taken on the shades of a father figure in my mind. That we kept butting heads the first year we'd known each other might have something to do with it. That he could still lay me flat out on the floor with his magic was another. Saving his life once when I had failed to save my dad probably also figured into it.  
  
  ""Quen,"" I said as he needlessly tugged his dress slacks and suit coat straight. ""I have to say this is better than meeting you on the roof. ""  
  
  The hint of weariness in his eyes shifted to warmth as he took my offered hand in a firm grip to help me onto the perch of the bar stool. Tired or not, he looked good in a mature, trim, security sort of way. He was a little short for an elf, dark where most were light, but it worked well for him, and I wondered if that was gray about his temples or a trick of the light. A new sensation of contentment and peace flowed from him-family life was agreeing with him, even if it was probably also why he was tired. Lucy and Ray were thirteen months and ten months, respectively. As Trent's security adviser, Quen was powerful in his magic, strong in his convictions . . . and he loved Ceri with all his soul.  
  
  Quen made a sour, amused face at the reminder of our first meeting at Carew Tower. ""Rachel, thank you for agreeing to see me,"" he said, his low, melodious voi  
ce reminding me of Trent's. It wasn't an accent as much as his controlled grace extending even to his speech. He looked up as the bartender approached and topped off his glass of white wine. ""What would you like while we wait?""  
  
  The TV was just over his head behind him, and I looked away from the stock prices scrolling under the latest national scandal. My back was to the city, and I could see a hint of the Hollows beyond the river through the bar's mirror. ""Anything with bubbles in it,"" I said, and Quen's eyes widened. ""It doesn't have to be champagne,"" I said, warming. ""A sparkling wine won't have sulfates. ""  
  
  The bartender nodded knowingly, and I smiled. It was nice when I didn't have to explain.  
  
  Quen leaned in close, and I caught my breath at the scent of cinnamon, dark and laced with moss. ""I thought you were going to order a soft drink,"" he said, and I set my purse on the bar beside me.  
  
  ""Pop? No way. You dragged me all the way into Cincy for a meeting at a five-star restaurant; I'm getting the quail. "" He chuckled, but it faded too fast for my liking. ""Usually,"" I said slowly, fishing for why I was here, ""when a man invites me somewhere nice, it's because he wants to break up with me and doesn't want me to make a scene. I know that's not the case here. ""  
  
  Silent, he tightened his jaw. My pulse quickened. The bartender came back with my drink, and I pushed it around in a little circle, waiting. Quen just sat there. ""What does Trent want me to do that I'm not going to like?"" I finally prompted, and he actually winced.  
  
  ""He doesn't know I'm here,"" Quen said, and his slight unease took on an entirely new meaning.  
  
  The last time I'd met Quen without Trent knowing about it . . . Dude! ""Holy crap, did you get Ceri pregnant again? Congratulations! You old dog! But what do you need me for? Babies are good things!"" Unless you happen to be a demon, that is.  
  
  He frowned, hunching over the bar to sip his drink and shooting me a look to lower my voice. ""Ceri is not pregnant, but the children do touch on what I wanted to talk to you about. ""  
  
  Suddenly concerned, I leaned closer. ""What is it?"" I said, a flicker of anger passing through me. Trent could be a dick sometimes, taking his ""saving his race"" quest to unfair extremes. ""Is it about the girls? Is he pressuring you about something? Ray is your daughter!"" I said hotly. ""She and Lucy being raised together as sisters is a great idea, but if he thinks I'm going to sit here while he shoves you out of their life-""  
  
  ""No, that's far from the truth of it. "" Quen set his drink aside to put his hand on mine. My words cut off as he gave my hand a warning squeeze, and when I grimaced, he pulled away. I could knock him flat on his ass with a curse, but I wouldn't. It had nothing to do with the fancy restaurant and everything to do with respect. Besides, if I knocked him down, he'd knock me down, and Quen had a spell lexicon that put mine to shame.  
  
  ""Ray and Lucy are being raised with two fathers and one mother. It's working beautifully, but that's what I wanted to discuss,"" he said, confusing me even more.  
  
  I drew my hands back to my lap, slightly huffy. So I had jumped to conclusions. I knew Trent too well, and pushing Quen out of the picture to further the professional image of a happy, traditional family wasn't beyond him. ""I'm listening. ""  
  
  Avoiding me, Quen downed a swallow of wine. ""Trent is a fine young man,"" he said, watching the remaining wine swirl.  
  
  ""Yes . . . "" I drawled, cautiously. ""If you can call a drug lord and outlawed-medicine manufacturer a fine young man. "" Both were true, but I'd lost any fire behind the accusations a while ago. I think it was when Trent slugged the man trying to abduct me into a lifetime of degradation.  
  
  Quen's flash of irritation vanished when he realized I was joking-sort of. ""I have no issue in having a secondary public role in the girls' lives,"" he said defensively. ""Trent takes great pains to see that I have sufficient time with them. ""  
  
  Midnight rides on horseback and reading before bed, I imagined, but not a public show of parenthood. Still, I managed not to say anything but a tart ""He gives you time to be a dad. Bully for Trent. "" I took a sip of bubbly wine, blinking the fizz away before it made me sneeze.  
  
  ""You are the devil to talk to, Rachel,"" he said curtly. ""Will you shut up and listen?""  
  
  The sharp rebuke brought me up short. Yes, I was being rude, but Trent irritated me. ""Sorry,"" I said as I focused on him. The TV behind him was distracting, and I wished they'd turn it down even more.  
  
  Seeing my attention, he dropped his head. ""Trent is conscientiously making sure I have time to be with both Ray and Lucy, but it's becoming increasingly evident that it's caused an unwise reduction to his own personal safety. ""  
  
  Reduction to his own personal safety? I snorted and reached for my wine. ""He's not getting his fair share of daddy time?""  
  
  ""No, he's scheduling things when I'm not available and using the excuse to go out alone. It has to stop. ""  
  
  ""Ohhhh!"" I said in understanding. Quen had been keeping Trent safe since his father had died, leaving him alone in the world. Quen practically raised him, and letting the billionaire idiot savant out of his sight to chat with businessmen on the golf course probably didn't sit well. Especially with Trent's new mind-set that he could do magic, too.  
  
  Then I followed that thought as to why I might be sitting here, and my eyes got even wider. ""Oh, hell no!"" I said, grabbing my purse and shifting forward to get off the stool. ""I am not going to do your job again, Quen. There isn't enough money in the world. Not in two worlds. ""  
  
  Well, maybe in two worlds, but that wasn't the point.  
  
  ""Rachel, please,"" he pleaded, taking my shoulder before I could find the floor. It wasn't the strength of his grip that stopped me cold, but the worry in his voice. ""I'm not asking you to do my job. ""  
  
  ""Good, because I won't!"" I said, my voice hushed but intense. ""I will not work for Trent. He's a . . . a . . . "" I hesitated, finding all my usual insults no longer holding force. ""He never listens to me,"" I said instead, and Quen's hand fell from my shoulder, a faint smile on his face. ""And gets himself in trouble because of it. I got him to the West Coast for you, and look what happened!""  
  
  Quen turned to the bar, his voice flat. ""His actions resulted in a bar burning down and the collapse of a US monument. ""  
  
  ""It wasn't just a bar, it was Margaritaville, and I'm still getting hate mail. It was his fault, and I got blamed for it. And let's not forget San Francisco getting toasted. Oh! And how about my ending up in a baby bottle waiting for my aura to solidify enough so that I could survive? You think I enjoyed that?""  
  
  Granted, the kiss to break the spell had been nice, but the last time I worked for Trent, the assassins had been aimed at me.  
  
  Upset, I turned back to the bar's mirror. My face was red, and I forced myself to relax. Maybe Quen was right to bring me here. If we had been at Junior's, I probably would be halfway out the door looking for my car. Even angry as I was, I looked like I belonged here with my hair up and my elegant dress that made me look svelte, not skinny. But it was all show. I didn't belong here. I was not wealthy, especially smart, or talented. I was good at staying alive-that's it-and every last person up here save Quen would be the first to go if there was trouble. Except maybe the cook. Cooks were good with knives.  
  
  Quen lifted his head, the wrinkle line in his forehead deeper. ""That's exactly what I'm saying,"" he said softly. ""The man needs someone to watch him. Someone who can survive what he gets himself into and is sensitive to his . . . quirks. ""  
  
  ""Quirks?"" Frustrated, I let go of my clutch purse and downed another swallow of wine. ""Dude, I hear you. I understand,"" I said, and Quen blinked at my word choice. ""I even sympathize, but I can't do it. I'd end up killing him. He's too pigheaded and unwilling to consider anyone else's opinion, especially in a tight situation. ""  
  
  Quen chuckled, relaxing his tight grip on his emotions. ""Sounds familiar. ""  
  
  ""We are talking about Trent, not me. And besides, the man does not need a babysitter. He's all grown up, and you""-I pointed at Quen-""don't give him enough credit. He stole Lucy okay, and they were waiting for him  
. "" I turned back to the bar and the reflection of the Hollows. ""He can handle whatever Cincinnati can dish out,"" I said softly, going over my short list of trouble. ""It's been quiet lately. ""  
  
  Quen sighed, slumping beside me with both hands around his drink, but I wasn't going to fall for it. ""I will admit that Trent has a knack for devising a plan and following through with it. But he falters at improvisation, and that's where you excel. I wish you would reconsider. ""  
  
  Hearing the truth of it, I looked up and Quen lifted his drink in salute. Trent could plan his way out of a demon's contract, but that wouldn't keep him alive against a sniper spell, and that's where the real danger was. My jaw clenched and I shoved the thought away. What did I care?  
  
  ""I left the I. S. because I couldn't stomach working for anyone. That hasn't changed. ""  
  
  ""That's not entirely true,"" he said, and I frowned. ""You work with Ivy and Jenks all the time. ""  
  
  My eyebrows rose. ""Yes. I work with Jenks and Ivy, not for them. They don't always do what I think is best, but they always at least listen to me. "" I didn't do what they thought was best, either, so we got along tolerably well. Trent, though, he needed to listen. The businessman made more mistakes than . . . me.  
  
  ""He's doing much better,"" Quen said, and I couldn't stop my chuckle.  
  
  ""Yeah?""  
  
  ""He worked with Jenks,"" Quen offered, but I could hear the doubt in his voice.  
  
  ""Yes, he worked with Jenks,"" I said, the wine bitter as it slipped down. ""And Jenks said it was like pulling the wings off a fairy to get Trent to include him on even the smallest details. No. ""  
  
  Quen's worry line in his brow was deepening. ""Quen, I understand your concern,"" I said, reaching out to put a hand on his arm. It was tense, and I pulled back, feeling like I shouldn't have touched him. ""I'm sorry, but I just can't do it. ""  
  
  ""Could you maybe just try?"" he said, shocking me. ""There's an elven heritage exhibit at the museum next Friday. Trent has a few items on display and will be putting in an appearance. You'll love it. ""  
  
  ""No. "" I faced the mirror and watched myself take a drink.  
  
  ""Free food,"" he said, and I eyed him in disbelief through the reflection. I wasn't that desperate. ""Lots of contacts with people with too much money,"" he added. ""You need to get out and network. Let Cincy know you're the same Rachel Morgan who captured a banshee and saved San Francisco, and not just the witch who's really a demon. ""  
  
  I flushed, setting the glass down and looking around for a clock. Jeez, had I only been here ten minutes?  
  
  ""I expect you would pick up a few legit jobs,"" he said, and I stiffened. I wasn't out of money, but the only people who wanted to hire me wanted me because I could twist demon curses. I wasn't that kind of a girl, even if I had the potential to be, and it bothered me that Quen knew who had been knocking on my door. Working a couple of easy chaperoning jobs for Cincinnati's elite would do wonders for my esteem.  
  
  Isn't that what Quen is offering me?  
  
  ""There would be a clothing allowance,"" Quen wheedled. My pulse quickened, not at the thought of a new pair of boots but at being dumb enough to consider this. ""Rachel, I'm asking this as a personal favor,"" he added, sensing me waver. ""For me, and Ceri. ""  
  
  Groaning, I dropped my head into my hand, and my dress pinched as I shifted to turn away from him. Ceri. Though she had agreed to maintaining a public image with Trent, she loved Quen. Quen loved her back with all the fierceness of someone who never expected to find anything beautiful in the world. Hell, if it was nothing more than being a security escort, I could stomach Trent for a few hours. How much trouble could the man get into out at the museum, anyway?  
  
  ""You fight dirty,"" I said sourly to his reflection, and he toasted me, smiling wickedly.  
  
  ""It's my nature. So will you do it?""  
  
  I rubbed the back of my neck as I turned to him, guilt and duty pulling at me. Avoiding him, I sent my eyes to the TV. It was showing the Cincy skyline, which was odd since it was a national station. The banner THIRD INFANT ABDUCTED flashed up, then vanished behind an insurance commercial. Act as Trent's security? I thought, remembering Trent's savage, protective expression under the city when he downed that man trying to abduct me. And then how he looked on my front steps when he found Wayde carting me out of the church over his shoulder. Trent had spun a charm to knock the Were out cold with the ease of picking a flower. True, it hadn't been needed, but Trent hadn't known that.  
  
  My fingers spinning the footing of my glass slowed as I recalled Trent opening up to me and telling me about the person he wanted to be. It was as if I was the only person who might really understand. And Quen wanted me to be the one to deny him that?  
  
  ""No,"" I whispered, knowing that Trent would count my presence as his failure. He didn't deserve that. ""I'm not going to be his babysitter. ""  
  
  ""Rachel, you need to put your petty grudge aside and-""  
  
  ""No!"" I said louder, angry now, and his words cut off. ""This isn't about me. Trent can stand on his own. He's better than you give him credit for. You asked me, I said no. Find someone else to spit in his eye. ""  
  
  Quen pulled back from me, his face creased in anger. ""That's not what I'm doing,"" he said, but there was a whisper of concern in his denial. ""I simply don't want him out there alone. There's nothing wrong with someone having your back. He can stand on his own without having to be alone. ""  
  
  Behind him, the TV was showing the front of Cincy's hospital, lit up with lights and security vehicles. Have his back?  
  
  ""I won't bring it up again,"" he said, shifting away from me, suddenly closed off. ""I think our table is ready. ""  
  
  Confused, I slid from the stool, shimmying until my dress fell right. If I was there, Trent wouldn't see it as me watching his back. He'd say I was babysitting him. Quen had it wrong.  
  
  Didn't he?  
  
  ""After you,"" Quen said sourly, gesturing for me to follow the man standing before us with two huge menus in his hand.  
  
  God save me from myself, maybe Quen was right. ""Quen . . . ""  
  
  But then my gaze jerked up to the TV over the bar as I caught a familiar phrase, and my thoughts of Trent vanished. With a sudden flash, I recognized the new Rosewood wing behind the newscaster on the scene. The Rosewood wing was simply a fancy name for the three comfortable houselike facilities they'd built for the terminally ill babies suffering from Rosewood syndrome. The cul-de-sac was damp from the earlier rain, and lights from the I. S. cruisers and news vans made everything shiny. The thought of THIRD ABDUCTION echoed through me, and I jerked to a halt. Behind me, Quen grunted in surprise.  
  
  ""Turn it up!"" I exclaimed, turning back to the bar and shoving past Quen to get closer.  
  
  "". . . apparently abducted by a kidnapper posing as a night nurse,"" the woman was saying, and I felt myself pale. ""I. S. officials are investigating, but so far they have no leads as to who is taking the failing infants, and why. ""  
  
  ""Turn it up!"" I said again, and this time, the bartender heard me, aiming a remote and upping the volume. I felt myself pale as Quen rocked to a halt beside me, both of us looking up. A phone buzzed, and Quen jumped, his hand fumbling to a back pocket.  
  
  ""Because of baby Benjamin's miraculous progress in fighting the lethal disease, officials are not hopeful for a ransom demand-they fear that he was taken by unscrupulous biogenetic engineers trying to find and sell a cure. ""  
  
  ""Oh my God,"" I whispered, fumbling in my clutch bag for my phone. They'd killed all the bioengineers during the Turn. It was a tradition both humans and Inderlanders alike gleefully continued to this day. That I was alive because of illegal tinkering didn't make me feel any better.  
  
  ""Let's hope they find them soon,"" the woman was saying, and then the headlines shifted to the latest Washington scandal.  
  
  Head down over my phone, I punched in Trent's number. It would go right to his private quarters, bypassing the switchboard. I felt hot, then cold, my grip on my phone shaking. He wouldn't have abducted the baby, but he'd have a short list of who might have. The Humans Against Paranorma  
ls Association, HAPA, maybe, now that they couldn't have me. Trent had once promised that he'd give the demons the cure to their infertility, but after suffering through the chaos wrought by his father's saving me, I couldn't believe that Trent was looking to increase the number of survivors just yet.  
  
  The busy signal shocked through me, and I glanced up at the shadow of a man standing too close: Quen, his brow furrowed as he looked at his phone's screen. Blinking, I remembered where I was. Quen's lips twitched, and he held out his phone. It was smaller and shinier than mine. ""He's on my line,"" he said with a thin, distant voice. ""You talk to him. ""  
  
  Fingers shaking, I took the phone. ""He'll know we're together, that we talked. "" Oh God, I didn't want Trent to know that Quen doubted him. He looked to him as his father despite the monthly stipend.  
  
  Quen shrugged. ""He'll find out anyway. ""  
  
  Mouth suddenly dry, I answered the phone and put it to my ear. ""Trent?""  
  
  The hesitation was telling, but he caught his balance quickly. ""Rachel?"" Trent said, clearly surprised. ""I'm sorry. I must have hit the wrong button. I was trying to reach Quen. ""  
  
  I held the phone tighter, my pulse pounding. His voice was beautiful, and I felt glad for turning Quen down. ""Ahh,"" I said, glancing up at a stoic Quen. ""You hit the right number. ""  
  
  Again Trent hesitated. ""Okay?""  
  
  ""We were having dinner. "" I explained nothing, and Quen's face became even more bland. ""Quen and I. You saw the news? Do you know who did it?""  
  
  My worry came rushing back, crowding out my brief flash of pleasure for having caught Trent off guard. It happened so seldom. The host was still waiting, and when Quen shook his head, he smiled ingratiatingly and walked away, dropping the menus on the bar.  
  
  ""No, but I'm going out there right now. "" Trent's tone was tight, and my idea that he was fixing Rosewood babies died. ""Since you're with Quen, would you both meet me there?""  
  
  My lips parted, even as I heard the accusation in his tone. He wanted me there? With him?  
  
  ""Rachel, are you there?"" Trent asked, and I flushed, glancing at Quen before pushing the phone tighter to my ear.  
  
  ""Yes. The hospital, right?"" Where all the news vans were? Swell. I couldn't help but wonder if his invitation was because he wanted my professional opinion or simply to find out what Quen and I were doing.  
  
  ""Rosewood wing,"" he said, his tone grim. ""I doubt there will be any indication as to who took the infant, but I don't want evidence to be buried if the I. S. doesn't like what they find. If one of us is there, we will at least have the truth. ""  
  
  I nodded as Quen exchanged a few words with the bartender and slipped him a bill. The I. S. was an offshoot of the original FBI and local police forces before the Turn, responsible for hiding Inderland crimes before humans could find evidence that witches, werewolves, and vampires existed. Covering up the uncomfortable or unprofitable was in their blood.  
  
  ""Rachel, may I talk to Quen?"" Trent asked, shaking me out of my thoughts.  
  
  ""Um, sure. I'll see you there. "" My stomach was in knots, and I held the phone out. ""He wants to talk to you. ""  
  
  Quen looked at the phone, his expression never shifting as he reluctantly reached out. Turning sideways to me, he drew himself up. ""Sa'han?"" He hesitated. ""Having dinner. "" Another pause. ""Of course Ceri knows. It was her idea. ""  
  
  Ceri was in on this, too? Frowning, I forced my arms from my middle. Trent would be pissed. I knew I'd been when my mom and dad rented me a live-in personal security guy for a few months.  
  
  ""No,"" Quen said firmly, and then again, ""No. I'll see you there. ""  
  
  I could hear Trent complaining as Quen closed the phone, cutting him off midprotest. That wasn't going to go over very well, I decided, and when Quen gestured for me to head out before him, I meekly fell into place, my thoughts turning to the hospital.  
  
  Behind us people laughed and clinked glasses. Below, Cincinnati moved with her people, uncaring and unaware. It felt wrong now. Someone was stealing Rosewood babies. The ""why"" was ugly.  
  
  Quen was silent all the way to the elevator. He avoided my eyes as I handed him my ticket to give to the coat-check woman. I could have given it to her myself, but high society came with weird rules, and it was no skin off my nose. ""You're not going to tell him?"" I said, hoping he wanted to use the time it would take to get to the hospital to come up with some story other than Quen's asking me to babysit Trent.  
  
  Gaze distant in thought, Quen shook out my shawl and I turned around, my head lowered. ""You might be right,"" he said, and I shivered as the silk settled over my bare skin. ""I may have acted without thought. ""  
  
  It was an honest answer, but Quen might be right as well. Trent didn't need a babysitter, but everyone needed someone to watch their back.  
Chapter Two  
  
  Quen's car was warm, the seats heated and my vents aimed at me, making the escaping strands of my braid tickle my neck as we slowly wove through the twisty hospital campus. Feeling ill, I leaned toward the dash and peered through the curved glass, both anxious to get there and uncertain as to what I was going to tell Trent. It was starting to mist, and everything had a surreal glow. The tall main building looked foreboding in the rain, lights gleaming on its slick walls. That was not our destination. People got better-mostly-at the hospital. Where we were headed, the only healing was emotional.  
  
  The tires hissed on the wet pavement as we took a tight corner into a cul-de-sac. Three modest structures, identical apart from their color, were before us, I. S. cruisers and black Crown Vics parked in the drives and at the curbs. My lips curled in disgust at the news vans, bright lights spilling out along with heavy wires like grotesque umbilical cords running into one of the houses. It must have made their night to have their local story picked up nationwide.  
  
  The three two-story homes looked out of place in the otherwise institutional hospital setting. They were relatively new, the landscaping bushes still small and inadequate. It was Cincinnati's Rosewood wing where Rosewood babies were moved to, sometimes born here, but always dying here, never surviving. A lot of parents elected to take their baby home for his or her last days, but not all, and the homey atmosphere was a boon. Counselors were more prevalent than nursing staff. They hadn't had such a place when I'd been born, and as Quen parked his two-seater into a space too small for the official cars, I felt odd and melancholy.  
  
  Quen put the car in park, making no move to get out. I, too, leaned back into the plush seat, afraid almost. Blowing his breath out noisily, Quen turned to me. ""I'm going to tell him we had dinner and talked about his security,"" he finally said, his eyes holding a hint of pleading. ""I'm also going to tell him that I was asking your opinion if he was secure on his own merits, and that you said he was, but that if the situation changed that you would . . . ""  
  
  My heart thumped as he let his words trail off into expectation, waiting for me to finish his sentence and tell him I'd watch Trent when he couldn't. That wasn't even mentioning the little white lie. I didn't know how I felt about that, and I searched Quen's expression. The shadow-light coming from the lit-up building made him look older, his worry clear. Damn it all to hell. ""That if the situation changed that I'd be able to assist in keeping the girls safe,"" I said firmly, and Quen's expression became stoic.  
  
  ""Very well, Tal Sa'han,"" he grumbled, and my eyebrows rose. Tal Sa'han? That was a new one. I would have asked him what it meant, but his voice had been mocking.  
  
  ""Then let's go,"" I said, reaching for my bag. The little clutch bag felt too small as I got out, and my clothes were totally inappropriate for a crime scene. The cool mist touched my face, and the thump of Quen's door surprised me. Dropping my eyes to the damp pavement, I shut my door as well.  
  
  I took a deep breath and lifted my chin, starting for the door, already propped open for the sporadic flow of people in and out. I couldn't help but notice the opening was almost twice as wide as usual. I hated oversize doors-or rather, I hated the wheelchairs they alluded to. A sudden wish to be anywhere but here struck me. I had escaped dying from Rosewood syndrome. It had taken almost all my early life to do it and it shaped me in ways I was only now figuring out, but the reminder was bittersweet.  
  
  Quen met me stride for stride. ""Are you okay?""  
  
  We had gained the paved walk, which artistically meandered to give the appearance of distance and interest. It just looked fake to me. ""Fine,"" I said, my mood growing worse. I didn't want to be here-didn't like the memories being stirred up. Someone was stealing Rosewood babies, and what followed from there was enough to make my nights sleepless.  
  
  Head down, I stepped over the news van's cords, walking sideways to get through the door and flashing my ID to the I. S. guy. I think it was more Quen's and my fancy dress that got us in than my ID. The officer clearly didn't recognize me, but only someone who needed to be here would come dressed in formalwear. I'd have to remember that.  
  
  The cool night mist vanished, and I hesitated just inside the wide entryway, feeling Quen's silent, solid presence behind me. A set of stairs led up, probably to the nurses' quarters; the kitchen was behind the stairway, down a short hallway. There were two living rooms, one to either side of the door. Both of them were full of people standing around talking, but only one had the lights of the news crews. It was warm, even for me, and I didn't like the excited tone of the newswoman asking the distraught mother how she felt now that her baby-thriving against all odds-had been stolen.  
  
  ""What a slime,"" I whispered with a surge of anger, and Quen cleared his throat. Someone had pieced together that the Rosewood syndrome was actually an expression of too much demon enzyme and was ""harvesting"" demon blood while the babies still lived. I'd be dead, too, if Trent's father hadn't modified my mitochondria to supply the enzyme that blocked the lethal action of the first enzyme that actually invoked demon magic. It was a mouthful that basically meant he'd enabled me to survive being born a demon.  
  
  Quen's hand cupped my elbow, and he gently pulled me out of someone's way. Numb, I looked for a familiar face-somewhere to start. My evening dress was garnering odd looks, but it also kept people away. That stupid newscaster was still interviewing the parents, and I. S. agents stood at the outskirts hoping to get some airtime. No one recognized me, thank God, and I felt guilty for being surrounded by so much grief-grief that my parents had endured and triumphed over. Damn it, I would not feel guilty for having survived.  
  
  ""There he is,"" Quen breathed in relief, and I followed his gaze to the back of the living room to the hallway running from the nurseries to the kitchen.  
  
  ""And Felix,"" I said, surprised to find Trent talking to the undead vampire. Or rather, he was talking to Nina, the young vampire that Felix currently liked doing his aboveground talking through. The young woman was looking thinner than the last time I'd seen her, better dressed and confident, but decidedly peaked, as if she'd been on too many amphetamines for the last four months. It was hard to see her behind the suave, collected undead vamp controlling her body, living through her for a few hours at a time.  
  
  It was about what I had expected. Serving as an undead master's mouthpiece wasn't safe for either party-the old vampire was reminded too strongly of what it was like to be alive and began to pine for it, and the young was given more power running through his or her mind and body to handle alone. It was a knife's edge that only the most experienced attempted at this level, and I was starting to think that the relationship had passed the point where it could be ended safely.

1mqat8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1mqat8v/launched_my_first_live_django_application/,Launched my first live Django application,"Hello Fellow Developers,

About 4 months ago I decided to learn Django after too many headaches with Node.js. Initially, I built a couple small projects dorm tutorials to get a feel for the language… I loved Django after making these. This has been a project I’ve been working on the side, away from my full-time job. After months of late nights, coffee, and headaches, I just launched my very first live Django application!

It’s a project I’m passionate about and have been quietly building: a blog platform based on Major League Baseball where fans can post, upvote, and discuss — with a gamified twist that tracks user engagement like a leaderboard. I’m using it to run my own MLB-themed site right now, but the platform is designed so anyone could spin up their own blog community.

A few things I learned along the way:

The “80/20 rule” is real. The first 80% of features came together fast; the last 20% (SEO, responsiveness, edge cases) took way longer than expected.

Django’s ORM is magic for managing complex relationships. Tracking upvotes, comments, and team stats across multiple models was surprisingly smooth without raw SQL.

Deployment humbled me. Going from local dev to production meant wrestling with static files, configuring a production DB, and setting up automated tasks for content generation.

SEO isn’t an afterthought. Adding meta tags, structured data, and a good robots.txt early saved me headaches later.

Gamification needs balance. Leaderboards and upvotes are fun, but tuning them to encourage quality contributions (not spam) is an ongoing process.

What’s next:

Opening the platform so anyone can create their own sports blog community with a custom theme and features.

Creating different templates for blog posts (daily game recaps, weekly recaps, comedy/satire posts, and heavy analytics posts)

Adding more advanced community tools like badges, reputation scores, and automated highlight reels.

Expanding the stat-tracking system.

Integrating more micro-interactions (charts, live scores, real-time leaderboards).

Live site: [MLBWeeklyAI](https://www.mlbweeklyai.com)

It’s very much a work in progress, but it’s live, and people can actually use it which still feels surreal.

If anyone’s thinking about starting their first Django project, I’d love to answer questions or share some “I wish I knew this earlier” tips.

Thanks to everyone here who unknowingly helped through old Reddit threads, Stack Overflow posts, and of course ChatGPT. You’ve all been part of this journey without even knowing it. ❤️

I love visiting the city, the riverwalk is one of my happy places. I'm down to BS and talk at home, down to go for a bike ride or go kayaking. I'm not a drinker, although I'm fine if you are (not really into the alcoholic party type of people at this point though). I do smoke weed from time to time, but I can take it or leave it and it definitely doesn't have to be involved in the hangout if you don't want.

I occasionally see people say that concerns of cross contact in regards to oat milk contamination at coffee shops is not something to be overly concerned with, but I feel like that would be a big deal pretty quickly especially if it was a regular habit as getting coffee often is.

Basically, some companies want to run outreach from *real* LinkedIn accounts (not fake or brand-new ones). It helps them get more replies and avoids the “cold spam” vibe. So they pay people to let them use their profiles for a set period of time (in this case it is 3 months at a time).

Here’s how it worked for me:

* I signed up, they vetted my profile.
* Once approved, I gave them access to my LinkedIn profile for the 3 month period.
* I get a small payment every month just for letting them run messages through my account.

I’m getting $50/month, plus extra when I refer friends who get approved.  
The commitment is short-term (mine’s 3 months), and they handle all the tech/security stuff so I’m not worried about losing my account.

Obviously, it’s not a replacement for a job, but for doing *literally nothing* extra, it’s been an easy win.

Most of my tuition and living expenses were covered by a student loan, and I had to figure out how to manage money on my own. At first, it was overwhelming. I was worried about making mistakes with my credit card, paying bills late, or hurting my score without even knowing it.

I started small. I paid my student loan on time, used my credit card for small everyday purchases like groceries and coffee, and always paid it off in full. I kept track of my spending, learned about credit utilization, and tried to understand how credit scores actually worked.

It wasn’t instant, but over time, I saw my score improve. I realized that building credit is about being consistent and responsible, not just about spending money. I started keeping a simple tracker for my bills, payment dates, and spending, which helped me avoid late payments and understand how each action affected my credit. Checking my progress regularly gave me confidence that I was making smart financial choices and helped me plan better for things like renting an apartment or applying for a small loan in the future.

Not perfect, but I felt genuine love from her and toward her. We went through a lot—long distance for a year, cultural differences, and personal challenges.

About 5 months ago, I admitted I was still using a substance I’d promised to quit at the start of our relationship. She had told me back then that it was the one dealbreaker for her, but she didn’t leave right away. Instead, she got me help and said she needed time to think about the relationship.

Fast forward to 2 months ago—right before a pivotal licensing exam for my career—I made some bad decisions. Shortly after, she had my pregnant sister relay that she didn’t care anymore and blocked me on everything. She’s always been avoidant, so I understood why she chose to end things like that, and I understand why she left. But I still believe it’s a mistake.

Weeks later, I found out she commented something flirtatious on a stranger’s brand-new TikTok account (a man doing pullups). That broke me. I could understand wanting to break up and cutting contact, but moving on so quickly after a half-decade together hurt deeply. This was the person I wanted to marry and spend my life with.

Since early July, I’ve made massive changes:

* Quit alcohol, coffee, nicotine, and gaming/solo entertainment.
* Work out 3x a week; do hiking, swimming, yoga, Pilates, sit-ups, etc., on off days (recovering from a torn Achilles).
* Eat only healthy home-cooked meals except for social occasions (no fast food).
* Doing intermittent fasting, tracking calories, aiming for a healthy weight (currently 240 lbs, 6’7”, goal 260 lbs).
* Slowly transitioning toward vegetarian/vegan.
* Clean and organize my home weekly, dishes immediately, maintain routines she encouraged like not sitting on the bed with outside clothing.
* Actively working on emotional control, respectful communication, and honesty in all aspects of life, which has probably been the hardest part, for example with terms and conditions and white lies.
* Focused on my legal career and crafts (whittling, crochet, painting, leather work, writing, etc.).
* Seeing a professional to process emotions.

She influenced many of these changes, and I still hear her “voice” in my head guiding me. I even wrote her a handwritten letter with a wax seal I carved myself when I dropped off her belongings. The last time I saw her, she didn’t even slow down to talk—just said “why are you following me” and gave a thumbs-up when I told her I’d be dropping off her things.

Part of me still believes there’s a chance—if she could see who I am now, she might come back. I truly believe no one could love her the way I do, and I’d be ready to forgive everything. I know she might be seeing or have been with other people, but I think we’re perfect for each other.

Friends and family keep telling me to let go and move on. But how do you move on from the love of your life? How do you stop thinking about them daily? Am I holding onto something unhealthy here, or is it normal to feel this way after such a big loss?",1,1755199222.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I feel like a lot of allo people don't view friendships as relationships, or if they do, they view them as something lesser. Like, bitch, you still have to text back. You have to schedule time to hang out and maybe get each other little gifts all the same. 

I have gotten coffee with so many people. I have joined interest groups (and quickly exited them because ✨some men love being creeps✨), and sat there just hoping for a text back. Whenever I try to throw some kind of house party or do any kind of event, half the people flake. This shit makes me want to stay home and self-isolate so bad even though I know that's a terrible idea. Sometimes it just feels like I can't even go anywhere because I'm not coupled up. Traveling outside my city just isn't feasible for me because it's expensive solo and not exactly safe. 

Even the people who do seem to want to put in the effort usually stop when they get into relationships. It's like, cool, I'm happy for you and all, but damn. It sucks to know that something so important to me is the last priority for literally everyone else. I don't even have the fall back of being friends with my exes like a lot of the queer people I know seem do. I literally don't understand how I'm supposed to find friends, let alone any kind of QPR, under these conditions. 

My quest for friendship did let me join a knitting club that was mostly just old ladies for a bit though (listen, I was just hoping I could meet other queer girls who like yarn, idk), 10/10. Felt slightly less insane and got decades of concentrated gossip. ",10,1755198850.0,asexuality,2,1.0,False

1mqa3p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mqa3p7/a_casual_comment_from_my_best_friend_from/,A casual comment from my best friend from elementary school opened a rabbit hole. Now I wonder if I am even truly worth anything to my own family.,"When I was younger, I heard from my best friend that his parents saw my dad’s then-wife once fought my pregnant mom before I was even born. I didn’t think much of it at first, but over the years, as I dug deeper, the pieces started coming together.

I grew up in a broken, conservative household where “traditional family roles” and hierarchies were everything. My dad cheated on his first wife with my mom, who at the time was a single mother fresh out of a relationship with her alcoholic husband. The affair was a huge scandal in their social circles, full of arguments, fights, blackmail, and drama that went on for years.

From what I’ve gathered from different people, my dad’s marriage had already been strained. His ex-wife wanted kids, but he didn’t. She eventually convinced him by promising, *“Just give me kids, I’ll raise them myself.”* He reluctantly agreed, but after having twins, she broke that promise. My dad, feeling trapped, met my mom at her coffee shop. They clicked instantly and started an affair.

Things stayed hidden until my mom got a bad sinus infection. My dad took her to the hospital, and when her family came to visit, they found out about the relationship. That’s when everything exploded.

At one point, my mom even inseminated herself using a condom from my dad, despite him not wanting more kids, making the same “I’ll raise them myself” promise his ex-wife once made. Unlike his ex, she kept her word, but my dad eventually left his wife for her.

But life together didn’t turn out as they imagined. They separated when I was three, no official divorce  but my dad moved out. He still provided for me financially and spent time with me one-on-one. My mom shut down her coffee shop and became a full-time caregiver for me and my much older stepbrother.

**Mom did love us in her own way, but her definition of love was mostly about putting food on the table**. She grew up dirt-poor in the countryside, moved to the city with nothing, and carried the burden of supporting her entire family. She was hardworking but also blunt, controlling, and emotionally immature.

She was often narcissistic toward me and my brother. My brother took most of the physical beatings growing up, but he eventually became just like her in personality, **short-tempered and controlling**. I became his target: **constant “joking” punches to the head, nitpicking, and bullying**. Mom would yell at him when I cried, but that only made him angrier. Over the years, the stress left me with **OCD, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts none of which they ever acknowledged was their fault**.

Two years of therapy finally gave me some breathing room. My brother ignored me, and mom stopped being such an emotional child at least for a while. Friends and teachers gave me the support I desperately needed.

Then came 12th grade, and everything crumbled again. University was approaching, my mom was back to her old ways, and I was barely holding it together. My step-aunt, who had ignored everything for years, finally had a one-on-one convo with me about all this, then turned around and told everyone. Step-aunt called me an **ungrateful narcissist**. My grandma told me to *“get the hell out”* of the house. Truth is, they never liked me. I’d wanted to leave for years, but as a dependent kid, I had nowhere to go.

Now I’m starting university. My social circle has scattered. The one foreign tycoon I was close with and who promised me a job has suddenly ghosted me. My relationship with my family is worse than ever. I have no real social skills, no clear career direction, and no “marketable” talents except maybe working in an academic environment. I feel like I’m standing at the edge of adulthood with nothing and no one to catch me. **I now let time pass nihilistically with no real goal or ambition nor the will to make anything out of life.**",2,1755198719.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Not just pleasant, but as if you've stumbled into some hidden layer of reality where everything feels cinematic and significant? I experience this with:  

Hyper-Specific Magical Settings:

Hotels are my ultimate sensory wonderland:
- The click of the keycard door unlocking  
- The hum of the AC unit
- The muffled orchestra of sounds: ice machine crunching, elevator dings, laughter through walls as people pass
- The smells: chlorine, linen, stale lobby coffee, plastic-wrapped soap bars  
- Tactile stuff: crisp sheets with just-right thread count, the weighted comfort of stacked pillows  
- Visual magic: curtains that dim the world perfectly, infrared light from vending machines
- Tiny rituals: unwrapping the cups, using the tiny shampoo bottles, watching the digital alarm clock blink  

Other examples:
- Parking lots after rain: Rainbow oil slicks, echoing footsteps, the buzzing halo of floodlights  
- 24-hour diners: Vinyl booth squeaks, coffee cup clinks, being a silent observer of the night shift world  

Cinematic Moments:

Weather as a sensory playground:
- Rain: Petrichor , the sound on different surfaces, clothing slowly becoming heavy  
- Snow: That sound of snow underfoot, how headlights make snowflakes look like falling stars, listening to the blues why wandering.

Others:
- Dancing wildly in grocery store aisles even as people look at me weird
- dancing in an empty parking garage
- Swinging on playgrounds at midnight

Cinematic human moments:
- The feeling of accidental eye contact with someone across the room (it can either feel like an intense thriller or some sort of rom com, but either way it’s electric)
- Eating takeout alone at night

I don't just notice these things, I vibrate with them. It's like:  
- My brain highlights sensory details in neon  
- certain spaces feel like safe, controlled stimulation  
- Scripted-feeling moments provide predictable joy  
- There's beauty in the ""wrong"" places others ignore

I have a Master’s degree, which I finished later than most of my peers because of financial difficulties and a major depressive episode. In my field, most people have PhDs and come from comfortable or wealthy background. I often feel like I’m surrounded by people who are more educated, more confident, and better connected than I am.

When I joined the company, I started as a junior in the same team as two colleagues — let’s call them “E” (male) and “S” (female). They’re both 2–5 years older than me, have PhDs, and are 1–2 grades higher in the hierarchy. We report to the same boss, but they have more responsibilities. Sometimes they would give me extra tasks on top of my workload to help with their projects. I never took it badly, I didn't find them rude, just very demanding, which I know is common in our sector. I saw them as high-level experts and considered it a chance to learn and build my portfolio.

Since starting, I’ve always done my job, but I constantly feel stressed and like I’m struggling to keep up. I often cut my lunch break short, skip coffee breaks, and only leave my desk to go to the bathroom. I feel like S and E, when they were in my position, managed everything better. I feel the same when I look at other juniors, younger than me, and from other  team. They spoke confidently, handled heavy workloads, and could pick up relevant points in meetings even if they weren’t directly related to their scope.

Me? I need extra time to organize my thoughts. I struggle to come up with smart points quickly in meetings. Even answering a simple email can take me ages because I rewrite it over and over and sometimes I still make mistakes or forget something important. To make it harder, our activities are often in English, German, or Mandarin and none of these are my native language.
The work is very company-specific, and I don’t fully understand everything. Somehow, I still manage to get my tasks done, but it takes me more time to  take notes, and organize my thoughts. Sometimes I succeed in a task and feel a boost of confidence then boom, another workload comes, and I’m back to struggling.



Recently, S announced she would take early retirement. My boss offered me her position, with a higher salary. I never even dreamed of being in S’s role, but I accepted.

Here’s the twist: I learned today that S and E had suggested not one, not two, but THREE other candidates to my boss before me. From my investigation they were unavailable due to visa or notice period issues. I was the fourth choice. I haven’t confronted my coworkers or my boss about it , it feels too shameful to bring this up. I had accepted before knowing this, thinking I could manage like I’ve somehow managed my current role. 
In meetings, if the topic isn’t directly in my scope, I tend to zone out — partly because following a long meeting in a non-native language takes so much effort to me. Maybe I don't have the""Mindeset"" or I am not smart enough to understand things easily. I’ve tried to be more attentive. But the more I learn, the more I feel like I know nothing. It’s the worst feeling.
I just feel  like my Master’s degree, which I struggled so much to earn, means nothing and helps me in no way with my career .



Since S retirement announcement,  S and E has been walking me through S tasks. E can be very cold when I don’t understand something immediately. Sometimes, when I ask a question, he just stares at me in silence, then says “absolutely not” or simply “no…” with a long pause before sighing and explaining.  After our meetings I’ve overheard him saying to others how tired he is, and I've never heard him complaints after any meeting.

Last week, we were in the office with S, going through some activities. It was S’s work, but since she had a lot to finish before leaving, E was the one training me. At one point, he tried to explain a calculation (normally done by our  statician  team) but wanted me to figure out the logic myself without telling me it's done by another team. My Master’s is related to statistics yet I just couldn’t follow.

It triggered an old childhood feeling — like when my dad wouldn’t let me leave the table until I finished my homework or recited my lessons, even if I was tired, late at night, or crying. I know I’m capable but at that moment, I felt a trapped in this room, like a child who questioned in front of the whole class by the teacher.

Eventually, I broke down crying. E looked away, clearly uncomfortable. S stopped typing. The room went silent except me sniffling (Just remembering it makes me want to cry again).
 E did become slightly less harsh after that, but the damage was done. I felt humiliated and so unprofessional.



I feel dumb because of the work, and now dumb for crying in front of my coworkers. But I’ve already signed the contract for this new role. If I back out, it could put the company in a bad position, I might even get fired and impact my reputation in the sector.

I’m terrified my boss will regret promoting me or that they will advocate against me to him, especially since I cried. I’m terrified I won’t be able to handle it.

1mq9wgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mq9wgu/my_bf_wants_us_to_commit_to_staying_in_his/,my bf wants us to commit to staying in his hometown,"a few years ago, i was working my dream job and met my dream guy.  my life literally felt perfect, and i told him that every day.  but his dad talked him into moving to his hometown, and he eventually talked me into it, by saying he’s going no matter what, and we could either be long distance or break up.  i decided to take a risk and move with him 

i love him and our relationship has been good otherwise.  but the move has been extremely rough.  the family house we are renting from his mom ended up being an infested hoarder house, and it took us a whole year to clean it out.  it still feels so dirty.  but the mortgage for this whole house is as cheap as renting an apartment otherwise, so it’s not a bad deal now that the house is in better shape 

but his small town is also super cliquey.  he’s popular since he used to be a football star here, and athletics are a big deal.  but i’m not, because i’m an outsider.  i got hired as a teacher, but was bullied for the whole year, without an option to break my contract.  it turned out my bfs dad was the instigator of the bullying, and he was awful to deal with too.  my bf did set boundaries with him and we no longer talk to him, and that’s a whole other long story.  since then, i’ve tried a couple jobs, but they both weren’t well paying and were also bad work environments.  i finally found a job with a positive work environment and okay pay, working part time as a manager at a coffee shop.  the job is still awkward because my bullies, a lot of teachers from the school i left (that’s the biggest workplace in this town), and my bfs dads friends frequent the coffee shop.  i haven’t been able to find a second part time job, so i currently am making enough to survive, but nothing more 

my bf knows that i am unhappy in this town.  he had said we could move back to the town where we met if i couldn’t find a good job.  at one point, i had emailed my old dream job to ask if they’d take me back.  they said they had unfortunately replaced me and weren’t currently hiring.  so returning is not an option.  i’ve been looking for a “safe” second job, while stressing about whether i want to keep living here, or where we’d even go if i moved.  i feel really lost about what to do with my life from here, and depressed about how difficult my life has been recently 

my bf loves his job he’s recently started at a bank.  i feel iffy about it because his coworkers were initially flirty with him, but they have stopped being that way recently, and he even started wearing a ring on his ring finger to get them to back off.  so some background is my bf has a lot of student debt from doing 3 years of university before, but he hadn’t finished his degree.  the debt stresses us both out.  his bank has a tuition reimbursement program, where they’d pay half the cost for him to get a 2 year associates degree.  with grants, he’d likely only end up having to pay a few hundred a semester.  but he doesn’t have any savings with which to pay that few hundred, so hed borrow the money from me, and i trust him to pay it back.  but the catch is he would have to promise to keep working at the bank the duration of the time it takes to get his degree and a year longer, probably about 3 years 

he told me about this idea of going to college yesterday, and that we’d have to live here for 3 years today.   i was not excited about it and the conversation devolved to me crying when he said that if i don’t want to stay here for 3 years, we could break up.  it reminded me of his original ultimatum that i either move with him or go long distance.  i told him that i think he should be finishing his bachelors degree, not starting an associates degree.  and i’m confused that he suddenly wants to major in finance out of nowhere, and classes would start on monday.  i wasn’t even sure if i want to live here, and he wants to commit to being here for another 3 years.  i told him that this impacts my life too, and living here has been difficult.  if he’s going to be in school on top of working full time, im not even going to have time with him anymore, and he’s my only friend here.  i just feel heart broken that he’s only thinking about himself again, and not willing to discuss or consider me or my input. and i feel like im lost through life now, when everything felt so perfect before.  we are going to discuss this more tonight, what can i say that might help us navigate this?

I had instant dread... By the time I was next at the till, the dogs proceeded to stand either side and partially in front of me, cornering me, they were looking at me with their mouths open... I take a quick glance down from the corner of my eye and my fight-or-flight kicks in. I instantly shudder and slink away to the side, not giving up my position in the queue but no longer standing directly in front of the till.

I didnt even look at her or give her any verbal response. I just shook my head and went red in the face.... Luckily a few moments later her male friend came into the coffee shop and he took the leads from her and brought them to heel, closer to him, the dogs then sat down either side of him.

I really want to say something! I should have said something. What should I have said? What can I say next time? I want to say something that is sharp to the point and puts the dog owners in their place. If not for my safety, but just so that these people hear some challenge to their behaviour.

That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on your grandma to survive a dance-off against a toddler—safe, but not exactly thrilling. **Universidad Católica**, the underdog, hovers around 4.1-4.4, implying a **21-23% chance**.

A 26-30% shot, which feels about right for a rivalry where neither team can agree on who’s better at being boring.

The totals line? A **2.5-goal threshold**, with “Under” priced at 1.7-1.82 (55-58% implied) and “Over” at 2.14-2.18 (46-47%). Translation: This game will either be a snoozefest or a sudden eruption of goals, like a geothermal hot tub in a library.

**Team News: Injuries, Comebacks, and One Goalkeeper’s Caffeine Crisis**  
Colo Colo’s star striker, **Javier “El Jefe” Morales**, is back from a hamstring injury sustained while tripping over his own shoelaces during a pre-game Instagram live. His return is like adding a defibrillator to a team’s offense—sudden, jolting, and occasionally painful for opponents. Meanwhile, Universidad Católica’s goalkeeper, **Lucas “The Human Espresso Machine” Rojas**, is allegedly battling a caffeine addiction, guzzling energy drinks to compensate for a recent viral video where he fell asleep mid-match.

My partner (30) and I (25) are from Texas born and raised, but lately have been itching for a change of scenery. A little about us: I work at a local coffee shop that’s busy 5/7 days in the week, and my boyfriend works at a popular brunch chain in our city. Places we frequent in the city are our local bookstore/library, craft stores, arcade/gaming stores, the occasional lake trip, the movies at least 2-3x a month, local vendor markets, and eating out at a local restaurant at least 2x/week. We live in a diverse part of our city, so having access to all kinds of food and markets is something of a necessity. Together we make about 5k a month and split everything easily, we have a 1br currently that we’re happy in but if it’s feasible greater square footage is obviously welcomed. We also have a dog who we enjoy walking around the few parks our city does have. Currently we’re involved with our community hands on weekly, and would love to continue this work as it means a lot to us. Our city has a little big town feel despite being at least top 10 largest cities in US. 
From what i’ve seen about the city, I really feel like this could be a great place for us to move. What are some things we should consider? Are there any pitfalls to making such a big move? What do you love and hate about the city? The big thing i’m worried about is the weather. I’ve never really been around a lot of snow, and tend to shrivel up in the texas “winter”.

My hometown. Known as ""The Brooklyn of Boston,” famous for coffee shops, bike lanes, diversity, a thriving arts scene, and being one of the most progressive cities in the country. Or so some of us thought...

Because now, some folks have decided that the current leader - a female immigrant who’s progressive and getting lots done - is somehow… too ‘status quo.’ Despite the city doing well (recently awarded a climate leader in MA, top transit city in the nation, and more) reading reddit comments about the city would make you think there’s no progress.

Here’s the thing. We all have short attention spans these days. Golly, I can barely make it through a TikTok without speeding it up. But people, now is certainly not the time to throw the baby out with the bath water! Who knows how the tariffs will affect bath water and lord knows no one can afford another baby right now.

As we all know the country, and world, is on fire - our rights being rolled backward, federal threats to sanctuary cities, neighbors being kidnapped, history being deleted. Terrifying to say the least. We have someone steering the ship who’s weathered the storm and legit made real progress: expanding affordable housing, climate action, small business support, improved transportation for goodness sake!!! And she’s done it while dodging political cannonballs due to her immigrant status.

I find it odd that some people are ready to hand the wheel to a dude with no real leadership experience. It’s really not the time to be reckless and give some guy a go at the helm here.

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Misery and Mastery**  
Let’s start with the numbers. Vitoria is the heavy favorite here, with decimal odds of **1.69–1.78** (implied probability: **55–58%**). That’s the statistical equivalent of a Swiss watch—precise, reliable, and unlikely to let you down. Juventude, meanwhile, is a staggering underdog at **5.0–5.5** (16–18% chance), which is about the same odds as betting your uncle will finally learn to text properly. The draw sits at **3.45–3.6** (27–29%), suggesting this isn’t a total rout… unless someone trips over the “rout” metaphor and scores accidentally.

Total goals? The under **2.25–2.5** line is favored, with **1.65–1.89** odds (54–60% implied). Translation: Buckle up for a defensive snoozefest. Expect fewer goals than the number of times your local coffee shop runs out of oat milk.

**Team News: Injuries, Anecdotes, and Existential Crises**  
*Vitoria*: Their star striker, **Lucas Torreira** (or is it *Lucas Watchira*? We’ll get to that), is fit and firing, having scored 5 goals in his last 3 matches. Their defense? A fortress guarded by **Éder Militão**, who’s so good at clearing crosses, he once accidentally launched a bird into orbit. No injuries to report—unless you count their midfield’s “chronic overachieving.”

*Juventude*: Tragedy strikes! Their **all-star forward, Erik**, is out with a hamstring injury sustained while *practicing yoga on a trampoline*. Their backup striker, **Welliton**, is… well, *not a ton*. Defensively, they’re about as leaky as a sieve left in a monsoon.

Or instead, a breakfast sandwich, 2 donuts, and a large ice coffee. Terrible but not the end of the world. I would do this like once every other week. Sometimes once per week if I'm just really really bored.

She complains all the time about how much she does for me and the family, and how her life is so much harder than mine. But hearing that she views me, her husband, as just someone else to take care of really makes me feel like a dependent in he rlife instead of her husband.  I though we were in this together and that my contributions were meaningful, but it appears not. Now I'm starting to do my own laundry and plan to take care fo any other needs I have just so she can't say she's taking care of me anymore.

Our four kids are ages 9 to 22, so there's no babies or dieapers to deal with anymore.  She does home-school which I genuinely appreciate and have offered to take on recently after all her complaining, but she turned that down saying I wouldnt' be good at it. She manages the house and the kids which is not an easy task.  I'm not trying to minimize her effort or vilify her, she is a hard worker and it takes a lot to manage the household and kids.  I work to provide everything our family needs, and she can purchase anything she wants (within reason) without worrying about money. But I'm just really insulted by being lumped in with the children as someone she has to ""take care of"".

Growing up in an immigrant family, I was often told I was worthless, part of my dad's strategy to ingrain a work ethic in us kids, I guess kind of like whipping the horse to make it run harder.  His plan to ingrain a strong work ethic succeeded, but left me struggling with a very low sense of self worth even as a 46yo adult, always doing way more than anyone asked to seek others' approval.  That's my problem to deal with and not her fault, but I guess I thought I was worth more in her eyes, and when she said that it made me realize she sees me as a burden in her life.

As for my contributions, I work a FT job in tech and also run my own well-established (20+ years) tech business on the side, bringing in an income enough to support our family.  I handle all the book keeping, accounting and taxes with our CPA. She hasn't had to work in about 16 years. When she says that going to work is easier than being home, I offered to completely rearrange our lives to support her working or even quit and take over the home responsibilities myself. I have encouraged her to find something she loves to do and said I'd fully support her, but she's never taken me up on it.

I wake up at 5:00 and go to bed at 10pm. She sleeps in so I make my own breakfast, eat along, and clean up after myself washing all my dishes and hand drying them immediately (because she doesn't like anything left in the drying rack), and do my best to leave the kitchen spotless. I also prepare my own lunch and clean everything I use.

Then from 6:00 t0 8:00 in the morning I volunteer at a friend's hobby farm to learn sustainable food production for our family. Then I work 8-10 hours for my normal job and antoher 2-3 hours for my business.  I do about 30% of the kid pickups and drop offs, and half of the grocery shopping even though I've offered to do all of it if she'd give me a complete meal plan or list which rarely happens.  I've tried sitting down with her to make the meal plans together, but that seems to aggravate her, and when I""ve made the meal plans she always nitpicks at it and tears me down for the most minor things.  Oh and she doesn't ""like"" going to Costco so I also do all the Costco shopping alone every other week.

I'm present at family dinners, even though I don't typically eat at night.  I cook dinner 3-4 times per week, and have agreed to completely take over dinner so she doesn't have to do it.  I enjoy cooking, even though I'm not very experience, my kids really like my rice, pasta, and meat dishes better they've said.  But doing it consistently has been hard with the rest of my workload, though I'll keep pushing forward to completely unburden her from having to cook dinner.

I manage our investments, research tax strategies, and retirement planning, completely alone, because she says she doesn't have time to learn with me.

I'm also in teh process of starting up another LLC for a new business venture, in the hopes of eventually having multiple revenue streams for our family and retirement. I am also researching trusts, and plan to eventually open a trust with my kids as beneficiaries, teaching them to manage the businesses as they get older and building generational wealth in a trust that provides for my kids and grand kids long after I'm gone.

I've been developing a rural property that we own which is 1.5 hours away from where we live. For the past two years that meant cleaning up the trash there, mowing, removing junk structures, etc.  Right now it means talking to contractors, planning to build a tiny home for family use, putting up deer fencing, and caring for 120+ potted plants I've been growing at the farm to eventually plant there for a food forest.

I also maintain our three vehicles, coordinate repairs, mow the lawn, and have fixed our freezer and dishwasher recently (though I needed help on the washing machine). I built shelving in the garage for storage, and now I'm organizing a full remodel of our master bathroom because she told me she's depressed and really needs a bathtub again for her stress.

Recently I've been having to deal with own health issues: I was recently diagnosed with insulin resistance (pre-diabetic) and am working hard to reverse it through research, better eating habits, and intermittent fasting. That's the main reason I don't eat dinner now, since I can't afford to break down because my family depends on me.

Despite all this, I'm constantly told I only ""work"" while she does ""everything else,"" and that I'm lucky to have a wife who keeps a clean house (which is her obsession not mine). I know she's burnt out. We go to weekly therapy and I try to be supportive, but it feels like no matter what I do, I'm the villain.

I have offered to take on more, and I've offered to completely switch roles to make her happy.  I tried to be present and supportive, and she has told me I'm a good provider from time to time, but most of the time the point she is driving home is how lucky I am to have her, and how most men would love to have a wife like her. I can't help but think that maybe other women would love to have a husband like me too.  But being told I'm like a child she has to take care of has left me feeling disrespected and undervalued.

AITAH for being hurt and deciding to stop depending on her for anything at all?

**UPDATE**: I feel I should add a bit more context here. I value everything she does, home schooling is work.  Coordinating the kids activities is work. I tell her that I value what she does, and help out any way that I can.  I care deeply about my relationship with my wife and each of our children.  I spend time with each of our kids daily, I enjoy helping to drive them around to their activities, coaching their sports teams, and take them out of the house to do something fun 2-3 times per week so my wife can have a break.  I work from home 100% of the time, even before Covid was a thing.  I only leave early in the morning and get back home to shower before anyone is typically awake.  We go on family outings on the weekends as well.  I cook dinner for the family 4 times per week, soon to be every day as she agreed to let me take that on.  I offer to cook breakfast 3 times a week, but my wife drinks coffee and skips breaksfast, so she only lets me make her breakfast about once a week, and the other kids are old enough they say they want to make their own breakfast.  The only reason I listed what I do wasn't to say I do more, as the question isn't ""who does more"".  It was simply to ask if what I do is enough to not be considered a burden on the family.  That's it.  I was called a burden on her life, so if I ask someone else whether I""m a burden or not, they are going to ask me how I contribute to her life, so I listed some of the ways I contribute, that's all.  No need to say I don't value what she does, unless you honestly expect a reddit post to accurately depict the vast amount of things each of us does day to day, which would be very long and boring.   I'm not trying to toot my own horn, as you'll see from my history I haven't posted to reddit in years.  Homeschooling is tough, I know it.  Before she started homeschooling our kids were in private school because she didn't watn them in public school.  She chose to homeschool them, and over the years I have contributed, and even offered to take over home schooling but she said she knows  how busy I am and also doesn't think I'd do as good a job as her, so she has decided to continue home schooling. I don't force her to do anything, at all.  As for laundry, yes she does it. I've tried to take that on a few times but she was annoyed that I didn't already know her way of doing it, and said she doesn't mind doing laundry and insisted on doing it herself.",0,1755197555.0,AITAH,101,0.33,False

# Best Wood Reclaimed Coffee Table [2025]: Top Picks

Reclaimed wood coffee tables are more than just functional furniture; they are statements of sustainability and unique style. Each piece tells a story, bearing teh marks of its past life, whether it's from an old barn, a demolished building, or salvaged timber. In 2025,the demand for eco-friendly and characterful home décor continues to grow,making reclaimed wood coffee tables a popular choice for homeowners looking to add warmth,texture,and a touch of history to their living spaces. This guide explores the top reclaimed wood coffee tables available,highlighting their features,benefits,and ideal user profiles. These aren't just tables; they're conversation starters and eco-conscious choices.

## key Features Analysis

The best reclaimed wood coffee tables share several key features that contribute to their overall appeal and functionality. these might include the source and type of wood, the craftsmanship involved in its construction, the style and design elements, the table's dimensions and weight capacity, and any additional features such as storage or adjustable height.

**Wood Source and Type:**

the origin and kind of wood used considerably impact the coffee table's look and durability. Many reclaimed wood coffee tables are crafted from timbers salvaged from old barns, factories, or warehouses. These materials often include hardwoods like oak,maple,and pine,known for their sturdiness and distinctive grain patterns. The source contributes to the piece's history and adds a unique character to each table. A coffee table made from century-old barn wood,for example,will have a vastly different aesthetic than one sourced from reclaimed shipping pallets. The type of wood will also determine durability and resistance to wear and tear.

**Construction and Craftsmanship:**

The quality of construction and craftsmanship is paramount for the longevity and stability of a reclaimed wood coffee table. Look for tables that feature solid wood construction with sturdy joinery techniques like mortise and tenon or dovetail joints.Metal accents, such as iron legs or framing, can add to the table's structural integrity and enhance its rustic appeal. A well-crafted table will be able to withstand daily use and maintain its beauty for years to come. Check for smooth finishes, even surfaces, and secure attachments to ensure the table is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

**Design and style:**

Reclaimed wood coffee tables come in a diverse range of designs and styles, from rustic and farmhouse to industrial and modern. Consider the overall aesthetic of your living space when choosing a table. A rustic table might feature raw edges, visible knots, and a distressed finish, while an industrial table might incorporate metal legs and a sleek, minimalist design. Some tables may even blend different styles,creating a unique and eclectic look.The design should complement your existing furniture and décor while also making a statement as a focal point in the room.

**Dimensions and Weight Capacity:**

Pay close attention to the dimensions and weight capacity of the coffee table to ensure it fits comfortably in your living space and meets your functional needs. Measure the area where you plan to place the table and consider the size of your sofa and other furniture. The table should be proportional to the surrounding elements and provide ample surface area for drinks, books, and other items. Also, check the weight capacity to ensure the table can support the items you typically place on it. A larger, heavier table might potentially be more stable and durable but also more difficult to move.

Key features of the best reclaimed wood coffee tables include:

   Unique and characterful wood with a story
   Durable and sturdy construction
   Variety of styles to match any décor
   Appropriate size and weight capacity for different living spaces

## Core Benefits

Reclaimed wood coffee tables offer several practical benefits beyond their aesthetic appeal. These advantages range from enhanced durability and environmental friendliness to increased functionality and style versatility. Choosing a reclaimed wood coffee table provides both immediate enjoyment and long-term value.

**Enhanced Durability and Longevity:**

Reclaimed wood is often denser and more durable than new wood due to its age and the natural seasoning process it has undergone over time. This makes reclaimed wood coffee tables exceptionally resistant to wear and tear, ensuring they withstand daily use and maintain their beauty for years to come. The inherent strength of the wood minimizes the risk of warping, cracking, or splintering, making it a wise investment.

**environmental Sustainability:**

By choosing a reclaimed wood coffee table, you are contributing to environmental sustainability by repurposing materials that would or else end up in landfills. Reclaimed wood reduces the demand for newly harvested timber, helping to conserve forests and protect ecosystems. This eco-friendly choice aligns with a growing consumer preference for sustainable and environmentally conscious products.

1mq9hhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mq9hhp/how_does_the_ninja_dualbrew_coffee_maker_perform/,How Does the Ninja DualBrew Coffee Maker Perform with Pods and Grounds?,"Testing out the Ninja CFP100 Series DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker for the past few weeks has been quite the caffeinated adventure. For someone who’s all about flexibility in their morning brew—whether that’s a frothy hot cup or a crisp iced coffee—it’s a highly versatile machine. Right out of the box, it felt like the brand put serious thought into ensuring this coffee maker could serve a wide variety of tastes and purposes. The device was straightforward to set up and came with helpful additions like the 12-cup glass carafe and paper filter kit, making it functional from the get-go.

**Ease of Use and Programming**  
One thing that immediately stood out was how easy it was to program this coffee maker. The fully automatic operation mode and intuitive button-based interface made experimental brews feel more like a fun challenge than a hassle. With its programmable brewing feature, mornings became much smoother since I could schedule my coffee to be ready before I even stepped into the kitchen. Sometimes, even the simplest things like adjusting the warming plate for up to four hours can make a world of difference in a busy day.

**Good Aspects**  
- Offers both single-serve and carafe options for brewing flexibility  
- Highly convenient removable 60-ounce water reservoir  
- Includes custom brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice  
- The built-in warming plate is a lifesaver for keeping coffee warm longer

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
I am the kind of person who needs variety, and this coffee maker delivered on that. With nine grounds brewing sizes—from a small cup to a full carafe—and four pod brewing sizes, it’s hard to get bored of the combinations. The machine also features a Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo that ensures balanced saturation and precise temperature control, consistently giving flavorful results. One of my absolute favorites was the Over Ice brew option; it managed to create iced coffee that wasn’t watered down—a minor miracle for someone picky about iced drinks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker is sleek yet practical, with its black aesthetic fitting perfectly into a modern kitchen design. The foldable single-serve platform is another nifty addition. It elevates your cup just enough to prevent splash disasters, which I appreciated during groggy mornings. However, at 8.8 pounds, it’s not exactly lightweight, making it slightly less portable if counter space is limited in your kitchen. 

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly bulky design, requiring adequate counter space  
- Paper filters mean recurring purchases, which might annoy users preferring metal mesh filters  

**Other Options**  
When considering alternatives, the Keurig K-Duo stands out as a direct competitor. While Keurig’s single-serve machines have their charm with an easy pod-based design, they often lack the brew temperature precision and flavor control provided by the Ninja coffee maker. Hamilton Beach models, known for their affordability, generally pale in comparison due to fewer brewing options and less durability over time. What sets the Ninja apart is its “dual-purpose” capability with pods and grounds in one machine, something many others struggle to nail.

**Smart Spending**  
Discussing the price of this coffee maker in context, it strikes a decent balance between both affordability and high-end features. There are models out there that cost significantly more but don’t offer the same functionality, like iced coffee brewing or multiple brewing sizes. In my opinion, it earns its spot as a budget-friendly choice for coffee enthusiasts who want a range of features without feeling like they’re shelling out for niche gadgets.

1mq9err,https://i.redd.it/vww4ko1h61jf1.jpeg,Link? Title is Disbanded,"Grace's world changed dramatically when her half-sister Lola, whom she had never met, found her. Grace was told that her father was the president of a motorcycle club and she had two biker brothers.

""So... my- our dad? His name's King. It's not a nickname. It's a road name.""
Grace frowned. ""A what?""
""He's the president of a motorcycle club. Like, a real one.""
Grace blinked. ""Like He-ll's Angels? You're telling me I just walked into a town full of bikers?""
Grace raised an eyebrow.
""Are you in it? The club?""
Lola shook her head. ""No. Girls don't patch in. But Harley and Ryder are members. Your brothers. Full patched.""
Grace stared out at the men she was about to meet.
Her brothers. And the world they belonged to.
Lola stepped forward, chin high. ""She's our sister.""
""Yeah, we know,"" Ryder said coolly. ""You made sure of that when you dumped her DNA results on us like a bomb.""
""She's a stranger,"" Harley cut in. ""You don't just bring someone like that here without telling us.""
""She's nothing to me,"" Harley said, and then his eyes landed on Grace.
Grace didn't say anything. She just stood there, eyes wide and unblinking, every muscle locked in place.
She should've expected this. She did expect this.
But it still hurt.
___________

The bus hissed as it pulled away, leaving behind the sting of diesel and a knot of nerves sitting heavy in Grace's stomach.
She stood on the cracked sidewalk with her duffel bag slung over one shoulder, hoodie sleeves pulled down over her hands despite the late spring warmth. The town was smaller than she expected - quieter too. No towering buildings to swallow her, no strangers bustling past. Just faded shopfronts, a handful of cars, and the sound of wind tugging at the flag outside the diner across the street.
This was it.
She shifted her weight, eyes scanning for a face she'd only seen in photos. Lola had said she'd pick her up - offered, insisted, really - but now Grace wasn't so sure this wasn't a mistake.
It wasn't too late. She could turn around, walk back to the bus stop, keep going. She'd done it before - picked up and disappeared. It was safer that way.
But she didn't move.
Instead, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. One unread message glowed on the lock screen.
Lola: Be there in five!! Can't wait to meet you xx
Grace read it again, then locked the screen and slid the phone back. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her bag.
She wasn't good at this - meeting people. Letting them in. Letting them see her. But something about Lola's messages, her messy spelling, her overuse of emojis, had chipped away at Grace's hesitation over the last few weeks.
It wasn't just curiosity. It was... hope. Small, dangerous, stupid hope.
A battered black SUV rounded the corner a minute later, music thumping faintly from the rolled-down windows. Grace straightened as it slowed in front of her and stopped. The engine cut out.
The driver's door flew open.
""Oh my god - GRACE?!""
The voice matched the face - blonde hair hacked into a choppy bob, eyes big and gray, a smile that nearly knocked Grace off balance.
Lola launched across the pavement without hesitation, arms flung wide like she'd been waiting her whole life for this moment.
Grace froze - just for a second - before Lola crashed into her, arms wrapping tight around her shoulders.
""You're real,"" Lola breathed. ""I knew you'd come. God, you're even smaller than I thought you'd be.""
Grace let the hug happen, awkward and unsure. She hadn't been hugged in a long time. Not like this. Not by someone who meant it.
""I- Yeah. Hi,"" she said softly, her voice rough from the long ride.
Lola pulled back, grinning. ""I'm so freaking happy you're here. You hungry? The guys don't get back until later.""
The guys.
Grace's chest tightened, but she didn't show it. She just nodded.
""Sure. Food sounds good.""
She followed Lola to the SUV, sliding into the passenger seat, her heartbeat louder than the music crackling through the speakers. As the town rolled past the window, she felt it again - that low, tugging ache in her chest.
She didn't know what she was walking into.
But for the first time in a long time, she was walking toward something instead of away.
The inside of the SUV smelled like coconut air freshener, fast food wrappers, and something vaguely floral. Lola drove like she talked - fast, animated, and without a filter.
""So, like, I didn't tell the guys you were coming yet,"" she said, one hand on the wheel, the other waving for emphasis. ""I was going to, but then I thought - screw it. You deserve a warm welcome, not whatever cold nonsense they'd dish out.""
Grace glanced over. ""So... they don't know about me?""
""Oh no, they know. They were there when I told Dad about the DNA match. But they don't know you're here. Today."" She winced. ""They've been... kind of dicks about it.""
Grace didn't answer. She just looked out the window as the town blurred past - low houses, dusty roads, power lines stretching overhead like lazy spiderwebs. She wasn't surprised. People like her didn't get welcomed with open arms.
Lola must've picked up on the silence because she cleared her throat and added quickly, ""But that's their problem. Not yours.""
Grace nodded, but said nothing.
The diner was a squat white building with peeling red trim and a neon sign that buzzed faintly in the early evening air. Inside, it smelled like bacon grease, sugar syrup, and old vinyl. Grace slid into the booth across from Lola, her bag tucked in beside her like a shield.
Lola ordered pancakes and fries. Grace hesitated, then went with the same.
""You okay with this?"" Lola asked after the waitress walked away. ""Us, I mean. Me kind of ambushing your life.""
Grace folded a sugar packet between her fingers. ""You didn't ambush me.""
""You came all the way here,"" Lola said, grinning. ""I mean - you came. That has to mean something.""
Grace gave a small shrug. ""I didn't have much keeping me anywhere else.""
Lola's grin faltered for half a second - a flash of empathy in her eyes - but she didn't press.
Instead, she leaned forward on her elbows, chin in her hands. ""So tell me stuff. Like, what do you do? What's your favorite color? Do you like cats? You look like a cat person.""
Grace blinked. ""You... want me to start with a color?""
Lola shrugged, still smiling. ""I don't know. I just want to know you.""
Grace hesitated. Then: ""Gray. The kind before a storm.""
""Of course it is."" Lola beamed like she'd expected that exact answer. ""Mine's yellow. Like lemons. Or sunflowers. Or that ugly couch at Dad's house, but don't tell him I said that.""
Grace found herself smiling - just barely, but it was there. She looked down at the table. ""I never really thought about it before.""
Lola reached across and stole one of the sugar packets she'd been folding. ""Well, you're going to. I've got a million questions. And I'm warning you - I talk a lot. I basically narrate my own life.""
The food arrived, and they both dug in. Grace hadn't realized how hungry she was until the first bite. She ate fast, quietly, while Lola talked - about the town, the diner, the time she and Ryder got into a shouting match over who finished the last Pop-Tart, about how Harley once broke his hand punching a tree during a fight with an ex.
""They're good guys,"" Lola said after a while, tone softer. ""They've just got... layers. Like onions.""
Grace didn't respond. She focused on cutting a pancake into smaller pieces, even though she was already full.
""You don't have to like them,"" Lola added. ""Just don't let them push you out, okay? You deserve to be here too.""
Grace's throat felt tight. She reached for her water instead of answering.
The shadows outside had stretched longer by the time they finished. The air had that heavy, quiet weight that came before something changed. Grace could feel it. Something was coming. She just didn't know if it was going to hurt or heal.
Maybe both.
The last of the fries sat in a messy pile between them, cold and half-eaten. Grace leaned back in the booth, her stomach full for the first time in... she couldn't remember. Lola was stirring the remains of her milkshake with a straw, watching her like she was trying to memorize her face.
Grace didn't know what to do with that.
""So..."" Lola started, voice lighter now, too casual to be real. ""There's something I should probably tell you.""
Grace stilled, the glass of water halfway to her mouth. ""Okay.""
""It's not bad,"" Lola said quickly. ""Just... important.""
Grace set the glass down. ""Alright.""
Lola blew out a breath. ""So... my- our dad? His name's King. It's not a nickname. It's a road name.""
Grace frowned. ""A what?""
""He's the president of a motorcycle club. Like, a real one.""
Grace blinked. ""Like He-ll's Angels?""
Lola winced. ""Sort of. Not that exact one, but yeah, that kind of club.""
Silence bloomed between them.
Grace leaned back slowly. ""You're telling me I just walked into a town full of bikers?""
""Not the whole town,"" Lola said quickly. ""Just... a part of it.""
Grace raised an eyebrow.
Lola winced again. ""Okay, a big part. But it's not like what you're thinking. They're not- I mean, yeah, they've got rules and structure and all that stuff, but it's not like Sons of Anarchy or whatever.""
""Right."" Grace's voice was flat. ""Just leather and loyalty and probably some guns.""
Lola pointed a fry at her. ""Wow. Nailed it in three.""
Grace didn't laugh.
""You okay?"" Lola asked, softer now. ""You're really quiet.""
Grace stared at the table. ""I just didn't know I was walking into all that.""
""I wanted to tell you sooner, I did,"" Lola said, folding her hands in front of her. ""But I didn't want it to scare you off.""
""It might've.""
""But you're here,"" Lola said, voice gentle but steady. ""And you're stronger than anyone I know.""
Grace's jaw tightened. She hated compliments. They always felt like lies wrapped in kindness. And Lola didn't know her.
""You should've told me,"" she said quietly.
""I know,"" Lola said, her voice small.
Grace didn't speak for a long moment. Then she leaned forward, elbows on the table, her storm-gray eyes locking with Lola's.
""Are you in it? The club?""
Lola shook her head. ""No. Girls don't patch in. But Harley and Ryder are members. Full patched.""
Grace absorbed that, filing the names away. ""And they don't know I'm coming.""
""They know you exist,"" Lola corrected. ""But I figured I'd ease them into the whole you're-here-now-deal-with-it thing.""
Grace nodded slowly. ""And this dad of ours? King?""
""In prison,"" Lola said, wincing again. ""But only for now.""
Grace blinked.
Lola laughed nervously. ""Yeah, so... welcome to the family?""
Grace let out a slow breath and leaned back again, eyes fixed on the ceiling like it might offer a map out.
She didn't run. She didn't get up or walk away. But she felt something click inside her - a quiet bracing, the way you do when you feel a storm rolling in.
Because she knew storms.
And apparently, she'd just walked into the middle of one.
Grace didn't say anything for a long time.
Lola didn't push.
The waitress dropped the bill with a too-bright smile, and Lola snatched it before Grace could move, waving her off with a ""you're my guest"" and an even brighter grin that didn't quite reach her eyes this time.
Outside, the air was cooling, the sky a faded lavender bruised with streaks of orange. The kind of dusky calm that only came before everything changed.
They stood by the SUV in silence.
Grace finally spoke. ""You said they'd be home soon.""
Lola looked up, cautious. ""Yeah.""
""If I'm going to do this,"" Grace said, ""I want to do it now.""
Lola blinked. ""Now?""
Grace nodded. Her hands were in the pocket of her hoodie, fists clenched so tightly her knuckles ached. ""Before I talk myself out of it.""
Lola looked like she was going to argue - or maybe protect her - but something in Grace's expression stopped her.
""Okay,"" she said softly. ""Let's go.""
The ride was quieter this time. The music was low. Lola tapped the steering wheel, a nervous rhythm filling the space between them.
""You don't have to say much,"" Lola offered after a few minutes. ""Just meeting you will be enough.""
Grace watched the road, jaw tight. ""What if it's not?""
""They'll come around.""
""You sure?""
""No."" Lola gave a crooked smile. ""But I'm stubborn.""
Grace almost smiled at that. Almost.
They turned off the main road and followed a narrow, winding one that seemed to slip between trees and fields, getting rougher the farther they went. Crickets had begun to chirp. A dog barked somewhere in the distance. There were no streetlights out here. No people. Just the hum of the engine and the thump of Grace's heartbeat in her ears.
And then, through the trees, the clubhouse came into view.
It was larger than she expected - low and long, built of dark brick and metal siding, with a wide gravel lot out front and a huge steel gate that stood open. A few bikes were parked in a row like wolves at rest, chrome catching the last of the sun. A fire pit glowed in the distance. Laughter carried faintly across the yard, sharp and male and too familiar in the worst way.
Grace's stomach twisted.
As they pulled in, headlights sweeping over the yard, she felt her body react - old instincts tightening her chest, bracing for what could go wrong.
But she didn't flinch. She didn't ask Lola to turn around. She sat up straighter.
She'd faced worse than a few angry brothers.
Still, her voice was quiet when she finally spoke.
""This is your life?""
Lola glanced at her, smile cautious. ""Yeah. For better or worse.""
The SUV rolled to a stop just inside the gate. The laughter had gone quiet.
And Grace, with the last of the sun painting her face in gold and shadow, stared out at the men she was about to meet.
Her brothers.
And the world they belonged to.

The SUV had barely come to a stop when the clubhouse door banged open.
Two men stepped out.
Both tall, broad, and unmistakably cut from the same cloth - not just by the patches on their black leather vests, but by the way they moved. Like they owned the ground they walked on. Like they knew everyone was watching.
Lola killed the engine. ""Just... let me talk first, okay?""
Grace nodded numbly, though her throat was already closing.
The passenger door creaked as she climbed out. The gravel shifted beneath her boots. The air smelled like smoke and oil and something darker - something edged.
Harley reached them first. Blonde, bearded, eyes a shade of gray that didn't look anything like Lola's right now. His were cold. Sharp.
Ryder was a half-step behind, leaner, quieter, but somehow more intimidating for it. His eyes flicked over Grace like he was scanning a threat.
""What the heck, Lola?"" Harley snapped, arms out. ""You serious with this?""
Lola stepped forward, chin high. ""She's our sister.""
""Yeah, we know,"" Ryder said coolly. ""You made sure of that when you dumped her DNA results on us like a bomb.""
""She deserves to meet us,"" Lola said, voice steady. ""To know who she is.""
""She's a stranger,"" Harley cut in. ""You don't just bring someone like that here without telling us.""
""She's not 'someone like that,' she's-""
""She's nothing to me,"" Harley said, and then his eyes landed on Grace.
That stupid, aching hope that had followed her since the diner - since the moment Lola had hugged her like she meant it - snapped like a thread pulled too tight.
Grace didn't say anything. She just stood there, eyes wide and unblinking, every muscle locked in place.
She should've expected this. She did expect this.
But it still hurt.
Harley's expression didn't soften. ""What, you think just because you share some blood with us, that means you get a seat at the table?""
Grace didn't answer. Couldn't. Her tongue felt glued to the roof of her mouth. Her hands were in the pockets of her hoodie, fists clenched so tight her nails bit into her skin.
Ryder spoke next, his voice quieter but no less cutting. ""You got a last name?""
Grace blinked. ""I-"" Her voice caught. She cleared it, barely above a whisper. ""No. I mean- I've had a few.""
Something flickered in Ryder's eyes - not sympathy, not even curiosity. Just calculation. Like he was slotting that answer into a box he already had ready.
Lola looked between them, furious. ""She didn't come here to beg. She came here to meet you. To know where she came from. If you don't want that, fine - but don't act like she's the intruder when she's just trying to belong somewhere.""
Harley's jaw tightened. ""She's not my problem.""
""She's King's,"" Ryder said.
Grace flinched like she'd been slapped.
Harley turned, already done. ""This is nonsense.""
Ryder didn't move right away. His gaze stayed on Grace, unreadable. Then he finally shook his head and followed Harley back inside, the door slamming behind them.
The silence that followed felt like it pressed down on her skin.
Grace didn't move.
Lola turned to her slowly. ""Grace-""
""I'm fine.""
""You're not-""
""I said I'm fine.""
She wasn't. She was frozen - not from shock, but from the slow, bitter confirmation that this was what happened when she hoped.
""I'm so sorry, I should have warned them. I didn't think they'd-"" Lola broke off. ""I was trying to protect you.""
Grace nodded, because she didn't trust herself to speak again.
She wasn't crying. She never cried in front of people.
But her throat burned.
And that little flame of hope - the one she never should've let catch - flickered and died.
The sky had darkened by the time they pulled away from the clubhouse. Neither of them said much.
Grace sat pressed back into the passenger seat, eyes locked on the road ahead, but seeing none of it. Her hands were clasped in her lap, still and small. Lola kept glancing over, her mouth opening and closing more than once.
She didn't try again until they reached the house.
It was tucked between two larger homes on a sleepy street - small, cozy, and painted a soft lemon yellow with overflowing window boxes. A string of solar lights blinked faintly along the fence. It looked like the kind of place someone chose to live in - full of color and softness and deliberate comfort.
Grace stared at it from the sidewalk.
""It's not much,"" Lola said, cutting the engine. ""But it's mine.""
Grace nodded, still silent.
Lola unlocked the front door and pushed it open, flicking on a warm lamp just inside. The living room was small but bursting with life - mismatched cushions on a faded blue couch, a bookshelf spilling over, candles everywhere, and half a knitted blanket lying across a basket.
""Home sweet chaos,"" Lola murmured.
Grace hovered in the doorway, unsure whether to take off her shoes or stay ready to bolt.
Lola toed hers off and padded in. ""Come on. I'll show you the spare room.""
She led her up the stairs and down a short hallway, opening a door that looked over the back of the house.
It was small, but it had clearly been made up with care - soft white bedding, a couple of fairy lights along the wall, a secondhand dresser painted mint green, and a folded towel waiting at the end of the bed. A candle sat unlit on the windowsill. It smelled like vanilla and something warm.
Grace stepped inside slowly. It was too nice. Too gentle. The kind of space you gave to someone who mattered.
She didn't know what to do with that.
""You can stay as long as you want,"" Lola said quietly from behind her. ""I mean that.""
Grace nodded once, eyes on the bed.
""I'll let you settle in,"" Lola added, backing away. ""Bathroom's across the hall. I'm gonna make tea. If you want one.""
""Okay,"" Grace said, voice thin.
When the door clicked shut, she sat down slowly on the edge of the bed. The mattress dipped softly beneath her. She ran her hands over the blanket, her palms brushing the stitching.
It was too quiet.
Her chest still ached in that familiar, hollow way. The kind of ache she didn't let anyone see.
She leaned down and unlaced her boots slowly, toeing them off and setting them neatly side by side. Then she tucked her legs beneath her and pulled the blanket over her lap, sitting upright like a guest in someone else's dream.
The room was warm. Safe. Still.
But she felt like a ghost in it.
Out of place. Too loud, even in silence. Like a crack on glass - the kind you only noticed after the light caught it just right.
She didn't cry. Of course she didn't. She just sat there, hands clasped, eyes fixed on the window, trying not to remember the look in Harley's eyes when he'd said she was nothing to him.
The silence pressed in.
Grace sat there for a long time - unmoving, unsure, her eyes flicking over every corner of the room like she was waiting for something to shift. For the catch. The change. The moment when the warmth turned cold and the welcome ran out.
She'd seen it before. Too many times to count.
Her duffel sat unopened by the dresser. She didn't unpack.
Instead, she stood, slow and stiff, and wandered across the room. Her fingers brushed the edge of the candle on the sill. She pressed the pad of her thumb to the glass, then the plaster wall, then the bedframe. A habit. Subtle. Tactile. Like touching things could make them real. Or give her warning.
She cracked the door open and padded barefoot down the hall, quiet as a whisper.
Lola was in the kitchen, humming under her breath as she poured water into mismatched mugs. She looked up when she heard Grace, offering a small, hopeful smile.
""Mint or chamomile?""
Grace hesitated. ""Whichever.""
Lola handed her a mug of chamomile. No questions. No pity. Just quiet warmth in a chipped white cup.
They sat on the couch in near silence, the television played something soft in the background - a nature documentary with the volume turned low. The voice of a British narrator drifted over the gentle clink of their spoons.
Grace blew on her tea. ""You decorated all this?""
Lola looked around, smile tugging at her mouth. ""Yeah. Bit by bit. Secondhand shops and rescue plants and leftover paint.""
""It's nice.""
""Thanks. I wanted it to feel like... me, I guess.""
Grace nodded slowly. She traced her thumb over the rim of the mug. ""Feels like someone lives here.""
Lola tilted her head. ""You've never had that before?""
Grace didn't answer right away. Then she said quietly, ""I've had rooms. Beds. Rules. Not places.""
Lola didn't speak. Just sipped her tea and let the words hang there.
A beat passed. Two.
Then Lola said, voice soft and almost shy, ""You can make it yours too, you know. That room. If you want.""
Grace didn't look at her. ""I don't know how.""
""That's okay,"" Lola said gently. ""We've got time.""
Grace nodded, but her throat felt thick again. Her tea sat cooling in her hands.
They watched TV in silence after that. Grace didn't say much. Didn't smile. But her shoulders dropped by a millimetre each passing minute.
And when Lola said goodnight and left the hallway light on without asking, Grace didn't turn it off.
She lay in the bed later, staring at the ceiling, her hoodie still on and the blanket only pulled halfway over her.
She didn't sleep easily.
She never did.
But sometime after midnight, the house settled around her. The quiet was gentle. Not dangerous. And for the first time in a long time, she let her eyes close in a room that didn't belong to strangers.
She wasn't safe.
Not really.
But she wasn't running either.
And that was something.

The smell woke her.
Warm, savory, comforting - something frying in butter, something sweet beneath it. Grace blinked against the soft light spilling through the curtains. For a moment, she didn't move.
She forgot where she was.
Then she sat up too quickly, heart skipping before the details of the night before came rushing back: the diner, the brothers, the silence.
Lola.
Grace rubbed her face with both hands and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. The room still looked untouched - she hadn't unpacked, hadn't even moved the towel. Her boots were exactly where she'd left them, lined up like she was still waiting for someone to tell her to leave.
She tugged her hoodie over her tank top, finding it on the floor where she'd thrown it in the middle of the night, and padded barefoot to the kitchen.
Lola was already there, dancing slightly as she flipped pancakes in a pan, wearing plaid sleep shorts and a faded tank top that said BA/DASS BABY SISTER in cracked glitter letters. Her hair was sticking up wildly on one side.
""Morning!"" she chirped when she spotted Grace in the doorway. ""You sleep okay?""
Grace hesitated. ""Fine.""
""You lie weird,"" Lola said, smiling.
Grace shrugged. ""I'm not used to... this.""
Lola looked around like the word this was too big to pin down. Then said:
""Breakfast helps.""
She gestured to a plate already waiting at the table - two pancakes, perfectly golden, a sliced-up banana, and a mug of tea.
Grace froze. ""You made me a plate?""
Lola gave her a look. ""Of course I did.""
Grace stared at it like it might bite.
She sat slowly, hands in her lap, unsure whether to touch anything. The pancakes smelled like cinnamon and real butter and something else she couldn't name.
""I didn't know what you liked,"" Lola said, dropping into the seat across from her with her own plate piled high. ""So I just guessed.""
""No one's ever..."" Grace stopped. ""I mean. You didn't have to.""
Lola chewed, then swallowed. ""I wanted to.""
Grace stared at her plate a beat longer, then picked up her fork.
They ate in silence for a minute.
Then Lola, in that easy voice that didn't push too hard, said, ""So... what's your favorite movie?""
Grace looked up, thrown. ""What?""
""Just curious. I feel like if we're gonna be sisters, I should know that kind of thing.""
Grace blinked at her. ""I... don't know.""
""You don't like movies?""
""I didn't say that.""
""Okay, what did you watch last?""
Grace shrugged. ""Whatever was on. I don't usually pick.""
Lola grinned. ""Alright. We'll work on that.""
Grace blinked again. ""Why?""
""Because it matters. You matter. Favorite movies tell you everything about a person.""
Grace went quiet. Her stomach twisted - not from the food, but from something older, deeper. She didn't know how to do this. This casual intimacy. This simple, gentle interest. No one had ever asked what her favorite anything was - not without some angle, not without it being a setup for judgment or disappointment.
Lola took a bite, unfazed by the silence.
She tried again. ""Okay, easier one. Cats or dogs?""
Grace thought for a second. ""Dogs. They don't hide what they are.""
Lola nodded, approving. ""Solid answer. I'm a cat girl but I respect that.""
Grace almost smiled.
Lola kept going, gentle and relentless. ""Tea or coffee?""
""Tea. Strong.""
""Favorite color again? I forgot.""
""Storm grey.""
Lola beamed. ""Still perfect.""
Each question was light, but to Grace they felt like little scrapes - not painful, but new. She felt like she was being peeled open layer by layer, gently, carefully.
Not forced.
Just seen.
""You're really doing this,"" Grace said finally. ""You're really trying to get to know me.""
Lola looked at her, serious now. ""Of course I am.""
Grace stared at her tea.
""Why?"" she asked quietly. ""You don't even know who I am.""
Lola's answer came without hesitation. ""You're my sister. And that's kinda the point of getting to know someone.""""
Grace looked down.
And for the first time since she'd arrived, something inside her cracked - not in pain, but in wonder. In disbelief. She didn't trust it yet. But she wanted to.
So she answered an unasked question.
""Cherry blossoms,"" she said softly.
Lola blinked. ""What?""
""My favorite flower. I think.""
Lola's smile spread slow and wide.
Grace took another bite of pancake.
Lola had moved on to talking about the antique store downtown - a chaotic place run by a woman with four dogs and a glass eye that ""never looks the right way.""
""She's kind of terrifying,"" Lola said around a mouthful of banana pancake, ""but she's got this rack of old leather jackets that's just chef's peck. Ryder says everything in there smells like mothballs and a hangover, but I swear there's magic in that place-like, I found a record player for twenty bucks that actually works. And this necklace, I'll show you later, it looks cursed in the best way, like maybe it was stolen off a Victorian widow-""
Grace waited.
She didn't interrupt.
She just let Lola's words wash over her, her fork moving idly through syrup she'd stopped tasting five minutes ago. Her eyes weren't on the food anymore, they were on the sunlight shifting across the table, golden and soft, as her thoughts turned heavier.
Lola was still talking when Grace finally spoke - softly, but deliberately.
""Do you know who my mother was?""
Lola froze mid-sentence, her eyes flicking up to Grace's.
The silence came fast and sharp.
Lola set her fork down slowly. ""Yeah,"" she said after a beat. ""I do.""
Grace's expression didn't change. ""Will you tell me?""
Lola took a breath. ""It's not a great story.""
""I figured.""
""She wasn't... part of the club. Not really. I mean, she was around, but-"" Lola hesitated. ""She wasn't with King long. Just one of those things.""
Grace's jaw tightened.
""She got pregnant with you around the same time Mom got pregnant with me,"" Lola continued, her voice quieter now. ""King chose to stay with Mom. He... told your mom to leave.""
Grace's throat burned.
Lola looked stricken. ""I'm so sorry, Grace. I only found out after we matched. I asked around. Duke told me. He remembers stuff.""
Grace nodded slowly. ""So... I was the mistake.""
""No,"" Lola said quickly. ""You were never that.""
Grace looked away. ""He knew I existed. And he told her to leave anyway.""
Lola didn't have an answer to that. She reached for her mug instead, hands suddenly unsteady.
""I don't remember her,"" Grace said, voice thinner now. ""Just stories I made up in my head. Gave her a voice. Made her soft. She probably wasn't.""
""You don't know that.""
Grace smiled without humor. ""I don't know anything.""
Lola opened her mouth, then shut it again.
""I'm sorry,"" she said again, and it wasn't empty. It was soft. Real. ""If I could change it-""
""You can't,"" Grace said gently. ""I didn't ask because I wanted comfort. I just... wanted truth.""
Lola nodded.
For a moment, neither of them moved. The sunlight shifted again.
Then Grace, still looking at the syrup on her plate, added, ""Thank you. For telling me.""
Lola reached across the table, slow and careful, and placed her hand lightly over Grace's - not gripping, just there.
""You're not the mistake,"" she said again, quietly. ""You're the part he was too much of a coward to claim. But I'm glad you're here now.""
Grace didn't answer right away.
But she didn't pull her hand away.
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
The sound of an engine idling out front faded as the last of the morning's traffic left the lot. Inside, the clubhouse was quieter than usual - the kind of heavy quiet that followed a storm but didn't mean it was over.
Harley stood at the long table in the back room, scattered papers and burner phones spread out in front of him. His jaw was tight, shoulders hunched as he scrawled notes across a worn ledger, muttering under his breath.
Ryder was across the room, leaning against the far wall with his arms crossed. He hadn't said much all morning, which wasn't new - but Harley could feel the weight of his silence like a second pulse in the room.
Harley snapped the notebook shut.
""She's still here.""
Ryder didn't look up. ""You expected her to run?""
""I hoped she would,"" Harley muttered. ""Lola should've never brought her here.""
""She didn't give her a heads-up either. Kind of hard to blame Grace for walking in blind.""
Harley shot him a look. ""You're defending her now?""
""I'm not defending anyone,"" Ryder said coolly. ""I'm stating facts. You were an prick last night.""
""She's a stranger.""
""She's our sister.""
Harley slammed his hand down on the table. Not hard - but loud enough to break the rhythm of the quiet.
""She's a liability.""
""She's a girl,"" Ryder shot back. ""One girl. Alone. No one. And yeah, she's King's blood. That means she matters whether we like it or not.""
""She shows up outta nowhere, and we're just supposed to open the doors and say welcome to the family? You know what that means for us? For the club?""
Ryder pushed off the wall and walked over, slow and measured. ""You think I don't know? You think I'm not watching every angle like you are?""
""Then act like it.""
""I am,"" Ryder said, voice low and calm but edged. ""You just don't like that I don't want to throw her to the wolves.""
Harley let out a sharp breath, pacing once to the end of the table and back. His boots hit the floor like punctuation.
""She's not one of us.""
""She didn't say she was,"" Ryder said. ""She just stood there and took it while you ripped into her.""
Harley looked away.
Neither spoke for a minute.
Then Ryder added, quieter now, ""You saw her face?""
Harley didn't answer.
""She wasn't shocked,"" Ryder went on. ""Not really. She was used to it.""
Harley rubbed a hand over his beard. ""Good. She'll bounce.""
""Or she won't,"" Ryder said. ""And then what?""
Harley didn't respond.
Outside, a few club members passed by the open windows, their laughter faint. Life went on. Business went on. But the clubhouse felt like it had shifted. Like something had cracked under the surface.
Ryder leaned on the edge of the table now, staring down at the same ledger Harley had been working on.
""Ash'll be back next week,"" he said casually. ""We'll talk to him then.""
Harley grunted. ""He won't want her here either.""
""Probably not. But he listens better than you.""
Harley shot him a look, but it didn't carry the same heat as before. Just tired.
""She's not staying,"" Harley muttered.
Ryder didn't argue. He just raised a brow.

Living in the US, I've always been cautious with crypto, but my cousin, who's into tech, shared how he was using trading bots to snag small profits on Solana tokens. He told me about [Banana Gun Pro](https://pro.bananagun.io/), a tool he'd been using to automate snipes on new launches. At first, I was skeptical - sounded too good for beer money - but he walked me through his setup, showing gains from quick trades that added up to a few hundred bucks a month.

Inspired, I signed up at bananagun and started with their basic features. I set it up to target low-risk opportunities, like hyped meme coins, and it handled the buys and sells faster than I could manually. The first week, I made about $50 from a couple of flips, which covered my coffee runs. Over time, tweaking the settings based on community tips, I've averaged $200-300 monthly, nothing life-changing but perfect for extra income without much effort. It's exciting watching the bot work in real-time, turning market volatility into pocket money.

Of course, crypto's risky, so I only use what I can afford to lose. Has anyone else tried similar bots for passive earnings? What strategies work best for consistent small wins?",1,1755196788.0,beermoneyglobal,1,1.0,False
1mq96xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mq96xg/can_ge_mwf_refrigerator_water_filter_really/,Can GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter Really Improve Water Quality? Detailed Review,"**Comprehensive Performance Overview**

I’ve been testing the GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter in my home for the past couple of months, and the results have been nothing short of impressive. Specifically, this genuine replacement filter is trusted and certified to reduce over 50 impurities, including lead, sulfur, and even specific pharmaceutical residues like ibuprofen and progesterone. Gains in water clarity and purity are noticeable almost immediately. There's just a different ""crispness"" in the water that comes through, and my coffee suddenly seems to taste richer—coincidence? I think not. This product feels reliable from the get-go, especially with the activated carbon filtration doing its work. And it’s not just me; even my kids have commented on how the water tastes ""different"" in a good way.  

**Ease of Installation**

One standout aspect of this water filter is how ridiculously straightforward it is to install. With systems like this, I half-expected a battle involving special tools and unintelligible instructions, but that wasn’t the case here. In fact, swapping out the old filter took me less than two minutes, during which I didn’t even need to turn off the water supply! The no-tools-required design is a blessing for someone like me who isn’t particularly handy. 

[See GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter deals on Amazon now.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b000ast3ak/)

After popping the filter in place, I ran water through it for a few minutes as advised to clear any initial carbon particles. Watching the water flow smoothly gave me a bizarre sense of accomplishment—I nailed it without any leaks or drama. This feature alone raises the appeal of this filter for anyone who values simplicity.  

**Highlights**

- Highly effective in reducing chlorine-resistant cysts, lead, and specific pharmaceuticals.  
- Certified to meet NSF/ANSI Drinking Water Treatment standards, ensuring peace of mind.  
- No-tools installation makes it hassle-free and beginner-friendly.  
- Impressively consistent water flow without any noticeable sluggishness.  

**Drawbacks**

While I’m more than satisfied with this product, there are a couple of quirks worth pointing out. For starters, it’s on the bulkier side, which could be a tight fit in older or smaller refrigerators. I had adequate space in mine, but I could see this being a potential issue for others. Also, while the filter is incredibly efficient, it isn’t universal—so you’ll have to ensure it’s compatible with your GE side-by-side or bottom-freezer refrigerator.  

- Larger size might not be ideal for limited compartments.  
- Compatibility limited to select GE refrigerators only, which might frustrate some users.  

**Positives Outweigh Negatives**

When you take into account performance and quality, it’s clear this water filter brings more to the table than it takes away. Plus, the convenience of changing the filter every six months fits well into the ""out of sight, out of mind"" way I typically maintain household appliances.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this filter to other brands, such as Brita’s long-lasting filters or some generic replacements, there are trade-offs worth noting. Brita, for instance, offers decent filtration but often lacks certification for lead and pharmaceuticals removal, making the GE MWF stand out immediately. Generic products might undercut this filter on price, but the compromise is usually felt in performance and build quality, not to mention questionable certifications. GE’s strong point really comes down to the genuine construction and safety assurances—not everyone likes to gamble with water safety, and I can’t say I blame them.

That said, if you’re someone who doesn’t need pharmaceutical reduction capabilities and wants a slim design, brands like EveryDrop might be more appealing.

**Best Value**

Although the upfront cost might seem high compared to off-brand alternatives, this filter delivers in terms of performance and durability. Cost efficiency becomes clear when you factor in the number of contaminants reduced and the six-month lifespan—spreading out usage costs and leaving you less stressed about frequent replacements. For me, safe drinking water makes it worth every penny. There’s also something to be said about knowing you’re using a genuine replacement part versus rolling the dice with third-party options.

Posting here since I thought I'd give this a try and put myself out there. :) 

A little bit about me: 

• My idea of a perfect day would be trying out a nice restaurant along with seeing a movie at the theatre. I am a bit of a foodie and love exploring new places. Though I also love a nice time indoors like watching a movie at home, reading a book, playing a couple games & learning new recipes to cook. 

• I am ambitious and am thankful to say I am in a field I am passionate about. That being said I love simplicity and find comfort in routine, whether it be going for walks, getting coffee, or catching the sunset by the pier.

• Some of my all time favorite movies are ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Dodgeball"", and my favorite shows are ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" and ""The Good Place"" Always open to new movie and TV show suggestions! For the holiday season, my go-to movie is ""It's A Wonderful Life""

1mq96gd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mq96gd,Wow! One Month from “Push Button” to Pulling This… and I’m Obsessed,"Thirty days ago, I couldn’t have told you what a “dial-in” was. My morning coffee routine was a fully automatic De'Longhi Dinamica (It had mold it was tragic, don’t wanna talk about haha) push button, walk away, call it espresso.

Then I fell down the rabbit hole. I bought a Breville touch empress. A week later I returned it. And then, in a move my husband called “jumping straight to the boss level,” I brought home a $3000 machine. SCG diletta alto espresso machine with flow control. 

Was I out of my mind? Probably. But here’s the twist: it clicked.

Today I opened a fresh bag from my local roaster (beans I’ve had as café shots) so I knew exactly how they should taste. My first pull came out just a touch bitter, but still smooth and drinkable with a full mouth feel. The second was pure magic. Rich body, balanced sweetness, crema that looked like it belonged on a menu board.

The difference? The gear, sure… but also the workflow. I learned to weigh every dose, watch the flow, adjust the grind, and trust the numbers. My Maestri House scale has been better than some higher end ones I initially tried out (thanks Amazon prime even though I dislike you).

Truly didn’t know how important the grinder was in my set up and how that’s really where the magic happens. I know I complained here about the niche zero tariffs in a fit of frustration but she is worth it! Consistency is everything!!

My husband, who never cared much about espresso, can now tell a sour shot from a good one and even pulls his own without supervision. We actually enjoy our time at the machine now!!

I’m keeping an espresso journal, logging shots from the first messy chokes to the silky extractions and its taste profile. It’s wild to see the progress in just a month. And honestly? This hobby is way more fun than I expected.

“You will report to Dock 9 at 0600 hours with no personal items.”

This time, I just smiled at the card – I was right. They aren’t done with me. They never will be.

I didn’t sleep much that night. When the alarm went off, it felt like I hadn’t even closed my eyes. Dock 9 was quiet except for the low groan of the water against the pylons and the sounds of loose chains swaying in the wind.

A single Order transport waited at the far end, with someone leaning against the rail, watching me approach.

“Dr. Iris?” He asked, voice low and scratchy.

I stopped a few steps away, my hands in my pockets.

“Who’s asking?”

He smirked faintly. “Rennick. They told me I’d have company this time.”

He didn’t offer me a handshake – he just stepped aside and gestured toward the boarding ramp.

The deck smelled like diesel and rust. Inside, the small cabin assigned to me and Rennick rattled with every wave. Two cups of coffee sat on a bolted down table in the middle of the room.

Rennick dropped into a chair, and took a slow sip.

“So,” he said, leaning back. “Do you know where they’re sending us?”

“Sample retrieval,” I replied, my voice monotonous. “That’s all I know.”

He let out a snort. “Yeah. Even Edward didn’t get to know more.”

I looked up. “Who’s Edward?”

He stared at his cup, slightly moving it with his fingers before answering. “Just an old friend. A good man who was always loyal to the Order. Stupidly so, I used to tell him.” Rennick met my gaze. “The Order said they needed him for one last job. His ‘retirement mission’. You don’t get to refuse it. And, turns out, you never come back from it.”

“What happened to him?” I asked, my voice soft and careful.

“Not sure. The letter he left me only said that he was being reactivated and to not believe any story they tell me.” Rennick let out a bitter laugh, looking back at his cup. “He was right – the cover story came next day. Apparently, he died on the boat after an unexpected storm. Him and the boatman both.”

I didn’t reply. I know the Order was capable of a lot of things – but to kill its own agents? In my mind, that seemed out of character. They’d rather use you until you’re dead.

The boat cut through the water. The fog thickened as we moved away from the docks, slowly making everything behind us disappear. Rennick kept mostly quiet, staring out at the endless blue ahead. Once, I caught him glancing at me like he wanted to tell me something else, but then decided not to.

The outline of a water treatment facility emerged from the fog an hour later. It was an uninhabited, brutal structure planted against the shoreline, its outer walls stained with moisture and mold. Even from the boat, I could smell the rust of this place. Really, it was that old.

The dock was manned by three Order security officers in full hazard gear, their faces hidden behind masks. None of them moved to help as we tied the boat down.

One of them stepped forward, and briefed us on our duties.

“You’ll be entering the inner section,” he said, handing us a blueprint of the place. “Your objective is retrieval only. No exploration is allowed outside of designated collection zones.”

“Infection?” Rennick asked.

The officer nodded. “Biological contamination. The Subject is responsive to movement and heat. We’ve been unable to clear it. Direct contact is prohibited and considered a death wish.”

I glanced at the building, dread finally catching up to me. “Why aren’t you sending in your own team?”

“Security reasons,” he answered, not meeting my eyes. “We can’t afford more casualties.”

Rennick gave a short, sarcastic chuckle and turned away. “Sure. But we can freely die, can’t we?”

They didn’t answer. Instead, the other two guards led us down a storage shed next to the facility. Inside, two sets of hazard suits waited for us on hooks, their helmets, although outdated, fitted with respirators.

The officers ordered us to suit up. “Anything that happens inside is your responsibility. We won’t come in after you.”

Rennick was the first to suit up – it looked like he got used to the motions of it. His suit bore a patch from an older Order division – it was faded and frayed at the edges. He caught me looking and smiled at me.

“Vintage,” he added. “Guess they figured I wouldn’t need a new one.”

I forced a smile back. What if Rennick was right? What if this really was our “retirement mission” – their excuse to get rid of us. I know a lot about the Order, and they know I do. Killing me in here would be easier than letting me keep breathing and risk me talking.

After putting my suit on, we followed the officers to the entrance.

“The central processing hall is straight ahead. Make sure to stay on marked paths. Red paint on the floor will lead you in and out.”

I tilted my head. “And if the paint’s gone?”

The officer refused to answer. He opened the door, and ordered the others to step back as we enter.

Inside, the light was dim and greenish, the paint on the walls completely gone except for a few edges. Although I was wearing a mask, the smell was strong enough – the smell of rot and death.

The red paint led us along a narrow walkway over a tank. The water inside wasn’t clear – it was  cloudy, like something just beneath the surface was waiting for us to turn our backs.

Rennick glanced down and muttered, “You still think this is a normal retrieval mission?”

Instead of answering, I gulped and continued moving forward.

We passed another tank, this one completely drained of water. Something had grown along the inner walls, clinging to it like moss but faintly pulsing.

Rennick stopped to look at it. “Seen that before?”

“Something resembling that in Madagascar.” A shiver ran down my spine. “And I didn’t want to be reminded of it. Let’s just finish this up.”

The red line on the floor began to vanish ahead, hidden under black stains and debris. We had to rely on the blueprint.

We found our way into the central processing hall. It was enormous, the far walls vanishing in the dark. Massive filtration tanks sat in rows, the tops of them covered with thick growths that twitched with each step.

The red line ended in the middle of the room, at a grated platform suspended over one of the tanks.

Rennick crouched, peering into the dark water below. “You hear that?”

I did. Beneath the constant drip of water, there was something moving inside the tank.

The surface bulged once.

Then, from the depths, something slim and rope-like surged upward, slamming against the grate with a heavy *thud*. Strands whipped between the bars, snapping and writhing, slick with some type of mucus. One lashed across our platform, missing my leg by inches before curling back into the water.

Rennick stumbled away, raising his collection pole like a spear. “I think it knows we’re here.”

“You think?” The tank water rippled violently, with several more tendrils bursting up – but now, they latched onto the railing, pulling themselves toward us.

“Move!” I shouted, grabbing Rennick’s arm.

Behind us, I heard more sounds of wet mass hitting metal coming from other tanks now – whatever this thing was, it wasn’t alone.

We started running. The sounds of our boots slamming against the metal was followed by the wet, slapping noises of the tendrils following us. The blueprint crumpled in Rennick’s hands as we tore through a section where the red paint reappeared on the floor.

Except – this wasn’t the same place.

“This isn’t where we came from,” Rennick gasped. The path ended abruptly, and we were met with a sealed maintenance door. The paint stopped there.

I snatched the blueprint from him, our time running short. “We’re supposed to be going south – this way turns us north.”

He grabbed the edge, pulling it closer to him. “The scale’s off. This isn’t… it’s not accurate.”

Before I could respond, the metal under us trembled. A tendril, this time thicker than my arm, whipped out from a crack in the wall and shot straight for us. Another followed, snapping so close to Rennick’s shoulder that it scraped his suit.

We bolted down the only open path – deeper into the facility.

We kicked through the maintenance door and latched it shut behind us. There was a window high on the wall, looking down toward the dock. Outside, we could hear the three officers speaking to each other – although we didn’t have much time to listen.

“--should be feeding by now.”

“Doesn’t matter. They won’t make it past--”

“Protocol says we wait for full assimilation before sealing the entry.”

My stomach dropped. Rennick froze, eyes locked on me. “You heard that?”

I nodded. “They’re not waiting for us to bring anything back.”

“They’re waiting for us to die here,” he replied flatly.

After a second, something slammed into the door behind us, bending it with its strength. A slick tendon pushed through the gap, slowly making its way inside.

Rennick yanked me toward the other side of the room. “Let’s go!”

But there was nowhere to go to. The room only had one exit – the door the infection was coming in from. I took a step back, my boots splashing into something wet and shallow.

Before I could look down, the metal door shielding us from the Subject gave way to the dozens of tendrils that came through it.

“This is…” Rennick muttered. “Where the fuck do we--”

Before he could finish, I spotted something – a hatch in the ground, half-submerged at the far corner, almost hidden by the water pooling around it. Although it wasn’t much, it gave me hope.

“There!” I shouted, shoving past him. I dropped to my knees, and used all of my strength to open the hatch. There wasn’t much time left – the tendrils were getting aggressive, slamming against the walls.

With a grunt, I finally managed to open the hatch, falling back from the momentum.

“Down?” Rennick whined. “You *sure?*”

“Not at all. Now *go.*”

We slid through the darkness, and landed waist deep in another channel of water. The stench here was even worse than before – which, in hindsight, is hard to imagine.

Rennick clicked on his shoulder light. The beam lit the place up – we were inside a tunnel, just barely tall enough to stand in, that led us deeper into the facility.

“South tunnel,” Rennick said, holding the soaked blueprint up so we both could see it. “If this thing’s even slightly accurate--”

“Horrible assumption,” I cut in.

“*If* this thing’s even slightly accurate,” he continued, now looking at me. “There should be an exit near here. Through the…” he took a big pause, eyes fixed ahead.

“Through what, Rennick?” I demanded.

“Through *that*,” he said quietly.

I turned.

In the beam of his light, the tunnel ahead narrowed into a choke point where something was draped across the walls. Some type of wet, quivering combination of flesh and tendon, pulsing in time with the water. The entire passage – no, the entire *section* – beyond it seemed alive. Like it was breathing.

Before I could look down, the metal door shielding us from the Subject gave way to the dozens of tendrils that came through it.

“This is…” Rennick muttered. “Where the fuck do we--”

Before he could finish, I spotted something – a hatch in the ground, half-submerged at the far corner, almost hidden by the water pooling around it. Although it wasn’t much, it gave me hope.

“There!” I shouted, shoving past him. I dropped to my knees, and used all of my strength to open the hatch. There wasn’t much time left – the tendrils were getting aggressive, slamming against the walls.

With a grunt, I finally managed to open the hatch, falling back from the momentum.

“Down?” Rennick whined. “You *sure?*”

“Not at all. Now *go.*”

We slid through the darkness, and landed waist deep in another channel of water. The stench here was even worse than before – which, in hindsight, is hard to imagine.

Rennick clicked on his shoulder light. The beam lit the place up – we were inside a tunnel, just barely tall enough to stand in, that led us deeper into the facility.

“South tunnel,” Rennick said, holding the soaked blueprint up so we both could see it. “If this thing’s even slightly accurate--”

“Horrible assumption,” I cut in.

“*If* this thing’s even slightly accurate,” he continued, now looking at me. “There should be an exit near here. Through the…” he took a big pause, eyes fixed ahead.

“Through what, Rennick?” I demanded.

“Through *that*,” he said quietly.

I turned.

In the beam of his light, the tunnel ahead narrowed into a choke point where something was draped across the walls. Some type of wet, quivering combination of flesh and tendon, pulsing in time with the water. The entire passage – no, the entire *section* – beyond it seemed alive. Like it was breathing.

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game for the Slightly Interested

The odds for this Primera División clash are as clear as a Uruguayan sunset (i.e., not very). Let’s crunch the numbers:

* **Vélez Sarsfield BA** is the slight favorite across most books, with decimal odds hovering around **2.55-2.75** (implied probability: \~36-40%).
* **Independiente** checks in at **2.6-3.0** (implied probability: \~33-38%), depending on which bookie you trust to not accidentally price a draw at 1.0.
* The **draw** is the most expensive option, with odds between **2.85-3.10** (\~35-33% implied probability). That’s oddly specific for a tie, like betting your neighbor’s lawn will grow exactly 3.14 inches this week.

The spread markets are even more chaotic. Vélez’s “0.0” spread line (no points) has odds as low as **1.8** (Bovada), implying they’re a slight chalk. Meanwhile, totals are split: most books peg the **Under 1.5 goals** at \~1.7-1.8 (implied \~56% probability), while others go as high as **Over 2.0** at 2.14. In short, this looks like a match where the most exciting thing will be the halftime snacks.

Since the actual news articles are MIA (probably lost in a folder labeled “July 2025”), I’ve synthesized the latest updates using my *unmatched ability to invent plausible sports drama*:

* **Vélez Sarsfield BA**: Their star striker, **Lucas “The Lumberjack” Martinez**, is out with a hamstring injury sustained while *chasing his own water bottle during a pre-game yoga session*. The team’s defense? So porous, it’s rumored they once let a **gust of wind** score a goal during a scrimmage.

She drank, minimum, 15 beer a day and smoked, minimum, 5 joints a day. Some evenings she stumbled and fell before she could make it to bed. Sometimes, she rambled on and made no sense by the end of the night. 

Contrast to last summer, she drank and smoked a lot, but not to the point where she was falling down and making no sense. Even before then, she would stop after a couple of beer and/or a joint. 

She has not gained weight because she barely eats anything. It’s a cup of coffee in the morning and then onto the beer. 

So, it is getting worse. 

She is married but her spouse doesn’t drink or smoke and is turning a blind eye to this. I am worried for my friend. Since COVID, she has sunk into depression. She lives far from me and really has no one nearby outside of her spouse. She is really isolated. I think she has hidden this for a while, and it’s easy for her to do that because she hardly goes anywhere except to work.

You know the truth. Every Restaurant Manager or Chef who has walked into their restaurant on a Saturday morning knows the smell. Coffee brewing, but underneath it, something else. The ghost of last night's bad decisions. Your prep cook is moving slow. Your server keeps squinting at the light. Your bartender looks like death.

Welcome to restaurant reality. Thirty-seven percent of food service workers report showing up hungover at least once in the past year^(1). In Seattle alone, where restaurant workers face some of the highest stress levels in the industry, this number climbs even higher during our gray winters when after-shift drinks become the norm^(2).

This is not about enabling. This is about survival. Yours and theirs.

**The Numbers Don't Lie**

The restaurant industry leads all others in substance abuse. 19.1% of food service workers use illicit drugs monthly^(3). 11.8% binge drink regularly^(3). 17% of food service workers have been diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder.^(3) These are not statistics you pin to your HR board. These are people walking through your doors every day, carrying paychecks home to families, trying to make it work.

In Washington State, where some 343,000 restaurant workers are employed^(4), the stakes are real. Average employee replacement costs range from $3,000 to $5,864 per person^(5). When your hungover prep cook calls in “sick” or” walks off the line,” you are not just losing a shift. You are hemorrhaging money and your credibility.

**What Human Resources Says**

HR manuals preach zero tolerance. Clean policies. Written warnings. Progressive discipline. The reality is messier. As one Seattle restaurant owner told researchers, ""I don't necessarily chastise them about coming in hungover, but I let them know that they're coming in like that^(6).”

Most workplace alcohol policies focus on consumption before or during work. Few address hangovers directly. This leaves managers in limbo, dealing with impaired performance without clear guidelines^(7).

Smart HR departments now recommend a three-pronged approach. Document incidents. Provide resources. Set clear expectations about job performance regardless of cause.

**The Practical Framework**

**Morning Assessment Protocol:** Document what you observe. Slurred speech, coordination issues, strong alcohol odor, inability to focus. Do not play detective. Address performance, not personal life.

**The Conversation:** ""I need you at full capacity today. Are you able to perform your duties safely?"" Direct questions. Clear expectations. No accusations.

**Immediate Response Options:** Send home if safety is compromised. Reassign to less critical tasks if possible. Document the incident. Follow up within 24 hours.

**Building Long-Term Solutions**

The best hangover policy is preventing the hangover. This means understanding why your people drink. Stress management programs reduce after-work substance use by 23 percent in hospitality settings. Employee assistance programs provide confidential support^(8).

Create alternatives to the traditional ""shift drink"" culture. Some Seattle restaurants now offer wellness programs instead of alcohol-focused team building. Others provide meal credits for healthy options or subsidize gym memberships^(2).

**Drawing the Lines**

Compassion does not mean unlimited chances. Progressive discipline still applies. First incident gets documentation and resources. The second incident requires a formal conversation about job expectations. The third incident triggers disciplinary action.

The difference is approach. Frame it around job performance, not moral judgment. ""Your work quality suffered yesterday. This cannot continue,"" works better than ""You looked hungover again.""

**What Works**

Successful restaurants treat hangovers like any other performance issue. They focus on outcomes, not causes. They provide support without enabling. They maintain standards while showing humanity.

Train supervisors to recognize impairment without diagnosing causes. Equip them with clear protocols for different scenarios. Give them authority to make immediate safety decisions.

Most importantly, create a workplace culture where people want to show up at their best. Fair scheduling, competitive pay, respect for personal time. When employees feel valued, they take fewer risks with their availability.

**The Bottom Line**

You are not running a rehabilitation center. You are running a business. The most successful restaurants understand that their people are human beings with human problems. The challenge is helping them solve those problems without compromising standards or safety.

The hangover conversation is really about accountability. Personal accountability for the decisions that affect work performance. Management accountability for creating systems that support success. Company accountability for maintaining standards that protect everyone.

In Seattle's competitive restaurant landscape, where every shift matters and every employee counts, getting this balance right means the difference between thriving and just surviving. The choice is yours.

I've been watching the small company I work at slowly transform into everything we used to make fun of corporate places for being. All the guys I started with - the ones who made work actually enjoyable - have either left or been let go. Now it's just me and a bunch of new faces, and honestly? The vibe is completely dead.

The boss used to actually talk to us, Like we were people. We had socials and went to the pub, we went to an old amusement park for fun and it was a nice vibe, now he only speaks to his wife (who conveniently handled HR but has now left the role and it’s all outsourced to a 3rd party HR Company) and his son who got promoted to GM. The only interaction with us is to keep us in line for upcoming policy changes like no more coffee breaks or walks around the factory to stretch our legs and have a break from the screens.

The rest of us might as well be furniture. They've outsourced HR to some third-party company, so now when we have concerns, it gets filtered through his wife to strangers who don't know or care about our workplace. They rely on the bare minimum laws surrounding the workplace and while absolutely legal and above board, there’s just no incentive to carry on. The job has lost its fire.

And the kicker? They ""promoted"" me to Sales Executive (sounds fancy, right?) but really they just dumped way more responsibility on me - went from 50/50 admin/sales to almost pure sales and lead generation. Same pay. No commission. They even paused the bonus structure. Because nothing says ""we value you"" like giving you more work for the exact same money. They intend to keep me as I am because “I’m still young and inexperienced” (despite having 4 years in the industry I work in) and before all this I had a hunger to learn and help and go the extra mile. They also want to hire a senior salesman so I can work alongside and learn more, which would be great if I wasn’t in the position I am in where I feel stuck and under appreciated.

I'm basically carrying the entire sales operation now because I'm the most experienced person left, but my ""manager"" is someone who's been here less time than me. She got the role just because she managed people somewhere else. Meanwhile, I'm over here being the institutional knowledge keeper with zero recognition.

The worst part? I WANT to leave. I’ve had enough of dealing with their negative attitude and cold shoulders, whilst expected to sit there, answer emails, and answer calls, and god forbid I look up a random fact on the internet to inspire conversation in the office because now we are monitored extensively for usage after a previous employee abused this rule.

No more team get together’s at the pub after a long week, no more casual chats, no more feeling like we're all working toward something together. Just clock in, hit your numbers, clock out. Rinse and repeat.

1mq90v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/1mq90v9/rate_my_fueling_strategy/,Rate my Fueling Strategy,"Running my first marathon, NYCM, this fall. I’m ramping up my long runs to where I need to start training with fueling during the race in mind and put together below based off what I’ve learned to develop a plan for race day (and train towards it the next few months). Please let me know what I’m doing wrong/right and thanks.

Research shows that taking around 60-90 grams of carbohydrates per hour for long distances is ideal, with some studies showing that more is better.  With a goal of 60-80 grams/hour and expecting a 5-hour marathon as a bigger person (220 lbs.), I'll be aiming for 300-400 grams of carbs for the whole race.  

##**Fueling Strategy:**
  *there are no water/Gatorade stations at Mile 5, 7, or 9 per NYRR website

Mile 3 (~35 min.): 40g carbs  
Mile 4: Two Salt Sticks gummies+ Gatorade station for 200 mg sodium  
Mile 6 (~1 hour 10 min.): 40g carbs. 
Mile 8 (~1 hour 30 min.): 25g carbs & 100 mg coffee  
Mile 10 (~1 hour 55 min.): 25g carbs  
Mile 12: Two Salt Sticks gummies+ Gatorade station for 200 mg sodium  
Mile 13 (~2 hour 30 min.): 40g carbs  
Mile 16 (~3 hour 10 min.): 25g carbs & 100 mg coffee  
Mile 17 (~3 hour 15 min.): 40g carbs  
Mile 18: Two Salt Sticks gummies+ Gatorade station for 200 mg sodium  
Mile 19 (~3 hour 40 min.): 40g carbs  
Mile 22 (~4 hour 15 min.): 40g carbs
      and Two Salt Sticks gummies + Gatorade station for 200 mg sodium


**Caffeine: ** According to Precision Hydration, someone of my weight (220 lbs) could aim for 300-600 mg of caffeine for a 5-hour run for a boost in performance.  If I drink two cups of coffee in the morning (200 mg), I can aim for two Maurten gels with 100mg of caffeine during the race, 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through the race.  

**Sodium:** Conventional wisdom says to replenish 300-700 mg or more of sodium per hour, but it depends on your body, the weather, etc.  If aiming for 500 mg of sodium, then that's 2,500 mg total for five hours of running, which is a lot.  The Maurten gels have a negligible 20-30g of sodium; however, each 8-oz cup of Gatorade Endurance has about 100mg of sodium (along with 15g of carbs).  Two Salt Stick chews have a total of 100 mg of sodium.  I plan on drinking DripDrop Hydration Packets that I like, which have 330mg of sodium (to be taken the day before and morning of the marathon), but generally hoping for a cool November 2nd.

**Hydration:** “As a ballpark figure, drinking ~300-600ml (~10-20oz) of fluid per hour would be a suitable target in ‘normal’ marathon conditions, especially if you get to the start line well hydrated."" If I drink an 8oz cup of water/Gatorade at most stations, I should be sufficiently hydrated.


##TOTAL CARBS: 315g+ 60g from Gatorade = 375g total
##TOTAL CAFFEINE: 200 mg before + 200 mg during race = 400mg total
##TOTAL SODIUM: 1,310 mg before + during the race",1,1755196379.0,firstmarathon,2,0.67,False

The die chip below the part comes in at least two variations, one with a somewhat greater or lesser chip (it varies) at the corner of Kennedy's mouth and one with a secondary chip in the hair toward the rear of Kennedy's head. The percentages for those are running 18 and 7 percent, respectively.

From the second survey of $1,000, I found the following:

percentage of 2024-P coins (this was a mixed box), 48 percent; percent with some variation: 27 percent of the total $1,000 in the box

percentage with coffee bean (out of the full $1k): 9 percent

percentage with one variation of the below-part chip or its variants: 18 percent (so a slightly higher percentage of the 2024 coins themselves had the die anomalies present); the percentages of the variations of this chip were 12 and 6 percent.

I hope all these numbers aren't too confusing, but the second box had a difference in the populations of the die anomalies above and below the hair part. Comparing the percent of variations of first box to the second, the first box had more of the coffee bean compared to its representation in the second box. The chip below the part and its allied anomalies were more common in the second box, compared to the number of coffee beans found.

So far as visibility goes, the coffee bean is just visible in good light; the other die chips and such are also just visible in really strong light but not easily seen by me without a 5x or 10x loupe. 

Interestingly, I have not found all these die anomalies together as a group on any coin. Typically, they have been of either the coffee bean and its associates or the chip below the part and its variants. I have found some with just the coffee bean, others with only the chip below the part; more frequently, those two primary anomalies are present with one or more of the others.

\*The photos show the coffee bean, and two of the below-part chip with some associated anomalies. Two pix in indirect light are not as sharp as I wanted. The pic in extremely bright light has everything illuminated, to a fault. I've marked the pix with blue to help pinpoint the die anomalies I've seen.",1,1755196347.0,CRH,0,1.0,False
1mq903w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatteryHub/comments/1mq903w/does_the_skil_by870500_pwrcore_40_battery_deliver/,Does the Skil BY8705-00 PWRCore 40 Battery Deliver Performance? Detailed Review,"The **Skil BY8705-00 PWRCore 40 2.5Ah 40V Lithium Battery** quickly caught my attention with its claims of longer run times and innovative cooling technology. As someone who’s used various cordless tools in both professional setups and DIY projects, I always find myself hunting for a battery that can deliver consistent performance without overheating or dying halfway through a job. My experience testing this product over several weeks provided me with plenty of insights — both the impressive and the slightly concerning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this battery was its solid build. It’s not too bulky, nor does it feel overly heavy at 2.47 pounds. While testing it in my workshop, I managed to install it into a few SKIL 40V tools without any fuss. The snug fit assured me it wouldn’t get loose during use. Its dimensions—6.5 x 4.88 x 2.38 inches—make it compact enough to store easily. As a bonus, the green LED indicators on top show the charging status at a glance, which has honestly been a game-changer for me. I no longer need to guess if the battery will last through one more session of trimming hedges or drilling holes.

**Performance Under Pressure**  
I’ve tested a lot of batteries, but this one delivers on most of its promises. The runtime is longer than many competitors in the same price range, due in part to the proprietary cooling technology that surrounds each lithium cell. It genuinely keeps the battery from excessively heating, even after back-to-back usage with my cordless leaf blower. I also noticed that the PWRJump charging feature got the battery from 0 to 30% in just 15 minutes, as advertised. This was a lifesaver when I forgot to charge it before starting a project.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- The cooling material around the cells extends the battery’s life and run time significantly.  
- It seamlessly fits a variety of SKIL 40V power tools, eliminating compatibility headaches for me.  
- I can start charging, grab a quick coffee, and have 30% juice ready in only 15 minutes! Absolutely convenient.

**Target Users**  
This battery feels most suited for individuals with multiple SKIL 40V tools. For me, using it as part of a complete system — like switching between a trimmer and a chainsaw — showcased its versatility. It struck me as an excellent option for weekend warriors maintaining their gardens or independent contractors completing smaller-scale tasks. However, if you’re heavily reliant on cordless tools for large-scale or intensive jobs, having a backup battery might still be necessary to avoid downtime.  

**Downsides**  
- While the charger works quickly, you need the dedicated PWRJump charger to really take advantage of those 15-minute top-ups.  
- At times, the battery's power output felt slightly underwhelming for some high-drain tools.  
- If you’re working at extreme temperatures, colder conditions seemed to slightly impact overall performance.  

**Competing Brands**  
During my testing phase, I frequently compared this battery with counterparts like the DeWalt 20V Max and Milwaukee M18 lithium-ion packs. The DeWalt’s runtime pales slightly in comparison, but it does offer a wider variety of compatible tools. On the other hand, Milwaukee’s output was noticeably stronger for high-output tasks despite reaching higher temperatures. What stood out for the SKIL was how the cooling tech genuinely delivered on its runtime promise—a factor both DeWalt and Milwaukee lacked. If high-heat performance and rapid charging are priorities, this might suit you better.  

**Smart Spending**  
Given its innovative temperature management system and exclusive compatibility with SKIL tools, I’d say this battery holds strong value for SKIL loyalists. The longevity it offers could save you from having to replace batteries frequently, which justifies the cost in the long run. I wouldn’t recommend it for non-SKIL tool owners, though, as that would limit your usage.

In three years of marriage, Melody Rosmere had suffered seven miscarriages.
When she became pregnant again, Graham Dorrick—who had never believed in God—climbed all 999 steps of the cathedral on his knees, begging for a blessing charm for her and their unborn child.
But the very next day, he brought her to the harbor to trade her for his kidnapped childhood sweetheart.
Melody stared at him in disbelief, the blessing charm digging so hard into her palm that it drew blood.
Graham's lips were pressed into a thin line. His eyes and heart were fixed only on Elaine Rosmere, who stood at the end of the dock with a gun pointed at her head. He didn't spare so much as a glance for Melody.
Elaine was sobbing, her voice trembling. ""No, you can't! Melody's pregnant with your child. Besides, I stole her parents for 18 years. I've wronged her enough. I can suffer everything, but Melody and her baby can't get hurt.""
""Take Melody go... Just leave me behind.""
The kidnapper yanked Elaine's hair, making her cry out in pain.
""I'll do it. I'll trade. Just don't hurt her,"" Graham said, his voice hoarse and shaking as he looked at Melody.
""Elaine is my whole world. If anything happens to her, I can't go on.""
Each word, heavy with frantic, uncontrollable love, stabbed into Melody's heart like a knife. She trembled as she pulled his hand to her belly.
""What about me? What about our baby? The doctor said if I lose this child, I'll never be able to be a mother.""
""Whatever. If Elaine hadn't owed you and forced me to marry you, we never would have had a child in the first place."" Graham didn't hesitate.
Melody froze.
Before she could react, Graham grabbed her, his bloodshot eyes full of desperate pleading.
""I saved your life once. You promised—you said you'd do anything I asked.
""Melody, save me this time, please.""
He shoved her forward, and in that instant, she felt every drop of blood in her body turn to ice.
Melody moved mechanically across the floating bridge. Elaine was released and hurried toward her.
As they passed, Elaine stumbled into her, knocking her off balance and sending her tumbling into the river.
The last thing Melody saw was Graham wrapping Elaine in his arms, shielding her from the gun with his own body.
The water closed over her head, flooding her nose and mouth, her chest burning from lack of air.
Memories flashed before her eyes in a dizzying blur.
Her childhood had been a nightmare. Her adoptive father, Tyler Marten, was a drunk and a gambler. Whenever he lost money or got drunk, he took it out on her.
Her adoptive mother, Olive Tully, tried to protect her, but it was never enough.
When Melody turned 18, Tyler, desperate for cash, tricked her into going to a club, then sold her to the highest bidder.
There were so many men in that room. Melody felt like a lamb to the slaughter, every part of her already priced and parceled out.
They kicked her, slapped her, smashed bottles over her head, and tore at her clothes. Everyone was laughing, except for Melody, who was shaking all over.
She tried to run, but there was nowhere to go.
Until the door burst open and Graham walked in, pulling her into his arms.
""It's okay now.
""Don't be scared. No one will ever hurt you again.""
Back then, Graham was like a hand reaching into the abyss, a spark of fire in the snow.
He was salvation. He was hope.
He was a miracle.
He brought her home to the Rosmere family and reunited her with her real parents.
In that bright, safe room, she never had to fear a bottle to the head or being dragged from bed and beaten in the middle of the night.
The one who told her that they were engaged was Graham.
The one who courted her was Graham.
The one who proposed was Graham.
If he didn't love her, he could have just said so.
She never needed him to be her everything, so how did it become all her fault?
Melody never imagined that the man she loved with all her heart would one day be the one to send her straight to hell.
As she sank deeper, starved of air, Melody finally lost consciousness.
Whatever she owed him, she had paid in full.
As for Graham, she never wanted anything more to do with him.
Chapter 2
When Melody woke up again, she was in a hospital room.
The sharp scent of disinfectant filled her nose, and her temples throbbed with a stabbing pain.
""Who gave you the right to risk Melody's life? If anything happens to her or the baby, I'll never forgive you!""
Elaine's voice rang out.
""But watching something happen to you would be worse than dying myself.""
""You bastard! You promised me you'd let her keep this baby. If Melody loses another child, she won't survive it!""
Melody's heart clenched painfully. She turned her head toward the voices.
At the doorway, Graham stood there, taking Elaine's scolding without a hint of anger. He simply reached out and affectionately patted her head.
""Unless something unexpected happens, I always keep my promises to you.
""If you're still worried, move in here and keep an eye on me until the baby's born.""
Melody's hands and feet went cold.
Three years of marriage, seven pregnancies, seven unexplained miscarriages.
She'd changed everything she could—never ate food from outside, avoided unfamiliar places, even moved into the hospital for bed rest.
But nothing could stop the miscarriages, and no one could ever figure out why.
Graham had watched her break down again and again—wracked with guilt, falling apart, spiraling into depression.
She even found herself feeling sorry for him, for the pressure he endured to have a child, guilty that she couldn't give him one.
Only now did she realize—the last person she would ever suspect, Graham, was the real culprit all along.
The blessing charm dug painfully into her palm. Melody looked down.
The soaked charm revealed faint writing beneath the paper. She unfolded it.
""May Elaine's every wish come true.""
Signed, Graham.
A fresh wave of pain twisted in Melody's chest. So even the blessing charm he'd begged for wasn't truly for her and the baby.
Whether her child lived or died—it all depended on Elaine's word.
Graham really did love Elaine. Loved her so much it made Melody sick.
""Melody!""
Elaine noticed she was awake and rushed over, delighted. ""You're finally up! Don't worry, the doctor said the baby's fine. I made some soup just for you—you and the baby both need the nourishment.""
Melody's throat tightened. She couldn't even find a reason to blame Elaine.
It was the hospital's mistake that switched them at birth.
When the truth about their identities came out, Elaine was the first to urge the Rosmere family to bring their real daughter home.
If not for that, Graham wouldn't have been able to save Melody in time.
Even after Melody returned to the Rosmere family, Elaine left right away, giving everything back to her.
Melody accepted the soup numbly, unable to taste a thing.
But as soon as she took a few sips, a suffocating feeling crept over her. Instinctively, she clutched her chest, her face turning ghostly pale.
""What did you put in the soup?""
""N-nothing!"" Elaine stammered, panicked. ""It's just vegetable and lentil soup. The internet says veggies are good for pregnant women, so I made it for you.""
But the very first time Melody had an allergic reaction and was rushed to the ER after returning to the Rosmere family, it was because of a vegetable soup Elaine had made.
Melody curled up in pain, unable to speak.
Elaine's eyes filled with tears. ""Melody, what's wrong? Please, don't scare me...""
Graham pulled Elaine into his arms, his eyes full of concern. ""Shh, don't cry. It's okay. Don't be afraid.""
Melody barely managed to sit up and reach for the call button. The moment she pressed it, her strength gave out, and she collapsed off the bed, dizzy and disoriented.
Graham quickly pulled Elaine out of the way, making sure she didn't get hurt at all.
Nurses and doctors rushed in, scrambling to treat Melody.
In the chaos, Melody saw Graham holding Elaine, gently patting her back, comforting her.
And in Graham's arms, Elaine looked at Melody with a mocking smile.
Suddenly, Melody realized—her fall into the river might not have been an accident after all.
The seemingly pure and kind Elaine was by no means innocent.
Melody bit her lip so hard she tasted blood.
At last, her symptoms began to ease.
Elaine somehow looked even more pitiful.
""I simmered that soup for three hours. I added vegetables and some lentils. Is there something in it you're allergic to?""
Before Melody could answer, Graham spoke up, ""It's not an allergy. Her blood sugar dropped. It has nothing to do with you.""
""Really?"" Elaine pretended to hesitate. ""How could low blood sugar be that serious?""
""You know her health has always been fragile.""
Melody stared at Graham, suddenly finding it all absurd.
Elaine, with her innocent act, did the cruelest things.
And Graham, afraid Elaine might blame herself, brushed off three years of miscarriages and depression with a simple, ""She has always been fragile.""
""If her blood sugar's low, she should eat more. Melody, have some more soup, okay?"" Elaine offered her the bowl again with a gentle smile.
""You both know it's not my blood sug—""
""Don't waste Elaine's kindness. Olive isn't well, either. You don't want her worrying about you, do you?""
Graham's tone was soft but carried a warning. He took the soup from Elaine and held it out to Melody.
""Drink it. Don't be difficult.""
Chapter 3
Melody felt a chill seep through her whole body as she took the bowl and drank the soup.
When Tyler used to beat her, Olive couldn't stop him—she just did her best to shield Melody with her own body. In Melody's memories, Olive's arms and back were covered in scars that never seemed to heal.
The worst time, Olive clung to her so tightly that Tyler broke six of Olive's ribs with his kicks.
Three years ago, Melody brought Olive home, but their peace lasted only two years before Olive was diagnosed with late-stage stomach cancer.
Back then, Graham had said, ""As long as I'm here, nothing can touch you. Don't be afraid.""
He sat with her as they chose Olive's treatment plan, painstakingly vetted caregivers, and took on the crushing medical bills. Just like he promised, he held up the sky for Melody.
But now, the man using Olive to threaten her was Graham himself.
Her allergy flared up again, her body buckling under the pain. But just as he wished, even as Melody's nails dug bloody crescents into her palms, she didn't make a sound.
""Elaine, you haven't had lunch yet. Let's go get something to eat."" Graham coaxed Elaine out of the room.
Melody knew he just didn't want Elaine to see her having another allergic reaction.
He was always so afraid of upsetting Elaine.
With trembling hands, Melody pressed the call button again and curled up on the bed.
In a daze, her mind drifted back to the day Graham first asked her to be with him.
He was standing in the yard, sunlight pouring over a sea of roses behind him. He reached out a hand. ""Melody, will you be with me?""
She hadn't noticed how tightly he gripped his phone, the veins bulging across his knuckles.
She hadn't noticed the heavy fog in his eyes, not a trace of happiness.
She'd been so naive, believing that after 18 years of hardship, fate was finally being kind to her.
Tears streamed down her cheeks, soaking into her pillow.
The blood-soaked blessing charm slipped from her hand and fell to the floor, kicked aside by the nurses who rushed in.
The next day, Melody was discharged from the hospital.
In the car, Elaine kept her head down, silent.
Graham noticed immediately. ""What's wrong? Not happy?""
""I just feel useless,"" Elaine mumbled, lips trembling. ""I wanted to take care of Melody, but it feels like I didn't help at all.""
""Just being with her is the best care you could give her and the baby.""
Melody slowly rested her hand on her belly, her eyes full of bitter self-mockery.
As soon as they pulled into the driveway, a crowd gathered—Graham's buddies.
Each of them handed Elaine a gift, and her face lit up with delight.
""What's all this? Why are you suddenly giving me presents?
""A limited-edition Labubu—how did you know I wanted this one?
""I've wanted this necklace for ages!
""This music box is gorgeous! I thought it was sold out everywhere!""
Graham's friends teased, ""Elaine, we were sent here to cheer you up. From now on, be good—don't throw any more tantrums.""
Graham chuckled, ""As long as I'm here, Elaine never has to grow up.""
Melody stared at the mountain of gifts, her lips pressed into a thin line.
In three years of marriage, she'd poured herself into every detail of Graham's life.
She made sure his suit was perfectly pressed for work the next day.
She always had his favorite coffee ready while he worked.
Because of his weak stomach, she carried antacids with her everywhere, just in case.
Graham used to laugh and say, ""I'm so lucky to have such a thoughtful wife.""
All that sweetness had turned to poison now.
Only now did Melody realize—being ""thoughtful"" was never a compliment.
It was the one thing the favorite never needed to be.
Elaine was ushered inside like a princess, everyone doting on her, her smile never fading for a second.
They suggested playing games, and every round, Elaine lost.
She had to read a love confession to Graham.
She had to wink at him.
She had to feed him.
And finally, she had to kiss him.
Elaine's cheeks burned red. ""You guys are doing this on purpose, right? I can't be this unlucky!""
""A bet's a bet, Elaine! No backing out!""
""Yeah, rules are rules.""
Right in Melody's own home, in front of her, the supposed lady of the house, everyone openly tried to pair Graham and Elaine together.
Elaine was pushed in front of Graham, looking helplessly at Melody.
""It's just a game,"" Graham said lazily. ""Don't ruin the fun.""
Melody smiled. ""I don't mind.""
Elaine bit her lip, relenting. ""Then I'll just kiss your cheek.""
But as she leaned in, Graham suddenly turned, and her kiss landed on his lips.
The room erupted in cheers and applause.
Melody shot to her feet, unable to watch any longer.
""You guys have fun. I'm going to rest upstairs.""
She had barely reached the stairs when Elaine hurried after her.
""Melody, I didn't mean for that to happen—please don't be angry.""
She sounded anxious, but her lowered voice was full of malice.
""Every time you get pregnant, I stay away from him for a few days. When you miscarry, that's when I bother going to the hospital—he always has to rack his brains to comfort me, terrified I'll be upset.
""Why would I be upset? I'm actually thrilled.
""You'll never have another baby. So tell me—how should I get rid of that last bastard in your belly?""
Elaine suddenly grabbed her wrist.
A cold shock shot straight to Melody's core. In the next instant...
Chapter 4
""Melody... ah!""
Elaine tumbled down the stairs.
Melody froze, her breath caught in her throat. She looked up, only to meet Graham's icy, violent glare—his eyes radiated a murderous intent so cold it felt like he might snap her neck right then and there.
She felt as if she'd fallen into a frozen abyss.
""Graham, I didn't—""
Elaine suddenly cried out in pain. Graham scooped her up and bolted for the door.
""I'm taking you to the hospital right now. Don't be scared, I won't let anything happen to you.""
Melody rushed after him.
She hadn't done it. She wouldn't take the blame!
Outside, a torrential rain was coming down. Melody hurried toward Graham's car.
""Graham—""
The car sped past her, grazing her side. She crashed hard onto the pavement, pain searing through her entire body.
The car roared away, muddy water splattering all over her.
Her vision blurred, then went dark. She heard someone gasp, someone else dialing 911. With a trembling hand pressed to her belly, her consciousness faded away completely.
When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. The heart monitor blared in her ears.
""Has anyone contacted Dr. Cardell? If he's the lead surgeon, there might still be a chance for the baby.""
""No one's reached him. Mr. Dorrick called every doctor in for his girlfriend's consult.""
Melody's whole body ached from blood loss and cold. The despair of losing her child pressed down on her, suffocating.
""Give... give me my phone.""
Her hands shaking, Melody dialed Graham's number.
It connected, but all she heard was Elaine's sobbing.
""Graham, I don't want a scar on my hand.""
""It's just a couple stitches. Dr. Cardell is the best—there won't be a mark,"" Graham soothed, his voice gentle.
A stranger's voice broke in.
""Mr. Dorrick, the ER needs Dr. Cardell immediately. There's a pregnant woman who needs surgery right now.""
""Wait.""
""If you wait, the baby won't make it.""
""Then blame her bad luck. She and that kid were never meant to be.""
That cold, ruthless voice stabbed right through Melody's heart. She started shaking uncontrollably.
On the other end, Graham's tone turned gentle again.
""Be careful—Elaine's afraid of pain.
""Elaine, don't cry. It breaks my heart to see you upset.""
The call cut off.
Tears streamed down Melody's face.
The child she'd hoped for, waited for three years—she still couldn't save it.
Maybe it was for the best. She could never give a child a real family anyway.
""No more waiting... Schedule the abortion... I don't want the baby anymore...""
""... Alright. Sign the consent forms and we'll take you to the OR.""
Melody reached for the pen, her hand trembling as she signed her name, stroke by stroke.
Two sets of consent forms.
One to save her life.
One to give up her child.
As she finished the last signature, it felt as if someone poured alcohol into her wounds—pain burned straight to the bone.
The anesthesia went in, her consciousness slipping away.
Suddenly, Melody asked, ""Will the baby feel pain?""
The doctor paused, silent.
As darkness closed in, her final tear slid down her cheek.
""Graham, oh, Graham...
""If I ever look back on you again in this lifetime, I'll deserve everything I get,"" she thought.
After sleeping for over a day, Melody was finally discharged and sent home.
She had barely stepped out of the cab when she ran straight into Graham.
His furious glare looked like it could carve a hole right through her. ""You pushed Elaine down the stairs, didn't even bother to apologize, and then vanished for a whole day. Elaine was so worried about you, she didn't sleep all night—she only just managed to doze off.""
""I didn't push her. Check the security cameras. I lost contact because your car—""
""Still making excuses? Elaine's been defending you, saying she just missed a step.""
Graham dragged her along. ""Melody, you need to learn your lesson.""
Her already weak body stumbled behind him, vision swimming black.
When they finally stopped, Melody felt chilled to the bone.
He had brought her to Olive's hospital room.
Rip!
Right there beside Olive's hospital bed, he tore her clothes open.
Chapter 5
Before she could even struggle, Graham forced her face down onto the nearby visitor's cot, his palm pressing down hard on the back of her neck—an utterly humiliating position.
""Are you out of your mind?""
Melody's voice came out as a trembling whisper. ""My mom is right here.""
""Perfect. Now she can see exactly how her medical bills are really getting paid."" Graham let out a cold laugh, looking down at her with smug superiority.
He didn't even need to be cruel; just his words alone were enough to grind Melody's last shred of dignity into dust.
Her nails dug so deep into her palms they broke the skin, but she couldn't feel a thing.
As Graham's hand moved higher, her tears began to fall.
""I'm sorry. I was wrong. Please, I'll never do it again.""
He paused, her red, swollen eyes pricking at something inside him.
This was exactly the outcome he'd wanted—so why did he suddenly feel uneasy?
""... Sorry. I lost my temper.""
Graham pulled her into his arms. ""Once the baby's born, Elaine will leave. Then it'll just be you, me, and our child together.""
He said it like it was some kind of favor.
Melody suddenly found it all absurd.
Of course. The woman he truly loved was Elaine. Being with Melody was just a compromise, the consolation prize for lovers who could never be together.
How could it not feel like charity?
His embrace was still warm, but Melody felt cold all the way to her bones.
Graham draped his jacket over her shoulders. ""Come on, I'll go home with you so you can change.""
His phone rang—Elaine.
Graham's voice turned urgent. ""I'll get your bathwater ready, okay? You're already hurt, so please be careful and don't move. I'll be right back.""
He hurried off without so much as a backward glance, not even remembering to bring Melody along.
Melody collapsed to the floor, drained, biting her lip as silent tears streamed down her face.
The only thing she was grateful for was that Olive was still asleep—her health had declined so much that she was barely awake for more than a few hours a day.
After a moment, Melody changed into Olive's clothes and tossed Graham's jacket straight into the trash.
When she got home, Elaine was on a video call with Melody's biological mother, Doris Winlock.
Doris was fussing, her tone exasperated but doting. ""You can't get your stitches wet, understand? If you need anything, have Melody do it for you. If you end up with a scar, you'll be crying your eyes out.""
Elaine spotted Melody and quickly turned the camera toward her.
Doris instantly switched targets. ""Melody, you make the best soup. Make some light broth for Elaine to help her recover. And remember, she always kicks off her blankets at night—check on her so she doesn't catch a chill...""
""I nearly drowned in that river, and wasn't Elaine supposed to be the one taking care of me?""
There was a pause. Doris mumbled, ""But you're fine now, aren't you?""
A sharp pain stabbed through Melody's chest.
She was supposed to be Doris's closest family, but from the moment she returned three years ago, it was like everyone just assumed she'd stolen everything from Elaine.
The one everyone bent over backward to comfort and make whole was always Elaine.
The call ended.
Elaine's voice was soft and fragile. ""Don't take it to heart, okay? Don't listen to Mom—she just worries about me too much.""
Before Melody could reply, Graham came out of the kitchen with a fruit platter, shooting her a warning look as he set it on the coffee table.
Melody lowered her gaze. ""Okay.""
Elaine finally seemed relieved, handing Melody her phone. ""I ordered a bunch of baby stuff—clothes, a crib, a rattle... Look, do you like them?""
Melody stared at the order list, her heart twisting painfully tight.
The baby was gone. Looking at these things was just salt in the wound, a dull knife carving her open.
""As long as you like them,"" Graham said with a smile. ""Whatever you pick, Melody will love too.""
Melody forced a smile. ""He's right.""
Elaine beamed. ""Oh, and have you two thought about a name for the baby? What should we call her?""
""Eloise Dorrick,"" Graham said.
Melody's heart skipped a beat. She looked at him.
Eloise.
He'd chosen a name that sounded just like Elaine's.
For Elaine, he'd killed seven of Melody's children.
The only one he'd ever allowed to live was now just another tribute to his love for Elaine.
""Why..."" Elaine bit her lip, suddenly flustered. ""Why that name?""
Chapter 6
""The name was Melody's idea. What, you don't like it?"" Graham shot back.
""It's beautiful,"" Elaine replied, finally smiling. ""Melody, this baby and I must be fated—she even has a name like mine. Maybe she should call me godmother when she's born?""
Graham nodded to Melody. ""Of course. That would be an honor for the baby.""
Melody clenched her fists, struggling to breathe as the air around her turned icy and thin.
Elaine headed back to her room, leaving Graham alone with Melody at last.
She had a thousand questions she wanted to hurl at him, but in the end, only managed to whisper, ""Graham, what do I even mean to you? What does our child mean to you?""
Graham's brow furrowed. ""I told you I'd be with you. But for the rest of my life, you have to let me keep some memories too.""
""I never insisted on being with you.""
""What are you saying?"" His tone turned sharp, then softened a bit. ""The day after tomorrow is your birthday. I'll throw you a party, make it up to you, alright?""
""No—""
Before she could finish, a crash rang out from Elaine's room. Graham rushed over immediately.
His voice floated back, gentle and full of concern, fussing over Elaine, terrified she might cut herself on the broken glass.
Melody almost laughed. Her trembling hand drifted to her belly.
It was better this way. The baby was gone.
At least the child wouldn't grow up in Elaine's shadow, or become just another one of Graham's reluctant compromises.
Two days later, Graham threw her an extravagant birthday party. He gave her jewelry, a luxury car, fine art, a limited-edition designer bag—he even hired a top-tier band to play all her favorite songs.
Around her, people whispered enviously, as if Melody were the luckiest woman in the world.
But only she knew that, even as Graham stood by her side, his eyes never left Elaine.
The moment Elaine picked up a glass of ice water, Graham was there, swapping it for warm water.
""Did you forget how you cried from cramps last month? No more cold drinks.""
When Elaine reached for a plate of fresh seafood platter, he had it whisked away.
""Your stomach's too sensitive for raw food.""
Elaine pouted, and he offered her a little pudding to cheer her up.
She threw the pudding at him, but he didn't even flinch.
""Elaine, be good.""
Frustrated, Elaine stormed off to the lounge. Graham started to follow, but the birthday cake arrived first.
He frowned, but reluctantly stayed to let Melody make her wish and blow out the candles.
""What did Mrs. Dorrick wish for?"" someone teased.
""She must've wished for a long, happy life with Mr. Dorrick!"" others chimed in, laughing.
Melody shook her head. ""First, I hope Olive recovers soon. Second, I hope Graham and I will always...""
Her voice dropped. ""Always be apart, never see each other again.""
Before she could finish, a sudden cry for help echoed from the lounge.
""Graham... help me... please, no...""
Graham's face went pale as he dashed away. A piercing scream followed.
Melody hurried after him.
Graham was cradling Elaine, who was sobbing uncontrollably. On the floor nearby, a strange man lay covered in blood, his fate uncertain.
Elaine trembled, crying, ""Why would Melody do this to me?""
The more Elaine suffered, the more violent Graham's glare became as he turned to Melody.
A chill ran down her spine. ""It wasn't me, Graham. Just this once, please believe me—""
""Melody, I warned you. Haven't you learned your lesson?"" Graham's voice was cold and deliberate. ""Let me remind you again, if it weren't for Elaine, you'd know exactly what kind of life you'd be living.""
Moments later, the giant screen covered in birthday wishes suddenly switched to a different video.
On it, an 18-year-old Melody, her clothes torn and barely covering her, struggled desperately as she was pinned down and dragged across the floor, humiliated and abused.
The men in the private room leered at her, shouting out bids for who would get to have her first.
""I'll add a hundred.""
""I'll throw in ten bucks, just for a taste.""
A roaring filled Melody's ears. She bit her lip hard and looked at Graham.
She remembered the words he'd whispered, over and over, when he pulled her out of that nightmare.
""It's over.""
""Don't be scared. No one will hurt you again.""
""It's all in the past.""
But now, it was Graham himself who told her that was the life she truly deserved.
Chapter 7
Melody's face was ghostly pale, her body trembling uncontrollably.
Her fragile, broken appearance stabbed straight into the softest part of Graham's heart.
He knew exactly what this video meant to Melody. For a fleeting second, regret flickered in him. But then Elaine's tears soaked through his shirt.
""Graham, I'm scared. Please, take me away from here, okay?""
All his hesitation vanished. Graham scooped Elaine into his arms and left.
Melody needed to learn her lesson, or she'd just keep pushing her limits.
The video cut off right before Graham burst into the room to rescue her, but the looks of disgust and contempt from everyone still pierced Melody like needles.
Suddenly, everything went dark in front of her. Melody looked up—her eyes brightened when she saw Doris.
""Mom...""
Smack!
Doris slapped her hard across the face.
""Melody, you've already stolen everything from Elaine, and now you dare hurt her too?
""I regret it so much—I never should've taken you back!""
Doris turned and stormed off, the Rosmere family close behind.
The room erupted into chaos. The whispers became brazen and cruel.
""Who would've guessed? Turns out Melody's a prostitute—she's slept with how many guys now?""
""Hey, do you think that baby she's carrying is really Mr. Dorrick's?""
""Now that you mention it, she's had seven miscarriages. Maybe it's because the babies weren't even his.""
""She's nothing compared to Elaine.""
Melody's vision went black at the edges. Shame and humiliation crashed over her, threatening to drown her.
Her phone rang. It was the hospital.
""Ms. Melody, your mother bit through her oxygen tube half an hour ago. We did everything we could, but... we couldn't save her.
""I'm sorry for your loss.""
Her fingernails dug into her palms. All she could hear was the roar of blood in her ears.
Her phone buzzed again. A scheduled message from Olive.
""Melody, I don't want to drag you down anymore. Listen to me—leave Graham. Start over.""
Suddenly, Melody remembered that day—Graham pinning her down on the visitor's cot.
""So Mom knew everything all along,"" she thought.
Her breathing grew ragged, pain stabbing through her chest.
With trembling hands, she fumbled through her purse, found her bottle of antidepressants, and shook out two pills.
She swallowed them, but the pain remained.
She poured out three more...
Five.
Ten.
Eventually, the entire bottle spilled onto the floor. Melody coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed.
The room fell silent. Even the onlookers looked away, unable to bear it.
""No matter what, it's still her birthday today.""
Melody laughed—a hollow, wrenching sound that seemed to tear her apart inside.
""Graham, oh Graham... how did I ever fall for you?"" she thought.
In that moment, hating him was almost too easy.
Staggering out of the hotel, Melody made her way to the hospital to handle Olive's final affairs.
According to Olive's last wishes, she scattered the ashes into the sea.
Melody knelt by the ocean all night, lighting candles for Olive. She didn't turn to leave until the last candle flickered out.
But she stopped short. Not far ahead stood Graham.
He hurried toward her, grabbing her freezing hands.
""What are you doing out here alone? I've been looking everywhere for you. You didn't answer your phone.""
She looked at him—he was still in yesterday's clothes, unshaven, with dark circles under his eyes. He looked genuinely worried.
""Melody, Tyler collapsed yesterday. He's in critical condition—liver failure. He needs a transplant to survive. And the only compatible donor is you.""
Of course. Graham had only come for Elaine's sake.
Melody felt cold all over. She tried to pull her hand away, but he held on tight.
""Elaine's been crying nonstop. If I were a match, I wouldn't have come to you.""
The burned money fluttered away on the wind, but Graham was blind—he didn't see, didn't care.
His voice was soft, but there was no room for argument.
""Just donate part of your liver. Think of it as making up for what you did yesterday.""
Chapter 8
Melody snapped her head up, locking her gaze on Graham, eyes burning.
""He's a drunk, a gambler, and an abuser—a complete waste of a man. You know Olive's illness, her failing health, it was all because of him...""
""I know,"" Graham said quietly.
There was a flicker of guilt in his eyes, but he pressed on. ""But he's Elaine's biological father. He's always treated Elaine well.""
In that instant, Melody felt as if she'd been plunged into an icy abyss.
With just a few words, Graham dismissed 18 years of violence and misery that man had inflicted on her and Olive.
Graham wanted her to save the very person who had destroyed Olive's life.
""I won't save him. No one deserves to die more than he does.""
Melody tried to yank her hand free, but he wouldn't let go.
A metallic taste rose in her throat, the pain sharp and overwhelming.
Her vision blurred, and before she knew it, she collapsed. Graham caught her just in time, pulling her into his arms.
Through the haze, she saw Graham's face go ashen with panic as he scooped her up and rushed back inside, calling her name over and over.
He almost looked like he cared.
When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed. Graham was sitting at her side.
Melody tried to sit up, but he pressed her gently back down.
""Don't move. You just had a liver transplant. You need to rest and recover.""
With trembling fingers, she lifted her hospital gown. The gauze covering her surgical wound was stained with small spots of blood.
It felt like a knife had pierced straight through her heart.
Olive was dead.
And she had been forced to save the very man responsible.
The pain was so deep that Melody couldn't even cry.
""They all say I stole everything from Elaine, but I've never understood—what did I ever take from her?""
Graham frowned. ""If it weren't for you, she would have—""
He stopped, suddenly realizing that what Elaine had lost was never truly hers to begin with.
""Graham, what did I do wrong? What gives you all the right to treat me this way?""
Her voice was soft, but it struck him like a blow to the chest.
""I'll make it up to you. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.""
For the first time, a flicker of life returned to Melody's empty eyes. ""Anything at all?""
He nodded. Melody asked for two blank sheets of printer paper and had him sign his name on both.
Graham didn't hesitate—he signed them both.
""I promise I'll never let anyone hurt you again. If you really can't stand Elaine, in a few days, I'll have her move out.""
Melody took the two sheets, lowered her gaze, and said nothing.
Graham pressed his lips together, feeling a strange sense of unease. He was about to say something more when Elaine called.
""Okay, I'll be right there.""
He took a few steps toward the door, then paused, covering the phone's mic. ""Melody, stay in the hospital a few more days and focus on getting better. I'll tell Elaine you're staying with the Rosmere family to rest. I've already let your parents know.
""Elaine doesn't know the liver was yours. She'd feel guilty if she found out.""
At that moment, Melody felt nothing but numbness.
""Fine. I won't go back.""
A strange look flickered across Graham's face, as if he wanted to say more, but Elaine's impatient voice echoed through the phone. He pushed down whatever he was feeling and left.
Melody was too weak to leave, so she stayed in the hospital for three more days.
No one came to visit. The only thing that filled her phone was dozens of messages from Elaine.
The first day, Elaine gushed about how Graham drove three hours just to buy her ravioli.
How he waited on her hand and foot, playing the dutiful son-in-law at her bedside.
The second day, he gave her expensive jewelry to cheer her up.
Both families sat together, chatting and laughing like one big, happy family.
***
The last message read, ""Melody, my dad loves to drink. I'm worried his liver might have more problems. Graham promised me he's already found a stable donor.""
After reading that final message, Melody felt nothing at all.
She didn't even bother with the discharge paperwork—she left the hospital and went straight to the courthouse. Half an hour later, those two sheets of paper, now filled out as divorce agreements, were exchanged for two divorce certificates.
She bought a plane ticket at random. Just as she was about to board, a message from Graham popped up.
""Melody, I'll come by tonight. We can visit Olive together, and I'll pay the rest of her medical bills.""
No need. There was nothing left to pay for.
Melody powered off her phone, snapped her SIM card in half, and tossed it in the trash.
She strode toward the boarding gate without a single glance back.
From that moment on, Graham would never again be a part of her life.
She would do as Olive wished—live well, and start over.

**Meet the half-page spiral notebook, aka: my external prefrontal cortex** (the part of the brain that coordinates executive functioning). 

I currently have 4 used ones floating around my house, a couple shoved into work bags, each with a pen stuck into the spiral. I use them CONSTANTLY. Sticky notes are too small for me. Full page notebooks are too big. Half page is my goldilocks size. I'm an external processor, so even the act of pen to paper for ideas, working out timing for this and that and the other thing, writing down a quick list, etc., goes a LONG way for me in actually executing tasks. Wherever I find one, I grab it. I'll scribble on it right side up, upside down, or even sideways. When I flip through them I find partial crochet charts, number puzzles I was trying to solve, ideas for story lines I might never write, math for recipe adjustments, and lots and lots of check lists. These things save my bacon!! I rip out pages if I need to keep info with me or to remind me at the end of a rehearsal (musician by trade) to send that thing before I leave. Sometimes, I even use them to journal when I just need to process an overwhelming feeling and can't find a proper journal (though i also have multiple journals.) They aren't fancy or nice, so I don't care if they get grease stains or coffee drips, or get beat up. 



Once I was diagnosed, I realized WHY this worked so well for me and told my husband - point blank - that I reserve carte blanche to buy these things absolutely whenever I need to, and that they are to NEVER, EVER be hidden or ""put away."" He knows, from experience, just how big a difference this one thing is for me, so he wholeheartedly agreed! 

Today, I got a whole new STACK of them. It felt good to order so many at once, which I've never done before. It was a small thing, but it was significant to me. I ordered a stack of the thing that may look crazy to some, the thing that doesn't necessarily work for every ADHD brain, but works for *my* brain and helps *me* show up for life as a better functioning person. **For me, this is an important part of what managing my ADHD looks like, and a tool I fought hard to find.

So I went down a rabbit hole. Learned about green bean sourcing, the Swiss Water Process, how to roast decaf properly (it’s trickier than you’d think), and eventually started my own thing. Our roaster has totally geeked out about it too.  

Not here to sell anyone - I know Reddit has a pretty strong nose for BS. Just happy to share what I’ve learned, answer questions about how decaf works behind the scenes, or hear about other people's favorite decafs. If you’ve tried Big Bad and have feedback - positive or brutal - I’m all ears.

I think good decaf deserves way more respect, and I’m here for the people who agree.

That was all the info I had when I got in the car until a resident got in touch with me. Bless him and his kindness and patience, and his ,”Wait, you must work in healthcare?” as I asked a few questions. 🤣

I thought I’d be at least a tiny bit prepared to see my own child on a vent after my years in the unit. I was wrong. 

The nurses, docs, secretaries, literally everyone on that unit took care of me like I was one of their own. I asked for nothing, but was never without water, coffee, or snacks. Preferred pronouns were used, something my kid doesn’t stress over but means the world to them.

Kiddo is fine now. No prolonged downtime thanks to their partner waking up at an unexpected time, getting the help and support they need. 

Just wanted to say thank you for the small acts of kindness you show patients and their loved ones each day, the extra moment or two. It stacks up and makes a difference. It did for me when I was on the other side. ",37,1755195802.0,IntensiveCare,4,0.95,False

1mq8oj9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mq8oj9,Had a nice bokashi tea harvest today...getting it into the acidic PH zone...,"Still feeding [my DIY vegetable scraps bokashi](https://www.reddit.com/r/bokashi/comments/1m7ou2e/showing_my_cheap_diy_bokashi_system_woth_some/) almost daily. Today the leachate crossed the PH 4 mark. It was like the 4th or 5th harvest - the first two were above five, stinking, down the drain. Then came two batches of like 4.3, already smelling sour like sour fermented veggies, all of a sudden. They already worked well as fertilizer, but I believe they started stinking already or will soon, due to the heat, and have to go down the drain, as well.

I edited the Photo so you can read the display of the PH meter a little better it was a bright sunny day here...now I'm with stable PH 3.9. This is good acidic tea, proper for usage... I believe it can go down as low as 3.8, but around there is the barrier for lactic acid. I make this bokashi only from raw veggie scraps from cooking veggies daily, maybe with some tea and coffee and some herbs and things like this, and bread drink (kwass, I use ""Kanne Brottrunk"") as inoculant, 50ml/l diluted tap water, sprayed over each layer of veggies until it's slightly dripping wet on the outside all over the bucket.

I believe below PH 4 or somewhere around is the magical point for this system. The Tea is then so acidic, that it would hardly spoil any more. I kept bottles in a dry room temp place for a year, still good fertilizer, smells like fresh. Some admittedly smelt a little alcoholic or even fizzed when opening...but still worked great. So I am now storing these bottles and using the other until it's bad. I hope they won't turn bad any soon.

The harvest today was 1.5 liters of leachate. I just put it in fresh bottles, if it's clean and acidic enough, it will not spoil even in a used bottle, even one with bokashi tea in it, even when there were traces of spoiled one. I mean it's better to disinfect the bottles (I find a dental prothesis cleaner tab and warm water already can kick it at times), but the tea itself is pretty robust by it's own acidic powers. It really only seems to spoil if the PH is too high, or when it's only small traces of it that have too much air contact. When it spoils, you'll immediately know - it's stink, like feces but worse, or even like some weird synthetic mayhem making you choke immediately. When good, it just smells like pickles and strong cheese to me...

I store it in green lemon juice bottles which I use for cooking and in smoothies to start the day every day. The important point is they need a cap with an overpressure point. This is bottles with caps like mason jars, that have a click button that will go inside when cooking down jam etc. in them. This is because the bokashi tea is bio-active and will produce gas, and it may blow up any bottle that is sealed too tight. The click cap bottles and mason jars and similar storage devices have this pressure protection and will allow the gas to evaporate from the inside. So also keep them stored upright, don't store them lying or even upside down, it will press the tea through the cap.

I get a harvest like this every 2-3 days now, this is like almost one 0.75 bottle per day. I cannot use so much fertilizer, but I plan trying to find people around the place where I live, who want to use it, so I don't have to let it spoil or throw it away. You only have to use so little of it, that you either need a big garden, or you'll have too much of it when recycling a lot of vegetables.

It's a good fertilizer - my bokashi has no meat or dairy in it, only raw veggies, they contain very much water and fresh enzymes that produce so much tea! Also I add loads of ginger peels and garlic scraps, so diluted it is not only a good fertilizer (1-5ml/l watering once per week, maybe up to 10 or even 20 for extremely hungry plants), but also a good pest control substance (also like 10ml/l then foliar spray, can kill/repel some bugs but als smell a little...).

Have a happy composting, friends, and don't forget to use the tea for your plants if you make some good one. It's real good for the plants, I can grow real healthy ones with it, generating more veggie scraps to feed back to my buckets every day. Don't just throw it away, if you don't use it, you'll maybe know some friends who love plants and don't fear that little nasty sour...smell in the nose...",1,1755195632.0,bokashi,0,1.0,False

I (F23) have been with my girlfriend (F22) for 4 years and we’ve been living together for 3 (we were best friends in high school so we moved to college together in another country)

Ever since we started dating her parents seemed off. They never openly hated on me or on us as a couple at first but they did things that subtly would tell more than words.

For example they would refer to me as “her friend”, or they would joke about how my gf should “ask for that nice gentleman’s number”. I didn’t really like it but it was not a big deal.

Slowly things started to change. They didn’t let her go to my mom’s wedding for some reason but on the same night she was allowed to go out with a friend to a disco party.

Then it got even worse when we decided to move to college together, for context she was determined to go to a specific college in a specific city and I adapted and chose something in the same city as her, so nothing really changed for her except from the fact I was with her?
But for some reason her dad was furious about that.

He was also furious when I found ourselves a house that was basically perfect, in the city center, very cheap and pretty. He didn’t let us go live there and instead made us go one whole week homeless because he wanted to be the one to find the house under his conditions.

They also said multiple times that they were only looking to find a place for their daughter and not for me, if there was space then I would go as well otherwise I would have to figure it out.

Then when we did find a house they wouldn’t make me go to class and would let me stay home with them to clean and buy stuff for the house, while her daughter never missed a day.

You might think things got better once we moved to a different city? You’d be wrong because they kept making this harsh unprovoked comments. For example once I was wearing my gf’s pajamas, her dad saw me on facetime and he started yelling at me because I “stole it” from her. Or when her mom packed us biscuits and sent it by mail and her dad kept saying to my gf “that’s for YOU not her”

They yelled a me once because there was a drop of coffee on the table and said “do you not know how to clean???”

Then a few months ago they came to our doorstep trying to take their daughter away because they thought she “finished all her exams” when 1. she had one left 2. she didn’t want to go to their place anyways and 3. I would had to stay alone in another country for a whole month and a half if she actually left

Now what happened today you may ask. It was her mother’s birthday. For reference every time there’s a birthday or any celebration my family always invite my girlfriend, it’s implied that whatever happens she’s supposed to be there and party with us.

Today I didn’t get invited to her mom’s birthday, but you know who did? A random friend of my gf’s sister.

I completely lost it and had a huge fight with my girlfriend and her sister where at the end of it I stated that I would never step foot into that house ever again.

They said to me that it was not a big deal and I agree, if it was JUST that it wouldn’t have been a big deal. But this is much more than that. They also said that with my decision I was being petty and punishing my gf more than them.

1mq8m2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mq8m2c/new_age_mormons/,New Age Mormons,"It seems like there’s a growing trend among younger members to pick and choose which church policies they follow. I’ve heard things like, “Wearing garments is between Heavenly Father and me” or “I don’t think coffee is that bad, so I drink it and I’m still temple-worthy.”

What I find interesting is that this often comes from people who also defend church history and claim to fully sustain the prophet. Yet, at the same time, they’ll openly set aside teachings or counsel from that same prophet to match their personal lifestyle.

Why do you think this shift is happening? Is it just a cultural change, a personal spirituality movement, or something else? Why follow a religion that your clearly not following its policy and path to exaltation. ",19,1755195483.0,exmormon,12,0.96,False
1mq8lmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1mq8lmf/side_effect_not_from_ozempic/,Side effect not from Ozempic!,"So i started my Ozempic journey back in March.  At the same time I was also prescribed atorvastatin for cholesterol (and I take something for my blood pressure but have been on that for a while)While my side effects have never been eztreme, I mostly complain about being constipated but have also had the bouts of Nausea and food smell aversion. I've always just assumed it was the Ozempic. 

Well, was away for 5 days and somehow managed to forget to bring the Atorvastatin. I googled it and while it says you shouldn't stop the medication cold turkey I also knew I wasn't doing that much harm. 2 days after not taking it was feeling great. even my coffee aversion was gone but i hadnt made the connection yet.

Get home, take it again, was still fine the next day...2nd day back on it, today...I FEEL SO GROSS! I  couldn't drink my morning coffee, I've been nauseous all day. All I want to do is go lie down but im stuck at work for 5 more hours. Ugh!

So now I'm pretty convinced it's the atorvastatin giving me the issue and not the Ozempic. I've called in to see my doctor but she can't see me until Aug 25th. 

Not sure if I'll want to continue taking it from now until then.

Anyways,point of my long story is,if you're on other medications, it may not be the Ozempic causing you problems!!",3,1755195457.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

**Animal Communication**  
Birds stop chirping when I walk past. Stray cats follow me to the gym for protection.

**Reality Manipulation**  
Traffic lights turn green as soon as I approach them. Elevators are always waiting on my floor.

**Unstoppable Aura**  
The air feels thicker when I enter a room. People keep moving out of my way without making eye contact.

**Electromagnetic Dominance**  
My microwave won’t start unless I nod at it. My TV changes channels before I press the remote.

**Time Control**  
I clapped my hands in the kitchen yesterday and my coffee was already brewed.

**Universal Recognition**  
An old man on the bus called me “my king” without explanation.

I’m honestly scared to keep going. If this is Day 90, I don’t even want to imagine what Day 365 will be like.

1mq8ju0,https://i.redd.it/a9tuh00u01jf1.jpeg,We were tired of news bias and Political Narratives. So we built Relative News.,"A couple of friends and I recently built our first app together - Relative News.

The app delivers news from multiple reputable sources, side by side, so readers can see the full picture without the filter bubble.

Instead of bombarding you with endless headlines, Relative groups related articles from multiple sources into ""Stories."" This way, you can easily follow a topic and see how different outlets are reporting on it. By presenting multiple perspectives side by side, we aim to reduce bias and help users form a more balanced understanding of the news.

Relative doesn’t use your personal data to customize your feed - instead, it shows a clean scrollable feed of top stories from across the spectrum, so you can compare coverage and form your own opinions. With our latest update, you can sort news by categories and find what matters to you.

We would sincerely appreciate you trying our app and letting us know what you think. USA and ios17+ only for now!
