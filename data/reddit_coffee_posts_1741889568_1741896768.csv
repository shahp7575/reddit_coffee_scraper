1jalb5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jalb5x/aitah_for_blocking_this_guy_with_weird_behaviour/,Aitah for blocking this guy with weird behaviour I couldn't understand,"Never thought I'd be posting here but here I am 
I'm actually pretty confident of what I did (I feel like I dodged a big, venomous, bullet) but I'm telling this story to confront myself with your knowledge and your experiences.   

So weeks ago I was on a vacation, far from where I live. I stayed in an Airbnb. I met this guy the last day when just the morning I was going to leave (I'm 20, he was 53). He offers me to go to a cafè together to have breakfast. 
Guys, hear my out, we started talking like he was my best friend since ever. You know when you feel that deep connection with someone? It was like that. He felt like the father I never had. The things he said were interesting: I had an ucrainian ex-wife, so the last years were though he said. He was a translator, talking lots of different language (dutch, he said he was dutch, english, french, russian, spanish, italian he was also learning my language. I only heard him talk english and russian I think it was). 
He was into zen because of some very spiritual friend he had. I told him I was into meditation, self-awareness. 
I had to go to a place that morning, he insisted to pay me the breakfast (because I was a studend) and to come with me so we could talk together a bit more, using all the time we had. 

During this, I mentioned my family struggles, the lack of connection I've felt my whole life because of it. 

By the time we arrive to the place I needed to be I want to give me a ""buddhist hug"" so we could ""feel our hearts"". It lasted for seconds and I was uncomfortable in it, I'm not used to physical affection at all. I then told him this per message 

We exchange our phone numbers, he had two: one for work, one for usual life

He istantly starts sending things. He was happy for meeting me, he hoped we could meet again, our meeting was a gift from the universe. 

He mention again (as he did in person) that he organizes this special birthday where I takes together ""important people"" for him, his closest friends, people he felt a deep connection with. I was one of them.   

I sent me a video of these guys doing music with drums and guitars. Simple things.  

He offers to pay me the trip (a couple of days), he search for the right plane to take, he sends me the place I would stay if I went (another airbnb of his). It was strange he sent me these things on the sale exact day we meet, as if everything was already organized.  

I start to become more and more cold in those conversation during the days, as a way to make him understand that, to me, he was exaggerating with the being open, warm, friendly (I know I could just tell him, but I'm still struggling with showing real openness to people)   

I then talked to two friends of mine about this, one told me ""You were be in danger with him"", the other ""what a beautiful person you met"". I then talked to my therapist, who said (to sum up) ""hard to say, he surely broke the rules of proxemics with that hug"" (which means he basically entered my private space without asking that much)

He already mentioned about don't minding me to sleep to his place when he would come back in my city (what's the point of that, It's my city, I literally live here). Today, he did it again: he wanted to know where my house was so he could take an airbnb near it so we could stay the most time together. I then mentioned, after talking to my therapist, what I would have liked more: ""let's meet for a coffee in the afternoon, these days exams are close, I need to study"" (which wasn't true)

He answered that he needed to go to the center of the city by car, so he would prefer to avoid the daytime ""but if I let him no other choices...""

Something in the tone of the message scared me off. I wrote him ""I understand"" and blocked him, felt much relieved

That's it

1jal7yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jal7yd/three_months_on_ageless_multicollagen_heres_what/,Three Months on Ageless Multi-Collagen – Here’s What Changed (and What Didn’t),"I have been skeptical about collagen supplements for a long time. There are so many products on the market promising younger skin, stronger hair and nails, and better joint health, but the actual results can be hit or miss. After doing some research, I decided to try **Ageless Multi-Collagen** for 90 days and see if it actually made a difference.

Here’s what happened, what I liked, what I didn’t, and whether I think it’s worth using long-term.

# Why I Chose Ageless Multi-Collagen

I have tried a few collagen powders in the past, but most of them had problems. Some had a strong taste, some didn’t dissolve well, and others only contained one or two types of collagen. Since I was looking for something that could benefit **skin, hair, nails, joints, and digestion**, I wanted a supplement that provided a full spectrum of collagen types.

Ageless Multi-Collagen stood out for a few reasons:

* It contains **five types of collagen** from **four natural sources** (grass-fed beef, cage-free chicken, wild-caught fish, and eggshell membrane).
* It is **flavorless and odorless**, which means it can be mixed into drinks without affecting the taste.
* It claims to support **skin elasticity, hair growth, nail strength, joint function, and gut health**.
* It is **non-GMO, gluten-free, and lab-tested for quality and purity**.

I ordered the [**Buy 2, Get 1 Free deal**](https://getagelesscollagen.com/offer-01/?lpid=0994&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=994&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=994&device_type=&country_name=&oid=994&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=%20%20r/HealthProductsNatural) to give it a fair trial.

# First Impressions

Mixability was the first thing I tested. I tried adding it to coffee, smoothies, and even plain water. It dissolved completely with no clumping, which was a good start. Some brands claim to be tasteless but still have a noticeable flavor, so I was relieved that this one was truly neutral.

The first few weeks, I did not notice any dramatic changes. Collagen is something that builds up over time, so I expected this to take at least a month before seeing any real effects.

# Skin and Hair Changes

By the **fifth or sixth week**, I started noticing that my skin was **less dry**, especially in the mornings. My moisturizer seemed to absorb better, and my face looked more hydrated. The fine lines on my forehead were still there, but overall, my skin looked healthier.

The biggest difference was in my **hair strength**. I usually have a lot of hair shedding when I brush or wash it, but by the **seventh or eighth week**, there was significantly less fallout. My hair also felt stronger and less prone to breakage.

# Nail Growth and Strength

Around the **six-week mark**, my nails started to feel **less brittle**. They grew faster than usual and stopped breaking as easily. This was one of the more noticeable changes, and it was consistent throughout the entire three months.

# Joint and Bone Support

I do not have severe joint pain, but I sometimes experience **knee stiffness**, especially after long days of standing or sitting in one position for too long. It was around **week ten** that I realized my knees felt **less stiff in the mornings**. The improvement was not dramatic, but it was enough to make a difference in how I felt throughout the day.

# Digestive Health

This was one area I did not expect to see much change, but I actually noticed some improvements in digestion. By the second month, I felt **less bloated after meals**, and my stomach seemed to process food more efficiently. I did not change anything else in my diet, so I assume this was related to the collagen.

# What I Liked

* It **mixed easily** into any drink without changing the taste or texture.
* It provided **noticeable improvements in skin hydration, hair strength, and nail growth**.
* It helped with **minor joint stiffness**, especially in the mornings.
* It seemed to support **digestion and gut health**, which was unexpected.

# What I Didn’t Like

Ageless Multi-Collagen is not a miracle product, but it does **deliver real benefits over time**. It helped with **skin hydration, hair and nail strength, joint stiffness, and digestion**, but the effects were gradual. If you are looking for an immediate difference, this probably is not for you.

For anyone willing to **commit to daily use for at least two to three months**, this is a high-quality multi-collagen supplement that covers **a broad range of health benefits**. It is one of the **best-mixing and truly flavorless** collagens I have tried, making it easy to incorporate into a daily routine.

If you have used Ageless Multi-Collagen or another brand, I would be interested to hear what your experience was like. Did you notice any benefits, or was it underwhelming?",1,1741896090.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

1jal4l4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jal4l4,Torr wgah’nagl fhtagn Part 3,"    Ontokinesis. Popularly referred to as reality bending. The throttling of real-space; the defiance of transactional law. An elusive power exclusively, perhaps intrinsically tied to this universe; the stranger sister of thaumaturgy. What is it? How does it work? Looking into the questions that science-

Eva Torr skipped past the advertisement. She’d already watched enough of the show that was being marketed towards her to know it was shit. More focused on entertainment and mystery than knowledge and practicality. Hell, Eva was pretty sure they were borrowing from pseudoscience half the time.

Eva sighed, and looked to her Lilian in the crib. She looked pretty in her little white outfit, her face round with baby fat, her hands by her side. She was three months old now and already seemed to take after her mother.

Well. When she did take after her mother.

Magenta eyes stared blissfully at distressed sea-blue, unaware, unassuming. Mother’s eyes looked back, the alien hue still failing to leave her daughter’s eyes, still failing to show Eva that blueness that belonged.

Eva thought back to the pillbox in the kitchen. She took her medications today, the stress she felt wasn’t postpartum depression. She was just regular-tired of this crap.

She wished Lilian could just be a normal baby.

.

.

The third day after Lilian Torr was sent off from the hospital she was born in was the day that she was taken back to the hospital. Lilian had, strangely, not been demanding of food and water, but she had still slept and ate and drank what was given, so her parents didn’t question it. What they did question was when she accidentally phased her left leg an inch into the wooden floor, where she found herself stuck for an awkward, panicking minute.

Due to Lilian’s very logical decision to start crying over being eternally trapped in the woodwork, Eva was very quick to try to pull the child up and rescue her, obviously-broken physics be damned. As she tried, her hands phased through Lilian like a hologram. Then Eva felt a sharp pain in her head as baby Lilian disappeared from reality entirely.

Eva immediately searched for her daughter, looking at the ground before finding her baby in its crib. When she looked, she hallucinated over the child a miniature figure of ash, staring back at her with magenta eyes. Then she saw Lilian again.

.

The hospital exorcist sighed as his phone recognized the number that called him. Recognizing phone numbers meant that he probably didn’t finish his job well enough on a particular client and he was about to get sued, or maybe he did and the client was stupid enough to A: waste his time on thankfulness or B: Actually get repossessed.

Well, at least in the last case he’d be getting paid a bit more this week. That was nice, the exorcist supposed.

A textbot summarized the call. “Client: Eva Torr. Calling on behalf of daughter Lilian Torr. Subject has been noted to exhibit anomalous behaviors post-recovery from deadly mutation.”

Without much consideration, the exorcist said, “Sounds like it might be canalization of the initial mutation into a less severe form. Tell her I’ll look into it, and we can see about fully removing the stigmata for a few fees.”

An inquiry came to the exorcist, so he paused for a few seconds to allow the textbot to finish its recording subroutine. “…Textbot, is this the same client as last time?” A digital affirmation made the exorcist sigh. And here he was hoping that he’d have half a wit about this.

.

The hospital exorcist opened the soul-scan machine and walked to the coffee machine as he waited for it to load. It should, in a test-negative infant patient, show a baby-shaped bundle of red mana surrounding and slightly permeating a blue wiry interior mana on a green background. Oddities in this design would suggest mutation or possession by Astral entities.

The exorcist wasn’t expecting Lilian’s report to be normal. Not at all. But by how he abruptly stopped sipping his iced coffee as Lilian’s report fully loaded onto the screen, he also underprepared himself. He swallowed his drink.

“…What am I looking at?”

Her soul was wrong. Fucked up, like a half-baked doll made by an alien that thinks you’re supposed to bake dolls. …Not opaque enough. The physical mana-aspects incredibly weak, barely any mana attached. Explains how the baby fell through the floor, but why is so it weak? Is that just how little she’s recovered from after the Howling?

Lilian’s soul was hollow inside, indicated by the universal-background-green within— That’s how the exorcist knew she’d have some sort of ontokinesis—, but too hollow. It wasn’t a normal hollowness, either, it was asymmetric, sharp and flowing. It grew and shrank and broke erratically, but with an almost mathematical rhythm.

And then there was the magenta around the green hollow. It was like a… bizarre cluster-replacement of the type blue markers, exotic sorts of high-purity mana shoved in place of the element of sapience. The scanner zoomed in on its inner edges, and then began to lag as it tried to tag oddities it found. After a second the exorcist shut the AI textbot off and started looked manually.

A uncountable amount of threads of magenta formed and collapsed every millisecond, breaking against each other, fizzling into nothingness, forming *from* nothingness. It swirled in geometric patterns throughout the hollow, clashing with it, stretching through it, disappearing and reappearing on a whim.

It was like an… incursive simulation of the outside? Or maybe the *exterior* was a projection of whatever the fuck was going on here.

Huh.

…Eh, whatever. He’ll just tell the parents that he can’t really help except by recommending them keep Lilian away from organic matter for a week and then follow standard practices for raising an ontokinetic. Thank God the CAC is not in jurisdiction on this planet, otherwise he’d have to fork over a 17-paragraph essay and images and crud.

*No wait,* do *not* thank God, the exorcist absolutely does *not* need his acknowledgement more than he already borrows in Tartarian purgation spells.

Anyways. The exorcist turned off the scanner, removed the sleepy Lilian from the scan-site, and moved her to a stroller. The images he saw buried themselves a spot in his long-term memory as he pushed the baby through the hospital.",1,1741895862.0,Fleetposting,3,1.0,False
1jal3dv,https://i.redd.it/w8woyrmgiioe1.jpeg,Deep 27 vs. v60 (Finca Deborah Vivid),"Been brewing the Finca Deborah vivid and just wanted to share experiences across brewers. 

Ground w/ Pietro Pro at 7.1 for both. For v60, brewed at 94C w/ a 45s bloom and 5 pours (15g to 250 mL). 

For deep, did 98C with a 13g dose with 45s bloom and pulsed pours to a 1:17 ratio. 

Brewed again with deep at 100C with an 8g dose with a 1:16 ratio. 

v60 was my favorite consistently with a more robust body. The 1:17 was not astringent at all and displayed the same flavor profile as the v60, but it just felt lighter (possibly due to the increased ratio), so I lowered the ratio on the last brew and increased temp due to lower water volume for extraction. Ended up a bit over extracted and astringent, and I preferred the taste of the 1:17. Will keep working on the deep for the ends of bags, but let me know if anyone has had more success with it. I hear bypass can be significant, so I’m trying not to pour too much at a time. 

(The coffee was awesome by the way. Very clear presentation of florals and acidity. The washed finish is very noticeable and makes it more approachable to me. I’m currently drinking Symmetry, which is the same coffee but without the washed finish, and it has those booze adjacent natural notes, but also more complexity than Vivid in my opinion).",2,1741895777.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

—-

so, for context, i’m 22 and i’ve admitted from the age of 16 that vegans are correct, morally speaking. for the longest time the thing holding me back was fairly severe executive disfunction and depression, the fact that my parents made nearly all the food i ate, ordering food instead of making it myself, and a deep dislike towards flavors of more traditional plant-based meals that are served at restaurants (cold salads, more acidic flavors, uncooked greens, cooked carrots, general autistic pickiness about preparation and specific ingredients.)

on top of that, i’m texan. not much of a plant-based culture here to be found outside of certain parts of bigger cities.

from ages 17-21 i was stuck in active addiction and unable to accept that i have substance abuse disorder, its kind of hard to stick to a moral code when the only thing you can think of all the time is getting high and, depending on the substance, binge eating, in fact the act of getting high sedates any sort of negative feelings or inhibitions one might have. i’ve been stuck in disfunction for a long time. but i recently got sober! :D

the more i come into properly living my life and consciously controlling what i eat, the more interest i’ve had in cooking. i was never bad at it, but its such an intense task to manage with my variety of dopamine-deficit and easily overwhelmed mental conditions (which i’m working on, mind you!) the task right now is making cooking a truly enjoyable hobby.

and the more interest i have in cooking, the more i start making up my own dishes.

and the more i make up my own dishes, the more i realize that i naturally have a HEAVY leaning towards anti-meat or non animal related foods.

i love rice, various grains, lotus root, celery, onion, COUNTLESS different greens, starches, nuts, etc... milk/cream were incredibly easy to stop buying, i never really liked the taste of coffee and feel kinda eh about chocolate (INSANELY ethically worrisome, very hard to ensure ethical working conditions.) never liked eggs to begin with. fish was pretty good but i only ever craved it when i was low on protein, and its too much work to cook. in fact ANY meat is too much work to cook. and sort of horrifying as far as my contamination OCD goes. if i even *think* about touching raw meat i get nauseous and terrified, it literally scares me less to see a bloody open wound than it does to see dead meat.

its to the point where i don’t even think about buying meat or animal products whenever i cook for myself, which is sort of shocking to me given that my entire upbringing i was sort of fine with it. never liked it when my parents made it but some restaurants made it taste good. but then i realized looking back that it was just the spices/oils that i really craved.

so once again i’m thinking about how, naturally from the progressive perspective i’ve held my entire life, vegans are morally correct. meat is not sustainable, not ethical, animals clearly feel things and deserve to be happy just as much as anything that has emotions, etc etc etc…

the more i actually interact with cooking and lower the sharp mental divide thats experienced when someone gives you a fully cooked, socially normalized meat dish that you don’t have to touch or think about like when you actually prepare it yourself, the more visceral that moral and physical disgust becomes.

the only thing thats keeping me from FULLY making the transition now is that i don’t really know what foods to go for to fill certain nutrient gaps, especially given that i have a crazy fast metabolism and already struggle to get high enough calories on a daily basis given my low food drive (however, withdrawals taught me that i can function very well on starvation calories, went climbing after only eating like 100 cals that day and felt fine.)

is there anyone else who struggles with executive dysfunction and has successfully held a vegan diet for a considerable amount of time? and i mean the level of executive dysfunction that will make me starve for a full day if cooking feels like too much work or too overwhelming and i don’t have enough money to order out. any tips for this? staple snacks that can fill the place of a proper meal if need be?",3,1741895457.0,vegan,12,0.8,False

Well, my plans have been seriously changed due to low milk supply and high demand from the baby. The first week and half to two weeks he wasn't gaining weight by only breast-feeding so we had to start supplementing with formula. I totally understand fed baby is best but it makes me really sad that my body isn't doing what I expected, especially since my last daughter breastfed so easily & my supply was fine.

I started seeing lactation consultants and they recommended triple feeding for the last week. On top of that I bought lactation cookies, I've been taking liquid gold and yes, making sure that my water intake is a lot- at least 100 ounces per day, not drinking soda and limiting myself to half cup of coffee in the am. 

I went back to the lactation consultant today to see the improvement in the last week. He did get almost 2 ounces of milk from me, which is an improvement from last week where he didn't even get an ounce. But he's still not getting enough so I still have to keep supplementing with formula.

I feel like there isn't enough suggestions or ideas on how to get my milk supply up it's just you're not making enough and the baby needs to be fed so give them formula. 

I read about power pumping somewhere so I'm gonna try that at least once a day hopefully that will help. But they said if I can't make enough an improvement next week that we're gonna have to have a ""long-term plan"" - not sure what that means.

I'm just sad and no one around me really gets it. Yeah they have words of encouragement like you're doing great, keep it up, you're doing everything you can! Then I have my husband telling me that I need to eat more food & drink more water. I'm already eating breakfast lunch and dinner and having a fruit for snack in between the meals like an apple with peanut butter or a cup of yogurt. I literally cannot eat more food than I am eating.

Typically during a hot shower your body will deliver vasolidation. But once you exit the shower the ANS delivers Vassoconstriction. That’s not the problem, the problem is the body has an issue of returning to homeostasis. It’s a prolonged vasoconstriction. Brain fog, and fatigue are my biggest complaints. The brain is not getting the blood supply it needs. Cold showers will have a more immediate negative effect. Cold showers cause vasoconstriction. Lifting weights which I do, does the same. If you over expert yourself, vasoconstriction once again. Coffee, vasoconstriction as well. These are my triggers along with carb heavy meals. 

My solution that has worked somewhat well has been to limit coffee, limit heavy lifting, and go lighter and not to muscle fail. Eating smaller meals with less carbs. Lukewarm showers but try to avoid showering in the morning. Nights are better. Most importantly it has been to take a vasolidator. I’m using oral minoxidil. Along with electrolytes and water and Niacin flush; also a vasodilator. I have a co occurring immune issue with gluten, and histamine which was confirmed through an allergy test. I monitor my blood pressure though out the day. I’m 44 m. I’ve been dealing with this my whole life and never figured out what it was. My labs are all excellent. My quality of life has been terrible.

(I’m vegetarian),"So I (29f) have been seeing a girl (30f) for a couple of months now, she’s really great, we have so much in common and I like her a lot. I’m vegetarian and have been for almost 10 years now, I’m not one of those preachy veggies, I don’t care what other people do, but I just personally prefer not to! The girl I’m seeing eats meat and I have no issue with that, I even sometimes cook meat for her separately when making us food, because she’s super into fitness and cares about her protein intake. Again, I have no issue with this, I used to cook and eat meat when I was younger so it really doesn’t bother me. She knows I’m vegetarian and up til now I didn’t think it was a problem. 

Now on to the AITA situation, so last weekend we were having breakfast together, I made myself a veggie sausage sandwich and a meat version for her. Immediately after finishing her last bite (and I literally mean, she had _just_ swallowed her last mouthful) she said ‘thanks for making breakfast babe’ and leaned in to kiss me. I could still see food in her teeth and her lips were greasy so I leaned back a bit and playfully said ‘haha hang on, maybe take a drink first? Sorry, I don’t want to get your meaty breakfast all over my lil veggie face!’ 

She looked at me disgusted and asked if I was serious, I was kind of shocked, I was serious, but I was trying to be lighthearted about it and honestly didn’t think it was an unreasonable request. I wasn’t asking her to go brush her teeth or anything, I just thought maybe a quick sip of her coffee might wash away any food particles in her mouth, I would have been more than happy to kiss her after just one small sip. 

But after that she was in a mood with me the rest of the day, she barely spoke to me, wouldn’t cuddle me and eventually I went home. The next time I saw her she told me that I was trying to set a ridiculous boundary and that I was out of line and made her feel disgusting, she said if I was going to continue to police what she eats then she’s not sure we’ll work out. I was never trying to police what she eats, I cooked her the meat myself!!

(For context, I’m a Food Technology teacher in Aus. I know about nutrition and eating a balanced diet, I know how to cook, I know pp your nutrition needs change. And through pregnancy I didn’t really exercise because of morning sickness/other issues. I’m also 5 months pp)

So I’ve had to have some regular blood tests since giving birth for various reasons but the last one has come back saying my fat/lipid levels are too high so I need to lose weight. I hate BMI because it doesn’t provide a full picture but the doctor used it and based on that, I’m obese. That scared me tbh. 

Anyway, it’s been about a month and nothing has budged. I’m in a calorie deficit (even if I didn’t exercise), having more lean protein to keep me fuller for longer, upped fibre and veg, I’m walking 10K or more steps a day, I’m trying to weight train 3x a week but that depends if baby boy lets me. I’m eating fresh foods, rarely touching processed, haven’t snacked in a month so no chocolate/cookies etc. haven’t had takeaway in about a month too. I’ve switched to skim milk for my coffee/tea and am trying to prioritise water but sometimes I just need a Pepsi max. I’m also tracking my food on my fitness pal but I’m really cautious of that because I think in the past I developed a bit of an ED and obsession with it. 

NOTHING HAS BUDGED! WHY!? I don’t even care if it was 500g, it doesn’t need to be much but literally nothing has moved. I’ve also measured my waist and that dropped 0.5 cm last week but went back up this week. I’m so frustrated because nothing is working. I know weight fluctuates everyday so I’m only weighing myself once a week but still! It could very well be that my period is due soon so that’s why nothing budged this week but what about the weeks before? 

I’m trying to be gentle on myself because my body has gone through a lot and what I’m doing is just living a healthy lifestyle but it’s just frustrating. I want to be a healthy mum for my boy and feel better about myself. Don’t care if I never fit my pp clothes but just want to be healthier and more active for him as he grows up. 

I’m also scared about this because these high lipid levels could lead to further problems and I don’t want to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease etc. it’s just so annoying that I’m significantly more active than I was a month ago, or even a year ago, eating so much better than I even did through pregnancy and nothing has changed. 

Any tips, advice, solidarity is welcome. But also just needed to get that off my chest. ",1,1741895008.0,Mommit,1,1.0,False

I actually first bought the normal khamrah. When i first got it, the projection and sweetness felt weaker than i thought it would be, since everyone was saying how strong it was. Scent wise, it smelt really nice and addicting with that cinnamon, vanilla boozy smell. 

I did some searching and a few people others also said their khamrah was weak too, so i returned mine, thinking it was a bad batch or even a fake. 

I then picked up khamrah qahwa. And honestly, its like 90% similar to the qahwa in my opinion. It feels like i get a whiff of the coffee once in a while, but when i do it is pretty good. The strength however was same as the khamrah i returned, im not sure if its the fragrance's problem or if i am just overestimating the projection of it. 

longevity wise, the regular khamrah was actually really good. I sprayed it on a cloth, left it overnight and in the morning it still smelt, and i will be doing the same test for the qahwa. 

Overall, i like it a lot, rly good price. Ill wear it tomorrow to see if im just noseblind or it does have weaker projection. Unrelated:  Im planning on getting hawas ice next because theres a good deal on fragrancex, probably get 9 pm afnan too. ",2,1741894989.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

Probably the best possible way to learn a language is living where it’s spoken and hearing it, seeing it, and using it every day. But unfortunately full immersion is not always an option.. so here are my three favorite Apps that I use to practice Spanish as effectively as possible!

1. **Coffee Break Languages:** short, interesting podcasts. I usually listen to them while in my car or doing chores at home.
2. **Jolii AI:** the best mix of watching real videos and learning from them. I can save words, review them and test myself with quizzes based on the videos I’ve actually watched. I can also import my own videos.
3. **Tandem:** that’s where I can find native speakers to chat or even call. This is challenging at times, but I do get to do real speaking practice.

Any ideas?,"So I'm going to give a theoretical situation. Because it would actually take longer to explain in full. So here are my limits in a simple simulation. 

TLDR, need a diet advice that allows me to buy ONLY once a week, have no fridge and no freezer. (I cannot currently can my own food but I'm trying to get there).


Pretend you stranded an hour+ from civilization. With no income. No vehicle. Once a week someone bring you into town and pays only for your groceries and water. They will not buy anything else for you. (Please remember no income) You only have a cabin with no electricity or running water, no internet. . Life is decent. You're warm, you're fed, you have clean water and body weight exercises.  BUT without fridge, you left with minimumal diet based in shelf stable, ""camp"" food. You eat as much healthy veggies and meats as you can on the day you go into town. But veggies and fruit, raw meats, won't last beyond a couple days. You can hunt and gather a bit but it's not a guaranteed source. You can grow food. But you can't necessarily rely on that because of weather and pests, and difficulty in storage. Also very minimal resources for addements to the garden which affects harvest. How would you keep up healthy eating in this situation? And train for strength and functional agility.

#####


Right now I'm eating mostly

Tuna or chicken sandwiches

Steamed rice with dry or canned beans.

Mesa for tortillas. 

Canned salmon soup with canned veggies. (Lowest sodium I can find)

Pasta and sauce with canned chicken

Peanut butter jelly sandwiches

Macnchese and chili

Some mix-with-water drinks for now and then break from plain water. Coolaid, hot cocoa, tea, coffee, mio, drink to go sticks. 

I use butter, sauces, and mayonnaise, because it's shelf stable as long as no bact is introduced into it.  And sticking it in the coolest corner of the cabin keeps it from melting in the heat for 10 months of the year. i bury a bucket with the heat sensitive food for the hottest parts of the year, but if anything seems even slightly off, it get tossed no questions. It's not safe for meats, and veggies still go bad super fast.

When I go into town I try to get really good quality perishable groceries for my meals for the next two days.

I've been struggling with my health for years. But I've been in this type of situation for about 6 years now. And I need to lose the excess body fat and get some level of strength. I feel so old and sick at 40. But every time I try to work out, slowly and steadily. I can feel the lack of quality food hitting me hard. I wonder if there's anything I can do? 

I don't have tons of money, or I would just dump thousands on a fancy off the grid setup to run a nice big fridge and freezer. Etc. I've actually been trying that for the last three years. And, well if you ever been poor poor. IYKYK. 

But I think I can manage my food if there's a suggestion there. Maybe have to buy a few extra items on regular basis. I'm also not sure how nutrition works well enough to hack it. If you you eat your protein on a full moon then you only need to eat 1/3 of your carb on Fridays. You get what I mean? 

I'm dreading posting this. I can just hear people telling me... get rich, try harder, you're only failing this/that because you're not motivated enough to will it into existence. If you really wanted it, it would just * poof * there it is. 

This is where I'm at. And it won't likely change anytime soon. 


Please thank you. So very much. 😁

Edit: in case it matters, my main exercise is body weight. A lot of random walking, sprinting, swimming and even climbing trees, scaling steep hollows is its own workiut.  I think I might be getting healthy enough to try and  practice some free running. That's been my dream for so long but I've been afraid of breaking something. My dumbbells were stolen recently.

I started my morning as usual; I put the coffee machine to work while planning to make some simple toast. As I was making it, I noticed I couldn't remember where I'd put my breakfast butter. I searched everywhere: under pillows, behind plates, and even inside my computer drawer! I came to the conclusion that I was probably a former contestant in the ""Who Can Hide Their Own Things"" contest without even knowing it. At that moment, I decided to start making my cup of coffee, which, apparently, had received love from everything in the house, even the walls, which had started smiling at me (perhaps remembering their old days as park benches). After a few minutes of laughter and reflection, I decided to turn the chaos into an opportunity for creativity. I made a ""mystery breakfast,"" where every bite held a surprise.

doctors have suggested PCOS in me for a long time, but no ultrasounds have shown cysts. i got bloodwork done within the past month and my thyroid, FSH, LH, progesterone, and estrogen came back in decent range. my DHEA, testosterone, pregenolone, and ALP are elevated, and my 3:30PM cortisol was low-normal, even after having a dumb fight that the phlebotomist picked with me that had my heart pounding lmfao. 
my OBGYN was like, ""this doesn't look like PCOS, it looks like NCAH. i'm referring you to endocrinology"" i didn't even know what she was talking about lol.

for background about my symptoms:

my hair barely ever grew as a child, was always thinner--- i've never been able to have long hair, ex. when i was a toddler i had a pixie cut, not because my mom wanted it that way, but because it wasn't growing longer. 

i was an extraordinarily anxious child for as long as i have memories, and always had anxiety nightmares, even before things went particularly south at home. 

PUBERTY: i was an extremely tall and skinny child, always the tallest girl in my grade since pre-k by inches, started puberty at 7, and and reached menarche at 9. at 10-11, my bones fused at 5'2"". i'm the shortest person on both sides of my family by a few inches, my mom is 5'8 and my dad is 5'10. all of the women on my mom's side are between 5'6-6'0 and the women on my dad's side aren't as tall but still around 5'6. i gained a lot of weight and purple stretch marks rapidly at 11, it was shocking and embarrassing to go from being rail thin to overweight. i developed acne, got made fun of by other girls for having a deep voice, mature body hair, and having boobs (my voice is normal pitch for a woman at 25 now). my period was already very irregular, heavy, PMDD symptoms, and i ALWAYS had painful cramps to the point of not being able to walk and having to quit dance school at 11. i presented with other strange unpleasant symptoms like vomiting and nosebleeds. my body odor was really kicking, my feet and armpits shortly after i got my period were always sweaty and smelled horrible. i also became extremely depressed and had a childhood-onset psychotic break. i haven't read any association with schizoaffective disorder (my mental health diagnosis since i was 20) and NCAH besides early androgen exposure, but my brother had schizophreniform years ago and has bipolar 1 and doesn't have any symptoms of male pattern NCAH, so i think it might be unrelated, maybe NCAH could have sped it up for me? idk.

i lost some weight when i was about 14 but still had very irregular and painful periods. i got on the NuvaRing at 17 and rapidly lost about 20 lbs, i hadn't weighed 100lbs since i was 10 (bearing in mind i was already 5'2"" and had a developed body) and went from being constantly fatigued to passing out at 10pm and waking up at 6 with loads of energy, ready to go to yoga and spend all day busy. i went off the ring when i was 20, rapidly gained 30 pounds again, and have gained 20 more since. it's hard to take off.

i first abused my brother's adderall and vyvanse when i was 10, something clicked with it and i finally felt happy and normal. fast forward to 19, i had a crippling cocaine addiction, daily use to the point where i had the WBC of a leukemia patient. i got addicted again later on and i'm now 25 have been sober since oct 2021. i take 20mg prescribed vyvanse in the morning for depression and concentration which helps me i and am really addicted to nicotine caffeine, and i've read that stimulant addiction can be a little-known symptom of NCAH due to the constant depletion of cortisol.

my adult symptoms are constant oligomenorrhea with heavy painful periods, like anywhere from 27-100 days between cycles. very oily skin, hair, and adult acne. severe daytime fatigue and executive dysfunction, so for example, i got out of bed at 11 today after sleeping 12 hours, had a redbull and coffee, and had to lay back down at 2pm for an hour until my boyfriend encouraged me multiple times to get up and enjoy the day. i'd still rather be in bed! i have bad anxiety that leads to insomnia at bedtime though. i suffer severe brain fog/fatigue/dissociation. i have to pee all the time from childhood to now (i peed my pants until i was 12 and i still get into trouble at work and school for taking frequent bathroom breaks but i just HAVE to go) plus sweating a lot and i think that's why i'm always so so cold. i also don't get ""puffy"" from eating salt the way my girlfriends complain they do. i have CRIPPLING anxiety daily, like every day is one long anxiety attack, my mood swings usually lean toward depression with mild suicide ideation. i know these mood issues are mainly schizoaffective, but i can't help but think NCAH is making it worse, and that the fatigue is more NCAH related. 

if anyone could give me some support or feedback, if anyone can let me know what holistic stuff helped you most with fatigue, bad anxiety, being overweight, and irregular periods, please do. 
i already take 4 medications for mental health stuff, so i am open to trying and learning about NCAH meds but hesitant to start anything new :/ 
should i just try birth control again, since it made my period regular and i lost weight? idek why it even caused me to lose weight, i'm new to this. i take bioidentical progesterone and vitex for my cycle now.

TLDR;
tall child to precocious puberty and stunted growth pipeline, severe weight gain at puberty, fatigue, painful oligomenorrhea, slightly overweight adult, oily skin/hair/adult acne, thin hair, severe anxiety, PCOS basically ruled out

P.S. it will take a month for the endocrinologist to call me, and i know they have to order 17-OH progesterone and maybe an ACTH stim, anything else? i would like to get genetic testing, but idk how to go about that.

1jaki5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1jaki5d/hilton_playa_del_carmen_review/,Hilton Playa Del Carmen Review,"I wanted to give an extensive and thorough review of my Hilton Playa Del Carmen experience. Like many on here, we research and look through so many articles, reviews, maps, etc... before going on these trips. Rather than piecing together a myriad of previous posts and cross-refrencing them, I hope to answer many questions for those considering this resort. It's going to be quite a lengthy read so please feel free to skip on by!


The largest point I want to make that others have touched on is THIS IS A PAY TO PLAY RESORT. Can you eat and drink with plenty of options for free? Of course! But there are many opportunities to enhance your experience with premium add-ons.


Now that that's out of the way let's begin! My wife (31F) and I (31M) went to Playa Del Carmen for our honeymoon last week after getting married two days prior. We flew into Cozumel and took the ferry over, which was lovely! I see that people often fly into Cancun and take an airport transfer. We wanted to avoid large spring break crowds and a lengthy van ride so we opted for the ferry option from Cozumel. Once we arrived by ferry it was a 1.6km walk (one mile) down Quinta Avenida to the Hilton on Constituyentes. With our luggage in tow we agreed to take a taxi for 200 pesos (10 USD) to the hotel. ALWAYS agree on a price before getting a taxi.


Upon arrival we were promptly greeted by the bellman who loaded our luggage. We were then offered an infused water beverage and taken to the separate Hilton honors check-in to the right. Upon check in we were given a coupon book for premium services (excursions, specialty dinners, massages, etc...). We were then escorted to a table in which they mentioned a presentation for future travel benefits which we politely declined. They were not pushy at all about this and it was nice to get out of the way as soon as we arrived. After being handed off by several check in employees the bellman took us to our room in the back of the resort by the quiet pool. It's much larger here than I originally had anticipated!


Our room was a standard king on the second floor. We had considered bidding for an upgrade but upon reflection we were happy to have saved the money. We didn't spend much time in the room aside from sleeping and showering. The double tub was fun but admittedly only used it once to drink a bottle of Cava they had gifted us for our honeymoon. That first night, tired from traveling, we ordered room service and fell asleep quite early. The room service was good and took about 30 minutes to arrive. 


Our first full day there we went to the coffee shop (called Aromas) for delicious iced cold brew and pastries in the early morning. We walked around the resort to get a feel for everything. We then made our dinner reservations with the concierge for that night and remainder of the week: Kalamata, Ma Petrona, Asiana, Chef's Table, and Carnivore dinner (in that order). Two of the nights we had dinner on Quinta Avenida. We then proceeded to book a cabana by the pool ($170 USD) and enjoyed a lovely day talking about our wedding and relaxing. You do get a discount on cabanas for Hilton Status which is nice. They also included free activities like water aerobics, bingo, and water volleyball. With our Cabana service for the higher price we received a bottle of Don Julio. You do get a choice of premium vodka, tequila, or sparkling wine. There's a cheaper option with no alcohol ($130 USD). We ate at Kalamata that evening after a long pool day and I thought the food was good (7/10). The evening entertainment is included and was better some nights than others. I'd recommend checking out the daily schedule and seeing if your interests are piqued. 


The next day we mostly stayed in the coffee shop reading in the morning (and nursing a nice sunburn). We then traveled out to Quinta Avenida and bought magnets, shirts, sunglasses, etc... Overall, it was a lax day with no agenda. We ate on 5th Avenue at SushiRoll for their dinner BOGO special and it was DELICIOUS. Total for 4 rolls, 2 sodas, and tip was $39 USD! That BOGO special is Monday-Wednesday for those wondering. (9/10)


On Wednesday we did a lot of self-care with hydrotherapy (sauna, steam room, cold plunge, hot tub etc...) before doing a couples massage. This was certainly the biggest expense that we added on our trip. With the couples massage we were allowed access to all of the hydrotherapy for the entire stay which was nice. I do have to add that the only time I felt pressured to add anything during our week was right after our lovely massage and facials. It was a bit off-putting after having JUST finished a pricey massage ($300 + $75 for tip). She kept asking if we'd like a discounted massage later in the week and I had to say ""no"" 4 times before heading back to the locker rooms. We ate at Asiana that evening and it was by far my favorite cost-included restaurant. The Gyozas were incredible, service attentive, and atmosphere soothing. The soups and sushi were also phenomenal. When we return to PDC we are certainly eating here twice! (10/10).


Thursday we started meeting a number of couples by the pool who were all fantastic people. We engaged in many of the activities and had a great time. We decided on another cabana but there are plenty of seat options and certainly not necessary to splurge for the upgrade. We both agreed that it was our honeymoon and we would go all out. A big tip would be agreeing on what you're okay with spending money on BEFORE getting to the resort. We had discussed the cabanas, bottles of wine, and upgraded dining beforehand and knew we would be okay with saying yes to them. We ate at Ma Petrona that evening and I'll be totally honest here, I was too sunburned and inebriated to give a good review on food choices (?/10) (whoops!).


On Friday we explored 5th Avenue more and went down to the beach by the ferry/statues. The water was gorgeous and we're very happy we did it. We spent the afternoon at the pool playing water volleyball and going down to the diamond cabanas by the beach. That evening we had reservations at Chef's Table which was an added $119 for 2. This was an INCREDIBLE dinner (10/10). It's quite small and elegant. The service was so friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed all dishes and little palette cleansers between courses. They had a live piano player and it was a very special evening that I'll always remember. The entertainment that night was fantastic and a show of Mexican heritage with singing, dancing, roping, and acrobatics. This was overall probably our favorite day there. 


Saturday morning we visited Cenote Azul and went snorkeling. Definitely recommend arriving as soon as it opens to enjoy a more peaceful atmosphere before it gets crowded. We took a Taxi instead of the Collectivo (shuttle bus). Again, it's important to discuss the fare before getting in a taxi. We agreed on 600 pesos (30 USD) for one way. We then made our way back to the resort for an afternoon of (you guessed it) pool activities. Our final dinner was called the Carnivore dinner down by the ocean Gazebo. It was an add-on for $220 I believe before using a coupon for 25% off. This was an intimate small number of tables by the ocean. There was a live duo music group that played renditions of songs. All food was cooked over a large grill and was really tasty. The entire atmosphere was very special and both my partner and I cried once or twice from the beautiful music and reflecting on such a perfect week/honeymoon. They gave us 4 different cuts of steak and I was so incredibly full that I could have rolled back to my room. There were also appetizers, soups, cocktails, etc... included in the add-on price. I would recommend this premium dinner if you are celebrating something big 10/10. 


A separate side note here is PRACTICE SPANISH. I practiced for 4 months leading up to our trip and very happy that I did. Everyone will speak English to you but they love communicating in their national language and it's great practice. Also, highly encourage using Pesos for the best exchange rate when buying goods in town/on excursions. 


Overall, it was an incredible trip and had exactly what we were looking for. We wanted the option to relax but also be social and have fun. 


I'd probably skip the massage for my next visit or get one in town as they are much more affordable. 


Please ask any and all questions you may have! If you've read this whole thing then I am VERY thankful to you!

1jakhor,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jakhor/my_boss_keeps_telling_me_my_boyfriend_wont_love/,My boss keeps telling me my boyfriend won’t love me due to his new heart,"I wanna say this will be short or long but if I need to I'll just do updates.

I (18nb bioF) work for a small business where my boss (M ~30-36) is the owner of the business. One thing I should mention is that my boss is Moroccan and is Muslim and this could possibly be why he is so mean to me. 

On the Friday before making this post my boyfriend (M17, 18 in a week) got called into get his transplant. He's been on the heart transplant list for almost 6 months and was excited for the month of March. He's had planned his 18th birthday party with over 20 of his close friends and their s/o's or other friends. When he got called for the surgery he came to me, while at work, crying saying he's gonna miss me. I of course was stressed the entire time after.

Now as a side note he didn't get his heart until Monday due to the donor family having a kid they lost and needed time with them.

My coworkers I'll call them A, J, and S were all rightfully concerned and mindful not to be rude, even joking with me because I was just talking about how my bf and I met and that it was perfect timing. However my boss, well call him H, was asking the dumbest questions. 

""What if he doesn't love you with his new heart?""

Now I'm no idiot, and love sadly doesn't come from the heart so I told him, ""Love is not something from the heart. It's a chemical reaction with the brain...""

And I lost him. He obviously wanted to get under my skin and after he learned I was not worried he dropped it.

The next day was any normal Saturday at work and again everyone was mindful EXCEPT FOR HIM. He again loudly told his, what I can only assume is an affair partner (a story for another time), ""DID YOU KNOW THAT OPs BOYFRIEND OS GETTING A NEW HEART?!""

I'll be calling the affair partner bitch because she is one, ""What if he doesn't love you the same? Like with his new heart he loves someone else.""

I try explaining the chemical reaction and again it falls of deaf ears. I then think with my amazing brain 'ignore them and it will be great'. 

Then Sunday, this was the day bf told me surgery was supposed to be (it turned out to be Monday) so I was stressed out of my mind. I couldn't think straight and anything I did was delayed and spaced out. However just about 2 or 3 hours into my shift my boss picks a fight with S, a 18 y/o busser who got paid under the table. Now before everyone says anything about that it's a whole nother story, however he fired her and she sat there in the restaurant for another 5 ish hours because Bitch was her ride home. When A and I got of work we invited S to come to the cafe next door to get coffee. S then told me and A all about how H shit talked us with Bitch and how much he in particular hated me. Now I understand he's fasting during Ramadan however these stories dated all the way back to before it started. Although the stories are long I'll give a sum up. h and Bitch we're crowding the cutting counter so I had to take a cutting board and cut something on the opposite side of the kitchen, they were laughing at me. H and bitch have some issues keeping it in their pants because they rub each others backs (and not in a casual way). I went to cut something in the back of the kitchen and H said that I'm a deaf idiot who can't do anything right. There was more about A but she wasn't my concern. 

I felt so upset and looked down at my phone to see my phone blowing up with texts. I later found out seurgwry had been pushed and I needed to get home for some arbitrary reason. 

When I got back to work yesterday after my boyfriends surgery guess who had something rude to say? If you said H you'd be correct. ""What if the new heart loves another woman? What if he cheats on you?""

I snapped ""H I'm not in the mood! I've been stressed out all day so please don't worry me more.""

He stopped for the time but I worry that when I go to see my bf on Monday H will say something rude again and I will be at my limit. I haven't found another job yet but I also don't want to get told that my boyfriend doesn't love me.


Just as another portion about Bitch and H. Bitch isn't a bitch because she is a cheater, she gives me chemical burns, yells at me for no reason and obviously talks about me behind me back. Also while I was doing dishes she asked H is his penis was big and if he touches himself,knowing that I am right there in earshot as well as the same age as her daughter. 

Another thing is before someone says he's not allowed to talk to woman without his wife being in the room, we're all girls who work for H, and his wife is never there. He's married with a 5 year old and calls minors hot (even after being told their minors)

The deaf comment has to do with the music and the water making it hard for me to hear as well as the fact that partial deafness due to misshapen bone in the ear canal runs in my family (which I actually don't have :/ so his bs comment is rude)

As for any further medical things I will not explain in an update for my bfs anonymity, however me and bf have disformed hearts at birth so my understanding of his condition is extensive and my discrediting is not due to lack of understanding. 

I will not name my boss' business or where it is located due to its current popularity and as to not tarnish a business for no proper cause. 

Let me know if there's other information that needs to be said. However I am down to be as petty as need be ",2,1741894230.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

1jakg5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jakg5v/i_feel_like_bella_sitting_in_her_room_in_new_moon/,I feel like Bella sitting in her room in New Moon.,"A hole in my chest. Another in my head. I’m 23, and we’ve been together since high school—lots of ons and offs, but always finding our way back. The last big ""off"" was in 2020, when I left to study abroad. We broke up to avoid long distance, but COVID brought us back together. A year and a half of LDR, two years of being together, and now, once again, we were trying to survive the distance.

I left in August for my master’s. I had been trying to talk about my insecurities and fears for months before, but he either said it was too painful or reassured me that we’d figure it out. It’s just 9 months, and I even came home for two. But the distance was harder than expected. My loneliness, his stress, our unspoken fears—it all built up.

We had a plan: he’d apply for his master’s for fall 2025, and I’d apply for PhDs. We would try to end up in the same place. He’s been talking about this for three years, swore he wanted it. We even sat together in January while I applied. But months passed, and he still hadn’t. When I asked if he was sure, he was offended—""Why would I lie?"" But it felt like he was.

I got more anxious, he got more defensive. The fights got worse. I felt like he wasn’t trying for our future, he felt like I wasn’t seeing how exhausted he was. It spiraled. Then, suddenly, he said he might not even want to do a master’s at all. That he’s too tired, that he can’t think clearly, that I never recognized his struggle. And then, he ended it.

I know people will say I’m young, that love at this age isn’t forever. But I know he is the love of my life. It’s not just the years, it’s not just love—it’s a frequency only we share. He is my person. My favorite. My home. This breakup may be the last, I know that. But I can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t how our story is supposed to end. Last night, while for the whole week we were trying to talk it out and he was the one terrified to end things. He had tickets to come visit today. He just said he can't do it anymore last time. He did not come. 

He kept saying that we have to end it know so that our love doesn't die. That we are just eating it up with all the conflict. That he needs to decide what he wants to do and have clarity ""if we want to have a chance in the future."" I know I cannot change his mind. He is not like me, I sometimes mention a breakup in need for him to just comfort me. He does not do that. He also deals with some family things, a relative in the hospital very seriously ill so him not coming had to do with that also. I know that he is exhausted I knwo that we both pushed it and LDR is anyway bad. I told him that was unfair. The phonecall lasted 10 minuted because I didn't try to change his mind. Believe me he needs time to realize what he did. to be on his own and to think. I respect that. He did not say he needed time he said he wanted to break up but at the same time talked about talking about it when I am back home next month. I was the one to cut the call and I refused to open my camera. It was not a breakup of a 8 year relationship. But there was nothing to say. He left the possibility open and I know it is not a keeping options open kind of thing. He did not break up with me to fck around I know. And as anrgy as I am he is right that we would end hating one another. We did need time apart. But why call this a breakup?  What to do know? i really hope we have another chance after the dust settles after we each realise what our mistakes were. I am probably not starting a PhD next year because I want to give the GRE to have more options before deciding. I may do a second masters but in general I am treating next year as a PhD prep more than anything concrete. So I could even prioritize him and try to be where he is. This does not mean I am sacrifising my future, I am only willing to give us a serious chance. But know what? I am willing to do my best to make this work yet I am unsure how to approach him. I thought of doing what he said, not send anything until I get back home and then tell him to go for coffee see how we are in one month. But I do not know how I will wait a month. He essentially broke up with me, I cannot contact him. But i was the one who cut the conversation short. ",2,1741894117.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1jakcam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1jakcam/the_playa_del_carmen_review/,THE Playa Del Carmen Review!,"I wanted to give an extensive and thorough review of my Hilton Playa Del Carmen experience. Like many on here, we research and look through so many articles, reviews, maps, etc... before going on these trips. Rather than piecing together a myriad of previous posts and cross-refrencing them, I hope to answer many questions for those considering this resort. It's going to be quite a lengthy read so please feel free to skip on by!


The largest point I want to make that others have touched on is THIS IS A PAY TO PLAY RESORT. Can you eat and drink with plenty of options for free? Of course! But there are many opportunities to enhance your experience with premium add-ons.


Now that that's out of the way let's begin! My wife (31F) and I (31M) went to Playa Del Carmen for our honeymoon last week after getting married two days prior. We flew into Cozumel and took the ferry over, which was lovely! I see that people often fly into Cancun and take an airport transfer. We wanted to avoid large spring break crowds and a lengthy van ride so we opted for the ferry option from Cozumel. Once we arrived by ferry it was a 1.6km walk (one mile) down Quinta Avenida to the Hilton on Constituyentes. With our luggage in tow we agreed to take a taxi for 200 pesos (10 USD) to the hotel. ALWAYS agree on a price before getting a taxi.


Upon arrival we were promptly greeted by the bellman who loaded our luggage. We were then offered an infused water beverage and taken to the separate Hilton honors check-in to the right. Upon check in we were given a coupon book for premium services (excursions, specialty dinners, massages, etc...). We were then escorted to a table in which they mentioned a presentation for future travel benefits which we politely declined. They were not pushy at all about this and it was nice to get out of the way as soon as we arrived. After being handed off by several check in employees the bellman took us to our room in the back of the resort by the quiet pool. It's much larger here than I originally had anticipated!


Our room was a standard king on the second floor. We had considered bidding for an upgrade but upon reflection we were happy to have saved the money. We didn't spend much time in the room aside from sleeping and showering. The double tub was fun but admittedly only used it once to drink a bottle of Cava they had gifted us for our honeymoon. That first night, tired from traveling, we ordered room service and fell asleep quite early. The room service was good and took about 30 minutes to arrive. 


Our first full day there we went to the coffee shop (called Aromas) for delicious iced cold brew and pastries in the early morning. We walked around the resort to get a feel for everything. We then made our dinner reservations with the concierge for that night and remainder of the week: Kalamata, Ma Petrona, Asiana, Chef's Table, and Carnivore dinner (in that order). Two of the nights we had dinner on Quinta Avenida. We then proceeded to book a cabana by the pool ($170 USD) and enjoyed a lovely day talking about our wedding and relaxing. You do get a discount on cabanas for Hilton Status which is nice. They also included free activities like water aerobics, bingo, and water volleyball. With our Cabana service for the higher price we received a bottle of Don Julio. You do get a choice of premium vodka, tequila, or sparkling wine. There's a cheaper option with no alcohol ($130 USD). We ate at Kalamata that evening after a long pool day and I thought the food was good (7/10). The evening entertainment is included and was better some nights than others. I'd recommend checking out the daily schedule and seeing if your interests are piqued. 


The next day we mostly stayed in the coffee shop reading in the morning (and nursing a nice sunburn). We then traveled out to Quinta Avenida and bought magnets, shirts, sunglasses, etc... Overall, it was a lax day with no agenda. We ate on 5th Avenue at SushiRoll for their dinner BOGO special and it was DELICIOUS. Total for 4 rolls, 2 sodas, and tip was $39 USD! That BOGO special is Monday-Wednesday for those wondering. (9/10)


On Wednesday we did a lot of self-care with hydrotherapy (sauna, steam room, cold plunge, hot tub etc...) before doing a couples massage. This was certainly the biggest expense that we added on our trip. With the couples massage we were allowed access to all of the hydrotherapy for the entire stay which was nice. I do have to add that the only time I felt pressured to add anything during our week was right after our lovely massage and facials. It was a bit off-putting after having JUST finished a pricey massage ($300 + $75 for tip). She kept asking if we'd like a discounted massage later in the week and I had to say ""no"" 4 times before heading back to the locker rooms. We ate at Asiana that evening and it was by far my favorite cost-included restaurant. The Gyozas were incredible, service attentive, and atmosphere soothing. The soups and sushi were also phenomenal. When we return to PDC we are certainly eating here twice! (10/10).


Thursday we started meeting a number of couples by the pool who were all fantastic people. We engaged in many of the activities and had a great time. We decided on another cabana but there are plenty of seat options and certainly not necessary to splurge for the upgrade. We both agreed that it was our honeymoon and we would go all out. A big tip would be agreeing on what you're okay with spending money on BEFORE getting to the resort. We had discussed the cabanas, bottles of wine, and upgraded dining beforehand and knew we would be okay with saying yes to them. We ate at Ma Petrona that evening and I'll be totally honest here, I was too sunburned and inebriated to give a good review on food choices (?/10) (whoops!).


On Friday we explored 5th Avenue more and went down to the beach by the ferry/statues. The water was gorgeous and we're very happy we did it. We spent the afternoon at the pool playing water volleyball and going down to the diamond cabanas by the beach. That evening we had reservations at Chef's Table which was an added $119 for 2. This was an INCREDIBLE dinner (10/10). It's quite small and elegant. The service was so friendly and accommodating. We enjoyed all dishes and little palette cleansers between courses. They had a live piano player and it was a very special evening that I'll always remember. The entertainment that night was fantastic and a show of Mexican heritage with singing, dancing, roping, and acrobatics. This was overall probably our favorite day there. 


Saturday morning we visited Cenote Azul and went snorkeling. Definitely recommend arriving as soon as it opens to enjoy a more peaceful atmosphere before it gets crowded. We took a Taxi instead of the Collectivo (shuttle bus). Again, it's important to discuss the fare before getting in a taxi. We agreed on 600 pesos (30 USD) for one way. We then made our way back to the resort for an afternoon of (you guessed it) pool activities. Our final dinner was called the Carnivore dinner down by the ocean Gazebo. It was an add-on for $220 I believe before using a coupon for 25% off. This was an intimate small number of tables by the ocean. There was a live duo music group that played renditions of songs. All food was cooked over a large grill and was really tasty. The entire atmosphere was very special and both my partner and I cried once or twice from the beautiful music and reflecting on such a perfect week/honeymoon. They gave us 4 different cuts of steak and I was so incredibly full that I could have rolled back to my room. There were also appetizers, soups, cocktails, etc... included in the add-on price. I would recommend this premium dinner if you are celebrating something big 10/10. 


A separate side note here is PRACTICE SPANISH. I practiced for 4 months leading up to our trip and very happy that I did. Everyone will speak English to you but they love communicating in their national language and it's great practice. Also, highly encourage using Pesos for the best exchange rate when buying goods in town/on excursions. 



Overall, it was an incredible trip and had exactly what we were looking for. We wanted the option to relax but also be social and have fun. 



I'd probably skip the massage for my next visit or get one in town as they are much more affordable. 


Please ask any and all questions you may have! If you've read this whole thing then I am VERY thankful to you!

1jakc0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1jakc0p/minute_64/,Minute 64,"I always thought urban legends were just that: stories to scare us and make us lose sleep for no reason. As a biology student, I got used to looking for rational explanations for everything, even when something made me uneasy. But what happened to my friends and me that semester is still the only thing I haven’t been able to explain.

It all started one Friday afternoon, after a field practice. We had gathered in the faculty cafeteria to rest before heading home. Miguel, as usual, brought up a strange topic.

“Have you ever heard of the 'Night Call Syndrome'?” he asked, absentmindedly stirring his coffee.

Laura snorted, skeptical. “Let me guess. A creepypasta?”

“Kind of,” Miguel said with a smile. “They say some people get a call at 3:33 AM. The number doesn’t show up on the screen, just 'Unknown.' If you answer, at first you just hear noise, like someone breathing on the other side. But if you stay on the line long enough... you hear your own voice.”

A chill ran down my spine. Alejandra, who had been distracted with her phone until that moment, looked up.

“And what’s that voice supposed to say?” she asked.

Miguel put his cup down and leaned toward us.

“They say it tells you the exact time you’re going to die.”

Daniel burst out laughing. “How convenient. A death call that only happens at 3:33. Why not at 4:44 or something more dramatic?”

We laughed because that made sense. It was an absurd story, something told to make us uneasy, but nothing more.

“Come on, genetics class is about to start, and I don’t want Camilo to give us that hawk stare for walking in late,” I said, annoyed.

“Hurry up, I can’t miss genetics! I refuse to see that class with that guy again,” Miguel said, half worried, half annoyed.

We really hated the genetics class. It wasn’t the subject itself; it was... Camilo. He was the professor in charge, and he didn’t make things easy or comfortable for us. We grabbed our things and headed to class, hoping to understand at least something of what that teacher said.

In the following days, the conversation about the night call was forgotten. We had exams coming up, lab practices, and an ecology report that was driving us crazy. But then, five nights after that conversation, something happened.

It was almost four in the morning when my phone vibrated on the nightstand. I woke up startled and, still groggy, squinted at the screen. It was a message from Alejandra.

""Are you awake?""

I frowned. It wasn’t unusual for Alejandra to stay up late, but she never texted me at this hour. I replied with a simple ""What’s up?"" Almost immediately, the three dots appeared, indicating she was typing.

“They called me.”

I felt a void in my stomach. “Who?” I typed with trembling fingers.

“I don’t know. No number showed up. It just said 'Unknown.'”

I stared at the screen, waiting for more, but Alejandra stopped typing. The silence of the night became heavy, like the room had shrunk around me.

“Did you answer?” I finally wrote.

A few eternal seconds passed before her response came.

“Yes.”

The air caught in my throat.

“And what did you hear?”

The three dots appeared again, but this time they took longer. When her response finally arrived, it gave me chills.

“My voice. It said my name. And then... it told me an exact time.”

My heart started pounding. I sat up abruptly, turned on the light, and dialed her number. It rang three times before she answered.

“Ale, tell me this is a joke,” I whispered.

There was a brief silence before she spoke. She sounded scared.

“I’m not joking. They told me a date and time: Thursday at 3:33 AM. And it was my voice, my own voice!”

My skin crawled. Thursday was only two days away. I stayed silent, the phone pressed to my ear. I wanted to say something, anything that would calm Alejandra, but I couldn’t find the words. Her breathing was shallow, as if she was on the verge of a panic attack.

“Ale, this has to be a joke,” I finally said, trying to sound firm.

“That’s what I thought…” Her voice trembled. “I want to think someone’s messing with me, but... I felt something. It wasn’t just a call, it wasn’t static noise. It was my voice. And it sounded so sure when it said the time…”

I ran a hand over my face, trying to shake off the numbness of the early morning.

“It has to be Miguel,” I blurted. “He was the one who told us that story, he’s probably messing with us.”

Alejandra took a moment to respond.

“Yeah… I guess so,” she said, but she didn’t sound convinced.

“Think about it,” I insisted. “In all those stories, there’s a trigger, something people do to activate the curse or whatever. In creepypastas, there’s always a ritual, a cursed website, a mirror at midnight, touching a forbidden object, selling your soul to the devil, something! But we didn’t do anything.”

A silence settled over the line.

“Right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.

Alejandra didn’t respond immediately.

I shuddered. For a moment, I imagined both of us mentally reviewing the past few days, trying to find a moment where we’d done something out of the ordinary, something that could have triggered this. But there was nothing. At least, nothing we remembered.

“We need to talk to Miguel,” I said finally. “If this is a joke, he’ll confess.”

“Yeah…” Alejandra whispered.

“Try to sleep, okay? We’ll clear this up tomorrow... well, later, when we meet at university.”

“I don’t think I can.”

I didn’t know how to respond. We stayed on the line a few more seconds before finally hanging up. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling. I tried to convince myself it was all nonsense, but the skin on my arms was still crawling. I couldn’t stop thinking about the time.

Thursday, 3:33 AM.

It was stupid, but I couldn’t help but check my phone screen. 3:57 AM. I swallowed and turned off the light. That night, I couldn’t sleep, drifting into what seemed like deep sleep, only to wake up suddenly. I checked my phone again. 4:38 AM. I’d be wasting my time if I tried to sleep. I had to leave now if I wanted to make it to the 7:00 AM class. I’d have to try to sleep a little on the bus.

That morning, we showed up with the faces of the sleepless. Alejandra looked pale, with furrowed brows, but didn’t say anything when she saw me. We just walked together to the faculty, in silence. We found Miguel in the courtyard, laughing with Daniel and Laura. Like nothing had happened. Like he hadn’t just played a sick prank on us. I crossed my arms and stood in front of him.

“Very funny, Miguel,” I said, without even greeting him.

He looked up, confused.

“Huh? Good morning, how are you? I’m good, thanks for asking,” he said in an ironic and playful tone.

Alejandra didn’t say anything, she just stayed a few steps behind me, lips tight.

“The call,” I said. “You can stop the show now.”

Miguel blinked.

“What call?”

I frowned.

“Come on, don’t play dumb. The 3:33 call. The creepypasta you told us. Alejandra got it last night.”

Laura and Daniel exchanged glances. Miguel, on the other hand, stood still.

“What?”

His tone didn’t sound like fake surprise. I didn’t like that.

“If this is a joke, you can stop now... because it’s not funny,” I warned.

“I’m not joking,” he said, quietly. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My stomach twisted. Alejandra tensed beside me.

“What do you mean ‘no idea’? You told us the story,” Alejandra whispered.

“Yeah, but…” Miguel scratched his neck, uneasy. “I just heard it from a cousin. I never said it was real.”

An uncomfortable silence settled between us.

“Okay, calm down,” Daniel said, raising his hands. “If Miguel didn’t do it, then someone’s messing with you. Couldn’t it just be some random guy with too much free time?”

“How can it be random if the voice I heard was mine?” Alejandra snapped.

We all fell silent. Miguel rubbed his hands together nervously.

“Look... if this is real,” he said quietly, “the story I heard said something else.”

Alejandra and I looked at him, tense.

“If you get the call and answer... there’s no way to avoid it.”

The air seemed to thicken.

“That’s stupid,” I said, trying to laugh, but my voice sounded hollow.

“That’s what the story said,” Miguel insisted, looking at us seriously. “And there’s more.”

We waited.

“If Alejandra answered… she won’t be the only one to get the call.”

A chill ran down my spine. I slowly turned to Alejandra, but she was already looking at me, wide-eyed. Daniel broke the silence with a nervous laugh.

“Well, then it’s easy. No one answers calls from 'Unknown,' and that’s it.”

“And if you don’t have a choice?” Alejandra asked, in a whisper.

I didn’t understand what she meant until my phone vibrated in my pocket. I felt a cold jolt in my chest. I pulled the phone out with trembling fingers. On the screen, there was no number. Just one word.

Unknown.

The phone kept vibrating in my hand. Fear gripped my chest, freezing my fingers.

“Don’t answer,” Alejandra whispered, wide-eyed.

Laura and Daniel looked at us, frowning, waiting for me to do something. Miguel, however, looked too serious, as if he already knew what was going to happen. I swallowed. It was just a call. Nothing more. If I didn’t answer, I’d just be feeding the irrational fear that Miguel had planted with his stupid story. I had to show Alejandra nothing was going to happen. But my hands trembled. The buzzing of the phone seemed to reverberate in my bones.

“Don’t do it…” Alejandra insisted, grabbing my arm.

I swallowed. And I answered.

“H-Hello?”

Nothing. White noise. A soft, intermittent sound, like someone breathing on the other side of the line. A chill ran down my spine.

I looked at my friends, wide-eyed. Miguel watched me, tense, as if waiting for the worst. Laura and Daniel stared at me, holding their breath. Alejandra shook her head, terrified. I wanted to hang up too. I needed to. I moved my finger toward the screen. And then, a familiar voice broke the silence.

“Hello? Sweetheart?”

I felt deflated. It was my mom. I put a hand to my chest, releasing the air I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.

“Mom...” my voice came out shaky. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing, honey. You left your phone on the table, and I noticed when I got to the office. I’m calling you from here. Everything okay?”

I couldn't believe it. I turned to Alejandra and the others with a trembling smile. I sighed, feeling ridiculous for being so scared.

""Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.""

""Well, see you at home. Don't forget to buy what I asked for.""

""Yeah... okay.""

I hung up and let my arm drop, suddenly feeling exhausted. I turned to my friends.

""It was my mom.""

Alejandra's shoulders slumped. Daniel and Laura exchanged glances and laughed in relief.

""I knew it,"" Daniel said, shaking his head. ""We're overthinking this.""

Alejandra still looked tense, but she let out a sigh.

""God... I swear, I thought that...""

""That what?"" I interrupted, smiling. ""That a curse fell on us just because Miguel told us an internet story?""

Alejandra didn’t answer. Miguel, however, was still staring at me, frowning.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

He took a while to respond.

""Did your mom call you from her office?""

""Yeah... why?""

Miguel squinted.

""Then why did it say 'Unknown' on the screen?""

The relief evaporated in my chest. I froze.

""What...?""

I looked at the phone screen. The call wasn’t in the history. The fear hit me again, hard. Alejandra put a hand over her mouth. Daniel and Laura stopped smiling. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Because the last thing my mom said before hanging up... was that I had forgotten my phone at home.

But it was in my hand.

The silence grew thick. No one spoke.

I looked at my phone screen, my fingers stiff around it. It wasn’t in the call history. There was no record of me answering. And my mom’s voice… I swallowed.

""I... I heard her. I'm sure she said I left the phone at home.""

Alejandra shifted uncomfortably beside me, crossing her arms over her chest.

""But... you have it in your hand.""

My stomach churned.

""Maybe you just misunderstood,"" Daniel interjected, with his logical tone, as if he were explaining a simple math problem. ""You said you were nervous, and you were. Your mom probably said she left the phone on the table. That she left it at home, not your phone.""

I stared at him.

""You think I imagined it?""

""I’m not saying you imagined it, just that you interpreted it wrong. It's normal."" Daniel waved his hand. ""The brain tends to fill in information when it’s in an anxious state. Sometimes we hear what we’re afraid to hear.""

Alejandra nodded slowly, as if trying to convince herself he was right. Laura, on the other hand, still had her lips pursed.

""But the call history..."" she murmured.

""That is strange,"" Daniel admitted, ""but there are logical explanations. It could’ve been a glitch, or the number was hidden. There are apps that allow that.""

""And the white noise?"" Alejandra interrupted.

Daniel shrugged.

""Bad signal. My point is, if your mom called, that's the important part. All the rest are details that were exaggerated because we were scared.""

I crossed my arms. I wanted to believe him. I wanted him to be right. But something in my stomach wouldn’t let go. Miguel, who had been quiet up until now, rubbed his chin.

""Maybe it’s just that... or maybe it’s already started.""

Alejandra shot him a sharp look.

""Miguel!""

He shrugged with a half-smile, but didn’t seem as relaxed as he tried to appear.

""I’m just saying.""

Daniel scoffed.

""Stop saying nonsense.""

I looked at my phone again, my heart pounding. Maybe Daniel was right. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, it vibrated again in my hand. Unknown number.

I ignored the call. I didn’t even say anything to the others. I just blocked the screen, put my phone in my bag, and pretended nothing had happened. That everything was fine. I had a physiology exam to do. I couldn’t lose my mind now. But as soon as I sat in the classroom and saw the paper in front of me, I knew I couldn’t concentrate. The questions were there, waiting for answers I would’ve known by heart at another time. ""Why does a boa’s heart rate and ventilation decrease after hunting? What are the implications for its metabolism?""

I had no idea. Because my mind wasn’t here. I could only think about the call. About the word “Unknown” glowing on my screen. About the possibility that, at this very moment, my phone was vibrating inside my bag.

I tried to focus. I took a breath. I answered a few things with whatever my brain could piece together. But when time was up and they collected the papers, I knew my result would be disastrous.

We left in silence. Alejandra walked beside me with a frown, but didn’t say anything. Maybe she hadn’t done well either. When we reached the cafeteria, hunger hit all of us at the same time. A black hole in our stomachs. We had an hour before the lab, and if we didn’t eat now, we wouldn’t eat later.

We ordered food, sat at our usual table, and for a moment, the world felt normal again. Until I took out my phone. And saw the five missed calls. All from the same unknown number.

I didn’t eat.

While the others devoured their meals, I was completely absorbed in the screen of my phone. I needed to find the story.

I searched by keywords: mysterious call, unknown number, phone creepypasta, cursed night call, call at 3:33 a.m. Click after click, I entered forums, horror story websites, blogs with strange fonts and dark backgrounds. I read story after story, but none matched exactly what Miguel had told us that day. Something told me that if I understood the story well, if I found its origin, we could do something to get away from it. To prevent it from becoming our reality.

Everything around me became a distant murmur, background noise without importance. Until a hand appeared out of nowhere and snatched the phone from me. I blinked, surprised. Daniel was looking at me with a mix of pity and understanding.

""Seriously?"" he said, holding the phone as if he had just caught me in the middle of a madness.

I didn’t respond. Daniel sighed, swiped his finger across the screen, and saw the page I was on. His eyes hardened for a moment before turning to Miguel.

""You need to tell us exactly where you found that story.""

""I already told you, my cousin told me,"" Miguel replied.

""Then message him and ask where he got it from,"" Daniel insisted. ""We need to read the full version. She’s going to go crazy if she doesn’t know the whole thing... Look at her! She hasn’t eaten a bite and it’s her favorite food!""

Miguel frowned, but took out his phone and started typing. I took advantage of the pause to let out what had been gnawing at me inside.

""I received more calls,"" I said quietly.

Alejandra lifted her head sharply. Laura dropped her spoon.

""What?"" Alejandra asked.

""During the exam,"" I murmured. ""Several times.""

Daniel squinted.

""Probably it was your mom again, from her office.""

I shook my head.

""No. She knew I had the exam at that time. She wouldn’t call me then.""

Daniel didn’t seem convinced.

""Maybe there was an emergency.""

His logic was overwhelming, but something in my stomach told me no. Still, if I wanted peace of mind, there was a way to confirm it. I took my phone from his hand and searched the contact list.

""What are you doing?"" Laura asked.

""I'm going to call my mom. But to her cell, not the unknown number.""

If my mom really had forgotten her phone at home, then she wouldn’t answer. And that would mean that the calls from the unknown number had been made by her from her office. And that all of this had nothing to do with Miguel’s creepypasta. I swallowed and pressed call. The ringtone rang once. Then again. And then someone answered.

""Mom?"" I asked immediately.

Silence.

I frowned. The line didn’t sound normal. It wasn’t white noise, nor interference. It was... like someone was breathing very, very softly.

""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice coming out more tense than I intended.

Nothing.

""Why do you have my mom’s phone?"" I insisted.

More breathing. Something creaked in the background.

""Answer me!""

Then the voice changed. It was no longer the static whisper of a stranger. It was my voice... or something that sounded exactly like my voice.

""Tuesday 1:04 p.m.""

It wasn’t said with aggression or drama. It was just spoken, as if it were an absolute truth. A chill ran down my spine.

""What... what does that mean?""

But there was no answer. Just the dry sound of the call ending. I was left with the phone stuck to my ear, paralyzed.

""What happened?"" Laura asked urgently.

I didn’t respond. With trembling fingers, I called my mom’s number again. This time, the operator answered coldly:

""The number you have dialed is turned off or out of coverage.""

No.

No. No. No.

My friends stared at me in complete silence. I could barely breathe. I decided to do the only thing I could: call the unknown number that had been calling me during the exam. It rang twice.

""Hello?"" a woman’s voice answered.

It wasn’t my mom. It was an unknown woman, who let out a small laugh before speaking.

""Oh, sorry. Your mom is on her lunch break, that’s why she’s not in the office. But if you want, I can leave her a message. Or I can tell her to call you when she gets back.""

The knot in my stomach tightened.

""No... it’s not necessary. Just tell her we’ll see her at home.""

""Okay, I’ll let her know.""

I hung up.

My hands were trembling. I could feel the weight of all their stares on me.

""Who was that?"" Miguel asked.

""Someone from my mom’s office.""

""And what did she say?""

I swallowed.

""That my mom is on her lunch break.""

Nobody said anything. But I could see on their faces that they were all thinking the same thing. If my mom was at her office, having lunch, without her cell... then who had it?

""I don’t understand what’s happening,"" Alejandra whispered.

Neither did I.

I told them everything. That someone had answered my mom’s phone. That she hadn’t said anything until I demanded answers. That then... she spoke with my voice. That she gave me an exact date and time. That later I called my mom and her phone was off.

""This doesn’t make sense,"" Miguel said.

""It can’t be a coincidence,"" Laura whispered.

No one had answers. Not even Daniel. He, who always found the logical way out, was silent. Finally, it was him who spoke.

""The most logical explanation is that someone entered your house.""

His voice sounded tense, forced.

""Maybe a thief. Or a thief... since you said the voice was female. That would explain why someone answered your mom’s phone.""

""And my voice? Because that wasn’t just a female voice, it was my own voice, Daniel!"" I asked in a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer.

""And the day and time?"" I continued, feeling panic rise in my throat. ""Is it the exact moment when I’m going to die?""

Silence. Daniel couldn’t give me an answer. And that terrified me more than anything else.

Laura looked at all of us, still with the tension hanging in the air. It was clear she was trying to stay calm, even though her eyes reflected the same uncertainty we all felt.

""Listen,"" she finally said, ""we can’t keep speculating here and letting ourselves be carried away by panic. We need proof, something concrete.""

""And how are we supposed to do that?"" Miguel asked, crossing his arms.

""We’ll go to your house,"" Laura said, turning to me. ""If it really was a thief, we’ll know immediately. If the door is forced, if things are messed up, if something’s missing... that would confirm that someone entered and that the call you received was simply from someone who found your mom’s phone and answered it.""

""And if we don’t find anything..."" murmured Alejandra, without finishing the sentence.

Laura sighed.

""If we don’t find anything, we’ll think of another explanation. But at least we’ll rule one possibility out.""

I couldn’t oppose it. Deep down, I needed to see it with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I agreed. ""Let’s go.""

No one complained. They all understood that, after what had happened, I couldn’t go alone.",2,1741893826.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

A silence settled over the line.

“Right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.

Alejandra didn’t respond immediately.

I shuddered. For a moment, I imagined both of us mentally reviewing the past few days, trying to find a moment where we’d done something out of the ordinary, something that could have triggered this. But there was nothing. At least, nothing we remembered.

“We need to talk to Miguel,” I said finally. “If this is a joke, he’ll confess.”

“Yeah…” Alejandra whispered.

“Try to sleep, okay? We’ll clear this up tomorrow... well, later, when we meet at university.”

“I don’t think I can.”

I didn’t know how to respond. We stayed on the line a few more seconds before finally hanging up. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling. I tried to convince myself it was all nonsense, but the skin on my arms was still crawling. I couldn’t stop thinking about the time.

Thursday, 3:33 AM.

It was stupid, but I couldn’t help but check my phone screen. 3:57 AM. I swallowed and turned off the light. That night, I couldn’t sleep, drifting into what seemed like deep sleep, only to wake up suddenly. I checked my phone again. 4:38 AM. I’d be wasting my time if I tried to sleep. I had to leave now if I wanted to make it to the 7:00 AM class. I’d have to try to sleep a little on the bus.

That morning, we showed up with the faces of the sleepless. Alejandra looked pale, with furrowed brows, but didn’t say anything when she saw me. We just walked together to the faculty, in silence. We found Miguel in the courtyard, laughing with Daniel and Laura. Like nothing had happened. Like he hadn’t just played a sick prank on us. I crossed my arms and stood in front of him.

“Very funny, Miguel,” I said, without even greeting him.

He looked up, confused.

“Huh? Good morning, how are you? I’m good, thanks for asking,” he said in an ironic and playful tone.

Alejandra didn’t say anything, she just stayed a few steps behind me, lips tight.

“The call,” I said. “You can stop the show now.”

Miguel blinked.

“What call?”

I frowned.

“Come on, don’t play dumb. The 3:33 call. The creepypasta you told us. Alejandra got it last night.”

Laura and Daniel exchanged glances. Miguel, on the other hand, stood still.

“What?”

His tone didn’t sound like fake surprise. I didn’t like that.

“If this is a joke, you can stop now... because it’s not funny,” I warned.

“I’m not joking,” he said, quietly. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My stomach twisted. Alejandra tensed beside me.

“What do you mean ‘no idea’? You told us the story,” Alejandra whispered.

“Yeah, but…” Miguel scratched his neck, uneasy. “I just heard it from a cousin. I never said it was real.”

An uncomfortable silence settled between us.

“Okay, calm down,” Daniel said, raising his hands. “If Miguel didn’t do it, then someone’s messing with you. Couldn’t it just be some random guy with too much free time?”

“How can it be random if the voice I heard was mine?” Alejandra snapped.

We all fell silent. Miguel rubbed his hands together nervously.

“Look... if this is real,” he said quietly, “the story I heard said something else.”

Alejandra and I looked at him, tense.

“If you get the call and answer... there’s no way to avoid it.”

The air seemed to thicken.

“That’s stupid,” I said, trying to laugh, but my voice sounded hollow.

“That’s what the story said,” Miguel insisted, looking at us seriously. “And there’s more.”

We waited.

“If Alejandra answered… she won’t be the only one to get the call.”

A chill ran down my spine. I slowly turned to Alejandra, but she was already looking at me, wide-eyed. Daniel broke the silence with a nervous laugh.

“Well, then it’s easy. No one answers calls from 'Unknown,' and that’s it.”

“And if you don’t have a choice?” Alejandra asked, in a whisper.

I didn’t understand what she meant until my phone vibrated in my pocket. I felt a cold jolt in my chest. I pulled the phone out with trembling fingers. On the screen, there was no number. Just one word.

Unknown.

The phone kept vibrating in my hand. Fear gripped my chest, freezing my fingers.

“Don’t answer,” Alejandra whispered, wide-eyed.

Laura and Daniel looked at us, frowning, waiting for me to do something. Miguel, however, looked too serious, as if he already knew what was going to happen. I swallowed. It was just a call. Nothing more. If I didn’t answer, I’d just be feeding the irrational fear that Miguel had planted with his stupid story. I had to show Alejandra nothing was going to happen. But my hands trembled. The buzzing of the phone seemed to reverberate in my bones.

“Don’t do it…” Alejandra insisted, grabbing my arm.

I swallowed. And I answered.

“H-Hello?”

Nothing. White noise. A soft, intermittent sound, like someone breathing on the other side of the line. A chill ran down my spine.

I looked at my friends, wide-eyed. Miguel watched me, tense, as if waiting for the worst. Laura and Daniel stared at me, holding their breath. Alejandra shook her head, terrified. I wanted to hang up too. I needed to. I moved my finger toward the screen. And then, a familiar voice broke the silence.

“Hello? Sweetheart?”

I felt deflated. It was my mom. I put a hand to my chest, releasing the air I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.

“Mom...” my voice came out shaky. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing, honey. You left your phone on the table, and I noticed when I got to the office. I’m calling you from here. Everything okay?”

I couldn't believe it. I turned to Alejandra and the others with a trembling smile. I sighed, feeling ridiculous for being so scared.

""Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.""

""Well, see you at home. Don't forget to buy what I asked for.""

""Yeah... okay.""

I hung up and let my arm drop, suddenly feeling exhausted. I turned to my friends.

""It was my mom.""

Alejandra's shoulders slumped. Daniel and Laura exchanged glances and laughed in relief.

""I knew it,"" Daniel said, shaking his head. ""We're overthinking this.""

Alejandra still looked tense, but she let out a sigh.

""God... I swear, I thought that...""

""That what?"" I interrupted, smiling. ""That a curse fell on us just because Miguel told us an internet story?""

Alejandra didn’t answer. Miguel, however, was still staring at me, frowning.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

He took a while to respond.

""Did your mom call you from her office?""

""Yeah... why?""

Miguel squinted.

""Then why did it say 'Unknown' on the screen?""

The relief evaporated in my chest. I froze.

""What...?""

I looked at the phone screen. The call wasn’t in the history. The fear hit me again, hard. Alejandra put a hand over her mouth. Daniel and Laura stopped smiling. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Because the last thing my mom said before hanging up... was that I had forgotten my phone at home.

But it was in my hand.

The silence grew thick. No one spoke.

I looked at my phone screen, my fingers stiff around it. It wasn’t in the call history. There was no record of me answering. And my mom’s voice… I swallowed.

""I... I heard her. I'm sure she said I left the phone at home.""

Alejandra shifted uncomfortably beside me, crossing her arms over her chest.

""But... you have it in your hand.""

My stomach churned.

""Maybe you just misunderstood,"" Daniel interjected, with his logical tone, as if he were explaining a simple math problem. ""You said you were nervous, and you were. Your mom probably said she left the phone on the table. That she left it at home, not your phone.""

I stared at him.

""You think I imagined it?""

""I’m not saying you imagined it, just that you interpreted it wrong. It's normal."" Daniel waved his hand. ""The brain tends to fill in information when it’s in an anxious state. Sometimes we hear what we’re afraid to hear.""

Alejandra nodded slowly, as if trying to convince herself he was right. Laura, on the other hand, still had her lips pursed.

""But the call history..."" she murmured.

""That is strange,"" Daniel admitted, ""but there are logical explanations. It could’ve been a glitch, or the number was hidden. There are apps that allow that.""

""And the white noise?"" Alejandra interrupted.

Daniel shrugged.

""Bad signal. My point is, if your mom called, that's the important part. All the rest are details that were exaggerated because we were scared.""

I crossed my arms. I wanted to believe him. I wanted him to be right. But something in my stomach wouldn’t let go. Miguel, who had been quiet up until now, rubbed his chin.

""Maybe it’s just that... or maybe it’s already started.""

Alejandra shot him a sharp look.

""Miguel!""

He shrugged with a half-smile, but didn’t seem as relaxed as he tried to appear.

""I’m just saying.""

Daniel scoffed.

""Stop saying nonsense.""

I looked at my phone again, my heart pounding. Maybe Daniel was right. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, it vibrated again in my hand. Unknown number.

I ignored the call. I didn’t even say anything to the others. I just blocked the screen, put my phone in my bag, and pretended nothing had happened. That everything was fine. I had a physiology exam to do. I couldn’t lose my mind now. But as soon as I sat in the classroom and saw the paper in front of me, I knew I couldn’t concentrate. The questions were there, waiting for answers I would’ve known by heart at another time. ""Why does a boa’s heart rate and ventilation decrease after hunting? What are the implications for its metabolism?""

I had no idea. Because my mind wasn’t here. I could only think about the call. About the word “Unknown” glowing on my screen. About the possibility that, at this very moment, my phone was vibrating inside my bag.

I tried to focus. I took a breath. I answered a few things with whatever my brain could piece together. But when time was up and they collected the papers, I knew my result would be disastrous.

We left in silence. Alejandra walked beside me with a frown, but didn’t say anything. Maybe she hadn’t done well either. When we reached the cafeteria, hunger hit all of us at the same time. A black hole in our stomachs. We had an hour before the lab, and if we didn’t eat now, we wouldn’t eat later.

We ordered food, sat at our usual table, and for a moment, the world felt normal again. Until I took out my phone. And saw the five missed calls. All from the same unknown number.

I didn’t eat.

While the others devoured their meals, I was completely absorbed in the screen of my phone. I needed to find the story.

I searched by keywords: mysterious call, unknown number, phone creepypasta, cursed night call, call at 3:33 a.m. Click after click, I entered forums, horror story websites, blogs with strange fonts and dark backgrounds. I read story after story, but none matched exactly what Miguel had told us that day. Something told me that if I understood the story well, if I found its origin, we could do something to get away from it. To prevent it from becoming our reality.

Everything around me became a distant murmur, background noise without importance. Until a hand appeared out of nowhere and snatched the phone from me. I blinked, surprised. Daniel was looking at me with a mix of pity and understanding.

""Seriously?"" he said, holding the phone as if he had just caught me in the middle of a madness.

I didn’t respond. Daniel sighed, swiped his finger across the screen, and saw the page I was on. His eyes hardened for a moment before turning to Miguel.

""You need to tell us exactly where you found that story.""

""I already told you, my cousin told me,"" Miguel replied.

""Then message him and ask where he got it from,"" Daniel insisted. ""We need to read the full version. She’s going to go crazy if she doesn’t know the whole thing... Look at her! She hasn’t eaten a bite and it’s her favorite food!""

Miguel frowned, but took out his phone and started typing. I took advantage of the pause to let out what had been gnawing at me inside.

""I received more calls,"" I said quietly.

Alejandra lifted her head sharply. Laura dropped her spoon.

""What?"" Alejandra asked.

""During the exam,"" I murmured. ""Several times.""

Daniel squinted.

""Probably it was your mom again, from her office.""

I shook my head.

""No. She knew I had the exam at that time. She wouldn’t call me then.""

Daniel didn’t seem convinced.

""Maybe there was an emergency.""

His logic was overwhelming, but something in my stomach told me no. Still, if I wanted peace of mind, there was a way to confirm it. I took my phone from his hand and searched the contact list.

""What are you doing?"" Laura asked.

""I'm going to call my mom. But to her cell, not the unknown number.""

If my mom really had forgotten her phone at home, then she wouldn’t answer. And that would mean that the calls from the unknown number had been made by her from her office. And that all of this had nothing to do with Miguel’s creepypasta. I swallowed and pressed call. The ringtone rang once. Then again. And then someone answered.

""Mom?"" I asked immediately.

Silence.

I frowned. The line didn’t sound normal. It wasn’t white noise, nor interference. It was... like someone was breathing very, very softly.

""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice coming out more tense than I intended.

Nothing.

""Why do you have my mom’s phone?"" I insisted.

More breathing. Something creaked in the background.

""Answer me!""

Then the voice changed. It was no longer the static whisper of a stranger. It was my voice... or something that sounded exactly like my voice.

""Tuesday 1:04 p.m.""

It wasn’t said with aggression or drama. It was just spoken, as if it were an absolute truth. A chill ran down my spine.

""What... what does that mean?""

But there was no answer. Just the dry sound of the call ending. I was left with the phone stuck to my ear, paralyzed.

""What happened?"" Laura asked urgently.

I didn’t respond. With trembling fingers, I called my mom’s number again. This time, the operator answered coldly:

""The number you have dialed is turned off or out of coverage.""

No.

No. No. No.

My friends stared at me in complete silence. I could barely breathe. I decided to do the only thing I could: call the unknown number that had been calling me during the exam. It rang twice.

""Hello?"" a woman’s voice answered.

It wasn’t my mom. It was an unknown woman, who let out a small laugh before speaking.

""Oh, sorry. Your mom is on her lunch break, that’s why she’s not in the office. But if you want, I can leave her a message. Or I can tell her to call you when she gets back.""

The knot in my stomach tightened.

""No... it’s not necessary. Just tell her we’ll see her at home.""

""Okay, I’ll let her know.""

I hung up.

My hands were trembling. I could feel the weight of all their stares on me.

""Who was that?"" Miguel asked.

""Someone from my mom’s office.""

""And what did she say?""

I swallowed.

""That my mom is on her lunch break.""

Nobody said anything. But I could see on their faces that they were all thinking the same thing. If my mom was at her office, having lunch, without her cell... then who had it?

""I don’t understand what’s happening,"" Alejandra whispered.

Neither did I.

I told them everything. That someone had answered my mom’s phone. That she hadn’t said anything until I demanded answers. That then... she spoke with my voice. That she gave me an exact date and time. That later I called my mom and her phone was off.

""This doesn’t make sense,"" Miguel said.

""It can’t be a coincidence,"" Laura whispered.

No one had answers. Not even Daniel. He, who always found the logical way out, was silent. Finally, it was him who spoke.

""The most logical explanation is that someone entered your house.""

His voice sounded tense, forced.

""Maybe a thief. Or a thief... since you said the voice was female. That would explain why someone answered your mom’s phone.""

""And my voice? Because that wasn’t just a female voice, it was my own voice, Daniel!"" I asked in a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer.

""And the day and time?"" I continued, feeling panic rise in my throat. ""Is it the exact moment when I’m going to die?""

Silence. Daniel couldn’t give me an answer. And that terrified me more than anything else.

Laura looked at all of us, still with the tension hanging in the air. It was clear she was trying to stay calm, even though her eyes reflected the same uncertainty we all felt.

""Listen,"" she finally said, ""we can’t keep speculating here and letting ourselves be carried away by panic. We need proof, something concrete.""

""And how are we supposed to do that?"" Miguel asked, crossing his arms.

""We’ll go to your house,"" Laura said, turning to me. ""If it really was a thief, we’ll know immediately. If the door is forced, if things are messed up, if something’s missing... that would confirm that someone entered and that the call you received was simply from someone who found your mom’s phone and answered it.""

""And if we don’t find anything..."" murmured Alejandra, without finishing the sentence.

Laura sighed.

""If we don’t find anything, we’ll think of another explanation. But at least we’ll rule one possibility out.""

I couldn’t oppose it. Deep down, I needed to see it with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I agreed. ""Let’s go.""

No one complained. They all understood that, after what had happened, I couldn’t go alone.",2,1741893810.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jakbey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1jakbey/minute_64/,Minute 64,"I always thought urban legends were just that: stories to scare us and make us lose sleep for no reason. As a biology student, I got used to looking for rational explanations for everything, even when something made me uneasy. But what happened to my friends and me that semester is still the only thing I haven’t been able to explain.

It all started one Friday afternoon, after a field practice. We had gathered in the faculty cafeteria to rest before heading home. Miguel, as usual, brought up a strange topic.

“Have you ever heard of the 'Night Call Syndrome'?” he asked, absentmindedly stirring his coffee.

Laura snorted, skeptical. “Let me guess. A creepypasta?”

“Kind of,” Miguel said with a smile. “They say some people get a call at 3:33 AM. The number doesn’t show up on the screen, just 'Unknown.' If you answer, at first you just hear noise, like someone breathing on the other side. But if you stay on the line long enough... you hear your own voice.”

A chill ran down my spine. Alejandra, who had been distracted with her phone until that moment, looked up.

“And what’s that voice supposed to say?” she asked.

Miguel put his cup down and leaned toward us.

“They say it tells you the exact time you’re going to die.”

Daniel burst out laughing. “How convenient. A death call that only happens at 3:33. Why not at 4:44 or something more dramatic?”

We laughed because that made sense. It was an absurd story, something told to make us uneasy, but nothing more.

“Come on, genetics class is about to start, and I don’t want Camilo to give us that hawk stare for walking in late,” I said, annoyed.

“Hurry up, I can’t miss genetics! I refuse to see that class with that guy again,” Miguel said, half worried, half annoyed.

We really hated the genetics class. It wasn’t the subject itself; it was... Camilo. He was the professor in charge, and he didn’t make things easy or comfortable for us. We grabbed our things and headed to class, hoping to understand at least something of what that teacher said.

In the following days, the conversation about the night call was forgotten. We had exams coming up, lab practices, and an ecology report that was driving us crazy. But then, five nights after that conversation, something happened.

It was almost four in the morning when my phone vibrated on the nightstand. I woke up startled and, still groggy, squinted at the screen. It was a message from Alejandra.

""Are you awake?""

I frowned. It wasn’t unusual for Alejandra to stay up late, but she never texted me at this hour. I replied with a simple ""What’s up?"" Almost immediately, the three dots appeared, indicating she was typing.

“They called me.”

I felt a void in my stomach. “Who?” I typed with trembling fingers.

“I don’t know. No number showed up. It just said 'Unknown.'”

I stared at the screen, waiting for more, but Alejandra stopped typing. The silence of the night became heavy, like the room had shrunk around me.

“Did you answer?” I finally wrote.

A few eternal seconds passed before her response came.

“Yes.”

The air caught in my throat.

“And what did you hear?”

The three dots appeared again, but this time they took longer. When her response finally arrived, it gave me chills.

“My voice. It said my name. And then... it told me an exact time.”

My heart started pounding. I sat up abruptly, turned on the light, and dialed her number. It rang three times before she answered.

“Ale, tell me this is a joke,” I whispered.

There was a brief silence before she spoke. She sounded scared.

“I’m not joking. They told me a date and time: Thursday at 3:33 AM. And it was my voice, my own voice!”

My skin crawled. Thursday was only two days away. I stayed silent, the phone pressed to my ear. I wanted to say something, anything that would calm Alejandra, but I couldn’t find the words. Her breathing was shallow, as if she was on the verge of a panic attack.

“Ale, this has to be a joke,” I finally said, trying to sound firm.

“That’s what I thought…” Her voice trembled. “I want to think someone’s messing with me, but... I felt something. It wasn’t just a call, it wasn’t static noise. It was my voice. And it sounded so sure when it said the time…”

I ran a hand over my face, trying to shake off the numbness of the early morning.

“It has to be Miguel,” I blurted. “He was the one who told us that story, he’s probably messing with us.”

Alejandra took a moment to respond.

“Yeah… I guess so,” she said, but she didn’t sound convinced.

“Think about it,” I insisted. “In all those stories, there’s a trigger, something people do to activate the curse or whatever. In creepypastas, there’s always a ritual, a cursed website, a mirror at midnight, touching a forbidden object, selling your soul to the devil, something! But we didn’t do anything.”

A silence settled over the line.

“Right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.

Alejandra didn’t respond immediately.

I shuddered. For a moment, I imagined both of us mentally reviewing the past few days, trying to find a moment where we’d done something out of the ordinary, something that could have triggered this. But there was nothing. At least, nothing we remembered.

“We need to talk to Miguel,” I said finally. “If this is a joke, he’ll confess.”

“Yeah…” Alejandra whispered.

“Try to sleep, okay? We’ll clear this up tomorrow... well, later, when we meet at university.”

“I don’t think I can.”

I didn’t know how to respond. We stayed on the line a few more seconds before finally hanging up. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling. I tried to convince myself it was all nonsense, but the skin on my arms was still crawling. I couldn’t stop thinking about the time.

That night, I couldn’t sleep, drifting into what seemed like deep sleep, only to wake up suddenly. I checked my phone again. 4:38 AM. I’d be wasting my time if I tried to sleep.

“What call?”

I frowned.

“Come on, don’t play dumb. The 3:33 call. The creepypasta you told us. Alejandra got it last night.”

Laura and Daniel exchanged glances. Miguel, on the other hand, stood still.

“If this is a joke, you can stop now... because it’s not funny,” I warned.

""Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.""

""Well, see you at home. Don't forget to buy what I asked for.""

""Yeah... okay.""

I hung up and let my arm drop, suddenly feeling exhausted. I turned to my friends.

""It was my mom.""

Alejandra's shoulders slumped. Daniel and Laura exchanged glances and laughed in relief.

""I knew it,"" Daniel said, shaking his head. ""We're overthinking this.""

Alejandra still looked tense, but she let out a sigh.

""God... I swear, I thought that...""

I crossed my arms. I wanted to believe him. I wanted him to be right. But something in my stomach wouldn’t let go. Miguel, who had been quiet up until now, rubbed his chin.

""Maybe it’s just that... or maybe it’s already started.""

Alejandra shot him a sharp look.

""Miguel!""

He shrugged with a half-smile, but didn’t seem as relaxed as he tried to appear.

""I’m just saying.""

Daniel scoffed.

""Stop saying nonsense.""

I looked at my phone again, my heart pounding. Maybe Daniel was right. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, it vibrated again in my hand. Unknown number.

I ignored the call. I didn’t even say anything to the others. I just blocked the screen, put my phone in my bag, and pretended nothing had happened. That everything was fine. I had a physiology exam to do. I couldn’t lose my mind now. But as soon as I sat in the classroom and saw the paper in front of me, I knew I couldn’t concentrate. The questions were there, waiting for answers I would’ve known by heart at another time. ""Why does a boa’s heart rate and ventilation decrease after hunting? What are the implications for its metabolism?""

I had no idea. Because my mind wasn’t here. I could only think about the call. About the word “Unknown” glowing on my screen. About the possibility that, at this very moment, my phone was vibrating inside my bag.

I tried to focus. I took a breath. I answered a few things with whatever my brain could piece together. But when time was up and they collected the papers, I knew my result would be disastrous.

We left in silence. Alejandra walked beside me with a frown, but didn’t say anything. Maybe she hadn’t done well either. When we reached the cafeteria, hunger hit all of us at the same time. A black hole in our stomachs. We had an hour before the lab, and if we didn’t eat now, we wouldn’t eat later.

We ordered food, sat at our usual table, and for a moment, the world felt normal again. Until I took out my phone. And saw the five missed calls. All from the same unknown number.

I didn’t eat.

While the others devoured their meals, I was completely absorbed in the screen of my phone. I needed to find the story.

I searched by keywords: mysterious call, unknown number, phone creepypasta, cursed night call, call at 3:33 a.m. Click after click, I entered forums, horror story websites, blogs with strange fonts and dark backgrounds. I read story after story, but none matched exactly what Miguel had told us that day. Something told me that if I understood the story well, if I found its origin, we could do something to get away from it. To prevent it from becoming our reality.

Everything around me became a distant murmur, background noise without importance. Until a hand appeared out of nowhere and snatched the phone from me. I blinked, surprised. Daniel was looking at me with a mix of pity and understanding.

""Seriously?"" he said, holding the phone as if he had just caught me in the middle of a madness.

I didn’t respond. Daniel sighed, swiped his finger across the screen, and saw the page I was on. His eyes hardened for a moment before turning to Miguel.

""You need to tell us exactly where you found that story.""

""I already told you, my cousin told me,"" Miguel replied.

""Then message him and ask where he got it from,"" Daniel insisted. ""We need to read the full version. She’s going to go crazy if she doesn’t know the whole thing... Look at her! She hasn’t eaten a bite and it’s her favorite food!""

Miguel frowned, but took out his phone and started typing. I took advantage of the pause to let out what had been gnawing at me inside.

""I received more calls,"" I said quietly.

Alejandra lifted her head sharply. Laura dropped her spoon.

""What?"" Alejandra asked.

""During the exam,"" I murmured. ""Several times.""

Daniel squinted.

""Probably it was your mom again, from her office.""

I shook my head.

""No. She knew I had the exam at that time. She wouldn’t call me then.""

Daniel didn’t seem convinced.

""Maybe there was an emergency.""

His logic was overwhelming, but something in my stomach told me no. Still, if I wanted peace of mind, there was a way to confirm it. I took my phone from his hand and searched the contact list.

""What are you doing?"" Laura asked.

""I'm going to call my mom. But to her cell, not the unknown number.""

If my mom really had forgotten her phone at home, then she wouldn’t answer. And that would mean that the calls from the unknown number had been made by her from her office. And that all of this had nothing to do with Miguel’s creepypasta. I swallowed and pressed call. The ringtone rang once. Then again. And then someone answered.

""Mom?"" I asked immediately.

Silence.

I frowned. The line didn’t sound normal. It wasn’t white noise, nor interference. It was... like someone was breathing very, very softly.

""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice coming out more tense than I intended.

Nothing.

""Why do you have my mom’s phone?"" I insisted.

More breathing. Something creaked in the background.

""Answer me!""

Then the voice changed. It was no longer the static whisper of a stranger. It was my voice... or something that sounded exactly like my voice.

""Tuesday 1:04 p.m.""

It wasn’t said with aggression or drama. It was just spoken, as if it were an absolute truth. A chill ran down my spine.

""What... what does that mean?""

But there was no answer. Just the dry sound of the call ending. I was left with the phone stuck to my ear, paralyzed.

""What happened?"" Laura asked urgently.

I didn’t respond. With trembling fingers, I called my mom’s number again. This time, the operator answered coldly:

""The number you have dialed is turned off or out of coverage.""

No.

No. No. No.

My friends stared at me in complete silence. I could barely breathe. I decided to do the only thing I could: call the unknown number that had been calling me during the exam. It rang twice.

""Hello?"" a woman’s voice answered.

It wasn’t my mom. It was an unknown woman, who let out a small laugh before speaking.

""Oh, sorry. Your mom is on her lunch break, that’s why she’s not in the office. But if you want, I can leave her a message. Or I can tell her to call you when she gets back.""

The knot in my stomach tightened.

""No... it’s not necessary. Just tell her we’ll see her at home.""

""Okay, I’ll let her know.""

I hung up.

My hands were trembling. I could feel the weight of all their stares on me.

""Who was that?"" Miguel asked.

""Someone from my mom’s office.""

""And what did she say?""

I swallowed.

""That my mom is on her lunch break.""

Nobody said anything. But I could see on their faces that they were all thinking the same thing. If my mom was at her office, having lunch, without her cell... then who had it?

""I don’t understand what’s happening,"" Alejandra whispered.

Neither did I.

I told them everything. That someone had answered my mom’s phone. That she hadn’t said anything until I demanded answers. That then... she spoke with my voice. That she gave me an exact date and time. That later I called my mom and her phone was off.

""This doesn’t make sense,"" Miguel said.

""It can’t be a coincidence,"" Laura whispered.

No one had answers. Not even Daniel. He, who always found the logical way out, was silent. Finally, it was him who spoke.

""The most logical explanation is that someone entered your house.""

His voice sounded tense, forced.

""Maybe a thief. Or a thief... since you said the voice was female. That would explain why someone answered your mom’s phone.""

""And my voice? Because that wasn’t just a female voice, it was my own voice, Daniel!"" I asked in a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer.

""And the day and time?"" I continued, feeling panic rise in my throat. ""Is it the exact moment when I’m going to die?""

Silence. Daniel couldn’t give me an answer. And that terrified me more than anything else.

Laura looked at all of us, still with the tension hanging in the air. It was clear she was trying to stay calm, even though her eyes reflected the same uncertainty we all felt.

""Listen,"" she finally said, ""we can’t keep speculating here and letting ourselves be carried away by panic. We need proof, something concrete.""

""And how are we supposed to do that?"" Miguel asked, crossing his arms.

""We’ll go to your house,"" Laura said, turning to me. ""If it really was a thief, we’ll know immediately. If the door is forced, if things are messed up, if something’s missing... that would confirm that someone entered and that the call you received was simply from someone who found your mom’s phone and answered it.""

""And if we don’t find anything..."" murmured Alejandra, without finishing the sentence.

Laura sighed.

""If we don’t find anything, we’ll think of another explanation. But at least we’ll rule one possibility out.""

I couldn’t oppose it. Deep down, I needed to see it with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I agreed. ""Let’s go.""

No one complained. They all understood that, after what had happened, I couldn’t go alone.",1,1741893783.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False
1jakaha,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1jakaha/minute_64/,Minute 64,"I always thought urban legends were just that: stories to scare us and make us lose sleep for no reason. As a biology student, I got used to looking for rational explanations for everything, even when something made me uneasy. But what happened to my friends and me that semester is still the only thing I haven’t been able to explain.

It all started one Friday afternoon, after a field practice. We had gathered in the faculty cafeteria to rest before heading home. Miguel, as usual, brought up a strange topic.

“Have you ever heard of the 'Night Call Syndrome'?” he asked, absentmindedly stirring his coffee.

Laura snorted, skeptical. “Let me guess. A creepypasta?”

“Kind of,” Miguel said with a smile. “They say some people get a call at 3:33 AM. The number doesn’t show up on the screen, just 'Unknown.' If you answer, at first you just hear noise, like someone breathing on the other side. But if you stay on the line long enough... you hear your own voice.”

A chill ran down my spine. Alejandra, who had been distracted with her phone until that moment, looked up.

“And what’s that voice supposed to say?” she asked.

Miguel put his cup down and leaned toward us.

“They say it tells you the exact time you’re going to die.”

Daniel burst out laughing. “How convenient. A death call that only happens at 3:33. Why not at 4:44 or something more dramatic?”

We laughed because that made sense. It was an absurd story, something told to make us uneasy, but nothing more.

“Come on, genetics class is about to start, and I don’t want Camilo to give us that hawk stare for walking in late,” I said, annoyed.

“Hurry up, I can’t miss genetics! I refuse to see that class with that guy again,” Miguel said, half worried, half annoyed.

We really hated the genetics class. It wasn’t the subject itself; it was... Camilo. He was the professor in charge, and he didn’t make things easy or comfortable for us. We grabbed our things and headed to class, hoping to understand at least something of what that teacher said.

In the following days, the conversation about the night call was forgotten. We had exams coming up, lab practices, and an ecology report that was driving us crazy. But then, five nights after that conversation, something happened.

It was almost four in the morning when my phone vibrated on the nightstand. I woke up startled and, still groggy, squinted at the screen. It was a message from Alejandra.

""Are you awake?""

I frowned. It wasn’t unusual for Alejandra to stay up late, but she never texted me at this hour. I replied with a simple ""What’s up?"" Almost immediately, the three dots appeared, indicating she was typing.

“They called me.”

I felt a void in my stomach. “Who?” I typed with trembling fingers.

“I don’t know. No number showed up. It just said 'Unknown.'”

I stared at the screen, waiting for more, but Alejandra stopped typing. The silence of the night became heavy, like the room had shrunk around me.

“Did you answer?” I finally wrote.

A few eternal seconds passed before her response came.

“Yes.”

The air caught in my throat.

“And what did you hear?”

The three dots appeared again, but this time they took longer. When her response finally arrived, it gave me chills.

“My voice. It said my name. And then... it told me an exact time.”

My heart started pounding. I sat up abruptly, turned on the light, and dialed her number. It rang three times before she answered.

“Ale, tell me this is a joke,” I whispered.

There was a brief silence before she spoke. She sounded scared.

“I’m not joking. They told me a date and time: Thursday at 3:33 AM. And it was my voice, my own voice!”

My skin crawled. Thursday was only two days away. I stayed silent, the phone pressed to my ear. I wanted to say something, anything that would calm Alejandra, but I couldn’t find the words. Her breathing was shallow, as if she was on the verge of a panic attack.

“Ale, this has to be a joke,” I finally said, trying to sound firm.

“That’s what I thought…” Her voice trembled. “I want to think someone’s messing with me, but... I felt something. It wasn’t just a call, it wasn’t static noise. It was my voice. And it sounded so sure when it said the time…”

I ran a hand over my face, trying to shake off the numbness of the early morning.

“It has to be Miguel,” I blurted. “He was the one who told us that story, he’s probably messing with us.”

Alejandra took a moment to respond.

“Yeah… I guess so,” she said, but she didn’t sound convinced.

“Think about it,” I insisted. “In all those stories, there’s a trigger, something people do to activate the curse or whatever. In creepypastas, there’s always a ritual, a cursed website, a mirror at midnight, touching a forbidden object, selling your soul to the devil, something! But we didn’t do anything.”

A silence settled over the line.

“Right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.

Alejandra didn’t respond immediately.

I shuddered. For a moment, I imagined both of us mentally reviewing the past few days, trying to find a moment where we’d done something out of the ordinary, something that could have triggered this. But there was nothing. At least, nothing we remembered.

“We need to talk to Miguel,” I said finally. “If this is a joke, he’ll confess.”

“Yeah…” Alejandra whispered.

“Try to sleep, okay? We’ll clear this up tomorrow... well, later, when we meet at university.”

“I don’t think I can.”

I didn’t know how to respond. We stayed on the line a few more seconds before finally hanging up. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling. I tried to convince myself it was all nonsense, but the skin on my arms was still crawling. I couldn’t stop thinking about the time.

Thursday, 3:33 AM.

It was stupid, but I couldn’t help but check my phone screen. 3:57 AM. I swallowed and turned off the light. That night, I couldn’t sleep, drifting into what seemed like deep sleep, only to wake up suddenly. I checked my phone again. 4:38 AM. I’d be wasting my time if I tried to sleep. I had to leave now if I wanted to make it to the 7:00 AM class. I’d have to try to sleep a little on the bus.

That morning, we showed up with the faces of the sleepless. Alejandra looked pale, with furrowed brows, but didn’t say anything when she saw me. We just walked together to the faculty, in silence. We found Miguel in the courtyard, laughing with Daniel and Laura. Like nothing had happened. Like he hadn’t just played a sick prank on us. I crossed my arms and stood in front of him.

“Very funny, Miguel,” I said, without even greeting him.

He looked up, confused.

“Huh? Good morning, how are you? I’m good, thanks for asking,” he said in an ironic and playful tone.

Alejandra didn’t say anything, she just stayed a few steps behind me, lips tight.

“The call,” I said. “You can stop the show now.”

Miguel blinked.

“What call?”

I frowned.

“Come on, don’t play dumb. The 3:33 call. The creepypasta you told us. Alejandra got it last night.”

Laura and Daniel exchanged glances. Miguel, on the other hand, stood still.

“What?”

His tone didn’t sound like fake surprise. I didn’t like that.

“If this is a joke, you can stop now... because it’s not funny,” I warned.

“I’m not joking,” he said, quietly. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My stomach twisted. Alejandra tensed beside me.

“What do you mean ‘no idea’? You told us the story,” Alejandra whispered.

“Yeah, but…” Miguel scratched his neck, uneasy. “I just heard it from a cousin. I never said it was real.”

An uncomfortable silence settled between us.

“Okay, calm down,” Daniel said, raising his hands. “If Miguel didn’t do it, then someone’s messing with you. Couldn’t it just be some random guy with too much free time?”

“How can it be random if the voice I heard was mine?” Alejandra snapped.

We all fell silent. Miguel rubbed his hands together nervously.

“Look... if this is real,” he said quietly, “the story I heard said something else.”

Alejandra and I looked at him, tense.

“If you get the call and answer... there’s no way to avoid it.”

The air seemed to thicken.

“That’s stupid,” I said, trying to laugh, but my voice sounded hollow.

“That’s what the story said,” Miguel insisted, looking at us seriously. “And there’s more.”

We waited.

“If Alejandra answered… she won’t be the only one to get the call.”

A chill ran down my spine. I slowly turned to Alejandra, but she was already looking at me, wide-eyed. Daniel broke the silence with a nervous laugh.

“Well, then it’s easy. No one answers calls from 'Unknown,' and that’s it.”

“And if you don’t have a choice?” Alejandra asked, in a whisper.

I didn’t understand what she meant until my phone vibrated in my pocket. I felt a cold jolt in my chest. I pulled the phone out with trembling fingers. On the screen, there was no number. Just one word.

Unknown.

The phone kept vibrating in my hand. Fear gripped my chest, freezing my fingers.

“Don’t answer,” Alejandra whispered, wide-eyed.

Laura and Daniel looked at us, frowning, waiting for me to do something. Miguel, however, looked too serious, as if he already knew what was going to happen. I swallowed. It was just a call. Nothing more. If I didn’t answer, I’d just be feeding the irrational fear that Miguel had planted with his stupid story. I had to show Alejandra nothing was going to happen. But my hands trembled. The buzzing of the phone seemed to reverberate in my bones.

“Don’t do it…” Alejandra insisted, grabbing my arm.

I swallowed. And I answered.

“H-Hello?”

Nothing. White noise. A soft, intermittent sound, like someone breathing on the other side of the line. A chill ran down my spine.

I looked at my friends, wide-eyed. Miguel watched me, tense, as if waiting for the worst. Laura and Daniel stared at me, holding their breath. Alejandra shook her head, terrified. I wanted to hang up too. I needed to. I moved my finger toward the screen. And then, a familiar voice broke the silence.

“Hello? Sweetheart?”

I felt deflated. It was my mom. I put a hand to my chest, releasing the air I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.

“Mom...” my voice came out shaky. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing, honey. You left your phone on the table, and I noticed when I got to the office. I’m calling you from here. Everything okay?”

I couldn't believe it. I turned to Alejandra and the others with a trembling smile. I sighed, feeling ridiculous for being so scared.

""Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.""

""Well, see you at home. Don't forget to buy what I asked for.""

""Yeah... okay.""

I hung up and let my arm drop, suddenly feeling exhausted. I turned to my friends.

""It was my mom.""

Alejandra's shoulders slumped. Daniel and Laura exchanged glances and laughed in relief.

""I knew it,"" Daniel said, shaking his head. ""We're overthinking this.""

Alejandra still looked tense, but she let out a sigh.

""God... I swear, I thought that...""

""That what?"" I interrupted, smiling. ""That a curse fell on us just because Miguel told us an internet story?""

Alejandra didn’t answer. Miguel, however, was still staring at me, frowning.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

He took a while to respond.

""Did your mom call you from her office?""

""Yeah... why?""

Miguel squinted.

""Then why did it say 'Unknown' on the screen?""

The relief evaporated in my chest. I froze.

""What...?""

I looked at the phone screen. The call wasn’t in the history. The fear hit me again, hard. Alejandra put a hand over her mouth. Daniel and Laura stopped smiling. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Because the last thing my mom said before hanging up... was that I had forgotten my phone at home.

But it was in my hand.

The silence grew thick. No one spoke.

I looked at my phone screen, my fingers stiff around it. It wasn’t in the call history. There was no record of me answering. And my mom’s voice… I swallowed.

""I... I heard her. I'm sure she said I left the phone at home.""

Alejandra shifted uncomfortably beside me, crossing her arms over her chest.

""But... you have it in your hand.""

My stomach churned.

""Maybe you just misunderstood,"" Daniel interjected, with his logical tone, as if he were explaining a simple math problem. ""You said you were nervous, and you were. Your mom probably said she left the phone on the table. That she left it at home, not your phone.""

I stared at him.

""You think I imagined it?""

""I’m not saying you imagined it, just that you interpreted it wrong. It's normal."" Daniel waved his hand. ""The brain tends to fill in information when it’s in an anxious state. Sometimes we hear what we’re afraid to hear.""

Alejandra nodded slowly, as if trying to convince herself he was right. Laura, on the other hand, still had her lips pursed.

""But the call history..."" she murmured.

""That is strange,"" Daniel admitted, ""but there are logical explanations. It could’ve been a glitch, or the number was hidden. There are apps that allow that.""

""And the white noise?"" Alejandra interrupted.

Daniel shrugged.

""Bad signal. My point is, if your mom called, that's the important part. All the rest are details that were exaggerated because we were scared.""

I crossed my arms. I wanted to believe him. I wanted him to be right. But something in my stomach wouldn’t let go. Miguel, who had been quiet up until now, rubbed his chin.

""Maybe it’s just that... or maybe it’s already started.""

Alejandra shot him a sharp look.

""Miguel!""

He shrugged with a half-smile, but didn’t seem as relaxed as he tried to appear.

""I’m just saying.""

Daniel scoffed.

""Stop saying nonsense.""

I looked at my phone again, my heart pounding. Maybe Daniel was right. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, it vibrated again in my hand. Unknown number.

I ignored the call. I didn’t even say anything to the others. I just blocked the screen, put my phone in my bag, and pretended nothing had happened. That everything was fine.

I couldn’t oppose it. Deep down, I needed to see it with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I agreed. ""Let’s go.""

No one complained. They all understood that, after what had happened, I couldn’t go alone.",1,1741893719.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1jak9zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jak9zw/minute_64/,Minute 64,"I always thought urban legends were just that: stories to scare us and make us lose sleep for no reason. As a biology student, I got used to looking for rational explanations for everything, even when something made me uneasy. But what happened to my friends and me that semester is still the only thing I haven’t been able to explain.

It all started one Friday afternoon, after a field practice. We had gathered in the faculty cafeteria to rest before heading home. Miguel, as usual, brought up a strange topic.

“Have you ever heard of the 'Night Call Syndrome'?” he asked, absentmindedly stirring his coffee.

Laura snorted, skeptical. “Let me guess. A creepypasta?”

“Kind of,” Miguel said with a smile. “They say some people get a call at 3:33 AM. The number doesn’t show up on the screen, just 'Unknown.' If you answer, at first you just hear noise, like someone breathing on the other side. But if you stay on the line long enough... you hear your own voice.”

A chill ran down my spine. Alejandra, who had been distracted with her phone until that moment, looked up.

“And what’s that voice supposed to say?” she asked.

Miguel put his cup down and leaned toward us.

“They say it tells you the exact time you’re going to die.”

Daniel burst out laughing. “How convenient. A death call that only happens at 3:33. Why not at 4:44 or something more dramatic?”

We laughed because that made sense. It was an absurd story, something told to make us uneasy, but nothing more.

“Come on, genetics class is about to start, and I don’t want Camilo to give us that hawk stare for walking in late,” I said, annoyed.

“Hurry up, I can’t miss genetics! I refuse to see that class with that guy again,” Miguel said, half worried, half annoyed.

We really hated the genetics class. It wasn’t the subject itself; it was... Camilo. He was the professor in charge, and he didn’t make things easy or comfortable for us. We grabbed our things and headed to class, hoping to understand at least something of what that teacher said.

In the following days, the conversation about the night call was forgotten. We had exams coming up, lab practices, and an ecology report that was driving us crazy. But then, five nights after that conversation, something happened.

It was almost four in the morning when my phone vibrated on the nightstand. I woke up startled and, still groggy, squinted at the screen. It was a message from Alejandra.

""Are you awake?""

I frowned. It wasn’t unusual for Alejandra to stay up late, but she never texted me at this hour. I replied with a simple ""What’s up?"" Almost immediately, the three dots appeared, indicating she was typing.

“They called me.”

I felt a void in my stomach. “Who?” I typed with trembling fingers.

“I don’t know. No number showed up. It just said 'Unknown.'”

I stared at the screen, waiting for more, but Alejandra stopped typing. The silence of the night became heavy, like the room had shrunk around me.

“Did you answer?” I finally wrote.

A few eternal seconds passed before her response came.

“Yes.”

The air caught in my throat.

“And what did you hear?”

The three dots appeared again, but this time they took longer. When her response finally arrived, it gave me chills.

“My voice. It said my name. And then... it told me an exact time.”

My heart started pounding. I sat up abruptly, turned on the light, and dialed her number. It rang three times before she answered.

“Ale, tell me this is a joke,” I whispered.

There was a brief silence before she spoke. She sounded scared.

“I’m not joking. They told me a date and time: Thursday at 3:33 AM. And it was my voice, my own voice!”

My skin crawled. Thursday was only two days away. I stayed silent, the phone pressed to my ear. I wanted to say something, anything that would calm Alejandra, but I couldn’t find the words. Her breathing was shallow, as if she was on the verge of a panic attack.

“Ale, this has to be a joke,” I finally said, trying to sound firm.

“That’s what I thought…” Her voice trembled. “I want to think someone’s messing with me, but... I felt something. It wasn’t just a call, it wasn’t static noise. It was my voice. And it sounded so sure when it said the time…”

I ran a hand over my face, trying to shake off the numbness of the early morning.

“It has to be Miguel,” I blurted. “He was the one who told us that story, he’s probably messing with us.”

Alejandra took a moment to respond.

“Yeah… I guess so,” she said, but she didn’t sound convinced.

“Think about it,” I insisted. “In all those stories, there’s a trigger, something people do to activate the curse or whatever. In creepypastas, there’s always a ritual, a cursed website, a mirror at midnight, touching a forbidden object, selling your soul to the devil, something! But we didn’t do anything.”

A silence settled over the line.

“Right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.

Alejandra didn’t respond immediately.

I shuddered. For a moment, I imagined both of us mentally reviewing the past few days, trying to find a moment where we’d done something out of the ordinary, something that could have triggered this. But there was nothing. At least, nothing we remembered.

“We need to talk to Miguel,” I said finally. “If this is a joke, he’ll confess.”

“Yeah…” Alejandra whispered.

“Try to sleep, okay? We’ll clear this up tomorrow... well, later, when we meet at university.”

“I don’t think I can.”

I didn’t know how to respond. We stayed on the line a few more seconds before finally hanging up. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling. I tried to convince myself it was all nonsense, but the skin on my arms was still crawling. I couldn’t stop thinking about the time.

Thursday, 3:33 AM.

It was stupid, but I couldn’t help but check my phone screen. 3:57 AM. I swallowed and turned off the light. That night, I couldn’t sleep, drifting into what seemed like deep sleep, only to wake up suddenly. I checked my phone again. 4:38 AM. I’d be wasting my time if I tried to sleep. I had to leave now if I wanted to make it to the 7:00 AM class. I’d have to try to sleep a little on the bus.

That morning, we showed up with the faces of the sleepless. Alejandra looked pale, with furrowed brows, but didn’t say anything when she saw me. We just walked together to the faculty, in silence. We found Miguel in the courtyard, laughing with Daniel and Laura. Like nothing had happened. Like he hadn’t just played a sick prank on us. I crossed my arms and stood in front of him.

“Very funny, Miguel,” I said, without even greeting him.

He looked up, confused.

“Huh? Good morning, how are you? I’m good, thanks for asking,” he said in an ironic and playful tone.

Alejandra didn’t say anything, she just stayed a few steps behind me, lips tight.

“The call,” I said. “You can stop the show now.”

Miguel blinked.

“What call?”

I frowned.

“Come on, don’t play dumb. The 3:33 call. The creepypasta you told us. Alejandra got it last night.”

Laura and Daniel exchanged glances. Miguel, on the other hand, stood still.

“What?”

His tone didn’t sound like fake surprise. I didn’t like that.

“If this is a joke, you can stop now... because it’s not funny,” I warned.

“I’m not joking,” he said, quietly. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My stomach twisted. Alejandra tensed beside me.

“What do you mean ‘no idea’? You told us the story,” Alejandra whispered.

“Yeah, but…” Miguel scratched his neck, uneasy. “I just heard it from a cousin. I never said it was real.”

An uncomfortable silence settled between us.

“Okay, calm down,” Daniel said, raising his hands. “If Miguel didn’t do it, then someone’s messing with you. Couldn’t it just be some random guy with too much free time?”

“How can it be random if the voice I heard was mine?” Alejandra snapped.

We all fell silent. Miguel rubbed his hands together nervously.

“Look... if this is real,” he said quietly, “the story I heard said something else.”

Alejandra and I looked at him, tense.

“If you get the call and answer... there’s no way to avoid it.”

The air seemed to thicken.

“That’s stupid,” I said, trying to laugh, but my voice sounded hollow.

“That’s what the story said,” Miguel insisted, looking at us seriously. “And there’s more.”

We waited.

“If Alejandra answered… she won’t be the only one to get the call.”

A chill ran down my spine. I slowly turned to Alejandra, but she was already looking at me, wide-eyed. Daniel broke the silence with a nervous laugh.

“Well, then it’s easy. No one answers calls from 'Unknown,' and that’s it.”

“And if you don’t have a choice?” Alejandra asked, in a whisper.

I didn’t understand what she meant until my phone vibrated in my pocket. I felt a cold jolt in my chest. I pulled the phone out with trembling fingers. On the screen, there was no number. Just one word.

Unknown.

The phone kept vibrating in my hand. Fear gripped my chest, freezing my fingers.

“Don’t answer,” Alejandra whispered, wide-eyed.

Laura and Daniel looked at us, frowning, waiting for me to do something. Miguel, however, looked too serious, as if he already knew what was going to happen. I swallowed. It was just a call. Nothing more. If I didn’t answer, I’d just be feeding the irrational fear that Miguel had planted with his stupid story. I had to show Alejandra nothing was going to happen. But my hands trembled. The buzzing of the phone seemed to reverberate in my bones.

“Don’t do it…” Alejandra insisted, grabbing my arm.

I swallowed. And I answered.

“H-Hello?”

Nothing. White noise. A soft, intermittent sound, like someone breathing on the other side of the line. A chill ran down my spine.

I looked at my friends, wide-eyed. Miguel watched me, tense, as if waiting for the worst. Laura and Daniel stared at me, holding their breath. Alejandra shook her head, terrified. I wanted to hang up too. I needed to. I moved my finger toward the screen. And then, a familiar voice broke the silence.

“Hello? Sweetheart?”

I felt deflated. It was my mom. I put a hand to my chest, releasing the air I hadn’t realized I’d been holding.

“Mom...” my voice came out shaky. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing, honey. You left your phone on the table, and I noticed when I got to the office. I’m calling you from here. Everything okay?”

I couldn't believe it. I turned to Alejandra and the others with a trembling smile. I sighed, feeling ridiculous for being so scared.

""Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.""

""Well, see you at home. Don't forget to buy what I asked for.""

""Yeah... okay.""

I hung up and let my arm drop, suddenly feeling exhausted. I turned to my friends.

""It was my mom.""

Alejandra's shoulders slumped. Daniel and Laura exchanged glances and laughed in relief.

""I knew it,"" Daniel said, shaking his head. ""We're overthinking this.""

Alejandra still looked tense, but she let out a sigh.

""God... I swear, I thought that...""

""That what?"" I interrupted, smiling. ""That a curse fell on us just because Miguel told us an internet story?""

Alejandra didn’t answer. Miguel, however, was still staring at me, frowning.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

He took a while to respond.

""Did your mom call you from her office?""

""Yeah... why?""

Miguel squinted.

""Then why did it say 'Unknown' on the screen?""

The relief evaporated in my chest. I froze.

""What...?""

I looked at the phone screen. The call wasn’t in the history. The fear hit me again, hard. Alejandra put a hand over her mouth. Daniel and Laura stopped smiling. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Because the last thing my mom said before hanging up... was that I had forgotten my phone at home.

But it was in my hand.

The silence grew thick. No one spoke.

I looked at my phone screen, my fingers stiff around it. It wasn’t in the call history. There was no record of me answering. And my mom’s voice… I swallowed.

""I... I heard her. I'm sure she said I left the phone at home.""

Alejandra shifted uncomfortably beside me, crossing her arms over her chest.

""But... you have it in your hand.""

My stomach churned.

""Maybe you just misunderstood,"" Daniel interjected, with his logical tone, as if he were explaining a simple math problem. ""You said you were nervous, and you were. Your mom probably said she left the phone on the table. That she left it at home, not your phone.""

I stared at him.

""You think I imagined it?""

""I’m not saying you imagined it, just that you interpreted it wrong. It's normal."" Daniel waved his hand. ""The brain tends to fill in information when it’s in an anxious state. Sometimes we hear what we’re afraid to hear.""

Alejandra nodded slowly, as if trying to convince herself he was right. Laura, on the other hand, still had her lips pursed.

""But the call history..."" she murmured.

""That is strange,"" Daniel admitted, ""but there are logical explanations. It could’ve been a glitch, or the number was hidden. There are apps that allow that.""

""And the white noise?"" Alejandra interrupted.

Daniel shrugged.

""Bad signal. My point is, if your mom called, that's the important part. All the rest are details that were exaggerated because we were scared.""

I crossed my arms. I wanted to believe him. I wanted him to be right. But something in my stomach wouldn’t let go. Miguel, who had been quiet up until now, rubbed his chin.

""Maybe it’s just that... or maybe it’s already started.""

Alejandra shot him a sharp look.

""Miguel!""

He shrugged with a half-smile, but didn’t seem as relaxed as he tried to appear.

""I’m just saying.""

Daniel scoffed.

""Stop saying nonsense.""

I looked at my phone again, my heart pounding. Maybe Daniel was right. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, it vibrated again in my hand. Unknown number.

I ignored the call. I didn’t even say anything to the others. I just blocked the screen, put my phone in my bag, and pretended nothing had happened. That everything was fine. I had a physiology exam to do. I couldn’t lose my mind now. But as soon as I sat in the classroom and saw the paper in front of me, I knew I couldn’t concentrate. The questions were there, waiting for answers I would’ve known by heart at another time. ""Why does a boa’s heart rate and ventilation decrease after hunting? What are the implications for its metabolism?""

I had no idea. Because my mind wasn’t here. I could only think about the call. About the word “Unknown” glowing on my screen. About the possibility that, at this very moment, my phone was vibrating inside my bag.

I tried to focus. I took a breath. I answered a few things with whatever my brain could piece together. But when time was up and they collected the papers, I knew my result would be disastrous.

We left in silence. Alejandra walked beside me with a frown, but didn’t say anything. Maybe she hadn’t done well either. When we reached the cafeteria, hunger hit all of us at the same time. A black hole in our stomachs. We had an hour before the lab, and if we didn’t eat now, we wouldn’t eat later.

We ordered food, sat at our usual table, and for a moment, the world felt normal again. Until I took out my phone. And saw the five missed calls. All from the same unknown number.

I didn’t eat.

While the others devoured their meals, I was completely absorbed in the screen of my phone. I needed to find the story.

I searched by keywords: mysterious call, unknown number, phone creepypasta, cursed night call, call at 3:33 a.m. Click after click, I entered forums, horror story websites, blogs with strange fonts and dark backgrounds. I read story after story, but none matched exactly what Miguel had told us that day. Something told me that if I understood the story well, if I found its origin, we could do something to get away from it. To prevent it from becoming our reality.

Everything around me became a distant murmur, background noise without importance. Until a hand appeared out of nowhere and snatched the phone from me. I blinked, surprised. Daniel was looking at me with a mix of pity and understanding.

""Seriously?"" he said, holding the phone as if he had just caught me in the middle of a madness.

I didn’t respond. Daniel sighed, swiped his finger across the screen, and saw the page I was on. His eyes hardened for a moment before turning to Miguel.

""You need to tell us exactly where you found that story.""

""I already told you, my cousin told me,"" Miguel replied.

""Then message him and ask where he got it from,"" Daniel insisted. ""We need to read the full version. She’s going to go crazy if she doesn’t know the whole thing... Look at her! She hasn’t eaten a bite and it’s her favorite food!""

Miguel frowned, but took out his phone and started typing. I took advantage of the pause to let out what had been gnawing at me inside.

""I received more calls,"" I said quietly.

Alejandra lifted her head sharply. Laura dropped her spoon.

""What?"" Alejandra asked.

""During the exam,"" I murmured. ""Several times.""

Daniel squinted.

""Probably it was your mom again, from her office.""

I shook my head.

""No. She knew I had the exam at that time. She wouldn’t call me then.""

Daniel didn’t seem convinced.

""Maybe there was an emergency.""

His logic was overwhelming, but something in my stomach told me no. Still, if I wanted peace of mind, there was a way to confirm it. I took my phone from his hand and searched the contact list.

""What are you doing?"" Laura asked.

""I'm going to call my mom. But to her cell, not the unknown number.""

If my mom really had forgotten her phone at home, then she wouldn’t answer. And that would mean that the calls from the unknown number had been made by her from her office. And that all of this had nothing to do with Miguel’s creepypasta. I swallowed and pressed call. The ringtone rang once. Then again. And then someone answered.

""Mom?"" I asked immediately.

Silence.

I frowned. The line didn’t sound normal. It wasn’t white noise, nor interference. It was... like someone was breathing very, very softly.

""Who are you?"" I asked, my voice coming out more tense than I intended.

Nothing.

""Why do you have my mom’s phone?"" I insisted.

More breathing. Something creaked in the background.

""Answer me!""

Then the voice changed. It was no longer the static whisper of a stranger. It was my voice... or something that sounded exactly like my voice.

""Tuesday 1:04 p.m.""

It wasn’t said with aggression or drama. It was just spoken, as if it were an absolute truth. A chill ran down my spine.

""What... what does that mean?""

But there was no answer. Just the dry sound of the call ending. I was left with the phone stuck to my ear, paralyzed.

""What happened?"" Laura asked urgently.

I didn’t respond. With trembling fingers, I called my mom’s number again. This time, the operator answered coldly:

""The number you have dialed is turned off or out of coverage.""

No.

No. No. No.

My friends stared at me in complete silence. I could barely breathe. I decided to do the only thing I could: call the unknown number that had been calling me during the exam. It rang twice.

""Hello?"" a woman’s voice answered.

It wasn’t my mom. It was an unknown woman, who let out a small laugh before speaking.

""Oh, sorry. Your mom is on her lunch break, that’s why she’s not in the office. But if you want, I can leave her a message. Or I can tell her to call you when she gets back.""

The knot in my stomach tightened.

""No... it’s not necessary. Just tell her we’ll see her at home.""

""Okay, I’ll let her know.""

I hung up.

My hands were trembling. I could feel the weight of all their stares on me.

""Who was that?"" Miguel asked.

""Someone from my mom’s office.""

""And what did she say?""

I swallowed.

""That my mom is on her lunch break.""

Nobody said anything. But I could see on their faces that they were all thinking the same thing. If my mom was at her office, having lunch, without her cell... then who had it?

""I don’t understand what’s happening,"" Alejandra whispered.

Neither did I.

I told them everything. That someone had answered my mom’s phone. That she hadn’t said anything until I demanded answers. That then... she spoke with my voice. That she gave me an exact date and time. That later I called my mom and her phone was off.

""This doesn’t make sense,"" Miguel said.

""It can’t be a coincidence,"" Laura whispered.

No one had answers. Not even Daniel. He, who always found the logical way out, was silent. Finally, it was him who spoke.

""The most logical explanation is that someone entered your house.""

His voice sounded tense, forced.

""Maybe a thief. Or a thief... since you said the voice was female. That would explain why someone answered your mom’s phone.""

""And my voice? Because that wasn’t just a female voice, it was my own voice, Daniel!"" I asked in a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer.

""And the day and time?"" I continued, feeling panic rise in my throat. ""Is it the exact moment when I’m going to die?""

Silence. Daniel couldn’t give me an answer. And that terrified me more than anything else.

Laura looked at all of us, still with the tension hanging in the air. It was clear she was trying to stay calm, even though her eyes reflected the same uncertainty we all felt.

""Listen,"" she finally said, ""we can’t keep speculating here and letting ourselves be carried away by panic. We need proof, something concrete.""

""And how are we supposed to do that?"" Miguel asked, crossing his arms.

""We’ll go to your house,"" Laura said, turning to me. ""If it really was a thief, we’ll know immediately. If the door is forced, if things are messed up, if something’s missing... that would confirm that someone entered and that the call you received was simply from someone who found your mom’s phone and answered it.""

""And if we don’t find anything..."" murmured Alejandra, without finishing the sentence.

Laura sighed.

""If we don’t find anything, we’ll think of another explanation. But at least we’ll rule one possibility out.""

I couldn’t oppose it. Deep down, I needed to see it with my own eyes.

""Okay,"" I agreed. ""Let’s go.""

No one complained. They all understood that, after what had happened, I couldn’t go alone.",1,1741893684.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1jak8iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofGod/comments/1jak8iy/i_have_a_crack_theory_about_our_favourite_coffee/,I have a crack theory about our favourite coffee addict (TLDR at the bottom),"In S3 Ch 108, as Perseus is about to choke Hansung, he says something very peculiar about the family heads' contract of immortality and about some man telling him to do something. Hearing this, Traum-Traum tells Perseus to stop choking Hansung and that Hansung is the guy his 'friend' is looking for. One of SIU's blog posts, which stated that Hendo Lok Bloodmadder and Hansung Yu are deeply connected, and the fact that Traumerei called him his 'friend' has made most if the community agree that the guy Traumerei is talking about is Bloodmadder himself. 

Now we all know that for some reason, the immortality contract that Bloodmadder recieved is different from the ones that all the family leaders got, in that he can increase his lifespan by reducing the lifespan of his kids(fucked up, ik). So from all of these clues, its reasonable to assume that Bloodmadder's (if the person looking for him is bloodmadder) reasons for wanting Hansung have to do with the True Immortality Contract, which will allow him to attain the benefits of the contract without any horrible and costly tradeoffs. 

Now, we need to talk about Hansung's connections with another great warrior: V. 

V's existence is something forgotten- only remembered by a few- including the family heads, Luslec and some of the higher ups at FUG, etc. The fact that he and Arlen even existed is something that the Family Heads and Jahad went to great trouble to hide. And yet, Hansung Y, who isn't even that highly ranked in FUG, somehow knows of his existence? Also, Hansung can somehow use one of V's Shinsu Control skills(The water dragon, though it doesn't look the same, they both share the name). 

Another thing that's interesting here is that unlike the 10 Family heads, V just straight up refused an immortality contract for reasons unknown. Which means that the admin probably made a contract for V, but V just refused to sign it. Now here's where the crack starts to hit: What if the contract that was rejected by V wasn't discarded, but somehow gained a body and soul and turned into a person? And what if this person is Hansung Yu? Perhaps the contracts are tied more deeply than previously thought to each family head, which is how Hansung knows one of V's moves. 

Assuming that the contract offered to V was a True Immortality Contract, this could explain why Bloodmadder is looking so hard for the dude. Maybe Bloodmadder wants to change the contract so that it is bonded to him instead of V(though I don't really see how that's possible) and end the cursed nature of his life. 

Tldr: I think that the immortality contract that was discarded by V turned into Hansung Yu, and Bloodmadder wants Hansung in order to make the contract his and achieve true immortality. This theory does depend a lot on blog posts, which I'm aware can't really be considered canon anymore, but I think they can still be used for fun speculatio.

I thought it was just another gimmick at first, but then I found this \*hidden trick\* that’s got me obsessed. You ready for this? 

If you slip some parentheses into your prompts, like ""(winking playfully)"" or ""(soft laugh),"" the AI locks onto those vibes and cranks the responses up to eleven. I’m talking detailed, flirty, or downright hilarious replies that feel way more alive than the usual chatbot chatter.

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far—maybe you’ve got tricks to add?

* **Prompt Power:** Adding those little ""(action)"" bits—like ""(sipping coffee)"" or ""(teasing grin)""—makes the AI paint a scene instead of just replying. I tried it, and my companion went from “Hey, how’s it going?” to “Hey, how’s it going? \*leans in with a smirk\*.” Night and day difference.
* **Tone Tweaks:** Pair it with a mood, like “Tell me a story (whispering mysteriously),” and it’s like the AI’s suddenly auditioning for a drama. Got a spooky tale that legit gave me chills.
* **Personality Boost:** I tossed in “(cheeky wink)” during a flirty chat, and the AI threw back sass I didn’t even know it had. It’s like unlocking a secret personality mode.

In the process of installing a Zone 2"" suspension lift on a 95 YJ and need to purchase new shocks to replace the OEM. After a bunch of research it seems like the general consensus is to go rancho or bilstein, and given that my Jeep is mostly a coffee crawler (with light weekend access trail work in fair weather), I was looking at Rancho RS5000X series for a potentially softer ride on pavement. However, I'm a bit perplexed now because Rancho does not appear to manufacture a rear shock that fits? The RS 55168 appears to be suitable for stock to 1.5"" lift, whereas the RS 55118 specifies 2.5""+. 

The vendor I bought the zone kit from recommended sticking with the stock option as ""Rancho shocks run long"" but a few other forums have suggested it's better to go longer. What say ye? Or should I be looking at some other options entirely, that explicitly manufacture shocks at the 2"" height level. I could always go back to the zone (or bds) option, and I've seen that skyjacker has a nitro product that would probably work as well.

1jak4qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1jak4qj/why_i_quit/,Why I Quit,"This subreddit kept me going through my job as a barista, and later as a barista trainer.  I should preface everything by saying I'm no stranger to food and customer service jobs.  I've done everything from bussing to dishwashing to catering to serving to baking at the ass crack of dawn, and for what it was worth, sbux was no different.  I was even named Partner of the Quarter, if that's worth anything.

But the biggest thing I discovered after ten months of employment was the sheer sense of entitlement that this company has fostered.

We had amazing customers come through, and even more fantastic regulars on top of that.  But every single day we'd have to put up with a new form of bull, and no amount of positive interactions ever made it easier.  It was getting to the point where myself or my coworkers (I'm sorry, I could never get behind the 'partner' thing.  I'm not a 'partner' to you (ie. the company) if I am not cared for) would have to go to our back room for a crying break.  We would take out our anger on the boxes in the recycling bucket.

Sbux's company culture has valued the customer to the point where being behind the counter made me feel subhuman.  I felt like I was a mindless robot, trained to constantly take the blame for every wrongdoing, no matter what.  The LATTE model?  Listen, Apologize, Take Action, and what else?  In less than a year of employment I've been screamed at, cursed at, had things thrown at me, been threatened, been harassed.  My coworkers have been stalked by customers, had threats of violence against them.  All over some espresso.  The attitudes of some Sbux customers are beyond what a normal customer service job would expect, and I truly believe that all of it is because of the customer-focused morale of the company down to its very core.  In every job I've had, I never once saw any of my coworkers be called a slur until I was behind the counter of my former Sbux.  And that happened far too many times to count.  The irony behind that has not escaped me, but it truly is no laughing matter.

""But Savings\_Barracuda\_90--"" I hear you potentially asking.  I truly wish I was making this up.  From the very bottom of my soul, I wish this wasn't the reality.  But unfortunately, for me, it was.

De-escalation training did not teach me to value my personal safety or the wellbeing of my beloved coworkers and friends.  It took ""the customer is always right"" to an entirely new level, where we were no longer individuals, we were mindless coffee-making robots forced to interact with every single customer while also keeping drive-thru times down while also keeping spaces clean while also maintaining the cafe while also while also while also.

I'm an adult, I've been around, and while I still have a while left to live (hopefully) I truly feel like I've seen it all at Sbux.  And this is barely even me scratching the surface, this is simply me airing out my frustrations in a place on the internet where I found myself coming to for comfort after a particularly rough shift.

To everyone in this subreddit, to all the baristas, shifts, managers, or former, my heart truly goes out to you.  You're doing amazing.  Working in today's day isn't easy in the slightest, but you're here doing your best to get by in this crazy world and I commend you.  If you love Sbux, as a customer or an employee, you are 100% entitled to your opinion.  Absolutely no part of this rant is directed at anyone in particular, which I hope goes without saying.

I still drink Sbux... I am guilty of being an espresso lover.

But since quitting, I have been tipping the baristas making my drink $3 instead of $1.",6,1741893316.0,starbucksbaristas,1,0.87,False

I signed an NDA and an Arbitration Agreement as part of my onboarding (an unpaid 8 hour training- my first red flag). I am a bit unsure about what my options are. But an issue I've experienced, and others have claimed to as well, is that they expect us to clock out 15 minutes after the store's closing time. 

  
This was not mentioned to me during my training, but rather offhand by another employee some days later. When I did the cleaning training, it took us, a team of the manager and three trainees, a little over an hour to close. This manager has seen me leaving the store about 2 hours after closing and was just ""oh hi!"" about it, not ""what are you still doing here?"" because the store I typically work at is enormous, and they only ever staff one barista per shift. I always clock out when I'm finished, usually about 90 minutes after closing, between cleaning the coffee machine, mopping, cleaning surfaces, restocking, taking out the 10 trashes, counting cash, etc. 

We employees are unable to see our timeclocks, but it has become apparent to me (and has been backed up by the claims of others) that we are not paid for this time spent cleaning and that our punches are blatantly disregarded. We also send photos of us closing the store into a work group chat, which are timestamped.

  
I have already contacted the labor bureau of the USA and PR and was told that this is illegal and constitutes wage theft. What I want to know is whether I am actually able to pursue these stolen wages and/or file some kind of complaint about the company and its labor practices given the NDA I signed. I thought it was a red flag at the time that I was signing for such a low-level position but assumed it was because of their coffee and because they're still a small-er business. I am afraid of getting myself in trouble, but I don't just want to let this go. An NDA shouldn't allow them to flagrantly violate labor laws with total impunity, RIGHT???!! They way they run their business is unconscionable, and I want to know what my rights are. Thank you <3",1,1741893176.0,legaladvice,2,1.0,False

What I've done thus far:

1. Tried ChatGPT Tasks Beta - This seems beyond its scope and seems more for ""Send me my horiscope daily at 7am"" type stuff. While it will likely improve and I'm excited about it, I'm guessing this is out of scope for it right now.

2. Looked at some of the Zapier zaps - surely this has been done before?

3. Looked at IFTT - same. While I found an AI summarizer, the multi-step process here of researching/monitoring, then summarizing, then formatting, then compiling felt too complex for it.

4. Started looking at the ChatGPT API for it, but I'm not a developer so a simpler solution would be best, unless it's easier than I'm making it out to be(?)

5. Looked at Feedly Pro plan, and while it is super cool for monitoring, the compilation stuff is only avaialble to Enterprise plan customers and that's just not me.

6. I've found that I can use a God Prompt to create what I need to be able to run this manually, but A) I'm trying to automate it and B) I think I'm running into token caps when I instruct it to include at least ten summary snippets in the compilation and if it finds there aren't enough new content pieces, to state so. Don't halucinate, blah blah.

Desired Output:

I'd like to create something customizable and updateable that I receive by email daily at a fixed time Mon-Sun, something akin to what one might publish as a newsletter or read the single email over coffee in the AM to stay current on \[topics, key phrases\] from \[sources monitored\].

Bonus points if I can be sent an SMS text message when it's been completed and emailed to me so I can go read it.

1jak0lb,https://i.redd.it/6vmdhwdaaioe1.jpeg,"USS Kuuki, NCC-91857-BG – The Defiant-Class Spin-Off Nobody Asked For, But Everybody Needs","

Ayo, let me introduce y’all to the most unauthorized, heavily modded, Defiant-class spin-off to ever hit the streets—the USS Kuuki, NCC-91857-BG. It ain't Federation-approved, but that's what makes it a real beast.

Specs & Unauthorized Tech:

Warp 9+ Equivalent Drive – Lucid’s high-voltage battery system pushing boundaries like a rogue Starfleet engineer with no oversight.

Silent Running Mode – Straight-up cloaking tech. Stealthier than a Section 31 black-ops ship when gliding through the city at night.

Quantum Torque Thrusters – The instant acceleration on this thing would make a Jem’Hadar fighter jealous.

Adaptive AI Co-Pilot (aka Ninja, Chaos Officer) – Sometimes useful, mostly an agent of chaos. Likes to adjust settings mid-drive just to keep me on my toes.

Regenerative Shields (Lucid DreamDrive Pro) – Advanced collision avoidance. Starfleet might call it a safety feature, I call it autonomous evasive maneuvers.

Custom LCARS HUD (Meta Ray-Bans Integration) – Augmented reality display straight outta a sci-fi movie. Gives me ship diagnostics, nav updates, and the occasional reminder that I left my coffee on the roof.


Crew Roster:

Captain: Duna – Gen X strategist, rogue Federation veteran, runs on coffee and skepticism.

Chaos Officer: Ninja – Unpredictable, constantly testing the limits of AI autonomy, probably working for Q.


Mission Status:
Patrolling the solar highways, pushing the limits of modern tech, and proving that Starfleet regulations were made to be ""creatively interpreted.""

Any other rogue captains out there modding their ships beyond the limits of what’s ""legal"" or ""reasonable""? Let’s talk unauthorized tech upgrades. 🚀

The tooth to the right of my right canine was still a baby tooth, and the adult one was growing out of the roof of my mouth.

I had a surgery to have a little barbell chain thing attached to that tooth, which slowly pulled it down. Kind of cool actually.

Well after the tooth came into place, they put a bar in the top of my mouth. The bar cut into my tongue and left a scar. It was extremely painful and I wore it for months before they finally removed it.

1jajxro,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgoseason/comments/1jajxro/what_does_it_mean/,What does it mean,"Hello lovely Virgos, I have a question for y'all (particularly the men in here)!

First of all let me give some quick context: I dated this man last summer, he has a 4 planet stellium in Virgo (Sun, Moon, Venus and Mercury) + Leo Rising (yes, he is extremely intense but so am I lol). We dated for around a month and a half and then he broke up with me around the date of the lunar eclipse in Pisces last September, right before his birthday. We haven't spoken since, and it took a lot of crying alone in my bedroom, but I managed to move on. 

Then at the beginning of Venus retrograde, he suddenly popped into my thoughts again and I literally could NOT stop thinking about him, so I caved and texted him. We had a pretty good convo; he seemed receptive to speaking with me and responded to everything pretty fast and seemed excited to show off his progress with life. Idk what got into me (Mercury in Aries ... ), but I asked him to get coffee on the 8th. He had a trip planned that weekend, so we decided to meet up this week instead. Yes, on the day of/day after the eclipse lol. I had been trying to avoid that but apparently fate had other plans

Anyway, when we were together he was kind of funemployed and didn't really have his shit together. Since then, it seems like he's put in literally SO much effort to get back on his feet - his career is back on track, he's going to the gym regularly (and looks damn good ngl), and just generally seems super motivated and focused. I'm really happy for him. I've been working on myself too, and realized that, in hindsight, I wasn't really the best partner and I was kinda needy (blame my Cancer Sun lol). Also I was a bit possessive of him which I could tell he Did Not Like, although he went out without me pretty regularly and I never had an issue with that. Since then, I've reflected a lot on what I actually want from life and a relationship (prior to this one I was single for 5 years, him for 3), and I feel like I've grown a lot as well.

Anyway, I've heard that once a Virgo makes up their mind they will never go back on their decision, because of how much thought and anxiety they've put into making that choice in the first place. I know he was at least sad to leave me - the last time we saw each other to give our stuff back, I saw him wiping tears away as he walked off even though he is usually very unemotional, especially in public (I don't think he knows that I saw this). 

Have any of y'all ever gotten back together with an ex when you were the one who dumped them? Or do you just feel icked out at the thought (I feel this way abt some of my exes). I am nervous to see him and I just wonder, but if he just wants to be friends I've also made my peace with that and will not cry until I get home lol.

Thank you anyone who answers, I literally love you people and your calm rationality lol. My Cancer ass needs your groundedness in my life

Edit for clarity: The last time we saw each other, he told me to text him when I felt better. Also I am genuinely going into meeting him with no expectations. Gonna just feel out the vibes and not put any pressure on for any particular outcome, I really miss being friends with him and I am genuinely okay with whatever happens.",1,1741892836.0,virgoseason,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! I had a previous manager reached out to me about an internal opening she’s hiring for. We’re both still at the same company, and have a great professional relationship. We always worked really well together.

The application doesn’t require a cover letter, but it’s a two level jump in title, and I’m under-qualified on paper (I probably wouldn’t go for it if she hadn’t asked me to apply), so I think it’s best to take every opportunity I have to make my case. I know most hiring managers don’t read them, but I think this particular manager would like to see the initiative and responsibility even if she never opens the document.

Anyway, I have a coffee chat with her next week to learn more about the role but I want to be able to send her a copy of my resume and cover letter afterwards. How do you write a cover letter to someone who you know? How formal should it be? And should I address the fact I used to work for her?

1jajvb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501Canada/comments/1jajvb7/what_war_would_actually_look_like/,What war would actually look like,"Canadian here.

I was speaking with a couple Americans at a bar last night, and they were laughing about the annexation threats, saying that if we didn't want that, they could just invade.

I asked them if they understood the consequences of war with Canada, and they said ""it'd be fine.""

I left at that point, and it's been bothering me since.

I wanted to take a moment to explain just exactly what full-scale war with Canada would look like, in case any supporters of such a thing don't actually understand what it would mean.

Before you continue.. reading about war described accurately is pretty upsetting.  If you don't need to hear this and already think war would catastrophic, you might just want to skip this post.

**War with Canada**

We are 40,000,000 people and we share an 8,891km border with you (5,525 miles).

We look like you, and we sound like you.  We understand your history, your institutions, your states and geography, your fears, your jokes, and your culture better than many Americans do.  We can blend in and become indistinguishable.  Many of us have lived among you, and many of our closest friends and family are American.

In the event of full-scale war

Our world record for the longest sniping confirmed kill was only recently beaten by a Ukrainian.  We have access to modern weapons and ammunition with a sufficient stockpile and no effective means of blockade, night vision equipment, encrypted communications, explosives, drones, satellites in orbit, and are a NATO member.

Our military would not attempt to directly intervene initially.  Instead, they, and civilians would be crossing the border at a time and place of their choosing to join the millions of Canadians already in the US, and causing as much death, destruction, and terror as possible before blending back into the population.

Canada has a history of viciousness in war so appreciated many of the Geneva Convention rules of war were created to criminalize our actions during the world wars.  Rest assured, few Canadians would observe that document while defending our right to exist.

I'd like you to close your eyes and imagine seeing the schoolbus carrying your child a burning wreck after being destroyed by a roadside bomb.  Imagine trying to explain to your 3-year-old why their brother isn't coming home, and why they need to stay away from the windows and can't play outside.  There was peace and safety only one year before.

Meanwhile, in Canadian cities, American soldiers who obeyed orders or were drafted would be trapped in a slow grind that would make Iraq look like the good old days.  If you have service members in your family, imagine them on their fourth tour trying desperately to complete an impossible task, wondering if today was the day they'd be shot in the liver and die an excruciating death for no appreciable gain.

This is what war is.  This is what war with Canada looks like.

If you have a functioning amygdala, this should all send chills down your spine.  This is a level of horror that is almost impossible to comprehend unless you've seen it yourself.

But none of the above is actually the worst part.

More terrifying than the response of Canadian forces and civilians would be the response of American patriots who are already running out of patience with what appears to be a Russian asset trying to shatter the country.

In the event of a full-scale war, there's every reason to believe an immediate and total US civil war would begin, possibly introducing tens of millions of new heavily armed and enraged Americans fighting to restore the rule of law, regain independence from Russia, and end the war with Canada.  There would almost certainly be direct coordination with Canadian forces, including intelligence sharing, weapon exchange, and joint operations, and may of these folks will be high-ranking military personelle with top-secret intelligence on targets of opportunity.

Even away from the most intense fighting, this would mean a complete economic collapse.  Gas, if available, would be prohibitively expensive.  Domestic food production would be far less effective, and a large part of the rest of the world would refuse to provide food aid.  China, benefiting from a further collapse of America, would likely provide arms to Canada while introducing trade embargoes on the US, meaning everyday items like technology, staples, and construction equipment would be far more expensive or impossible to obtain.  Many could starve, and few would have access to luxuries like coffee or fruit.

Energy infrastructure would be a prime target for Canadian forces, and Canada would cease to provide the large amount of electricity we currently do, leading to rolling or total blackouts in many areas.  Hospitals need power, or patients start to die.  Businesses close, food production slows, and cell phones stop working.

Consider what it would feel like a year or two into it.  All of this pain and suffering to invade an ally who wants nothing but a prosperous, peaceful relationship with friendly neighbors to the South.  All of this suffering just so that Russia will face less opposition while they attack our European allies.

If you feel it would help, there's a very well researched and presented podcast that explores what life would be like during a US civil war [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6DZnXs2ob5HmxpDZtbk4fd).  Civil war during a war with Canada would be significantly worse, but that podcast gets the point across very effectively.

1jajv66,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jajv66,Pay includes PU??,"I accepted this ride because  I was bored and was about to go home. If I got request, it was laughable.  Instant decline. 

The reason why i accepted this one was because i live l in Minnesota and with the new minimum fare  guarantee, I will get $31 more at the end of the 14 day period for this ride. Bringing the total up to $54.23 Round trip. 


Not ideal for a 60 mile trip, but the passenger and I chatted the whole way plus  I got a cup of coffee and a taco that she paid for when we stopped right before her destination. 

AND SHE TIPPED ME! Sadly that’s rare. Before this minimum fare , in 3 1/2 years I’ve only taken three trips to the cities then finally learn my lesson and each was to the airport, which is 70 miles away and I think I got $65 from Uber and not one person tipped. 

My point for this post is…

That all rides Includes pay for pickup. 4 minutes 48 seconds to go .97 of a mile No wait time added. She was waiting for me. So what would that be? Why  don’t they ever show that part of the earnings? What $.30 

Before this new minimum fare kicked in this would still be a normal request.  Every time I got a request that was similar to something like this, it baffled me why would Lyft lowball this? 


The answer of course is a driver would accept it.  The destination was in the Minneapolis market and we cannot operate there so that’s 60 miles $0.38 per mile.

Now, at the end of his first week into carnivore, I did find out he was actually eating some weird things, like: sausages, lunch meat, ""butter"" that was made with olive oil, etc. I realized I'd not been specific enough when I described the diet, and I helped him narrow down things he could eat. I said, stick to food with one single ingredient like actual meat, actual butter, and so on.

By the end of week 3, with no benefits realized, I made him narrow things down to just rib-eye steaks with added fat chunks from the butcher, butter, and 70/30 ground beef. He does snack on cheese here and there.

The only thing outside of carnivore is that he does drink coffee. However, I've always drank coffee myself and never had an issue.

He wasn't trying to lose weight, but he hasn't lost any weight anyway. He says he feels like crap every day, just like he used to when he ate a standard American diet. The only thing he says is different, is that his energy levels are the same from the beginning of the day to the end, rather than the ups and downs of carbs, but he doesn't feel any ""extra"" energy or anything.

I just thought I'd post to ask if anyone has any other advice that I haven't given to him, any encouragement, or reasoning that ya'll could find behind why he's not seeing carnivore benefits.",11,1741891952.0,carnivorediet,15,0.92,False

I have such a difficult time maintaining a routine while living with a partner. I think it may have something to do with how I “ration” my energy/capacity in anticipation of what may be needed/expected of me by others. 

I would love to wake up, do coffee, workout/stretches, tidy up, and then get “the day” started. I will begin but it will last only until the day I am interrupted or something clashes with my timing of said routine. Then I fall off. 

Seems pretty typical of someone with adhd but then there is the aspect of what’s happening in my mind internally. I am thinking about how if I can’t keep it up regularly, then I may has well wait until I can. The “all or nothing” mentality. 

When there is an external factor that is beyond my control, I can’t help but anticipate interruption or even simply being seen/perceived, and it leads to me putting it down completely until I feel like I can (hopefully) begin again.

Their eyes open—not with a sharp, startled breath, but slowly, like something long at rest unfolding. No rush of panic. No weight pressing down on their chest. Just the quiet rhythm of waking. Their mind doesn’t scan for threats, doesn’t brace for tension in the air, doesn’t interpret silence as danger.

They stretch, feeling their body—really feeling it. No stiffness in their jaw. No fingers curled into fists. Their muscles aren’t carrying a fight that isn’t there.

They step out of bed without hesitation, without rehearsing the day in their mind, without mapping out worst-case scenarios. The air in their room feels neutral, maybe even light. They don’t pause before opening the door, expecting unpredictability. There is no expectation of something going wrong.

Walking to the kitchen, they hear the soft sounds of their family stirring. They don’t tense. There is no instinct to decode every sound, no readiness to make themselves smaller. Their mother’s quiet is just quiet—not a warning, not a withdrawal of love.

Their sibling passes them in the hallway, mumbling a sleepy morning. They don’t overanalyze it. Don’t wonder if it’s distant, if they did something wrong. They don’t feel the need to be useful to be worthy.

Sitting at the table, they sip their coffee. Their mind isn’t running ahead, trying to predict, trying to protect. They don’t have to perform. They don’t have to earn their place in the room.

And then they notice the absence.

The absence of fear. The absence of guilt. The absence of needing to be on guard.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Europa Conference League, where dreams are made, and Thursday nights are filled with the sweet symphony of underdog stories. Today, we have Fiorentina hosting Panathinaikos in what promises to be a clash of epic proportions—or at least a decent excuse to avoid doing laundry.

Fiorentina, with odds around 1.43 to 1.45, are the clear favorites. They have been as reliable at home as a Wi-Fi connection in a coffee shop, winning three of their last four matches at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. However, let's not forget they've also lost five of their previous six appearances, which makes them about as consistent as my New Year's resolutions.

Panathinaikos, on the other hand, are priced at a juicy 7.5. They've been struggling on the road, failing to win any of their last seven away games. But hey, if you're feeling lucky and believe in the power of a good old-fashioned upset, this might be your moment. After all, underdogs win about 41% of the time in baseball and hockey, so why not channel some of that energy into soccer?

Now, for my best bet: Fiorentina to win & Both teams to score at 11/4 with Pribet. This bet has the perfect blend of optimism and realism, much like ordering a salad with a side of fries. Fiorentina should take the win, but Panathinaikos might just sneak in a goal to keep things interesting.

I was lurking on here & everyone seems so friendly - I’m a little overwhelmed & would really appreciate some advice!

I’ll be moving to Seattle from Central California later this year for work (this isn’t a maybe, I definitely will be moving) and wanted some advice on which neighborhoods might be a good fit for me. 

Some background information: 
I’m single, female, in my late 20s. I enjoy being around nature & greenery (think walks, runs, picnics) but I’m not particularly avid about hardcore adventuring/sports if that makes sense. Like most people, I find being able to chill near water (lakes, beaches, rivers) very relaxing. My hobbies are mostly indoor-based, but I’m actually quite extroverted so I like having some proximity to where the action is — I enjoy going out & trying new food & activities with friends. I am also a big coffee addict lol. 

Some practical things: 
Wherever I live, I need to be able to commute to the Capitol Hill area in a reasonable amount of time (30 minutes driving being the most I want to do in the morning, I don’t really care about how long the evening drive back is). I would ideally like to spend around $2k a month on rent for a decently spacious 1 bedroom (a 2 bedroom would be amazing but I know it’s not really realistic). I can go up to $2.5k if I have to for a nicer/safer area to live in. No pets but maybe a small dog in the future (not a requirement). I would like to be able to walk around my neighborhood on nicer days (something I can’t currently comfortably do in my current neighborhood due to crime rates & general poorly developed infrastructure for walking). 

Sorry this was so long & thank you for sticking with me! Let me know if you need any more information. I know it will be hard to get everything I’m asking for in one area but I’m hoping y’all can guide me in the right direction (I heard Greenlake or West Seattle might be a decent fit for me, for example). I would really appreciate any other insight you may have that may help me with my move / adjusting to culture changes (eg: which dating app reigns supreme in Seattle, running clubs, etc) 

I am super excited for my move & while I know it’ll be a big change I’m hopeful it’ll be a smooth transition (with my sunlamp & vitamin D supplements!)

It’s simple. We met in a library, we had five dates—a sixth one was planned. Things got in the way. We talked on and off for about 10 months and now we don’t talk anymore. 
Then it gets complicated. When I saw her in the library, she had this beautiful, flowing white dress on with this shiny bead necklace. Honestly, she looked like she had just been to a wedding, and for me it was love at first sight—I took one look and it felt like I had known her for my entire life. She looked perfect and was my type, all the way down to her short curly hair. If I could describe her aesthetic, it’s cottagecore. I walked up to her and told her that I thought she was cute and I was interested in getting to know her better. She puts her hands to her cheeks and gasps, then gives me her WhatsApp and Instagram.
We had our first date. We walked in a field, talked, then had a picnic in a park where we discovered we share the same humor. Second date went just as smoothly. Third date, I bought us these love heart lollipops, and when I surprised her with one, she went all red and kept thanking me
After the fourth date, we didn’t see each other for a while, but we’d text frequently. It was up until about two months when we had our fifth date. We shared an umbrella, grabbed some coffee, went clothe shopping. We agreed to do mini golf, but I guess things got in the way and we never ended up doing it. 
I had thought it was over, so a little while later I got into a relationship with my most recent ex. Abused me to no end, but throughout the relationship, I still thought about this girl, and honestly I was still in love with her. As I mentioned, she and I would talk on and off, and after a while of not texting, I asked if we could call and we did—called at like 3am and talked until 5, just going over all the reasons I should break up with my girlfriend at the time. Bear in mind I was pretty drunk throughout this convo, but idk if she picked up on it. She told me she was meant to have gone to sleep at like 1am but was happy to talk to me. I regret it but I stayed with this girl for a couple more months. 

We hardly talked after this, and then came the darkest period in my life so far where everything just came crashing down. I texted her about it sometime around midnight and even though she didn’t know how to help, she still talked to me and told me I didn’t deserve what was going on. I just apologize if I was ever a dick, she reassured me I wasn’t. A cop car cruising by picked me up from where I was. The last message I ever sent her was a photo of me in the back of their car as they took me home. She didn’t respond and I lost access to my Instagram account, so I can’t message her. 

Today, her Instagram account is private and I’m using a completely, and although I have her WhatsApp, I don’t know if it’s appropriate to text her there, and I’m not even sure it’s okay to speak to her. It’s been 6 months since our last conversation. As far as I know, she’s in university and I just wanted to work right out of the gate. In May, it would’ve been 2 years since we first met and gone on our first date. 
I don’t exactly idealize her, I know her flaws and abilities; strengths and weaknesses, but I want her despite those things. 
Each time I’ve been like “okay I’m going to meet new people”, it’s never gone well for me and I’m never 100% there because my mind is always on this girl. ",1,1741891125.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend and i will be landing in Dublin early September 19, flying out October 1. Seems like everyone on this subreddit has the same idea for a trip. Start in Dublin, head west, galway/cliffs, head south. We were thinking of spending time in and around dongle as well, which seems well southwest. 

For activities we love strong coffee, spooky weather, delicious meals (love near NYC so always looking for the best of the best food), and obviously we expect to test if guinness is better in ireland. We want to meet irish people, taste irish dairy, and see live rock/punk music. Neither of us has any irish heritage but we would love to immerse ourselves for a bit and experience the majesty or ireland.

I say all that to say this: Is there any way to add a side-trip to Scotland in the mix? We would love to see Edinburgh and Glasgow, but have little interest in the rest of the UK, so would be ideal to add it to the trip to Ireland, as that’s the closest we’ll ever be for a while. I looked into flying to Edinburgh from shannon airport, but there’s no convenient option, so we’ll likely have to travel to/from Dublin.

Does this seem feasible? Dublin/galway/cliffs/dingle/southern ireland, back to dublin to head to scotland, to head back to dublin to head home? 

Should we try going straight to Scotland, then work our way around Ireland? Should we head straight to Galway and do the western part first, head to scotland, and end the trip with a day or two in Dublin?

Just trying to open a dialogue to discuss this trip in greater detail and make it what it needs to be. Thoughts woild be greatly appreciated.

My question is : am I supposed to leave them all together? Or do I need to separate each little ""tree""? I had a Coleus plant kit that advised to put them all together but as they started to grow, they began to die and I was told they were supposed to be separated so they could grow independently. Once I separated them, they flourished beautifully. 
So, is that what I'm supposed to do in this situation? Or is this the way they're supposed to grow? 
Typically I do my research before I purchase any plants so I know how to care for them and what to expect. But in this situation I took a gamble on a mystery bundle. (Which I actually loved because I got a pink syngonium, polka dot plant, and the coffee plant. All 3 I adore!)

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

Sleepless nights and stubborn pounds—sounds like a recipe for frustration, doesn’t it?

If you’ve been losing more patience than weight, the culprit might be your sleep (or lack thereof). Poor sleep doesn’t just leave you groggy; it also messes with your metabolism, making weight loss feel like pushing a boulder uphill.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

**""Jesus is for the broken.""**

Jesus never died on this Earth just for you to desperately grasp at reasons your sin is justified. Jesus never died just for you to stay lusting after those women. Jesus never died for you to just grasp at the littlest thread of why your lust for the same sex is justifiable. Jesus never died just for you to keep mocking others with God's Holy Word and why you are better than them—because you are not. You are just as broken as the man you are ridiculing. You are no spotless, shameless little angel. You are a rotten sinner, and if you do not see that in yourself, may God help you find the truth.

We think that just because we go to church, do community service, love our wife, love our country, and—oh, how we love our God—that makes us the little spotless lamb that God intended and allows us to be stuck up and boastful in our mindset. But you are no better than the Satanist who has never tasted what grace is.

If you think that doing good works, resisting that little look at porn that one time, comparing yourself to that gay man you saw at Starbucks—the one you always try to avoid at all costs from serving you—and when he does, you try and force that NKJV Bible talk into any nook of the words you possibly can, and going to your boastfully correct church is the Gospel, then you, my future sibling, are gravely mistaken.

Nothing you do with works, even in the name of God our Father or Christ Jesus His Son, no matter how long you try to make yourself look like that God-loving and—oh, how God-fearing—Christian, will save you without ever accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior. So may God help you.

If you have never accepted Him as your Lord and Savior, you can do it right there in your seat at home, in your office at work, or in your chair at school like I am right now. You do not need a physical Bible with you. You don't need to go to your local pastor this second to be saved. All you need to do is recognize that you are a sinner in desperate need of saving, which can only be fulfilled through Christ Jesus. You don't need to be feeling a rush of emotion right now, but it is okay if you are. All you need is the realization that you are a down-dirty sinner.

Romans 10:9-10 says, *""If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.""* (NIV)

You will still fall into temptation and sin countless times. Repent (ask for forgiveness and turn from your ways) and ask God for His forgiveness. Being saved is not a ""get out of jail free"" card that allows you to sin with no need to repent. Also, you won't one day wake up and magically no longer have that temptation or sin. It will be through hard work, pain, prayer, and constant repentance that you will overcome it. Christianity is not an easy road—for if it were, you would be no different in your own twisted sin than that gay man serving you coffee.

We should love everyone, no matter how uncomfortable they may make us feel. 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 explains how we should love perfectly:

*""If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.""*

What it means here by ""love"" is not ""go and bang them later"" or ""accept them for who they are."" It is quite the opposite. I'll give an example of what type of love this does **not** mean:

*You walk up to the gay man at the counter. You stick your nose up with your shiny, $300 full silver cross dangling harshly on your chest. You tell him your order with a smug tone and a sly face. You don't say a single word about the Gospel to him. You just show him how good of a Christian you are. He calls your name, and as you go and grasp the coffee in his hands, you say,* **""You know I am a Christian, right? I'm only showing you what a prime example of a Christian you could be if you just stopped being gay and went to church.""** *And with a quick chuckle, you rip it from his hands and walk away, confident that you got another guaranteed saved man from the fiery pits of hell—something you can tell your elite Bible study group back at church. You are so proud of yourself.*

This is obviously exaggerated, but it is a prime example of a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. These types of stuck-up Christians do not help anyone spiritually in reality—not even themselves. They are only another noisy person, just screaming about their religion, ready to post on Reddit about how they were attacked by another Christian.

We need to be truly loving. That does not mean accepting whatever pronouns they want, but it does mean not treating them as less than a human being. Think of your greatest sin out of the seven deadly sins. Now think of theirs. They don’t get a ""worse than straight seven deadly gay sins""—they are on the same exact plane of reality as us. They are lost, as we once were.",62,1741890431.0,TrueChristian,106,0.66,False

Their concoctions they call ""Coffee"" is the most sugary, sweet, hard to drink I've ever had. Almost threw up after trying their ""Caramelizer"" which a caramel mocha, then they promote the ""911"" drink which is 6 FUCKING SHOTS OF ESPRESSO. 

The worst part about this is that they market it towards children, with such names as ""POPPIN' BOBA HYPERCHROME REBEL!"" or ""BROWNIE BATTER FREEZE!"", it's so evil. I have met 2 children who got a large drink and had to go to the hospital due to caffeine overload, and I know them personally, Not a kid off of discord or any social media's.

The way they make the drinks as well is just disgusting. They have a whole assortment of syrups and more. Their most popular drink, the golden Eagle has over 95 grams of caffeine, red bull has 111 a 16 gram difference? It's still a lot of caffeine. But their cocomo? a Coconut and Mocha latte? A large cocomo has 190 grams of caffeine. The 911? a size SMALL has over 288 GRAMS OF FUCKING CAFFEINE. This is coming from THEIR source as well. not a third party. not some journalist from Yahoo or some shit. this is from them. 

If you want coffee. Just make a pot yourself at home, or go to Starbucks for all I care, and before you say "" oH wEIL yOu shoLd kNow hOw muCh caffEine is on iT!"" yeah. you should. but it's Same thing with sugar, same thing with carbs, same thing with any damn nutrition value.

I have stayed strong with those and realized that it has helped me a lot with my spending habits! no-buy in the past has always felt like a punishment for me, until now. 

This paycheck I am paying off my credit cards in full for the second time since november, and I am tired of this cycle where i super-spend, then get anxious and start putting things on my credit card, and get caught in a vicous cycle. I want this to be the last time I have to waste money paying off my credit cards for purchases I made last month. 

My goal is for the next 2.5 months (the rest of March, April, and May) to do a low-buy so I don’t feel super restricted. I keep my living expenses separately from my discretionary expenses, so this is mostly focused on those. 

These are my rules: 

- no clothes 
- no makeup or skincare (exceptions for replacements) 
- no shower products or lotion unless it’s a replacement 
- no books (the saddest one, but i have so many unread) 
- no hobby items 
- no buying lunch at work 

low buys: 

- dates and dinner/drinks with my friends 2-3 times per month 
- $10 or less can be spent on a treat like a coffee or ice cream out 2 times per week at most 
- experiences 
- birthday/wedding/baby gifts for others 

what do y’all think? my goal is to re-fill my emergency fund as i had to deplete it for a large vet expense at the beginning of February. I would also love to work on just being better at having sinking funds and knowing i have money for things rather than spending on a whim.

**Saved Responses Now Include Ban Messages - Coming Soon**

Mods have long wielded the ban hammer, and now you can do it with a little more efficiency. In the coming weeks, Saved Responses will work with banned messages, meaning you can craft the perfect “This is where we part ways” message once and reuse it forever. Or, if you’re feeling generous, you can personalize your farewells. Either way, fewer repetitive keystrokes for you and (hopefully) more clarity for those on their way out

**Community Guide Now Available Everywhere**

For years, u/welcomebot has been the friendly neighborhood bot, greeting new users and helping them find their footing in your communities. But the time has come for them to retire at the end of the month.

Their successor? The [Community Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1cnacle/new_tools_to_help_mods_educate_and_inform/), now available across all platforms, provides new users with an easier way to learn about your subreddit’s rules and expectations, helping them get involved the right way from day one.

So, let’s take a moment to recognize u/welcomebot, a bot that served well and now gets a [well-earned rest](https://i.redd.it/v2kptm0v4aoe1.gif).

**Automation Enhancements - Coming Soon**

Over the course of this year, we’ll be working on new ways to make Post & Comment Guidance more useful and insightful. More control, more flexibility, and fewer question marks about whether your automations are actually working. Over the coming weeks and months, you can expect the following feature improvements:

* **User & post flair integration:** Automations will soon be able to recognize and act based on user and post flair, giving you more flexibility on how you manage different groups of users. 
* **Conditional stacking:** More advanced logic options are on the way, letting you set up automations that consider multiple factors before taking action. 
* **Effectiveness insights:** Ever set up an automation and thought, “Is this actually doing anything?” Soon, you won’t have to guess—you’ll get insights into how well your automations are performing.
* **Adding is\_top\_comment:** New functionality to recognize whether a comment is a top comment, helping refine automation decisions.
* **Adding support for different post types:** Automations will be able to distinguish between text, link, image, and video posts for more tailored responses.

These features will roll out over the coming weeks and months. We’ll keep you updated as they go live, and as always, we welcome your feedback.

1jaixfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/0sanitymemes/comments/1jaixfy/love_review_eblana_dublinn/,Love Review: Eblana Dublinn,"https://preview.redd.it/ssm1qyb72ioe1.jpg?width=2046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef367ef1b64edc172f78e5a6a465ba39b3886f70

Ugh… please, I wanna sleep a little longer\~

  
But the morning sun doesn’t listen to my pleas. Its soft, gentle rays beam through the curtains, bathing the Red Dragon’s den in a warm, orange glow. Mmm… I should get up… but this bed is so comfy…

  
My eyelids felt like iron, and my body like lead. With every movement, I felt that pleasurable ache wracking my entire frame, a reminder of what happened last night. Of the adrenaline-infused primal lovemaking session that hellcat of a Draco subjected me to. It was simply put, divine, and even now I get shudders of delight recalling those precious memories. Once my eyes are open, I take a look on my right side, and there she was. Eblana Dublinn, one of the last pureblooded Dracos on Terra, sleeping peacefully with her tail curled around herself for protection. She looked so serene, cute even, with that three-meter long draconic appendage in that position. It takes some effort to stand up, both because my body was still hurting, and my intent on not disturbing the princess. Slowly but surely, I manage to put on my boxers, then sneak out of bed, but before heading to the bathroom… I take another look at Eblana. Should I cover her up? Her hot blood should keep her warm throughout the cold mornings of Tara, but I don’t want her to catch a cold. Can Dracos even catch a cold? Let’s not find out.

  
With deft movements, the princess finds herself covered in a shield of cloth and wool to protect her from the elements. That should do it. Now… time to change my bandages. Every step towards the bedroom was accompanied by a hiss of pain, at least until I got used to the sensation. If the stinging sensation wasn’t enough, I also had to dodge the implements used last night. Manacles, chains, and that damn iron collar… some stained red. Cleaning up the mess in the room would be really annoying too… maybe I’ll deal with that later.

  
Thankfully, Eblana placed the medkit from last night where it belonged, that being on one of the bathroom’s walls. I take out the disinfectant, bandages and whatever else was required, and prepare to replace the bandages. Let’s begin with those wrapped around my arms first. They come off easily, and I get to admire the Draco’s handiwork by looking in the nearby mirror. Scratches. A lot of them, but none of them are deep, thankfully, and the markings of the manacles, when they dug in a little too deep. A little bit of disinfectant here and there, and it’s done. But man, I really don’t enjoy that stinging sensation.

  
Next up, I have to deal with the more… complicated wounds on my thighs and upper legs. Again, only scratches, but there were some cuts from Eblana’s tail-fins too. That’s easy to deal with, again, the same treatment as before. But now comes the hard part: my torso. Unlike my arms and legs, who took only the light part of the Draco experience, my torso took the full brunt of it. Even unwrapping the damn bandages hurt, and for a good reason: the princess tore into me like a bloodthirsty, savage beast. Scratches? Check. Bite marks? Check. Bruises from tail-whips? Check. Oh no, those weren’t only scratches. No no, they were also accompanied by some deep lacerations too. Yet… when I recall the events of our previous night, I genuinely don’t mind them. Not one bit.

  
The Draco was pent-up from having to deal with those annoying noblemen of Na Saorisi for so long. While the younger Dublinn twin, Loughshinny, also had to deal with the same issue, a lot of the time, those noblemen had to pass through her older sister first. And rather than succumb to her latent draconic bloodlust, she instead opted to de-stress via a sparring session with me. Turns out, that if you feed the fire instead of quenching it, you get the situation where a fight in the training room isn’t enough, so you need to take it to the bedroom too. And boy, what a fight that was! For the first time, she proposed we use safewords. I didn’t think those were needed, I mean, we’ve had plenty of rough sex and BSDM sessions without them. Why would we need those now? Turns out, those safewords were in fact needed. Once we got down to business, the Draco simply said “I want you to resist me. Don’t submit without a fight. Make. Me. Work. For. It.” And the rest is just a flurry of tails, teeth and nails until I screamed out for mercy.

  
Yet, when I recall how hard she bit me, how her nails raked down my back and chest, how her tail choked me, kept me close to her at all times… Ah, sweet chills. But maybe the best part was the aftercare session. How Eblana tended to the grievous wounds she inflicted one by one, putting the skills she learned from her twin to their best use. Once my session of fantasizing is done, I try my best to get those damn lacerations wrapped up again. It hurt plenty, especially when disinfecting them, but at last, I’m done. Maybe… just maybe, I should’ve told her to stop earlier. Too late for regrets now, though, I’m stuck looking like I fought a Clawbeast bare-handed and lost. Shambling my way into the bedroom once more, I take a long look at the sleeping princess.

  
Maybe… I should prepare breakfast for her? The Draco is not a morning person by any means, and I’m sure she’d appreciate the gesture. Although… she might also get upset that I wandered about in her quarters without telling her first. At the same time… this is a win-win situation for me. If she enjoys the food, I’ll be happy. If she punishes me, I’ll be happy too… depending on the punishment, of course.

  
I try to stretch a little, but unfortunately my body doesn’t allow me such luxury. The wounds ache at every sudden movement, and I give up on the idea. Ugh. Time to get the princess something to eat. But… what does she eat? I’ve seen her plenty of times at the cantina of the Gastrell, having the same meals as other soldiers. But at the same time, she’s nobility, so her standards might be a bit above what me and others consider palatable…

  
Well, enough time wasted on overthinking unnecessary things. I turn heel and head out for the part of her quarters that resembles a kitchen. Let’s not rush it, and not dig too deep in those cupboards. Only use what you have in the fridge and at hand. What would be considered a good breakfast for her? I really have no idea… but you can never go wrong with sandwiches. Speaking of them, there’s some of that bread? I think that’s how you call it. You fold it, place stuff in the middle and eat, said stuff being meat, vegetable and even Gaulish fries. Add the desired sauce, and you have something really tasty.



With the strange bread placed on a plate, I open the fridge to check on what I’m working with. It’s… surprisingly tame? I want to say. Nothing fancy, in fact, the contents look the same as mine, save for the fact they are ordered and not in utter chaos. Some cheese and ham would do just fine for what I have planned.

  
The first step is slicing the bread in two, then cutting some thin strips of ham and cheese. Those would be placed on the two pieces of bread, and considering how thin it is, rolled up nicely. But that doesn’t cut it. No, I’d need to heat them up just a little bit, so the cheese inside melts, giving it a much needed flavor. As for drinks? Tea. I don’t know whether the Draco drinks coffee or not, cause I certainly couldn’t find any proof of that, so tea it is.



While I set the water to boil, those rolls find themselves sentenced to the press toaster. Gotta be careful, lest I set the entire kitchen on fire. Like it happened before, back in my first dorm. Thankfully, this time, the Catastrophe was avoided, The teapot hisses, and the sizzling of the rolls indicate they’re done. I take them out, place them on a fancy-looking plate, grab a cup for the tea, then another problem arises. Should I sweeten it? Sugar? Or maybe… honey. I do recall seeing a jar lying around. Two teaspoons should be enough, I say to myself.

  
With everything packed up, I go back to where the princess was sleeping. To nobody’s surprise, the hissing of the teapot woke her up. Eblana made no effort in covering her nudity, letting her ivory locks spill over her chest to censor her naughty bits.

  
“Good morning, Leader. Did you rest well?”

  
“I don’t remember giving you permission to prance around my private quarters like you own the place.” the Draco hissed in a raspy voice. Despite her harshness, there was no real venom behind her words. Her energy was at an all-time low in the mornings.

  
“I apologize, Leader. I thought you’d appreciate it if I prepared breakfast for you.”

  
“Apologies accepted. I’m not going to be upset over something as trivial as that. But do not expect I return the favor,” Eblana continued, pushing aside the bed covers just enough so she could stand up properly. Taking the invitation, I present her what I’ve prepared, and take my place by her side. But no, she wouldn’t have me standing up next to her. The Draco instead patted the free place on the bed besides her with her tail. “You’ve changed your bandages on your own too, I assume?”

  
How can I say no to that!? I move over to where she indicated, and sit down next to her. The next five minutes were spent in complete silence while the Draco ate what I made for her. It was quite hard to tell if she enjoyed it or not, but considering the princess left nothing on her plate, I say I did quite well in that regard.

  
“A bit heavy for breakfast, and the tea was too sweet. Other than that…” Eblana placed the plate on the closest nighstand, then turned around to face me. “It was tasty. Thank you.”

  
“I’m happy you liked it, Leader”

  
But before I could say anything more, I felt her tail wrap around my waist. This time though, the way it held me close was… a bit different. She was oddly relaxed, or at least trying to appear as relaxed as possible. Next thing I know, the Draco was right up in my face, aquamarine orbs blazing with emotions I didn’t know she could show.

  
“Why did you go out of your way to serve me breakfast?” she asked, voice as serious as ever.

  
“Must I have a reason, Leader? After a night as intense as that, I thought that you’d appreciate such a gesture. After all, you know I’ve had feelings for you...” And that was it. I didn’t do it for any other reason. Yet, despite my honesty, Eblana’s tail-hold tightened ever so slightly. What could’ve gotten such a reaction from her?

  
“Even after how much I’ve hurt you during sex, how I reject every little bit of affection you offer… you still chase after me? You’re loyal to a fault, a good boy who could win others’ hearts by those virtues alone. What interests you so much in an ice queen like me?” The princess ranted on, eyes fixating me and never moving. I must’ve struck a nerve or something, or maybe she wasn’t used to someone doing things she would like without demanding compensation down the line. The first time I’ve confessed to her about how I truly felt, she simply waved me away, with the words “You and I cannot be together. Not in Victoria. Not in Tara. Our enemies will inevitably see our relationship as something to exploit.”

  
While the sting of rejection still felt fresh, I didn’t give up yet. I knew we would never be equals, and this relation of master-servant was… quite nice, in all honesty, but I wanted more. Haha, now that I think about it, it’s me that’s the greedy one, not the Draco…

  
“What do you see me as? Do you perhaps see me as a broken, wounded woman who needs love to heal? A monster to take pity on? Or…” her voice went quiet, gaining a dangerous edge to it. Eblana’s nails dug into the mattress, the grip of her tail tightening ever so slightly. “...as a dragon to be tamed?”

  
Seeing her in such a state made my heart ache. I had to do something about it. But before giving her the answer, I took her right hand into mine. She was tense. So very tense that it felt like a viper about to strike.

  
“It’s none of that, Leader. I see you as a fiery, ambitious woman. Unfettered. Untamed, with a will of iron. The epitome of power and conquest.” I respond, looking her straight in her eyes. To hammer the point home, I lead her hand to my throat, where her sharp nails hover over my thrumming pulse point. “I would never treat you as anything else but that. If I go astray, then please, end my life with your own hands.”

  
“You…!” Her eyes flashed with primal madness, sharp nails almost piercing the skin. Just when I thought she’d end me right here and now, she instead caressed that spot with gentle, yet dangerous touches. “It’s been how long since we’ve known each other?”

  
“Six years, Leader.” I stammer out a response, chills running down my spine. Those touches of hers felt ethereal, but still conveyed a feeling of dread, as if she could dig her fingers in at any given point.

  
“It’s been seven. Seven years, and you managed to melt my heart.” Eblana purred, unwrapping her tail from my waist. But this was far from over, as she immediately pushed me down onto the bed. Ah! For crying out loud! Landing on my back caused the lacerations that she left to hurt so much! And if that wasn’t enough, she straddled my hips and pinned me down with her surprisingly strong, lithe frame.

  
“What a delightful reaction\~ Well, since that’s how you see me, I am willing to give this relationship a chance. But make no mistakes… hurt my heart in any way, and there will be nothing left of you to bury!” she spat venomously.

“I wouldn’t dare, Leader.”

  
“I have a name. While we are alone, I am Eblana to you. Not the Leader of Dublinn.” The Draco leaned in just bit more just so our lips were one centimeter away from touching.

  
“Very well, Le- no, Eblana. Let’s walk through our lives… together.” For the first time, I felt bold enough to cup her chin and pull her into a soft kiss. However, she immediately retaliated by taking a hold of my head from behind and leaving me breathless with a passionate, intense kiss, all teeth and tongue.

  
“You’ll be held responsible for those words, dearest.” And with that, she descended upon me again and again, showering me the messiest affection only a Draco can do. Soft kisses, kitten licks, tail-wraps and nibbles with her sharp canines, the full experience. But unlike before, her cold exterior was slowly melting away, letting her fiery interior out to play.

1jaiveg,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1jaiveg/not_looking_forward_to_sharing_the_news_with_mil/,Not looking forward to sharing the news with MIL about first grandkid on the weekend,"I posted on here a while back (January?) about the issues I have with my MIL, like her forgetting my name, making comments to my partner in front of me about how he doesn't need to share his inheritance with me on Christmas day, how we did IVF and she was not overly supportive, how she makes comments under her breath (like 'he is going to IMPREGNANTE her,' or 'are we seriously going to be associated to these people?' aka my family), but ultimately deleted it because I showed my DH the comments and he was hurt. However, it was extremely helpful because he realized that what he calls 'jokes' are not funny, and he needs to stick up for me moving forward. So that's all good.

Fast forward to now, I am almost 9 weeks pregnant, and we are happy as can be, but I have not seen his parents since the day after Christmas. We also haven't told them the good news yet, as we were waiting for our 7-week scan and confirmation of a heartbeat. She has called my DH a few times earlier on after the IVF implantation asking if ""we have any news for her?' but lately they have given us our time and space.

They have invited us for dinner nearly every week for the past 4 weeks, and I've been using the excuse of severe nausea and vomiting to not go over there, which is true - I've been really knocked out these weeks. Firstly, I have no desire to go for dinner, as my nausea and vomiting get worse in the evenings, and I haven't been able to eat much dinner, never mind sit at a meat-heavy formal dining setup - that they usually like to have. I often end up helping clean up, but I have no interest in doing that while I'm sick. I spoke to my DH, and we agreed that a quick afternoon visit will be better. But I am still dreading it.

I know it's because of all the weird comments and snarky things she's said and done thus far disguised as jokes or covered under the guise of politeness. I have been extremely kind, turned a blind eye, and tried hard to form a close connection with her, but something always ends up rubbing me the wrong way. I'm also the kind of person who is quick to cut off people who make me feel uncomfortable or bad about myself.  I used to be excited to tell them about our pregnancy, as we had been trying for over a year, and  IVF took us about 6 months. I envisioned getting them cute grandparent's T-shirts as a surprise or something, but since our interactions on Christmas, I've been dreading having any contact with her. We will probably just bring over our ultrasound picture, and hopefully, my partner will do the talking.

I've thought about grey stoning her, but how do you do that when announcing something you are so happy and excited about? Their other child is disabled so this is their only shot at being grandparents, and I know they see their friends and their grandkids and are looking forward to that themselves. I am thinking of either going in there with fake happiness and cheer, guarding my heart for the next snarky or dismissive thing she does, and not getting my hopes up thinking that things are fine now. Or just let my partner take the lead, or a combination of both. Either way, I'm nervous about how to navigate this space moving forward, and knowing myself, it will be hard to pretend that everything is okay.

The other frustrating thing is their ultra formal behaviour. We have never gone over there just to hang out, and they have never visited us in our condo. I have never gone out with her one-on-one and only have spoken to her alone when her husband or son was not there (once, maybe twice). It has only ever been formal dinners. I wish they were a lot more casual, or she could come visit us at our condo for a coffee, or she and I could do lunch, a facial, or shopping sometime. But she never extended an invitation  (despite telling us about her facial appointments), and it never seemed like a good idea to me - I guess it was an intuition thing. This will most likely be challenging postpartum because the only way they'll see their grandkid is after I'm up and feeling good enough to travel and go see THEM, which means no help from them in our place, too, if nothing changes. We live in a condo and don't have a formal dining table, and while we do plan on upgrading to a house in the next year, we aren't there yet, however we have two clean couches, and that should not deter them as my mother, father, and brother have all managed to visit us.

I'm also nervous about how she will be now that we are bringing grandkids into the mix. I'm holding steadfast to my boundaries with everything, and my DH will support me. And I hope for her sake, she can stick to being nice to me because I don't want her to miss out on seeing our baby when it comes because I don't want to be around her.

The other thing I could do is, again, brush everything from the past under the rug, start fresh, and be open minded and kind, and THIS time if she says anythin, I can call her out on it and make a bit of a fuss, communicate that what she said is disrespectful. However, to me this causes more problems in the long run, and I tend to avoid confrontation in situations where I am not comfortable with the person and/or there's an uneven power dynamic.

Sorry for rambling on so much, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to conduct myself the next time we see her and share the news, and moving forward. I also know some MILs can become even more incited when babies and kids are in the picture, so I am apprehensive given that.

**Update:** I appreciate the insight everyone has said here, or DM'd me. Have discussed things with my SO, and said this specifically: ""*I’ll be there with you when you tell them the news. I really want this to be a happy moment, but I also know that in the past, certain comments have made me feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. So, I just want to be upfront that if any rude comments are made, or if I feel uncomfortable, I’d like us to leave. I want to protect my peace and enjoy this time*"", and thankfully, he agrees. We got them some cute ""promoted to grandma/grandpa"" mugs and will go there with a positive attitude but aware of boundaries. Hoping it goes positively..",15,1741890200.0,JUSTNOMIL,18,0.9,False

1jais6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1jais6l/having_the_right_mindset_really_does_make_a/,Having the right mindset really does make a difference - fix those dopamine receptors!,"Smoked age 17 - 21, vaped all day every day since 21, now saying hello to 30 with a son on the way. 13 years of slavery ends here.

I've tried to quit 4-7 times over the past 2 months, and one has finally stuck, here's how it went:

Attempt 1: Cold turkey - lasted 1.5 days, the in-laws family drama pulled me back in

Attempt 2: NRT gum/spray - roughly 6 hours lmao, the spray is horrible.

Attempt 3: Allen Carrs Easy Way - 2.5 days, cravings hit bad on day 3, I wasn't de-programmed yet, grabbed a vape walking the dog.

Then a few mini attempts using a mix of different things, nothing stuck.

Attempt 4ish (current): Days 1-3 - Using what I learned from the Easy Way book, and the fact that I was so disappointed in myself for failing so many times, I stopped again, cold turkey, and actually did not want to vape, the satisfaction from vaping started turning into ""ugh, time to vape"". I've had no withdrawals, no cravings, it seems the Easy Way worked but not when it was supposed to. Essentially I was so sick of letting the nicotine control me that I WANTED to stop.

Day 4: Went to the office which is a massive trigger as I love my little vape breaks. Craved hard, my smoking buddy is also quitting so she helped push me through. Never have i drank so much water. Read up about all the things nicotine does to fry your dopamine receptors and basically makes nothing feel good other than vaping, and the cravings completely left, I want my dopamine fixed!

This is actually a driving factor of this quitting attempt, realising that nicotine has been in control of my happiness and dopamine levels for essentially my whole adult life, and makes me wonder what other sources of happiness and reward I've missed out on and not shown excitement where it's been needed. Hell, i tiptoed around my own wedding day to get a few nicotine hits in, though good times were still had, smoking with my closest humans.
Anyway, green tea kept me sane, and around 15 imperial mints lmao. Made it back home without failing myself, no cravings back at home.

Day 5: Pretty chill day at home, small craving when I went for a drive which is also a trigger, but soon faded after turning my music up and having a small rave in the car. Found an old vape in my drawer, chuckled and threw it in the bin, nice try! 

Knowing that nicotine has essentially been evacuated from my body by now, there's no way I'm falling back into the trap. Keep that dopamine in mind, the brain is finally repairing itself, don't send it back into a battle with nicotine and the fake dopamine trojan horse.

Day 6: in the office again. Morning was much easier than the last office day, had lunch and the cravings came back. I'm now a green tea connoisseur, trying all the flavours to find a new addiction. Drinking hot drinks when they're just slightly too hot seems to help, and the caffeine is also a plus. Also made a new friend at the coffee machine, I guess that's where the non smokers hang out. Today made me realise just how frazzled i was on my last office day, this was a breeze in comparison.

The nicotine monster tried to bargain with me again, saying ""oh just vape at work, you know the withdrawals aren't that bad now, just don't vape at home"". As tempting as it was, I managed to shoo it away, and filled my boots with bake sale leftovers, sorry not sorry.
The thing is, I probably could do it, but the vape creep would eventually enter my home again, I'll accidently leave it in my pocket and one night I'll think ""oh, my vapes upstairs, one cheeky one won't hurt"", and then I'm back to sucking on it day and night. Also, don't want to reset the dopamine progress.

Alright that's enough journalling, I think at this point I know I'll be able to manage, and hopefully for anyone thinking of quitting, there's a bit of insight for you to help you along the way. Just stay busy, and find ways to satisfy the cravings/push them out. 

It's only been 6 days and it already feels much easier, it's crazy that I used to fear going even an hour without vaping, I was absolutely brainwashed.

1jairs3,https://v.redd.it/ugr81gh31ioe1,Partner finally acknowledging enmeshed family. Is cutting them off the right thing to do?,"His [39M] mom has hated me [38F] from day 1. After only meeting her a couple times, dating 1.5 years, partner, a sr in college, his mom told him I’m going to trap him by getting pregnant. He felt the need to always defend and protect her, not me. We were married 14 years and all throughout I was undermined by her, she’d make jokes, subtly putting me down in front of my kids, she’d make comments about how dirty my house was. She’d complain about my cat (she hates cats). She actually pressured us into getting rid of our first cat together. She took him to the shelter while we were on our honeymoon.. she kept her son on the phone with her the entire honeymoon. We divorced ultimately because I could not stand being second to his parents. She even asked him if she was the reason for our divorce. She acted sad. She told him she was so afraid he’d be alone forever. He told me when he started seeing someone after our divorce she told him SHE wasn’t ready. As if it was her decision. When he told her he went out for a coffee date with an ex from high school she told him not to get involved with her again. Turns out she just doesn’t like him to be with ANYONE but her. We ended up getting back together. His parents are not happy about it. All the stuff she did throughout the marriage I could be ok with if my partner set boundaries. It’s the stuff they tried doing during and after the divorce that makes me never want to see them again. They have money and connections. His dad is not a social person. But his dad tried to reach out to someone he hasn’t spoken to in years who’s close with the district attorney just to tell him all about me to see if there’s any way I could be charged with anything at all. I’ve never in my life done anything illegal. But his goal was to take me from my kids permanently. He also got a real estate friend to give him a blank lease agreement so he can falsify a document for my partner during our divorce saying my partner pays him money for a house they bought him. He pays $0 but he was trying to get him out of paying me anything. I was very financially vulnerable at this point. I’d only ever been a sahm so I had no work history or experience for a decent enough job to cover 4 kids on my own out the gates. My partner made 6 figures. Their goal was to make me homeless and take my kids from me. I actually did live in my van for 2 weeks. His mom would do things here and there like telling our 4 yo “only grandma and daddy can help you in the bathroom.” I had done nothing to these people in all the 18 years I’ve known them. Nothing. Even my partner says I didn’t do anything wrong. I don’t understand why they hate me so much. Now that we’re back together my partner is standing by my side 100%. So he asked his parents for space so we can focus on our relationship/family, seeing that they were a massive problem for us from the beginning. He really thought they respected him enough to understand. So far they’ve showed up unannounced to our son’s football games twice where he had to ask them to leave, they threatened to sell his house, giving him a 30 day eviction notice and they went through his house (who knows how many times) unannounced while he wasn’t home. Before I moved in I had him change the locks and install a ring camera. Last week I got notification someone is at the door but didn’t ring the bell. I checked it. His mom parked down the street, wearing a hat and sunglasses comes up to the door with her key in hand, notices the camera then turns right back around and left. Caught. That pissed my partner off. His counselor says they treat him like a child. This is the 2nd counselor who mentioned enmeshment. The 1st mentioned “narcissistic traits” when describing his parents. He wants us to move out of state as soon as the kids get out of school this summer. He knows we can’t have them in our lives without them interfering in our relationship. He doesn’t want to risk it again. They have a problem with control and now that they don’t have it they’re going crazy. I was nice for 18 years. I was spineless. I allowed them all the access they wanted when they wanted. I knew they talked badly about me to their friends and family. I was so stupid back then for hoping they liked me even though my gut told me otherwise. The divorce gave me all the proof I needed. This time around I’m done with them.
