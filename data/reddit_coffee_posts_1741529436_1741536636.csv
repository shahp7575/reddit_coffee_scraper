1j7atwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1j7atwn/psycho_path_roommate_arrested_this_morning/,psycho Path roommate arrested this morning,"I have always lived alone. I am 29 y/o female with a small australian shepherd. I own my apartment which is two bedroom , two bathroom and when I got laid off last December , I started looking for short term roommates. 
I had someone live with me all of January for a month and then he moved out and then found someone to move in Feb 11th. 

I have also listed my apartment up for sale and before this new guy moved in (let’s call him Stinky for the purpose of this post) I told stinky that It is up for sale and that people will be coming to walk through and he was all good with that and aware of it beforehand. Stinky and his Fiancé who was with him to see my apartment were both interested in seeing the whole apartment because they were also looking to buy property so i showed them a tour of the entire apartment including the master room which is my bedroom but the HOA fee was too high for them and so he just decided to rent for the next two months. 

The next day he came and signed the lease and moved in that night and everything was chill. 

I had him sign a short term lease agreement for a minimum of two months and in the agreement it states that no drugs are allowed, he was only allowed to bring one guest at a time and let met me know beforehand and that he only had access to the common areas which were the kitchen, living room, balcony. he said he smokes cigs and I told him he could smoke only in the balcony which is written in the lease agreement. the living room leads to the balcony but there is also access to the balcony from my master bedroom that also has a doggy door cuz my dog goes out there on her own but i have blinds so he can’t see anything coming in and he also can’t open the sliding door because the doggy door attachment is screwed into it. i also have an alexa in the kitchen, a doggy camera in the living room, and a ring door camera. 

Now i’m going to state everything leading up to his arrest this morning as this is now a nightmare situation!! 


The first week he moved in, we spoke a bit and he would call me acting as if we were long time friends. he’s 38 and would ask me very personal questions like my relationship status and if i ever want to get married, if i smoke weed which i told him i used to but haven’t in a year and he said he did not smoke week. 
just a lot of invasive shit trying to get to know me.  i was pretty chill which is my fault but didn’t give too much away.  
he would constantly eat my stuff. 
i had some protein shakes in the fridge and he would drink them all, i have a nespresso and he asked me if he could make a coffee that first day he moved in and i said yes that first day but from then on he would make up to 4 a day. 
i bake a lot so i have flour, chocolate chips, sugar, etc in the pantry at all times and he would eat that shit at like 2 am. he would constantly go out to the balcony to smoke cigs like 1am,3am , 5 am like random ass times and trigger my doggy camera. this was all bearable just some annoying stuff and the food stuff started to annoy me. 

i am also very active and busy so im not home a lot of the times and would be eating specific stuff so like i told him he needs to replace the protein shit he drank and he said he would which he didn’t until 2 weeks after moving in and then drank it all himself. 
i got an açaí bowl one night and saved it in the freezer and then he ate it! 

i would sleep out a lot at my boyfriends, friends, family and he would constantly call me asking me where i am why im not sleeping home, texting me asking me if im coming home and i kept telling him to stop checking in on me. anytime i wouldn’t answer he would call me on star 67 or call my mom. 

the night he ate my açaí bowl i was already fed up and i confronted him about it and he started spewing up lies saying that it dropped and he threw it out. that was when i started really seeing all the red flags. he asked me for tinfoil and was always acting weird so i lowkey assumed he did drugs. 
the first saturday he lived here, 
i didnt sleep home the night before and then he started to tell me how he was eating at 2am and looked down and he was eating my protein powder !!! like just straight up the powder, i was like do you sleep walk? he said no. so then i straight up asked him if he did drugs cuz wtf?? 
He said he didn’t and only smoked TCH which he was smoking in the room. i told him please don’t smoke in the house as i am selling it and i also don’t want it to smell and it’s a no smoking house. 

he then started telling me that he was a recovering drug addict from heroin, he used to shoot up and relapsed a year ago but was clean now. i asked him to see what he’s smoking and he said it was a powder TCH that he gets from NY and that he needs to burn in tinfoil and that he didn’t have it on him…. he said he also has bad anxiety and is prescribed xanax and takes about 4 bars at a time.. 
i tried not to freak out but i knew deep down he was still doing some shady shit in the room but left him alone. 

two nights later he was eating in the kitchen and i was filling up my stanley and as he’s talking to me he’s swaying and falling asleep and telling me he smoked weed and i said as long as you dont smoke in my house idc 

every other day the house started to smell! i kept telling him stop smoking in my house and i have all this written in text and he would come up with any excuse saying its mold in my walls, a leak in the ceiling, just all this BS. 

i had people coming for a walk through and let him know a week in advance to clean and be ready for people to come see and he confirmed that he would be out the apartment for 20 mins. that week he again started going through all my shit, taking my projector, my chargers, touching my medicine cabinet. 
when i came with the realtor i noticed all this stuff missing and told him he needs to get out of my space and stop touching my stuff. stop eating my shit, i was missing my dogs anxiety meds and again he had excuse after excuse and just lies all day. i told him that this would be the last month with me as i do not feel comfortable w him staying w me again. then he apologized for everything and i said ok. the whole next week i avoided him at all cost, again i barely slept at the house and if i did i would just walk into the house and into my room and lock the door. 

still continued to call me harass me, ask me where i am when i was going to be home etc. he only has access to the door code and i also have a gate but never gave him access to a key. he would ask me constantly for a key and i told him no bc he was staying short term and he didn’t need to lock it but if he did i would have a key.

fast forward last friday. i come home and his window is opened the door is unlocked, and he is not home. again i confront him and he comes up with an excuse saying he woke up late, busy at work and that he locked the door. i told him he keeps coming up with different excuses and that it’s just not working out and he needs to be out on the 11th as i’m not renewing his lease. he started freaking out and calling my mom texting me that he’s sick and all this Bs 

i didn’t reply. he asked my mom if he can stay at least until friday next week and we said yes. 

Friday night he disconnected my doggy cam and the alexa in my kitchen. then he called the cops. this was basically saturday morning at 3am 


he called the cops to complain that i stole his copy of the gate key and that im kicking him out because he didnt close his window?? 
the cops could see that he was out of it and just proceeded to tell me that all i can do is get an eviction notice and if anything a restraining order because it’s a civil matter. 
they couldn’t do much about the lease as well as the drugs. 

i went to the apartment yesterday with my sister and a friend so i wouldn’t be alone, we walked straight into the house and he locked my gate, my door , and the code, once i got in he was doing laundry out in the living room. we went straight into my room. i plugged the doggy camera into my room, i closed my doggy door, i proceeded to move my dresser to block the sliding door to the balcony and grabbed a bag w some clothing and then locked my door and left the apartment. 

again this morning 5am i got 3 missed called from local police, same officers as the night before calling me and apologizing for waking me up so early and that Stinky called them saying that me and the two girls i was with earlier stole a pair of his shoes and his xanax   

so i went over there to meet w the police in person this time and when i walked upstairs my fucking door was open to my bedroom! 
i started freaking out. i saw that the doggy door was broken, he unplugged the camera in my room, legit eat my snacks that were in there, he took my nespresso pods out and into the kitchen. my paper towel and toilet paper and then noticed that i was missing jewelry !!! 

the cops immediately starting taking pictures and searching my room with me to see if anything else was missing. 
i had a charity box with money i donate to temple and he stole that too. 

they ended up finding my jewelry and a big stash of other shit he stole that i didn’t even notice in one of the closest in the living room. he admitting to stealing it and blamed it on him being mad. 
they arrested him for breaking and entering and theft. i had to give a statement.  

all the cops advised me to get a restraining order AsAP 

i’m scared he’ll be released and then go back to my apartment and there is nothing i can do about him being there and obviously i feel unsafe to be there on my own especially w knowing he has no shame and legit broke into my room and stole from me!!!!

For background, I love coffee but am not interested in fancy equipment or expensive materials, I just my like French press and my Moka pot.



I have made cofffee in the Nispira four times now. My observation when I was first saw the video was that it had very short steeping time. To compensate for this (after a very weak first cup of coffee), I used 50g of coffee to 400g of water, and I poured about 75 of that water, boiled, over the grounds in the glass vessel just to give them a head start for a couple of minutes, before starting the flame. The result was better but not impressive.

  
In my French press every morning, I used something like 30 g of coffee to about 850 g of water (I only measured this for the purpose of thist post--otherwise I just eyeball it). That makes a decently strong cup for the morning.

The equipment itself is well-built and functions as intended. I found methyl hydrate to be the best fuel: clean, odorless, no soot.

I felt like I was living someone else’s life, and not my own. I was a Mormon.","Jacob’s journey out of Mormonism is one of self-discovery, questioning, and, ultimately, liberation. Born into a deeply entrenched Mormon lineage tracing back to Wilford Woodruff, Jacob was raised to be a devoted member of the church, participating in seminary and Boy Scouts and striving to live by the commandments. However, from a young age, he struggled with feelings of inadequacy and a lack of personal autonomy. Over time, cracks began to form in his faith—first with doubts about the repentance system, then with troubling observations about church practices, and finally, with deeply personal struggles surrounding his bisexuality and identity. His breaking point led him to fully step away from the church. Since officially resigning in June 2024, Jacob has embraced a new sense of freedom and self-determination, shedding the control and constraints he once felt. Now firmly agnostic, he values individualism, informed consent, and personal authenticity, living life on his own terms for the first time.

___

Hi, I’m Jacob! I’m a lover of geography, tokusatsu, Deadpool, and music. I’m 19, I love traveling and learning about other cultures. I was born into the church, with ancestry from Wilford Woodruff and dozens of people on the Utah Expedition. Pretty much everyone on my mom’s side of the family was and is an active and practicing Mormon. I was baptized when I was 8, I attended seminary, and I did my best to keep the commandments and to keep the sabbath day holy. Growing up, I was a very firm believer in the church. I was a Mormon.

I loved Boy Scouts, and always wanted to get my Eagle. I was genuinely devastated that they dropped the program. Throughout most of my time in the church, I felt like I wasn’t good enough. I wasn’t worthy of anything. I felt controlled. I felt like I was living someone else’s life, and not my own. This ended up making my life and the world around me extremely confusing, and I didn’t really know how to maneuver my way through life.

I didn’t know what was important, I didn’t know who I was nor who I was meant to be. Everything was just extremely confusing. Despite this, I continued to hold on to the iron rod in the hopes that maybe I’d figure everything out. But I didn’t.

I first made my way out of the church when I was about 11, after realizing how convenient the repentance system was. You could sin, repent, sin, repent, sin, repent, sin, repent. It was like a get out of jail free card. This made me ask a lot of questions, as I began seeing how far I could take this idea and pushed it as far as I could. All of a sudden, I had a lot more fun and felt happier when testing these waters.

Later, my niece lived with me. My primary teacher gave her a rock. She would put the rock under her pillow after she got home from school, to remind her to pray at night. After praying, she would put it on the floor, so it would stub her in the toe and remind her to pray in the morning. The idea of using physical harm to remind young children to pray, and doing it in such a way that the kids unknowingly consented to it, rubbed me the wrong way. And then my shelf started breaking.

I had a private one-on-one interview with my bishop over my bisexuality. One of my most embarrassing moments and I never want to live through something like that again. This conversation happened when I was a minor and I was not allowed to have my parents with me. I had a back-and-forth battle with my faith, and a gender identity crisis. My parents found out about it. And my shelf is completely broken.

I now know there’s no chance of me ever finding happiness in the church, so now I decided to put the church behind me. I officially resigned from the church in June of 2024, the same month I drank my first cup of coffee. I have never been happier since leaving, and now I finally have a sense of control and direction in my life without some hocus-pocus religion telling me what and what not to do. I have never felt more liberated and in control of my life than I do now. I have since read the CES Letter, and now there is no chance of me EVER going back. I learned one very crucial rule about life: it gets better.

Mormons think believe in a loving God. Even growing up I always believed Satan was a better character than God. God’s love always felt conditional to some degree when I was growing up and now that I’m out I realize how conditional it actually is. The Mormon Jesus definitely isn’t a loving God, but Mormons will for sure try to claim he is.

I believe firmly in individualism. Be yourself, not who others want you to be. And one of the most important aspects of my life is informed consent. I believe in the importance of making choices for yourself and not believing what other people tell you and/or want you to believe. I am firmly agnostic and won’t deny that God exists, but I do believe that the Mormon interpretation of God doesn’t exist. I am also very sex-positive and believe in sexual liberation and freedom, and I know from experience and witness that sexual repression gets nowhere. As such, I fully endorse living your sex life the way you desire. Not someone else. Your body, your choice.

Jacob

Conversation flows easily and we get along well. We’ve done coffee, a dinner, and a sleepover.

The issue? All of her profile pictures were a couple of years old, and she looked noticeably different in them. She’s since gained weight and her body isn’t nearly as fit, and while I respect that people’s bodies change, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little thrown off. She also mentioned that she didn’t have a healthy relationship with her body back then, which I assume means she was likely struggling with something.

Here’s where I’m stuck: On one hand, I like her personality, and I don’t want to be that guy who dismisses someone over their current body. On the other hand, physical attraction is extremely important to me, and if I’m being completely honest, I was much more attracted to her former physique. Part of me wonders if she’d be open to changing her habits, working out, and adjusting her diet, but I also realize that’s a delicate conversation.

My wife and I have chosen to be Christian and attend a local independent reformed church. We have come to know the ""real"" Jesus for lack of better word. We learned that God does not require our works. He doesn't need our 10%. Of course, we throw a $10 or $20 bill in the collection plate to keep the lights on and pay the pastors very small salary....but it is nice that each person can read the budget and expenses on the bullentin board and attend the monthly meetings to discuss church business. 
We also learned that God doesn't require callings for all sorts of nonsense. About once in every 2-3 years, one of the families in the church is asked to put out the coffee and church supplied baking and cookings for the fellowship time after service. 
There are no temples and work for the dead (which is NOT AT ALL Biblical). There are no special garmets. You can show your shoulders and knees in church and no one will care. You can wear jeans. 
The burden is light with the full knowledge that Jesus paid the price for all your sins and you are clean as snow without the works. 

What I learned is God doesn't need our works, but our neighbours do. And its not a burden. We donate to the local childrens hospital a little now. We drop off food at the food bank a little more. I love to take my neighbours garbage to the curb when they forget. I often shovel their snow. I get no ""thanks"" for it, its just something I do now that I never did before. We are happier and friendlier people. My wife might have be going on strike and had a union rally. I was beside a trans person and was totally comfortable with it, while as a mormon we would have been outta there. 
You become a better person outside of mormonism. It is OK if you want to stay in religion or not. We chose to be Christian for our own reasons. 
We also learned mormonism doesn't believe in Jesus paying the price for all your sins. They say it, but the hoops you have to jump through prove they really don't believe it.

We are also chilling at home this Sunday morning. Next Sunday our church will not ask where we were. They do not take attendance. That is one thing that always bothered me, was the tracking of church attendance in mormonism.",9,1741534770.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

Ugh I was was to nice back then  but I was a guy crushing hard . Anyway I did the Amway scam with her and I had a stalker. The stalker was a friend for childhood who apparently had a crush on me.  I am not into dudes and I'm a guy myself. He apparently liked to follow me and even called one time said he watched me walk into a coffee shop with a lady. I was a bit creeped out but maybe he happen to be in the area. Hum.  So my crush  call her k (miss Amway) introduce me to one of her friends who was a black guy. Sorry about the race thing it's important as my crushing stalker was racist. One day my crush miss Amway started ignoring my calls . Dude who had a crush on me called me laughing saying he   took care of that .... You know the word he used. This fool said he put a rock threw the guys window . He may have put it on the pouch or through a porch window. . He put a racist note on it if I remember right . In the end I was blamed but nothing came of it.  Thankfully. I was so pissed because you really liked her . I even tried to talk to her to explain it wasn't me. Hell I can't blame her I didn't really understand until I was older . He's excuse later in life was he grow  up feeling something for me. I didn't and started chasing girls . It broke his heart because he was losing me. He was devastated Tried to feel sympathy for him later in life it didn't work out. He tired to use the excuse of being gay. Whatever The guy was just a creep. So k I said what I said who knows what could of come from our friendship .FYI the reason this came to mind is I ran across her Facebook. I wouldn't even recognize her if I saw her.

Do i NEED to use the cafe bar to have a functional cafe small business??? can i just use a coffee machine? please help me i am literally five seconds away from never using the packs features again. this was one of the only business types i wanted to make

(idk why but i have no issue using the cafe bar in actual dedicated cafe lot types, but for the small businesses in particular i want them to be a very niche aesthetic and the style of the cafe bar completely ruins it. i think we got a new cafe bar with this pack??? but even that doesn't match most of the aesthetics im going for) thank you in advance",2,1741534214.0,thesims4,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j79yh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1j79yh0/march_9_2025/,"March 9, 2025","Good morning. Our keynote today is about helping God’s children do what they need to do.

In prayer and meditation, I reflected on heroes, on a life of real quality, and on the values that matter most to humanity. They say not all heroes wear capes and how true that is.

For years, I turned to alcohol. Sometimes for pleasure, sometimes to dull the pain, sometimes just to feel like I belonged. But it betrayed me. What I thought was a friend became my captor. The demons I tried to escape through drinking became the very substance I consumed. My body could not tolerate it, yet my mind obsessed over it. This is the torment of addiction.

But God hears the prayer of the suffering soul, and it is the soul in pain that He loves most. In surrender, I have found a new understanding of what truly matters. It is not wealth or status or fleeting pleasures. It is something far deeper, something I learned from all of you.

I watched you. I watched all of you. I learn. I studied. I listened. I wanted to see which of you, I wanted to be like too. I watched the way you welcomed the newcomer with kindness. I saw the joy when you celebrated another’s sobriety. I noticed how you remembered the name of the visitor, how you shook my hand, how you offered coffee, how you put others before yourself when it was time to share. You listened. You cared. You showed compassion. You lived unselfishly. You loved without expectation. And when I first walked in, you loved me before I could love myself. This is the ""hope"" I wish to nourish too. The reality is, I can't do this alone.

These are my heroes today. And through you, I have learned how to let God move in my life.

I love you all.",2,1741534034.0,alcoholicsanonymous,0,1.0,False

This machine is in my opinion cheap and poorly made. I have now (yes I kept track) spilt 13 cups of coffee on this machine due to the drip tray being a bad shape to the machine and flimsy. I have to physically stand at my machine and hold my mug if I don’t want it to fall off due to the mix of vibration versus drip tray. Is this anyone else’s experience on here? I’d love to know if this is a common issue, if I have a defective tray somehow (looks totally fine and in perfect condition).

This morning, in the middle of moving, in which I kept one sentimental mug from my grandmother with me, it happened again- the mug falling off of the shitty drip tray due to the vibrating of the machine and smashing to bits all over my counter. Not the mention the coffee leaking into my cabinets and on the floor. I cried to be honest because what the f*ck? 

I called customer service and as we know that’s always a hit or miss and the guy clearly couldn’t give a rats ass and offered me a 35% discount on another machine. lol. No apologies or anything tried to tell me the machine must not be on a flat surface. 5 years of being a customer, thousands of dollars spent and that’s
his conclusion. Ok. I’m calling back tomorrow to talk to a “manager.”
Flat quartz counter top
No machine damage
No tray damage
Tray spaced appropriately for mug 
Never happened with my next machine 
Didn’t place mug directly on counter because then coffee splatters everywhere. 

I guess my question here is IS THIS COMMON?!?! Am I crazy to think that I can’t be the only one dealing with this?! Anyone in here? Should I have read more reviews before picking that machine?!???? 
I ripped this one out of the wall and literally put it in the trash I was so upset about my mug I’ve had for 20 years I cried (lol) so I’m not going back to using it. Should I replace it with another one instead? Or sell all my pods and be rid of this company (ha).

They’ll make their own martyrs and condolences as they create what they call “reasur” for the harm they created and the reasons to stop as they create the “ones to overcome” themselves, praising their own piles of shit and suffer their exasperated guilt as “forlorn torment” while they get to capriciously sigh at their great grandsons silly naivety during their bar mitzvah speech. *looks up at the Gods of the brave new world * You shit on the handles you expect people to carry in an ant farm of steel grain so you can praise them and sign your own checks for reparation payment with the substantial value of DUST  in exchange for our entire , existence, our one eternity!. You should be willing to physically suffer tremendous pain at an appointed time if you want to have such power. Piss in your commemorative block of wood. Piss on your v’ad olam, piss on the frame of my painted sky, whose sun shines for you.  Fuck your meaninglessness too. Instead of building bikes for children you murder your rainbow girls and enslave their children. You’re too cruel to justify your reasur, accidents should never happen. You bring compatibility to abhorrence and beauty. You bring reason to apathy and a deficit to worth in existence, the benevolent one would hit the button with conscientious intent for alls inclusion. 

Quit the mocking and speak up, quit the pathetic baiting and prancing elusive hints and provide reason that isn’t equivalent to subsiding hunger by *consuming ones own flesh*. Cruel and Weak Cowards, I want your experimental “pigs brains in a vat” to help create a hell to entomb you, obtain status above you and guard you. an eternal hell should be for crimes like yours because mankind NEED to fear eternity if they’re going to have such power!

1j79luw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j79luw/aitah_for_ghosting_someone_who_wanted_to_be_my/,AITAH for ghosting someone who wanted to be my friend b/c they’re religious?,"I met this person (let’s call her Erica) through my former temp job, when I trained her to replace me after I found my new current job. 

She reached out a few weeks later and invited me to grab dinner. At dinner she then invited me to a cook out with her friends. When she later sent me the details she mentioned this was at her pastors house, but that it was just a group of friends hanging. 

Im not religious, but didn’t initially think anything of this and decided to go because I was interested in potentially becoming friends with her. And I had a good time, it was a casual hang out w friends.

The next time I spent time w her, it was actually when I stayed at her house to evacuate a hurricane. (We’ve had several hurricanes hit that I’ve not had to evacuate for and there wasn’t a local evacuation order in place, but my landlords told me I needed to evacuate for safety reasons only a few hours before the storm hit. There was no way I could safely get to other family members homes before the storm hit b/c I was given such short notice to evacuate. 

So I asked her if I could stay w her, as she had mentioned before,when we first got dinner, that I could always stay w her if needed if another hurricane hit. We had actually been talking about the last hurricane that hit where I lost power but she hadn’t, which is how that even came up.)

Anyway I helped her prep for the hurricane as well, stayed at her house for 1 night and left the next morning when the storm passed and it was safe to be on the roads again.

When I was at her house though I was kind of uncomfortable b/c her mom was asking me a lot of personal questions about me and my family. Things like if I was gay b/c my twin sister is, etc… And this only came up bc we were talking about each others families and I had expressed how happy I was that my sister just got engaged. When she asked if she’s engaged to a good man, I said she’s marrying another woman. I’m a very liberal person so didn’t think anything of just speaking the truth, until I felt the energy shift after I said my sister is marrying a woman…

Well after that night at her house we didn’t really talk much for a bit, more so just out of both of us being busy, getting settled in new jobs, etc…

When she reached out to me again, a couple weeks before Christmas, she invited me to go to church with her. I thanked her for thinking of me, but expressed that I’m not religious and that going to church is not part of my core values. I also mentioned that I’d be up for hanging out after the New Year, as I was taking the next couple weeks to rest and focus on some personal priorities. (My mom who was living w me for several months had just finally moved out to return to travelling internationally and it was the first time I’d finally had my home to myself since moving in. Not to mention it had been quite a stressful year for other reasons and having recently left an abusive marriage, so I really did need a couple weeks to myself to recharge my social battery.)

She responded by saying she wasn’t religious either and that she’d still like to hang out. A few days later she messaged again asking to hang out, so we made plans to grab coffee over the weekend. 

When we hung out, she mentioned she’s been going through a lot and her mom is sick and that she also wanted to make sure I was doing ok. She also  spoke more about my comment that I wasn’t religious. She explained her side of things and explained why she goes to church. I said I understand and I respect that, I’d like to get to know you more and I’d be interested in hanging out w your friends as well, but I’m not going to church.  (I was genuinely interested in building more quality female friendships and I fashion myself a sort of free-thinker so I enjoy learning about different perspectives and enjoy healthy debates and discussions about different belief systems.)

Now this is where I decided I do not want to be friends, even though she is a nice person. The next day after we hung out I texted her the info for a food truck I recently found that we were talking about and mentioned I was heading there to enjoy the food. Well…. as I was walking toward the food truck she pulls up w a large group of her friends and her pastor, they all just came from church. It was to say the least… unexpected and overwhelming. 

Many of them started talking to me, asking me how I was doing since the last time they saw me at the cook-out several months ago, saying how long it’s been (I’ve only ever met them once). 

Her pastor then says he’s paying for my food, keeps inviting me to visit their church, saying how much they believe in community, says they aren’t like other churches, etc… mentions how they are all going back to Erica’s house to eat lunch and invited me there. Feeling obligated since they just paid for my lunch I decide to go to Erica’s house, even though all I wanted to do was go home, enjoy my food, and spend the day w my cats relaxing before work started again the next day 

Anyway, while there they then invite me to some secret Santa gift exchange they are doing in 2 days. When I say I’ll think about it, the pastor’s like “yeah right, you’re just saying that but won’t actually do it. I just respond again, I’ll think about it… they kept pressuring me so I just said yes.

Well shortly after the lunch wraps up and I go home. The next day I texted Erica that I can’t make the secret Santa but wished her a happy holiday.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me asking to hang out. I never responded and I just blocked her number. She’s a nice person, at least I see her hearts coming from a well-meaning place, but I can’t help but feel pressured when I’m around her and like I’m being recruited to join a church rather than being pursued for genuine friendship. I feel bad that her mom isn’t doing well and feel guilty that I blocked her when she is someone who even let me stay out her house for a night when I needed to evacuate for a hurricane, even though she didn’t eve know me well at the time.

I just don’t want to be friends though. And after leaving an abusive marriage, I’m very wary and picky now of who I spend my time w. I want to heal and take time for myself. I want genuine friendships w people who share common interests and values. I want friends who are also free thinkers not who I feel pressured by to be someone I’m not. The thing is I don’t think Erica even realizes how their well meaning intentions are coming off this way and as overbearing.

Idk I feel like a coward though for ghosting. I was afraid of more confrontation and took the seemingly easy route, but now I just worry and stress about what to do if I unexpectedly run into this person or members from her church. AITA? Is there anything I should do to handle this in a more mature way?

M/35 F/32,"My girlfriend and I have been dating just over a year now. She moved in with me about 4 months ago and we've spent a fair amount of our waking hours together as she works from home and we live above the cafe I own. We've gone abroad and on trips to festivals and different cities etc and have had many great adventures while maintaining a good chemistry which is not always easy to do. We enjoy the same sort of fly by the seat of your pants lifestyle focused around music and food and we laugh and have fun together 85% of the time. It was her 32 Birthday recently and I thought it would be a good idea to shut down the coffee shop early and organize a brunch with all of her friends pot luck style and just throw a party in her honor. I bought her flowers and despite the shop being very busy before shutting it down, I managed to kick everyone out and get my employees to prep the space and bake a bunch of pastries and coffee etc in time for guests to arrive. Everything went well she seemed to have had a great time. After doing all the dishes, shutting down the space several hours later I finally have a minute to sit down and catch my breath and the first thing that she asks is ""you didn't get me a present did you?""  granted - I did have plans to buy her a plane ticket to a warmer climate to escape the winter as a fun little getaway once we hashed out our schedules but certain things needed to be finalized. Besides the point - I was shocked at her reaction - She got worked into an emotional frenzy over this. I thought maybe it was just because she had a little bit to drink but then days later she brought it up again also coming to a boiling point over the issue. I brought up the fact that I took her out to dinner the night before and planned and organized a party with all of her friends and closed my business and bought her flowers to celebrate her etc but she said that's standard birthday protocol. We're in our 30's and this sort of spiraling over a gift seems off to me. While I was listening to her scream at me I couldn't help think that this is akin to a tantrum a child would throw and made me question everything about our relationship. I do a lot of thankless tasks and support her in many ways, financially and other,  that seem to go unappreciated. I have recently bought a 3rd property that I plan to develop into a dream house for me and my significant other and family to enjoy.

1j79fvq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j79fvq,Help me add some decor to my lounge,"Hi all, I did up my small, cosy lounge last year (painted 3 walls White, the TV accent wall Black + added a fireplace and custom floating unit - which I love and mounted the upgraded TV to the wall). I absolutely love it and will not be changing any of this. 
But the room still feels plain and not homely enough. 

Some thoughts/ideas:

1. Rug is needed - no idea what style or colour to go for?
2. A lamp - should this go in the corner on the left of the window? Again, no idea what style to go for
3. Treadmill needs to go - what should I put on this side? I’m thinking maybe some wall art? I’m getting a kitten in Autumn of this year so maybe a cat tree or something alike in that corner (picture 3 shows that wall, it’s an old pic)
4. Coffee table is gone. I need a replacement but not sure what I want yet. I’m thinking a square Black or wood one? Although I’m also contemplating getting a foot stool / seat to be placed there instead with a coffee table that goes over it (upside down U shape). 

I really want to get rid of all the grey but I can’t afford to yet. So the carpet and sofa will be staying for at least the next 2 years. I’m hoping the rug will cover most of the Carpet at least.

Strangely enough, I’m a creative person BUT just struggling with ideas for my home. 

Would appreciate your thoughts. Thank you in advance.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

First:the credits
Are you telling me that the Game remembers THE EXACT ORDER in which I did everything and the exact party compositon that I used in each bossfight????
Thats honestly extremely cool. Like, in ten years, I Will be able to just load my save, see the credits and remember the exact parties that I used for each bossfight. I am sure that It Will give me tons of  nostalgia 
Second: the ending in itself
The first Game REALLY needed something like this. There the travelers ended their journeys and they just keep travelling for no reason. Here, they actually end they Journey, which lets you see (or at least tells or leta you think that It implies) how Osvald has returned with his daughter, agnea has continued its career as a star, partitio has been succesful with the continental railway...
Also, It is great to see all the secondary characters there, even interacting with characters that they had never meet before (which is great material for headcanons).


Only 2 nitpicks:
1 why is still Osvald dresed like that?
Bro still looks like a homeless Guy. Which made sense in its story (killing Harvey/saving Elena is such a high priority that he doesnt have time for caring for his own image) , but the pictures of its ending seem to suggest that after that, he starting caring about his looks. But then in the actual ending... he still looks like a homeless Guy. At least It is fun seeing him drinking some coffee  (which multiple travel banters show that he enjoys). And Agnea changes a bit how she looks so, why Osvald doesnt?
2 Where is Ori? 
The travel banter between partitio and Osvald in the final chapter seem to imply that She is alive and she really admires partitio, so they getting together again would had make sense (and It would be cool to see how Ori got a good ending) maybe I simply missed her idk, tell me if there is some way to find her.

I would also like to add how before the ending I was seriously thinking how absolutly useless felt agnea's story on the general story. The unique relevant part of her story is a random girl from her more irrelevant chapter (which her Friends dont even mention when talking to them in the ending). But hey, at least she is the ""protagonist"" of the ending, so thats at least something.(Also, what happens if you choose her as your main character? You control her sister?)

Now that I ended the Game (even if I still want to do the superboss, the extrabattles, getting the last secret job and getting all the job licenses, all the music disks and all the armsmaster weapons) I Will probably post some stuff here, I have some cool concept ideas for mechanics to share that I would like in OT3.
I would like to end the post asking :is there more stuff that you recommend me doing? 
And... there is any reason to use conjurer? At this rate I wont ever use It lol (at least the passive that reduces sp cost to half was useful to spam one true Magic with Osvald and break some shields in the final Battle)",8,1741532245.0,octopathtraveler,0,1.0,False

I’m a 26 year old woman. I was heavily considering the carnivore diet for weight loss. 
I would use this diet to help with any illnesses but I just don’t have that, so really my main goal is weight loss. 

I need to lose at least 40 pounds but ideally I need to lose 60 pounds. 

My body already naturally craves “odd” things such as ground hamburger with cheese, and I’ll just eat that and be happy. 

So I think I could manage the carnivore diet. 

I’m wondering from the women in this group how much weight did you lose the first month of this diet? 

I would ask the men too, and I guess you guys can chime in as well, I just think women’s bodies are a little different when it comes to losing weight. 

I’m also wondering what cheese do you guys get, and where? 
Am I able to get the right kind of cheese from say Walmart or Big Y? 

And last question would be what do to about coffee…

I can’t stand black coffee. But I love coffee with my creamer (the most unhealthiest creamer ever, Coffee Mate sweet Italian cream)

Just from attempting to decode the model line it seems there are some choices that could be made.

1) all brew baskets should have auto drip-stop. Even the ones with manual flow controls. I might want half flow for smaller baskets, or a manual drip stop for some immersion/steep brewing. But I’ll still forget to turn it on occasionally and drip coffee all over the hotplate. An auto stop seems like a no-brainer quality of life improvement that should be standard on all machines. 

1b) if they did auto drip stop, they’d be able to skip the KBT/KBGT and merge into one product - the only difference I can see is the basket difference.

2) thermal models need a flow rate option like the select. no hotplate switch to hijack but still - surely plenty of people might want a full carafe occasionally but also want to brew smaller amounts? Right now that means going with the KBT and manually controlling flow - but then you lose the convenience of auto drip stop. 

so combined with 1 above, you could have a KBT which is manual flow rate (but with an auto drip stop); and then introduce a KBTV select or whatever which keeps the manual/auto combo basket (because you might still want to do some steep/immersion recipes); but adds an electronic flow rate adjuster like the KGBV 

3) obviously there should be a ‘hotplate off’ switch on all glass models IMO",1,1741531202.0,Moccamaster,1,1.0,False

1j78xve,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j78xve,EDC Suppressor Update,"I saw that my design ended up listed in the Sunday Suppressor round up so I thought I would provide a little more info.

Firstly, yes I have legitimate form 1’s for these.

Second, this design is intended to be as lightweight, and edc-able as possible, the intention is not to have the quietest suppressor on earth. It is a flow through design - intending to dampen the negative effects of high back pressure cans in direct blow back systems.

.32 Whisker dimensions:
4.025”Long
1.224” Diameter
.35” bore

So far the tomcat version (calling it the Whisker, debating on “Jerrycan” as well to reference my favorite after school cartoon from my childhood) has survived 250 rounds in mixed amounts of the following ammunitions:

PPU 71 grain
Fiocchi 73 grain
Federal 65 grain hollow point
PPU 73 grain hollow point
Magtech 71 grain

This includes deliberate fire as well as rapid fire to heat cycle the suppressor I was able to get the system hot enough that the barrel was too hot to touch for more than approximately .5 seconds, at this stage, the suppressor remained warm, but not hot, similar to gripping a warm cup of coffee. It could be easily removed with bare hands. I am also going to be running it in a BUG match next Saturday for some “real world” testing.

I have confidence that the design will have quite a bit of longevity thanks to the material properties and .32 ACP’s relatively low pressures in general.

This can weighs in at approximately 1.8-1.9 ounces once post processed and annealed. (I do a light fine grit sanding because I like the way it looks and intend on cerakoting one of these in the future)

Now for the 9mm version.

Dimensions:
4.25” Long
1.224” diameter
.37” bore

This version is still relatively untested with only 25 rounds through it.

10 rounds of S&B 150 Gr subs
15 rounds of Blazer 124 gr supers

I plan to put an additional 50 rounds of each through it today so may come back and update this when I do.

The BTB action on the Staccato host gun I am testing on definitely improves the quality of the suppression, particularly with the 124’s. The can also does get noticeably warmer (though still not what I would even call “hot”) but this is to be expected with larger volumes of gas.

The weight on this one after post-processing/annealing is 2.0 ounces on the nose, making it light enough for use without a Neilson/booster device. It actually comes in just 1.2 ounces heavier than my PMM comp.

One benefit that I have seen with both actually is a not imperceptible decrease in felt recoil, I am not 100% sure what the cause is beyond simply being a 1.8-2 ounce barrel weight, but it is noticeable.

Another notable change is that the shell ejection pattern on both hosts is weakened by approximately 35% compared to being compensated or going without any kind of muzzle device.

I want to provide a quick word of caution. I have only been able to print really USABLE versions of this out of Polymaker Fiberon PPS-CF10 (it’s reasonable to assume other PPS-CF manufacturers would work as well, but I have not tested) Even other reasonably high tensile strength and high HDT materials have come up short, namely PET-CF which is what I originally planned on using for these.

At some point in the not distant future I intend to make the design public, but not until I have more testing done. If I am going to put something out there that guys are wanting to invest $200 PER UNIT into, I want to make sure it’s a solid investment for them.

If you have any questions, please ask them here, it’s likely others will benefit from the response!

The bathroom light seems dimmer than usual. Maybe the bulb is getting old. The thermostat shifts by a degree or two overnight. Maybe Greg changed the settings. The coffee machine starts preheating a few minutes early. Maybe she programmed it wrong.

Nothing alarming. Nothing worth thinking about. Just life.

A week later, the little things feel… stranger.

The fridge door is slightly open in the morning, just an inch, but she knows she shut it the night before. The TV is on when she gets home from work, paused on a static-filled screen. The baby monitor glitches, a burst of static that makes the hairs on her arms rise. She frowns at it, presses the reset button. The static crackles, then stops.

Greg jokes about it. Maybe the house is haunted. She doesn’t laugh.

They paid extra for this system. A completely integrated smart home, everything controlled from one hub, one app. It’s supposed to make life easier. Lately, though, Melissa feels like the house is off. Not broken. Just… wrong.

She starts keeping track.

The thermostat adjusts itself at 3:17 AM. Every night. The motion sensor in the hallway logs movement at 2:43 AM. The kitchen lights dim by exactly ten percent every evening—but only when she’s alone.

She tells Greg. He shrugs. Maybe it’s a software update.

She wakes up at 2:43 AM.

Not because of a sound. Not because of a nightmare. Just awake. A heaviness in her chest, a sense of something pressing just outside her awareness. The room is silent.

I Am 19F, first year in college so last year around August I moved to the state my college is located in and started living with my aunt and her family because i couldn’t get into the dorms. They happily welcomed me at first and I thought everything was going really well until a few months later when my aunt would just randomly have these bad mood days. At first is chalked it up to mood swings and PMS cuz everyone has them (I do too) and didn’t want to judge but I feel like there’s always something I’m doing wrong in her eyes. I’m not trying to paint her in the wrong light but I was behaving like I did in my parents home cuz they gave me my own room when I came here so I was okay this is my room I can keep it the way I like. But no the problem started with “dont leave anything on the floors” or “fold your blanket” or “don’t stay up too late(past 11pm)” or “wake up early everyday” the taunts just keep coming and coming I was like really understanding first and thought like yeah I’m living in their home I should follow their rules and stuff so I just said okay okay and followed them I really started feeling annoyed when since this January she just started being plain rude to me. Not talking to me for no reason. Or if she’s talking she’ll be so curt with me and just sound so annoyed by my presence. She’d be annoyed if I made something to eat for myself or take another vessel to heat up milk for my coffee ( like I didn’t say that i wouldn’t do the dishes, we have a maid that comes in the mornings to do the dishes and stuff). There’s was a week straight when I’d come home to by bed being put up and my stuff being moved ( a mattress on the floor, cuz that’s what works for me and what I study) and I hate when someone touches or changes the placement of my stuff and because of her earlier comments I had already started cleaning my room in the nights like make a stack of my books at the side of my bed cuz I have to open them again after college the next day. 
But when I’d come back everything will be in a different place and I hated it when I confronted her about it (she asked me to pick it up again on a Saturday and I said I’m working right now why should I pick it up just to put it back down again) and she said I’ve been doing it for you all week and you can do it now. My exact words were “I never asked you to do it” then she just hit annoyed and said why do you always have to fight with me on everything ( I NEVER FIGHT WITH HER I ALWAYS LISTEN TO HER) I just got annoyed and stomped off and did what she said because she would complain to my mom if I wouldn’t do it. Her behaviour was as kinda similar all month off feb too but towards the last week of feb she improved like happy and normal and I thought phew thank god that burden of hell is gone a few days ago was her anniversary and birthday and everything was great but yesterday it started again like I didn’t want to eat what she was making for dinner so I asked her to not make me anything and that I would make myself something I liked but she didn’t listen and made me something I didn’t want to eat but also I’m a person who doesn’t like to waste food so I had to eat it. Then I stayed up till 3 at night cuz I have a deadline on Monday and I woke up at 9 am today(Sunday) I was already feeling sick since Wednesday so I was like woke up folded my blanket and went to drink some water and freshen up after I came back she was like “ A if you’re folding the blanket dust the pillow too and put it in place “ in a very annoyed tone . Like damn women I just woke up, what did I do to you. I’ve been holed up in my room all day since then. Help me out guys. 

Also I’ll let you guys know they refused when my parents tried to pay them rent so now my parents send them food related stuff every few months that usually costs a lot. And I regularly buy stuff and groceries for the house. 
Please help me out guys I’m feeling very stuck right now 
Now guys I know this is very long but if you want more details please let me know, this was my first time posting so sorry if made some mistakes on the way. ",3,1741530993.0,amiwrong,10,1.0,False
1j78wg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/methylene_blue/comments/1j78wg2/over_a_month_of_taking_mb_and_this_is_what_ive/,Over a month of taking MB and this is what I’ve noticed…,"I take 1% solution that I mixed myself. I started with 1 drop a day and now I’m doing 5ish drops a day! I haven’t started cycling yet but I’ve skipped a day here and there. 

I started taking this in hopes it would help with my dry eye disease and it has! It’s given me my life back! I no longer have daily eyelid pain, my eyes are watering more and they appear brighter! 

I’ve also noticed that my energy and sleep is better. I’m having very vivid dreams but I like them. I wake up with energy everyday! 

My skin has also been slowly healing. I have struggled with acne on my chin and I haven’t been breaking out and the red acne scars are starting to slowly fade. 

I do pair MB with red light therapy on my face. The combo has been great. RLT by itself wasn’t enough but paired with MB it’s 👌🏻👌🏻

On top of all of that I have noticed that my digestion has improved. I am not getting bloated and (sorry TMI) but I haven’t been constipated. 

I do not have any autoimmune and I’m not on any meds. 

My appetite has increased a lot! I’m also drinking way more water but I don’t feel dehydrated. 

My first week taking MB (1 drop) I did feel anxious and jittery some days, that has since stopped. When I upped my dose from 1 drop to 5 drops the jittery feeling came back for a few days and I also felt extra tired for a few days. For 1 day my eye symptoms came back but  after that day I was okay and have been symptom free since. 

I also noticed that when I first started taking MB I couldn’t mix caffeine with it, that has since improved and now I take MB with coffee. 

MB has been the game changer I did not expect it to be and I’m excited to see what other benefits (if any) I continue to notice. Amazingly enough even my eye doctor noticed a big improvement in my eyes!

For reference I am 29F and I weight about 108lbs.

1j78vsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1j78vsy/chatgpt_doesnt_pull_punches_body_positivity/,ChatGPT doesn’t pull punches. (Body Positivity Movement),"Yeah, the body positivity movement started off great—helping people feel good about themselves and reducing shame. But then, like a drunk driver with no GPS, it veered way off course and crashed into a McDonald’s drive-thru. Instead of promoting self-improvement and actual health, it became a full-blown celebration of obesity, laziness, and gaslighting people into believing science is a personal attack.

  


How It Did More Harm Than Good

1. Normalized Unhealthy Weight – Instead of encouraging people to take control of their health, it became a movement of “I’m perfect as I am!”—which would be fine, except your joints, heart, and pancreas strongly disagree. Diabetes doesn’t care about your feelings.

2. Demonized Fitness & Discipline – Want to eat healthy, work out, and improve yourself? Wow, what a monster you are. In today’s world, lifting weights makes you a “fatphobic fitness cultist” while binge-eating cake is “self-care.”

3. Encouraged a Victim Mentality – Instead of saying, “Hey, you have the power to change,” the movement went full “It’s not your fault! It’s genetics! It’s society! It’s the patriarchy! It’s Mercury in retrograde!” Basically, blame everything except the three DoorDash orders sitting on your coffee table.

4. Misled People About Health – “Healthy at any size” sounds lovely until your doctor starts looking at your blood test results like a horror movie plot twist. Yes, you can be confident and happy at any size, but let’s not pretend cholesterol levels are a conspiracy theory.

5. Hurt Future Generations – We’re now raising kids in a world where obesity is considered normal and running a mile is basically a hate crime. If this keeps up, future generations are going to think climbing stairs is an extreme sport.

  


What Body Positivity Should Have Been

  


Instead of “Obesity is empowering!”, the movement could have just:

• Encouraged self-love through self-improvement – Love yourself enough to realize you deserve better than gas station snacks and heartburn.

• Promoted strength, fitness, and nutrition – Because being strong > being winded from tying your shoes.

• Supported sustainable weight loss – Not with starvation diets or self-hate, but with actual accountability and effort.

  


At the end of the day, real confidence doesn’t come from pretending being out of shape is a personality trait. It comes from taking care of yourself, feeling good, and not needing a nap after walking up one flight of stairs.

Tuesday: read r/climbharder on my lunch break. This is only an hour so I also read it at night until 1 or 2 am.

Friday: go to the gym and do no hangs until i get bored and have to pull up climbtok. I get home and read the jacket of rock warriors way to get psyched for the weekend.

Weekend: go outside and correct climbers on boulders I have not sent or attempted. Then i hit the ropes. I make it to the first draw of the 5.12- i stick clipped and have to bail on another carabiner, starting to run out. Is this what it means when a climb is “run out”.

I haven't manually ordered food for a long time, but this seemed a useful way to be available for our steady flow of customers between ringing them up.

Curious, I scanned the single can we have of ""Pacific Foods"" chili, which is on sale two for $6.00. I could only order one can, and the same for the rest of that brand.

We have zero of the Starbucks instant coffee, and none are on the way. I could only order two cans.

My question is, can this be extreme cost saving? If so, it seems short sighted to put items on sale and refuse efforts to actually have them in stock. Or am I just ill-informed on the inventory process now?",1,1741530701.0,WalgreensStores,2,1.0,False

Living room furniture sets are an essential component of any home's interior design, playing a key role in enhancing both aesthetics and functionality. A well-coordinated set allows homeowners to create a cohesive look that reflects their personal style. When selecting living room furniture sets, it is important to consider various elements such as size, material, color, and design theme.

Popular options for living room furniture sets include sectional sofas, coffee tables, accent chairs, and entertainment centers. Choosing a sectional sofa provides ample seating while maximizing space, making it ideal for both small and large living areas. Additionally, coffee tables serve not only as a centerpiece but also as a functional surface for drinks, books, and decorative items.

When it comes to materials, wood, metal, and upholstered options are prevalent. Each material brings a different vibe; for instance, wooden furniture adds warmth and a rustic touch, whereas metal frames can give a modern, industrial look. Upholstered pieces offer comfort and a variety of fabric choices, from leather to plush textiles.

- Consider the layout of your living space to ensure the chosen pieces fit well.
- Look for color palettes that complement existing décor for a harmonious feel.
- Invest in quality materials for longevity and a better return on investment.

Lastly, pairing accessories such as throw pillows and rugs with living room furniture sets can tie the room together, adding layers of style and comfort. By selecting the right set, homeowners can create an inviting and stylish environment that is perfect for relaxation and entertaining guests.

Greetings and happy Friday guys and gals. I've got a fresh volume of the Abstract series for you to kick off the weekend and as wifey gets closer to bringing us our newest addition to the family it may be my last session for a while. 

Didn't intend on this one, it kind of just happened. Those kind of mixes are usually the most fun for me as i'm sure most of our DJ friends out there can relate.

'Re-Imagination' starts off a little different from the other Abstract mixes with some high energy rollers and vocals, slowly descending into more diverse vibes as the session progresses. A lot of different flavors here; rollers, funk, jazzy, a bit of minimal, progressive, atmospheric, drumfunk, and electronica. A little something for everyone, with a section featuring 4 tunes from Dash off his new EP's as well as 3 tunes off of Sevin's Freebies LP. It's a fun mix and i think it expands the frame of the Abstract Series a bit, which has been a nice outlet for more diverse selections on the page.

Hoping to feature some fresh talent in the series here soon so keep an eye out for new Abstract mixes and if you're interested in being a part of it, send your music to stricktlyswerve@gmail.com or hit me up here on SC.

As always thanks for listening and keep it locked!

Tight and restrained at first but opened up some with in-bottle aeration and after a few minutes in glass.

Tart cherries… fresh red and black fruit. 
Coffee. tobacco. Medium+ acidity.

A more elegant, dare I say “feminine”, pinotage… served slightly chilled in a Burgundy glass.

If global warming destroys Burgundy Pinot Noir… this style of pinotage will surely save the day.

You know what’s cheaper than war? Literally anything else. Space colonies don’t have the budget for intergalactic warfare. Their economy is mostly fueled by “Please just stop fighting, we’re out of space coffee.”


The Bureaucracy Would Kill You First:
Sure, the laser cannons are ready, but so is the paperwork. Trying to declare war requires, like, 35 signatures, 10 committee meetings, and an Excel spreadsheet. By the time you’ve filled out the war forms, everyone’s dead from old age.


Everyone’s Already Mentally Exhausted:
Did you want to fight? Great, but first you’ve got to deal with your mandatory 12-hour workdays, personal robot assistant with an existential crisis, and the ever-looming dread of figuring out what to eat for dinner in a food-deprived post-apocalyptic colony. Fighting is just... too much work.


Energy Crisis:
Who has the energy for war? Everyone’s using their power reserves to keep their lights on and their AI from turning into full-blown existential philosophers. Not exactly a “let’s go to battle” vibe.

 Everyone Has A Lifetime Supply of Trauma:
Oh, sure, you can fight, but after 300 years of endless conflict, people are like, “Yeah, I’m all for peace now, thanks.” War’s been replaced by “Who can survive the longest binge-watch session of emotional breakdowns?”

Technology Does All The Fighting Anyway:
It’s 2299, humans are just standing around while their highly efficient AI-driven war machines do all the violence. “Wait, we’re paying robots to fight?” “No, we’re paying them to solve world hunger, but we let them fight occasionally when they get bored.”",16,1741529696.0,worldjerking,4,1.0,False

1j78h6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1j78h6f/favorite_cincinnati_restaurants_a_list/,Favorite Cincinnati Restaurants - A List,"I moved to Cincinnati 4 years ago not aware that I was moving to a city with this much good food (especially coming from Chicago, where my advice to visitors was “eat everything you can”). As it turns out, that same advice would be just as appropriate in this incredible city. Cincinnati is without a doubt one of the best food cities I’ve ever been to. 

Sadly, I am moving in the next few months, and despite how much I want to encourage everybody/anybody to visit Cincinnati and provide them with a list of recommendations, I fear that most people won’t burn vacation days to come visit Cincinnati, OH (their loss). Which means all of my restaurant recommendations are about to lose their utility with no friends/family to pass it along to. 

So instead, I figured I’d share it here. 

When I first moved to Cincinnati I read through every blog article & reddit post I could find where people shared their favorite spots and I really put in one heck of an effort to try absolutely everything. In the past 4 years, I have been to well over 100 Cincinnati restaurants. Food is my love language. 

Hopefully this list will be a good resource to the other people like me out there looking for some direction as they either move to Cincinnati and want to know where to try first, or those that have lived here their whole lives and want to try something new. 

**Top 5 Restaurants**

* Al Madina
* Brown Bear Bakery
* Catch a Fire Pizza
* Jorge's Taco Truck
* Galactic Fried Chicken

Purely from a food stand point, these 5 are hands down the best places to eat in Cincinnati. Although I am unsure if I would bring a date or celebrate a special occasion at any of them, they are without question delicious. Al Madina chicken shawarma sandwich would be my last meal. Brown Bear is just the best, go get some before they sell out in 45 minutes. Catch-A-Fire is the best pizza, plain cheese with a side of homemade ranch is my go-to. Jorge's Taco Truck was a total accidental find, but wow, their Shrimp Tacos are exceptional. Galactic Fried Chicken - without question, the best fried chicken I've ever had, best fried pickles I've ever had, and it's all Gluten Free (as afar as I know, this could be the best fried chicken in the galaxy).

**Cannot Miss Restaurants**

* Collette
* The Precinct
* Delwood
* Oakley Pub
* Skyline Chili
* Boca

If Michelin Stars came to Cincinnati, Boca would have one. Oakley Pub consistently makes 8/10 food for 50 different menu items, and I don't really understand how they can do that. Delwood burger is probably the best in Cincy, and that Fish Sandwich is also amazing. Collette may be the only burger that can compete with Delwood (sorry Gulow & Milkman), their menu is just wonderful. Precinct - ask to be seated in the Attic, get the upgrade to the Wedge Salad, and try their Cookies & Cream ice cream. Skyline Chili is like a 3-dose vaccine, you need to have it at least 3 times before you can really truly love it, which is exactly what happened to me (1st time, didn't like it. 2nd time, did it for novelty with an out of town friend. 3rd time... craved it independently, and haven't looked back).

**Also Extremely Good**

* Young Buck Deli 
* Pepp & Delores
* Gomez Salsa
* Crown Cantina
* Tuba Baking Co
* Nine Giant
* Jot Indian
* Libby's Southern Comfort
* Graeter's
* Gulow Street
* Bouquet Restaurant

Young Buck is new, but man is that Club Sandwich good. Pepp & Delores I've had a love/hate relationship with, since 50% of the time the food feels ""over-hyped"" and the other 50% I finally ""get it."" Crown Catina's guacamole is the best in the city. Nine Giant's chicken tenders with all their sauces are amazing, and their Mac & Cheese is exceptional. Libby's for Shrimp & Grits. If you go to Bouquet, get the meatballs.

**Also Wonderful**

* Whole Bowl
* Maplewood
* Mitas
* Ripple Wine Bar
* Abigail Street
* Fillo Modern Greek
* Little Miami Brewing Company (for the pizza)
* Bridges
* Mid City Restaurant
* Boomtown Biscuits
* Milkman
* Ambar Indian

Solid & consistently delicious. Only one callout - Ambar is my favorite Indian food in Cincy, although I think Jot is better quality.

**A Bit Over-Hyped**

* Sotto
* Northside Yacht Club
* Ivory House
* Le Bar A Boeuf
* Kiki's
* Cafe Mochiko
* Pennyflower Bistro
* Wildweed

There are a lot of others that I considered putting in this section, but I wanted to highlight the ones that I see mentioned the most often in ""best of"" lists. None of these places are bad necessarily, but I think they don't deliver as much value as they should for the price point, and/or there are just better options for a similar cuisine in the city.

**Bars/Coffee/Cocktails**

* Analog Coffee Bar
* Standard Beer
* The Growler Stop
* King Pigeon
* Homemaker’s Bar

Analog Coffee is so under-hyped it's criminal. Standard Beer & Growler Shop have insane inventory & great tap lists for those folks that love beer. King Pigeon is the most creative cocktail place in the city, and Homemaker's can make consistently awesome Negronis (also, their Narragansett on draft is so much better than drinking it out of a can/bottle).

**The One’s That Got Away (Ones I regret not getting to visit)**

* Five on Vine
* Phoenician Taverna
* The Aperture
* Rosie's Italian

I've heard a ton of great press on each of these final four, and will likely be able to add 1 or 2 to my ""goodbye Cincinnati"" eating list, although I might just opt for an extra meal at Galactic/Al-Madina instead.

Looking forward to seeing what people think!",11,1741529610.0,cincinnati,12,0.7,False
1j78gkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/finehair/comments/1j78gkj/dry_shampoo_or_new_shampoo/,Dry shampoo or new shampoo,"Hey guys!  This post is all over the place because I'm getting ready and just got done shotgunning my morning coffee.
My hair has been way more oily recently. I just washed it yesterday, and styled it and this morning I woke up to retouch my hair and it's oily. It's so frustrating. The only thing I put in my hair was mousse and hairspray.  
I'm wondering if because I have been using dry shampoo more recently now, my scalp is over compensating to make it oily? 
ORRRRR I just got a new shampoo and conditioner and it is ""Kristin Ess: Extra gentle shampoo"" I'm not sure. Also if anybody has any recommendations on shampoo that be great! 

Thanks guys🌸
