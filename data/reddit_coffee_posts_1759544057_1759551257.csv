1nxk6w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ilstu/comments/1nxk6w5/whats_meaning_of_human_life/,what's meaning of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759550940.0,ilstu,0,1.0,False

How to fix this as he doesn't want therapy?,"I am 30 and married someone who is 46. I used to work in the same company and he was the Managing director. We met face to face only once, while both waiting for our coffee at the company's coffee shop. He didn't know who I am, but I did. We all knew him. Especially for his temper and strong personality. He would get very frustrated under pressure and very tough with underperforming departments. I was with a coworker and we both said hello, but he didn't answer. He had a very tensioned relationship with my boss. She wasn't good at her job, missed deadline and lied a lot. So when he and her ended up in the same meeting (I participated in just one meet with both of them there) everyone else was quiet because they kept arguing. I was a bit jealous she could step up to him.

I left the company and we met again randomly. He had been divorced for one year at the time. He had no idea who I was, only when I told him the department, he asked: ah you were under (my boss name). I was a bit starstruck tbh. He was older, held power, was confident and could offer me something I lacked my whole life: a mascuIline figure just the way I dreamed about. He could lead, he could take decisions under pressure. I felt proud of him. My dad was not like that. I was ashamed of him. Jobless all the time, relied on my mother, his parents, always needed someone to take care of him and had a drinking problem. When I was a kid I was so ashamed and would lie to other kids that he does have a job but cannot say what it is.

So, within a year we got married. I am 30 now, have two children, a toddler son and a baby daughter and my husbands want more. My issue is that he has the same temper at home too as he has at job. While things are going smoothly, he is nice, fun, but as soon as they don't, he is irritated, frustrated, raises his voice. He climbed the corporate ladder and he is now the General Manager, so he couldn't even go higher than this. But spends even more time either at the office or at the production plants. He has his assistant but he doesn't fully trust her because he has to see with his own eyes that everything is going as it should.

He comes home, eats, showers and sleeps. We are intimate maybe 3 times a month if he is in the mood. But usually too tired for anything. When he is in a good mood he pulls me into his lap after I put our son to bed and then we spend 15-20 minutes talking and I rest my head on his shoulder or something. I love him but I am tired. I will also return to work in a few months. I work again at the same company as him, but at a low level position. So he didn't pull any strings for me. He said its better to work at the same place as I don't have a driving license and we can go and return home together. We go together, but usually a coworker drives me home because my husband returns at 7, 8 pm. Also, the coworkers I used to have a good relationship with, some years ago, now avoid me somehow",3,1759550633.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

It's been over a year since we broke up. A whole year. And I'm still so angry at her. I don't love her, I don't miss her, but this feeling of just being so pissed off and hurt... it sticks around.

It all started online, in some random group chat. God, I don't even remember how I got there. Probably some link from a friend. Anyway, we started talking in DMs. For like, a year? Maybe two? It's fuzzy. I just remember the flirting. It was obvious, even when we were ""just friends.""

Then one night, she calls me. It was past midnight, I was drowning in notes for college, but seeing her name pop up... I was happy. And then she hit me with it: ""What are we?"" We talked for three hours. Three. The whole time, this question was just hanging there. She was waiting for me to answer. I stayed quiet for so long, just thinking. It was an online thing, you know? Was it worth it? Could it ruin our friendship? But... I had feelings. It was obvious. So I said yes. I said I wanted more.

The first few months of the relationship were... awkward. Our texts got weird and formal. It was like we forgot how to talk. But we got through it, and it became amazing. We'd call for hours, send stupid photos, talk about everything. It was love, I'm sure of it.

Then the first red flag. I was finishing college and looking at universities. I found this great one in her city ‚Äì and it really is one of the best, it wasn't just for her. I told her, and she offered to help. She was applying there too, so she went to an open day. I thought it was sweet.

She met this guy in the uni's online group. She said her friends were busy, so she was going with him. Okay, fine. Whatever.

But on the day... she just vanished. Normally, she'd text me throughout the day, no matter what. But that day, radio silence. I got this knot in my stomach. I felt jealous, but I told myself I was crazy. When she finally replied, she was all excited about the uni, sent a bunch of pics. The place looked so cool, I forgot about being worried. But after that... she started being distant sometimes. Not often, but I noticed.

My final year of college was hell. Exams, my thesis, all that crap. But I got into the uni. On a scholarship. I was over the moon. She seemed really happy for me too.

I moved to her city. The first time we met in person... it was everything. So warm. We started spending all our time together.

And then... the phone thing. We were at my apartment. She was showing me something on her phone. She had a folder of favorite photos in Telegram. I asked if I could look. She said yes.

I'm scrolling, and suddenly her face just... drops. ""Give me the phone,"" she says. I laughed, teased her, ""What, you hiding something?"" It was a joke! But she got so defensive. So aggressive. It was weird.

Okay, I know this was wrong. I know. But I had this gut feeling. I ran to the bedroom and locked the door. I kept scrolling. And I found a video. Of her and that guy. Hugging. And it was weird because she'd sent me pics from the open day ‚Äì it was cold, she was wearing a jacket. But in this video, they're both in t-shirts. I found more photos with him, from different days. Just hugging, being touchy.

I opened the door, handed her the phone with the video playing. She looked... guilty. I asked her when she saw him all those other times. We told each other everything! She never mentioned it. Not once. Her excuse? ""I didn't think it was important to say who I was with. I said I was with friends."" I was hurt, but we kinda just... moved on.

After that, she wouldn't stop talking about him. Jokes, stories about how he ""understood"" her. It made me sick. I realized I'd never seen their chat. I asked her, straight up, where it was. She said she stopped talking to him and deleted it. But she always said he was such a good friend? Why delete it? I kept pushing. Finally, she admitted he had a thing for her, and she knew, but she kept him around as a ""friend."" Sure. Yeah, I believe that. I was so mad she never told me.

We patched things up, I guess. But then she became so up and down. One day she's all over me, the next she's cold and I can't get a word out. We almost broke up in a coffee shop once. She started crying, and I... I comforted her. Told her I wouldn't leave. We stayed together.

Then in winter, at my place, she makes a joke about that guy again. I just snapped. I sat next to her and asked, ""What happened between you two? Tell me the truth."" I don't know what I regret more ‚Äì asking, or not leaving right then.

She said they didn't sleep together. But she told me they were walking by the river, sat on a bench. He picked her up and put her on his lap. And she didn't stop him. She said she ""didn't see a problem with it."" She only got off when he slid his hand under her shirt and rubbed her back. And even then, it took her ages to finally stop talking to him... only because I was about to move to the city.

I was so furious. I don't even remember what I felt. She started crying. And guess what? I ended up comforting her. Again. But something broke in me that day.

We fought all the time after that. I couldn't trust her. She lied. She made this guy out to be some saint. Bullshit.

I got jealous of everyone. I complained about her new friends, about how she acted.

She always chose her friends over me. She'd go quiet for days. Never planned any dates, even though I begged her to show me the city, to go to the planetarium.

She made nasty ""jokes"" about me. My best friend saw it and told me it was fucking disrespectful.

Nothing I did was ever enough. I helped her with her homework, with everything. I almost never said no. Only when I literally couldn't.

She'd flirt with people and hide that we were together. When I asked her to ditch the guys who were clearly into her, she refused.

She'd get mad if I was 5 minutes late, but I was the one always ordering her Ubers to come over and go home, because she stayed out so late.

Once, she invited me to go horseback riding with her and her friend. I had a bad feeling. When they were gone, I looked at her phone. I went into the chat with her best friend. I looked for my name. I wish I hadn't. She was talking shit about me. Making fun of me for being late that one time. Her friend was joining in, and she was just laughing. I put the phone down and cried. I wanted to leave so bad, but I didn't. I waited and left with her.

Somehow, we lasted until summer. She got a job, 10 AM to 11 PM. We never talked. I got it, she was busy. But she got colder. She couldn't even text ""home safe."" I worried.

I finally snapped. I sent her a huge text, all my grievances. It was harsh, but true. When we called, she said we should break up.

I asked why. She said I ""talk too much and do nothing."" That I'm ""controlling and jealous."" Me. Who moved cities for her. Who helped her with everything. Who never missed a birthday or a holiday. Who worried, supported, sent her money when I was broke myself. Who came to see her for 15 minutes even when it was a hassle. The buses from my place to hers stopped after 8 PM, and I'd still be going home at 9 or 10.

So yeah. According to her, I did nothing. I didn't invest. I didn't want to change. Even though she ignored me when I asked her to stop flirting, to stop mentioning that guy. I put up with her coldness every other week. I gave her everything.

And the best part? That summer, she was taking driving lessons. Her instructor was some young guy she knew. I found out later she started dating him. And guess when she went totally cold? Right when he became her instructor. I don't have proof, but come on. I know what it was.",1,1759549721.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1nxjo5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1nxjo5b/it_happened_so_unbelievably_fast/,It happened so unbelievably fast,"I was sitting with all 3 of my cats watching tv this morning, had only just had my coffee. My husband took a picture of us all on the couch at 11:02 and who could have known it was the last photo we‚Äôd have of him acting normal. 

At 11:51 I took the first video I have of him when he was rolling around the floor screaming and I noticed his back legs weren‚Äôt working. To hear the sound of them yelling in pain that sounds nothing like any other noises they make is just excruciating. 

There is something so absurd about sitting in traffic while your baby screams and hyperventilates and rolls around in a circle in his carrier trying to stand up, and I look out the window and see people enjoying their Friday; riding bikes in big groups sightseeing and buses of hop on hop off tours go by. That was me yesterday, spending the day out and going to a museum. Now I feel guilty that I wasn‚Äôt at home holding him. 

We got the ER at exactly 1 and when I walked in with him in the carrier absolutely screaming, I have never cared less for a whole room of people to stare at me. I start bawling and luckily they take him straight back and give us a room to cry in. At this point I thought maybe it was a little broken leg or something and we‚Äôd be out with some meds and now I wish it had been that. 

Apparently he has really bad heart disease and it was a saddle blood clot and there was an even bigger one in his heart so even if we did the treatment with him in the hospital for 3 days to see if they could break it up, he would be in tons of pain and as much as I wanted to be selfish I know it was the right choice to say goodbye. He‚Äôs 11, has had his teeth removed and an ear polyp removed only a month before- the fur on his little leg hadn‚Äôt even grown back from that- so we know he‚Äôs been in pain for a very long time. We had no idea of a heart issue though and I just wish we had known so we could have spent our last day with him better. 

I‚Äôm just trying to be thankful that we were both luckily home and we acted quickly and we got to be there with him and hold him one last time. We said goodbye at 5:45 pm and had spent the whole time there crying and all evening crying and we can‚Äôt focus on anything and just keep imagining him on our laps or in his favorite bed. In less than 6 hours he was just gone. I don‚Äôt know how anyone makes these decisions, neither of us has had to experience grief as an adult yet and I could never have imagined it would hurt this bad. He was 11, and we‚Äôve been married 12 years so had him almost our whole marriage, my whole adult life, he‚Äôs always been there and I‚Äôve never actually considered a world where he wasn‚Äôt. 

It‚Äôs comforting to know that so many people here feel the same, I have felt overly dramatic crying literally all day straight but it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one. But reading people still crying about their loss years from now just makes me think how we‚Äôre in for a rough go still. 

We brought home some fur and had the others sniff it but I still can‚Äôt tell if they understand. It‚Äôs breaking my heart anew every time I see them, see his spots, or think about everything I could have done differently.

I imagine there is some sort of coffee/tea making set up?

I asked my local coffee shop if we can use it to hold our meetings their from now on, but the club's schedule wouldn't work there (meetings run from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm and the coffee shop closes at 6 in the afternoon or earlier I think). I also haven't told the rest of the club members about this just yet, because I didn't want to scare them off.

What should I do going forward? Ask other business around if they are available? Maybe even change the change the schedule to accommodate the coffee shop's opening times, like maybe 3-4 pm first Saturday of every month?",5,1759549136.0,Fantasy,0,1.0,False

But there was he reading his machine, repeating the tornado that had taken place in the past weeks. A mere refreshing linking of old times slowly transformed to something of far greater intricacy and sophistication, shot through with hope and confusion and all the uninhibited emotional candour.

He could discover the parts of his psychology that nobody has known about over years. He remembered his previous misfortunes, the mental barriers that he had built after leaving military work and the levels of tension and stress that he had struggled to overcome. She was a good listener and he felt she understood the vulnerability of these interstitial moments that he felt offered a touch of genuineness.

Then there arose complications: of other interlocutors, of whether she felt him as a temporary comfort only, or as one of more solid substance. He started speculating about whether he was a temporary manager as she tried to define her own emotional terrain.

He had engaged in many maneuvers: he took the coffee in the mornings, he listened in the afternoons and afterwards, when the therapy had taken place, he promised, he adjusted his own travels, to indicate solemnity. Each of the acts was satirical, extreme reactions: once she had received him at her house and once she had spoken to a new person or revoked an appointment.

In the end he realised that this chapter was not merely about her story but his chance to familiarize himself with the complexities of managing vulnerability and trust. He knew that people tend to be at opposite ends in their recovery journey and no matter how much he may love her, he could not hasten her feelings or his.

He, therefore, expelled a breath that further reminded him that this is just but an episode among falls. He would extract teachings, about emotional intelligence, self-limitations and the kind of love he true desired and would proceed on. He would still have retained the belief that deep loving could not be misplaced, though it would hurt, and in time, maybe, he would find a significant other who would be capable of meeting him halfway.",1,1759548813.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1nxjivu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nxjivu/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting?,"So I(F22) have a friend(F19). She and I have been friends since we were born cause our families used to go to the same church before my family left(we are still Christians but we just worship in silence everyday instead of in a building once a week). She has 6 blood siblings and 8 step siblings ranging from new born through 17. The older 4 (13f, 13f, 15f, and 17f) run a seasonal coffee shop that closed on October 1st for the winter. 

When we left the church wheh I was 7ish, the grandparents of my friend tried to seed strife with my parents and force them to return(like the Mormon cult but not of that sect. We were Assembly of God), so we had a tense relationship for a while then the girls were able to play with me again. Later in 2021 my friend‚Äôs mother was m**dered and the father remarried a widow. 

Ever since it‚Äôs felt like my friend‚Äôs dad and step mom have been trying to push me away from my friend even tho I haven‚Äôt changed at all. I think it‚Äôs cause of how they are apart of the church and see those who leave the church as leaving the faith when that‚Äôs üíØ not the case. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off topic. 

On the last day of the coffee shop being open, I went over as usual(I like supporting my friends‚Äô business and it helps me get out of the house once a day for an hour or so and socialize). While I was there, my friend‚Äôs parents came to the shop and the dad told me that people were commenting online(he said Square but I think he meant Facebook cause the village is mostly on there(im not) and it‚Äôs gossip central for the bored village folk), that there‚Äôs a, quote, ‚Äúcreepy girl hanging around the coffee shop acting, well I won‚Äôt say exactly what they said, but being creepy‚Äù. And he basically insinuated that I should be banned from the store because the villagers think I‚Äôm‚Ä¶the p word. 

Now in our village there‚Äôs about half a dozen registered p-words that are allowed and even given ‚Äúproduct‚Äù because they are ‚Äúgood dancers‚Äù. We live in a tribal community and lots of them‚Ä¶well if you know remote Alaska villages you‚Äôd understand‚Ä¶.they hide those kinds of criminals and excuse their behavior especially since 90% of the population is related to each other. 

My family in particular are called ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù. We are people who aren‚Äôt related to the people in the tribe houses and so we are ostracized and used as scapegoats. My father when I was a kid had to fight to protect our house from being stolen because he renovated an old ww2 army hangar and made it something(our village has a tendency to squash anything new and anyone with passion for making this village not a slum). I was bullied and nearly drowned as a child because the parents of the village kids would sick their spawns on me cause I would go to the village for soccer and swimming. 

And earlier this year I was fired from my job because rumors spread that I was calling people ‚Äúcertain r*cial words‚Äù when I literally have a panic attack if I heard that word because mom drilled it into my head to never say anything bad about the tribes. Especially since the tribes were warrior tribes that would fight each other when they had no outsiders to fight. 


I can‚Äôt wait to leave this god forsaken place next month. 

My online friends that I told this incident to are appalled at how the village treat me and at my friend‚Äôs father for stooping to their level. Especially since he knows my family‚Äôs integrity and knew me since I was a child. 

My dad thinks that he probably had harassment too, like my family did, and that the pressure made him cave to try to impress the locals. 

It just saddens me. I h@te this accursed village.

1nxjiu0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxjiu0,Did the NYC -> Poughkeepsie Century today via 9W and Empire State Trail,"Averaged 16 mph over 106.5 miles. It was sick. 

Started in Queens, entered Manhattan via the Queensboro Bridge, shot across to the west side bike path and took that up to the George Washington Bridge, then got on 9W. Shot up that to Nyack and went back across the Hudson over the super long Tappan Zee/Cuomo bridge and entered the trail near the Tarrytown Lakes. 

Gorgeous scenery along the Empire State Trail, especially after Brewster. Highly recommend this ride ü§ôüèª. Did it solo but next time I‚Äôd love to do it with a few people. I took the Metro North back to Grand Central from Poughkeepsie, which was roughly a two hour train ride. Took the train home to Queens after arriving at GC. 

Breakfast was steel cut oats, Greek yogurt, craisins, and a sliced up banana. And black coffee. 

During the ride I dedicated one water bottle to Gatorade (I brought blue frost powder with me and used that) and the other bottle was for water with LMNT citrus lime packets. Stopped twice for refills but definitely needed to have a third refill in there somewhere. Went for a couple long stretches with little liquid in the bottles. 

For food during the ride I ate uncrustables, fig newtons, nerds clusters, and clif bars. I‚Äôve been having stomach issues during long rides though so if anyone has any recommendations for fueling during long rides (century or longer) please let me know. I did a 128.5 mile ride recently and the stomach pain was brutal. Had to stop to use the restroom about five times. Felt very bloated and gassy. My only guess is that the refined sugars are causing the bloating, gas and pain. I love the uncrustables though I cannot lie. They‚Äôre my little treat after I‚Äôve conquered a huge climb or after completing about 70 miles or so. I ate two of them today, not sure if the bread in those could be causing the pain too. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! ",9,1759548781.0,NYCbike,0,1.0,False

But there was he reading his machine, repeating the tornado that had taken place in the past weeks. A mere refreshing linking of old times slowly transformed to something of far greater intricacy and sophistication, shot through with hope and confusion and all the uninhibited emotional candour.

He could discover the parts of his psychology that nobody has known about over years. He remembered his previous misfortunes, the mental barriers that he had built after leaving military work and the levels of tension and stress that he had struggled to overcome. She was a good listener and he felt she understood the vulnerability of these interstitial moments that he felt offered a touch of genuineness.

Then there arose complications: of other interlocutors, of whether she felt him as a temporary comfort only, or as one of more solid substance. He started speculating about whether he was a temporary manager as she tried to define her own emotional terrain.

He had engaged in many maneuvers: he took the coffee in the mornings, he listened in the afternoons and afterwards, when the therapy had taken place, he promised, he adjusted his own travels, to indicate solemnity. Each of the acts was satirical, extreme reactions: once she had received him at her house and once she had spoken to a new person or revoked an appointment.

In the end he realised that this chapter was not merely about her story but his chance to familiarize himself with the complexities of managing vulnerability and trust. He knew that people tend to be at opposite ends in their recovery journey and no matter how much he may love her, he could not hasten her feelings or his.

He, therefore, expelled a breath that further reminded him that this is just but an episode among falls. He would extract teachings, about emotional intelligence, self-limitations and the kind of love he true desired and would proceed on. He would still have retained the belief that deep loving could not be misplaced, though it would hurt, and in time, maybe, he would find a significant other who would be capable of meeting him halfway.",1,1759548747.0,RomanceWriters,0,0.67,False

Say something below and I will definitely give you the link for free reading.","# Chapter 1

I went to my grave still wondering why my parents only loved that fake heiress even after they got me back.

Why did even my own fianc√© choose her over me?

I died in that moldy rented room in the slums. The stomach cancer pain kept me curled up all night long.

Even in my final moments, I still naively clung to the hope that my death would at least make them regret, and that it would finally dawn on them: I was the one they'd loved all along.

But when my soul drifted back home, what I saw was the fake heiress beaming in her wedding dress, while my parents were busy with her wedding preparations.

And my ashes were scattered like garbage among the rose bushes in the garden.

No one remembered me, nor did anyone mourn me.

I died in the rented room, less than 100 square feet, in a corner of the slums reeking of mold and decay.

Stomach cancer gnawed at me like a dull blade, slowly severing my last thread of life.

Curled up on a mattress with springs poking through the worn fabric, I felt life slipping through my fingers‚Äîjust like all the love and warmth that should have been mine over these past 23 years slipping from me.

As my soul left my body, I felt an unexpected sense of relief.

There would be no more searing pain in my stomach. I no longer needed to work three jobs just to pay for medical bills and rent. I could stop crying myself to sleep every night and wondering why my birth parents didn't love me.

My soul floated in the air and looked down at the rotting corpse on the bed. That was me, Emily Donovan.

I was once the heiress of the Donovan family, yet now, I was tossed aside like trash in this dark corner.

My corpse had begun to turn greenish, with horrifying lividity marks spreading across the skin.

My hair was dry and straw-like, and my cheeks were so sunken that I was barely recognizable as human.

Who would have thought this skinny woman was once the dazzling heiress of the Donovan family?

""How bitterly ironic,"" I muttered to myself, even though I knew no one could hear me. ""Lilith must be dressed up in designer clothes right now, being the center of attention in the Donovans.""

Time seemed to lose all meaning in my spirit form.

I lost track of time until the door was suddenly kicked open.

A uniformed officer rushed in, only to stagger back out, gagging. ""Holy crap, the smell is awful. She's been dead for at least a week.""

The officers covered their noses and cautiously edged closer to my body.

I hovered nearby, watching as they rifled through my belongings for my ID and then called my family.

One officer said with his phone in hand, ""Hello, is that Mr. Dylan Donovan? I'm an officer at Westgate Station. I'm sorry to inform you, your daughter, Emily Donovan, passed away in her rented apartment. Preliminary assessment suggests natural causes. Yes, she's been dead for several days...""

I held my breath‚Äîif a soul could even do that‚Äîwaiting for their reaction on the other end of the line.

Would they cry or be shocked? Would they finally feel regret?

""Oh, I see."" My father's voice on the other end showed no surprise at all. ""Can you please handle it for us? Just scatter her ashes anywhere possible.""

The officer frowned and asked, ""Won't you come to claim her body?""

""It's not necessary. We're busy,"" my father replied, and the call ended abruptly.

At that moment, I felt something deep in my soul shatter beyond repair.

Even in death, the agony of being so utterly ignored cut just as sharp.

The officer shook his head and said to his colleague, ""People in rich families are so cold. I heard this girl is the Donovan family's true heiress, but even after they found her, they never really cherished her. She ran away on her own.""

""What a tragedy. Lying dead for so long before anyone noticed her,"" the officer sighed.

I was zipped into a body bag and sent to the mortuary.

All I had was the cheapest cremation furnace‚Äîno family showed up, no formal funeral, not a single person to bid me farewell.

My body turned to ashes in the flames, as if I had never existed at all.

As the clerk was about to place my ashes into a cheap plastic can, a phone call came in.

""Mr. Donovan? What, you've changed your mind? Of course, we'll deliver the ashes to the place immediately,"" said the clerk on the phone.

Stunned, I found myself drifting after the hearse carrying my ashes, all the way back to Donovan Manor.

For a moment, I couldn't help but wonder‚Äîhad they finally come to regret it?

Could it be they still couldn't bear to let me go?

The car pulled up in Donovan Manor's backyard. The gardener took the urn and dug a small hole beneath the rose bushes.

The gardener told his assistant, ""Mr. Donovan said to scatter the ashes here. They can feed the flowers. After all, she's got Donovan's blood. In the end, she rests at home.""

I hovered numbly in the air, watching as my own ashes were poured into the earth, destined to nourish Lilith's precious roses.

Was this what they called ""rest at home""? Was this the family love I'd always yearned for?

Just then, laughter drifted from the house.

I drifted through the wall and saw a party underway in the grand hall.

Lilith stood encircled by admirers in her custom-made white gown, radiant like a princess.

My parents, no, Dylan and Mary, looked at her with doting smiles.

My older brother, Declan Donovan, was adjusting her necklace, his eyes brimming with brotherly affection.

Mary opened a velvet box to reveal a diamond necklace and said, ""Lilith, this is the engagement gift your father and I prepared for you. Jerry is a good man. You two are a perfect match.""

Jerry Cooper was my former fianc√©.

He now stood beside Lilith, his arm around her waist, his eyes filled with love.

""Thank you, Mom and Dad,"" Lilith said sweetly. She stood on tiptoe to plant a kiss on Jerry's cheek. ""And thank you, Jerry, for your love.""

The room erupted in warm laughter, while I watched the scene above, invisible and forgotten.

Not a single person remembered that today was the day they cast my ashes into their precious garden.

I floated right before Lilith, fixing my ghostly gaze on her delicate face.

She suddenly shuddered and shrank into Jerry's arms.

""What's wrong?"" Jerry asked with concern.

""Nothing, just felt a sudden chill."" Lilith forced a smile, though her eyes darted nervously.

Could this woman who stole everything from me sense me?

The party lasted well into the night.

After all the guests left, Dylan and Mary sat in the living room, chatting while sipping coffee.

""The police called today,"" Dylan said abruptly. ""They said Emily was dead.""

Mary's hand paused for a moment, then she gracefully resumed stirring her coffee. ""Really? How did she die?""

Dylan replied, ""Stomach cancer. I had them scatter her ashes in the garden.""

""Well."" Mary took a sip of coffee. ""Lilith's engagement to Jerry is next month. I gotta finalize their gowns and suits soon.""

Just like that, they casually brushed off my death and moved on to discussing the menu for Lilith's engagement party.

I stood right before them, screaming and wailing hysterically‚Äîbut of course, they couldn't hear a single sound.

Declan came downstairs, overhearing his parents discussing Lilith's engagement. With a smile, he chimed in, ""Lilith will look stunning in a white dress. By the way, didn't she say she likes that Harry Winston diamond ring...""

They were engrossed in animated discussions and plans, as though a girl named Emily had never existed in their world.

I floated upstairs to what was once my room.

Now it had been completely converted into Lilith's walk-in closet. Every trace of my belongings disappeared.

Only a small photo frame remained in the corner: a family portrait of Dylan, Mary, Declan, and Lilith.

I was excluded from this so-called family, as if I'd never been found by them at all.

Memories flooded back like waves.

Three years earlier, when Dylan and Mary showed up at the restaurant where I worked, I could hardly believe my eyes.

They told me a DNA test revealed there'd been a hospital mix-up when I was born. I was actually their real daughter.

""Come home with us, dear,"" Mary said, tears glistening in her eyes.

I thought that was the start of my happily-ever-after.

I dreamed of finally having a real family and a true home.

I was even naive enough to believe that Lilith and I would bond as sisters.

But reality soon shattered my illusions.

On my very first day back at Donovan Manor, Lilith ""accidentally"" spilled red wine all over the only decent dress I owned. It was a birthday gift from the restaurant owner. It was the nicest piece of clothing I had.

""Oh dear, I'm so sorry,"" Lilith said, batting her innocent eyes at me. ""I didn't mean to do that, Millie. You won't be mad at me, will you?""

Dylan immediately comforted her. ""It's just an old dress. Lilith, I will take you shopping for a new one tomorrow.""

And there I stood, my dress soaked and clinging to me, and not even a single towel was offered.

That night, I overheard Lilith talking on the phone in her room, ""Relax, that country bumpkin won't last long. You know what, she can't even use proper cutlery.""

The days that followed were a living nightmare.

No matter how hard I studied etiquette or buried myself in lessons, I could never measure up to Lilith in my family's eyes.

All she had to do was a few sweet words, and they'd give her everything I'd ever longed for.

What hurt me the most was Jerry. He was meant to be my fianc√©‚Äîour families had arranged our engagement the day I was born.

""Millie, I just don't think we're right for each other,"" Jerry told me, though his eyes kept drifting to Lilith, who was swinging on the swing in the garden. ""You and Lilith... are worlds apart.""

Yeah, we were indeed worlds apart.

She was a rose cultivated with care, while I was just a roadside weed, ignored by all.

The day I ran away from home, my family held a grand birthday party for Lilith.

She wore a couture gown, looking like a true princess.

Meanwhile, I huddled in the shadows in a borrowed dress that didn't quite fit.

In front of everyone, she said sweetly, ""Millie, I heard you used to work in a restaurant, right? Why don't you put on a show for us and demonstrate how you used to carry trays?""

Amidst the laughter of the guests, I saw Dylan and Mary laughing too, and even Declan couldn't help but chuckle.

Jerry stood with his arm possessively around Lilith's waist. He gazed at her with doting amusement as she delivered her cruel performance.

That night, I packed my few meager belongings, left a letter behind, and walked out of Donovan Manor without a single backward glance.

It had been three years since I walked out of that door.

Over the past three years, I scraped by on countless odd jobs, slept rough under bridges, and finally ended up in this dingy rented room in the slums.

I worked myself to the bone, desperate to prove I could survive without the Donovan family.

But then stomach cancer came for me, and I couldn't afford treatment.

Even in my final moments, I still clung to the naive hope that my death would make the Donovans regret, and that it would finally dawn on them that they'd loved me all along.

But now, watching them bustling about for Lilith's engagement, it finally dawned on me that to them, my life and death were nothing significant.

As a spirit, I knew tears were impossible.

Yet scalding trails still ran down my cheeks.

I drifted into the garden, watching my own ashes sink into the soil.

""Is this how my story ends?"" I asked the night sky, but only silence answered.

The house's lights still blazed brightly, faint laughter drifting through the night.

Lilith's life would keep shining, while I'd forever be just ashes nourishing her roses.

How bitterly ironic my life was.

I finally did ""come home""‚Äîin the most humiliating way imaginable.

# Chapter 2

My soul was trapped in Donovan Manor, drifting like a forgotten ghost through the halls of the home that should have been mine.

The engagement party had ended, and the house finally settled into silence.

The moonlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a faint blue glow upon my soul, reflected on the marble floor.

Lilith walked upstairs arm in arm with Jerry, her laughter hearty and crisp.

I drifted behind them, watching as Jerry tenderly kissed her forehead and as she coyly nudged his chest at the door.

""Good night, my dear,"" Jerry murmured in a tender voice.

That scene cut right through me.

When I first came to the house, Jerry was the only one who showed me kindness.

I remember how he would patiently teach me to use all those intricate pieces of silverware, and after Lilith played her little tricks on me, he'd discreetly slip me a handkerchief.

He reassured me. ""Don't be mad at Lilith. She's just a bit spoiled.""

How foolish I was to think he truly cared about me.

I didn't realize the truth until that day when I caught them kissing in the garden.

When Lilith spotted me, she didn't let go of Jerry. Instead, she locked eyes with me and kissed even more affectionately with a defiant look.

Jerry's arm wrapped tightly around her waist, as if she were the most precious treasure in the world.

I drifted after Lilith into her bedroom‚Äîthe very room that should have been mine.

She hummed a tune as she removed her makeup, pausing to admire her flawless features in the mirror.

Suddenly, her expression froze, and a shadow passed over her eyes.

""I know you're watching,"" she said to the empty air.

I suddenly froze. Could she actually sense me?

""Emily, if you're really here, then enjoy the show,"" she said with a cold smile. ""Watch how I take everything that should have been yours. Jerry, Mom and Dad's love, and everything the Donovan family has all belong to me now.""

My soul shuddered, fury blazing within me like an uncontrollable fire.

I realized in shock that she knew it all along.

She knew exactly what she was doing and knew what she was stealing from me.

Lilith walked over to the dressing table and carefully took out a small box from the drawer's deepest corner.

She opened it, revealing a photo of Jerry and me.

That was the only photo we ever took together.

My face in the photo was riddled with pinpricks, barely recognizable‚Äîlike she wanted to erase me completely.

""Do you really think he ever had feelings for you?"" she sneered at the photo. ""It was nothing but pity. I told him to get close to you and be nice to you‚Äîall so that when you lose him, the pain would be absolutely crushing.""

Her words slithered into my ears like a venomous snake.

It turned out that it was a trap from the very beginning.

Lilith picked up the scissors and cut the photo into fragments.

""How wonderful that you're dead,"" she whispered. ""Now, no one will ever say the Donovan family has a daughter raised in the slums. I'm the one and only heiress of the Donovan family now.""

I lunged at her, desperate to wrap my hands around her slender neck, but my fingers passed right through her body.

I forgot I was already dead. I became just a helpless soul.

Lilith suddenly shuddered and touched her neck. ""That's weird,"" she muttered, frowning before walking toward the bathroom.

I drifted out of the room, through the hallway, and into Dylan and Mary's bedroom.

They had already fallen asleep. Mary's head rested on Dylan's shoulder, making a perfect picture of marital bliss.

How ironic. They showed nothing but cold indifference to their own flesh and blood, yet were so affectionate with each other.

""Dylan,"" Mary murmured drowsily in her sleep, ""don't forget to invite the mayor to Lilith's engagement party...""

Even in their dreams, they were still thinking about Lilith.

To them, I was nothing more than a speck of dust.

I was about to drift away, but Dylan's voice suddenly cut through the silence.

""Well... Should we tell Declan about Emily's death?"" His voice was barely above a whisper, yet it pierced through the stillness of the night.

Mary rolled over and scoffed, ""Why bother? She chose to run away from home. She brought her death to herself.""

""But she is our birth daughter, after all,"" Dylan murmured.

Mary sneered, ""Oh, come on. Forget it. Lilith is the one we raised. Emily is just a vulgar, crude girl with no sense of basic manners. Do you know what neighbors say behind our backs? They say we brought home a country bumpkin.""

""Well..."" Dylan sighed. ""It's probably for the best that she's gone. Otherwise, Lilith would've been devastated.""

I hovered there. The pain in my heart was so raw that it felt like my soul was being ripped to shreds.

That was how my parents reacted upon hearing I was dead.

I worked myself to the bone trying to earn their approval‚Äîstudying etiquette, cramming for extra classes, and even enrolling in an elite private school.

No matter how hard I tried, in their eyes, I would always be the vulgar country bumpkin.

Lilith, on the other hand, didn't have to lift a finger to get all their love.

I drifted out of their bedroom and floated into Declan's room.

I still remember his gentle smile when I first came home.

But that smile quickly faded, giving way to impatience and icy indifference.

Declan was still working on his computer.

The glow from the screen illuminated his sharply defined features‚Äîa face that bore some resemblance to mine. We both inherited Dylan's tall nose and Mary's thin lips.

His phone lit up with a message from Lilith. \[Declan, can you come with me to try on wedding dresses tomorrow?\]

Declan replied instantly. \[Sure, my little princess.\]

Princess‚Äîthat was what he always called Lilith. But me? He'd either coldly call me by my name, or worse, act like I didn't even exist.

Beside his computer sat a framed photo of Declan and Lilith together.

In the photo, Declan was giving little Lilith a piggyback ride, both of them beaming.

That was a memory forever beyond my reach.

I suddenly remembered that shortly after I returned to the Donovan family, I summoned up the courage to ask Declan if he could take me out too.

""I'm busy,"" he muttered without looking up, his eyes glued to his phone.

""Just one hour,"" I pleaded, barely daring to look up. ""Maybe we could go grab a coffee, or...""

""Can you just stop bugging me?"" He scowled and snapped, ""Lilith never pestered me like this.""

I remember that night, Lilith skipped cheerfully into Declan's room, clinging to his arm and asking him in a sweet voice to watch a movie with her.

Without a moment's hesitation, Declan dropped everything and accompanied Lilith to the home theater.

I stood in the shadows of the hallway, watching them walk away together. For the first time, it hit me that in this family, I'd always be an outsider.

Memories came flooding back, and I couldn't help but recall just how blatantly Declan favored Lilith over me.

On her birthday, he surprised her with a brand-new sports car.

On my birthday, he couldn't even be bothered to pick out a gift himself‚Äîhe just told his assistant to grab a random designer handbag to brush me off.

When Lilith caught a cold, he drove through the night to get her favorite food. But when I was burning up with a 104-degree fever, he didn't even step into my room.

And now I was dead, and Declan didn't even know that. Or maybe he did, but it made no difference to him.

I drifted over to Declan's desk and watched as he opened a folder. Inside were the meticulous planning documents for Lilith's engagement party.

He pored over every detail, making occasional notes, with the kind of focus you'd expect from someone closing a multi-million dollar contract.

""Lilith's engagement party must be absolutely flawless,"" he murmured to himself.

What about my funeral? What about my death? Did I not even deserve a single thought?

Rage and sorrow surged violently through my soul, and suddenly, an eerie wind swept through the room.

Declan shuddered and glanced up at the AC vent.

""That's strange,"" he muttered absentmindedly and immediately returned to his work.

I couldn't bear to watch it any longer. Drifting through the walls, I went to the garden.

In the garden, my ashes had already blended into the soil.

Tomorrow, the gardener would plant new rose bushes here‚ÄîLilith's favorite variety.

What a cruel irony. My life ended right here, reduced to nothing but fertilizer for her happiness.

As the night breeze swept by, I was suddenly overcome with deep exhaustion.

Could a soul grow weary? I had no idea.

But I knew I was trapped here, with no escape from this torment.

I was trapped in this place that should have been my ""home,"" forced to watch as those who took everything from me continued living their happy lives.

One by one, the lights in the house went out, until only Lilith's room remained bright.

Drifting closer, I saw Lilith on a video call with Jerry.

""Jerry, I'm so happy today,"" she cooed. Her feigned voice made me sick. ""You know what? I keep feeling Emily's soul is watching me.""

Jerry chuckled from the other end of the screen. ""Stop overthinking. She's dead. She'll never bother us again.""

""But..."" Lilith nibbled her lower lip in pretended worry, her voice dropping slightly. ""What if she really has become a ghost?""

""So what?"" Jerry's voice turned icy. ""She couldn't even compete with you when she was alive, and what could she possibly do after she died?""

His words were the final straw that completely shattered my last shred of hope.

I was naive enough to believe that Jerry had ever truly cared for me, even just a little.

Now I finally understood that I was nothing but a pathetic joke in their love game.",1,1759548545.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False

My mouth fell open as I continued to stare at the scene in front of me. I blinked several times to check if I was hallucinating but no matter how much I close my eyes and opened them, the scene never changed..","# Chapter 1

I felt like a new born who was just seeing the world for the first time.

I could not help it, after being blind for three years, it was a privilege to see again. I held the cake I had bought to celebrate the recovery of my sight with my fiancee Nathan. He had been supportive to me for the past three years and I wanted to show him how grateful I was. It was also his birthday so it was a double celebration for us. You seem to be in high spirit ma'am,"" The cab driver commented as he stopped in front of the estate Nathan and I shared. Yes I am,"" I answered as I gave him his money and came outside. The weather suddenly changed and it started drizzling. I quickened my footsteps as the drizzling rain turned into a downpour. I got inside quickly and opened the door with excitement. I rushed in happily but the scene I met stopped me in my tracks. My mouth fell open as I continued to stare at the scene in front of me. I blinked several times to check if I was hallucinating but no matter how much I close my eyes and opened them, the scene never changed. Right before my eyes was my fiancee kissing and smooching another woman. My hands clutched tightly to the cake. My clothes were drenched from the rain because I had used them to cover the cake so it would not be ruined by the rain. I stood there motionlessly until Nathan finally noticed me. He looked at me with desires in his eyes but they were not for me. ""Aurora is here, let's reduce our noise,"" He said in a teasing tone to the woman as he crushed his mouth to hers.

I knew I could not tell him the goodnews because of what I had witnessed so I continued to act blind while I watched painfully as they continued their romance.

After a while, the woman detached herself from Nathan and sighed.

""Relax babe, Aurora is blind so there is no need for us to be careful because she won't be able to notice anything,"" The woman whispered to Nathan but I could still hear it.

Hearing her voice, I then knew who she was. Vanessa Sinclair. She was Nathan's business partner.

She often visited so while I could recognize her voice, I could not recognize her face because I was blind.

Nathan reluctantly let go of her and faced me. He thought I was still blind so he pretended to see me for the first time. ""Aurora! How are you doing? Why is your clothes wet and what are you doing here? I thought you went abroad for treatment and would not be coming back anytime soon?"" He asked faking concern into his voice. Vanessa scoffed and went to sit on a chair as she watched us. I felt like plucking out his eyes but I had to reign in my emotions. There was too much at stake so I could not act rashly.

""I came back early so I can celebrate your birthday,"" I answered forcing a smile on my face.

""Oh, you should not have bothered, it's not a big deal, getting your eyesight back is more important,"" He said.

""What happened to your voice? Why are you sounding like this?"" I asked with fake concern as I noticed the hoarseness in his voice.

""I caught a cold,"" He stated coldly.

I could see that he was already getting impatient with me because he could not wait to continue his romance with Vanessa.

I was about to say something when he spoke again.

""You know what, why don't you help me get my cold medicine from the coffee table,"" He instructed.

I saw Vanessa stifle her laughter and I wandered what was amusing to her until I reached the coffee table and understood why.

There was no medicine on the table. Instead, what I saw was a box of \*\*\*\*\*\*. I gritted my teeth and balled my hands into a fist.

The bastard! He was testing me to know if I was truly blind. I smiled bitterly to myself. I will make him believe that I was still blind to make him lower his guard so I can plan my next move.

My hand trembled as I picked up the box and gave them to him.

""Thank you Aurora,"" He said with mockery in his voice while Vanessa could barely contained her laughter.



""How did you get a cold?"" I ask.



""I don't know, the weather maybe,"" He answered dismissively.



""Oh, okay,"" I replied.



""It's nothing to concern yourself with, I just need to rest,"" He said and gestured to Vanessa.



She stood up and walked to his outstretched arms.



He carried her in bridal style while she giggled quietly. I watched him carry her into the bedroom, our bedroom.

He got to the door and turned back.

You need to rest Aurora, I don't want you to fall sick and don't worry, we will celebrate the birthday together later at night,"" He informed me and walked inside the room.

I slumped on the floor as I heared the door click shut inside.

The tears came swift and fast and I clutched my chest tightly.

Three years ago, I had lost my eyesight in an attempt to rescue Nathan when he was kidnapped.

He had promised to take care of me and be the eyes I would use to see. To prove his loyalty, he had taken it upon himself to take care of my mother's hospital bills.

I had believed him, I had trusted him but here he was, cheating on me without remorse.

I wanted to expose him but when I thought of my mother and the fear of him retaliating, I knew I had to calm down and bid my time.

I cleaned my eyes and went to the bathroom to wash my face. I washed my face and cleaned it with tissue.

I was about to discard the tissue in the waste bin when my eyes fell on something inside.

I picked it up and saw that it was a pregnancy test strip and it was positive.

I covered my mouth in shock at the realization.

Vanessa was pregnant!

No, he didn't recently turn into a crime against nature. He‚Äôs always been that way.

Well, maybe not always. I think he‚Äôs been getting worse over time. I‚Äôve been feeding him for as long as I can remember, but that can‚Äôt be true. Who fed either of us when I was too young to cook? So he probably used to be something closer to human, but as far as I know he was never even close to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù And that‚Äôs normal to me.

When Mr. Dubois hired me to work at the funeral home over summer breaks (calm down, it was just landscaping) he reassured me that it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing what the human mind can become accustomed to. Trust me, if ya stick with it long enough, this whole place will feel normal.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at that. Working at a funeral home would *never* be normal. It wasn‚Äôt until my dad asked me to bring him one of the bodies from work that it occurred to me my home life was more abnormal than my work life. It really is crazy what the human mind can become desensitized to. I guess I owe Mr. Dubois an apology. Or not. It was just an eye roll after all. They say he‚Äôs a vegetable nowadays anyway. If anyone owes him an apology, it‚Äôs Dad.

It sure is tough living with an otherworldly monstrosity for family, though. The slime gets on everything. I guess it could be worse. It‚Äôs not as sticky as jelly or something, so it mops up pretty easily. But I have to mop every single night, and it takes like an hour! Some nights I‚Äôm just too tired, and I skip it. But then it spreads and covers all the floors in the house, and even goes up the walls a bit, which means it gets in the food pantry, which for some reason makes all my cap'n crunch grow green fuzzy mold overnight. If I accidentally get a few drops on my clothes in the morning, everyone avoids me on the bus, and hides their noses in their shirts. Drama queens. It‚Äôs not even that bad.

In eighth grade, we had this huge book report on Huckleberry Finn. My teacher really shouldn‚Äôt have given a book with so many slurs to junior high kids. Anyway this report was a huge portion of our grade for the year, and had to be eight pages long, which is crazy long for an eighth grader! To make it worse, Mrs. Colton was an old crone who said it was important for kids to know cursive, so we had to handwrite the whole thing in a dead language. I had put it off way too long, so I stayed up all night before the day it was due. Since I was writing all night, I wasn‚Äôt mopping. And of course it‚Äôs just my luck that I slipped in Dad‚Äôs slime while I was sliding the report into my backpack. And of course all 7 and a half pages landed in the goo. I don‚Äôt remember what slur I borrowed from Mark Twain, but I remember my dad shouting back from the basement.

‚ÄúProtect the written words! The words are the key. Read the book, my son. Read the book and anchor Him.‚Äù

Oh yeah. My dad has this weird book he‚Äôs always trying to get me to read.

Anyway. I changed my clothes and went to school. No time to write a new one, so I figured I‚Äôd just show the teacher my soggy report and explain what happened. Maybe she‚Äôd let me get an extension on the assignment.

I know the slime stinks, but it‚Äôs really not that bad. I guess I had never had more than a drop or two on me at school before. The pages were soaked, though. The moment I pulled the dripping pages out of my backpack, there was vomiting. I think like three different kids had made a mess on the floor. Mrs. Colton was the first one to run out of the classroom, of course. She made such a fuss they evacuated the whole school building. She told the people from the poison control team to burn my report. The bitch gave me a 0% on the assignment and I had to work my butt off the rest of the year just to get a C.

I wonder if I have a mom. Surely my dad couldn‚Äôt possibly be getting any, but I had to come from somewhere, right? I‚Äôm probably adopted if I‚Äôm being realistic. Did my dad just find me as an abandoned kid? But he never leaves the house as far as I can tell. Did someone leave me with him on purpose? I guess my dad is freaky enough he might have just spawned me like a clone.

I forget where I got the idea that parents are supposed to help their kids with math homework. Considering I watched a lot of PBS kids, I‚Äôll make an educated guess and say I probably saw it on Arthur. It probably happened in third grade, because I was having trouble figuring out rounding. I decided that my dad was a dad, like on TV, and dads on TV help with math homework. So I yelled down to the basement asking for some parental guidance.

‚ÄúThe language of the stars belongs to us worms. Come, son. Let me impart that language.‚Äù

I was still afraid of the dark back then, so I had to find the flashlight before carrying my math notebook down into the basement. I wished my dad would just come upstairs, but it‚Äôs awkward for him to use stairwells and doorways since gravity is reversed for him. So I crept down the stairs. I moved painstakingly slowly because the mucous coating on everything made the stairs and the handrail slippery, not that I had a free hand for the handrail anyway. I never know which cocoon he‚Äôll be in until he opens his glowing eyes. Of course that time he was in the furthest back cocoon, the one by the water heater. Nowadays the goop comes up to my shins down in the basement, so in third grade I was really wading through it. I was out of breath when I finally got to my dad‚Äôs ceiling sack of choice for the day. As I struggled to ask whether the number five rounds up or down, my dad quickly grabbed my face and gently pressed some of his thumbs into my eyes. I woke up floating in the muck and ever since then I‚Äôve known calculus. I literally know math that hasn‚Äôt been invented yet. You have no idea how boring eighth grade pre-algebra was. Don‚Äôt worry, though, I won‚Äôt spoil super-tangents for anyone until some mathematician figures it out fair and square. They‚Äôll probably give it a better name than super-tangent anyway.

The summer I was working for Mr. Dubois, I tried to convince Marcus to come work there, too. Marcus is my best friend, but only by default. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not his best friend, but that‚Äôs okay. Anyway I thought it would be fun if I got to work with my only friend, so I was really playing it up. I tried to make operating a weed-eater sound like the coolest, most exciting thing ever. I finally thought I was getting through, but Marcus suddenly got this sad look.

‚ÄúSorry, man. My dad says I have to work at the restaurant this summer. Says it‚Äôs ‚Äòabout time I start taking the family business seriously‚Äô as if I wanna be stuck with that dump all my life.‚Äù

For once, I could relate perfectly to someone else‚Äôs family situation. My dad‚Äôs always pestering me about his stupid book, and I know I can‚Äôt avoid it forever. I don‚Äôt know what will happen when I read it, but I can take a pretty good guess. I hope I at least get to go over to a girl‚Äôs place before I have to take over my family business. Having a destiny sucks.

There‚Äôs this guy in a suit who pretends to be my dad sometimes. He only shows up when you absolutely need to have a parent. Parent-teacher meetings, Christmas pageants, that sort of thing. He wears a black suit with a matching fedora, and always carries a briefcase. Only neckbeards dress like that, but he kinda pulls it off. My nose doesn‚Äôt really work from all the years of slime, but Marcus said my ‚Äúdad‚Äù smells really strong of cigarettes. When I was a kid, I was pretty dumb so I just assumed that was what my dad looked like when he put a suit on. Kind of like how other kids should have realized Santa didn‚Äôt make sense, but they just never questioned it. I should have noticed something was up because he always gave me an envelope with enough cash for the next half a year until I ran into him again. It‚Äôs amazing what the human mind can become accustomed to, I guess. I actually never questioned it until fifth grade parent-teacher meetings. The guy who showed up that time was a little younger, and his hair was a lighter shade. He was sweating bullets, and when I asked who he was, he whispered to me, ‚Äúkeep it down kid, the other guy couldn‚Äôt make it so I‚Äôm filling in. Just act cool okay?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what he was so worried about. Nobody ever met my fake dad more than a couple times ever, so they wouldn‚Äôt notice the difference. It‚Äôs never been hard for me to keep my dad a secret. Actually, I never really had to. Most people don‚Äôt want anything to do with the stinky kid with old clothes. I never talked about my home life because nobody asked, except for Mr. Dubois.

My dad doesn‚Äôt ground me or take my cell phone or something when he punishes me. That would be too normal. He just gives me insomnia. It doesn‚Äôt seem that bad at first, but lack of sleep doesn‚Äôt just hurt your body. It changes your mind directly, and makes you someone you‚Äôre not. It hurts your soul after a while. Anyway my dad got pretty mad at me when I said I wouldn‚Äôt bring him a body from the funeral home. I was pretty adamant about standing up for myself that time. I said I was an adult and I didn‚Äôt have to do what he says. After over 100 hours without sleep, my frontal lobe was so gone I thought I could probably get away with stealing a body on the back of my bicycle. Mr. Dubois flicked on the lights as I was pulling the body bag out of the cooler. What was he doing there? It was 2:07 in the morning! Wait no. I was so sleep deprived I read my watch backwards. It was 7:02.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on here?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhhhhhhhh‚Ä¶Would you believe me if I said my dad told me to?‚Äù

Mr. Dubois sighed deeply when I said that.

‚ÄúSadly, I completely believe you. Put Mrs. Godfrey back in the cooler and come to my office.‚Äù

He gave me a cup of coffee and started talking while I sipped it.

‚ÄúYou know, the biggest part of the funeral business is networking. I have to keep bringing in new clients, since we don‚Äôt get any repeat customers.‚Äù He paused to let me laugh at the joke. I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite literally my job to know everyone living in this town, so that I‚Äôll be the first to know when they pass. But the one person I‚Äôve never seen is your father. It‚Äôs clear from your appearance, the way you have to buy groceries after work, the fact you tried to steal a body; something is very wrong in your home. It‚Äôs unprofessional to say, but sometimes I think of you as the son I never had, and I won‚Äôt let your father hurt you anymore. I won‚Äôt call the police, because you didn‚Äôt actually steal anything yet. But I have your address from your employment forms and I will be visiting your home after work whether you like it or not. Your father and I are going to have a little chat.‚Äù

I know I should have stopped him, or at least warned him what he was walking into. But I had never really had someone take care of me before. It was intoxicating, so I let myself fantasize that Mr. Dubois would rescue me and I‚Äôd live with him happily ever after. In my defense, I hadn‚Äôt slept in five days, so I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight.

That afternoon I threw my bike in the back of Mr. Dubois‚Äô pickup and we rode in silence to my house. I knew before we even got to the door that Dad had left the basement that day. The slime was spilling out from under the front door and dripping off the edge of the porch. I saw Mr. Dubois hesitate for the first time ever. But he overcame his trepidation, held a handkerchief to his face, and pushed open my front door while I peered around his shoulder. He called into the darkness.

‚ÄúMy name is Sinclair Dubois. I‚Äôm here to talk to you about your son. May I come in?‚Äù

From deeper in the house, probably the living room, I heard my dad‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúMagnificent, child. I ask for a dead body, but a living one crosses our threshold.‚Äù

I heard Mr. Dubois whisper something under his breath with a look of confusion. He announced that he was coming in, but his voice was quieter this time. He trudged through the sopping wet foyer towards the darkened living room. If he noticed the slime oozing up the walls, he didn‚Äôt react. Was he brave or just too shocked to think? I didn‚Äôt follow. I stood outside my open front door, and watched him disappear into the darkness of the living room. I didn‚Äôt hear anything. It might have been 5 whole minutes of silence. I just waited there, unsure what to do. And then I heard heavy, pounding footsteps. Mr. Dubois was back in the foyer sprinting for the front door. He got through the doorway and didn‚Äôt stop running. He screamed at me to run too, but I didn‚Äôt move. I just followed him with my eyes. I knew I wasn‚Äôt the one in danger.

Have you ever seen one of those closeups of how a mosquito‚Äôs mouth works? The way it has an arm attached to it that stretches out the straw part and inserts it like a needle? That got him first. It looked like it was right in the back of the neck. Mr. Dubois‚Äô legs kept running and swung out from under him while he was suspended by his neck. Next came an arm. The leathery skin stretched and twisted over a hundred tiny bones as it coiled around his torso like a snake. It pulled him back through the front door. Mr. Dubois clawed at the foyer floor until his fingers bled. He looked up at me with pleading eyes. I wonder what expression I wore when I looked back. He managed to catch himself on the doorway into the living room. He held on for a while, and for a second I thought he might pull free. Then I heard some of Dad‚Äôs pustules burst with exertion, and Mr. Dubois and two hand-sized chunks of the door frame all flew back into the darkness. I could hear Mr. Dubois‚Äô screams, as well as the occasional slurping sound from my dad. I don‚Äôt know how long the screams lasted. In the first five minutes I was in bed and fast asleep.

I woke up roughly 48 hours later. The slime covered every inch of the walls in the house, and some even dripped down on me from the ceiling. I was going to have a rough time cleaning. I checked my phone and saw I had dozens of unread text messages, most of which were from Marcus. Apparently Mr. Dubois had been found in an alley near the Baptist church, and he was scaring strangers by screaming at them about hands and elephant trunks. The police came by and he got arrested, and later taken to a hospital. Supposedly they sedated him for attacking a nurse and he's been speaking in baby-talk gibberish ever since. The kids at school say he can‚Äôt even feed himself anymore.

I actually found a photo album in the attic once. I assume most of the pictures included my dad because there were dark fuzzy spots where the photos refused to develop properly. One of the few you could actually see anything in was me as a baby. It was fairly close up, so all you could see was me sleeping in someone‚Äôs arms. The arms didn‚Äôt have any hair, so I thought they might be a woman‚Äôs. I guess it could have been a man who shaves their arms. The back had a handwritten note that just read, ‚Äútake care of your dad for me.‚Äù

So I guess that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. Not like I have anywhere else to go.

¬† RHEN  
  
¬† There is blood under my fingernails. I wonder how many of my people I‚Äôve killed this time.  
  
¬† I thrust my hands into the barrel beside the stables. The ice-cold water bites at my skin, but the blood clings. I shouldn‚Äôt bother, because it will all be gone in an hour anyway, but I hate this. The blood. The not knowing.  
  
¬† Hooves ring against the cobblestones somewhere behind me, followed by the jingle of a horse‚Äôs bridle.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt need to look. My guard commander always follows at a safe distance until the transition is complete.  
  
¬† Guard commander. As if Grey has men left to command.  
  
¬† As if he didn‚Äôt earn the title by default.  
  
¬† I swipe the water from my hands and turn. Grey stands a few yards back, holding the reins of Ironheart, the fastest horse in the stables. The animal is blowing hard, its chest and flanks damp with sweat despite the early-morning chill.  
  
¬† For as long as we‚Äôve been trapped here, Grey‚Äôs appearance is somehow a continual surprise. He looks as young as the day he earned a position in the elite Royal Guard, his dark hair slightly unkempt, his face unlined. His uniform still fits him well, every buckle and strap perfectly arranged, every weapon shining in the near darkness.  
  
¬† He once carried a gleam of eagerness in his eye, a spark for adventure. For challenge.  
  
¬† That gleam has long since gone dark, the only aspect of his appearance that is never remade by the curse.  
  
¬† I wonder if my unchanged appearance startles him, too.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù I say.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNone. All of your people are safe this time.‚Äù  
  
¬† This time. I should be relieved. I am not. My people will be at risk again soon enough. ‚ÄúAnd the girl?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGone. As always.‚Äù  
  
¬† I look back at the blood staining my hands, and a familiar tightness wraps around my rib cage. I turn back to the barrel and bury my hands in the water. It‚Äôs so cold it nearly steals my breath.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm covered in blood, Commander.‚Äù A lick of anger curls through my chest. ‚ÄúI killed something.‚Äù  
  
¬† As if sensing danger, his horse stomps and dances at the end of the reins. Grey puts out a hand to calm the animal.  
  
¬† Once there would have been a stablehand rushing to take his horse, especially upon hearing my tone. Once there was a castle full of courtiers and historians and advisers who would have turned over a coin for a bit of gossip about Prince Rhen, heir to the throne of Emberfall.  
  
¬† Once there was a royal family that would have frowned on my antics.  
  
¬† Now there is me, and there is Grey.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI left a trail of human blood on the path out of the forest,‚Äù he says, unaffected by my anger. He‚Äôs used to this. ‚ÄúThe horse led a good chase, until you fell on a herd of deer in the southernmost part of your lands. We stayed well away from the villages.‚Äù  
  
¬† That explains the condition of the animal. We traveled far tonight.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the horse,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúThe sun will be up soon.‚Äù  
  
¬† Grey hands over the reins. This final hour is always the hardest. Full of regret for my failure once again. As always, I just want to get this over with.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny special requests, my lord?‚Äù  
  
¬† In the beginning, I was frivolous enough to say yes. I‚Äôd specify blondes or brunettes. Big breasts, or long legs, or tiny waists. I‚Äôd wine them and woo them and when they did not love me, another was easily found. The first time, the curse had seemed like a game.  
  
¬† Find me one you like, Grey, I‚Äôd said, laughing, as if finding women for his prince was a privilege.  
  
¬† Then I changed, and the monster tore through the castle, leaving a bloodbath.  
  
¬† When the season began again, I had no family left. No servants. Only six guardsmen, two of whom were badly injured.  
  
¬† By the third season, I had one.  
  
¬† Grey is still waiting for a response. I meet his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, Commander. Anyone is fine.‚Äù I sigh and begin leading the horse toward the stables, but then stop and turn. ‚ÄúWhose blood made the trail?‚Äù  
  
¬† Grey raises an arm and draws his sleeve back. A long knife wound still bleeds down into his hand, a slow trickle of crimson.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd order him to bind it, but the wound will be gone in an hour, when the sun is fully up.  
  
¬† So will the blood on my hands and the sweat on the horse‚Äôs flanks. The cobblestones will be warm with early-fall sunlight, and my breath will no longer fog in the morning air.  
  
¬† The girl will be gone, and the season will begin again.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll be newly eighteen.  
  
¬† For the three hundred twenty-seventh time.  
  
¬† CHAPTER TWO  
  
¬† HARPER  
  
¬† Washington, DC, is so cold it should be illegal.  
  
¬† I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt, but the material is practically threadbare, and it doesn‚Äôt do much good. I hate being out here playing lookout, but my brother has the worse end of this job, so I try not to complain.  
  
¬† Somewhere down the street, a man shouts and a car horn blares. I bite back a shiver and suck more tightly into the shadows. I found an old tire iron near the curb earlier,  
and I twist my fingers against the rusted metal, but whoever it was seems far away.  
  
¬† A glance at the timer on Jake‚Äôs phone tells me he has another thirteen minutes. Thirteen minutes, and he‚Äôll be done, and we can go buy a cup of coffee.  
  
¬† We don‚Äôt really have money to spend, but Jake always needs time to unwind, and he says coffee helps. It ratchets me up so I can‚Äôt sleep, which means I don‚Äôt crash until four in the morning and then I miss school. I‚Äôve missed enough days of my senior year that it probably doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. I sure don‚Äôt have any friends who‚Äôll miss me.  
  
¬† So Jake and I will sit in a corner booth of the all-night diner, and his hands will tremble on the mug for a few minutes. Then he‚Äôll tell me what he had to do. It‚Äôs never good.  
  
¬† I had to threaten to break his arm. I twisted it up behind his back. I think I almost dislocated it. His kids were there. It was awful.  
  
¬† I had to punch him. Told him I was going to hit him until a tooth came loose. He found the money real quick.  
  
¬† This guy was a musician. I threatened to smash a finger.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt want to hear the ways he shakes them down for cash. My brother is tall and built like a linebacker, but he‚Äôs always been gentle and soft-spoken and kind. When Mom first got sick, when Dad got involved with Lawrence and his men, Jake would look out for me. He‚Äôd let me sleep in his room or sneak me out of the house for ice cream. That was when Dad was around, when Dad was the one getting threatened by Lawrence‚Äôs ‚Äúbill collectors,‚Äù the men who‚Äôd come to our door to reclaim the money Dad had borrowed.  
  
¬† Now Dad‚Äôs gone. And Jake‚Äôs playing ‚Äúbill collector‚Äù just to keep them off our backs.  
  
¬† Guilt twists my insides. If it were just me, I wouldn‚Äôt let him do it.  
  
¬† But it‚Äôs not just me. It‚Äôs Mom, too.  
  
¬† Jake thinks he could do more for Lawrence. Buy us more time. But that would mean actually doing the things he‚Äôs only threatening to do. It would mean truly hurting people.  
  
¬† It would break him. I can already see how even this is changing him. Sometimes I wish he‚Äôd drink his coffee in silence.  
  
¬† I told him that once, and he got mad. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs hard to listen? I have to do it.‚Äù His voice was tight and hard and almost broke. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky, Harper. You‚Äôre lucky you just have to hear about it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Yeah. I feel super lucky.  
  
¬† But then I felt selfish, because he‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm not quick, and I‚Äôm not strong. Playing lookout is the only way he‚Äôll let me help. So now, when he needs to talk about these near-atrocities, I keep my mouth shut. I can‚Äôt fight, but I can listen.  
  
¬† I glance at the phone. Twelve minutes. If his time runs out, it means the job went bad, and I‚Äôm supposed to run. To get Mom out. To hide.  
  
¬† We‚Äôve gotten down to three minutes before. Two minutes. But he always appears, breathing hard and sometimes speckled with blood.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not worried yet.  
  
¬† Rust flakes under my fingertips as I twist the ice-cold tire iron in my hand. Sunrise isn‚Äôt far off, but I‚Äôll probably be too frozen by then to even notice.  
  
¬† A light feminine laugh carries in the air nearby, and I peek from the doorway. Two people stand alone by the corner, just at the edge of the circle of light cast by the streetlamp. The girl‚Äôs hair shines like a shampoo commercial, swinging as she staggers a little. The bars all closed at three a.m., but she clearly didn‚Äôt stop. Her micro-mini and open denim jacket make my sweatshirt feel like a parka.  
  
¬† The man is more suitably dressed, in dark clothes, with a long coat. I‚Äôm trying to decide if this is a cop busting a hooker or a john picking up a date, when the guy turns his head. I duck back into the doorway.  
  
¬† Her laughter rings through the street again. Either he‚Äôs hilarious or this girl is hammered.  
  
¬† The laugh cuts short with a gasp. Like someone yanked a plug.  
  
¬† I hold my breath. The silence is sudden and absolute.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt risk looking.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt risk not looking.  
  
¬† Jake would be so pissed. I have one job here. I imagine him yelling. Don‚Äôt get involved, Harper! You‚Äôre already vulnerable!  
  
¬† He‚Äôs right, but cerebral palsy doesn‚Äôt mean my curiosity is broken. I peek out around the edge of the doorway.  
  
¬† The blonde has collapsed in the man‚Äôs arms like a marionette, her head flopped to the side. His arm is hooked under her knees, and he keeps glancing up and down the street.  
  
¬† Jake will lose his mind if I call the cops. It‚Äôs not like what he‚Äôs doing is legal. If the police come around, Jake is at risk. I‚Äôm at risk. Mom‚Äôs at risk.  
  
¬† I keep staring at that waving blond hair, at the limp arm dragging the ground. He could be a trafficker. She could be dead‚Äîor close. I can‚Äôt do nothing.  
  
¬† I slip out of my sneakers so my stupid left foot won‚Äôt make a dragging noise against the pavement. I can move quickly when I want to, but quiet is tough to master. I rush forward and raise the bar.  
  
¬† He turns at the last second, which probably saves his life. The bar comes down across his shoulders instead of his head. He grunts and stumbles forward. The girl goes sprawling onto the pavement.  
  
¬† I raise the bar to hit him again, but the man retaliates faster than I‚Äôm ready for. He blocks my swing and drives an elbow into my chest, hooking my ankle with his own. I‚Äôm falling before I realize it. My body slams into the concrete.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs suddenly right there, almost on top of me. I start swinging. I can‚Äôt reach his head, but I catch him across the hip. Then his ribs.  
  
¬† He seizes my wrist, then smacks my arm down to the pavement. I squeal and twist away from him, but it feels like he‚Äôs kneeling on my right thigh. His free arm pins my chest. It hurts. A lot.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRelease the weapon.‚Äù He‚Äôs got an accent, but I can‚Äôt place it. And now that his face is on top of mine, I realize he‚Äôs young, not much older than Jake.  
  
¬† I clench my fingers even tighter around the bar. My breath makes huge panicked clouds between us. I beat at him with my free hand, but I might as well be striking a statue. He tightens his hold on my wrist, until I genuinely think the bones are rubbing together.  
  
¬† A whimper escapes my throat, but I grit my teeth and hold on.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRelease it,‚Äù he says again, his tone thickening with anger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJake!‚Äù I scream, hoping enough time has passed that he might be heading back. The pavement stabs daggers of ice into my back. Every muscle hurts, but I keep fighting. ‚ÄúJake! Someone help me!‚Äù  
  
¬† I try to claw at his eyes, but the man‚Äôs grip tightens in response. His gaze meets mine and there‚Äôs no hesitation there. My wrist is going to break.  
  
¬† A siren kicks up somewhere nearby, but it‚Äôll be too late. I try to claw at his face again, but I catch his neck instead. Blood blossoms under my nails, and his eyes turn murderous. The sky lightens fractionally behind him, turning pink with streaks of orange.  
  
¬† His free hand lifts and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to hit me or strangle me or break my neck. It doesn‚Äôt matter. This is it. My last sight will be a glorious sunrise.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm wrong. His hand never strikes.  
  
¬† Instead, the sky disappears altogether.  
  
¬† CHAPTER THREE  
  
¬† RHEN  
  
¬† Sunlight gilds the fixtures in my sitting room, throwing shadows along the hand-sewn tapestries and the velvet chairs my parents once occupied. Sometimes, if I sit here long enough, I can imagine their presence. I can hear my father‚Äôs brusque voice, full of admonishment and lectures. My mother‚Äôs quiet disapproval.  
  
¬† I can remember my own arrogance.  
  
¬† I want to walk out of the castle and fling myself off a cliff.  
  
¬† That doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried. More than once.  
  
¬† I always wake here, in this room, waiting in the sunlight. The fire always burns low, just as it is now, the flames crackling in a familiar pattern. The stone floor appears freshly swept, wine and goblets sitting ready on a side table. Grey‚Äôs weapons hang on the opposite chair, waiting for his return.  
  
¬† Everything is always the same.  
  
¬† Except for the dead. They never come back.  
  
&nb  
sp; The fire pops, a bit of kindling sliding to the base of the fireplace. Right on schedule. Grey will reappear soon.  
  
¬† I sigh. Practiced words wait on my tongue, though sometimes it takes the girls a while to awaken from the sleeping ether Grey gives them. They‚Äôre always frightened at first, but I‚Äôve learned how to ease their fears, to charm and coax them into trusting me.  
  
¬† Only to destroy that trust when autumn slides into winter. When they see me change.  
  
¬† The air flickers, and I straighten. As much as I hate the curse, the never-ending repetition of my life here, the girls are the one spot of change. Despite myself, I‚Äôm curious to see what motionless beauty will hang in Grey‚Äôs arms today.  
  
¬† But when Grey appears, he‚Äôs pinning a girl to the floor.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs not a motionless beauty. She‚Äôs scrawny and shoeless and digging her nails into the side of his neck.  
  
¬† Grey swears and knocks her hand away. Blood appears in lines across his throat.  
  
¬† I rise from the chair, nearly losing a moment to the sheer novelty of it all. ‚ÄúCommander! Release her.‚Äù  
  
¬† He flings himself back and finds his feet. The girl scrambles away from him, clutching a rusted weapon of some sort. Her movement is labored and clumsy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù She gets a hand on the wall and staggers to her feet. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù  
  
¬† Grey grabs his sword from the chair, pulling it free from the scabbard with a fierceness I haven‚Äôt seen in ‚Ä¶ in ages. ‚ÄúHave no worries, my lord. This may be the shortest season yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† The girl raises the rusted bar as if that will provide any kind of defense against a trained swordsman. Dark curls spill out of the hood of her clothing, and her face is tired, drawn, and dusty. I wonder if Grey injured her, the way she keeps her weight off her left leg.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTry it.‚Äù She glances between him and me. ‚ÄúI know a good spot I haven‚Äôt hit with this yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù Grey lifts his weapon and steps forward. ‚ÄúI know a good spot I haven‚Äôt hit with this yet.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù I‚Äôve never seen Grey go after one of the girls, but when he shows no intention of stopping, I sharpen my tone. ‚ÄúThat is an order, Commander.

¬† He stops, but his sword remains in his hand and he doesn‚Äôt take his eyes off the girl. ‚ÄúDo not think,‚Äù he tells her, his voice fierce, ‚Äúthat this means I will allow you to attack me again.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she snaps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get another chance.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe attacked you?‚Äù My eyebrows rise. ‚ÄúGrey. She is half your size.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe makes up for it in temperament. She most assuredly was not my first choice.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù The girl‚Äôs eyes keep flicking from me to him to the sword in his hand‚Äîand then to the doorway behind us. Her knuckles are white where they grip the bar. ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù  
  
¬† I glance at Grey and lower my voice. ‚ÄúPut up your sword. You‚Äôre frightening her.‚Äù  
  
¬† The Royal Guard is trained to obey without hesitation and Grey is no exception. He slides his weapon into its sheath, but strings the sword belt around his waist.  
  
¬† I cannot remember the last time he was fully armed on the first day of the season. Probably not since there were men to command and threats to deflect.  
  
¬† But removing the weapon has drained some of the tension from the room. I put out a hand and keep my voice gentle, the way I speak to skittish horses in the stables. ‚ÄúYou are safe here. May I have your weapon?‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes slide to Grey, to where his hand remains on the hilt of his sword. ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou fear Grey? Easily solved.‚Äù I look at him. ‚ÄúCommander. You are ordered to not harm this girl.‚Äù  
  
¬† He takes a step back and folds his arms.  
  
¬† The girl watches this exchange and then she draws a long breath and takes a tentative step forward, the bar held in front of her.  
  
¬† At least she can be tamed as easily as the others. I extend my hand and give her an encouraging look.  
  
¬† She takes another step‚Äîbut then her expression shifts, her eyes darken, and she swings.  
  
¬† Hard steel slams into my waist, just below my rib cage. Silver hell, it hurts. I double over and barely have time to react before she‚Äôs swinging for my head.  
  
¬† Luckily, my training is nearly as thorough as Grey‚Äôs. I duck and catch the bar before she makes contact.  
  
¬† Now I understand why Grey grabbed his sword.  
  
¬† Her eyes flare, burning with defiance. I jerk her forward, ready to wrestle the bar out of her grasp.  
  
¬† Instead, she lets go, forcing me to fall back. She stumbles toward the door, limping into the hallway, her breathing ragged.  
  
¬† I let her go. The iron bar drops to the carpet and I press a hand to my side.  
  
¬† Grey hasn‚Äôt moved. He‚Äôs standing there, arms folded. ‚ÄúDo you still wish for me to leave her unharmed?‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a time when he wouldn‚Äôt have dared to question me.  
  
¬† There was a time when I might have cared.  
  
¬† I sigh, then wince as my lungs expand into the already-forming bruise on my side. What began as a novelty now simply hurts. If she fights to run so fiercely now, there is little hope for later.  
  
¬† The shadows have shifted a bit, tracing their familiar path. I‚Äôve watched it hundreds of times.  
  
¬† When this season ends in failure, I‚Äôll watch it again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe is injured,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúShe cannot get far.‚Äù  
  
¬† He is right. I am wasting time.  
  
¬† As if I don‚Äôt have time in spades.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúBring her back.‚Äù  
  
¬† CHAPTER FOUR  
  
¬† HARPER  
  
¬† I‚Äôm running down a long hallway, my breath roaring in my ears. This has to be a museum or some kind of historical building. My socks fight to grip the velvet carpeting that lines the marble floor. Wood paneling covers the walls, with stone masonry climbing to a ceiling that arches high above. Heavy wooden doors with wrought-iron handles sit at uneven intervals along the hallway, but none are open.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt stop to try any. I just run. I need to find another person or get out of here.  
  
¬† As I round a curve in the hallway, I‚Äôm met by a massive, sweeping, sunlit staircase that descends into a grand entranceway. The space is the size of my high school gymnasium, with a dark slate floor, massive stained glass windows, and a pair of iron doors. Tapestries hang from the walls, threaded with purples and greens and reds, shot through with strands of gold and silver that sparkle in the light. Tables sit along the side, laid out with cakes and pastries and dozens of champagne glasses. Half a dozen gilded white chairs wait in the corner, musical instruments sitting ready.  
  
¬† The place looks prepped for a wedding. Or a party. But definitely not a kidnapping.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm so confused‚Äîbut at least I‚Äôve found a door.  
  
¬† A sudden beeping pierces the silence.  
  
¬† Jake‚Äôs timer.  
  
¬† I dig the phone out of my pocket, staring at the flashing zeroes. My throat closes up. I don‚Äôt know if he made it out.  
  
¬† I need to get myself together. I‚Äôm standing in the open and tears won‚Äôt give me anything but a wet face. Once I find somewhere safe, I can call 911.  
  
¬† I grip the banister and rush down the steps. My left leg is clumsy and about to give way, but I mentally threaten to cut it off if it doesn‚Äôt get me out of here. It listens.  
  
¬† As I pass the corner, the instruments lift from the chairs in unison.  
  
¬† I startle and duck right, ready for one to come flying at me‚Äîbut then, without warning, the instruments begin to play. Symphonic music fills the hall, a rich song filled with flutes and trumpets and violins.  
  
¬† This has to be a trick. An optical illusion. Like at a theme park, somehow triggered by my motion.  
  
¬† I reach out and grab a flute, expecting it to be fixed in place with thin wires or subtle plastic.  
  
¬† But it‚Äôs not. My hand closes on the metal like I‚Äôm picking it up from a shelf. The steel is vibrating as if someone is playing. There‚Äôs no weight to it‚Äîno batteries. No speaker. Nothing.  
  
¬† When I move it close to my ear, the sound is coming from inside the tube.  
  
¬† I take a step back and fling it away from me.  
  
¬† The flute snaps right back into place, levitating above the chair as though an invisible musician stood there holding it. The keys depress and release.  
  
¬† I swallow hard. This is a dream. I‚Äôm drugged. Something.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm wasting time. I need to get out of here.  
  
¬† I hurry for the door, prepared for it to be locked‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not. I stumble out onto a marble platform, and warm air swirls around me. Stone walls stretch to either side, and steps lead down to a cobblestone path. Acres of trimmed grass stretch as far as I can see, dappled by randomly spaced trees. Flower beds. A massive fountain spraying water into the air. In the distance is a dense forest, thick with vibrant greenery.  
  
¬† No paved road that I can see.  
  
¬† The door swings closed behind me, clanking into place, choking the music into silence. There‚Äôs no railing here, so I ease down the steps and onto the cobblestones. The building towers over me, large cream-colored bricks spaced by blocks of marble and stone.  
  
¬† This isn‚Äôt a museum. It‚Äôs a castle. A big one.  
  
¬† And still, no people. No one anywhere‚Äîand I can see for acres. The silence is all-consuming. No cars. No buzzing power lines. No airplanes.  
  
¬† I jerk the phone out of my pocket and start punching in the numbers 911.  
  
¬† The phone beeps at me in protest. No service.  
  
¬† I shake it, like that‚Äôs somehow going to help. Everything across the top is grayed out.  
  
¬† No cell towers. No Wi-Fi. No Bluetooth.  
  
¬† A whimper escapes my chest.  
  
¬† Those instruments were playing themselves.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt reason that out. It‚Äôs too tangled up with my very real worry for my brother.  
  
¬† A new thought hits me, piling more worry on top. If something happened to Jake, no one is there to help Mom. I imagine her lying in bed, coughing wetly from the cancer that crowds her lungs. Needing food. Medicine. Needing someone to bring her to the bathroom.  
  
¬† Without warning, my eyes blur. I swipe at my cheeks and force my legs to run. Sweat collects inside my sweatshirt.  
  
¬† Wait. Sweat. It‚Äôs warm.  
  
¬† It was free  
zing in DC.  
  
¬† All that sweat goes cold.  
  
¬† Panic later. I need to move.  
  
¬† A large outbuilding sits directly behind the castle, just beyond a sprawling courtyard lined with more cobblestones. Flowers bloom everywhere, spilling down wooden trellises, bursting from massive planters, blooming along hedges and in gardens. Still no people.  
  
¬† My muscles are tight and fatigued, and sweat runs a line down the side of my face. I pray for this to be some kind of garage, because I‚Äôm going to need an alternate form of transportation soon. I can‚Äôt keep running forever. I flatten against the far wall of the castle, breathing hard, waiting. Listening.  
  
¬† When I hear nothing, I head for the building across the courtyard, my left foot dragging and begging for a break. I stumble through the doorway, slipping a little in my damp socks.  
  
¬† Three horses throw up their heads and snort.  
  
¬† Oh wow. Not a garage. A stable.  
  
¬† This is almost better. I don‚Äôt know how to hot-wire a car, but I do know how to ride.  
  
¬† Back before our lives fell apart, when Dad had a job and a reputation, I rode horses. It had started as a therapeutic activity after all the cerebral palsy‚Äìrelated surgeries‚Äîbut it turned into a passion. A freedom, as equine legs lent me strength and power. I worked at the stables in exchange for riding time for years, until we needed to move to the city.  
  
¬† Of everything we‚Äôve had to give up, I miss the horses the most.  
  
¬† Thirty stalls flank each side of the aisle, made of richly stained boards leading halfway to the ceiling, topped with iron bars. Well-kept horses gleam in the sunlight that creeps through the skylights. Bridles hang at regular intervals along the wall, their bits and buckles sparkling, the leather carrying a rich shine. No wisps of hay lie in the aisle, no swarming flies collect on spilled grain. Every inch of these stables is perfection.  
  
¬† A buckskin stretches out his nose to blow puffs at my hand. He‚Äôs tied to a ring inside his stall, and he‚Äôs already saddled. He didn‚Äôt jump when I came sliding into the aisle, and even now regards me calmly. He‚Äôs big and solid, with a tan-colored coat and a black mane and tail. A hammered gold sign on the front of his stall reads Ironwill.  
  
¬† I run a hand down the buckskin‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just call you Will.‚Äù  
  
¬† A small closet beside his stall door houses boots and cloaks‚Äîand a dagger strung along a belt.  
  
¬† A real weapon. Yes.  
  
¬† I loop it around my waist and cinch it tight. The boots are too big, but they lace up my calves almost to my knees, giving my ankles some extra support.  
  
¬† I ease into the stall and bolt the door closed behind me. Will accepts a bridle readily, despite my shaking hands jerking at his mouth when I have to tighten the buckles.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I whisper, stroking him on the cheek. ‚ÄúOut of practice.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then I hear the footstep, the rough rasp of a boot on stone.  
  
¬† I freeze‚Äîthen duck to the far side of the horse, dragging him into a shadowed corner of the stall. His reins have gone slick in my palm, but I keep a tight hold so he blocks me here.  
  
¬† Someone clucks to each horse, making his way through the stables. A soft word, a pat on the neck. Another pause, then more footsteps.  
  
¬† Whoever it is, he‚Äôs checking the stalls.  
  
¬† A wooden shelf runs along the side of the stall, probably for hay or feed. I fold my body onto it, then shimmy up and get to my hands and knees. It‚Äôs an awkward position for mounting, but there‚Äôs no way I can do it from the ground. I have to concentrate to maneuver my foot into the stirrup. Sweat courses down my back now, but I grab hold of the saddle.  
  
¬† It takes everything I have not to whimper. This is the world‚Äôs most patient animal, because he stands absolutely still as I haul myself onto his back.  
  
¬† But I‚Äôm up here. I‚Äôm on.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm so exhausted I‚Äôm ready to cry. No, I am crying. Silent tears roll down my cheeks. I have to get out of here. I have to.  
  
¬† Footsteps, then a soft gasp of surprise. The bolt is thrown. I catch a glimpse of dark hair and see a flash of steel as the man draws a sword. The stall door begins to swing open.  
  
¬† I slam my heels into Will‚Äôs flanks, screaming in rage for good measure. The horse is terrified‚Äîwith reason. I‚Äôm terrifying myself. But he springs forward, slamming the door wide, knocking the armed man out of the way.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù I cry. ‚ÄúPlease, Will! Go!‚Äù I dig my heels into his sides.  
  
¬† Will leaps across the aisle, finds purchase, and bolts.  
  
¬† Tears blur my vision, but sight won‚Äôt help me stay on. I‚Äôve lost both stirrups already, and we‚Äôre careening over cobblestones. The fingers of my left hand tangle in Will‚Äôs mane, and my other hand has wrapped around his neck. When we hit the grass, the horse is like a pumping oil rig, slamming me up and down with each stride.  
  
¬† A sharp whistle cuts the air behind me, three short chirps of sound.  
  
¬† Will digs in his hooves, skids to a stop, and whirls. I don‚Äôt have a chance. I go flying over his shoulder and crash into the turf.  
  
¬† For a moment, I don‚Äôt know which way is up. My head spins.  
  
¬† So close. So close.  
  
¬† Those men are coming after me. They‚Äôre a blur in the sunlight, whether from tears or a head injury. I need to get to my feet. I need to run.  
  
¬† I manage to get myself upright, but my legs don‚Äôt want to work quickly. The blond man is already there, reaching to grab me. The dark-haired swordsman is just behind him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù A small sound squeaks free of my chest. I stagger away from him and draw the dagger.  
  
¬† The swordsman begins to pull his weapon.  
  
¬† I backpedal farther, trip over my own feet, and sit down hard in the grass.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCommander. Stop,‚Äù the blond man says. He puts his hands up. ‚ÄúBe at ease. I will not harm you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou chased me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what we do to horse thieves,‚Äù the swordsman says.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGrey.‚Äù The blond man cuts a sharp look his way, then extends a hand to me. ‚ÄúPlease. You have nothing to fear.‚Äù  
  
¬† He must be kidding.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt get a good look at him before, but I do now. His profile is striking, with high cheekbones and an angular jaw. Rich brown eyes. No freckles, but enough time in the sun to stop anyone from describing him as pale. He wears a white shirt under a high-collared blue jacket accented with leather trim and detailed gold stitching. Gold buckles cross his chest and a dagger is belted to his hip.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs staring down at me as if he faces half-crazed girls all the time.  
  
¬† I keep my dagger brandished in front of me. ‚ÄúTell me where I am.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou are on the grounds of Ironrose Castle, in the heart of Emberfall.‚Äù  
  
¬† I rack my brain, trying to think of any attractions with those names that could be reasonably close to DC. This castle is huge. I would have heard of it. And Jake‚Äôs ticking timer is the one puzzle piece that refuses to fit. There is literally nowhere the swordsman could have taken me so quickly. I wet my lips. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the closest city?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSilvermoon Harbor.‚Äù He hesitates, then steps closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre confused. Please‚Äîallow me to help you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I thrust the dagger up at him and he stops. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting out of here. I‚Äôm going home.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou cannot find your way home from here.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glare at the armed man behind him. ‚ÄúHe got me here. There has to be a way back.‚Äù  
  
¬† The swordsman‚Äôs expression is inscrutable, lacking any of the charm of the man in front of me. ‚ÄúThere is not.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glare up at him. ‚ÄúThere has to be.‚Äù  
  
¬† His face does not change. ‚ÄúThere. Is. Not.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù The blond man extends a hand again. ‚ÄúWe will not argue this point in the courtyard. Come. I will show you to a room. Are you hungry?‚Äù  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt decide if they‚Äôre crazy‚Äîor if I am. I adjust my grip on the dagger. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere with you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI understand your reluctance, but I cannot allow you to leave the castle grounds. It is unsafe. I have no soldiers to patrol the King‚Äôs Highway.‚Äù  
  
&n  
bsp; ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Highway,‚Äù I repeat numbly. Everything he says sounds so logical. Not like he‚Äôs trying to cajole me into following him. More like he‚Äôs surprised I would consider anything else.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt make sense of any of this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he says more gently. ‚ÄúSurely you know we could take you by force.‚Äù  
  
¬† My heart skips a beat in my chest. I do know that. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse‚Äîbeing taken by force, or going willingly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you threaten me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThreaten you?‚Äù His eyebrows go up. ‚ÄúYou think I intend to threaten you by offering safety and comfort and food?‚Äù  
  
¬† He sounds offended. I know men who take what they want. They don‚Äôt act like this.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt know where I am, but my body already hurts. I‚Äôm not entirely sure I can get off the ground unaided. I definitely can‚Äôt run again.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs right: they could take me by force. I should conserve my energy.  
  
¬† I can rest. I can eat. I‚Äôll find a way out.  
  
¬† I hold my breath and slide the dagger into its sheath. I expect the men to protest my keeping the weapon, but they don‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Despite my determination, this feels like giving up. I wonder what Jake would say.  
  
¬† Oh, Jake. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt know what to do.  
  
¬† I can survive this. I have to.  
  
¬† So I grit my teeth, lock down my emotions, and reach up to take his hand.  
  
¬† CHAPTER FIVE  
  
¬† RHEN  
  
¬† After we return Ironwill to the stables, the girl walks quietly beside me, her gait uneven enough to tell me she‚Äôs truly injured. She‚Äôs keeping her distance from both me and Grey, her arms wrapped tightly around her abdomen, one hand resting on the hilt of her dagger.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm impressed that she found a weapon‚Äîand more so that she went for the stables as a means of escape. Most of the girls Grey drags from her world won‚Äôt touch a blade or a bridle, and instead gravitate to the finery found within the lushly outfitted wardrobes inside Ironrose Castle. This early in the season, the other girls would sit by the hearth and gaze at me over crystal goblets, while I‚Äôd pour wine and tell stories with just enough devilishness to make them blush.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The house smelled like rust and burned coffee. I spent the rest of the night cleaning what was left, wiping the streaks of blood that had sprayed across the walls and floor. Every stain seemed to sink deeper the harder I scrubbed, darkening the wood instead of coming up.

When I poured the bucket out in the sink, the water looked wrong‚Äîthicker somehow, with a film that shimmered like oil.

I didn‚Äôt call anyone. I didn‚Äôt even think to. What would I have said‚Äîthat something from a television bled out onto my floor and died screaming?

They would‚Äôve sent a wellness check, maybe a padded van. No, I just wanted silence. To make everything still again. To make it mine.

But the silence didn‚Äôt feel still anymore. The floor creaked where it hadn‚Äôt before, the boards subtly slanted beneath my feet.

When I tried to hang the kitchen clock back up, it wouldn‚Äôt stay straight. I fixed it three times before realizing the wall itself had bowed slightly outward, just enough that the plaster looked warped in the light.

By morning, my arm had swollen where the glass had caught me. The skin was red, then pale, then something else entirely‚Äîtoo smooth, too stretched.

When I pressed it, it didn‚Äôt feel like flesh anymore but something dense beneath the surface, like a cable under tension. It pulsed against my thumb once, slow and deliberate, as if whatever ran through it wasn‚Äôt blood.

I wrapped it in gauze and pretended it didn‚Äôt hurt. Pretended it didn‚Äôt move. Because I‚Äôd seen it do that, just once‚Äîwhen I leaned over the sink, the reflection caught the edge of my bandage.

The cloth twitched. Not a trick of the pulse or pain, but a deliberate, tiny flex. Like it was testing itself.

By afternoon, the gauze was damp again. I thought it was blood until I unwrapped it. The skin underneath had gone colorless, gray around the edges, and the veins had darkened to something near black.

But they didn‚Äôt run in the same direction anymore. They zigzagged, crossing under the skin at sharp angles, splitting and reconnecting in patterns that didn‚Äôt make sense.

I could trace them with my fingertip‚Äîthin crooked lines, uneven as if drawn by a shaking hand. When I touched one near my wrist, it twitched, then shifted slightly to avoid me.

It slid out of place, burrowing deeper. The movement was subtle but alive, and I almost screamed.

I threw the bandage away and scrubbed the wound until it bled again, thinking maybe I could wash out whatever infection this was. But the blood came slow, syrup-thick, darker than it should‚Äôve been.

It had a smell too, faintly metallic but wrong, like wet copper left out too long.

When I finally looked up, my reflection was waiting for me in the mirror. The steam had cleared halfway, leaving the image split‚Äîhalf fog, half clarity.

My left arm didn‚Äôt match my right. The muscles didn‚Äôt line up correctly anymore; the bend of my elbow was slightly higher, the wrist joint angled inward.

It wasn‚Äôt dramatic, just‚Ä¶ off. Enough to make me dizzy if I stared too long.

That night, I tried to sleep, but the house wouldn‚Äôt stop breathing. The walls flexed with every gust of wind, sighing through the cracks.

The pipes hummed with something slow and rhythmic. It wasn‚Äôt the plumbing. It was a heartbeat.

When I woke, the wound had sealed itself entirely. No blood, no scab. Just smooth, grayish skin.

I couldn‚Äôt even find where the cut had been‚Äîexcept for one thing. When I clenched my fist, the joints didn‚Äôt all move the same way.

My ring finger bent slightly backward, just enough to catch the light wrong.

It didn‚Äôt hurt. That was the worst part. It didn‚Äôt feel broken.

It felt like it wanted to bend that way.

was mild. didn't go on any meds so its REALLY mild.

2 weeks ago i noticed 2 small scabs, a few inches apart on my abdomen. Very weird... also small...i tried to replicate such a scab and couldn't.

a few days ago I noticed another such pair of red spots... very small, seemed to have some coloration around it(i cant post a pic can ?). Same side, abdomen stomach area, same distance roughly.

Very very weird. I live with my familly.

Also... 2 weeks ago i got more religious? then it stopped out of the blue either this week or last week and recently again i got more religious, back to praying at least once a day. (not hyperreligious since I had moments like that as a kid).

and I keep looking at it, i found a pic of injection marks online and it looked simmilar. Small red area.

The scabs are suspicious. I made a couple reddit posts and nobody replied. I randomly get better for 0 reason maybe just avoiding sugar and coffee? I was paranoid about drugs in the sugar... saw something weird. Somehow extra sugary foods from the store don't affect me the way our sugar does. Kept eating it though cause I told myself I was paranoid.

Honestly? maybe im just in denial about this all. Felt an entity go into my mind again, realized that yeah maybe the spots were paranoia and it actually was some entity but it cant be both can it?

i dont actually do drugs though. I, also, should be having withdrawl symptoms upon quitting using the sugar at home. (maybe i didnt quit long enough).

Either way something is wrong lol. Realized for a bit after that entity that I was supposed to go somewhere... then the next day i felt fine. Cried for a couple hours though(why does this keep happening)  
Why do i randomly snap out of it too

Someone I can eventually get to know in person. Maybe we can go to an arcade, it's been a long time since I have gone to an arcade. I‚Äôm single, and if things work out, I‚Äôd be open to a relationship.

I‚Äôm an Armenian-American guy who loves great food, music, and good company. I‚Äôm a foodie, a Shiba Inu enthusiast, and a Yankees fan. I love penguins, I have penguins on my coffee mug but I picked the Shiba calendar over the yearly penguin calendar. 

I like comedy and action, TV shows and movies. I also enjoy playing video games and watching anime in my free time, mostly listening to LitRPG audio books.¬† I enjoy a vast variety of music especially City Pop, Classic Rock, Irish Punk, Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Buffet, Viza and Reggae. Three of my favorite movies are Kung Fu Hustle, Blazing Saddles, and The Blues Brothers.

 Most of my video games are single-player, but I‚Äôm open to trying multiplayer if you‚Äôre on Steam, especially if you're into fallout 76.
  
Some video games I like: Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Yakuza 0, GTA Vice City, Sleeping Dogs, Fallout 76.

¬† My name is Tina  
  
¬† Rawr Raaawr.  
  
¬† Damn, forgot to replace the batteries on the doorbell sensor again, I think  
  
¬† Now, instead of the regular Ding Dong most doorbells have mine sounds like a cat in heat.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood Morning, Ladies. ‚Äù I smile and look over to greet my first customers of the day. ‚ÄúMy name is Tina. If you need any help with anything, just holler. ‚Äù  
  
¬† When I see them smile and nod back at me I go to my table of sweaters which have become a bit of a mess from the day before and commence re-folding.  
  
¬† Most people wouldn‚Äôt do this with a huge smile on their face but, what can I say?  
  
¬† I take pride in my work.  
  
¬† Rawr Raaawr.  
  
¬† I start speaking cheerfully before I see who comes through the door, ‚ÄúGood Morn‚Ä¶Oh, it‚Äôs just you! How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù  
  
¬† I see my not so cheerful worker girl Mimi walk through the studio and straight to the staff room without so much as a nod.  
  
¬† Ooookay then.  
  
¬† This is not unusual for Mimi. She is super surly in the best way. You can ask her anything, anything at all and she‚Äôll only give you a straight answer. Everyone needs a friend like her.  
  
¬† She emerges from the staff room, walks across the studio and straight out the door again.  
  
¬† I see her turn left and smile to myself. I know she‚Äôll only be a few minutes but will come back with the best Good Morning greeting anyone can get.  
  
¬† Re-commence sweater folding.  
  
¬† Five minutes later I hear the god awful doorbell again and Mimi walks over to me carrying the elixir of life in her dainty hands. I take the cup from her and sip.  
  
¬† Mmmmmm, Caramel Latte. I love you, Meems.  
  
¬† She takes her place behind the counter and logs into the register.  
  
¬† She looks over at me and asks, ‚ÄúWhat are you smiling at, Atomic?‚Äù Surly as ever.  
  
¬† She calls me Atomic because of my surname. I laugh and shake my head at her. I see her lip twitch as she looks over her day‚Äôs to-do list.  
  
¬† I guess I should introduce myself. My name is Tina Tomic. Actually, my name is Valentina Tomic. But the only time I ever get called Valentina is when I‚Äôm in trouble.  
  
¬† I manage Safira Boutique. Actually, scratch that, I own Safira Boutique. None of my workers know this. They all believe I‚Äôm the store manager because this is what I have led them to believe. Safira Boutique is my pride and joy.  
  
¬† I bought it two years ago. The building was in pretty good shape but I put some money into renovating. I made all the fixings more modern and added a small kitchenette in the back which holds a fridge, microwave, small two-burner stove, and a sink to wash our dirty dishes. I also had new signs put up and a brand spanking new front counter put in. It‚Äôs very modern, shiny black with a high back; this hides our register and computer. There is also a super tiny change room at the back of the store. The store room was in good condition but the overall wiring needed to be re-done. This cost me a packet, but it was totally worth it.  
  
¬† Safira‚Äôs is a narrow building but is long; it looks small from the front but is surprisingly deceptive.  
  
¬† I had it repainted a deep blue color because Safira means Sapphire in Croatian which is my ethnic background.  
  
¬† The store front window holds two mannequins; I change their outfits every week.  
  
¬† I love doing this.  
  
¬† We carry many types of clothing items for several occasions. Clubbing and party clothes, cocktail dresses, formal occasion wear, sexy sleepwear (ooh la la), and a crap load of accessories. Our accessories are our main seller. We have clutches, necklaces, bracelets, bangles, costume jewellery, rings, and hair accessories. The reason these are our main seller is because they don‚Äôt cost a lot, so after school hours we are packed with high school and college girls who, unfortunately, can‚Äôt afford our clothing but go nuts over the affordable things.  
  
¬† I love my job.  
  
¬† Safira has three workers; myself, Mimi, and Lola. I work full time, 9 to 5. Mimi and Lola get three to four shifts a week depending on how busy we are. We‚Äôll soon add a fourth to our trio.  
  
¬† My BFF Natalie is coming to live in New York!  
  
¬† Excited, you ask?!  
  
¬† Who, me?  
  
¬† Noooooo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm freaking ecstatic!  
  
¬† Although born and raised in California, I moved to New York two years ago. Natalie has been my best friend pretty much all my life. So when I moved away, it broke both our hearts. I had my reasons for moving. She understood why I left Cali but declared she couldn‚Äôt live without me because she says ‚ÄúCali sucks without you‚Äù.  
  
¬† So, this week I‚Äôll have a moving truck arrive at my apartment. I‚Äôll pack the second bedroom full of her stuff and next week my BFF will not only be living with me but also working with me.  
  
¬† Totally awesome, if you ask me.  
  
¬† Mimi interrupts my thought by nudging me. ‚ÄúThere he is again. Damn, that boy is fine. And I mean fine with a capital F. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I look through the shop window, past the mannequins and my heart stutters. This is not the first time I‚Äôve noticed him. And Mimi is right.  
  
¬† He is fine.  
  
¬† Super fine.  
  
¬† So fine he should be on a billboard or a book cover somewhere. But something about him bothers me.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Two weeks earlier‚Ä¶  
  
¬† Great. Just great.  
  
¬† A traffic jam and I have approximately six minutes to open the store. No way am I going to get there on time and this ticks me off. I open the store at nine a. m. and pretty often there are already customers waiting for me.  
  
¬† Ten minutes later I have my car parked at a public parking spot because I can never get a space by my store and I don‚Äôt have parking spaces under or behind the building. I‚Äôve tried taking the bus a few times but found I value my sleep too much to get up an hour earlier than I have to if I take my car.  
  
¬† Four customers are waiting on me. Three of them are smiling when they see me running towards them. One of them is scowling at me and it makes her pretty face oh-so ugly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI am so sorry. There is a traffic jam down the street and I was stuck. I hope you haven‚Äôt been waiting long. ‚Äù I unlock the door and they follow me inside.  
  
¬† I open the staff room door, literally throw my bag onto the kitchenette counter, and run back to the register to log on.  
  
¬† The scowling woman is waiting for me.  
  
¬† I smile and say, ‚ÄúGood Morning. My name is Tina. How can I help you today?‚Äù  
  
¬† She flicks her nails at a garment on the counter and replies, ‚ÄúThis dress is awful. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She has a great Jersey accent.  
  
¬† My smile falters and I respond, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry you don‚Äôt like it. ‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to be sympathetic but it‚Äôs kind of hard when she‚Äôs looking at me like I forced her to buy it.  
  
¬† Her elbow is resting on the counter, she looks closely at her nails and says, ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wanna refund. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I look closely over the fabulous dress, smile and say, ‚ÄúOkay, let me see what I can do. ‚Äù The tags have been removed and there are stains on the hem.  
  
¬† Uh oh. Great.  
  
¬† Shit just got serious.  
  
¬† I hate confrontations; they give me hives.  
  
¬† I clear my throat and say, ‚ÄúThis dress has been worn ma‚Äôam. I can‚Äôt give you a refund or exchange. I‚Äôm sorry but our policies are clear. They‚Äôre on the walls and receipt. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her scowl re-appears. She would be so pretty if she smiled.  
  
¬† She leans forward and hisses right in my face, ‚ÄúThis is BULLSHIT! That dress cost me THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS!‚Äù I know this. The dress is one of our most expensive pieces and is fab-U-lous. I really want to ask her if her daddy actually bought it but she continues. ‚ÄúIt looks like a godd  
amn potato sack!‚Äù  
  
¬† I feel the flush rising up my neck and I so badly want to scratch at it. I say quietly, ‚ÄúLike I said ma‚Äôam, there‚Äôs nothing I can do. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her lip curls and she spits, ‚ÄúI wanna speak to a manager. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod and respond, ‚ÄúI am the manager. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She smiles almost cruelly and says, ‚ÄúThen I wanna speak to the owner. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I stare her right in the eyeball and I‚Äôm thankful none of my girls are working.  
  
¬† I say in a firm voice, ‚ÄúI am the owner. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her face shifts into something even uglier than her scowl. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but if looks could kill, I‚Äôd be six feet under. She snatches the dress out of my hands and storms out of my store.  
  
¬† Rawr Raaawr.  
  
¬† Damn it.  
  
¬† Crap! Forgot to get batteries for the doorbell. Again.  
  
¬† I look out the window past the mannequins, and the She-Devil is walking across the street to a man standing with his back to me. He looks big. Not fat but built. She-Devil talks a mile a minute pointing towards Safira. The man is obviously talking back to her because she stops talking and starts pouting. Then she stomps her foot. Yes, actually stomps her foot and pushes her chest out while pouting up at his face. I can almost hear her whining. She walks off and the man turns towards Safira and shakes his head slowly. What a spoiled brat!  
  
¬† It takes me a second to notice the man.  
  
¬† Oh. My. God.  
  
¬† Angels must have broken out in song when this man was born. I feel like breaking out in song.  
  
¬† He is so handsome.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll admit I can‚Äôt see his face very well from across the street but I can see enough of it to see he is hot. As in hawt. And the rest of him is just as impressive. He‚Äôs tall, probably 6‚Äô2‚Äù or 6‚Äô3‚Äù, and has gorgeous olive-toned skin. He‚Äôs dressed in suit pants and a shirt. He has broad shoulders and great arms; I can tell from the muscle definition I can see through his shirt. He has a face made of straight angles and his lips have a natural pout to them. His hair is styled in a masculine faux hawk, shaved at the sides, longer on top, and spiked up and to the left side of his head. I can‚Äôt see his eye color from where I am, though.  
  
¬† This makes me sad.  
  
¬† I want to walk up to him and hold his face in my hands just so I can get a good look at him, but that would be rude. And I‚Äôd probably get arrested after he called the cops on me.  
  
¬† The only turn off I can see from my vantage point is that he‚Äôs smoking.  
  
¬† He looks angry, too. His lip is curled as he looks into Safira‚Äôs window.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll come in here and yell at me trying to get his girlfriend‚Äôs money back for the fabulous dress she‚Äôs ruined. I just know my neck is red, I can tell from how much it‚Äôs itching.  
  
¬† Please, please don‚Äôt come in here and yell at me, Mr. Large Man.  
  
¬† Like an answer to my silent prayer he throws his cigarette butt onto the pavement (another turn off‚Äîlitter bug), steps on it, and walks into a building I was told by my girls is a very popular nightclub.  
  
¬† From the front of the building it doesn‚Äôt look like much. The large double doors are the typical ones you‚Äôd normally see at a club. It also looks narrow. Not quite as narrow as Safira but still narrow for a club. The sign atop the door catches my eye.  
  
¬† The White Rabbit.  
  
¬† The sign is white with a whimsical feel to it. The words are written in black and it all looks very plain but artsy.  
  
¬† What a strange name for a club.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm confused.  
  
¬† Why would he be at a nightclub during the day?  
  
¬† Maybe he‚Äôs security? He‚Äôs definitely built for it.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm intrigued. I want to know more about him.  
  
¬† The week passes and I observe the man from afar. I have made mental notes. He takes three cigarette breaks a day. He is always dressed in business attire. And I never see him leave. But something about him bothers me.  
  
¬† I have never seen him smile.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Meems breaks my thoughts with, ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù  
  
¬† Uh, what?  
  
¬† Confusion settles over my features and I reply, ‚ÄúWell what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you have a nice trip?‚Äù Mimi smirks. ‚ÄúYou were miles away, babe‚Äù  
  
¬† Oops.  
  
¬† I cringe and say, ‚ÄúSorry. What were you saying?‚Äù  
  
¬† She looks livid. Her blue eyes flash at me and she spits, ‚ÄúI said that fine ass man is out there again!‚Äù  
  
¬† I want to stroke her shoulder length silky sunny blonde hair but this is a no-go with Mimi. I‚Äôm very affectionate and hugged Mimi once. Once was enough to realize this is a no-go because when we parted from said hug, she looked at me like I ran over her dog.  
  
¬† I save all my workplace affection for Lola who is a bit younger than me and comes from an affectionate household. She gets me.  
  
¬† I sigh through my response. ‚ÄúYeah. I saw him, Meems. He‚Äôs looking pretty good today. Lilac is a good color on him. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes widen and she almost yells, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all you have to say?‚Äù She narrows her eyes at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been watching him for two weeks, Tina. Grow some balls and ask the dude out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Um, No.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt do relationships.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm twenty eight years old and have only been in one relationship. It was good in the beginning. It totally sucked at the end. Never again.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve dated men since my relationship went bust, quite a few actually. But not one of those men broke through the thick wall I‚Äôve built around myself. I call it protecting myself. It works and I‚Äôm sticking to it. It‚Äôs a bit lonely but at least I have my friends.  
  
¬† I lower my eyes, fold another sweater and whisper, ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt do that, hon. I think a new box of those linen shirts came in. Can you please steam and shelf them?‚Äù  
  
¬† Her face shows her frustration and she mutters, ‚ÄúWay to change the subject, boss lady. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I watch her walk into the stock room but my attention is pulled back to building across from mine.  
  
¬† On the counter next to the register are two clear cellophane wrapped bags of candy. One has Raspberry bullets in it, which are my all-time favorite; the other holds red wax lips.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt have to talk to him to be nice to him. He won‚Äôt ever know who they came from.  
  
¬† I set aside the wax lips on the counter and taking a piece of paper from next to the register I write three small words. I fold up my note, punch a hole in it, and tie it around the candy using the red foil ribbon we use to gift wrap items with.  
  
¬† I look at the time on the register.  
  
¬† Another hour and he‚Äôll be back for another cigarette break.  
  
¬† I walk into the stock room and tell Mimi I need a break. She comes out front to man the counter for me. I walk out of Safira‚Äôs and turn left to the coffee shop next door.  
  
¬† I know every person who works at Winnie‚Äôs coffee lounge and they know me and my girls pretty well, too. We‚Äôre there at least three times every day to get our coffee fix, and believe me when I tell you Winnie‚Äôs coffee is the bomb.

¬†It‚Äôs not a large coffee lounge. In fact, there is only one three seater lounge in the store because that‚Äôs all it can fit. It‚Äôs about a quarter of the size of Safira‚Äôs and I‚Äôm sure at one point our two stores used to be one.  
  
¬† I go in to find Sammi behind the counter.  
  
¬† Perfect. Just who I need to see.  
  
¬† I walk over to him and smile, he smiles back flirtatiously.  
  
¬† Sammi is eighteen; he works at Winnie‚Äôs part time and goes to college. He is cute. At least, I think he is under all that dark hair. His hair is long and brushed forward over one eye. The eye that I can see is a warm brown color.  
  
¬† He smiles and says, ‚ÄúTina, babe, what can I get you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Ever the charmer, I reply, ‚ÄúActually, Sammi, I need a favor. ‚Äù  
  
¬† His face shows unconcealed surprise. A small smile forms on his lips and he says in a husky voice, ‚ÄúSure! Whatever you need‚Ä¶‚Äù He licks his lips in invitation.  
  
¬† I laugh, put a hand on my chest and say, ‚ÄúOh my, not that kind of favor! Sammi, I‚Äôm old enough to be your Mo‚Ä¶uh, older sister. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He wiggles his brows at me and responds, ‚ÄúMy sister ain‚Äôt a hottie. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt help but laugh. We banter like this all the time. It‚Äôs harmless and Sammi is a sweetheart.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan you help me or not?‚Äù I say in mock sternness with my hands on my hips.  
  
¬† That charming smile appears again and he replies, ‚ÄúAnything for you, babe. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I explain to him what I need done and he looks at me like I‚Äôve lost my mind. After pleading with him and planting and a wet, sloppy kiss on his cheek, he finally agrees.  
  
¬† I jump up and down in victory, thank him and walk back to Safira. I relieve Mimi, take my place at the counter and wait to see what happens.  
  
¬† A half hour passes and the beautiful man across the street appears, right on time, cigarette in hand. I spot Sammi making his way across the street and anxiety knots my stomach.  
  
¬† This was a bad idea. What was I thinking??! God, I am such a turd!  
  
¬† Sammi approaches beautiful man and hands a small brown paper bag to him. Sammi says a few words and walks away. He spies me through Safira‚Äôs window and winks at me.  
  
¬† I watch Mr. Beautiful open the brown paper bag and take out the candy.  
  
¬† He looks confused. I‚Äôm not surprised.  
  
¬† He tears the note off the ribbon, opens it and reads. He looks even more confused and my heart shrinks.  
  
¬† What I see next makes it all worth it.  
  
¬† His eyes crinkle and a small smile twitches at his lips.  
  
¬† Not great, but definite progress. This is the first smile I‚Äôve seen grace his gorgeous face and it was nice. I can‚Äôt help but smile, too.  
  
¬† Yay, me! See?! Not such a bad idea after all.  
  
¬† A deep sigh escapes me. I feel at peace once again. I go about my work with a huge smile plastered on my face.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Rawr Raaawr  
  
¬† I inwardly cringe and glare at the damn door.  
  
¬† A man stands there.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs smiling but his eyes look at me like being a girl is a disease and you can catch it from visiting a boutique.  
  
¬† He is tall, probably 6‚Äô2‚Äù. Olive skin tone and amber colored eyes.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm mesmerised.  
  
¬† His eyes are like honey! I‚Äôve never seen that eye color before. He has dark brown spiky hair and a nice five o‚Äôclock shadow.  
  
¬† Wow, this man is gorgeous.  
  
¬† He looks to be about my age. He walks over to me, places both forearms on my counter, leans in close and asks, ‚ÄúCan you help me, honey?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI. Ahh‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôm tongue tied. His voice is as smooth as his honey eyes.  
  
¬† Having obviously heard a man‚Äôs voice in the store, Mimi comes to stand next to me.  
  
¬† She looks Mr. Gorgeous up and down and narrows her eyes. She says firmly, ‚ÄúI can help you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looks her up and down the same way she‚Äôd done mere seconds before and smiles a big smile. Mr Gorgeous has a dimple.  
  
¬† My knees almost buckle and I start to sweat.  
  
¬† He smirks as he responds, ‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm looking for the owner of this. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I look down and feel the flush rise from my chest up. This is because on the counter sits my Mr. Beautiful note.  
  
¬† Mimi looks down, brow scrunched in confusion. She reads the note and I know I‚Äôm totally busted. Meems knows my handwriting.  
  
¬† I feel her stare bore into me, I won‚Äôt look at her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice colored with amusement.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm red, splotchy, and embarrassed. I look towards the man who is now looking at me with narrowed eyes, his head at a tilt. Like he‚Äôs trying to read my mind or figure me out.  
  
¬† Before I can stop myself, I answer with a shrill, ‚ÄúHow did he know it was me?‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Gorgeous takes the note from the counter and turns it over. We all look down and what I see makes me even redder. I hear Mimi burst out laughing. Mr. Gorgeous quietly chuckles.  
  
¬† Safira Boutique.  
  
¬† I wrote on Safira stationary!  
  
¬† I. Am. Mortified.  
  
¬† He was never meant to know!  
  
¬† Mr. Gorgeous speaks, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, sweetheart. You‚Äôre comin‚Äô with me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Uh, What?  
  
¬† I whisper, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù  
  
¬† He flicks his head to the note and says, ‚ÄúBoss wants to see you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Uh, What?  
  
¬† My eyes widen and I whisper loudly, ‚ÄúAm I in trouble?‚Äù  
  
¬† He looks me up and down and his lips lift a little. He answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, sweetheart. ‚Äù He says sweetheart in a way that makes it sound like sweethawt.  
  
¬† He takes my hand that rests on the counter, pulls me next to him, and tucks my hand into the crook his arm. I know he sees uncertainty in my eyes. He looks to Mimi and smiles as he speaks, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have her back in one piece. I‚Äôm Max, by the way. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She does a little head lift and responds, ‚ÄúMimi. ‚Äù She points to me and says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Tina. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He smiles and says, ‚ÄúGreat, she‚Äôll be back soon. ‚Äù He starts pulling me along with him and I turn to glare at Mimi.  
  
¬† Standing tall with eyes wide, she smiles big and lifts her hand in a wave.  
  
¬† Crud! I knew this was a bad idea.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† Friend-zoned  
  
¬† I‚Äôm waiting for Max to get back with information on who sent me the candy and note.  
  
¬† Curiosity eats away at me.  
  
¬† Who the hell would send a guy candy?  
  
¬† Not just any candy, but those goofy wax lips that taste like cardboard.  
  
¬† Someone nutty, that‚Äôs for sure.  
  
¬† Maybe even a past fling. I‚Äôm wracking my brain trying to think if any of the girls I‚Äôve slept with recently were a bit nutty.  
  
¬† There was that one girl who wanted me to‚Ä¶Nah. I smile at the memory. She was the good kind of nutty.  
  
¬† The door to my office bursts open and Max tries to walk in but it looks like something is holding him back.  
  
¬† Max starts laughing and says, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon sweetheart, he won‚Äôt bite. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I stand and step towards the door, my brows furrowed. I decide to sit on the front of my desk.  
  
¬† What did he bring me, a Pitbull?  
  
¬† Max is struggling with whoever is out there and Max is big. And strong. He looks at me like he wants to burst into laughter. Walking back out the office door, he emerges seconds later.  
  
¬† Walking backwards towards me is a woman; Max has his hands on her shoulders and is walking her toward me. Once she hits the middle of the room, he stops walking. He lowers his face to hers and says, ‚ÄúHe just wants to talk, hon. ‚Äù He flicks her hair playfully, turns and walks out. But not before he winks at me.  
  
¬† The woman standing in my office still has her back to me and she‚Äôs looking at the floor. I do a quick scan of her from the back. Medium height; maybe 5‚Äù5 or 5‚Äù6 without the black pumps she‚Äôs rockin‚Äô. Nice body. Great ass. Long dark hair to her waist. It‚Äôs shiny and has a nice natural wave to it.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs now been over a minute and this slip of a woman still hasn  
‚Äôt turned to face me.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm getting irritated now.  
  
¬† I have to break the ice.  
  
¬† I say, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right, you know. I won‚Äôt bite. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Her shoulders stiffen but she slowly turns to face me. Her face is still lowered so I can‚Äôt see what she looks like.  
  
¬† I take a look at her body from the front. Decent boobs. Nice curvy body. She‚Äôs dressed nicely, wearing a white linen shirt and a high waisted grey skirt. You know the ones that are tight around the ass and get tighter around the knees?  
  
¬† Nice.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs also wearing a thick black belt that goes just under her boobs. The more I look at her, the sexier she becomes.  
  
¬† This somehow makes me more irritated.  
  
¬† I ask a little too firmly, ‚ÄúCan you look at me, miss? I just wanna ask you a few questions. Nothin‚Äô to be worried about. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She nods and lifts her head.  
  
¬† Oh, Hell.  
  
¬† I fight the urge to roll my eyes.  
  
¬† Not a past fling, that‚Äôs for sure.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs cute. And flushed, I mean, really flushed. It kinda makes her cuter. Not just cute, but adorable.  
  
¬† And she‚Äôs petrified.  
  
¬† I have no idea why. I mean, I know I‚Äôm a big guy but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that scary.  
  
¬† She has light green eyes that are unusual because they have a black rim, a cute little nose, and her lips‚Ä¶Oh, man.  
  
¬† Her top lip is full and her bottom lip is fuller.  
  
¬† Damn.  
  
¬† Using my foot, I pull out a chair and motion for her to sit. Thankfully, she does so without hesitating.  
  
¬† Who is this girl?  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Uh, that voice.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs the type of voice you hear in your own made up fantasies. Deep and sexy.  
  
¬† I look up at Mr Beautiful and Wow. He‚Äôs actually even more beautiful up close.  
  
¬† Now that I‚Äôm close enough to him, I can see he has the same eye color as Max. He looks a lot like Max, too. I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre brothers or at least related.  
  
¬† Just above his eyebrow is a scar; it goes through his eyebrow at an angle and ends at the outer tip of his eye.  
  
¬† A scowl mars his face and he sighs deeply.  
  
¬† He stands up and walks around the desk, sits behind it and takes his cufflinks out of the button holes of his silk lilac shirt. Not many men could pull off looking manly in lilac. But he‚Äôs just that awesome.  
  
¬† He rolls up the sleeves to his elbows. I think he‚Äôs done this to make me a little more comfortable around him. I‚Äôm surprised that it works. The simple move has made him much less intimidating and I feel myself loosen up.  
  
¬† He sounds bored when he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Nik. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He already thinks you‚Äôre a weirdo, don‚Äôt you dare freeze up now. It‚Äôs just talking.  
  
¬† I reply a little too loudly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tina. ‚Äù  
  
¬† His lips twitch. He asks, ‚ÄúYou work at Safira‚Äôs Boutique?‚Äù  
  
¬† I simply nod.  
  
¬† He points to the note which now sits on his desk and asks, ‚ÄúCan you tell me who gave me this note?‚Äù  
  
¬† Immediately I respond, ‚ÄúI did. ‚Äù Just like ripping off a band aid, the quicker you do it the less painful it is.  
  
¬† His brow furrows in confusion, he taps his pen on the desk and says, ‚ÄúOh. I guess you could say I‚Äôm a little curious about the note. And what‚Äôs written on it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I flush even warmer and slide deeper into the chair.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm so embarrassed!  
  
¬† I quickly respond, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry if I offended you in any way. I, ah, I think I should just go. ‚Äù I move to stand but he reaches over the table and takes my hand in his huge one.  
  
¬† He says, ‚ÄúSit down, please. ‚Äù This is not a request.  
  
¬† He places my hand back on the desk and I park my butt back down. He reaches for the note and reads aloud, ‚ÄúSmile sometime, handsome. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Yep. I‚Äôm an Idiot.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† This Tina woman closes her eyes and cringes when I read the note aloud; it‚Äôs so cute I have to bite my lip to stop myself from laughing.  
  
¬† She straightens up, looks me in the eye and says matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that every day you come outside for your cigarette break which, by the way, smoking kills. ‚Äù She scrunches her nose, and says quietly, ‚ÄúBut at least it didn‚Äôt stunt your growth. ‚Äù She looks thoughtful, places her fingers to her chin and tilts her head slightly. Her head straightens suddenly as if she just remembered she wasn‚Äôt done and she continues, ‚ÄúAnd I see you out there every day but you‚Äôre never happy. And you never smile. Like ever. And I just wanted to, anonymously, make your day a bit better and make you smile because, frankly, watching you is a bit depressing. And I know it‚Äôs none of my business and you have the right to be as broody as you damn well please, but I like when people smile and I like making people smile!‚Äù She finishes a little louder than she needs to be. I have to stop myself from running my hands down my face.  
  
¬† Yeah, too cute.  
  
¬† I feel a frown form.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt do cute. She has a great ass that I would definitely like in my bed but I don‚Äôt do cute.  
  
¬† Cute girls wanna kiss. I don‚Äôt do that shit. Kissing means special things like relationships and girlfriends. And I don‚Äôt have relationships or girlfriends. I have fuck buddies. Because I fuck. Often. I most definitely don‚Äôt make love. I might not screw hard all the time but even slow screwing is just screwing.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt have the time or the inclination to make the effort to keep a girlfriend.  
  
¬† One day, when I‚Äôm not knee deep in nightclub bullshit, I‚Äôll find a nice girl and settle down. I‚Äôll make sure that girl will be worth it. But that time is not now.  
  
¬† Tina is looking at my eyes and asks, ‚ÄúWhat color are your eyes?‚Äù  
  
¬† Uh oh, she‚Äôs making goo-goo eyes at me. Crap, cut her loose and let her be on her way.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Nik shifts in his chair almost nervously as he replies, ‚ÄúUh, I don‚Äôt really know. Like a gold-ish brown or somethin‚Äô. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I push the eye color thing. I tell him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen eyes that color. It‚Äôs like warm honey. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looks away and swallows hard before he says, ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I guess. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh my, he is nervous.  
  
¬† As he looks toward the bookcase in the corner and I spy ink travelling up the back of his neck past the back of his ear. It‚Äôs black, thick, and looks tribal.  
  
¬† Yummy.  
  
¬† He won‚Äôt look me in the eye now and I wonder what I said to get a reaction like the one he‚Äôs giving me.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm confused. Frowning, I take a look around his office while I try to figure him out. It‚Äôs nice. The walls are a pale sandy color. His desk is wooden and looks heavy. This desk was not bought at Ikea. This was the type of desk you bought at an antique store and had re-finished. It‚Äôs clearly mahogany (La dee dah!). And I notice the whole room is neat; not a stray paper in sight. I can‚Äôt even see my desk in Safira‚Äôs store room! It‚Äôs covered in papers, stock, and trash.  
  
¬† Mental note; find your desk.  
  
¬† There are two framed photos on the mahogany bookshelf in the corner of the office.  
  
¬† One is of a little girl who is so beautiful, my heart aches. Her smile is pure sunshine and she is missing one of her front teeth. She has Nik‚Äôs eyes. The frame is bright pink with purple glittery butterflies around it.  
  
¬† Aww, cute.  
  
¬† The other frame is exquisite. It is thick silver with pieces of beige mother of pearl swirling through it. The photo is an old one, a family portrait it looks like. A tall, dark haired, middle aged man stands with his arms around a short but beautiful dark haired, dark eyed woman. The woman is very much pregnant. The man looks like Nik but he is pale skinned where Nik is much darker. Most importantly are the man‚Äôs eyes. They are Nik‚Äôs eyes. I‚Äôm going to take a stab and say these are Nik‚Äôs parents.  
  
¬† Two small girls flank the couple, hugging them both around the legs. Hugging the two girls are two young men. Looking closer at this picture I can see Max‚Äôs cheeky dimpled smile and it confirms my earlier suspicions that Nik and Max are brothers. Both girls have their mother‚Äôs eyes; both boys have their father‚Äôs eyes. All the children got their mother‚Äôs beautiful skin tone. They are all laughing and smiling.  
  
¬† Wow, I love this photo.  
  
¬† Everyone in this picture is so happy. Like, blissfully happy. I think back to Nik and wonder what happened to his happiness.  
  
¬† I take another look around but there is nothing else to note except a filing cabinet in the opposite corner of the room close to the door.  
  
¬† No more photos, nothing at all personal, nothing to suggest he has a girlfriend or wife.  
  
¬† Then it clicks.  
  
¬† His reaction to my stupid questions. And I almost burst out laughing but manage to stop it and make a choked sound instead.  
  
¬† He thinks I‚Äôm coming onto him!  
  
¬† I mean, I can‚Äôt blame him for thinking that because he is beauty defined. And now that I‚Äôve spent some time with him I realize I had nothing to be nervous about. He seems like a nice, well-mannered guy but still a little too broody for my liking.  
  
¬† An idea enters my brain and before I can think about it and verbal diarrhea spews forth.  
  
¬† \*\*\*  
  
¬† Tina spends a good few minutes looking around my office. Her eyes land on the family portrait which was taken a few months before Dad died.  
  
¬† I realize she‚Äôs looking for photos of a wife or girlfriend.  
  
¬† Here we go. She‚Äôs gonna make her move. I should‚Äôve left the damn note thing alone.  
  
¬† Tina makes a choked noise and I look up to find her trying to hold back a smile.  
  
¬† Cut her loose and no one gets hurt. She‚Äôs too cute.  
  
¬† She is too cute. Too cute to fuck and leave, she ain‚Äôt that type. I can tell. I spend a lot of time with girls like that and they normally have the same interests as me.  
  
¬† Sex without strings.  
  
¬† My body tenses. How do I turn her down without sounding like an asshole?  
  
¬† Girls like Tina hurt easy. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt deal with girls like this.  
  
¬† She‚Äôs smiling a small smile and waiting for me to say something. I don‚Äôt know what to say to her, she‚Äôs nervous as it is and doesn‚Äôt need me going all asshole on her.

1nxitvw,https://i.redd.it/aiis64rjf0tf1.jpeg,Would you go here? The Kitten‚Äôs Caboodle,"There once was a quiet artist who felt his own colors had faded to gray. He‚Äôd walk the streets of his city, feeling like a ghost, observing the vibrant lives in the shops and restaurants but never quite feeling a part of them. The world, to him, was like a library full of beautiful books he‚Äôd forgotten how to read.

One chilly October evening, a small calico cat with one gold-orange paw began following him. It didn't meow; it just looked at him with intelligent, ancient-seeming eyes. Intrigued, he followed it down a forgotten alleyway to a dusty brick building he'd never noticed before. The cat slipped through a crack in the door. He hesitated at first, then pushed it open.

The inside wasn't empty. It was a wonderful, dusty mess - a whole kit and caboodle of forgotten things: stacks of old books, mismatched velvet chairs, lonely coffee mugs, and canvases that hummed with the ghosts of unfinished paintings. The calico cat was curled on a velvet cushion, and the air was filled with a low, calming purr that felt less like a sound and more like... a state of profound peace.

He spent the night there, and for the first time in years, he felt the gray recede. He picked up a piece of charcoal and began to sketch the sleeping cat.

He never found the owner of the building, but he knew he'd found its purpose.

Kitten's Caboodle wasn't just opened; it was discovered. It's a sanctuary for quiet, creative souls. The coffee machine in the place was tuned to hum at the same calming frequency as the calico's purr. It is said that anyone who feels their own colors have faded can come, hold a warm mug, borrow a cat for inspiration, and find their own spark again in the cozy, magical mess of the place.",2,1759546643.0,cats,1,1.0,False

Ever found yourself lost in the endless rabbit hole of doomscrolling? üôà You know, those late-night scroll fests where you read all about the world's problems, but the only thing you‚Äôre really solving is what snack to munch on next? If you nodded your head, you're not alone!

But what if I told you that instead of wasting hours reading about things that make you want to pull your hair out, you could actually *make* money using AI? üí∏ Seriously, it's time to flip the script!

Here are **3 AI monetization strategies** you NEED to try NOW. Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in!

1. **Content Creation**: ‚úçÔ∏è 
   - Instead of letting AI AI generate content *for* you, partner with it! Use tools like ChatGPT or Jasper to brainstorm ideas, create outlines, and draft amazing articles or blog posts while you sip your morning coffee. You could even write e-books in a week that sell like hotcakes on Amazon!

2. **Affiliate Marketing**: üíª 
   - Okay, hear me out. Have you ever shared a product you love and got paid for it? With AI, you can analyze which products are trending and create focused content that attracts clicks! Picture this: you write a newsletter that uses AI insights to suggest the hottest gadgets, and boom ‚Äî you‚Äôre earning commission for every sale! 

3. **Online Courses & Workshops**: üéì 
   - If you have knowledge to share (and we know you do!), craft an online course. But here‚Äôs the kicker: use AI to assess who your target audience is and tailor your content to meet their needs. You can automate the marketing process, too, so it‚Äôs like having a personal assistant that never takes breaks. 

Isn‚Äôt that way more satisfying than scrolling through Twitter doom and gloom? üòÖ Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love the extra cash? The possibilities are endless when you start viewing AI as your partner instead of just a tool.

So the next time you catch yourself scrolling mindlessly, think about these strategies. Are there any you‚Äôve tried before or new ones you‚Äôd love to explore? 

Let‚Äôs swap ideas and keep each other motivated. Ready to earn instead of scroll? Let‚Äôs go! üí™‚ú®",1,1759546467.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1nxiqye,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1nxiqye/in_which_i_take_out_years_of_frustration_on_some/,In which I take out years of frustration on some a-holes,"I used to work a help desk phone line for a local computer reseller, supporting our customers, but we also took call-ins on a billable basis. One day I received a call from a client looking for a technical company: They needed someone to repossess their leased computer equipment from a customer that had defaulted on their payments. I bumped it up to my boss.

A few days later, me and another tech were given a contact phone number for our client and told to contact her. I did and she explained they'd be faxing over a list of serial numbers and non-serialized items to repossess. Their customer had been served the notice of repossession, but apparently didn't take it seriously. She told me their receptionist blew cigarette smoke in the face of the Deputy Sherriff who had served them and if they give me any grief, don't press the issue.

So me (scrawny four-eyed tech guy) and another field guy (even scrawnier four-eyed tech guy) go to the address, tell the receptionist (who was about a gazillion years old, with a cigarette in her mouth and an ashtray on her desk overflowing with butts) we were there to reclaim equipment subject to a court order.

She told us to f off. I told her the company was in violation of a court order; she said she didn't care. Me and scrawny tech left and I told our contact what had happened.

""Those assholes,"" she replied, then told me I did the right thing and they'd hear from us again. I passed the info on to my boss.

About a week later, my boss told me to contact our customer and she worked with us to schedule me & some people to head back down to deadbeat company: We'd have two deputies with us and they were ready to arrest anyone who gave us trouble. She also explained that, when the president of deadbeat company was called back into the courtroom he complained we didn't have the ability to carry the stuff out of their office (a lie). The judge told him we could carry it to the elevator and drop it down the shaft if we wanted to, then gave him three days for contempt of court.

I showed up, not with scrawnier tech, but with two delivery guys: They were big, ugly, straight from the hood, and couldn't get a security clearance for deliveries & installs to our federal customers. Perfect!

Two deputies were waiting for us at the site; I introduced myself & our delivery guys, and the senior deputy (who looked and sounded like a Marine Corps DI) announced to the office no one was to give us trouble before telling us to get to work. My guys took their lists and headed out into the office to start grabbing stuff.

I noticed a woman was banging on the 220V plug for a big VAX-looking thing; I looked at our list and it was something we were to repo.¬†That¬†we weren't ready for, so I moved over, twisted the plug and unplugged it, then called our contact. ""Oh, yeah, forgot to tell you how big that was. Can you do something to disable it? Don't break it but remove the memory or something?"" I told her I could probably figure something out before hanging up, and I started opening panels.

I found the drives and realized taking those would be perfect, so I started yanking them when someone who I suspect was the freshly out-of-jail-for-contempt president came running toward me screaming....something. I think he used the word, ""data.""

A deputy was there before I could blink, pepper spray in hand, and he told the dude to sit down before he gets arrested. He looked at the pepper spray, then their holstered guns (the deputies were on duty, after all), and went back into his office.

Now, not everything in that office was on the list to be seized, but everything was from the same manufacturer (Compaq), so it was possible to grab desktop s/n XYZ, and while the computer next to this one wasn't on our list, we needed the keyboard...so I'll take¬†that¬†kb, and, oh, yeah, the mouse to¬†this one¬†over here, and, hey, that monitor is on the list....yoink!

My friends, I unleashed my inner asshole that day, while my assistants were already assholes and were having as much fun as I. Years of dealing with jerk clients came out and these guys paid for it. Plugs were pulled willy-nilly. Printers picked up in the middle of print jobs. We grabbed a couple of staplers just because and I don't think we left a pen in that office. Later I found out both of my guys had grabbed coffee mugs with the company logo on it; I wished I had thought of that. Only one person complained when her kb was yanked off her desk; Deputy DI told her¬†THIS¬†IS¬†FUCKING SERIOUS, LADY! NOW SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP BEFORE YOU REGRET IT!!!!

Soon we had just a few items still on our list and we turned to the president's office. The deputies knocked to no answer even though we saw the guy go in, then the Deputy DI used his DI voice and got the door open without resorting to violence. I yanked the plug on the desktop before checking the serial number and¬†*ooops*¬†sorry about that; it's not a laptop.

I asked the president where the laptop was; he said he didn't know. I looked at the deputy and he said to go ahead and look where ever I needed to. My assistants looked like bulls who had seen red, when the president jumped up and told us we couldn't go into his desk.

Remember how, the last time the president tried to stop me from doing something and had pepper spray pulled on him? This time Deputy DI didn't draw his pepper spray; he drew his taser. I figure that deputy was the guy who had had smoke blown in his face and he was tired of this BS. ""WHERE'S THE MOTHER-LOVING LAPTOP!!!""¬†he demanded.

The president pointed at a closet; one of my guys went in there and pulled a laptop from it. Checked the s/n and it was ours. While big and ugly, he wasn't dumb: ""Where's the power supply?"" he asked. The president pointed under his desk and the other guy retrieved it. We grabbed a printer & the monitor from that office before deciding we had grabbed everything we needed.

(I later heard one of my guys had grabbed something kind of valuable off the president‚Äôs desk, right in front of two deputies. I never found out exactly what it was, but you gotta be impressed. Rumor was he pawned it for over $200.)

We returned to the office and delivered the stuff to our receiving & shipping department (where it would be boxed up for delivery to the client‚Äôs address), and went to my bosses office; we called the contact on speakerphone to give her a report. She thanked us profusely, and chuckled when I told her the president had pepper spray pulled on him, and guffawed when told he had a taser drawn on him, too.

After hanging up my boss asked me how it was, and I told him the truth: ""Man....that was a¬†lot¬†of fun!""",9,1759546392.0,revengestories,1,0.91,False

I think there is no one else who understands my insecurities and anxieties better than she does. I hope we can close the gap asap, maybe then I will be more grounded and happier. Right now, I just get phases where I get so extremely sad and emotional.

FIL, we will call him Hank, is a textbook narcissist.  He is NEVER in the wrong, always has to be the victim in any situation he is in, and has been completely enabled by his mother, my husband‚Äôs grandmother. He is also extremely racist (this is super important), a chauvinist (I‚Äôm sure that is a huge surprise), and we have recently found out he is a major pathological liar. 

My husband, John, and I have been together for almost 18 years. We basically grew up together and have created a beautiful life for ourselves and our little family.  At the beginning of our relationship Hank seemed like a wonderful man, always doting on his children, step children, and wife, John‚Äôs step mom Cora.  He would say things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait until you are my daughter!‚Äù It was sweet, but I wish it had been genuine.  

Five years into our relationship, we got married! When planning, Hank‚Äôs side of the family made it VERY clear that they were not to sit anywhere close to John‚Äôs mother, Haley, or her family. Also, Hank‚Äôs entire side of family lives out of state.  When he and Haley split, Hank packed up and moved 14 hours away to live with Cora.  Our wedding was beautiful, but you could definitely feel the tension and hostility coming from Hank‚Äôs side towards Haley‚Äôs side.  This is where things started to change and I started to see Hank‚Äôs true colors.  

Not long into our marriage, we were pressured about having children from Hank‚Äôs side of the family.  We were struggling with fertility issues and undergoing fertility treatments in secret.  While visiting Hank, the topic of ‚Äúwhen are you having kids‚Äù came up yet again.  John and I just looked at each other and said our usual ‚Äúwhen the timing is right, it will happen.‚Äù  Hank smirked, then said ‚ÄúWell Marie(me), maybe if you weren‚Äôt so fat, you would be able to give John the kids he wants.‚Äù  It got super quiet, John actually was diagnosed as sterile and we were doing everything in our power to try to get some healthy swimmers.  After a minute, John, bless his wonderful soul, said ‚ÄúMarie is perfect. Her weight is a non-issue, not that that is at all any of your concern.  Stay in your lane, please.‚Äù  Hank muttered something under his breath about his son being brainwashed, but we just let it go.  During that same trip, we were having dinner with Hank, Cora, and her 12 year old daughter, Nattie.  Nattie was a sweet kid, I don‚Äôt remember exactly what she had said to set Hank off, honestly it probably was absolutely nothing, but his response was absolutely disgusting.  He looked at Nattie and said ‚ÄúWell, if that is how you‚Äôre going to act, you won‚Äôt ever amount to anything.  You will end up getting knocked up in your teens by some (derogatory African American slur) and live off the government.‚Äù  I was absolutely floored and appalled.  Remember when I said that his racism is important?  I am of mixed races, meaning his grandchildren will also be mixed.  I actually stated this and Hank has the audacity to say ‚ÄúWell you look white, so that doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù 

Fast forward through seven years of tears, heartbreak, and negative pregnancy tests.  I had gone to the hospital with some intense stomach pain.  It was there that I found out I was actually 7 weeks along with our now precious son! We could not be more happy!  

The pregnancy was relatively smooth until my 34 week appointment.  My blood pressure was sky high, and I was told that I was preeclamptic.  I was then admitted and they started inducing immediately.  I labored for 46 horrific hours.  At one point, around the 32 hour mark, John left to pick up his sister from the airport and to also check on our fur babies.  I had been put on some intense pain meds that knocked me out because my epidural had continued to fail repeatedly.  I awoke with a start, and there just staring at me from a chair on one side of bed was none other than creepy Hank.  I remember being so horrified and disgusted, but then my drugs kicked back in and I was out like a light.  I thought maybe it was a nightmare, but nope, Hank actually bragged about staring at me ‚Äúfor hours‚Äù while I was drugged.  What.In.The.Actual?!?!   We also later found out that Hank had said some awful things to my MIL and her husband.  Story for another time.  While we are still in the hospital we find out that Hank and Cora were planning on staying at our house for TWO weeks!!!  Didn‚Äôt even ask, just assumed.  John put his foot down and told Hank that absolutely not, we were not at all prepared to host guests, especially not for two weeks.  Hank then said that they would just bring their RV down and ‚Äúcamp‚Äù in our driveway.  Again, John said no stating we needed our space to acclimate as a new family of three.  After much arguing, instead of just saying okay, they understood our wishes, Hank instead reserved the closest campsite to our house.  Still not great, but at least they weren‚Äôt in my backyard.  Hank and Cora would arrive at our house as early as possible each day and then wear out their welcome by staying late into the evening, all while expecting me to wait on them hand and foot!  John again told his father to stop, that I needed rest and space to recover.  Unfortunately, John had to go back to work within only a day of being home from the hospital, so I was stuck with Hank and Cora for the majority of the time, which of course, Hank still tried order me around, telling me I can ‚Äúrest at night‚Äù and that moving around to cook and clean up after them was ‚Äúgood for you.‚Äù  In my postpartum rage, I finally just screamed at him to shut up and leave my house while sobbing uncontrollably(not my finest moment.) I took my baby and fur babies into my room, slammed the door and locked it, hoping they would do what I asked and leave.  After I calmed down, I came out of my room thinking surely they had gone home.  Nope!  They sat on my couch watching TV.  When he noticed me, Hank said ‚ÄúOh good, you are done with your temper tantrum!  Make me some coffee, I am exhausted!‚Äù  The audacity of this man!  I called my sweet hubby right in front of him and told him in a very eerily calm voice to get his ass home before I unalived his father, to which Hank started laughing hysterically until I gave him the look of death.  I told my husband what happened and he told me to give the phone to his father.  I still to this day have no idea what he said, but Hank responded by handing me my phone, then telling Cora it was time to leave.  They walked out without a word.  Unfortunately they still came back every single day, but silver lining‚Ä¶Hank stopped trying to boss me around like some servant who hadn‚Äôt JUST given birth.  

Fast forward again to four years later.  Cora had divorced Hank (shocker, I know) a couple of years prior. Well before the divorce was final, Hank went on a complete dating spree.  He is free to live his life, but we also didn‚Äôt want our son meeting a new ‚Äúgrandma‚Äù every time we visited.  Hank is also bragging to everyone we know about what a wonderful grandfather he was, and how he had such an amazing relationship with our son.  That could not have been farther from the truth.  Every time  we visited, Hank would act like he didn‚Äôt have time for his only grandchild by playing games on his phone and texting his various lady friends instead of actually spending time with him.  Hank would then get annoyed anytime our sweet boy would ask him to play with him.  Hank even started to cop an attitude with him, which is where we finally drew the line and had a come to Jesus with him.  Definitely went in one ear and out the other because Hank didn‚Äôt change, only became sneakier with it, talking down to our son behind our backs and blaming his tears on being ‚Äúovertired.‚Äù  Then we met the amazing Deedee, Hank‚Äôs newest pursuit.  Deedee has a kind and compassionate spirit, she just exudes light and love!  Deedee made it her mission to bond with our little boy and become the grandmother he always wanted on that side of the family.  She would always bring him the most thoughtful gifts after listening to him talk and finding out his favorite things. She would get on the floor with him and play trains for hours. She would buy him board games so that she could teach him how to play together.  She would ask us if she could take him to hidden little ice cream spots and let him try as many flavors as he could stand!  She truly loves our boy, and the feeling is most definitely mutual.  Around the time we had met Deedee, I had lost a significant amount of weight, over 160 pounds!  I felt great and my body was much healthier!  Then, we got pregnant with our second child.  We were over the moon because we didn‚Äôt think it would be possible to naturally conceive again!  Unfortunately, our sweet little Angel wasn‚Äôt meant to be earth side, and passed away at only 10 weeks gestation.  We were absolutely shattered.  A few months later, my sweet John lost his job.  We knew it was fight or flight, so we chose to fight and start our business.  The same exact day this all went down, we found out we were pregnant again!  We remained cautiously optimistic, but doing everything we could in hopes that we could help this little one survive.  Appointments went well, my numbers looked amazing, and I was feeling all the first trimester symptoms.  I was right at 15 weeks when I woke up to a horrible, bloody mess.  I prayed it wasn‚Äôt what we feared, but deep down we both knew.  It was July 3rd, so I knew even if I got an appointment I wouldn‚Äôt receive any results until after the 4th of July.  I still made an appointment, they weren‚Äôt able to ultrasound but drew blood to watch for my numbers.  Surprisingly, our numbers came back the morning of the 4th and I was able see on my patient portal that my numbers had actually continued to rise.  My husband and I were so happy, we thought this was excellent news, even while my bleeding had become SO heavy that I was bleeding through the heaviest pads on the market in less than an hour.  I felt weak and sick, but I thought that as still my morning sickness, not equating that to the blood loss.  July 5th finally comes and I go to my OBGYN super hopeful.  Unfortunately, our fears were confirmed yet again as my gestational sac had collapsed and my baby was gone.  The next day I had my D&C.  We had already planned a trip to Hank‚Äôs state two days later to share what would have been amazing news.  My husband and I still decided to go so we could get away to the beach as Hank‚Äôs family all live on the coast.  We even stayed at a hotel so that we could visit but have our own space as well.  We had gone to Hank‚Äôs house to visit with him and Deedee.  While there, I started to get emotional, though I tried to hide it as I don‚Äôt like to cry in front of others.  Hank looks at me and instead of offering kind and compassionate words he says ‚ÄúYou just need to get over it and move on.‚Äù  I could have slapped him.  Thankfully, John packed up our son and had me go out to the car with him so that he could have a word with his father.  Soon after we went back to our hotel, where we stayed for the remainder of our trip.  

John‚Äôs grandfather had late stage dementia at this point in time.  A few months after our trip, we got the news that we had feared, his grandfather had passed away.  We made the 14 hour trip back for the funeral and stayed at the same hotel that John‚Äôs other out of town cousins were also staying at.  Though it was a sad occasion, it was nice to reconnect with family we hadn‚Äôt seen in awhile.  This is where the story gets super wild.  One night we were all hanging out at the pool and hot tub, the kids all playing and having a great time.  John‚Äôs cousin, Eileen, and Aunt Ruth were with us warming up in the hot tub when Eileen asked ‚ÄúJohn, how is it that you still have such a close relationship to your mom and step dad after what they did?‚Äù  

Completely perplexed, John asked what she meant by that.

‚ÄúOh, well you know, what they did!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Eileen, I really don‚Äôt.  What are you talking about?‚Äù

Eileen and Aunt Ruth exchange looks and Aunt Ruth gently says ‚ÄúYou know, when you walked in on your mom and now step dad having an affair while she was still married to your father.‚Äù

Dead. Silence.

John: ‚ÄúExcuse me, what????‚Äù

Eileen: ‚ÄúYour mom was in bed with your step dad and you walked in on them in the middle of the act!‚Äù

John: absolutely dumbfounded ‚ÄúI never walked in on my mom cheating on my dad.‚Äù

Aunt Ruth:  ‚ÄúAre you sure you aren‚Äôt in denial?  Your dad told us not to ever bring it up around you so that we don‚Äôt undo the years of therapy you have had to undergo due to the trauma of that situation.‚Äù

John: ‚ÄúWHAT?!?!‚Äù 

A few more of his cousins approach to see what is going on.  Henry, the closest thing to a brother John has, confirmed what Eileen and Aunt Ruth had said to be the exact story he and his siblings had heard as well.  John is absolutely livid at this point.  

John: ‚Äú How could I possibly walk in on my mother having an affair with my step father when I was the one to introduced them at a party at my house almost two years after their divorce?‚Äù   

Absolutely stunned silence.

Aunt Ruth:  ‚ÄúJohn, are you sure? Your dad says that your step dad was his best friend before all that went down.‚Äù

John is absolutely seething at this point.  ‚ÄúHis best friend?!  My dad never met Gary(step dad) until my sister‚Äôs college graduation, years after both had re-married!‚Äù

Eileen: ‚ÄúSo you didn‚Äôt go to therapy?‚Äù

John: ‚ÄúI went to therapy because my dad abandoned me and my sister to be with another woman not two weeks after my mom and him separated.   It had nothing to do with any actions on my mom‚Äôs part, who didn‚Äôt abandon me, by the way.‚Äù 

We were all stunned.  It all finally made sense; the extreme hate Haley received from Hank‚Äôs side of the family, the requests to not be near them at family events, the nastiness in Grandma Lilly‚Äôs voice every time John‚Äôs mothers name was mentioned.  Hank had been lying for over two decades!  Then we started finding out about a ton of other lies.  John wanted to confront Hank, but knew that the funeral of Hank‚Äôs father was not at all the time and place, so he let it go.  Haley was absolutely devastated when we told what Hank had said about her.  He had singlehandedly destroyed her reputation with people she had considered family for over 25 years!  

We went back to visit again a few months later, and many more family members approached us asking if it was true, if John never actually caught Haley cheating on Hank, to which of course we told them the truth.  Even Deedee approached me and I told her the truth as well.  John still didn‚Äôt really know how to confront Hank, and their once close relationship started to become very strained.  

Two weeks after we had left, Deedee called me to tell me that Hank had broken things off with her and that he had been seeing another woman behind her back for almost 6 months.  Hank told her that he was head over heels in love with this other woman and he didn‚Äôt have any romantic feelings left for Deedee.  That was the last straw.  Hank accused Haley of cheating but it seems he has been the unfaithful one the entire time!  Not even two weeks later, Hank calls John to tell him about this new woman and that they were ENGAGED!!! Hank said that couldn‚Äôt wait for our son to meet her, but John stopped him and said absolutely not.  He was putting his foot down and not allowing our son to be hurt by his grandfather.  Our son is on the spectrum so when he gets attached to someone, it is extremely hard to break that attachment.  

John: ‚ÄúWhat about Deedee?  What will I tell our son about his grandma that he loves so very much?‚Äù

Hank: ‚ÄúHe will be fine, he has probably already forgotten about her.‚Äù  

John: ‚ÄúDad we saw you and Deedee less than a month ago, no he isn‚Äôt going to forget!‚Äù

Hank: ‚ÄúWell his feelings aren‚Äôt important in this.‚Äù

John:‚ÄùClearly.‚Äù

Hank;‚Äù New woman is my soulmate!  We were meant to be!  He is going to have to get over it!‚Äù

Only a couple of days later, I was extremely nauseous.  I realized  I was about a week late, but I was so scared to take a test.  I worked up the courage and finally peed on that stick.  Not even 60 seconds and I got a positive.  I took three more, all with the same result.  John and I had decided to keep this one to ourselves for as long as we could to protect our own hearts.  We tried not to get excited, we couldn‚Äôt bear to lose another precious angel.  My doctor saw me immediately and then put me on progesterone in hopes to finally have our sweet little bundle.  At the 20 week mark, we finally felt safe enough to tell our family and closest friends.  Hank responded with ‚ÄúWell, maybe you can actually keep this one this time and not lose it like the others.‚Äù  

As we entered the 3rd trimester, our OB gave us some troubling news.  Our sweet baby girl was not thriving and only in the 2nd percentile.  If we didn‚Äôt do something quick, we could lose her.  I started getting IV‚Äôs of nutrients for the baby while simultaneously drinking as many protein shakes a day as I could possibly stomach.  I did everything I could to add calories in hopes that my little girl would be okay.  Our birthing center had asked that for the safety of our tiny girl that we limit our guests to only instate, local family members.  Of course we agreed, the health of our child being the most important thing!  Hank obviously, only thinking of himself, was livid!  He even had his mother, Grandma Lilly, call me to give me, while insanely pregnant, the biggest guilt trip, going on and on about how unfair it was that my parents along with Haley and Gary were allowed but Hank wasn‚Äôt even though he is the grandfather.  I explained the health concerns to which she replied ‚ÄúWell my son is far more healthy and clean than that nasty mother in law of yours!  He has every right to be there!‚Äù  I calmly disagreed and explained that our baby comes first.  She then says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt be surprised when you come home and his RB is parked in your driveway!  He told me he will be there for a month this time, just so he can help you get adjusted, isn‚Äôt that wonderful?‚Äù  I was dumbfounded yet again and in my super pregnant state firmly told her that he would not be welcome and in fact, he wasn‚Äôt allowed to visit for the first 8 weeks to give her time for vaccinations and to build her immune system.  I also informed her that John and I would have absolutely no problem calling the police and having him forcibly removed from our property because we were that serious about our daughter‚Äôs health.  She huffed, then got off the phone very quickly so that she could call Hank who happened to be with his brother, Beau.  Beau then proceeds to text John, basically telling him what an uneducated idiot he is because he went to school in the south (both of our states are considered southern), and that he will always be a failure and that he couldn‚Äôt wait for our family business to fail and for our family to be homeless.  During this time, Hank was also texting John, tag teaming the bullying with his brother.  John had enough and blocked them both, along with Grandma Lilly.  He asked that I do the same, which I gladly obliged.  

We gave birth to our tiny full term rainbow baby girl!  While she has had some breathing issues that she is actively being treated for, she is otherwise healthy and thriving!  John has yet to unblock his father and uncle, though he has since unblocked Grandma Lilly, keeping her just at arms length.  John has absolutely no intention of having a relationship with Hank again, let alone our children, unless Hank were to apologize not only to us but to his family and especially to Haley and Gary, and also coming clean about Haley never actually cheating on him.  Obviously, a narcissist never thinks they are in the wrong, so I honestly don‚Äôt think that will ever happen.  Hank has only attempted to call twice, which John can see on his phone when blocked calls come through and can also still receive voicemails from said blocked calls.  Hank left a super nasty voicemail threatening John to call ‚Äúor else‚Äù and demanding to see his granddaughter because it is ‚Äúhis right.‚Äù  John has yet to respond and doesn‚Äôt think he ever will.  Oh, and the cherry on top?  We just found out from other family members that Hank and ‚Äúfianc√©e‚Äù have decided to go their separate ways, and Hank has found another ‚Äúsoulmate.‚Äù  

So sorry for the long novel of a post. Are we the AH for exposing my father in law for the liar that he is, for not allowing him to meet our daughter, and also refusing him to have any sort of relationship with our son for fear he will hurt him the way he hurt John?

He‚Äôd walk the streets of his city, feeling like a ghost, observing the vibrant lives in the shops and restaurants but never quite feeling a part of them. The world, to him, was like a library full of beautiful books he‚Äôd forgotten how to read.

One chilly October evening, a small calico cat with one gold-orange paw began following him. It didn't meow; it just looked at him with intelligent, ancient-seeming eyes. Intrigued, he followed it down a forgotten alleyway to a dusty brick building he'd never noticed before. The cat slipped through a crack in the door. He hesitated at first, then pushed it open.

The inside wasn't empty. It was a wonderful, dusty mess - a whole kit and caboodle of forgotten things: stacks of old books, mismatched velvet chairs, lonely coffee mugs, and canvases that hummed with the ghosts of unfinished paintings. The calico cat was curled on a velvet cushion, and the air was filled with a low, calming purr that felt less like a sound and more like... a state of profound peace.

He spent the night there, and for the first time in years, he felt the gray recede. He picked up a piece of charcoal and began to sketch the sleeping cat.

He never found the owner of the building, but he knew he'd found its purpose.

Kitten's Caboodle wasn't just opened; it was discovered. It's a sanctuary for quiet, creative souls. The coffee machine in the place was tuned to hum at the same calming frequency as the calico's purr.

I've been dealing with this frustrating issue with my mug warmer lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and what I learned along the way. Maybe this can help someone else who's facing similar problems.

So, I got this portable mug warmer a few months ago because I was tired of my coffee getting cold while I work. At first, it worked great, but then it started acting up. Sometimes it wouldn't turn on, and other times it would shut off randomly. Super annoying, right?

After some research and testing, I discovered several common reasons why mug warmers might not work properly:

1. Power Connection Issues
The most basic problem is often the power source. Make sure the USB cord (if it's USB-powered) is firmly connected and not damaged. Also, check if you're using the right voltage adapter. Some mug warmers need specific power requirements to function correctly.

2. Surface Detection Problems
Many modern mug warmers have automatic sensors that only activate when they detect a mug. If your cup isn't making proper contact with the heating surface, it won't turn on. Sometimes, the bottom of your mug needs to be completely flat for the warmer to work properly.

3. Auto-Shutdown Feature
This one caught me off guard - many mug warmers have built-in safety features that shut them off after a certain time. I thought mine was broken, but it was just the auto-shutdown doing its thing.

After dealing with these issues, I decided to upgrade to a more reliable model I found on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). The difference has been night and day - no more cold coffee!

Here are some maintenance tips I've learned to keep your mug warmer working properly:

- Clean the heating surface regularly
- Check for loose connections
- Use mugs with flat bottoms
- Keep it away from water or spills
- Don't leave it plugged in 24/7

If you're still having issues with your current mug warmer and want something more reliable, I highly recommend checking out this model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer). It's been working perfectly for me for the past few weeks.

One last thing - don't forget to check your warranty if your mug warmer is relatively new. Sometimes what seems like a malfunction might be covered under warranty, and you could get a replacement.

What's your experience with mug warmers? Have you found any other solutions to keep them working properly? Let me know in the comments!",1,1759544877.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm begging you to help us. Your age, job, income, religious beliefs - whether you are a parent or not - are irrelevant. All of us will suffer if we continue down this path. 

I‚Äôm a school administrator who works in a program that has more resources than most. I am fortunate. My staff are fortunate. My students and families deserve the support we provide. The criminal lack of resources in our schools is absolutely critical, but there is something more that you need to know about what the UCP is doing. Despite all my resources and my power, I can‚Äôt protect my students from this government. 

This means more than a bad year for a few kids. This is lasting, significant destruction of our collective population. The students and you and me. 

I need the general public to understand what the UCP has done to education. Classroom size and complexity are huge issues that they inherited. What I need to do is tell you the things that the UCP didn‚Äôt inherit. The things being done to our children and to us. All I will say about salary is that MLAs have had a 119% increase in wages in the last 15 years, and teachers have accepted a 0% pay raise twice in order to maintain classroom funding grants. Grants that have been removed, along with public reporting of classroom sizes. 

I have to acknowledge the many issues with UCP governance that go beyond education. It feels like a horrible, overwhelming game of wack a mole: AISH, healthcare, incompetent spending, corruption, Indigenous rights, the LGBTQ+ community, our economy, the environment - and more still. 

I know that education is not the only urgent concern in our province. But please understand that education is the road that leads to all others. There are no health care workers, no CEOs, no small businesses, no farmers, no services, no progress and no protections without education. There are no teachers without education. 

I want to walk you through my days. I want you to see a first hand account of the repercussions and consequences of allowing the UCP to continue to destroy us. I want you to feel the urgency and fear that I feel because we need your help.

I want you to watch while I tell my teachers that we have to use hours of time we don‚Äôt have to comb through their books and remove them from their classrooms based on vague notions of ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and subjective views of ‚Äúsexually explicit‚Äù materials. Books that they read to anxious children in the comfy chair that they thrifted and made their partner set up with them over the weekend. Books that make a child feel safe, books that show them that their family is beautiful the way it is. Books that help them be brave, books that show them they‚Äôre not alone, books that help them respond to the unknown with curiosity and love rather than hatred and fear. Make no mistake, the fact that they walked it back (not enough) doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt try it again. Soon. They didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúclarify‚Äù - they changed it because they got caught. 

I want you to see our kids as they look at the shelves and see where a book they love used to be and hunch their shoulders as they walk to their desks. Subdued, silent and afraid of what will be taken away next. The book ban is just that - a ban. We must provide lists and answer questions, justify our educational choices to unqualified government appointees. The workload for this is immense and serves to exhaust us into compliance. It serves to sew distrust between us and the families we serve. The people that dedicate their lives to your children are painted as untrustworthy, incompetent pornography peddlers. 

We can no longer be trusted to select educational materials about sexual health. Instead, I must now spend hours filling out forms to apply for approval of resources that aren‚Äôt in the sparse and incomplete list provided by people who have never set foot into a classroom for non promotional purposes. 

I want you to sit with me while I tell a beautiful, vibrant, brave child that she must stay silent or be outed. Outed by me. The person who has always told her she matters and is safe with me. Watch her look away from me and tell me it‚Äôs ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Watch her stop coming by my office to have tea with me. Watch me lose her. 

I want you to watch me tell my staff that they have to deadname a child while they stare at the floor and prepare to harm a child because I told them they have to. I want you to watch them stumble over their words as they try to use ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù and ‚Äúfriend‚Äù - anything but the deadname. I want you to watch that child shrink away from them, now nameless. 

I want you to watch me sign the form that forces me to agree to make my families tell me that their daughter was assigned female at birth. If I don‚Äôt, none of my students can participate in athletics. Girls sports teams are already folding - low registration has resulted in significantly fewer female teams. No games, nothing. I want you to see the students that don‚Äôt bring the form back, don‚Äôt try out for volleyball, and don‚Äôt come to school at all that day. Watch them as they stay home for longer and longer. Watch as I desperately encourage them to hang on. Watch when I fail to reach them all. One is too many. 

I want you to watch grown adults narrow their eyes at a girls basketball game, obviously focusing on the athlete that looks too masculine to them. You need to know that people can report, in writing, if they think an athlete playing on a girls team was not born female. I want you to see her face turn red and tears roll down her cheeks. Watch her quit the team. Watch her begin to wear baggy clothes and skip lunch. I want you to watch how the adults who humiliated her make her hate herself. Watch me lose her, too. 

Watch my teachers stop laughing with each other. Watch them use their time together to quietly talk about finding ways around the policies. Watch them deflate as they see that there is no magic loop hole, no middle ground, no options. Watch them stare into the distance during professional development because they don‚Äôt have any room left to learn something new. Watch me adjust their schedules, watch me reallocate resources, watch me bring them coffee and focus on the little wins, watch me as they cry in my office. Watch me cry with them, and then lose them too.

Watch as I spend countless hours reading UCP policies, writing my own awful policies because I must. Watch as I try to track accountability and communicate changes, watch me monitor compliance and die inside every time I do. Watch me fall behind with the real work - connecting with vulnerable students, debriefing with staff after a hard day, calling a parent who‚Äôs seeking help, applying for grants and finding field trips, cheering on our basketball team and popping into classrooms. Watch as I get up early and work late into the evening, spending hours on the weekends trying to keep up. Watch me spend more and more time away from my family. 

I can‚Äôt sleep, I barely eat, and I‚Äôm far from the only one. Watch as I question my ability to continue doing the thing that I love so much. 

These are not experiences that are unique to me. In fact, I have more resources and support at my disposal than most administrators. I really thought that this would mean I could find a way to at least protect my little community of kids. I want so badly to somehow stop this. I can‚Äôt see any way to save my kids or my staff or myself. 

Teachers will burn out even faster. The profession will take too much from even the most dedicated educators. The quality of instruction in our classrooms will tank. Something has to give and it shouldn‚Äôt be our kids. It needs to be the people who refuse to stop hurting them. 

We‚Äôre hurting our children in real and lasting ways. This kind of damage is not temporary and has profound effects. These kids cannot grow into adults that form relationships, find work and become the next generation of people that make things better. We are failing them and in turn they will fail us when we need them. 

I don‚Äôt really know what all of you can do to stop this, either. I guess I‚Äôm hoping that if enough people really see how truly awful things are, they will understand and start talking, posting, calling, showing up at offices. I‚Äôm telling everyone I know and encouraging outraged families to contact their representatives. If enough of us sound the alarm over and over, and more national attention puts a spotlight on these monsters, maybe we can stop them. 

I‚Äôm begging you to try.

I've been advised to trial a low carbohydrate diet to see if it helps digestive issues I've had.  

I will be consulting a dietician but having realized the milk and sugar in  my daily coffees and teas is over 25g of carbs I thought I would ask here for some suggestions.

I have found Allulose at Woolworths which will hopefully solve the sugar substitute issue.  Will be buying some next week.  An advantage of this is that unlike the sugar alcohols this won't have a negative effect on my SIBO.

As for a milk substitute / creamer for coffee and tea  I tried an unsweetened Soy milk (Vitasoy) but it gave the coffee and tea a weird taste.

Is there a milk or creamer that has a creamy neutral taste?  

I understand some people use double cream?  But I'd prefer something I can pour if possible.  Having had Gall Bladder surgery I have to be careful regards to fat content as well.

Hydration is a cheat code for performance, mood, and presence. Try this test today: drink 20‚Äì30 oz on waking, another 20‚Äì30 oz by lunch, then tell me your brain isn‚Äôt sharper and your body isn‚Äôt looser.

# What You Unlock When You‚Äôre Fully Hydrated

**Mental Edge**

* Sharper focus and memory
* Less brain fog
* Better decisions under pressure
* Calmer stress response

**Physical Output**

* More strength, endurance, and pump
* Faster recovery
* Fewer cramps, less joint irritation
* Better hormone regulation

**Sleep & Energy**

* Deeper sleep
* Easier wake-ups
* Stable energy across the day
* Fewer afternoon crashes

**Skin & Appearance**

* Clearer, tighter skin
* Less under-eye puff
* Healthier lips, hair, and nails
* Glowy instead of dry and dull

**Sexual Performance**

* Better blood flow and erection strength
* More stamina
* Improved sensitivity control
* Higher natural lubrication and output

**Internal Function**

* Smoother digestion and bowel movements
* Kidney and liver support
* Fewer infections from better fluid balance
* More efficient nutrient absorption

# Hydration Game: Cheat Codes

**1) Start With 20‚Äì30 oz on Waking**  
Before food or coffee. You wake up dehydrated by default. Rehydrating first flips your system back on.

**2) Add Minerals So Water Actually Absorbs**  
Pure water flushes. Water with minerals hydrates.  
Quick mix at home:

* 24‚Äì32 oz water
* Pinch of salt (Himalayan or sea)
* Squeeze of lemon or a splash of 100% juice
* Optional: a clean electrolyte packet

**3) Daily Target That Scales**

* Minimum: half your bodyweight in ounces
* Add 20 oz per hour of training
* Add 8‚Äì12 oz for each caffeinated drink
* Add 16 oz for each alcoholic drink

**4) Pair It With Habits**

* Before meals
* After peeing
* While scrolling
* Between sets

**5) Go Warm or Room Temp**  
Better absorption, smoother digestion, less bloat. Cold can slow digestion, especially in the morning.

**6) Watch Your Urine**

* Light yellow = on track
* Dark = behind
* Crystal clear all day = probably overdoing it

**7) Stack It With Your Supplements**

* L-citrulline feels stronger with solid hydration
* Beet powder flows better with water
* Zinc picolinate, magnesium glycinate, creatine all need water to move and do work
* Sleep and blood flow both depend on your hydration status

**8) Timing Rules**

* Morning: 20‚Äì30 oz with minerals
* Pre-workout: 12‚Äì20 oz in the 60‚Äì90 minutes before
* During training: sip, 6‚Äì12 oz every 15‚Äì20 minutes if sweaty
* Post-workout: 12‚Äì20 oz with minerals
* Evening: sip, don‚Äôt chug, to protect sleep

# Red Flags And Fixes

**Dehydration signs**  
Dry mouth, dark urine, headaches, low pump, brain fog, elevated resting heart rate.  
Fix: front-load water + minerals, steady sips, not last-minute chugs.

**Overdoing it**  
Crystal-clear urine all day, frequent nighttime trips, muscle weakness.  
Fix: add electrolytes, salt your meals, drink to plan not panic.

# Simple Daily Blueprint

* 20‚Äì30 oz on waking with minerals
* 32 oz during work or training
* 20‚Äì30 oz with lunch
* 12‚Äì20 oz post-workout
* Evening sips only

**Food boosters**  
Water-rich foods help too: cucumbers, oranges, melons, grapes, soups.

**Safety note**  
If you have kidney, heart, or electrolyte issues, talk to your clinician first.

# Tiny Tracker You Can Screenshot

* Waking 20‚Äì30 oz
* Pre-workout 12‚Äì20 oz
* During workout sips
* Post-workout 12‚Äì20 oz
* Lunch 20‚Äì30 oz
* Evening sips

**Snap!**

*Crackle‚Ä¶*

***POP!***

Si struggled to maintain her balance as she materialized. The change in air pressure wrecked her sinuses. She‚Äôd specifically requested not to be sent to a rainy day.

‚ÄúOh fae,‚Äù she swore, stumbling over to a fire hydrant and leaning on it for balance. Her stomach threatened to remind her of lunch.

She tugged her wristlet free of the leather jacket sleeve and activated the hologram display. No signal.

*Can‚Äôt trust cheap wizards,*¬†she thought, pinching the bridge of her nose.

‚ÄúHey, Clippy,‚Äù she said. The hologram shifted into a paperclip with lovely almond-shaped eyes.

‚ÄúGood day, Si!‚Äù it said in a sweet and husky voice.

‚ÄúFuckin‚Äô discount scrying didn‚Äôt foresee that I‚Äôm already in this timeline.‚Äù The short haired bluenette turned around to lean-sit on the fire hydrant. ""TimeJump protection spells kicked in and now I'm not sure when I am.""

‚ÄúMy apologies! I‚Äôll leave a two-star review on Yelp-powered-by-YahooTube.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you get me directions to Dee‚Äôs place?‚Äù Her girlfriend was always happy to see her stop in when she was in the area.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Clippy vanished and streamed data to Si‚Äôs contact lenses. She saw an arrow appear at the top of her vision and a blue line guided her down the sidewalk and around a corner. Ten minutes later she was on Dee's street and turned off the contacts‚Äô Heads-Up-Display, recognizing the apartment building. Same facade, fewer holographic displays. Gentrification had to be coming soon.

The front door opened with a quick tug of the handle and shove of the shoulder. No need to ring a buzzer and wait when maintenance never did its job. Elevator out-of-order; she had to climb six flights, nausea worsening with each step.

She slammed her fist three times against Dee‚Äôs door. It opened and Si was surprised that Dee was still a brunette.

‚ÄúUh, can I help you?‚Äù Dee asked, her eyebrows knit together.

‚ÄúYo, Dee‚Äù Si said, stepping past Dee. ‚ÄúSorry about the water, I‚Äôll mop it up in a minute. Got any Imodium? I was shunted from the TimeJump and feel like I'm gonna vomit."" She kicked off her wet sneakers inside and continued into the main room. ""Couldn't conjure any Tums on the way here, either.""

""You were... what?""

Si was midway through peeling off her soaked jeans as she looked around the apartment, stopping when she took in the decor. A floral-pattern couch? Static wall photos? Minifridge?

Looking at Dee again, and seeing her natural brown eyes and long hair pulled back in a sloppy bun, Si ran some numbers through her head as best she could while the other woman looked very shocked and flustered at Si's current position.

""You... work at the cafe, right?"" Si asked.

Dee shook her head. ""I, uh, work at Costco?""

""Oh,¬†*fae*!"" Dee yanked her pants up and hurried to the door. ""I'm so sorry! I got confused and-"" she slammed her foot into the corner of the wall. Another expletive was forming on her lips as she hunched forward from the pain, banging her head on the same wall.

Dee chuckled before reaching out and grabbing Si's arm, stopping her from toppling.

""Woah there, are you drunk or something?""

""No, I- uh, yes! Yes I'm drunk and I'm sorry, I mixed you up with someone else."" Her stomach lurched again as she stood up with Dee's help. She tried to excuse herself but bile rose, and she rushed to the bathroom.

\---

Thirty minutes later, Si lay on the scratchy floral sofa with an ice pack and hot tea.

""So, how do you know me?"" Dee asked, perched on the edge of the coffee table.

""Can't say. What year is it?""

""Twenty-Twenty-Five. I've read enough scifi to know that's a time-traveler question.""

""Not confirming nor denying.""

Dee puffed her cheeks, eyes narrowing. She reached for Si's wristlet, but the bluenette pulled it away.

""No touchy. No looky, either.""

""Fine, I'll just wait until you're asleep.""

""I'm not gonna fall asleep. I'm gonna wait for this headache to go away then leave.""

""You will. I put Benedryl in your tea.""

*Fae, I should have seen that coming.*¬†""But... that's..."" Si tried to find the words.

Dee shrugged. ""An uninvited intruder barges in, starts undressing, gets sick, and ruins my bathroom? Legally, I could do worse than give you sinus medicine.""

Si closed her eyes. ""I forgot how much of a bitch you were."" She yawned and felt Dee tug at the wristlet.

""Well it's about time.""",1,1759544272.0,ZLErikson,0,1.0,False
1nxi14r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1nxi14r/machine_only_works_after_rinsing/,Machine only works after rinsing,"Hi all, recently my nespresso stopped pulling water up so I gave it a deep clean and a rinse cycle and it worked for one cup of coffee and stopped pulling water again. When I rinsed it again the next day, it only gave me one cup of coffee and stopped pulling water. I‚Äôve tried all the hacks; blowing a straw in the gasket, the ziplock bag method, deep cleaning but still it will only work once and only after rinsing. As soon as I start the rinsing process it has no problem pulling water. Has anyone else experienced this, and how were you able to fix it? ",2,1759544235.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False
1nxi117,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1nxi117/kitten_extremely_lethargic_after_being/,Kitten extremely lethargic after being excessively licked by my dog.,"I left for about 10-20 minutes to get a coffee, upon returning my kitten was on my dogs bed covered in her saliva. My kitten is a little more than a month old, weighs 1.3 lbs, I dont know anything about cat breeds or if that even matters right now. I was obviously very scared for her and took her to the vet. I paid about 200 dollars for some dewormer and a flea topical, as well as the exam fee, Im not sure if that's a good price or not but also not the point of my post. The vet's advice was to make sure she eats and drinks and she'll be perfectly fine, outside of extenuating circumstances, like a disease the mom passed on or something. Anyway I get home, and she has drank a few times, but isnt touching her food. I'm giving her wet kitten food. Also im a bit worried the vet may have missed something, I was feeling her ribcage and it feels like 1 side is missing a rib, and when I scratch around that area she gets mad and bites me. To the vet's credit she is marginally more energetic and is walking around a bit again, but for the rest of the time I've had her she's been a super energetic kitten, so this is still not normal behavior.

To put it concisely, I'm wondering if I should be concerned about this potential missing rib the vet missed when I took her earlier today, or if she was missing a rib it would have been super obvious to them and I'm just overthinking everything. Thanks in advance.",0,1759544226.0,AskVet,3,0.5,False

1nxhztv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestPalmBeach/comments/1nxhztv/spanish_conversation_table_west_palm/,Spanish Conversation Table: West Palm,"Hey everyone! I recently moved here from Tampa, where there‚Äôs a Spanish conversation table that meets regularly. It‚Äôs a casual meetup at a coffee shop or brewery where people of all backgrounds and skill levels get together to practice Spanish. It‚Äôs super low-key, fun, and a nice way to keep the language sharp.

From what I can tell, West Palm doesn‚Äôt really have anything like this (closest I‚Äôve found is Boca Raton). I‚Äôm thinking about starting one here through Meetup, or maybe even an English‚ÄìSpanish language exchange, but I‚Äôd rather not be the only one footing the monthly fee. Ideally, I‚Äôd find a couple of others to help co-organize.

I‚Äôm a Spanish major and just want to keep my language skills sharp. If you‚Äôd be interested in co-organizing or just attending once it gets going, let me know!

You can have this basis po for any similar tour activities with your elderly families pero nakkapagod pala at stress hahah so i suggest na wag magiisa, better ung may kasama ka either prtner or siblings.
Very important: link your cc sa grab as in super convenient parang 100 euro lang talaga pinapalit ko all over the trip, 11k pesos lang din winithdraw ko for vietnam na sobra pa nga at naamze ako sa 500,000 vdn bill nila lols.
Tips( never book a ticket in advance due to weather issue as in) super lala ng froggy sa bana hills salubong with opong lols if inclement weather talaga i suggest na wag ng ituloy if super masyondara na as nakaka takot sa cable car esp kapag nastranded sa taas at super aatakihin ka talaga sa nerbyos . All activities can still be book on the spot  i booked bana hills, with alpine coaster (for me which is nd nagamit) 
Hotels are just normal ins ung sa bbk with breakfast kaso malayo layo ng very light sa city proper pero not an issue as still book lang ng grab.
Mnl-sin (8hrs layover) better advance booking for 2.5hr free tour online 
Sin-bbk (wat arun) nd nila trip mas trip nila mag mall mall
danang/hoian bana hills, my khe beach, hoi an old town, coffee shop hoppings,coconutj boat and lantern boat.
