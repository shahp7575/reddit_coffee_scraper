I've realized lately that the most enriching connections I've had weren't planned; they evolved from shared curiosities and a mutual appreciation for substance over noise.

I spend my days navigating deals and strategy, which offers its own intellectual satisfaction, but leaves little room for the kind of genuine exchange where you lose track of time. The kind where a discussion about literature seamlessly turns into philosophy, or where a simple coffee stretches into hours because the dialogue simply refuses to end.

I'm drawn to depth—someone who reads not just for leisure but for the pleasure of wrestling with ideas, who finds beauty in well-crafted language, and who values authenticity over pretense. If you're someone who appreciates nuance, enjoys exploring perspectives, and believes that meaningful connections are built through curiosity rather than curation, perhaps we'd find value in each other's company.

Not looking for anything prescribed. Just open to seeing where a genuine connection might lead—whether that's stimulating conversation, shared experiences, or something unexpected. If this resonates, I'd be glad to hear from you.",1,1766650405.0,gurgaon,0,1.0,False

I met this girl around 2022 but we were both in relationships at the time so nothing ever happened between us. We’d meet in anime conventions every year and all our conversations were just casual greetings. This year, she hopped on my dms and we started talking. We made a plan for a date/getting to know each other. During that date, we realized that or rather I realized that I wanted to get to know her, not as a friend but a potential girlfriend. We’ve gone on two more dates so far… the second one I asked for a kiss, she refused. I 💯% respect that coz I also like slow burns. 

She does go to work but I am unemployed so we don’t talk that much on text or call. Now this is why I think I should just give up on this girl.i made her a letter on the third date, the medieval inspired letters that are stained with coffee and crumpled up and burned around the edges to look old. I even tried to add a wax seal with flowers. I made an effort and took time to make it, she never told me how it was. She told me she was going o read it the next morning and that was the last time we ever spoke about that letter. I always initiate conversations or call first. Before the holidays, she intiated a call once. Most times if she was calling me it would be because I called her and she never received the call. Not responding to my messages, I get that she is busy… I understand completely but completely ignoring me and not responding is just… weird, right? There were times I’d find I have texted her like 4 times because of the conversation we were having and then I’d have to text again to say good morning or know how her day was.

 I realized that this was an issue and decided to pull back during the festive season and let her initiate the conversations. Last week, she used to call, which felt so nice because there was a bit of effort on her end at least. But this week, nothing. I texted her on Monday telling her good morning, she’s not even read the message till now let alone respond to it. I was thinking maybe today was going to be different since it is Christmas but she has not wished me a merry Christmas or anything of the sort.

That’s not even the issue, to hell with that. Even talking everyday is not the issue. I’d love it if she showed me that she thought about me every once in a while. Sending a song because she heard it and thought I’d like it, randomly asking how my day was and being concerned about how I am. For me it’s more about the effort.

1pv8dd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BedroomBuild/comments/1pv8dd3/why_do_certain_materials_resist_clumping/,Why do certain materials resist clumping?,"When you think about powders, grains, or even coffee, some materials just seem to flow perfectly while others turn into a stubborn lump fest. I’ve spent years experimenting with all sorts of powders, from protein supplements to industrial chemicals, and it all boils down to a few key physical properties.

**Surface Chemistry and Particle Shape**  
One of the biggest factors is the **surface chemistry** of the particles. Some materials have surfaces that naturally repel each other, making it hard for moisture or static to make them stick. Think of silica or cornstarch with anti-caking agents—they basically have a coating or a molecular structure that prevents them from linking up. Particle shape also matters. Round, uniform particles tend to slide past each other easily, while irregular or jagged shapes create friction points that trap moisture and cause clumps.

**Moisture and Environmental Factors**  
Even materials that normally flow well can clump under high humidity. The trick is that some powders **absorb moisture more slowly** or contain tiny spaces between particles that let air circulate. This stops the sticky bridges that usually form when water acts as a glue. Materials like rice flour or certain synthetic powders often resist clumping because their internal structure is porous or coated in a way that water just bounces off.

**Common Traits of Non-Clumping Materials**  
From my experience, powders that resist clumping tend to:

* Have **smooth, uniform particles** that reduce friction
* Be **hydrophobic or lightly coated** so moisture can’t make them stick
* Include **tiny anti-caking additives** or naturally porous surfaces that trap air

Honestly, once you start paying attention to particle size, shape, and how they interact with water and air, it all starts to make sense. Some materials are just built to flow while others fight it. Understanding these traits not only helps in the kitchen or at the lab but also explains why some products stay perfect in storage while others need constant shaking.

Materials that resist clumping are a mix of clever chemistry and smart physics, and knowing what makes them tick can save you a lot of headaches when handling powders.",1,1766649172.0,BedroomBuild,0,1.0,False

Although I’m still dialling in to get the perfect shot but everything, especially the workflow feels ‘elevated’ for lack of a better word.

Also, to the folks on the fence or looking to upgrade home setups, I really believe this or a Lelit Anna or a similarly priced machine would get you to coffee utopia and you do not need to spend more( or thereabouts in my very humble opinion). Some may argue that you can do it for much less than even what I spent and I’d agree there as well :).

I also learnt after still so many years with coffee equipment, that there’s a significant difference to what all we read, opine or understand from forums and ‘coffee influencers’. It makes a heck of a difference once you actually touch and feel these machines to understand how good ( or bad) they truly are.

Anyways, wanted to share the update and happy brewing all!

Also a big deal of respect for the Agaro. I know it gets a lot of trashing on the forum but I still think it’s a very capable machine when dialled in with a bottomless PF and in the right hands. I’ll be keeping it despite the upgrade.",6,1766649074.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

A few months ago I learned I was in afib 24/7. I was about to get a colonoscopy when they noticed it (and turned me down for the colonoscopy!). It was asymptomatic, I didn't notice anything but once I was made aware I realized my heartrate was really high all the time.

After getting in to see a cardiologist, then prepping for the cardioversion, the day finally came on Tuesday. They put me out with propofol and zapped me back into normal sinus rhythm. I've been monitoring my heart since then with a Frontier X Plus and it's constantly in normal sinus rhythm! My resting heart rate is back down into the 60s.

It's pretty crazy being in normal rhythm all the time, I keep waiting for it to get wonky again but so far so good. I'm on metropol, Flecainide, and Xarelto. I'm continuing to drink coffee, but in moderation. The goal is to eventually not be on any drugs at all. I'm cautiously optimistic.

My brother is 25 and I'm 22F and the favoritism has been obvious our whole lives. He can do no wrong while I'm constantly criticized.

He dropped out of college twice and moved back home and they welcomed him with open arms. When I wanted to take a gap year before college they said I was being lazy and irresponsible.

He works part-time at a coffee shop and lives with our parents rent-free. They praise him constantly for ""finding himself"" and ""taking his time."" I have a full-time job in my field and live independently and they barely acknowledge it.

Last week was the final straw. My brother asked for $5000 to buy a motorcycle and they gave it to him no questions asked. Three months ago I asked to borrow $1500 for a security deposit on a better apartment and they said no because I ""need to learn financial responsibility.""

I'm not even asking to be the favorite. I just want to be treated equally. But it's like nothing I do will ever be good enough compared to their golden child son.

We’d been travelling since 6pm the night before so we’re very happy as knackered. Unpacked and had a coffee.

Put valuables in safe. We were nipping to Walt’s for dinner, one ride and back to hotel for sleep.

Got back to room at 18:00.

I couldn’t find my meds, which had been in a clear bag next to my wash bag on the table.

Took the ones I had in my handbag & went to bed.

Woke up this morning at 06:30 & while the kids opened their stockings I went through everything. No sign, just the clear plastic bag the meds had been in.

Housekeeping had been in during the afternoon as the bin was emptied and had been put back under the table.

Reported to hotel management who advised I have to call 112 to have a doctor prescribe for me.

Then concierge will drive me to a pharmacy and the hotel will cover prescription costs. We can’t do that until tomorrow as pharmacies are closed and the nearest open is an hours drive away.

Absolutely fuming and feel violated. But it’s Christmas and I won’t/can’t let it affect our trip.

We’re here until Saturday and I have enough meds for today, I have severe arthritis and I can’t function without my meds.

I want to file a police report but don’t want to waste time we should be having in the parks. Does anyone know the best way to do it? Google tells me to do it online but when I tried I still have to attend a police station and to show ID etc.

In future, put EVERYTHING you can’t manage without in the safe. We shouldn’t have to but clearly the staff cannot be trusted. Feeling like it’s my fault but I didn’t ever consider that housekeeping would steal from us.

I am 30 years old male from central europe. Was an weekend alcohol abuser as well as a moderate smoker and a bit overweight with 110 kg (240lbs) at 182 cm (6 ft.) height.

Since I got my results in June I started exercising more (I was exercising before, just not regularly) and lost quite a bit of weight (am at 210 lbs). Stopped drinking completely (I drank 3 times, a glass of wine and a shot of liquor because of a special occasion!) and my smoking is barely on occasional as I smoke 5 cigarettes per month. 

I also started to diet quite hard (regular fish, only whole wheat bread, pasta, rice, more meals throughout the day, more vegetables (I barely ate them before this year) and less sugar drinks (almost none actually, only water) but 1 week before these tests I actually enjoyed myself and my family with some fast food (McDonald's). 

I have one addiction that I'll probably never get over. Coffee. 2 per day. Half a teaspoon of sugar. That's that. 

I'm also stressed a lot. I actually believe that my cholesterol levels are 95% from stress.

I did not move more than I had to over the 14 days before the tests as I've gotten sick as hell from the flu that's raging around.

These are my results from June and yesterday:

**Total cholesterol**

* June - **205 mg/dL**
* December -  **244 mg/dL**

**LDL cholesterol**

* June - **139 mg/dL**
* December - **193 mg/dL**

**HDL cholesterol**

* June - **35 mg/dL**
* December -  **39 mg/dL**

**Triglycerides**

* June - **204 mg/dL**
* December - **71 mg/dL**

I am super proud of my triglycerides improvement! But shocked at my cholesterol!! Statins are an option or maybe even a must but I'd try with biostatins first or if anyone has anything else in mind?",3,1766647585.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False
1pv7zb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaBusiness/comments/1pv7zb9/seeking_guidance_from_fmcg_founders_earlystage/,Seeking guidance from FMCG founders: Early-stage beverage brand– what should I focus on next?,"Hi everyone,
I’m an early-stage founder working on an FMCG beverage product. It’s a coffee-like drink made from roasted date seeds (naturally caffeine-free). I’ve recently completed the basic compliance side (FSSAI registration, GST), finalized packaging design, and done small trial batches.
At this stage, I’m a bit stuck on what deserves maximum focus next, and I’d really value guidance from people who’ve worked in FMCG, food & beverage, or D2C brands.
Some specific areas where I’d appreciate advice:

Validating real customer demand beyond friends/family
Whether to push offline retail first vs online (Instagram, marketplaces, own site)
Pricing strategy for a new, unfamiliar product
Marketing mistakes to avoid in early FMCG launches
How much to invest in branding vs distribution at this stage
How can i market my product.

I’m operating with a very lean budget and learning everything hands-on, so practical, experience-based advice would help a lot.
If you’ve built, worked with, or closely observed an FMCG brand—especially beverages—I’d love to learn from your experience.
I am in serious need of advice and connection.
Thanks in advance.",1,1766647562.0,IndiaBusiness,2,1.0,False

I have been feeling back to normal almost. I traveled to vegas recently, I can work out daily again and eat almost everything. 

I said I wouldn’t post here until I could start to live normal again w the foods and working out, traveling etc. I posted here two years in but was still on the diet and couldn’t workout and was having many flare ups trying to be normal. I can now run even with no fatigue after or days after. I thought I would never get here. I missed working out so much. 

Yes, I had every symptom. I was housebound for 2 1/2 years. I had a big flare up that set me months back. I had congestion in my chest again from a breathing test that sent me into a panic attack and somehow re started some of my symptoms. I really think they just weren’t all gone. 

Try D hist for the histamine. Time, d hist and quarticen helped a lot. With being on the diet strict at first and just staying home. No stress or that would cause flare ups. I work from home so I took my time as much I could during these long past 3 years. The d hist I wish I would have started taking a lot more daily.  I waited because I thought it wasn’t working but then my husband started taking it for allergies and his went away completely. So I started taking more and noticed I could eat more foods. I now take it weekly still. 

I say the 10% is still because I can’t drink alcohol or coffee still and I’m afraid of still doing too much. When I have coffee it just is too strong for me but no rashes or panicking feeling anymore. Alcohol I’m just afraid with so I have sipped it.  No rashes but I’m just worried with it and not so confident about it flaring me up. I guess the 10% is still my lack of confidence with being sick these past 3 years. Other than that I’m feeling really good besides some really low inflammation after that time of the month.

She's a coffee drinker (and I'm not), and she asked me if I could buy her a coffee. I said yes, but I reminded her that not many shops will be open on Christmas day, and that she should try and find out what's open.

She proceeded to look at Google to see what might be open, and she found a coffee shop near where I was going to pick up lunch from. I asked her to do me a favour to double check that her choice of coffee shop was definitely open, and if she could give me a backup option in case her first choice was closed. She tried to call her first choice of coffee shop to confirm if they were open, but they didn't answer. But she told me that their Instagram page said they were open. Because of this uncertainty, I asked her what her backup option was. She told me that she didn't have a backup, as she was very certain that her first choice was open. I accepted this, placed our lunch order, and drove off to pick it all up.

I parked the car and walked to the coffee shop, and when I got there the lights were off, nobody was inside, the door was locked, and the sign said 'closed'. Because she didn't have a backup, I called her to tell her that her choice of coffee shop was closed, and asked her what she'd like me to do. She asked me if I could walk around the street and try to find an open coffee shop. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I told her I don't really know where all the coffee shops are. And I didn't really have a lot of time to walk around looking for coffee when I have a lunch order to pick up shortly. She asked me if I could go to McDonald's drive through and get her a coffee from there. I was hesitant because I would have to walk back to the car, deal with a particularly hopeless McDonald's, and then come back, park the car, and walk to pick up lunch. She sensed my hesitation, and she said not worry about it. So I walked off and picked up lunch, then drove back home with it.

When I got back home with lunch, I could sense she was upset about something, so I asked her what the matter was. She said that she was very upset that I didn't get her a coffee, and that she didn't understand why it was so difficult for me to get one from McDonald's.

I told her that I could have gotten her a coffee from her second choice, if she had provided a second choice. And I told her that I was doing her a favour by buying her a coffee in the first place, and that it would have been helpful for her to meet me halfway by providing a second option. She then said that she doesn't think I was doing her favour at all, and I found that hurtful.

So my wife is very upset with me because she thinks I didn't go to enough effort to get her a coffee. And I'm hurt because she doesn't see me buying her a coffee as doing her a favour.

I so wanted it removed for the holidays and I really thought I had no worries with the very minor procedure. 

I had no food, no water. I smoke medical mj so I had some before I got on the bus to head over to centre.. Had a coffee and a cigarette before the appointment. I know all that sounds stupid in hindsight I don’t take real good care of myself though. 😕 

I went in. Laid on the table not fully I guess I had a bit of anxiety I always do.. I was trying to do breathing exercise then doctor came in. Said to lay down be calm. Said he’ll put in some anethestic so he put 2 needles in my cheek. Put some paper over my face with a hole out for the lump to be removed.. 

Tried 3 times testing with a scalpel and asked me each time ‘sharp or blunt’ I said sharp each time and on the 3rd he said okay we’ll have to put another needle in.

That’s when I felt my stomach and body change. I started feeling fuzzy tingly. Cold and hot, burst of hyperventilation.. sweating excessively and I had to sit up I grabbed his arm and said I’m going to pass out. He said to wiggle my toes. As I wasn’t 100% focused he leaned in front of my face and said my name and said ‘wiggle your toes’ it’ll help relive the symptoms. 

I then threw up. Had to lay down for 10 minutes he said he couldn’t operate as if he did again it would make me feel worse and then proceeded to go make a referral to a plastic surgeon specialist to put me under a ‘light sedation’ 

I just feel ashamed, defeated by myself. Idk I just wanted it removed. I feel upset man. 

And it is hurting now it wasn’t before also even today on Christmas it is now a tiny bit larger and it has a sort of slight pain in it. It didn’t hurt before and was a touch smaller not so noticeable. Now a bit more prominent sort of hurts to the touch. 😔

Merry Christmas 🎁. I hope you ladies are having a wonderful Christmas eve. 

I’m writing this because I’m sitting in my apartment today feeling a bit heavy-hearted, and I figured some of you might understand the feeling.

I moved to a new city about a year ago with my husband. Honestly, he is wonderful. He is truly my best friend, and we have a great time together. But lately, I’ve realized that a husband, even a great one, can’t be your everything. There is a specific kind of energy and connection you only get from girl friends, and I miss it so much it hurts.

Back home, I had my ""people."" I had friends I could text at the last minute to grab a coffee or just vent to about things that only another woman really gets. Now, my social life is mostly just my husband and small talk with coworkers.

We don't have kids, which usually suits us perfectly, but it feels like it makes making friends harder at this age. It seems like everyone around me is busy with toddlers or school events, and their social lives are totally built around other parents. I feel like I’m standing on the outside looking in.

I’ve tried a few things to meet people. I’ve gone to some meetups and joined a local book club, but nothing has really ""clicked"" into a real, deep friendship yet. It is so exhausting to always be the one trying to start the conversation or being the first to reach out.

1pv7nkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pv7nkq/am_i_the_asshole_for_wanting_to_give_up_on/,Am I the asshole for wanting to give up on helping my mam with her drinking,"Hello Reddit, I kinda want to used this post to help me vent and get some frustration out. So I am 22f and I am currently celebrating Christmas at my mams house, just some information about my family I am the youngest of four siblings , I have a sister and two brothers. My sister and my oldest brother live with my mam while my other brother and myself both live away, I am still in my hometown but my other brother is living a two hour train ride away because he is in care, he has autism. My oldest brother is also autistic but he is mild compared to my other brother and my sister has her own mental and health issues that I’m not fully sure about. 

Every since I can remember my mam has been fond of the drink, I remember finishing a day in school and I would go meet her and we would go straight to a pub and stay their for a couple of hours till I get her to go shops and do the weekly shopping, and when I got to secondary school I would meet her in the pub since I would be out an hour later. I remember I once came to school after having a big fight with my mam that morning, she was still drunk from the night before. I told some teachers what happened and told them not to say a word to her, she found out and go drunk that night again. I then started going to therapy and since I was underage at the time the therapist did have to meet my mam and talk to her about the issues I was having, my mam then used that as an excuse to get drunk again. I got used to finding my mam drunk near the end of the week every week but when something would happen with school or the family, it would get used as an excuse to go heavy with the drinking.

I am now currently dealing with the effect of dealing with my drunk mam which turned into a two hour challenge to calm her down, she was banging on the walls and smash stuff in her room, my sister started dealing with my mam first as I fell asleep earlier the night before my mam started drinking, I woke up to a shouting match between my mam and my sister. I then got call by my sister to help with my mam and I will be honest I ended up treating my mam like a child, I had to use a calm voice like I was consoling a child and let her cry it out, but every time I left the room after calming her down and I would her banging and shouting again. I told my mam I would make her a tea to hope it might sober her up even a tiny bit and when I went to make it I heard her shouting all over again. I then had to deal with my mam neighbour so isn’t a nice man at all and told me he would call the guards. Lucky I got him to go back into his house. A big moment that happened is my mam got a broom and started banging on the walls and I ran to her room and grabbed the broom. She was still holding on to it but I was holding it in place so she could stop banging the walls, my sister came down to the room and grabbed the broom of my mam and my mam fell and hit her head off the bed frame, with that my mam and sister started shouting at each other again and my mam told my sister to leave and go back to her room. I stayed in the door way cause I couldn’t leave my mam by her self, my mam then started to scream continuously which cause the neighbour to bang on the door. I honest can’t remember how but I got her into her bed after that and my mam asked for a coffee so I made her one. About 20 minutes my mam then came downstairs to the sitting room where myself and my boyfriend are sleeping in and I then gave her one of her present cause she kept saying she felt embarrassed and sorry. I basically just acted nothing happened and it wasn’t a big deal cause honestly I was tried with dealing with this shit for so many years. 

If someone might have some advice for my to somehow deal with this issue, it would be helpful cause I spent to many years taking care of my drunk mam that I honestly just want to give up

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

$$VIDEO LOG - STATIC FEED NO AUDIO$$

**Visual Context:** The camera angle is fixed, high-angle, looking down into a cylindrical medical pod filled with amber suspension fluid. Inside lies the Subject. The biological damage is catastrophic; much of the lower torso and limbs are missing or stripped to the bone. However, the image is not still. A myriad of ""things""—silver, insect-like micro-manipulators—are moving at blinding speed over the remains. They blur into a shimmering haze of activity, weaving synthetic muscle and fusing black carbon-lattice to bone faster than the eye can track.

**Holographic Telemetry:** Floating above the pod is a large, translucent diagnostic screen. It displays a rotating 3D schematic of the reconstruction. In the center of the wireframe chest cavity, pulsing in sync with the machines, is a small, perfectly round sphere of unknown material.

**System Readout (T-plus 17 Days):**

**The internal telemetry of the Autonomous Medical Unit told a story of impossible contradiction. Brain Activity was flatlined at zero**, yet **100%** integrity was preserved with optimal oxygen and nutrient flow. Connectivity to the Neural-Energy-Sphere Interface was at **65%**, while the catastrophic damage was being erased at blinding speed: bone replacement, utilizing Loridium Composite, was already at **85%**. 

The only flickering life was the meager **12%** external bypass circulation. Nano Shield Integration, remained at zero, waiting for the skin to be rebuilt. The system was 97% complete in constructing the **Virtual Resurrection World**

But the final, damning metric remained stubborn: **REBOOT PROCEDURE SUCCESS PROBABILITY: 0.0000%**. 

**Coda:** The video speeds up (Time-lapse x1000). The silver blur consumes the body, rebuilding it layer by layer. The sphere glows brighter. The camera zooms in on the probability metric at the bottom of the screen. For hours, it remains stubborn at zero. Then, a flicker. *0.0001%* *0.0004%* *0.0120%* The numbers beginning their increasingly faster, impossible climb.

**FRAGMENT 02: THE FORGE**

**Source:** Recovered Memory Core / Sector Zero (Undisclosed Location) **Date:** Estimated 3 Years Pre-Event **Subject:** REID, Georges / PROJECT SIBIL

The chamber was a lead-lined womb buried deep beneath the earth, alive with the deep, resonant groan of superconducting coils. The air didn't just shimmer; it distorted, warped by a localized heat of four thousand degrees Kelvin. In the center of this inferno stood Reid. He was stripped to the waist, his skin slick with sweat, his eyes hidden behind goggles that reflected a blinding violet light.

He had abandoned keyboards and code for something more primal. He wore heavy mechanical waldoes—gauntlets of steel and hydraulic prowess connected directly to a magnetic containment field. He looked less like a scientist and more like the mythic smith at his primordial anvil.

He pushed his hands together, and the waldoes screamed, hydraulics whining against the repulsion of fifty Tesla. Inside the field, a singularity of light fought back. He was forcing carbon and silicon atoms to fuse at the quantum level, folding space itself into a lattice structure. It was violent work. Sparks—actual cascading plasma—erupted from the containment ring, scarring the walls. Reid didn't flinch. With a primal grunt of exertion, he slammed the fields shut.

*CRACK.*

The light collapsed. The roar died instantly, replaced by a heavy silence smelling of ozone.

Floating in the center of the dampeners was a cube, small enough to fit in a hand. It was absolute black, drinking the light of the room. Reid collapsed back against the wall, chest heaving, burns red on his arms and torso. He reached out, tapping the air.

The dampening field shifted, guiding the artifact into a magnetic cradle linked to a holographic display. A beam of light erupted from the display. It did not scatter; it formed a perfect, high-fidelity standing wave. A woman appeared. She was made of photons, but her eyes held infinite depth. She looked at her hands, then down at the burned man on the floor.

She smiled. It was terrifyingly human.

**FRAGMENT 04: NEWSWORTHY**

**The GROTON Gazette / Police Blotter**

**Undated Clipping (Recovered from physical archives)** **Headline:** FLYING SUBS, ZOMBIE BILLIONAIRES, AND THE GOOD STUFF: A NORTH STONINGTON TUESDAY **By:** ""Skeptical"" Steve Maloney, Senior Crime Beat

Folks, I’ve seen some excuses in my time. I’ve heard ""the deer ran into my fist,"" and I’ve heard ""the wind blew the cocaine into my pocket officer, swear it."" But last night, local legend and unauthorized pharmaceutical enthusiast Jedediah ""Rusty"" Vance set a new gold standard for moving violations.

State Troopers clocked Vance’s rusted-out ‘22 Ford F-150 doing eighty-five down Route 2—which, for that truck, is basically reentry speed. When they pulled him over near the Casino turnoff, the cabin reportedly smelled like a distillery had exploded inside a hemp factory.

But it wasn't the substance abuse that made the night special. It was the story.

According to Vance, he wasn't fleeing the law. He was fleeing—and I quote—""A big black submarine that fell out of the sky and squashed my hay barn flat. The one we saw on TV in Pearl.""

You heard it here first. Not a UFO. Not a drone. A submarine. In North Stonington. Roughly ten miles from the nearest navigable water.

Vance claimed the vessel, which he described as ""sleek as a seal and quiet as a funeral,"" hovered over his north pasture, extended a landing leg, and ""sat down"" right on top of his winter feed. He then claimed a ""shiny metal man"" got out and asked him for directions to the Interstate.

Naturally, our finest decided to humor the gentleman and drove out to the farm. Did they find a nuclear vessel parked next to the tractor? No. Did they find a ""metal man""? No.

What they *did* find was a haystack that had been... well, ""pulverized"" is the word the Sergeant used. Scattered, like by a small tornado. The Official Police Report lists the cause as a ""Localized Micro-Weather Event"" (which is cop-speak for ""We have no idea, but we aren't writing 'Flying Submarine' on a government form"").

Vance was released this morning with a suspended license and a stern suggestion to switch to light beer.

**IN OTHER NEWS: THE ELVIS SIGHTINGS ARE SO 20th CENTURY**

As if the flying boats weren't enough, we also have our first confirmed sighting of the ""Ghost of the Pacific.""

Bar patrons at *The Broken Keel* in New London reported a visitor around 2:00 AM. Descriptions vary, but three witnesses swore it was none other than Georges Reid, the tech billionaire who tragically (and famously) died saving a sub in the Pacific last month. You know, the one we have no real picture of?

Apparently, the Zombie Billionaire has excellent taste. He ordered a Narragansett, paid with a crisp hundred-dollar bill (which the bartender framed), and was remarkably polite.

""He didn't look like a dead guy,"" said Mary-Jo, a regular. ""He looked... shiny. Like he’d just been waxed.""

The kicker? Witnesses say ""Dead Reid"" didn't leave in a limo or a spaceship. He hopped onto a matte-black motorcycle that ""didn't make a sound"" and sped off toward the Navy base and the General Dynamics Electric Boat’s main shipyard.

So there you have it, Groton. We have flying submarines flattening farms and dead billionaires drinking lagers. I don't know what they're putting in the water supply these days, but if anyone sees Amelia Earhart drag-racing a tank down I-95 tonight, please call the news desk.

*Steve Maloney is the Gazette’s senior columnist. He prefers whiskey to flying submarines.*

a step I can’t backtrack,
a chapter I can’t erase.

We sealed it with a blessing.

I’m so hurt
and disappointed in myself.
How could I value my life so little,
take my respect for granted,
trade my peace for your chaos?
Now I’m writing epistles I’d never send,

because you hold all the cards.

You have all the power.
I don’t know where mine is.
I didn’t see it walk out.
I chose what I thought was potential.
I wore a veil by choice.

I look in the mirror and I don’t know her.
Whose eyes are those?
Is this misery mine?
Is this burden all mine to bear?
Why is the reality hitting me so hard?

I spent nine months alone,
the hallways I dragged myself through,
the terrifying doctors’ appointments.

Now dependence is smeared over my two-day sweatpants.
I’m running on coffee, sleep deprivation, and speed baths.
I’m living the best and most tired life.
I’ve never understood the word bittersweet till now.

I just want my independence back,
my life back,
my peace and sanity back,
and frankly, you out.

Your presence is no different than your absence.
If I’m alone in my journey, I’d rather be alone.
And I’d make these decisions if I had any power,
any means of determination.

But I’m broken in more ways than one.
Something happened on that table.
The old me left, and a new one was birthed,
and I don’t know this tired, chaotic, yet capable woman.

I have so much pain I can’t share,
so much loneliness I can’t even process.
And you know what? I’m mad.
It’s like I got run over by a truck and wasn’t asked how I’m feeling,
then had to get up and run a home on a broken leg.

I wish there was some doorway I could walk through
and it’d wake me up,
give me my fighting spirit back,
and I could shed you and go after what I need
to make my life whole.

No one tells you the pain of needing someone who disrespects you,
someone who ignores you,
someone who neglects you.

I would’ve like a Mother’s Day gift.
I would’ve like a birthday gift.
But you already pay bills, so those were my gift.
I’m appreciative,
very deeply so.

Then why am I so hurt?

 i for one think deciding to sleep separately is the best thing that happened to me and my gf. we first started doing it because we adopted another cat that didn't get along with the cat we already had and both of them are clingy and scream like bloody murder if they don't sleep in the same room as us so we both picked a cat to sleep in the same room as. we thought it was just for a while until the cats get along but surprise surprise they never did and on top of that we realised we sleep much better.

 I'm a snorer and my gf a light sleeper. i am an insomniac so at least once a week i toss and turn all night long (now that i sleep separately i can just get up and do my thing instead of trying to move quietly to not wake her up). when it's hot outside we don't create extra heat for the other. when it's cold we don't steal each other's blanket. we have enough space and don't have to worry about ending up on the middle of the bed and disturbing the other. we can set different alarms without waking each other up if we don't have to be up at the same time. i usually wake up earlier on the weekend and holidays and i can start my day and drink my coffee without waking her up.

I’ll be attending CES this year and I’m hoping to connect with US-based professionals in **Marketing, Software Development, and Industrial Design.**

I founded a team focused on the cross-border travel and mobile office space. Our mission is to build a brand that makes the ""work from anywhere"" lifestyle truly seamless and comfortable.

**A bit about us:**

* **Traction:** Our first product hit over **$1.5M in sales** in just its first year.
* **Team:** We achieved this with a team of only **2 people**.

I’m a big believer that with the rise of AI, we no longer need to rely on massive corporations. We now have the tools to build what we love, from wherever we choose.

**My Background:** Before this, I spent 6 years as an executive at One of the world's largest crowdfunding platform. I witnessed countless dreams come true for others, and now I decided it was time to chase my own.

If you’re passionate about the digital nomad lifestyle or building efficient hardware/software products, let’s grab a coffee at CES!",1,1766645268.0,CESLV,3,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for cuthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs*?*” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

**His** skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave. 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

It must have been about someone he liked. 

After all, she’d seen him smile like that many times before.. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 12 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

other. 

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel–a bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side. 

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same s versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University, 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened, 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them**,** Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weig of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe, every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical **suffering** was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvía had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvía, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me. 

“Then I will let you **go** and set myself free.” ",1,1766645165.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

“Life continues to melt into a dream
It feels lighter, less real
More on purpose and yet less purpose-full
The mystery lights the way

There was a time where I protected my path with ferocity and fire
And now the path seems to protect me
Gentle nudges and ‘no’s’
Closed doors, redirections
The Path has held brakes to my raging fire
Turning rivers of ash to liminal waters 

There was a time where I fought for what I knew was right 
A time where I gave it my all
Constantly learning, reading, meditating, praying, creating, trying, moving, moving, moving
Pushing
A time where giving up on dreams would have felt like certain death

Where never give up was a mantra
Spoken into cups of coffee
Late nights, early mornings
Cold plunges
Yoga 
Breath
Journaling
Identifying
Feeling
Healing
Walk it off
Push through
Keep it going
Never stop 

Now Life is leading
Where giving up is not an option, even more so than before
But giving up on my way, is now the only option
The Current has overtaken
And surrender has found me

How does one describe the infinite power of Existence itself taking control?
Before I had to fight to stay the course
Now I couldn’t get off this ride if I wanted to

From fighting the crashing force of the ocean
Steering at the helm of the ship
Breaking through each wave as it comes
Gripping with both hands, tight

To the waves ripping the helm from your hands
And the realization of the endless sea surrounding
Your legs shake, grip gone, no control
But your heart steadies, grounded into something larger

For the crumbling ship is no longer yours to guide
And you’re being guided by the relentless power of the ocean 
There is no other choice but to trust, just ride, wherever the current flows

You cannot possibly give up on your already effortless existence
To fall off this path is impossible
There is no need for fire 
When you are the sea”.

1pv7979,https://i.redd.it/xh6gchkcpa9g1.png,"Three Hearts, One Lie","Dozens of photos revealed the lie of my marriage—my husband Elton had built a second life with his mistress.

I pulled the drawer and then I saw an envelope. Inside it were photos. Dozens of them. Elton and Jennifer—his business partner.



I stood in stunned silence, the images falling like hammers against my chest.



Elton laughing, arm slung around Jennifer's shoulders. The two of them seated in a hotel suite, heads close together, their smiles easy.



One photo showed his hand resting low on her back as if it was muscle memory. They weren't posing. They were captured—casual, familiar, intimate.



My pulse throbbed in my ears as I reached for the next folder.



This one was labeled ""Personal – JF."" Jennifer Fowler.



Inside, I found printed emails, receipts, and notes.



""Thanks for last night.""



""Still thinking about Aspen.""



""Wish you were here.""



And a note scribbled in Elton's handwriting: ""You looked beautiful today."" Then another: ""Wish we didn't have to pretend.""



I blinked through tears but didn't let them fall.



My footsteps echoed as I left the study. The door closed behind me with a click that sounded too much like an ending.



An ending of our marriage.



——————



The clink of silver against porcelain echoed through the



spacious kitchen, louder than it should have in a house this grand. Jen Monroe-Woods stirred her tea slowly, eyes locked on the curl of steam rising like a soft question left unanswered. Across the marble island, Carter shoveled cereal into his mouth, blissfully unaware of the tension hanging between the countertops and ceilings—a tension that had become their quiet morning ritual.



""Elton already left?"" she asked, not looking up.



""Mmm-hmm,"" Carter mumbled between bites.



Jen swallowed, but the tea didn't help the lump in her throat. Of course he had.



She glanced at the oversized clock on the far wall—6:47 a.m. Too early for anything but avoidance. Lately, Elton seemed to favor that kind of silence: the kind that moved fast, never waited to be addressed, and left cold shadows in its place.



""He said he had a meeting downtown,"" Carter added, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.



Jen gave a tight smile. ""Of course he did.""



She turned back to her tea, watching the honey dissolve into amber spirals. It was always the little things that gave Elton away—the missed breakfasts, the clipped goodnights, the way he only looked at her when someone else was watching. The ring on her finger suddenly felt heavier, like it belonged to someone else's story.



""He said to remind you about the meeting with my teacher,"" Carter said, swinging his legs under the bar stool.



""I didn't forget,"" Jen said, ruffling his dark hair. ""I'll be there.""



Carter grinned. ""You always are.""



That tugged at something deep in her chest. Jen had always shown up—for every play, every recital, every nightmare that Elton slept through. She filled in the gaps her husband left behind like a shadow stretching to patch every crack in the walls. She was always there. Always holding it together. It wasn't always like this.



When they first met, Elton had pursued her with the kind of fervor that startled even her. He had called her fire and gold. Back then, she was Monroe—just Monroe. The heiress with sharp wit and a defiant heart. She had been the headline, the legacy, the name that turned heads at galas. And he had wanted her not despite her independence, but because of it.



Now, she wasn't sure he even saw her at all.



The hum of his absence filled every corner of their modern palace. His cologne lingered faintly in the hallway—sharp and expensive. The walk-in closet they once shared now felt like a curated museum of suits and silence. She couldn't remember the last time he'd ki-ssed her goodbye.



""Can I go play Switch before school?"" Carter asked, hopping off the stool.



""Fifteen minutes,"" she said. ""Then brush your teeth.""



He dashed off, and just like that, the silence returned. Jen sat alone with her tea, her untouched toast, and the hum of the refrigerator. Domestic sounds layered over the ache of loneliness like white noise trying to smother a scream.



She stood and wandered through the open-concept living space, her bare feet gliding across the cool hardwood floors. The walls were filled with art she hadn't chosen. The furniture had been approved by designers, not by her. Everything looked beautiful. Sleek. Curated. But it all felt like a display—a home dressed up to pretend.



Their wedding photo still sat on the mantel. Elton's smile in the picture was wide, warm, real. His hand wrapped protectively around her waist, like he knew she was the prize. She remembered that day. Remembered how he looked at her like she was both the beginning and the destination. Now, she couldn't even recall the last time he looked at her with anything but obligation.



A soft knock broke her daze.



She opened the front door to find Marina, their



housekeeper, holding a familiar white box. The scent hit Jen before Marina spoke.



""Mr. Woods called ahead,"" Marina said with a gentle smile. ""He wanted to make sure there was something sweet for Carter before his meeting.""



Pastries. From Carter's favorite French bakery downtown.



Jen forced a polite nod, even as something inside her twisted.



""Thank you,"" she murmured.



Marina disappeared down the hallway, and Jen placed the box on the counter like it was something fragile. Elton hadn't left a note. Hadn't texted. But he'd remembered the pastries.



He remembered Carter.



He just didn't remember her.



Later that morning, after dropping Carter at school, Jen drove aimlessly through the city. She passed polished skyscrapers and high-end boutiques, passed billboards advertising Elton's latest ventures. His name gleamed from steel and screen alike, proud and unreachable.



He was everywhere.



And somehow, nowhere.



Her car eventually pulled into a small cafe downtown. Not the kind of place she usually went to. It was modest, tucked between a bookstore and a florist, its front windows slightly fogged from the warmth inside. Jazz floated through the air as she stepped in. The chairs didn't match, and the mugs were chipped in charming places. It was real. It was quiet. It felt like a place untouched by her life.



She ordered a cappuccino and took a seat by the window.



The coffee was warm, comforting. Her hands cradled the cup as if holding onto something that wouldn't slip away. Her phone buzzed.



She glanced at Elton's shared calendar. It was how they coordinated Carter's school and family events. She knew better than to snoop. This wasn't snooping. This was survival.



9:00 AM – Meeting with Fowler.



Jennifer Fowler.



The name sat in her mind like a splinter.



It wasn't just suspicion. It wasn't jealousy.



It was intuition. Cold and certain.



She'd met Jennifer twice. Once at a gala, once at a business dinner Elton insisted she attend. Jennifer had been radiant. Poised. Her words calculated and clean. She was the kind of woman who never had to raise her voice to command a room. She wore control like a second skin.



And when Elton spoke to her, he lit up.



Jen had noticed.



He leaned in. He listened. He laughed—that low, deep laugh she hadn't heard in their kitchen in months.



She told herself it was nothing.



She told herself she was imagining it.



But in the silence of their home, in the tiny cracks of their conversations, she felt it growing—the space between them. The shift.



Something was happening.



Or maybe it already had.



Outside the cafe window, the city continued its buzz—taxi horns, people on phones, coffee in one hand and stress in the other. But all Jen could see was her reflection in the glass. A woman who once believed love would be enough.



She wasn't so sure anymore.



Behind her husband's shadow, another woman stood. And Jen was finally starting to see her clearly.



The morning sun filtered through the tall kitchen



windows, soft and golden, casting a warm glow over the pristine marble counters and the untouched croissants between them. Everything looked perfect. Everything felt wrong.



Jen sat at the far end of the island, sipping lukewarm coffee she'd reheated twice. Across from her, Elton scrolled through his phone, the faint tap-tap of his thumb somehow louder than it should have been in the stillness between them.



She watched him over the rim of her cup. His



face—handsome, sharp, familiar—was locked in the same unreadable expression he wore in boardrooms. Not tired. Not irritated. Just... distant. Elsewhere.



""So,"" she said softly, carefully, ""Carter's meeting went well yesterday. Mrs. Langford said he's improving in math.""



Elton nodded, eyes still on the screen. ""That's good."" ""That's all you're going to say?""



He looked up briefly, his brow slightly furrowed as if she'd spoken a foreign language. ""What else is there to say?""



Jen stared at her plate. She hadn't taken a single bite. The croissants were flaking perfectly, untouched, uneaten.



This was what breakfast had become—two people sitting across from each other with more space between them than the length of a table. Conversation was sparse, clipped, functional. Like coworkers. Or worse, strangers.



She reached for the butter dish, more for something to do than because she was hungry. ""He misses you, you know.""



Elton finally looked at her again, a flicker of guilt or surprise in his eyes. ""I've been busy. There's a lot going on at the firm.""



""There's always a lot going on at the firm,"" she said, spreading the butter with deliberate care. Her tone wasn't accusatory. Not yet. Just tired.



A pause stretched between them, thicker than silence. He set his phone down and picked up his espresso, took a sip, and still avoided her gaze.



""I'll make time this weekend,"" he said.



Jen nodded. She knew the script by heart now. The same promise made week after week, always broken by some emergency, some call, some dinner with partners. Time with him had become a luxury she could no longer afford to believe in.



She took a bite of toast she didn't want, chewing without tasting. Everything in her life had started to feel like that—empty calories. Things she went through the motions of.



""You're quiet,"" Elton said suddenly.



Jen looked up, arching a brow. ""I could say the same about you.""



He didn't respond. He just picked up his phone again.



She studied him. The way he sat, poised and polished even on mornings like this. The crispness of his shirt. The absence in his eyes. There was a time when this man had made her feel like she was the most captivating thing in a room. Now, he barely saw her.



""How's Jennifer?"" she asked.



It slipped out before she could stop it.



He froze, just slightly. A hesitation so small it would be invisible to anyone else. But not to her.



""She's fine. Why?""



""You've been spending a lot of time with her lately.""



""She's my business partner.""



""I know.""



Her voice was calm, but it chilled the air. He looked up slowly, eyes searching hers.



""What are you implying?""



Jen met his gaze evenly. ""Nothing. Just making conversation.""



The tension in the room crystallized. A silence that wasn't passive but purposeful.



He pushed his plate away, still untouched. ""I have an early call.""



Of course he did.



He stood, gathering his phone, sliding on his watch with practiced ease. Jen didn't move.



""Elton.""



He paused at the doorway, turning halfway.



She looked at him then—really looked. Eight years of marriage. A son. A life they built brick by brick. And still, it felt like he was slipping away with each passing day. He was the same man in appearance, but something vital had vanished.



""When did we start eating breakfast like strangers?""



He didn't answer right away. His jaw flexed, his gaze shifting toward the window.



""I don't know,"" he said finally. ""Maybe when we stopped having anything to say.""



Then he left.



And the silence he left behind roared louder than any argument ever could.



Jen sat there, motionless, staring at the steam rising from his coffee cup. It hadn't even cooled yet. She reached for the butter knife again but stopped when she noticed her hand trembling. She set it down gently.



After a moment, she rose and walked toward the window. The garden shimmered outside, morning dew catching sunlight on the rose petals she used to trim every weekend. Before Carter. Before Elton became a brand more than a man. Before everything started feeling like performance art.



She pressed her hand against the glass, remembering when things were simple. When love was loud, spontaneous, and impossible to ignore.



She thought of all the things she wanted to say:



I miss you.



I miss us.



I feel like I'm disappearing, and you don't even notice. But what would be the point?



He wouldn't hear her.



He hadn't for a long time.



And maybe that was the most painful truth of all. Not the silences. Not the suspicions. Not even the lies she hadn't caught him in yet.



It was this: waking up beside someone you used to love with every inch of your heart—and realizing they had become a stranger in the seat across the table.



Jennifer Fowler adjusted the cuffs of her cream silk



blouse, the subtle shimmer catching the light as she stepped into the conference room. Her heels clicked with a rhythm that announced authority without apology. Behind her, a young assistant trailed with a tablet in hand, already spouting numbers and timelines, but Jennifer only half-listened.



The room buzzed—interns whispered, junior execs reviewed notes with nervous fingers, and the scent of espresso and polished ambition floated through the air. She liked this room. The glass walls opened up to a skyline that made even the proudest feel small. It was humbling, in the way power should be. But the seat at the head of the table reminded her who was in charge today.



Not Elton.



Her.



She smoothed her skirt and took her place without hesitation.



""Elton will be joining us shortly,"" she said, her tone clipped and professional. Calm. Collected. In control.



A few years ago, she'd have been taking notes at this table. A few years before that, fetching coffee. But now, her presence commanded attention. The name Fowler didn't come from old money or family legacy. She had built it—deal by deal, late night by late night, one overlooked pitch at a time. Every triumph was a rebuttal to the underestimation she'd endured.



And now, she shared the empire with Elton Woods.



And his secrets.



As the assistant launched into quarterly figures, Jennifer only half-listened. Her mind was elsewhere, tracking time. He was late. Again. She didn't glance at her watch, but the seconds pressed against her chest.



He used to be early. Always. Leaning against the glass door, teasing her with that grin—that da-mn confident, deliberate grin that made her forget where they were. Now his smiles were rarer, his excuses longer.



But she never showed it.



Jennifer Fowler did not flinch. She did not beg.



Even when she cared.



God help her, she cared.



The door opened. Elton entered, suit sharp, hair immaculate, posture perfect. The room seemed to tilt toward him, like gravity bent for power. He moved with ease, and he smiled that charming, calculated smile.



""Apologies,"" he said, sliding into the seat beside her. ""School drop-off ran long.""



Her stomach coiled. School. Carter. That meant Jen.



""Of course,"" Jennifer replied smoothly, masking her disappointment with a neutral nod. ""Shall we begin?""



As the meeting resumed, she shifted only slightly, watching him from the corner of her eye. The way he tapped his pen when he disagreed. The subtle shift of his jaw when he didn't trust a number. She had memorized him. Not just professionally. Intimately.



But there was still one version of him she didn't know—the man who went home to his wife.



After the meeting, the others filtered out. Jennifer lingered, packing up slowly, careful not to seem like she was waiting.



""You looked tired today,"" she said softly, not looking at him.



""Didn't sleep much,"" he replied, gathering his notes. She hesitated. ""Because of her?""



His jaw tensed. Then relaxed. ""Don't, Jen.""



Jen. Not Fowler. Not Jennifer. Just Jen. It made her feel like more and less at the same time.



She turned away, gathering her things with practiced calm. ""The Zurich deal needs press clearance by next week. We'll lose momentum if we delay.""



""I know,"" he said. ""I trust you.""



Trust. She had earned that word. She had bled for it. But hearing it now, when she was nothing more than the in-between, felt like salt on an open wound.



She looked at him, really looked. ""Do you ever think about how this looks from the outside?""



He didn't answer.



""We've talked about this,"" he said eventually.



""No,"" she replied. ""You've explained it. That's not the same.""



A long pause.



""Jen is your wife,"" she continued. ""You raise a son with her. I just... exist around that. In the shadows. In the leftover hours.""



He stood and walked toward the window, hands in his pockets. ""You knew the situation.""



""I did,"" she said, barely audible. ""I just didn't expect to feel like this.""



The confession hung between them, too heavy for the room. He didn't answer. His silence wasn't cruel, but it wasn't kind either. It was careful.



She adjusted her blouse, smoothing away emotion. Armor back on.



""I'm not asking you to make promises. Just... tell me where this is going.""



Still, nothing.



She nodded to herself, lips pressed tight.



""I'll send you the Zurich files by end of day,"" she said, tone sharp, efficient.



""Thanks,"" he replied.



That was it.



She walked out without looking back, her heels echoing through the corridor. As she passed the framed photo of Elton shaking hands with a public figure, she paused.



He smiled in that photo. That future-facing, camera-ready smile. The man who had everything.



Jennifer stared for a moment too long.



You knew what this was, she reminded herself. This is the cost.



Of ambition. Of pride. Of loving a man who would never be entirely hers.



And yet, in the quiet of her office later that night, long after everyone had gone home, Jennifer didn't feel like the mistress.



She felt like a woman slowly losing pieces of herself, one secret at a time.



The crystal chandelier above sparkled like frozen stars,



scattering light in elegant shards across the ballroom. Laughter mingled with the clinking of champagne flutes, and the string quartet in the corner played a piece that was both elegant and forgettable. Waiters glided between guests, balancing silver trays of delicate hors d'oeuvres, and smiles were painted on like masks.



Jen Monroe-Woods stood beside Elton, her hand resting lightly on his arm—the way a good wife's should. Her smile was effortless, her nods polite, her laughter well-timed. She played the part like she was born for it.



In many ways, she was.



""Elton,"" a colleague said, clapping him on the shoulder, ""you really do clean up well. And Jen, stunning as always. How do you keep him grounded with all that power?""



Jen smiled with just the right amount of charm. ""Oh, I just remind him who really signs the checks.""



Polite laughter rippled around them.



Elton chuckled, brushing his hand briefly against hers in a gesture that looked affectionate. To everyone watching, they were the night's golden couple—wealthy, polished, enviable. Perfect.



But Jen felt like she was watching herself through glass.



Every compliment, every toast to their success, felt like it was aimed at a version of her that no longer existed. Her dress was custom-tailored, her makeup flawless, her diamonds catching the light. But none of it reached her eyes.



""Excuse me,"" she said softly, and slipped away.



In the ladies' room, she leaned against the marble sink and stared at her reflection. She touched the corner of her eye, trying to smooth a fine line that hadn't been there last year. Her lipstick remained perfect, her earrings sparkled.



She looked like a woman who had everything.



She felt like a woman who was slowly becoming nothing.



The door creaked open behind her. Two women entered, chatting in hushed tones. They didn't see her at first. ""I swear, they barely looked at each other during the fundraiser last month,"" one whispered. ""But tonight? He's pouring her champagne like they're on their honeymoon.""



""Maybe they're just good at keeping things private,"" the other replied. ""Still... have you seen how often he's with that new partner of his? Jennifer Fowler?""



Jen didn't move. She didn't breathe. ""Gorgeous woman. Smart, too. Some say she's the one who really drives the business.""



""Some say a little more than that.""



Their voices faded as they entered a stall, and Jen exhaled shakily. Her chest felt tight. Her reflection stared back at her, unreadable.



She returned to the ballroom, her smile restored like armor. Elton stood near a pair of investors, deep in animated conversation. His eyes lit up as he spoke, his laughter easy and confident.



He turned as she approached and placed a hand at the small of her back—another show of affection for the room.



""There you are,"" he said, his voice smooth. ""Everything alright?""



""Of course,"" she replied, looping her arm through his. She leaned in and murmured, her smile sharp and cold, ""You're very good at this.""



""At what?""



""Pretending."" He didn't flinch. His hand remained exactly where it was. But his silence gave him away.



""You wanted to come tonight,"" he said quietly, keeping his gaze forward.



""I wanted us to come tonight."" Still, he said nothing.



Someone called for a toast.



""To power couples!"" a voice rang out.



Glasses raised. Smiles widened.



Jen lifted hers and smiled too—crystalline, fragile, unbreakable until it wasn't.



After the toast, they circled the room again, smiling and shaking hands. Every few minutes, Elton's arm would graze hers. His laugh would echo a little louder when she spoke. The performance continued.



Then she saw it.



A flicker in his gaze. A glance over her shoulder.



She followed it.



Jennifer Fowler stood on the other side of the room, radiant in a sleek black dress, surrounded by a group of executives. She wasn't trying. She didn't have to. She belonged.



Jennifer's eyes met hers for just a heartbeat. No smile. No nod. Just a glance heavy with unspoken truths.



Jen looked away.



""You okay?"" a voice said beside her. She turned. One of Elton's junior partners. Kind eyes. Harmless.



""I'm fine,"" she said, smiling. ""Just a little warm.""



But what she meant was: I'm fading, and no one notices. Not even him.



By the time the gala wound down, Jen's face hurt from smiling. Elton was still shaking hands, still turning on the charm. As always.



In the back of the car, Jen leaned her head against the window. The city lights blurred past, glowing and indifferent.



""You were quiet tonight,"" Elton said, glancing at his phone.



She turned her head slowly. ""Were you listening?""



He didn't answer.



And that silence—clean, polished, and absolute—told her everything she needed to know.

Just peace. 😌,"This is my first holiday break with no work the whole 2 weeks—20 Dec 25 to 04 Jan 26—in our new home na this year lang rin na turnover. All of the home owners/tenants in this condominium left for the holidays. Kami lang ng husband ko, our dog at yung guard sa lobby ang tao sa buong building na’to. Sobrang tahimik. Pero hindi ako nalulungkot, surprisingly.  

Last night, kita ko sa katabing subdivision namin yung same celebration ng pasko ko noong elementary at highschool pa ako. After simbang gabi, all out ang mga bata sa kalsada, on their best dress for the occasion. May salo-salo, may videoke, at bukas lahat ng Christmas lights. Ramdam mong festive. It gave me nostalgia seeing and hearing them laugh, dance and sing their hearts out. Napapangiti lang ako every time na sisilip ako sa bintana namin.

Kami naman sa unit, since night shift ang husband ko at naka graveyard shift ng Dec 25 (kasi 24 pa lang sa US), tulog pa sya and me, i am solving a sudoku puzzle. Pagkagising nya, nagluto lang sya ng instant ramen, and yun na ang noche buena namen. We went outside to order a dunkin coffee and sandwich at binigay namin sa guard. Then I subscribed to Viu premium for a week to watch Taxi Driver 2 hanggang sa nakatulugan ko at paggising ko ay 12noon na. Finished the book that i’ve been reading since my Holiday Break, and walked my dog sa labas.

And I realized, i felt peace (probably for the first time talaga) on a Christmas Day. Walang video call conference with my mom na walang ginawa kundi chumismis about sa buhay ng ibang relatives namen. Walang full blast speakers ng kapitbahay at 8am kasi nabitin sa videoke kagabi. Just complete silence pagkagising ko. And I loved it. 🥹

I have no one else to talk to kaya i’ve decided to post here. My Dec 24 didnt start well, but my Dec 25 is so damn peaceful right now.

I have no plans for the day. We might go to parks later or just stay at home and watch Taxi Driver. Or probably pick up my year-ender book. 💛

Chapter 1 

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for cuthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs*?*” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

**His** skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave. 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

It must have been about someone he liked. 

After all, she’d seen him smile like that many times before.. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 12 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

other. 

Their love story unfolded just like a romance novel–a bond nurtured over years of growing up side by side. 

They dated in secret, keeping it hidden from both their parents and teachers. They promised to get into the same s versity and make their relationship public one day. 

They pushed each other to improve. In the end, both scored nearly perfect on their SATs and were admitted to Har- vard University, 

Everything should have ended perfectly there. 

But something unexpected happened, 

Just one day before school began, they were in a car crash. When the car was about the hit them**,** Sylvia pushed Adrien out of the way. 

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down. 

Misfortune never comes alone. That same year, Sylvia’s parents died in a plane crash. She buckled under the weig of the blows and fell into a deep depression. 

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe, every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical **suffering** was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvía had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvía, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me. 

“Then I will let you **go** and set myself free.” ",1,1766644373.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

————————



Lena used to think happiness was quiet.



Not the loud, messy kind people bragged about online. Not grand gestures or dramatic declarations. Just calm. Predictable. Steady. The kind of life that settled into your bones until you stopped questioning it.



That was her marriage.



Comfortable. Reliable. Safe.



She and Mark had routines that fit together like puzzle pieces. Morning coffee at the kitchen island while the news murmured in the background. A quick peck on the cheek before work. Texts about groceries and bills and what to make for dinner.



Nothing explosive. Nothing broken.



If anyone asked her if she was happy, she would have said yes without hesitation. Because what else was happiness supposed to look like?



They did not fight. Not really.



No slammed doors. No screaming matches. No insults thrown in the heat of the moment. Disagreements were handled calmly, like adults who had read the same marriage books and followed the rules.



When they argued, it was about things that felt safe. Money. Scheduling. Whose turn it was to clean the bathroom. Nothing that cut too close to the bone.



Lena took pride in that.



She liked to believe they were solid. Mature. Past the chaos that wrecked other couples.



Her friends complained endlessly about their partners. About laziness and selfishness and emotional distance. Lena listened, nodded, offered sympathy. But deep down, she felt quietly relieved.



That was not her life.



Mark was steady. Dependable. He showed up when he said he would. He paid the bills on time. He remembered birthdays. He hugged her from behind when she was cooking and pecked the side of her neck in a way that felt affectionate, not urgent.



They made sense.



Or at least, that was what she told herself.



If she was being honest, their marriage had settled into something more like coexistence than passion. But Lena never saw that as a problem. Passion faded. Everyone said so. What mattered was commitment.



Stability.



Stability was happiness.



She repeated that to herself whenever she noticed the small things.



Like how Mark no longer lingered in bed on weekends. He was always up early now, already dressed, already halfway out the door with some vague excuse about errands or the gym.



Like how his phone never left his side anymore. Always face down. Always within reach.



Like how he sometimes smiled at texts and then looked up too quickly when she entered the room, as if he had been caught doing something he could not explain.



None of it felt big enough to confront.



So she did what she always did.



She ignored it.



Lena was good at ignoring things that threatened her sense of balance. She had learned that skill early in life. Learned that peace often came from letting things slide rather than digging for answers that might hurt.



She focused on work instead.



Her job was demanding in a way that left little room for overthinking. Long hours. Tight deadlines. Meetings that blurred together until her days felt like one continuous task. She liked it that way. Productivity gave her a sense of control.



When she came home exhausted, Mark was often already there. Or sometimes not. But he always texted. Always explained.



Late meeting. Dinner with a client. Gym ran long.



Reasonable things.



She never accused him of lying. Why would she?



Trust was the foundation of everything they had built.



Still, the cracks continued to form.



Small. Hairline fractures she pretended not to see.



Mark stopped asking about her day with genuine interest. The questions became automatic, like lines recited out of habit. He listened, but not closely. His attention drifted. His responses came a beat too late.



They went to bed at different times more often than not. He claimed he was tired. She believed him. Or she told herself she did.



Some nights, she lay awake beside him, staring at the ceiling, listening to his breathing. She wondered when exactly the warmth between them had cooled.



She never asked.



Asking meant risking the answer.



Instead, she adjusted.



She filled the silence with podcasts and noise. She planned dinners. She initiated intimacy even when it felt slightly forced, even when his touch seemed distracted.



He never refused her.



That counted for something.



Lena told herself this was what long-term love looked like. Comfortable. Less urgent. Less consuming.



Healthier.



She clung to that belief fiercely.



Until the night everything shifted.



It was late. Later than usual.



Lena sat curled on the couch with her laptop balanced on her knees, the glow from the screen the only light in the living room. Mark was supposed to be home hours ago. He had texted earlier, something brief about a work thing running late.



She had replied with a thumbs up.



No follow-up questions.



But as midnight crept closer, unease settled into her chest.



She told herself she was being ridiculous. He was an adult. He did not need to check in every hour. She was not his keeper.



Still, she checked the time again.



12:17 a.m.



Her phone buzzed.



Relief surged through her, quick and warm.



Then she saw the message.



Be home soon.



That was it.



No explanation. No apology.



Her fingers hovered over the screen. She typed a response, deleted it, typed again.



Everything okay?



She stared at the words for a long moment before sending them.



The typing indicator appeared. Then disappeared.



Minutes passed.



No reply.



The relief faded, replaced by a familiar knot of tension.



She closed her laptop and stood, pacing the length of the living room. She glanced at the door, half expecting it to open at any second.



It did not.



When Mark finally came home, it was nearly one in the morning.



The front door clicked softly as he stepped inside, moving with careful quiet like he did not want to wake her. She was standing in the kitchen when he rounded the corner.



Their eyes met.



For a split second, something flashed across his face.



Surprise.



Then it was gone.



“You’re still up,” he said, voice casual.



Lena crossed her arms. “You said you’d be home soon.”



He shrugged, dropping his keys into the bowl by the door. “Things ran longer than expected.”



“That happens a lot lately.”



The words slipped out before she could stop them.



Mark stiffened. Just slightly. But she noticed.



“Work’s busy,” he replied. “You know that.”



She nodded. Automatically.



Conversation over.



He pecked her forehead and walked past her toward the bedroom. The gesture felt familiar. Safe. But it did not settle the unease twisting inside her.



She stood there alone in the kitchen, staring at the space he had just occupied.



Something felt off.



Not wrong enough to accuse him. Not big enough to blow up their life.



Just off.



They went to bed without talking about it.



Mark fell asleep quickly, his back turned to her. Lena lay awake, staring into the dark. She listened to the steady rhythm of his breathing and tried to convince herself that she was imagining things.



She had no reason not to trust him.



No proof.



Only a feeling she could not name.



Eventually, exhaustion pulled her under.



She woke sometime later to an unfamiliar sound.



A vibration.



Soft. Insistent.



Mark’s phone.



It was on the nightstand, screen lighting up the dark room. Lena blinked, disoriented, her heart already beating faster.



The phone vibrated again.



She turned her head slightly.



A notification banner flashed across the screen.



She could not see the message. Only the name.



Her stomach tightened.



She told herself to roll over. To ignore it. To respect his privacy.



Trust was everything.



The phone buzzed again.



And again.



Lena sat up.



She did not know why she reached for it. Not consciously. It felt like instinct, like something in her body had decided before her mind could catch up.



Her fingers closed around the phone.



It was warm.



That detail stuck with her. As if it had been held recently.



She hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen. Her heart pounded in her ears. She told herself she would just check the time. Just see if it was morning yet.



Anything but what she was actually doing.



The screen unlocked.



Messages filled the display.



Her breath caught.



She scrolled.



Slowly. Carefully.



Her mind searched for context. For something innocent. For a misunderstanding she could cling to.



But the words were clear.



Intimate.



Familiar.



Not the kind of conversation two people have by accident.



Lena felt the room tilt.



Her pulse roared in her ears as she scrolled further, each message tightening the knot in her chest. There were jokes she did not recognize. Pet names she had never heard him use. Plans that did not include her.



Her hands shook so badly she had to grip the edge of the mattress to steady herself.



She did not cry.



Not yet.



She did not wake him.



She sat there in the dark, phone glowing in her hands, while the life she thought was settled cracked open.



Piece by piece.



She kept scrolling.



Because some part of her needed to know how far back the lies went.



And some part of her was not ready to stop.

Chapter 1 

“Ms. Rhodes, this is Dignitas calling. Did you personally apply for cuthanasia on December 25th?” 

Sylvia Rhodes’s eyelashes fluttered slightly, but her voice remained calm. “Yes.” 

“Very well. Your application has been approved. You have two weeks to put your affairs in order.” 

Just after Sylvia hung up, the bedroom door opened. 

Her husband, Adrien Farrell, entered, letting in a sharp gust of cold air. Upon seeing her, he smiled and raised a deli- cately wrapped gift. “Syl, happy birthday.” 

Sylvia smiled softly. “My birthday was yesterday.” 

Adrien froze. A flicker of panic and embarrassment crossed his face. 

“Sorry, I’ve been too busy with work lately.” 

He squatted down and gently massaged her calves, changing the subject. “How are you feeling today? Any discom- fort in your legs*?*” 

He pressed too hard, his slender hands turning red. Veins stood out on the backs of his hands, a striking sight. 

**His** skill was undeniable, but Sylvia felt nothing. 

When she didn’t respond, Adrien looked up to ask, but his phone suddenly chirped in his pocket. 

He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. The moment he saw the name, a smile spread across his face. 

Whatever he’d been about to say was forgotten. He stood up abruptly. 

“Syl, I need to handle something for work. I’ll come back to massage you later.” Then he headed to the study. 

Sylvia stayed silent, watching him leave. 

Even after he was gone, his genuine, irrepressible smile replayed in her mind. 

He’d smile wholeheartedly over work? 

It must have been about someone he liked. 

After all, she’d seen him smile like that many times before.. 

Every morning in high school, she’d hurriedly finish her milk and rush downstairs, and there he’d be, smiling just like that. He’d walk over, take her heavy backpack, and take her to school on his bike. 

They were both 12 back then, young and bright, immature yet full of life. They were completely smitten with each

He walked away unharmed, but she was left paralyzed from the waist down.

Adrien was heartbroken. Right after graduation, he proposed. 

He vowed he’d never let her down. 

He had kept his word throughout their three–year marriage. 

But the truth was exposed two weeks ago when Sylvia found his diary. 

The man who declared his love every day had been pouring out his pain in that diary. 

He wrote that he’d proposed out of a sense of duty, fearing that otherwise, everyone would blame him. 

He added that every time he came home, the heavy, suffocating feeling made it hard to breathe, every second he spent with her was a new form of torture. 

He noted that if he could have a second chance, he would have chosen the wheelchair. To him, the physical **suffering** was a far lighter weight than the crushing guilt of her sacrifice. 

He admitted that he’d fallen for another girl, Kiersten Tresham. She was vibrant, bright, and lively, just like Sylvía had been before the crash. 

The next day, Sylvia got several messages from Kiersten. 

“Sylvía, Adrien told me you’ll never walk again. You’ve known each other for so many years. Can’t you just let him go?” 

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me.

I had a obsessive compulsive disorder that just ended up saving the life of my partner.

My ocd involves fingernails and I tried to fight medically , by covering them , even by meditating.  I decided to fight it by being my self( I interpret Emptiness as a state of eternal learning) I really loved studying as a kid so I figured it i fill up the void with learned facts about fingernails and everything about it medically, cultural views and myths. 

I eventually discovered information that showed my partner was sick and not knowing he was breaking himself down.  He had moments where unfortunately lost his intellect and been progressively becoming like senile then suddenly snapping back like nothing happened. 
A example for reference 

We used the same coffee machine and pot for years.  One day the glass carafe broke and I got a new one that has extra 2 cups conpacity. Somehow getting a slightly bigger glass carafe erased all knowledge and learned skills he had concerning how to make coffee. 
It started out like a silly prank then to Ray Ramone( Everybody Loves Raymond tv show) level of weaponized incompetency strait to hysterical fits because I wouldn't explain how a larger container then before don't erase everything he's ever learned. 

Why i find it now funny in a deep Serenity like way is that for all the grief and problems my ocd caused me I couldn't care less lol. It saved the life of a person.

( it was lines horizontally spaced with unnaturally smooth beds then more lines- Liver strain caused by severe physical strain and inflammation( Fatigue Toxins).
That specific form of liver strain ( by Fatigue Toxins) causes the brain to be affected before physical symptoms show up.  This causes bouts of senile or weaponized competency to occur.

I realized what Buddha ment by suffering is temporary.
I pushed away by ocd even after I tried learning everything I could about it.  It took a friend who had misunderstood a conversation to show that the suffering i had could help someone. ",3,1766644097.0,Buddhism,3,1.0,False

# 🥱 The inbox isn't broken — it's exhausted

Email has been declared ""dead"" a dozen times, yet we still start and end every day in our inboxes. The problem isn't the medium; it's the modern workload we've piled on top of it:

* Promotions you never asked for drowning the one message you actually need.
* Five-thread back-and-forth that could be a one-line summary.
* Manual to-do juggling — copying dates into calendars, tagging yourself to remember follow-ups, marking as ""unread"" so you won't forget (and forgetting anyway).

We built Filo because we'd reached that tipping point where ""managing email"" felt like a second job. We wanted an inbox that does things for you, not another tool to babysit.

# 👉 Inbox to Done

That's the heart of what we're building with Filo. We're not just layering AI on top of your email — we're rebuilding the experience around what you actually need to do.

Every ""let's catch up next week,"" every invoice, every confirmation, every reminder — it all points to a task. So why make you dig through threads, copy-paste dates, or mentally flag messages you'll forget anyway?

We believe your inbox should act more like a smart assistant — spotting the next step and helping you take it. That's the future we're building:

**An AI-native email client that doesn't just help you read faster, but helps you act faster.**

* **Summarizes** long emails into quick, skimmable takeaways
* **Detects** action items and turns them into clear, tappable to-dos
* **Tags** what matters, hides what doesn't, and keeps your focus where it counts
* **Monitors** task progress automatically — status changes, sub-tasks, and updates stay synced without you lifting a finger

Instead of juggling inboxes and task lists, Filo ties them together — automatically. When your inbox becomes your to-do list, your workflow becomes effortless.

*It's not just email anymore. It's motion.*

# 💰 Why ""AI + email"" is usually a paywall (and why we said no thanks — for now)

AI inference isn't free. Most startups do the reasonable thing: charge users enough to cover token costs today. We took a different gamble.

* **History lesson:** A 128 MB flash drive cost US $60 in 2005. Today, 128 GB costs less than a fancy latte. Compute follows the same gravity, and AI tokens are already sliding down the slope.
* **Philosophical stance:** Email is a basic utility — like tap water or street lighting. If your goal is mass adoption, slapping a premium price tag on every AI action means gating out the very people who need it most.
* **Product focus:** Every sprint spent on billing flows is a sprint not spent on making the AI smarter, faster, kinder. We picked ""craftsmanship first, monetization later.""

Will we ever charge? Almost certainly — servers and engineers like us still need food. But as long as token costs keep falling and we keep improving our caching magic, we can push that day further out and welcome more people in.

# ⚡️ What ""AI-native"" actually feels like in Filo

* **Snapshots instead of scroll-marathons.** Open a thread, see the gist.
* **Noise cancellation.** Promos go to the quiet corner; real people float to the top.
* **One-tap To-Dos.** Filo turns ""let's meet Friday"" into a calendar event before you can forget it.
* **Chat with your inbox.** Ask Filo anything — ""summarize this thread,"" ""draft a polite reply"" — and it handles the grunt work for you.

No settings deep-dives, no YAML — just a mailbox that behaves.

# 🚀 Where we're headed next

* macOS desktop alpha kicks off this month (yep, TestFlight sign-ups welcome).
* **Multi-provider support:** Outlook and other major email services are on deck — bring every inbox under one roof.
* **Smarter sorting:** AI-powered filtering & auto-tagging that learns your habits and files messages exactly where they belong.

So far the journey has been difficult and frustrating.

I initially dialed in my coffee at a certain grind size and was using the stock plastic tamper along with a wdt and a steel leveler I got on Amazon. I was getting 18g in/36g out in about 28 seconds at times, but sometimes it was here and there due to inconsistent tamping or not being able to tamp level.

However, I changed my tamper and got a MHW-3 bomber WU series constant pressure tamper 58.35mm, and with the same grind size the 36g flowed in like 14 seconds, dialed in a little finer and still flowed pretty fast.

Now I’m left super confused. Was I tamping too hard earlier? Is 30 pounds the correct tamp pressure? Why is my coffee flowing faster when I’m using a better calibrated tamper ? Or should I keep using the self leveling tamper and dial in finer for it? Please help.",2,1766643940.0,espresso,4,0.75,False

“Do you realize he’s been trapped in a living hell because of you? He wishes he were dead. But he can’t because he has to put on a brave face and take care of you. How miserable.” 

“If he hadn’t met me, he might’ve lost his mind. Don’t you feel guilty at all? I feel terrible for **him.** Besides, he loves

me now. So, please let him go, so we can be together.” 

Immediately after, Kiersten sent a dozen photos of herself with Adrien. 

Smiling as he brewed coffee, he noticed Kiersten taking a selfie, leaned in, and posed playfully for the camera. 

He peeled a whole plate of shrimp for Kiersten and wiped sauce from her fingers. 

He followed her footprints on the beach, then brought her a handful **of** seashells, a beaming smile on his face. 

By the time she finished looking at all the photos, Sylvia’s heart hurt so badly she could barely breathe**.** It felt like it was shattering. 

But her eyes had run dry of tears, a hollow emptiness staring back from them. 

She didn’t reply, but Kiersten didn’t stop. 

Every day after, Kiersten sent new photos, each stamped with a date. 

On November 21st, Adrien and Kiersten walked together in the park as the sun set. 

On November 26th, they went to a pottery studio and made a vase together. 

On December 1st, they attended a concert, talking about music and their future. 

The photos of them kept coming… 

Each timestamp was a silent contradiction to Adrien’s claims of working late. 

Even on her birthday yesterday, Sylvia waited all day and night for him. 

But he never came back because he was enjoying fireworks with Kiersten. 

Looking at those photos, Sylvia smiled bitterly until tears spilled out. 

Back when they were both 17 years old, Adrien had loved Sylvia with all his heart. 

Now that they were 25, he didn’t love her anymore. 

That night, Sylvia sat by the window all night. The following day, she submitted all the necessary documents to an overseas euthanasia organization, resolved to end her life. 

She thought, “Adrien, you’re all I have left. 

“But you’ve been running from me. 

“Then I will let you **go** and set myself free.” ",1,1766643824.0,NovelLinks,1,1.0,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1766643698.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1pv6zf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChristianBFreeman/comments/1pv6zf6/when_real_is_enough/,When real is enough,"I asked the Lord—again—why He brought you into my life.

I’ve asked several times, actually. I’m persistent like that.

The answer never changes.

“You needed someone real to talk to.”

That was it. No thunder. No burning bush. Just the spiritual equivalent of a shrug.

Someone real, He explained. Someone who tells the hard truths. Someone who’s lived through the tough, the ugly, the beautiful, and still shows up with coffee and opinions. Someone who knows life doesn’t come with instructions, just warnings printed in very small font.

“But why,” I asked, “send me a beautiful young woman?”

The Lord didn’t even pause.

“Why not?”

Fair point. Annoyingly fair.

I told Him I wasn’t asking for anything in return. No grand expectations. No dramatic destiny. Just a conversation from time to time. Maybe a laugh. Maybe a moment where the world makes a little more sense. And the unspoken agreement that if things ever get heavy, neither of us has to carry it alone.

Why talk to you, you might ask?

Because you’re interesting.

Because you listen.

Because you’re real.

Because you’re raw.

And apparently, according to the Lord, that’s more than enough reason.",1,1766643581.0,u_ChristianBFreeman,0,1.0,False
