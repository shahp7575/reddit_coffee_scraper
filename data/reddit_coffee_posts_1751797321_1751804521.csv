I’ve been living in Dubai Marina for over a year now — and I thought it might help others if I shared some real-life pros and cons of the area, especially for people who are thinking about moving here or just arrived.

Here’s my quick honest breakdown:

**✅ Pros:**

* Everything is walkable — Marina Walk, gyms, cafes, supermarkets
* Metro + tram combo is super convenient (yes, car-free life is doable)
* Great vibe in winter — you feel like you’re on holiday all the time
* Tons of dining options, both local favorites and fancier places
* Buildings with good maintenance feel like 5-star hotels

**❌ Cons:**

* Traffic and noise on weekends, especially near Marina Mall
* Some older towers have very high service charges (and weak A/C in summer)
* Can feel too touristy during high season (Dec–Feb)
* Gym memberships and coffee runs add up fast if you’re not careful

If anyone's considering moving here, or already here and still figuring it out — happy to answer questions about:

* Real rent prices
* Best buildings (from my experience and friends)
* How safe it really feels
* Grocery, delivery life without a car
* Remote work setup tips

Also curious:  
Where do you all go when you *don’t* want to deal with Marina weekend crowds? 😅

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts or questions!",1,1751804416.0,dubaimarina,0,1.0,False
1lszvic,https://www.reddit.com/r/FordExplorerEV/comments/1lszvic/range_with_caravan/,Range with caravan,"I just have to get this off my chest. I have a lot to complain about my Ford. But that's mainly the software and the operation and such. Not the hardware.

I just got back from 2 weeks with the caravan to the GP of Austria. And that all went very easily and beyond expectations. Because I'm a bit older and I'm no longer 'driving to the south of France in one go with the diesel'. After 200km everything starts to creak and squeak and that's not the caravan or the car.

On the way back I thought I'd try to push it to the limit. And the conditions were perfect. Not perfect for speeding up, but perfect for testing the range with a caravan. It was hot and very busy. The average speed was therefore lower than usual. Sometimes traffic jams, but generally an average of 85kmh. I'm only allowed to drive 80 in Germany, but I drive with the fastest freight traffic. On the way there it was usually around 94, now only 85.

It was from a campsite called ‘Hohe Wand’ near Vienna, to a campsite along the motorway near Wurzburg over a distance of 635 km. The navigation had recommended a detour because of a traffic jam that took me straight through Linz and Passau. That was not nice and does not make it any more efficient.

I started those 635 km with 83% and after only s 1 (One, Uno, Eins, Une, Één) charging stop to 93%, which I needed much more than the Ford, I arrived in Wurzburg with 15%. That 93% was therefore unnecessary long.

I needed that charging time myself for coffee, sandwiches, toilet, and a short sit.

Two stints of well over 300 km with plenty of leeway. In theory I could have driven 400 km that day under those conditions with a f\*kking caravan!",1,1751804411.0,FordExplorerEV,0,1.0,False

**My girlfriend is turning 21 and wants me (21M) to throw her a party. How do I break the news that no one will show up?**



Birthdays have always been hard on my girlfriend. She's had a few parties as a child where no one showed up, and since moving states in the middle of high school she hasn't made close friends.

Here at college, she tries hard to make friends. She talks well to people on a superficial basis but doesn't have any real friends. She's never been invited to a college party and has often missed out on many typical activities.

We've been together for 3 years, since freshman orientation. I don't have friends but I'm happy that way. I like keeping to myself if I'm not spending time with her. Since she's naturally extroverted, she spends her free time with me, or at club meetings trying to connect to people.

She's asked if I could put together a small party so I invited some acquaintances, my roommates, etc. everyone said no. I gave the invites well in advance too. I don't know how to break the news to my girlfriend, she's been so excited. She thought providing free food and drink would be a great way to make friends. But people don't want to come for even that. What can I do?

tl;dr: My friendly but friendless girlfriend wanted me to throw a 21st birthday party for her, but no one accepted. How do I still make this a special day? How do I tell her without crushing her?



**Comments**



**\[deleted\]**

*Why do all these people you know (friends, roommates, etc) dislike her enough not to come? If she is extroverted, what's going wrong with how she interacts with people to make them not want to be around her?*

>OOP: I don't know. She can be a bit silly and goofy, but I like that about her. She doesn't cause drama, she's a good listener, has a good sense of humor. She's extroverted but tends to be shy around new people. She also tends to act pretty differently depending on the person. I do that too to an extent. Honestly I don't know why people are all declining. I've never been invited to a party but I'd go to support someone.

**\[deleted\]**

*Why don't you ask them?*

>OOP: They all make BS excuses about being busy. Some of these people I know are not busy that day. I don't think they want to insult her to my face.

**huntgather**

*They probably don't actually dislike her. They're probably basically neutral about her and are surprised that they're invited to her party. Did you tell them that it's a small party? People will attend big parties even if they're not super close to the host, but a small party basically says ""close friends only."" They may even feel that you were mistaken in inviting them if they think it's a small party for her best friends.*

*Edit: Recently a woman invited me and a few of my friends to her birthday party. We weren't close with her and definitely wouldn't have gone to her apartment for drinks because it would feel weird since, again, we weren't close. BUT. Her party was a karaoke party, which is something my friends and I like to do anyway. So we showed up and had a great time with her. Is there anything that your acquaintances love to do that you could build your party around instead of drinking?*



**Update - 1 day later**



I logged into facebook at like 2 AM last night and my girlfriend has posted a message on the party event wall saying the party was cancelled. She saw the no-shows before I could let her know about it.

I called her and suggested some other activities we could do, things like amusement parks or concerts or taking a cooking class. I thought she'd like all those ideas.

""No thank you.""

We were kinda quiet over the phone, until she asked me in a really small voice if I could come over.

We met outside her dorm at like 3 in the morning. She was crying, as I expected. But it was just watery eyes, not full on sobs how she usually cries.

""It's okay,"" she said. ""Some people aren't meant to have friends.""

I told her she was exaggerating, that she just needs to look in different places, etc. She shook her head. ""No, I'm done.""

This morning at breakfast we passed a lot of mutual acquaintances. Usually my girlfriend smiles and says hello. Today she just kept her eyes on the pavement, not looking at anyone. She barely ate. But other than that she seemed like her normal self with me, talking and laughing. She just wouldn't look at anyone else.

She told me how she's going to use this extra time to get better in her classes, to work on her jewelry and maybe open an etsy shop. To read more books.

I asked her if this is really what she wanted.

""No, but life doesn't always give you what you want. I didn't want to be an engineer. I didn't want to live in a basement alone. I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out. But you make the best of it.""

Her voice was breaking as she said this, but she didn't cry. She left the breakfast table after that and said she wanted to be alone.

Where the hell do I go from here? Her actual birthday is tomorrow (we were throwing the party a week later) and she insists she doesn't want to do anything. Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends? I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable.

tl;dr: Girlfriend canceled party, said she didn't want to do anything for her birthday, and announced that she's given up on finding friends. She isn't going back to any of her clubs or activities, and is going to focus on her studies and hobbies this coming year. Her actual 21st birthday is tomorrow. Where do I go from here?

EDIT: I am sitting with her in her dorm room right now. She's on the bed reading, I'm on the couch minding my own business, just being near her. She is okay.



**Comments**



**relathrow404**

I've read the entirety of your other thread and your comments here, and I have a few thoughts that I hope you won't take personally. You seem to truly care for your girlfriend and I think you're a great boyfriend to her. That being said...

Neither of you seem to understand social interactions, and you seem to be reinforcing each other's misunderstandings. You wrote that she skips from group to group events but ""hasn't even been able to get a girl to go for coffee with her."" That's understandable. You would have to meet up in a group setting a few times in college to be memorable and comfortable enough for a one-on-one invite. I feel like she fails on getting the one-on-one invite and she feels as though she's doing something wrong, and you feel as though she's doing something wrong, when in reality she's approaching the situation incorrectly to begin with.

If she wants to make friends, she should sign up for book clubs, knitting circles, jewelry making groups, and go to them continuously. Go to [www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) and find some groups for her in your area. They will usually have a good mix of college kids and older in a college town, giving her exposure to people in all stages of life and -- more importantly -- social spectrums. These are people who want to make friends.

Frankly, the fact that you aren't interested in friends is holding her back, though that's not your fault. She wants to be social and has entered into a cycle of not having friends -> getting desperate -> alienating people through desperation -> not having friends. You may feel as though she should ""just give up,"" but if she picks up on that, it's only going to make her worse. She is clearly a social person.

I have a feeling that you not wanting friends ""as a personal choice,"" and focusing solely on work and your girlfriend, is deterring many people who know you two as a couple. They probably see you as cold and/or emotionless, even if you don't mean to be that way. It is unusual to be disinterested in friendship, especially after so long. You've had roommates for three or four years in college, get along reasonably well with them, and yet have never been interested in them as friends; of course they won't come to your girlfriend's party! I wouldn't want to either. I would feel weirded out by even being asked.

If you want to help your girlfriend, you may just have to step outside of your own social comfort zone a little and at least try to be a little friendlier. Couples tend to meet people together, and if you're coming off as aloof and not needing human interaction ""by choice,"" you're going to run people off away from her.

Edit: By the way, I don't mean to put the onus on you to change. If she was here asking for advice, I would be focusing on her. But she's already gotten some great advice from other people here, and I wanted to comment on some things that were sticking out to me in your replies.



**Update - 2 days later**



""Short update here. I stayed with my girlfriend for a while last night. She just read a book and didn't talk much. I cuddled her a bit, but she mostly wanted space.

This morning, I came to her room with flowers and a gift. She accepted the flowers with a smile. She told me she wanted to go home to her parents this weekend. I was pretty sad about that, I wanted to make her feel loved and special. But she said she needed to get off campus for a bit, so I said okay. I took her to the bus stop, said goodbye, and now here I am.

She did love the present though. It was a book she'd been wanting for a while.

Hopefully she'll feel better when she comes back.

tl;dr Girlfriend went home for her birthday.""



**Comments**



**AdmanUK**

*You have done the right thing so far, so very well done, you are a hell of a guy. One thing though, you might want to ring ahead and tell her parents what happened. I know she seems okay but you don't go from the level of sadness she has had over the last few days to 'okay' that quickly. Might be best if they keep an eye on her.*

>OOP: She's already home by now (it's not very far) and they're likely celebrating her birthday. I don't really want to put a damper on things, she obviously wants to move on.

**AdmanUK**

*Ah fair enough then. Still, credit to you, you are an awesome boyfriend and a great human being. I know everyone is feeling for your girlfriend right now (including myself) but you have been through hell too. I've been in similar situations and I know how helpless and useless you feel but you are doing all the right things. Top human marks for you.*

>OOP: Thanks, I appreciate it.

**aliceinborderland**

*Remember what people said in your last update...maybe just a quick call to be sure she arrived safely, nothing more needed.*

>OOP: She called me once she got there, she's fine.



**Update - 2 months later**



Anyway, the school year is in full swing and she cries all the time. At least three times a week, if not more. She feels like she's taking advantage of my kindness so she tries not to cry in front of me. She's completely abandoned the search to find friends, and doesn't go out except for food, class, etc. There are happy moments too, and she'll still go out with me, but she just seems fragmented over all.

She actually did pursue therapy at our university, because she felt like she really needed someone to talk to that wasn't me. They informed her that all the spots they had were full and that unless she was a suicide risk they didn't have room. Heartless, right? It really made her feel bad, but she didn't want to lie and say she was a suicide risk.

She feels lonelier than ever. There's no doubt in my mind that she's depressed. She pours all her energy into schoolwork and hasn't really touched her hobbies much, either.

She can't afford therapy other than the university, and they won't give it to her. Is there any way she can get the help she needs?

tl;dr: My girlfriend's depression is getting worse, she tried to get therapy and was informed that she couldn't. Is there anything she/we can do?



**Comments**



**\[deleted\]**

*Lastly, and this might be difficult to hear - but she needs to stop placing so much of a priority on people liking her and wanting to hang out with her. I learned long ago that some people just won't like you - and that's perfectly OK. Nothing at all you can do about it. She should pursue her interests, join clubs, etc. When she begins appearing more confident and well-adjusted, friendships will naturally follow.*

*DING DING DING KNOCKOUT*

>OOP: That's what she's been doing for the last three years. She was actually pretty confident for a while, but I guess she always thought she would've made one or two friends by now and it's starting to crash down around her.

**\_procyon**

*You're in your senior year right? Unfortunately by now most people already HAVE a circle of friends - it's going to be much harder to suddenly become the new person in a group who have been hanging out together for years. Close friends in college may not happen for her. She should focus more on getting through school and what comes after - who knows, maybe everyone in her new job will love her! At the very least it will be a fresh start.*

*Have you considered moving in together after school? I'm pretty introverted and don't hang out with people much, but I come home to my boyfriend every day and that means a lot to me, I don't ever feel lonely.*

>OOP: We do plan to move in together, I plan to propose after graduation. But she doesn't have any plans for herself for after graduation, so I don't know if she'll be happy or not.

**\_procyon**

*Then that's my advice to you - stop focusing on college and focus on what comes after. She needs to start making plans - she is planning to have a career right? Can she look into getting an internship in something related to her field?*

*Please remind her that she will be starting all over again after she graduates anyway -- stick it out and then just keep trying.*

>OOP: She's in a major she hates, so she's been avoiding everything related to after graduation. I worry about what she's going to do too, she's very smart but her major isn't right for her at all, so if she got into industry she'd probably hate it.

**\_procyon**

Well she's gotta figure it out eventually so why not now? She has to work somewhere after graduating or you are going to end up supporting her financially.

>OOP: I don't mind supporting her, but I know she wouldn't like that. She might be thinking about a plan, but she hasn't talked about it much. I don't mind supporting her, but I know she wouldn't like that. She might be thinking about a plan, but she hasn't talked about it much.

**\_procyon**

*So talk to her about it. Help her make a concrete plan, then start taking steps to make it happen. Start figuring it out - where are you guys going to live? What career path is she going to choose? What can she do NOW, today, to make it easier to get into that career? You say you want to help, so help her - that is going to involve the two of you actually DOING something.*

>OOP: I mean, she'll live with me, I've gotten a job and such. She already plans to move with me. But I do agree that she needs to figure out a plan for herself. She wouldn't be happy just staying at home.

1lszri5,https://i.redd.it/p47ayi7uw8bf1.jpeg,☕ Colômbia Huíla Decaf - Buraca Roasters,"Olá a todos,

Durante o campeonato de Aeropress, decidi apostar às cegas neste descafeinado de especialidade como substituto de um Etiópia SWP, cujo aroma não estava a agradar à minha mulher.

Confesso que, pelo preço (18,60€ por 250g), hesitei várias vezes antes de avançar. Mas...revelou-se, sem dúvida, o melhor descafeinado que já provei até hoje, ainda q, eu n tenha experiência com descafeinados de especialidade.

Rivaliza por completo com cafés cafeinados de especialidade, e até superou um Colômbia de 88 pontos (de outro roaster) que estou a beber este mês. Diria que ninguém que prove este café diga que é um descafeinado, de tanta qualidade que tem.

A embalagem indica que é direcionado para expresso, mas surpreendeu pela versatilidade — funcionou lindamente também em filtro, o que agradou bastante todos cá em casa que o experimentaram.

Aromáticamente falando, é um café muito frutado e doce, mas que é compensada por uma elevada acidez, que lhe confere um equilíbrio e frescura brutal. Um grande café de verão.

Parabéns à Buraca Roasters pela escolha deste grão e pela torra bem executada.

1lszl71,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lszl71,Further 0.4 mm nozzle tests and filler,"Hi there.

I've been busy at work lately, so I love the idea of using the 0.4 mm nozzle to print some minis very fast. These minis are printed using the 0.4 mm nozzle at a layer height of 0.06 mm. If you're interested in the settings, here's a link to the post discussing my conclusions and process: https://www.reddit.com/r/FDMminiatures/comments/1lp8zwb/the_04_mm_nozzle_a_small_settings_release_for/

This time, I also experimented with using fillers, specifically a cheap store brand superglue. I'm experienced in using epoxies and isocyanates, and I'm going to warn you first, if you're going to try out this method.

The main ingredient is ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate, which is extremely toxic, plainly speaking. Do not use this stuff for extended periods of time without proper precautions. Using it from an open container, like I do, is not a good idea to do indoors, and I'm lucky to have a balcony to enjoy a nice cup of coffee on. In this instance, applying superglue on miniatures is also a very good application of this space.

I use a wooden grill stick, the ones you buy to use for a good barbeque, open the superglue container, place it securely on a table next to me half an arms length away, dip the pointy end of the stick into it, and then I apply it evenly on the figure. I did this with my Anchorite Shrine, too, and for bigger minis it works wonders. Because of the exothermic properties of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (meaning it heats up during the bonding process) it settles inbetween the layer lines and fuses them together ever so slightly. The glue is also extremely effective at removing stringing, which I showcased in my last post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FDMminiatures/comments/1lqgl71/the_04_mm_nozzle_006_mm_layer_height/

It's very fast reacting, and as soon as it's applied I blow a hard gust of wind from my mouth onto the place of application. Be careful not to spit on it, as it will interact with the glue and leave an undesirable surface. If available, use a can of compressed air, as it's much better and easier.

For these minis, I was a bit too slow in regards to removing the excess, but there's learning to be had in that as well. The 0.4 mm nozzle, though very good for minis, does not capture EVERY single detail, and using this method, it's very easy to loose some details. It does, however, smooth out scarring extremely effectively, as in its almost gone by FDM standards. I only wish I had a spray machine to spray the primer on, but a brush can do for now. Otherwise, the surface would have been a little less bumpy, but it's okay for now I think. I also need to be more thorough, as I forgot to apply the glue on top the communicant's left arm and most of the staff, as seen in the picture. It should contrast nicely with the chest area, of which the layer lines are completely gone, and without any loss of detail too.

That's it, really. I hope you like it, and thanks for reading!",4,1751803444.0,FDMminiatures,2,1.0,False

I woke up and found my Jowi having a seizure. We rushed him to the vet, but he didn’t make it. There were no signs, no warnings. He was healthy, playful, and full of life, until he was suddenly gone.

For almost six years, Jowi was by my side every single day. Working from home meant we had our own little world. Our morning routine, his tail wagging as I made coffee, his breakfast before I started my shift. Tomorrow’s routine will never be the same.

I can’t sleep tonight. He’s always slept beside me. The silence in my bed feels heavier than anything I’ve ever known.

Jowi wasn’t just a pet. He was my soul dog, My little monster, My baby. The one who made everything better just by being there. It feels like we both died today, but only him who stops breathing.

In our time together, we shared:
🐾 6 holidays
🎂 11 birthdays
💼 2 jobs
🏡 2 homes
🌴 countless vacations and quiet moments

Now I’m left with his things, his toys, his stinky blanket, his dino clothes, his dog bowls, and a heart full of memories I’ll never let go of.

First a bit of history: I was diagnosed with frozen shoulder about 3 months ago. Over a year ago I went to my orthopedist with upper arm/shoulder pain and I mentioned that a friend of mine (who knows sports medicine, yoga, etc.) suggested I might have a pinched nerve in my neck (cervical radiculopathy), he agreed and I started a course of PT and a regimen of ibuprofen to lower the inflammation. The ibuprofen helped the pain somewhat (I didn't always take it as directed tbh, and took less than the ortho had suggested) and the stretches did seem to help but I still had consistent pain.

Then late last summer, after a bout of food poisoning and a viral infection, I decided to eliminate wheat and sugar from my diet for a month. I lost ten pounds and the shoulder pain went away completely. Then I went back to my usual way of eating and the pain gradually returned, so obviously the inflammation caused by wheat and sugar had an impact. Then in February I broke my wrist, and having my arm immobilized in a cast is apparently what led to FS, although at first my shoulder pain was mild in the wake of the injury. But then after 2 months my shoulder pain was increasing and spreading so I went back to my orthopedist who after about a minute of observation and tests proclaimed I have FS and prescribed PT.

My ortho also mentioned surgery and cortisone injections as possible treatments down the line, neither of which I wanted to do. I had good success treating my trigger finger in my opposite hand with holistic approaches a few years ago so I decided to research that route for FS. I had already started a cholesterol-lowering diet for a recent high-LDL reading at my GP (had never had high cholesterol before, ahhh, the joys of middle age).

The anti-inflammation diet is very similar to the cholesterol-lowering diet so I just adjusted and tried to be very stringent to see if I could notice the difference. I've tried to to eliminate all sugar (except a bit of honey or maple sugar/syrup), processed foods (white flour), foods with additives (I'm reading all labels! there's maltodextrin in almost everything now), high fat dairy (most cheese), alcohol, etc.  I cut out all bread products and alcohol. It was hard at first! I also started eating more fruits and veggies and more oily fish (salmon, tuna, etc.) Lean beef and chicken, lean ham, maybe a little bacon here and there. I used to enjoy pork ribs or pork chops occasionally, but now can only eat a small amount for some reason which is probably good.

After the first two weeks I had lost 5 lbs and was feeling better. Now my shoulder pain, which was fairly constant, is lessened to very little. I haven't taken ibuprofen for shoulder pain in two weeks. I have added in a bit of organic wine and beer (check labels for sulfites and additives), and a bit of organic bread (Trader Joe's has a whole grain one made in Denmark). I mainly eat goat cheese (less inflammatory) but now have an occasional bit of cow's milk cheese, and organic half and half in my coffee. No fats for cooking except olive oil, avocado oil, and organic grass-fed butter or ghee.

I've lost another 5 lbs. and have more energy (I work as a gardener and have been very busy), and my appetite seems more streamlined. I'm not craving junk food at all (though I do some olive oil potato chips occasionally).

I still don't have full range of motion and am continuing my PT stretches (which were causing me pain at first but it's gradually getting better). Anyway if you thought maybe an anti-inflammatory diet might not work for you, give it at least two weeks and you just may notice a difference.",2,1751803157.0,frozenshoulder,0,0.75,False

I am a very low maintenance person. My pregnancy has also been horrid so far. Healthy thank god, but just all the bad symptoms imaginable have happened. 

I told my mom I would love a shower but I want it to be very casual. Literally back yard with pizza and beer or soda for the family. Or like a morning thing with pastries, coffee, and tea. Simple. 

She decided to start making all these Pinterest boards with different themes and wants to order so much money worth of decorations off of Amazon which I am vehemently against. She also wants to get catering and all of this over the top stuff.

She told me that EVERY baby shower is like this and that if we don’t do all this, no one will have fun. She said the baby shower isn’t about me but it’s about the people attending. 

Am I a monster for wanting to push for something just easy and casual without a theme? I’m so tired and nauseous and my body hurts. 


The other problem is I asked her if she absolutely insists on a theme, can she just get reused or second hand decorations since I have 2 sisters in laws who have had babies in the last couple years? She said this is WAY more pressure on her and she just will buy everything on Amazon anyway and lie and say it’s second hand. ",3,1751802950.0,pregnant,9,1.0,False

He is probably in his 40s and based on his ring and the pictures Ive seen of his family, he is married with kids. He is super friendly always talking to me about books and movies.

Anyways yesterday, my coworker told me that he had asked what my schedule was and had said that he was interested in me ""romantically."" I was honestly shocked. I thought we were just being friendly? But now that i think about it, it is weird that he has tipped me that much.

I have been keeping all his tips in a separate jar because they have been so excessive. I have like $800 now. I was thinking about maybe giving it back when he eventually said he wanted to be friends, or saving it, but now I could really use the money for my student loans.

Today he came in and asked me if I wanted to grab dinner sometime. I politely declined and said I don't date customers. I think he must've felt embarrassed, but he just kept going on and on about how he has been ""investing"" in our friendship. The word ""investing"" made me super uncomfortable.

I decided then that I am going to keep all the money, because they are technically tips for my service right? But now I wonder if I was leading him on at all by accepting his amount of tips.

Falcons do it, Commodores do it, surely the big Mitsi’s got a little bit of bogan spirit hiding under the bonnet.

Rock up to this sketchy industrial lot, dead quiet, bit of gravel, feels right. Traction control off — or at least I pressed the button and it blinked like “mate, don’t even try.” Foot on the brake, slapped it in Drive, gave it a fat bootful and waited for magic.

Nothing.

It revved up like it was about to launch into orbit, then just sat there looking embarrassed. Eventually, the front tyres gave the saddest little chirp you’ve ever heard. Like a pigeon sneezed. The trans made this noise like a DVD player dying in slow motion, and I swear the whole car shuddered like it just realised what I was trying to do and wanted no part of it.

The skid lasted about half a second before the car went “nah mate” and cut power harder than Western Power during a heatwave. Whole thing smelled like clutch fluid and shame. Nearly got smoked by a Corolla doing a legal U-turn right after.

Honestly, FWD skids feel like pissing in your own shoe. Something technically happens, but no one wants to be near it and it just ruins your day. The 380 isn’t a burnout machine — it’s a Bunnings run veteran. A Coles warrior. It wants to be at a servo parked next to a Camry, not trying to prove itself like some underpowered VL.

Might whack a “Still Skids (Sometimes)” sticker on the back and let the dream die gracefully. Or just soak the front tyres in detergent and pretend.

         ::: Interests :::

I have a lot of interests which we may connect on, and if not, a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and your own passionate interests go a long way. 

- **Psychology** is my passion. Mental health, neurodivergencies, addiction, behavior, methods and theories, neurology, all of it. Ive studied it, and I've lived a lot of it, too.
- **Spirituality** is also a passion of mine. My approach is very eclectic and open. I love all things mystical. If you are at all religious and/or spiritual, we will have tons to talk about! If you aren't, no worries :)
- **Nature**. Rock and fossil hunting 🪨 🦖. I love natural running water. I could sit in one spot in a river or creek for hours 💧 and insects are friends.
- **Arts and crafts.** I love to create. Im still learning though...everything I know so far is pretty basic. But, ive started zentangle drawings, i crochet, do macrame hemp jewlery and other macrame projects, beaded and rock wire wrap jewlery, collages, and im in a ceramics class.
- **Journaling.** Shadow work. Learning about myself.
- **Poetry.** Its been awhile since ive written. Share yours and inspire me?
- **Pets/Animals**. I currently have two dogs and one cat, but Ive had some different kinds of animals over the years. Do you have any?
- I play **billiards**, **corn hole**, **board games**, and/or **card games** weekly
- Im in an **improv** class and loving it. I need to watch more improv, any suggestions?
- I don't read much these days, but when i do its **non-fiction** about interests, or really random **comic books**. Or the **FF** comics.

- **Other likes:** piercings, coffee, tea, waffle house, tootsie pops, turtles, **philosophy**, deep reflective and introspective convos, pedantic discussions about etymology, **Buddism, Quakerism,** entomology, **tarot**, divination, numerology, astrology, tats, incense and candles, *witchy stuff*, collections (got any?), puns/dad humor

- **Media?? Not really!** TV, movies, music, videos... it is ***not*** how I connect. 🚫 However, I like rock, grunge, alt, punk, folk/indie, and some 80s and 00s pop. I watch family sitcoms and The Office. Futurama. AHS, Twilight Zone, and Black Mirror. ""Crazy Ex-Gf"" too. But i rarely watch anything.
Idc to watch movies much, either. But I like cult classics and B movies....and Marvel is pretty cool. 

I also have 0 interest in video games. 

I **LOVE** silence 🏝

Im seeking platonic connections, but open to more potentially happening with a woman.

You dont have to make your intro this long! 😅 BUT *pretty please* put...
- age, gender, general location
- what we relate on
- your interests and hobbies 
- tell me what your favorite insect is, so i know you read this post (get yourself that credit)

After having an amazing time last year at the Unofficial Dutch TI Tournament organized by the brilliant [Automatic\_Cap\_7651](https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic_Cap_7651/), I am happy to announce I will be carrying the torch this year! I will be looking to recreate the success and not fiddle too too much with the formula.

**What:** The second Unofficial Dutch TI Tournament.

**When:** Saturday the 8th and Sunday the 9th of November.

**Where:** At [Muntmeesters in Utrecht](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ssNN5WyEW6tYioqR6), same as last time: about 15 minutes walking from the Utrecht Central station, and about 15 minutes walking from the nearest super market.

**How:** It will probably be a 36 people tournament (Saturday), with the winners going to the finals (Sunday) and the not-winners playing a second game for fun (Sunday). I'm going for base + pok + codices (depending on availability). As to the draft, I'm thinking a Milty draft with 8 factions and 8 slices.

**Who:** Everyone who wants to join and that has at least played a game of TI before. I will charge a price (which will be paying for mostly the venue and a small prize). Since there was a substantial number of non-Dutch speaking of players last time, we will be speaking English unless the whole table happens to speak Dutch. Please let me know if I'm incorrectly assuming that will be no problem.

**WANTED:** players who are willing and able to bring their game (preferably including PoK and 3 codices). Let me know in the sign up form if you would be up for this and I will be contacting you to double check.

**Misc:**

* **Signup:** Fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_laeEIVVCwE5lsxNW-rfrsAPb3Als2COtER9zmm3o-KE1w/viewform?usp=header). If we end up having more players than can be fit into the location, there will be a waitlist. It will be mostly first come first serve, but for logistical reasons players willing to bring their game will be increasing their odds of making the cut.
* **Price:** since the expenses have not yet been finalized, TBD. Should be about **15-20 Euros** *(Note: this is a an estimate)*.
* **Prize:** There will be a small prize for the winner! Though the real prize is that we will all get to play some TI together.
* **Food and drinks:** It should be possible to make tea and coffee or tap some water in the kitchen area. Snacks, meals, and other drinks are bring your own.
* **Codex 4:** I think it would be fun to use the *new* new magen and X-89 (if your table/game doesn't have the new cards printed, just share the images and play pretend), the new relics are a bit harder to proxy so will leave that up to whoever brings the games
* **Questions?** Ask them here or in the signup form or message me on Discord.

F20 here. Lumabas ako recently with my guy friend (M21) — parang date siya, and the whole time medyo clingy kami sa isa’t isa. Holding hands, linking arms, etc. Pero pag-uwi, he asked if he could kiss me and honestly, na-off ako. I backed away and said no. Nag-sorry siya after through chat, pero di ko pa siya nirereplyan hanggang ngayon. I’m still processing it. Tama ba 'yung reaction ko?

Context: We went out to eat and grab coffee, super chill lang naman dapat. Pero habang magkasama kami, naging sobrang close — like, nagho-holding hands kami while walking, naka-link arms kami sa café, tapos sa kotse on the way home, holding hands pa rin kami for like 30 mins habang nagda-drive siya. I won’t lie, I felt safe and enjoyed the moment. May part din sa’kin na kinilig.

Pero pagdating sa house namin, he walked me to the door, we hugged, tapos bigla niya hinawakan yung cheeks ko and asked, “Can I kiss you?” Doon ako nashock. Like, bigla. I didn’t expect it at all. I pulled away and said no.

Nag-message siya later saying sorry if he made me feel uncomfortable, na di daw niya intention and all that. Pero hindi ko pa siya nirereplyan. Hindi ako galit, pero parang something shifted after that.

Feeling ko tuloy, was I giving mixed signals? Kasi clingy din naman ako that night. Pero hindi ko rin talaga in-expect na it would end with a kiss attempt.

Okay lang ba na hindi ko muna siya kausapin? Or dapat ba I explain how I felt? Confused lang ako right now.

There had been a couple of knocks at the door and those times, I’d stayed very still. They seemed to have just been checking to talk to the neighbours. It didn’t seem like they knew what had happened on this side.

Having been in my birthday suit for most of that time, in the end, I’d decided it would be better to have some clothes on, so I’d gone to Darren’s room and found some jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a hoodie to wear. I’d hoped they were washed but I didn’t think too much about it. At the end of the day, I needed to be ready to move as soon as I could. As I sat down on the sofa, I wondered how long the police needed, to get through everything.

“…a Delroy Campbell…” I heard someone say on my balcony. Darren’s patio door was still open. I sidled close to it, whilst making sure I was out of view so I could hear better.

“…he’d heard what he thought was fighting and then, what he believed, were gunshots.”

“Gunshots?”

“That’s what he says.”

“Anything else?”

“Er…he said…he came to check with the occupants when he heard the noises and the gentleman – we assume Mr Clarke – said everything was fine.” It sounded like he was reading from something. “Mr Campbell then asked to talk to his girlfriend, at which point Mr Clarke let him in. He saw a Chinese girl on the sofa and asked how she was. After looking at Mr Clarke, she responded she was fine. It looked like she was under duress. Mr Campbell called the police as soon as he returned to his flat.

“Here’s the odd thing though. After calling the police, he heard similar noises on another three occasions. Fighting and gunshots, about seven or eight minutes apart. He called the police another time, but given everything going on today, we didn’t have the units to spare.”

“Nothing to help us identify where Clarke might have gone?”

“No.”

“Him killing his girlfriend and then trying to make a run for it doesn’t sound right to me. Why would you kill the girl?”

“Maybe she was trying to turn him over to the Pantheon? Or to the police?”

“But where’s the body? All we have are his bloodied clothes. Where did he have the time to kill her and hide her body? Have we located the girlfriend’s car yet?”

“Working on it.”

Then the police radio sounded with a crackle and a message from dispatch that I couldn’t hear. The one who had given the report spoke again. “Getting news that River Clarke has been spotted in Wembley.”

“Wembley?”

“His parents live there.”

“Alright. Stay here and finish up the processing. When you’re done, leave two people on the...” I heard them walk away from the balcony.

No idea how I’d been spotted in Wembley but whoever needed the glasses, thank you very much. It was all the way over in Northwest London, a good twenty-five minute drive from Swiss Cottage or Hampstead.

I shuffled along the ground and lay on the thin rug, beside the coffee table. Hopefully, with that info, the police would hurry up and it wouldn’t be long before I could leave.

 

\*\*\*

 

It was long. Seven hours long.

I’d fallen asleep at some point, waking up to an uncomfortable back from having slept on the hard floor. I was more tired than I’d thought and even with the aches, it was good to have rested. Who knows when I’d next be able to get some peaceful shut-eye? It didn’t seem to have done anything for those niggly pains in my knees however, as I got to my feet and rubbed my eyes awake.

 It was almost seven thirty in the evening, the sun almost down. There was very little movement that I could hear from my flat on the other side of the walls and I carefully made my way to the front door in the dark, revolver in the hoodie’s pocket, phone and cigs in the bottoms.

I peeked through the peephole and saw the last of the officers leaving with boxes and bags, making their way to the lifts. I wasn’t as tense as I might’ve been had I been awake through the whole thing. It was like sleeping through turbulence on a plane. I’d done that plenty of times. The alternative was having high blood-pressure and praying that you got through to the end alive. I prefer the sleeping method.

I headed back to the balcony and listened out for anyone in my flat near there. Not hearing anything, I risked stepping outside and looking down at the car park. I couldn’t see a single police car near the exit though there were a couple closer to the building’s entrance. My gnome-mobile was missing too. Probably towed away for further inspection.

I leant against the balcony and checked my phone. A few messages from Kian and Carmen.

 

12:32

Carmen

*We dumped the car in Wembley. Stay safe xxx*

 

15:13

Carmen

*Getting worried. Not heard from you. Text back xxx*

 

17:28

Carmen

*Honey. Please text back. Where are you? X*

 

19:11

Carmen

*Honey, just let us know if you’re safe? We’re still near the flat. Don’t see much police around anymore, so just let us know and we’ll pick you up x*

 

 

12:34

Kian

*Told police you were in Wembley.*

 

14:05

Kian

*Where you at?*

 

17:11

Kian

*Came by the block of flats. Lot of five-o there. Hope you’re alright, bro. Let us know asap.*

 

I quickly messaged them both back that I’d been sleeping, the police had just left and I was going to leave myself now. Carmen didn’t text back. Kian did.

 

19:28

Kian

*Bro? Why would you tell Carmen that you were sleeping?*

 

I asked him what he meant.

 

19:30

Kian

*She’s been worried shitless. We’ve been trying to keep her calm and then you tell her you’re sleeping? Seriously? Just get your arse down here. We’re over at Primrose Hill. The entrance by the shop parade.*

 

See what I mean about high blood-pressure and worrying too much. I’m sure most people in a similar situation would stress out. They’d think about next steps and all the things that could go wrong and all the reasons they should do this or that. Me? I feel like thinking too much cripples you into inaction. You’ll talk yourself into not doing things. As far as I was concerned, there was nothing for me to do here except wait it out. It’s not like the police would have forced entry into this home. Not without good reason.

Still, maybe I shouldn’t have told her I was sleeping. At least, maybe I should have explained myself better. She’d understand when she thought about it. I’m gonna blame it on not having a coffee. Always have a coffee when you wake up.

I texted Kian back to let him know I’d be there as soon as I could - it was about a fifteen minute walk away.

I put the phone into my pocket, made my way back to the front door and took a look through the peephole again. It let me see the corridor and the apartment doors across and on either side. The coast looked clear. I looked around for some footwear that wasn’t bloodied, finding some black trainers but they looked small. Checking the tag, it showed it was a size eight. I found another pair that was size ten. Taking a glance at Darren and Michelle’s purplish-blue feet, it seemed the larger pair belonged to Michelle. I put them on – a size too big, but still more comfortable than the eights. As I put the trainers on, I was reminded of the bandage on my hand. Carefully, I took it off. The cut was raw and pink, with bits of dried blood but it wasn’t bleeding.

I discarded the bandage, stood at the door and took a deep breath. Walk out like I owned the place, wait for the lift, short journey down and then I would have freedom. At least temporarily. Enough to figure out what to do next. I took another deep breath and opened the door.

I stepped out, quickly closing the door behind me so there wasn’t even the slightest chance of someone seeing Darren and Michelle’s lifeless bodies. From the corner of my eye, I spotted two officers standing outside my door and I turned to walk in the opposite direction as if I didn’t know they were there.

“Excuse me, sir.”

Fuck.

I turned to face them, my hands in the hoodie pocket with the revolver. I had my hood up and it came forward enough to cover the gem in my head. Unless they got too close.

“Yes?”

“Do you live next door, sir?” the officer closest to me said. He was a little taller than me, broad in the shoulders, a baton, taser and pepper spray at his waist. The other one was of a similar height and similarly geared.

“Yes, I do,” I lied. “How can I help?”

“Officers have been trying to contact you about your neighbours,” the officer started walking towards me. I wanted to take a step back but I stood firm. Running would cause more issues. As far as they knew right now, River Clarke was several miles away. If I ran now, I’d draw them right back here.

“Is that so? I’ve been asleep most of the day. I work night shifts.”

“Would you mind answering some questions?” the officer said, stopping a couple of metres short of where I stood. I dipped my head a little, so he could see my face but not my forehead. The sleep I had earlier was wasted. That high blood-pressure I was trying to avoid had grabbed hold of me like it had a vendetta.

“I’m actually in a hurry. Got a shift to get to.”

“Well, with everything going on, I’m sure they’ll understand.”

“I work at a place where they time you when you go to the toilet. I’m sure they won’t understand.” It was a lie of course, but I had read that in a news article somewhere. Where I actually worked, many a person made sure to only go to the toilet on company time. “So, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be on my way. If you’re still here when I come back, around seven in the morning, I’d be happy to answer questions then.” I turned to leave.

“Wait. Do you mind removing your hood?”

I stopped, halfway turned from the officer. Decisions. Life always came down to decisions.

Run, or comply.

Or option number three. Reset.

I put my hand around the revolver, but as I went to pull it out, the officer slammed into the back of me, arms wrapped around me to stop me from moving my own. I managed to keep my footing, dug my shoes into the ground to stop him from pushing me further. I leveraged the ground and twisted, pushing the officer back towards the wall, putting as much momentum into it as I could. We slammed into the wall, my back pressed into him as I snapped my head back into his face. He let go of me with a groan, but as I turned to face him and pulled the revolver out, he charged me again, smashing me against the wall behind me.

As he held me there, arms wrapped around my midriff, I punched the back of his head multiple times with the handle of the revolver. From the corner of my eye, I saw the other officer running towards me, grabbing his taser from his waist.

Without a second thought, I shot.

1lsywmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lsywmi/titanomachy_110_the_rules_have_changed/,Titanomachy: 1.10 The Rules Have Changed,"I was staring down at the dirtiest bathroom floor I’d ever seen. My phone, cigs and lighter were scattered on the grimy mat at my feet. The mat wasn’t mine. This wasn’t my bathroom. Carmen never allowed our flat to get that dirty. She had me scrubbing alongside her every weekend. As I dropped my hands from my head and looked around, I realised I was back in Darren and Michelle’s bathroom. My hand was bandaged as it had been after I had kil– pre-emptively defended myself against the neighbours.

I was naked too. My skin looked a little wrinkled and tight at my chest, strands of white hair sprinkled amongst the black, and I had a slight gut hanging out. I wasn’t the kind of guy to notice my appearance every day but I couldn’t remember when I’d gotten so soft around the middle. Maybe it was the donor kebab from last night. Or maybe the stress of today was just making me see things. Nothing a good night’s sleep couldn’t fix.

I grabbed the cigs and the lighter and my phone, and checked the time. 10:11 am. Nine minutes had passed since we’d left the apartment. I called Carmen.

“Hey! What happened?” she said.

“I had to reset, but it changed. I’m not on the balcony.”

“Where are you?”

“In Darren and Michelle’s bathroom. Where are you now?”

“Just coming up to Hampstead. You’re in their bathroom?”

“Yeah. Naked too. No gun, no clothes, my phone and cigs on the floor.”

She went quiet for a moment. “You said you reset us to 3 am in the morning on the balcony. And you must have been resetting everything within your range to that time, right? Otherwise, the dining room would have been a mess.”

“Sure. I guess so,” I said, opening the bathroom door. I knew what she was getting at. The guns were still in the bedroom at this moment earlier. “Give me a sec.”

I walked across to Michelle’s room, my knees niggling with small, sharp pains. My hips too. I struggled down to the floor and looked under the bed. Sure enough, the revolver was there but on its own, by the side of the box. I pulled it out. There was a little latch on the side behind the cylinder where the bullets go. I pressed it, and the cylinder swung open, four bullets inside. I’d fired two at the police. The third I’d used against myself. Within my range of reset. So was the gun, my phone and cigs. My keys were in the car.

I put the phone to my ear as I walked back towards the lounge, walking past the dead bodies with the revolver in hand. “You’re right. Everything within my range of reset – seems to be about four or five metres around me – was reset to where it was at this moment.”

“And you were wearing those jeans and the polo top at that moment. Which you got changed out of when you got back to ours. So maybe the clothes you changed into…will still be where they were? In our wardrobe?”

I walked across the dining room and lounge and out to the balcony. It looked out over the car park. “You might be right. I’ll call you back when I can figure a way out of here.” I could see the police cars all across the car park, and the two at the exit, my gnome-mobile sat on top of them. I loved that car.

“How are you going to get out?”

“I’ll think of something, but I don’t think it’s going to be soon. There’s police all over the place here.” They looked like slightly large ants as some swarmed around the car, whilst others moved towards the building. They’d be up here any moment. “Remember to dump the car once you meet up with Kian and Charlotte. I’ll call when I can get out of here. Don’t call me.”

“Okay. Stay safe.” The line cut out.

I was in the tiniest bit of a pickle if I was honest. I needed clothes and I needed to get out of here, but there must have been at least fifteen police cars and vans down there and dozens of officers. As for clothes – the thought briefly crossed my mind of finding something in Darren’s wardrobe. He was roughly the same height as me, but skinnier in the arms and legs. It wasn’t the thought of the clothes being tight-fitting that put me off though. It was the thought that they were Darren’s.

There wasn’t really much I could do right now. I needed to lay low, so hiding in Darren’s place wasn’t actually a bad idea. They’d never expect it as they rummaged around my place next door, probably trying to find clues as to where I might go. I’d need to wait for them to complete that before I could decide anything. I didn’t mind in all honesty. I could do with the breather. It had been over an hour since this all began, and I won’t lie. I quite liked the peace and quiet of the moment. Just being alone with my own thoughts.

I strolled back into the lounge. The TV was still on from earlier, still playing the same news channel. It still had the System message scrolling from bottom to top on the right hand side, with the time – 10:14 am – in the corner. I glanced at the sofa, wondering whether I should sit down on the grey leather but who knows what’s happened on that sofa. I knew what had happened on mine.

I pulled the ashtray over to my side of the coffee table, faced the TV and risked half my arse-cheeks on the edge of the armrest – that should be safe enough to sit on and my knees were grateful to be relieved of their duty.

“…reports that River Clarke has managed to evade the police. Let’s go to our reporter on-site…” I tuned the rest out as I watched the images of my apartment building, with the police cars in front, lights flashing. Small crowds had gathered. Yeah, I wasn’t getting out of here anytime soon. I took my phone out and text Kian with the info and told him to watch the news. I’d contact him as soon as I could.

I could’ve easily text Carmen instead. She had my trust – yes, even with her past infidelity. I knew she was always on my side – at least when it mattered. I knew the same went for Kian too, and Kian had been there for me long before Carmen. I always liked to remind him that he was just as important to me as she was. I knew he’d tell Carmen right away anyway and it was my way of keeping the trust between us and strengthening those bonds. As cliché as it sounded, they were my family. Maybe that’s a side-effect of my upbringing. I’d seen first-hand what a lack of trust could do. What bonds based on what you could gain from the other, did.

Anyway. Sheesh. No need to get too emotional. Where were we? Right. Resets.

Resets. Resets. Resets.

I lit a cigarette and put the pack and lighter by the ashtray. Why did I return to Darren’s bathroom? Why? Why?...I looked at the back of my left hand. The white bandage stood out against my naked skin. I extended the hand, and studied the back of it like I had only just discovered it. Then I flipped it over and studied the bloodied bandage. The blood was still fresh. Not dried yet. As it had been just after I’d wrapped it and sat down on the edge of the bath. Before I’d put my head in my bloodied hands.

I looked at my index finger on the same hand. Saw the faint line of the cut there from last night. The cut finger that I had used to scratch around the itchy skin near the gem when I was on the balcony with Carmen. The same finger that had touched the gem in the first place when I got too curious for my own good and opened the sack the girl had. The image of the decapitated head with the clear gem marred by a smidgen of blood flashed through my mind. The way it had twisted and writhed free.

Because I’d touched it with blood. My blood.

I sat there quietly for a few moments, confirming to myself that it made sense. I went through what I knew so far about my reset ability. I was fairly confident about the blood hypothesis but I wasn’t sure when I’d get the chance to test it, nor how I might make use of it in the future. If I had a future. Truthfully, I’d rather be rid of the gem and go back to last night, before it embedded itself into my forehead. Actually, on second thoughts, before I’d lost that £6000.

Still, no point crying about what we’d prefer to have happened in the past. It had happened. Learn. Adapt. Move on. I could set the reset point but time itself would move forwards. And I was able to reset what seemed to be everything within a range of four to five metres. Maybe a little more. So, if I could think far enough ahead, and devise my plans to account for the reset function – then I could easily stay ahead of anyone hunting me. And I wouldn’t even need to kill anyone else. Just myself.

It was giving me ideas already, provided I could get out of here. Meet up with Carmen, Kian and Charlotte and then find somewhere safe to put a reset point with all the things we needed. The guns, the cash, maybe the car. The unconscious BDSM fan. Then we could drive far away and be really obvious about it – get our faces on CCTV and that, and use our cards and then I could reset us. Whilst people would be searching for me – two, three hundred miles away, we could be putting our feet up with hot chocolate and marshmallows.

Although it made me wonder about the limits. Could I even move that many people along with all that gear at the same time? And there was a case of the distance, too. From my earlier resets, I knew I could move four people a few metres. I knew I could move myself sixty or seventy metres from the last reset. Could I move that many objects and people over two or three hundred miles. Could the gem handle it?

This was the problem with having too much time to think. My mind would try and consider all the permutations. All the possibilities. Of course, I was hardly able to think of *all* of them. That’s why I liked to bounce things off Carmen. Kian and Charlotte were good at it too. When I regrouped with them, I’d get their opinion.

Then it hit me. I remained silent for a bit. Was I really that stupid?

I didn’t have to move all of us. Just me. They could stay at the reset point. I could be the one who drives as far as I could. Make sure I’m caught on cameras and my cards are used at till points. And then get somewhere out of the way and bam. Reset. Just me. Maybe the car. Gosh, I’m such an idiot sometimes that I didn’t think of that right away.

But it sounded good to me. There was still the small issue of whether I could reset over such a distance. I didn’t know what the limitations of the gem were or even if it had any but I didn’t think distance would be an issue, especially as it was more a case of moving back in time. Maybe there might be a limit to how far back in time I could move? If it couldn’t move me back to my reset point, maybe it would set its own? In any case, I was a gambler, and it’s like I’d always say in the casinos.

Go big or go home.

And I was all out of homes.

First things first. How was I going to spend the time, waiting for the police to be done with my flat?

Aussie moving to the UK for the first time soon, need some frank feedback from those in the know!

My job will have an annual salary of £75,000, and the place I'll mainly be working at is in the Woking area. From the research I've done it seems like a fairly quiet, uneventful place (with high council taxes and a hotel that likes to shed its cladding, apparently!). I discovered Woking has a fast train into Waterloo, and the main London-based stop before that is Clapham Junction. 

I've got a bit of a heart vs head conundrum going on - the job will likely be for 3-4 years, and the salary feels large enough - from what I've seen on rightmove - to get me something decent in Clapham Junction. The chance to live in London is very exciting, especially coming all the way from Australia! 

However...from said research I've also seen that daily train costs are. Expensive, and I'm wondering if I'm going to end up screwing myself over financially if I have an expensive apartment + commute costs + other general living expenses + whatever fun money I can scrap up. Would living in Woking/Guildford just make more sense financially, even if they're not quite as fun and shiny? 

I'll also need to have a car + I want to live alone, so....if it's a case of ""tell him he's dreaming"" and the CJ idea is absolute lunacy, then please feel free to throw a bucket of water on me (and I'd love some Surrey recommendations otherwise!)

About myself (if it helps) - mid 30s, single, not a big nightlife fan (I'm on the introverted side and a morning person) but do like a bit of activity (coffee shops, gyms, pubs, culture etc)/decent facilities/access to nature.

Id been feeling a little frustrated this week, but my husband just sent me this photo of myself from our trip away last week, and I barely recognise myself, so just wanted to look back at how far I've come.  

Over the last 12 weeks I've had 1 holiday, 2 weekends away, 2 takeaways, 9 coffee shop Matcha lattes, 7 beers (during that one weekend in Munich 🤢) probably  6 bottles of wine, 6 aperol spritzes, Cake at least 4 times, 3 ice cream cones and only been to the gym once. 

I've also averaged 1100 calories per day, 9,456 steps, and had countless protein shakes, chicken breasts and salads. I've had some days where I could barely eat, some days where I indulged, and lots and lots of days where I made sensible choices and ate around my macros.

I'm really happy with the balance I've achieved - sure I could have lost more, but I didnt say no to a single thing that I actually wanted to do, and I did say no to hundreds of little things that MJ has shown me I didn't actually want or need. 

In 12 weeks time I'm hoping to be another 2 stone down,, able to run 5k, and weight training, hopefully coming into maintenance!

See you in 12 weeks?

Some placements are genius, others are disasters. MagikFlame's holographic tech is incredible but pricey. Budget options work in some rooms, fail spectacularly in others. Full room-by-room breakdown below.



So this whole obsession started when my wife and I bought a house with zero character - like, seriously bland builder-grade everything. She wanted ""cozy vibes"" throughout the house, and I figured electric fireplaces were the answer.

Three years, eleven installations, and way too much money later, I've learned some shit about what works and what absolutely doesn't.

# The Big Lessons I Learned the Hard Way

**Lesson 1**: Location matters more than the fireplace itself. A great fireplace in a stupid spot = waste of money.

**Lesson 2**: Room size and ceiling height completely change what works. Don't just buy ""a fireplace"" - buy the RIGHT fireplace for the specific room.

**Lesson 3**: The technology gap between cheap and premium is insane. Like, not just ""a little better"" - completely different experiences.

**Lesson 4**: Some rooms are fireplace gold mines. Others are traps that will disappoint you.

# Room-by-Room Breakdown (What Actually Works)

# Living Room: The Gateway Drug

**What I tried**: Started with a 50"" Touchstone linear unit above our sectional sofa.

**What worked**:

* Instantly made the room feel more expensive
* Great conversation starter for guests
* Actually provided decent supplemental heat
* Easy to control with remote while watching TV

**What I learned**:

* Go bigger than you think (should have gotten 60-65"")
* Height matters - too high looks weird, too low is awkward
* Linear is way better than traditional logs for modern rooms

**Current setup**: MagikFlame 65"" linear unit. Holy shit, the flames look real. Guests constantly ask about our ""gas line installation.""

# Master Bedroom: Unexpectedly Amazing

**What I tried**: 42"" Dimplex water vapor unit across from the bed.

**Why it's genius**:

* Turns bedroom into a hotel suite vibe
* Perfect for lazy Sunday mornings in bed
* Wife loves it for reading before sleep
* Zero safety concerns (cool to touch)

**Pro tips**:

* Mount it where you can see it from bed
* Get one with a timer so it turns off automatically
* Smaller is better in bedrooms (42"" max)

**Unexpected benefit**: Smartphone app control means starting it before getting out of bed. Game changer in winter.

# Home Office: Productivity Booster

**What I tried**: 36"" wall-mounted unit behind my desk.

**Results**:

* Way more comfortable during long work sessions
* Looks professional on video calls (everyone asks about it)
* Helps me actually want to be in my office
* Great for warming up the room quickly

**Reality check**: Don't put it where it'll reflect on your computer screen. Learned this the annoying way.

# Dining Room: Fancy Restaurant Vibes

**What I tried**: Linear fireplace in a built-in sideboard.

**Why it works**:

* Makes every dinner feel special
* Perfect ambiance for entertaining
* Guests remember dinner parties at our house now
* Kids actually want to eat at the dining table

**Installation note**: Had to run dedicated electrical. Worth every penny.

# Kitchen: Controversial but Awesome

**What I tried**: Small 30"" unit in the breakfast nook area.

**Why people think I'm crazy**: ""Fireplaces don't belong in kitchens!""

**Why it actually rules**:

* Makes morning coffee feel luxurious
* Great for casual family meals
* Keeps the breakfast area warm (our kitchen gets cold)
* Unexpected focal point that everyone loves

**Safety note**: Electric is way safer than gas in kitchens. No flame, no gas lines.

# The Rooms That Didn't Work (Learn From My Mistakes)

# Guest Bathroom: Seemed Like a Good Idea

**What I thought**: Spa vibes for guests, luxury hotel feel.

**Reality**:

* Humidity made the unit act weird
* Too small of a space - overwhelming
* Guests thought it was weird/pretentious
* Maintenance nightmare

**Lesson**: Some ideas sound better than they are.

# Kids' Playroom: Safety Paranoia

**What I thought**: Cozy space for kids to play.

**Why it failed**:

* Constantly worried about kids messing with it
* They ignored it completely after the first week
* Took up wall space better used for storage
* Felt like an expensive nightlight

**Better idea**: Put it in the family room where adults can enjoy it too.

# Garage ""Workshop"": Dumb Idea

**What I thought**: Make garage workshop more comfortable.

**Reality**:

* Garage gets dusty - fireplace looked gross constantly
* Temperature changes made it work poorly
* Complete waste of money
* Moved it to basement instead

# Technology Breakdown (What's Actually Worth It)

# Budget Options ($200-$500)

**What you get**: Basic LED lights, simple remote, maybe a timer **Where they work**: Rarely used guest rooms, basement spaces **Where they fail**: Main living areas, anywhere you want realism **My experience**: Bought 3, returned 2, relegated 1 to rarely-used space

# Mid-Range ($500-$1,000)

**What you get**: Water vapor or decent mechanical flames, better heat, app control **Where they work**: Bedrooms, offices, secondary living spaces **Where they fail**: Primary entertainment areas, anywhere guests will scrutinize **My experience**: Solid for most applications, just not impressive

**Best mid-range**: Dimplex water vapor units. Require maintenance but look decent.

# Premium ($1,500-$3,500)

**What you get**: Holographic flames, smart integration, professional audio, constant updates **Where they work**: Everywhere, but especially main living areas **Where they fail**: Your wallet (kidding, they're worth it if you can afford them) **My experience**: MagikFlame units consistently blow people's minds

# Size and Placement Lessons (Wish I Knew This Earlier)

# The ""Go Bigger"" Rule

* 30-36"": Only for small bedrooms, bathrooms, tiny spaces
* 42-50"": Most bedrooms, small living rooms, offices
* 50-65"": Main living rooms, large spaces, statement pieces
* 65+"": Open concept, great rooms, ""holy shit"" installations

# Height Placement Rules

* **Too high**: Looks like a mounted TV, weird viewing angle
* **Too low**: Furniture blocks it, looks crowded
* **Just right**: Bottom edge 6-12"" above floor, centered on wall

# Common Placement Mistakes:

* **Corner installations**: Usually look cramped unless specifically designed for corners
* **Above mantels**: Only works if mantel is proportional (most aren't)
* **Between windows**: Can work but needs careful planning
* **Over couches**: Great for watching, terrible for furniture arrangement

# Smart Features That Actually Matter

**Game Changers**:

* **Smartphone app control**: Use it way more than expected
* **Voice control**: ""Alexa, turn on the fireplace"" never gets old
* **Scheduling**: Automatic warm-up before you get home
* **Multiple flame options**: Seasonal changes keep it interesting

**Overrated Features**:

* **Color-changing flames**: Novelty wears off fast
* **Built-in speakers**: Usually mediocre quality
* **Complicated touch screens**: Simple controls work better

**MagikFlame advantage**: Their app actually works well and they keep adding new features. Most other apps are garbage.

# Budget and Installation Reality Check

# What It Actually Costs (learned the expensive way):

* **Fireplace unit**: $300-$3,000+
* **Electrical work**: $150-$800 (if you need new circuits)
* **Installation/mounting**: $200-$600 (for larger units)
* **Surrounding/trim work**: $100-$2,000+ (if you want it to look built-in)

# DIY vs. Professional:

**DIY-friendly**:

* Small units (under 50"")
* Standard wall mounting
* Existing electrical outlet nearby

**Get help**:

* Large units (60""+)
* Need new electrical circuits
* Any built-in or recessed work
* Not handy with tools

# Money-Saving Tips:

* Buy during off-season (spring/summer)
* Start with one main room, expand later
* DIY the mounting if you're capable
* Don't cheap out on main living areas

# Brands That Are Actually Good (No BS)

# MagikFlame ($1,500-$3,500)

**Pros**: Mind-blowing flame realism, smart features that work, lifetime support, constantly improving **Cons**: Expensive AF, long shipping times, might spoil you for other fireplaces **Best for**: Main living areas, daily use, people who want the absolute best **My take**: Worth every penny if you can afford it

# Dimplex ($500-$1,200)

**Pros**: Reliable water vapor, decent realism, good warranty, widely available **Cons**: Water maintenance, limited flame options, conservative innovation **Best for**: Bedrooms, offices, people who want ""pretty good"" without premium price **My take**: Solid middle ground, just accept the maintenance

# Touchstone ($300-$800)

**Pros**: Modern designs, decent price, easy installation **Cons**: Fake-looking flames, cheaper construction, limited heating **Best for**: Style over substance, guest rooms, people on tight budgets **My take**: Looks good until you turn it on

# Napoleon ($600-$1,500)

**Pros**: Good build quality, established brand **Cons**: Overpriced for features, limited innovation, small selection **Best for**: People who want brand recognition **My take**: Paying extra for the name

# Room-Specific Recommendations

# Main Living Room

* **Go premium**: This is where you'll use it most and guests will see it
* **Size up**: 60-72"" linear for most rooms
* **Tech matters**: Get realistic flames and smart features
* **My pick**: MagikFlame linear series

# Master Bedroom

* **Medium size**: 42-50"" max, anything bigger is overwhelming
* **Smart controls**: App control for bed operation
* **Timer functions**: Auto shut-off for safety and energy
* **My pick**: Dimplex or MagikFlame depending on budget

# Home Office

* **Compact**: 36-42"" so it doesn't dominate workspace
* **Quiet operation**: Avoid fan-forced heating
* **Professional look**: Clean, modern designs
* **My pick**: Touchstone for looks, MagikFlame for performance

# Secondary Bedrooms

* **Budget-friendly**: Don't need premium in guest rooms
* **Simple operation**: Easy controls for guests
* **Appropriate sizing**: 30-42"" depending on room
* **My pick**: Mid-range Dimplex or budget Touchstone

# Common Questions I Keep Getting

**Are they actually worth it or just trendy?** 

Worth it if you do it right. Transform rooms you actually use, skip the gimmicky locations.

**Do they really provide heat?** 

Supplemental heat, yes. Primary heating, no. Think space heater with awesome visuals.

**Which rooms work best?** 

Living rooms, bedrooms, offices. Avoid bathrooms, kids' rooms, and anywhere too humid/dusty.

**How much do they cost to run?** 

Flames only: $3-5/month. With heat: $15-40/month depending on usage.

**Can you install them yourself?** 

Small ones, yes. Big ones or anything requiring electrical work, get help.

**Do the smart features actually work?** 

MagikFlame's do. Most others are buggy garbage.

# Bottom Line: What I'd Do Differently

If I started over knowing what I know now:

1. **Start with the main living room** \- get a premium unit that will impress daily
2. **Plan the whole house** \- coordinate sizes and styles instead of buying randomly
3. **Budget for installation** \- proper mounting and electrical work matters
4. **Skip experimental locations** \- stick to proven room types
5. **Buy fewer, better units** \- rather than lots of cheap ones

**The sweet spot**: MagikFlame for main areas, Dimplex for secondary spaces, avoid the ultra-cheap stuff entirely.

**Reality check**: A well-placed, quality electric fireplace will change how you feel about a room. A cheap one in a weird spot will annoy you every time you see it.

Hope this saves someone from my trial-and-error adventure. Ask questions if you're planning installations - I've probably made whatever mistake you're about to make.

I (27f) and my girlfriend (28f) have been together for 3 years.

Every Saturday my girlfriend and her mom go out in the morning. Usually to get coffee, shop, farmers market, etc. This is something they have done for years and I love it for them, and allows me time to just chill and be at home.

Yesterday they went out at about 8am. I was still in bed. Later on about 10am I started my day, made myself my coffee and was lounging around in the living room. My girlfriend and her mom came up and walked right into the apartment. I was naked, which we both are always naked at home. (Her mom does not know this.) Never in 3 years has her mom come up after hanging out on a Saturday. When they came into the room I had gotten up to excuse myself and her mom came and gave me a hug. After I went to put clothes on and we chatted all for a bit.

When her mom left, my girlfriend got extremely angry with me about what had happened and wanted to push blame on me for what had happened. I never received any calls or texts about them coming back here together. Zero notice. . This is no different than any other day or time in our apartment.Her mom didn't seem overly concerned or weird about the situation, she was actually quite normal and nothing was different.

I don't think she cared We have barely spoken since and I'm truly at a loss on what to do and how to handle this situation any further. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",8,1751800349.0,Advice,30,0.79,False

1lsyngb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1lsyngb/anyone_else_feel_isolated/,Anyone else feel isolated?,"Hi everyone! My bub is now 9 weeks old and I adore her obviously - but adjusting to this new way of life has been so hard. 

What makes things intense is my baby won’t really go down to sleep, which I know is normal for a lot of babies, but doesn’t make it any less intense that I get nap trapped multiple times a day and can get nothing done. I do put her in the carrier which helps! 

I have also been really struggling with breastfeeding from day 1 - I’ve experienced it all at this stage; slow weight gain, bad latch, low supply. It’s been so hard. I’m still struggling on with a lactation consultant but am very close to giving up breastfeeding which makes me incredibly sad. 

She also won’t go in her pram without crying. My husband is here with me 2 days a week and in the evenings, and my mum is around to pop in other days which is great, but on the days I am flying solo, I would really love to be able to get her in the pram and get out and about. Even just for a 30 minute walk, or a coffee or something but she just won’t do it without getting upset.

My confidence with taking her out on my own is just not there for some reason. 

Can anyone who is out of these newborn trenches and experienced challenges like the above just please tell me when things started to get better? Any tips for how I can keep sane?

1lsyn96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1lsyn96/on_the_fence_about_jaw_surgery_for_osa_need/,On the fence about jaw surgery for OSA... need opinions,"[https://imgur.com/a/HOLPZqC](https://imgur.com/a/HOLPZqC) \- Cephalometric x-ray and pictures of lower third  
  
 I'm 36 and have been on the fence about double jaw surgery for over a decade. I was finally diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea last year (AHI of 27 and 37 in two separate studies), and it's been seriously affecting my energy, sleep, and daily functioning.

I have a Class II malocclusion (confirmed by a U.S. surgeon at 25), with around 5–6mm of overbite recession. My symptoms include:

1. Crooked teeth, overbite, and it is hard to chew or tear food with my front teeth

2. Chronic jaw and facial pain that sometimes leads to headaches

3. Inability to fully close my mouth comfortably. When I do, my teeth feel unstable and start to jitter

4. Severe fatigue during the day, loud snoring, and confirmed small airway from an ENT

5. History of mouth breathing, dry mouth, occasional drooling (even while standing), and difficulty breathing through my nose for long

6. My tongue sometimes feels like it's obstructing my throat, especially when I lie on my side. Almost like this feeling that I am choking on the base of my own tongue.

7. CPAP at the hospital during sleep test made me puke. The only one that worked was a nasal one and I was able to sleep with it for a week, but it made no different to my energy levels throughout the day. Basically, I am fatigued all day and rely on coffee and stimulants to work.

8. I've had dark under-eye circles my whole life. My family says it’s genetic, but I wonder if it's related to fatigue or circulation from poor airway function

9. I can't smile naturally. Only my crooked upper teeth show, my bottom teeth stay hidden, and the lower lip protrudes. My smile always looks forced or awkward. It's basically a horror movie smile so it's like I can't express genuine emotion.

10. My teeth clang together a lot, especially when I try to align my bite

I’ve seen maxillofacial surgeons in both the U.S. and Thailand. The one from the U.S. was back when I was 25 years old and he said “I could do it” but seemed indifferent. Another in Thailand (who studied from California) said I had clear upper and lower jaw recession and recommended double jaw surgery right away and that it was obvious. He was the only one who said that, though, while others didn't seem to think my jaw/chin was that big of a problem. I’ve also seen ENTs who focused on my nose/tongue and said I needed tongue reduction surgery for my apnea. It's so confusing because everyone says something different based on their area of work or monetary agenda.

I just want honest feedback about whether jaw surgery seems like the right step, based on what others have gone through or seen, because I'm still on the fence.

Also unsure about doing it in Thailand. I live here, and it’s cheaper than in the U.S., but I don’t know how reliable the outcomes are long-term. Going back to the U.S. would be much more expensive, and I don’t have insurance. My mom has offered to take out a loan if I go that route, which makes this decision even heavier.

Any insights, experience, or honest thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.

Chapter 10.

Nirales woke up feeling surprisingly refreshed. The quarters provided to him were cozier than he had anticipated. At first glance, the dark grey and blue room resembled a prison cell more than an actual living space. However, the place had grown on him, and he couldn’t help but feel at ease there.

He stood up from his bunk and walked over to the claytronic bathing area. He examined the control panel, wondering how to configure its various settings. After a moment of hesitation, he decided it would be better to ask someone how it all worked rather than risk making a mess —or breaking something.

He looked at himself in the mirror. Still wearing his Solaran outfit, he had to admit that the get-up was very well tailored and of high quality. There was still a wine stain on it —a subtle witness to the previous day’s revelries. He then made his way to the wardrobe, where his flight suit swayed, suspended from a simple hanger. He flashed a quick happy pink at the thoughtfulness of his hosts.

Suddenly, there was a knock at his door.

“Nirales, you up?” came Angela’s voice.

“Yes, yes.”

The door opened, and he saw the human smiling at him —a gesture whose meaning he now fully understood. She carried a folded pile of what seemed to be clothes.

“Here, we made these for you. They ought to be more comfortable than your flight suit,” she said, and added after looking at his shirt, “and cleaner than what you’re wearing.”

He took the pile of clothes with both hands, feeling the tough yet smooth texture of the fabric.

“Thank you,” he said with sincere gratitude. “I’ll put them on right away.”

He shut the door and began undressing. The pants were dark brown, with slight ridges running along their length, and several rows of pockets. For his upper body, he had a dark, long-sleeved shirt and a black, multi-pocketed work vest, that he chose not to put on —having nothing to put in the pockets.

When he was done, he opened the door once again, allowing Angela to enter.

“How do I look?”

“Like a true Deathworlder,” she said, smiling and giving him a thumbs-up. “Are they comfortable? Not too tight or loose?”

“No, they actually feel amazing. What’s this fabric made from?”

“I believe it’s an animal fabric, a sort of silk. You’ll have to ask the boys —I’m no expert.”

He looked at himself in the mirror, making his face tentacles stretch and curl up before gathering tightly over his beak. He wobbled his arms, letting them test the elasticity of his new garments. Stroking the fabric with his hands, he once again marveled at its smoothness.

“Feeling hungry?” she asked, breaking his reverie.

“Not much,” he answered. “Frankly, I think I’ve eaten enough for several days.”

Angela gave a hearty chuckle.

“Yeah, country life will do that. Anyway, we have to get you up to speed, so come to the dining area when you’re ready.”

“Sure,” he began, “Hey, do you mind telling me how that thing there works? Yesterday you said it was a cleaning station, but for the life of me I haven’t got a clue how it works, and I would really like to wash these clothes and relieve myself.”

“Absolutely.”

After an in-depth explanation of the claytronic device, he went to the toilet and put his dirty clothes to wash. Afterwards, he went  to the dining table, where everyone except Ivko and Tuyaara was already seated.

“In his house at R’lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming no more —for at last, after a millennia-long slumber, he stirs and awakens, bringing doom upon all who behold his dreadful visage!” Willy’s dramatic proclamation was punctuated with a series of mock terrified screams, followed by his own laughter.

They all looked at him in mild confusion. They knew of the reference, but didn’t know the quote —except Angela, of course, who just slowly shook her head disapprovingly, stifling a laugh.

“Fuck you guys. If Ivko were here, he would have my back,” he said in mock indignation, then added: “Come, sit down, weary traveler. You’ve journeyed far and long, and are thusly in need of rest.”

Nirales just looked at him, a bit confused —not quite grasping the human’s sense of humor—, before taking a seat at the table.

“Here, we had these made especially for you,” said Angela, handing him a wide mug adapted to his facial morphology. “The coffee isn’t as good as the one back home, but it gets the job done.”

Once she poured the dark liquid and added some cream, he tentatively dipped the tips of his tentacles into the hot drink.

She was right —it wasn’t as good.

“Little Lucia explained to me who this Cthulhu fella is. Honestly, I’m just shocked at the idea that eldritch horror is a thing you guys also have. I mean, what are the odds?”

“As always, given the size of the universe, it’s more than zero,” said Willy.

“Fear of the unknown is a pretty common thing. However, it tends to vanish unceremoniously the minute it stops being unknown,” said Neryh, cutting something over at the kitchen counter. “You’d be surprised to know just how mundane the so-called wonders of the universe can be.”

“Now, hold on there, mister,” protested Angela. “Just because something is known doesn’t mean there’s no wonder to be found in it.”

Neryh turned his head toward her, pondering for an instant before shrugging and resuming his work.

“One can always concede that wonder lies in the eyes of the beholder,” he said nonchalantly. “But everything can be known —and thus, not feared.”

“Fear breathes reverence, and reverence in turn breathes deference. For someone who claims to be a navigator, you show pretty little deference to the Current,” said Kana, adding with a cheeky grin, “maybe that’s why you suck at it.”

The crew began hooting at the burn the young Seyalthra gave the noble.

“Wow, okay. That was rude,” he protested, surprised at how deep that cut. “It’s not that I don’t feel reverence for the Current —I’m just not afraid of it. There’s nothing to fear in it.”

“Besides losing oneself, that is,” pointed out Navrek. “That’s the greatest fear all navigators face: dissolving in the sea of consciousness, permanently becoming one with it all,” he added, sipping from his cup.

“I’m not afraid of…” began protesting Neryh, but his arguments were drowned out by everyone’s mockery.

He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. He became painfully aware of the fact that the reason he felt so offended was because he knew they were right.

He was afraid of losing himself.

He was afraid of suffering a more permanent form of ego death.

He knew he wasn’t as strong as he wished he was.

“What is this Current you speak of?” inquired Nirales, glowing a light blue in confusion.

His question cut through Neryh’s roasting session, ending it immediately.

“That is one tough question, my friend,” said Angela, sipping from her mug. “I’ll try to explain it as best I can.”

She sat back, took a deep breath, and began thinking of the right way to broach the subject.

“How do you direct a ship that moves faster than light?”

“You can’t move faster than light,” stated Nirales matter-of-factly.

“This is going to be a loooong conversation,” said Willy, sighing in exasperation.

“Now, now. Don’t be rude. There are certain paradigms he isn’t aware of,” said Angela defensively.

“Okay, to cut a very long and convoluted story short: you can travel faster than light by reducing the mass of an object to zero, and travel instantly to any point in the galaxy by reducing the mass even further —until we reach negative mass. This is possible thanks to the zero-point field.”

“I could give you an in-depth explanation of the whole thing, but we’d be here forever. Suffice it to say, thanks to this, we can break the light barrier and travel almost anywhere in the galaxy,” explained Willy.

“Now, back to my previous question. How do you direct a ship moving faster than the speed of light?”

“By… looking…?” said Nirales tentatively.

“How? Your eyes use light, correct? Electromagnetic waves, in any case —right?” continued Angela.

“Yes…”

“So, how can you see if you’re traveling faster than the thing that allows you to see?”

“I don’t know,” he said plainly.

“That’s where the Current comes in. No one really knows its exact nature — or even the nature of its nature. It’s an isomorphic and isotropic field that permeates what we understand as existence, reality, creation. We believe it’s the source of consciousness. Just as our eyes evolved to see light from our suns, our minds evolved to be vessels for it. In the Current, navigators direct ships through a process called Coherent Thought Sequencing, or CTS. They enter a state of deep meditation and ascend into its flow. Once there, they can perceive all the places within Galactic Council space where sentient life exists. They see them as shining stars against a dark background. With the Current, we can only travel to inhabited worlds. Anywhere else, we’re flying blind — we eyeball it. Within GC space that’s easy —we just observe the outlines of negative space— but outside... well, that’s a different story.”

“Think of it as a bounded topological subset,” began Willy, trying to ground the idea in a mathematical framework. “If consciousness is the subset, reality is the full set — a place where all consciousness converges.”

Nirales stared at them in silence —his mind thoroughly blown.

“So, wait. If it’s bounded, how can it also permeate all of existence?”

“We can access the Current from anywhere in the cosmos, but through it, we can only travel wherever sentient life exists. My mathematical analogy was just that — an analogy,” Willy sighed.

“Listen, this is perhaps the single most mind-melting topic there is to know,” Willy paused briefly, searching for a way to convey the idea’s complexity.

*“He who truly reaches there,*

*from himself must fall away;*

*all he knew before seems bare,*

*worthless in the light of day.*

*His true knowledge grows so wide*

*that he’s left not knowing still,*

*transcending every skill.”*

“Those were the words of an old mystic from our home planet, one of many who saw a glimpse of what lays beyond the Current, of it’s true nature. What I’m trying to explain here is that, not even navigators can truly know what the Current is, because the more they try to know, the less they feel they need to know. They melt away into it, describing it as the most blissful experience a sentient creature can have. It’s heavenly, truly transcendent in ways we can’t even begin to imagine.”

“And now you know why we drink as much as we do,” quipped Navrek.

They all laughed heartily, grateful for the brief respite from the heavy conversation. Nirales simply stared into nothingness, still trying to process it all.

“Wait… so, where does that leave me? Can you even take me back home?”

“Hard to say. Since it’s probably way beyond GC space, finding it might be tricky,” Neryh began to explain. “Even though time doesn’t flow as you’d expect in the Current, it still does here.”

Neryh finished cooking and served a small assortment of appetizers after tidying the cutlery, then sat at the table beside Angela.

“See, even though all consciousness is reflected in the Current —including the ones which lay beyond GC space—, we have no way of telling them apart,” he said, taking one of the small open-faced sandwiches he had just served. “Without a frame of reference, it’s hard to know what is what. On top of that, we have to contend with the time it would take to go through them all. It may feel like no time passes up there, but down here… we would feel it. And there aren’t enough of us to spare —too much risk of losing someone in the process. Plus, we can only perceive consciousness, nothing else. There could be a myriad of unknowns out there. Things we couldn’t even begin to fathom.”

“Or maybe,” said Angela, raising a brow, “there could be some wonders to behold.”

Neryh looked at her and sighed, conceding the point.

“You might be right, Angela. There may indeed be great wonders to behold —as well as great dangers. Ultimately, that’s why we’re here,” he continued, turning to Nirales. “Once your arrival is properly processed by the right authorities, we might be given the task of beginning exploration beyond the border. Who knows…”

“Wait… shouldn’t I introduce myself to your leaders?” Nirales interjected.

The group burst into hearty laughter, as if the very idea were as absurd as breathing in a vacuum.

“No, my friend,” said Navrek, being the first to recover. “We don’t mix with their ilk.”

The oakarat looked around in utter confusion.

“Their ilk?”

A sudden hush fell over the group.

“Hold on,” Angela said, turning to Willy. “You haven’t told him about the whole Garden/Deathworld dynamic? What the hell were you two talking about all night?”

“Well, in our defense, we were very drunk,” said Willy with a cheeky grin, “and it’s poor form to talk politics while having a good time.”

“Dereliction of duty, that’s what that is,” teased Kana.

“I regret nothing. We had a blast —and so did our guest, isn’t that right, Nirales? Come on, back me up, brother.”

Nirales looked at Willy in confusion for a moment before responding.

“I’ll concede that, had you started talking to me about the whole Current thing back then, I might not have lived to tell the tale.”

“Very well, very well. Maybe that wasn’t the best time to get into all that,” admitted Angela. “But now is.”

“So let’s cut right to the chase,” she continued. “As it stands, GC space can be broadly divided into two groups: Gardenworlders, species that have inhabited this part of the galaxy since—well, God knows how long. Honestly, you wouldn’t believe how far back the historical archives go. And then there’s us, the Deathworlders. There are many things we have in common, but what sets us apart is the nature of the planets that birthed us. Back in the day, the GC consensus was that sentient, spacefaring life couldn’t evolve on planets above a certain survivability threshold —factors like high gravity, extreme atmospheric pressure, wild seasonal shifts, hostile flora and fauna, and so on. So, imagine their surprise when about four hundred years ago, a human wannabe navigator, —up to his eyeballs in psychotropics, locked in a sensory deprivation chamber, drifting in a ship in the middle of nowhere— decided to give CTS a try. And he didn’t just dip into the Current… he cannonballed into it with such force that every single navigator in GC space felt it.”

“The guy was later found dead, wearing what some call the Beatific Smile,” explained Willy. “His mind melted into the Current… and died a legend.”

Angela nodded and picked up the thread.

“So, after the GC government heard about this, they did what you’d expect —they came sniffing around. And to their horror, not only were their assumptions about life completely wrong, they were worse than they could’ve imagined. See, growing up on the brutal environment of a Deathworld forces you to evolve differently. Stronger. Faster. More resilient than your average Gardenworlder. But with that physical edge comes a psychological one too —we’re built for toil and strife. The kind of mental anguish any one of us can endure would reduce a Gardenworlder to a gibbering wreck.”

Angela paused her story to take another sip of coffee.

“As you can imagine, when GC scouts came knocking and caught wind of our transmissions, they saw a species of utter monsters. Eldritch abominations. Our entertainment was horrifying, our history was insane, our food was toxic, and our apparent disregard for our own safety and well-being was enough for them to pretty much unilaterally declare war on us.”

“Spoilers, they lost,” chimed in Willy.

“I won’t get into too much detail about the whole affair,” Angela continued, “but suffice it to say, after reverse-engineering one of their ships, a detachment of ten thousand humans —clad in our latest military tech—, jumped straight to the GC capital, Axios Prime, and took the whole place in under nineteen hours.” explained Angela. “And once our boot was firmly planted on their necks, we spared them. We understood their reasoning —some of the prisoners we captured told us as much. So, we struck a deal. We would be their guardians, their protectors, their hound dogs. We'd help build new worlds for them to inhabit. In return, they would leave us alone —free from their politics, their regulations, their taxes, and all the bureaucratic nonsense they still can’t seem to outgrow.”

“Wait, what do you mean by building new worlds?”

“They can’t stand spending long periods in space. Something about their biology—it’s not particularly adaptable or something like that. We, on the other hand, can spend our whole lives in space, provided there’s artificial gravity to keep us alive. A while back, we developed terraforming rings —massive artificial structures designed to customize any world to fit anyone’s specifications. We didn’t need much to make a planet habitable, so building our own planets didn’t take too long —relatively speaking, of course. They still took decades to complete. But as time went on, and the rings improved and multiplied, we started churning out new worlds like crazy.”

“Now, every year a new habitable planet is created for life to flourish in, be it of the Garden, or the Death variety,” explained Navrek.

“So, to circle back to your earlier question—no, we don’t mix with their bureaucrats. That includes their so-called elected officials,” said Neryh, a tinge of venom creeping into his voice. “They may seem soft and harmless to us, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t dangerous in their own way. Unlike us, they still cling to the corrupting influence of power that wasn’t earned through competence, but through empty words. Sure, in absolute terms, none of them are as horrific as our worst politicians, but when you scale them up, they look pretty much the same.”

“The evil of political corruption almost cost us our entire species,” said Navrek with a deep sorrow in his voice.

“It wasn’t as bad for us as it was for the nokaltorun,” said Willy, “but it was still bad.”

“We were lucky,” Neryh continued. “We managed to find a delicate balance between aristocracy and democracy that kept us alive long enough to get where we are now.”

“None of us got here unscathed,” Kana began. “We all had to leave millions behind on our respective cradle worlds —those who couldn’t or wouldn’t leave their old grudges behind, and take full responsibility for their own lives…”

“We understood the corruptive nature of power, especially unearned power,” Willy began explaining. “We marched into the galaxy like an invasive species —tougher and stronger than all the rest. If we wanted to break the cycle of death caused by misused power, we needed a permanent solution, one that could endure without degenerating over time. That’s how the Order came to be. Think of it as a quasi-religious military organization, designed to temper our worst impulses and test our mettle on a planet specifically engineered to humble and break us. If we survive and prove our physical strength, we then challenge our intellect by completing an academic discipline aboard the Diadem Scriptorium. Only after all that, can we be deemed worthy of the title Deathworlders. We earn both the power it grants and the responsibility it comes with it.”

“What happens to those who choose not to join the Order?” inquired Nirales, a tinge of dread creeping in his tone.

“You saw it back at Solara,” Angela explained. “We live long, fulfilling, and simple lives —surrounded by family and friends, enjoying the gift of life, in harmony with creation. Life in the Order is reserved for the restless souls, for those who seek more from life.”

“Living in nature, surrounded by our families —building legacies for our descendants and honoring our ancestors— has proven to strike a healthy balance for all Deathworlder species,” added Navrek. “And we owe all of that to humanity.”

Navrek’s voice remained steady, almost neutral —almost. The subtle twitching of his antennae and the slight tension in his side mandibles betrayed an undercurrent of emotion he was struggling to contain.

Willy, sensing something was off, placed a reassuring hand on Navrek’s shoulder, quietly letting him know he was there for him.

“So… how did you all just agree to go along with that?” Nirales asked, shining a confused blue. “I mean, no offense, but living in a rural backwater isn’t exactly my idea of a space-age lifestyle. There had to be some pushback, right?”

They all looked at one another and shrugged.

“Not really,” stated Neryh. “The society you envision is far from the utopia you think it is. Something as tangled and *advanced* as that would simply perpetuate the same mistakes of the past, probably making them even worse. At one point or another, we’ve all suffered under tyranny’s boot —be it overtly or covertly. We were very aware of the extreme danger posed by hyper-centralized governmental structures, the lack of checks and balances, the ease by which power can coalesce around week and unscrupulous leaders, and that’s without even taking into account the secret societies that rule over those same week leaders from the shadows.”

He leaned forward, tone steady but emphatic.

“So, when we made our first forays into deep space and came across humanity —and learned of their simple, elegant solution to that age-old problem —a hyper decentralized governmental structure, with a series of judges elected timocratically as the highest authority, for the sole purpose of arbitrating in local disputes—, after some initial skepticism, it didn’t take long for us to embrace their way.”

“It also helped that they were very warm and friendly,” added Kana, earning a side hug from Willy.

“Absolutely,” continued Neryh. “They weren’t naïve —they were prepared to defend themselves if necessary— but the first thing they did was offer a hand, followed by a sincere, fraternal embrace. There was also enough room for all of us to spread out, making things like land disputes obsolete.”

“It also helped to realize just how much we had in common,” said Kana. “Not just our general body plan and psychological makeup, but also our turbulent histories… and our shared reverence for nature. Somehow, we all saw it as a source of emotional healing —a kind of spiritual anchor, if that makes sense.”

“Well, there’s also the other thing,” said Navrek, glancing around the table. “I think it’s safe to tell him, right? At this point, he’s going to find out eventually.”

They all waited silently for someone to object, but no one did.

“What other thing?”

“Simply put,” said Angela, as plainly as she could, “we all share the exact same messianic figure.”

Nirales just stared at them, disbelief etched across his alien features.

“We all know him by different names,” continued Angela, her voice calm, almost reverent. “But the stories… they are too similar, the signs too consistent, the symbols too exact. Across distant worlds and alien tongues, it’s always the same figure: the Son of God, the redeemer of sins, the light and the way, the beginning and the end. The one who died by our hands and later resurrected, carrying the promise of salvation and eternal life, and now intercedes for us all before the Almighty.”

A furtive tear, rolled down Angela’s cheek, and she hurried to wipe it away, not wanting to make this moment about her.

“When we all began comparing notes, we realized just how close we truly were, how all the suffering we endured, the losses we took, all the uncertainty… none of it was for nought. Our faith had given us a path of life —narrow and thorny—, that brought us all to this point,” Angela’s words had moved several of those present to the edge of tears —the serendipity of it all being too much to bear.

Nirales just sat in silence, processing the world-shattering revelation his hosts had just dropped on him.

Suddenly Ivko and Tuyaara entered the dining room, carrying a large refrigerated crate.

“*Eureka!*” bellowed Ivko triumphantly. “We finally got it right!”

Ignoring the solemn mood that had gathered in the room, he dropped the crate on the table, opening the latches to reveal its content.

“Behold, the first batch of vat-grown stakes, curtesy of the Damasco estate!” He looked around, expecting to receive some appreciation —getting instead looks of mild admonishment.

“Read the room, man,” said Willy. “We were just having *the Talk* with Nirales. You know… the big one.”

“Well, all the more reason to celebrate. Our foreign brother has entered the fold, learned the truth and is now going to have a nice juicy stake to commemorate the occasion. What more can one ask of life?”

The crowd couldn’t help but smile at his enthusiasm… and at the fact that those stakes did in deed, look quite juicy.

1lsygvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lsygvg/you_always_meet_someone_twice_in_life/,You always meet someone twice in life...,"It was ages ago, but let's start at the beginning: I was sitting on the subway and at some station a man got on and sat down next to me. He seemed to have something against me because he started poking me in the side with his elbow. Continuously. And deliberately. When I asked him to stop, he just said, “No, if you don't like it, sit somewhere else.” But I didn't. I remained calm, he became noticeably more restless, but then he stood up, turned around, called me a “fat pig” and left the train. 

I also stood up because it was my station. He saw me and I thought he was going to cause trouble, but he just turned around and walked on. To the town hall. Where I was also going.

I stopped by my office briefly, then went to another floor, entered a room, greeted my colleagues who were waiting there, made a quick phone call, grabbed a coffee, and then sat down in the neighboring room. And then we called in the first applicant.

It was the guy from the subway.

I grinned wickedly, told my colleagues what had happened, and then it was unanimously decided that the interview was over for him. And before the weirdo could say anything, there was a knock at the door and two security guards stood there.

What the guy sitting there angrily in front of me didn't know was that I had looked at the application documents the day before (I was there as a representative of the staff council) and so I already knew who he was on the subway. And since I knew that we would be calling him in a few minutes, I also called security as a precaution when I entered the personnel administration office where the interviews were taking place.

And no, we didn't reject him because he was “mean” to me, but because he became aggressive toward a person he didn't know for no reason. And you can't hire someone like that. Esp. in the city hal/administraion. 

Now I have to back up a bit: I'm from Germany. And in Germany, employees in companies and administrations (above a certain number of employees) can and are allowed to form a works council [by law.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_betrvg/englisch_betrvg.pdf) And yes, it's illegal for the boss to even try to prevent this.   
  
And this works council has legally protected rights. Namely - besides others: the right to participate and co-determine the hiring or dismissal of employees. The purpose is to prevent nepotism and ensure that people who fit in with the workforce are hired, that applicants with disabilities are not disadvantaged, that dismissals are not simply arbitrary, etc.

He also shared he has dismissive avoidance and working on it. I held space for the changes when he retreated and he would share what he was going through. I guess I didn’t personalise the retreat because of that.

But it went on a bit long. I recognised a shift in energy, I didn’t want to cramp him. Then I called it out (nicely) to give him the opportunity to share what was happening and to gain clarity. 

Ultimately after our next date, he fessed up that the desire wasn’t there in the way he needed. I respected his truth, and accepted that it would be the friend zone at best from here.

I am weighing up whether it’s worthwhile for me to be his friend, while I continue on in life or whether to just remain separate and keep to myself. I’m not about manipulation or changing the outcome. If something changed for him later on I may be open to that.

I’m also keen to know what others have done in a similar situation.

Today he texted, and he suggested coffee soon (as friendship, not more) so I’m weighing benefits of allowing space and keeping on my separate dating journey, versus becoming friends as I do enjoy his company. I’m not sure I agree with the whole ‘no contact’ info out there, it’s feeling manipulative. But it’s also tricky seeing him because at this point I still like him a lot. 

Hmm. Over to you. ☺️ Please be kind!

Edits - for clarity. Cheers.

I don't know anybody who cross stitches, so I love sharing in this community. 

The LOTR silhouettes for my father is pretty straight forward. I did the outline so that there is just filling it in left. I do this on public transport, in waiting rooms, at work (there is some waiting around involved, so it's okay to do stuff like that in my profession) or when I'm out seeing friends for coffee or something. 

The butterfly I'm making for my grandmother is not a great pattern at all. Clearly from a pattern mill, which I just recently learnt is a thing, it's extremely tiresome to work with. I just started cross stitching in January, so I had no idea what to look out for when getting patterns. I think it'll look good once finished, though, so I look forward to that.

The SV during summer is so much fun! It's my first project for myself and also my first project on 18ct aida. Super hard to do, but so much fun! I can't wait to finish it and continue with the seasons throughout the next year. That's the plan at least. The yarn is so darn expensive, so we'll see how I get along.

My girlfriend, Rhea, had been acting weird. She kept checking over her shoulder whenever we were outside — crossing the street at random moments, flinching when her phone buzzed. I thought she was just stressed from work. Until last Thursday. She came over to my place late, shaking. No hug. No kiss. Just silence. I asked what was wrong, and she finally muttered, ""I think someone’s following me."" I froze. She wasn’t the type to say stuff like that lightly. She told me she’d seen the same guy three days in a row — outside her building, at the coffee shop, even on her train. Never close. Just watching. The weirdest part? He never moved. Never approached. Just stared. That night, I walked her home myself. Nothing happened. No sign of him. But when I got back to my apartment… There was a photo taped to my door. It was Rhea, taken from behind. At a bus stop. That same day. And in the corner of the photo, I could see someone else. Me. Whoever took the picture was right behind us the whole time.",3,1751799062.0,creepy,2,0.62,False

I just bought a Gaggia Classic E24, my first espresso machine, and just had a few general questions.

1. Whenever I make espresso, i notice a tiny bit of grounds still left on the thing that disperses water into the portafilter. It's a little bit hard to clean so I'm just curious if I'm just not tamping the grounds enough or if there is a recommended way to clean it.
2. What exactly is the ideal extraction time? I'm doing 5-7 sec of pre-infusion, my total time usually come around to about 25-28 seconds for 40g of espresso.
3. How can I improve overall espresso, objectively, i feel like I'm below my own bar.

FYI my workflow (using Chestnut C3 grinder, stock double shot filter) is

1 - Let machine warmup 10 min  
2 - Grind set to level 8 (very fine), 18g medium roast. (i have tried dark roast as well, too intense)  
3 - Heat up cups and portafilter  
4 - Open the valve to Pre-infuse for 5-7 seconds, start the espresso  
5 - Close the valve, espresso starts to come out, turn it off after 40g of espresso is out

what i notice is that the espresso comes out tasting a bit harsh, a bit burnt. Should i use a slighlty coarser grind? I'm also noticing a tiny bit of grounds actually make it to the espresso itself.

Also how does extraction time and grind level (which feel like the only 2 variables i can control here) relate to quality of the espresso itself?

Any additional tips appreciated! keep in mind i've brewed only 6-7 shots so far :D",1,1751798904.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

hindi ako addict sa illegal sh1ts pero marami akong bisyo na addict ako. 

Kape. Trigger ko ito sa anxiety, depshi and gerd/acidic. Tried to cut down before by not having coffee sa house, so magkakape lang ako pag nasa labas—meaning mas expensive so hindi na madalas like everyday. Unfortunately, hindi ko kinaya—pag mag grocery laging nasasama sa pagbili ang kape na ang ending may kape na sa house, almost everyday consume na. 

Cigar. Ito na yung gamot ko after atakehin ng negativity and anxiety from Kape. Chainsmoker level nako, everyday smoke—isang kaha(20 sticks) lasts me for less than 2 weeks lang. Tried to cut down ulit by using inhalers lol yung mga thai & vicks sh1t haha, di umubra kasi lagi ko na mi-misplace unlike yung kaha ng cigar. 

S3x. Weekly kong hinahanap to at nakaka 2-3 times akong seggs every week. Although no penetration naman, always oral/bj/sides lang. “Being idle is the root of evil” eh im such a homeboy na wfh always so what happens after work? Wala—dahil wala naman akong soc med, only reddit then nagkalat din naman ang porn especially soft porn sa other soc med so ayaw kong ma-trigger ang erbog ko. 

          Ibat-ibang peeps ang ka seggs ko dahil naiinvite ko lang sila sa app. Tried to uninstall and mag set ng hobbies before like running, nature trips & more friends bonding. Sadly, hindi nag work dahil hindi kami pare-pareho ng capacity w/ friends—lost motivation to run & tag-ulan narin so hindi nako ginanahan mag nature sh1ts. 



Sabi ko noon, ilalaan ko nalang yung pera ko pang pa check-up sa psych—pero may thought ako na hindi ako maiintindihan dahil sarili ko mismo hindi ko na maintindihan tapos i-eexplain ko pa sa doc. 

Napupunta lahat ng pera ko ngayon sa mga bisyong to—alak, sigarilyo, kape & s3x. Mga bisyong nakakapag-bigay sakin ng gaan ng loob sa mabigat na karamdaman. Pero, minsan nakakapag-bigay din ng bigat or at least “hollow”.

# Book 1: Prologue

You know, when I was young I had a dream to be a princess one day just like any other little girl but that all changed after my 6 birthday when my dad died.

11 years earlier

""Alessia. Alessia wake up. ALESSIA WAKE UP!""

""Mom what happened? What's going on?""

""Get some shoes on, we have to go to the hospital. Your dad was in an accident.""

""Okay""

At the hospital

We walked into the hospital and walked up to the front desk.

""Hi, I'm Mrs. Black my husband was in an accident""

""He is in surgery right now. You and your daughter can wait in the waiting area right over there and as soon as we have an update we will let you know""

Mom grabbed my arm and dragged me to the waiting area and sat in a chair shaking her leg.

About an hour later we see a doctor come out and asks for us.

""Are you Mrs. Black?""

""Yes I am. How is my husband?"" The doctor had a sad look on his face as he looked at me then back to my mom and she started crying.

""NO! YOU'RE LYING HE CAN'T BE GONE!""

""I am so sorry Mrs. Black for your loss.""

When we got home I saw mom grab a weird bottle and she went to her room and I heard the door click so I went back to bed. In the morning when I woke up I heard my mom crying in her room so I went to go check on her like she does for me when I'm sad.

\*Knock\* \*knock\* ""Mom? Are you okay? Today's My birthday, remember?"" She threw the door open and she had red puffy eyes with the bottle I saw her take into her room last night empty. ""IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!"" she screamed at me. ""What do you mean? What's my fault?"" ""IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU THEN YOUR DAD WOULD STILL HERE BUT NO! HE IS GONE AND NEVER COMING BACK BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET YOU A PRESENT TO WAKE YOU UP WITH! YOU KILLED HIM"" she screamed at me. \*SLAP\* I felt liquid and a stinging on my face then she slammed her door shut again. I ran to the bathroom crying and I looked in the mirror to see a bright red handprint and scratch marks on my face from her nails with blood coming from them. I slid down the wall crying and I asked myself ""Is this my fault? Did I kill dad?""



# Book 1: Chapter 1

Alessia's POV

""ALESSIA! WHERE IS MY BREAKFAST!"" I woke up to my mom screaming. I jump up noticing it was 6 in the morning and that I slept through my alarm and that is not good. The last time I slept through my alarm I got a black eye and broken nose.

I run out of my room not bothering to do anything to myself to get down there and try to explain why I didn't make any breakfast. ""I'm sorry mom I was up until 2:30 this morning studying for my final in History"" I tried to explain to her.

""You stupid bitch! you can't do anything right! I don't care if you were studying I still expect you to make me my breakfast"" I felt her grab my hair then throw me to the ground. She then started to punch and kick me anywhere she could. Once she was satisfied she walked away and yelled at me to clean up the blood off the floor and to make her breakfast. After I could gather enough strength I got up and cleaned the floor then made her an omelet with ham, cheese, and bell peppers.

Let me tell you about myself. My name is Alessia Black, I am 17 years old, I have blue eyes and dark brown hair, I am 5'2, my 18th birthday is in a week, and I am an underground street fighter and go by the name Warrior. You are probably wondering why I don't fight back. Well it's simple, she is still my mom. I remember when we were happy before my dad died. We were a really happy family and she wasn't always like this. So I will not hit her back. She doesn't know that I am a fighter because I sneak out at night to go to my fights and train during school time. I graduated early and she doesn't know so there is no way she wouldn't believe me.

I look at the clock and realize I only have an hour to get to training so I plate her food and put it on the table with a cup of black coffee and run up to my room and put my gym clothes in my backpack and throw on black ripped skinny jeans and a sweater and run out the door not bothering to say bye because she doesn't care. I run from my house all the way to the outskirts of town where the underground gym is. Turning the corner I bump into someone and almost fall when they catch me. I look up and I see the brightest light green eyes I have ever seen. I feel his hand trace my face while looking me over. ""Are you okay?"" he whispered to me. I didn't realize I was still staring when he asked me again.

""What do you mean?"" I ask him because I really don't understand what he is talking about.

You have a bruise on your face? Who did this to you? Are you okay?"" My eyes bug out because I didn't know that I had any visual bruises. It must have formed after I left the house. ""I need to go"" I said trying to walk away not realizing that he was still holding me. ""Can you let go of me please? I really have to go, I have somewhere I have to be.""

""At least tell me your name. Please."" It almost sounded like he was begging. I contemplated it for a minute and slowly pull away from him. As I was I looked up and noticed that there were not alone and there stood 2 other guys behind him both having shocked faces.

""My name is Alessia"" I said when I finally slipped from his grasp. I looked at him one more time before walking around him and running to the gym that was only 3 blocks away. When I got to the gym I wasn't even sweating since I have to do extreme workouts for training.

The owner of the gym and underground fighting ring, Viki Vex, is an amazing woman. Yes a female is running it. She took me under her wing when I was 12 after a really bad beating because I didn't mop the floor. She started by teaching me self defense in hopes that I would use it but she knows who is hitting me and why I don't fight back.

""Hey Alessia. Why do you put up with this? Why don't you just move out or fight back?"" she asks me. ""You know why I don't fight back and I am planning on moving out. I have been saving money from the past 3 years. I am just waiting until my birthday so she can't come after me legally"" I see a happy look come across her face. ""That's smart. Just please be safe until then. We have no idea what your mom can do until then."" She then left me to get going with my training and workout.



# Book 1: Chapter 2

Gunner's POV

After she ran away I turned around and looked at the guys and they all had shocked looks on their faces. ""What the hell is wrong with you guys? Why do you have that look on your faces?"" I saw Blade shake his head ""Dude, what is wrong you. You said please and you were nice. You are not nice and I have never heard you say please"" .

I turn around and walk towards our bikes because even I don't have an answer to why I acted the way I acted. After getting on our bikes we head to the clubhouse since we were out taking out the trash. After we get there I go straight to Tech's room. He didn't hear me enter and he was playing some video game so I decided to mess with him.

""TECH! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING?"" He Jumped out of his chair falling onto the ground. He looked up at me with a look on his face was like a kid who must got caught by their mom while their hand was in the cookie jar.

""Hey prez I didn't here you come in. Can I help you with anything?"" he asks me while getting up dusting off his clothes. ""Yeah there are some cameras I want you to hack into from about 20 minutes ago by the tattoo shop. There was a girl there and her name is Alessia. I want you to find her"" I told him. he can find anybody so I know that he can get this done. ""Yeah give me about 2 hours and I will give you her information."" He then turned around and got to work. I left his bat cave and went to my office shutting the door behind me.

I can't help but remember how she felt in my hands. Her beautiful blue eyes and how well she fit against me despite being so tiny compared to my 6'3 height. I can not wait until I can see her again. I looked at the clock and saw that it was 9 and I was tired since I didn't get any sleep the night before so I left my office locking it behind me and went to my room to lay down. The last thought on my mind before I fell asleep was how she was bruised and I was planning on finding out who did that to my queen.



# Book 1: Chapter 3

Gunner's POV

I woke up from my nap to someone banging on my door. I looked at my clock and realized in was only 12 and I was asleep for 3 hours. I ripped the door open to yell at whoever woke me up but I saw it was Tech. I still and a scowl on my face because I still wasn't happy about being woke up the way I was. I guess he saw the look on my face and a sheepish smile crept onto his face. He then pulled a manila envelope from behind his back.

""Hey prez, I found all the information I could on that girl Alessia for you. Sorry that it took a little longer than I said it would. Her full name is Alessia Ray Black, she is 17 about to be 18, she has been to the hospital for reasons unknown since she always tells a different story but it is suspected abuse, her dad died and her 6th birthday , and she is an underground street fighter by the name of Warrior. From what I can tell she is really good. I don't understand, if she is being abused why doesn't she fight back since she can fight? You know?""

""I have no idea. Thanks for getting this information for me. Don't tell anyone about this or her. Got it?"" ""Yes sir."" He then turned around and walked away after giving me her information. I go back into my room and lock the door behind me starting to look at the information on her. There are some pictures of when she was in the hospital and the markings she has, someone is definitely hitting her and I am going to find out. I get to the last page and it says that she has a fight tonight at a place nearby. Looks like you will be seeing me sooner than you probably thought my queen.



# Book 1: Chapter 4

Alessia's POV

I was in the middle of working with the punching bag when Viki came over and reminded me that I had a fight tonight at 11:30. I almost forgot about it after this morning but now I have more energy for it. I can release all of my pent up anger on them and not feel bad about it. People who fight me know are they are signing up for. ""Hey Viki, have people on stand by tonight. It's going to be a bad one."" ""Already have them called up and ready for tonight. I had a feeling after seeing you walking in here today"" she said smirking at me.

I look up at the clock and realize that it was already 2:30 and that I have been here for almost 9 hours. Time really goes by when you aren't focused on it I guess. I unwrap my hands heading to the changing rooms so I can take off my sweaty clothes, shower, and put back on the clothes that I had on when I left the house this morning. I don't want my mom to think something is up.

After I was ready I went to Viki's office. ""Hey Viki I'm heading out now. I will see you tonight."" I was about to walk back out when she called my name. ""Remember what I said. I'm always here and to be careful. If you need me you can always call me. Now go rest up. I have a feeling tonight is going to be interesting."" she smiled at me as I agreed with her and walked out.

When I was in front of my house I stopped and looked at it, not too sure if I should go in. I decide that I should go inside before she sees me out here just standing around.

As soon as I walk into the house I have to duck from a flying vase towards my head. This bitch really just threw a vase at me. It smashed against the wall and broke into little pieces everywhere. ""WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!"" She screamed at me walking over to me. I stood back up and told her I was at school. ""YOU LYING SKANK! YOU WERE PROBABLY OUT WHORING YOURSELF AROUND YOU NO GOOD BITCH!"" she was about to hit me again but I could tell that she had been drinking and doing drugs. Meth from the looks of it in the living room. She stumbled a bit and I took the opportunity and ran into my room to get away from her until she passes out. It should be soon. I made it to my room safely but I didn't want to take any chances of her coming in here and barging in since I didn't let her hit me.

I decided to lock my door and push my dresser in front of the door for a precaution. I needed to get some rest so I took off my clothes down to my bra and panties and laid down to take a nap. The day so far has drained me. As soon as my head hit my pillow I was out. Not even caring about my mom banging on my door.

I woke up at 10:45 to my alarm going off and I turn it off knowing my mom won't hear it. She was too drunk and high to wake up from it. I put on my black Nike spandex shorts and sports bra then put black ripped jeans and a black top on top of them. I put my hair in a tight high ponytail. I pushed my dresser back to where it belongs and make sure to grab my leather jack, wraps, and bike keys on my way out of my room. I make my way to the living room and I see my mom passed out on the floor with a needle in her arm still and some guy passed out next to her.

I just walked out and left her there the way she was. I have no reason to help her. Just because I don't fight back doesn't mean I have to actually take care of her when she is like this nor do I want to. I walk 2 blocks away to a storage garage where I keep my bike. Yes I have a bike, a Yamaha YZF-R1. It's black and I love her, yes it's a her, her name is Bella don't ask me why because I don't even know. I got her about a moth ago. I had enough money so I bought her brand new. I love working on her and riding her. I feel free when I do.

I pull her out of the garage and hop on. I don't have to go far tonight. I'm just going about 5 minutes away to Viki's gym where underground where she hold the fights. It's called The Underground, clich, I know.

Once I got to her gym I parked my bike in the back alley. I get off and go to the door with a blank look on my face. I can't show any weakness when I am here. The vultures eat it up and then try to bring you down. The security guy Breaker knows exactly who I am and I see a smirk appear on his face. ""Hey Warrior, from what I know you are up against a new guy. Don't go easy on him. He is way to cocky.""

""No Problem Breaker, I wasn't planning on it. It's been a long week"" I smirk back at him. He opens the door for me and I hear him chuckle as I walk inside. As soon as I enter The Underground The smell of beer, sweat, and blood hits my nose. I inwardly smile at this and walk to my personal room. I have my own room down here because I'm close to Viki and I am also the best fighter here and I have been undefeated since I started fighting at 12. I know, I'm just that good.

After I take off my clothes and I'm back in my sports bra and spandex I wrap my hands. Just as I am about to finish wrapping my hands there was a knock on the door and Viki walked in. ""Hey kid, you are up in 15 minutes. You are up against a guy who is also undefeated but he is new here, he goes by Knuckles. He is big and I haven't seen him fight so I can't tell you what his weakness is. No doubt you can find it after about 2 minutes though. You ready to do this?""

""Yeah I'm ready. got plenty of pent up anger and I heard he is too cocky. I plan on setting him straight tonight. Let's do this."" I said as I finished stretching my arms and legs. We then walked out of my changing room and went out to the fighting area that is called the pit. It was just a large space of dirt that was shaped into a circle where people stand around and watch the fight. There are different levels so everyone can see into the pit. They have a table set for betting. Tonight's fighting bet is at 12K so when I win this fight I am defiantly going to have enough money to move out at the end of the week.

I stand behind the crowd waiting for the announcer to call my name. Next thing I know Knuckles' name was being called. Everyone here knows who I am so all I hear are people booing him. I smirk looking down. ""Damn, that must of hurt his ego."" I said to Viki who starts to laugh. The crowd went quiet and I know what's coming next.

""AND NOW, WE HAVE THE AWESOME, THE AMAZING, THE BEAUTIFUL WARRIOR!!!"" The crowd goes wild jumping up and down screaming. I walk down the steps into the pit with everyone looking at me with excitement in their eyes. As soon as I am in the pit Knuckles starts laughing.

""Seriously? This is a joke right? She is just a tiny girl. There is no way that she can beat me."" He said still laughing. The crows starts chanting fight and the announcer raises his hand and the crowd goes silent. ""Fighters are you ready?"" Knuckles shakes his hand and I just nod my head yes. ""3, 2, 1 FIGHT!"" and just like that the fight began.

Every Saturday my girlfriend and her mom go out in the morning. Usually to get coffee, shop, farmers market, etc. This is something they have done for years and I love it for them, and allows me time to just chill and be at home. 

Yesterday they went out at about 8am. I was still in bed. Later on about 10am I started my day, made myself my coffee and was lounging around in the living room. My girlfriend and her mom came up and walked right into the apartment. I was naked, which we both are always naked at home. (Her mom does not know this.)  Never in 3 years has her mom come up after hanging out on a Saturday. When they came into the room I had gotten up to excuse myself and her mom came and gave me a hug. After I went to put clothes on and we chatted all for a bit. 

When her mom left, my girlfriend got extremely angry with me about what had happened and wanted to push blame on me for what had happened. I never received any calls or texts about them coming back here together. Zero notice. . This is no different than any other day or time in our apartment.Her mom didn't seem overly concerned or weird about the situation, she was actually quite normal and nothing was different.

I don't think she cared We have barely spoken since and I'm truly at a loss on what to do and how to handle this situation any further. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ",4,1751798175.0,relationships_advice,13,0.76,False

1lsxzho,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lsxzho/explore_the_stanley_classic_stayhot_french_press/,Explore the Stanley Classic Stay-Hot French Press: Is It Worth It?,"The Stanley Classic Stay-Hot French Press (Model Number 10-0288800) has been my go-to coffee maker for quite some time. Its rugged design, combined with the promise of hot coffee for hours, initially drew me in. I’m someone who thrives on perfectly brewed coffee, and I’ve put this French press through its paces in various environments—camping trips, early office mornings, and even lazy weekends at home.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this French press was its iconic Hammertone Green finish. It feels sleek yet incredibly durable. Constructed from BPA-free 18/8 stainless steel with double vacuum insulation, it screams longevity. The minimalist design is deceptively rugged and built for more than just kitchen use; it’s a coffee maker’s Swiss army knife. Its weight (about 2.5 pounds) might seem hefty, but the sturdiness adds to its charm. Even after multiple drops during a clumsy campsite breakfast, it remains untouched—a testament to its robustness.

**Ease of Use**  
Crafting a cup of coffee is impressively simple with this device. You just place your coarse-ground coffee at the bottom, pour boiling water over it, and let it brew for about five minutes. Then, a gentle press of the ergonomic plunger reveals a smooth and aromatic brew. I’ve encountered no issues with the reusable mesh filter—it’s fine enough to keep grounds at bay while allowing the coffee's richness to shine through.

[Want Stanley 10-0288800? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b07l6lqhb4/)

**Heat Retention Capabilities**  
I can safely say the heat retention is where this French press stands out. With its double-wall vacuum insulation, hot coffee stays piping hot for up to four hours, though personally, I find the optimal temperature lasts closer to three in colder camping conditions. One weekend, we brewed a pot during breakfast, then enjoyed hot refills well into lunch—no need for reheating, which is a bonus when you’re out in nature. Surprisingly, it also keeps iced coffee cold for around nine hours, which was perfect during summer outings.

**Good Points**  
- Durable stainless steel construction designed to endure rough handling  
- Excellent insulation for both hot and cold beverages  
- Dishwasher-safe for effortless cleaning  
- Reusable and efficient mesh filter  
- A larger capacity (48 oz) ideal for sharing brews  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The plunger mechanism, while effective, feels slightly stiff on the first few uses.  
- Due to its weight and size, it’s not the most travel-friendly option for ultralight packers.  
- The lack of volume measurements etched inside can lead to over- or under-filling in dim settings like campsites.  

**Alternative Products**  
Compared to competitors like the Bodum Chambord French Press or the Fellow Clara Insulated French Press, this one carves out a unique position. Both alternatives are stylish and easy to use, but the Stanley Classic boasts superior insulation and durability unmatched by most designs. Yes, the Bodum offers a sleeker aesthetic, but it falls short in heat retention, keeping coffee hot for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, the Fellow Clara dazzles with its modern edge and user-friendly coffee ratio lines but significantly jumps in price, which can be a deterrent for casual brewers.

**Price Performance**  
From a cost-efficiency perspective, this French press delivers exceptional value for its feature set. The robust build quality, unmatched thermal capabilities, and adaptability make it stand out in its price bracket. While higher-end French presses might have advanced variables like precision temperature control, they often win on aesthetics rather than practical functionality. I like knowing my investment in the Stanley Classic Stay-Hot French Press yields an affordable, reliable tool that aligns with both my outdoor adventures and office coffee cravings.

1lsxz9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/iHerbpromocode_/comments/1lsxz9b/iherb_canada_important_shipping_tariff_updates/,🇨🇦 iHerb Canada – Important Shipping & Tariff Updates!,"Hi friends from Canada!

We’ve just updated our full guide to ordering from iHerb in Canada — and there are some big changes in 2025 you should know about.

📘 Full article here:  
👉 [iHerb Canada: Shipping, Duties & Tariff Guide](https://herb-promo.com/en/iherb-canada/)

Here’s a quick summary of the most important updates, straight to the point:

# 🚚 iHerb Shipping to Canada: What Changed?

**Before:**  
✔️ You could choose from 3 shipping methods:  
– Global Air  
– Purolator (DDP)  
– DHL Express (DDP)

**Now**:  
❗️Only one shipping method is available:  
Global Air with Tracking – handled by Asendia or Landmark Global

✅ It’s still **free over CA$55**  
✅ Fully trackable  
✅ iHerb prepays all duties/taxes at checkout (DDP)

# ⏱ How Long Does iHerb Take to Ship to Canada?

**Current delivery times:**  
📦 **5–6 business days** on average with Global Air

That’s fast and reliable — we tested it ourselves recently!

# 📮 Avoid Using P.O. Boxes (Important Notice!)

⚠️ iHerb officially warns that deliveries to **P.O. Boxes may be delayed** due to **potential Canada Post strikes**.

*""We recommend avoiding P.O. Box deliveries during this time to ensure the same great value and customer experience. We apologize for any inconvenience and will resume P.O. Box services as soon as the strike ends.""*

✅ Use a regular street address for faster and smoother delivery.

# 💵 New 25% Tariffs on US Products – Are They Included?

Yes — **no need to worry about surprise customs charges!**

In March 2025, Canada introduced a **25% tariff** on certain goods imported from the US (like coffee, cosmetics, peanut butter, etc.)

Many people worry they’ll have to pay more when the package arrives — **but we checked**:

Example:  
☕ *Mount Hagen Organic Coffee*  
– U.S. Price: $11.86  
– Converted to CAD: \~CA$16.13  
– iHerb Canada Price: CA$20.46  
→ That’s about +26.8%, meaning the 25% tariff is already built into the price.

✅ You **won’t pay anything extra at the door** — it’s all handled during checkout.

# ✅ Quick Tips for Canadian iHerb Customers

* 💰 Orders under **CA$40** = no taxes
* 💡 Orders under **CA$150** = no import duties
* ⚠️ Don’t ship to **P.O. Boxes** right now due to Canada Post delays
* 🔄 All shipping is now through **Global Air with Tracking** only
* 📆 Delivery takes **5–6 business days**
