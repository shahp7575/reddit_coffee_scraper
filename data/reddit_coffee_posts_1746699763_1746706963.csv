1khop4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKfood/comments/1khop4k/hospital_food_flair_option_unrelated_no_choice/,"Hospital food (flair option unrelated, no choice but to add)","Despite numerous news articles, social media posts and regular complaints, hospital food remains simply deplorable.
Granted, a lot of patients are either too poorly to eat, or not in long enough to have regular meals, but for those of us with chronic conditions that necessitate regular hospital stays, the food is the one thing we have to look forward to. However, we are all deeply disappointed.

There are vast swathes of the population who enjoy food and cooking decent food on a budget for someone who knows how to cook, is not a challenge.
Despite this, hospitals often turn to faceless catering companies, who employ people with little to no catering knowledge, who has passed the most simple of basic food hygiene tests, and is trained in opening and closing an oven door, reheating tasteless, disgusting mass produced gunk disguised as food. The food you wouldn't feed to a dog, let alone a patient who needs nourishment. Where on earth does a cancer patients think 'I could eat that' when presented with a meal of cardboard chips, watery instant mash, frozen roast potatoes, dry, tasteless sandwiches, a wrinkly, reheated jacket potato etc?

Food is there to nourish and comfort us. Research has shown that what we put into our bodies is as vital as the medication and treatment we get. 

Patients such as myself then, who have an appetite, who have no issues with food, are deeply frustrated and upset when presented with what is likely, no better than the worst prison food.

There seems to be no calorie counting either. An adult is meant to consume on average 2,000 calories a day.

Breakfast always consists of cheap cereal and floppy toast. Nothing more. Washed down with disgusting instant coffee or stale tea.

Lunch is a disappointing selection of something that sounds good, but is always awful. And even then, the portions are tiny. For example, I ordered cod in parsley sauce with mash. What I got was minced white 'fish', tasteless white sauce, slightly speckled with parsley (barely a hint), sloppy instant mash made with water, containing lumps of powder.

For my dinner, I asked for a salad. I ended up with an omelette due to their mistake pressing the wrong button. It was a salty, reheated job. Tasted more salt than anything else.

Today, breakfast standard fayre. Lunchtime I ordered 'Jacket potato with butter and mature cheddar'.
I got a small potato, weighed about 100 grams, and a small pat of butter that doesn't cover a slice of bread, and sweaty, greasy mild white cheddar.

This epidemic of bad food is synonymous with the English palette. It's as if the people who design these menus don't even eat them themselves (as if they ever would!). It is cooked by people on minimum wage who really couldn't care less, and never interact with patients. The nursing staff are powerless to do anything, as their contractors cannot interact with them. It's a sterile situation where complaints are simply ignored and nothing ever improves. Most patients aren't in hospital long enough for any changes to ever be enacted followed up by empty promises, reasons of 'budgey contraints' etc etc. in reality, it is profiteering from people's misery and ill health. 

Something needs to be done nationwide. No gimmicks, no celebrity chefs. It needs SOMEONE who knows food, nutrition and also knows the value food has in regards to our health. A patient is far more likely to heal with proper nutrition. So often fellow patients take a few bites and give up. 'Im not very hungry' is often the reason. But in reality 'its not very nice' is the real symptom. I think a patient such as this would surely improve if there was some love given to the food. Home cooked food, tasted as it's cooked, by professional cooks. A hearty, homemade soup. A delicious crunchy fish and chips, even a simple salad.

Tonight I ordered a chicken cous cous salad. I dread to think what it will turn up to be. Last salad I had was wilted leaves, slushy tomato and transparent cucumber.

Something needs to be done. This is an important issue that desperately needs addressing countrywide.

1kholfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlignmentCharts/comments/1kholfw/how_each_main_character_from_back_to_the_future/,How each main character from Back to the Future (my favorite trilogy) would use superpowers based on their personalities,"## Marty McFly - Super Speed

**Pre-Time Travel Marty:** Would use his speed for fun and convenience - getting to school on time, escaping bullies, and perfecting his guitar solos. Initially reckless with his power, using it to show off at skateboarding tricks and impress Jennifer.

**Post-Time Travel Marty:** More confident and less impulsive, he'd be a reluctant hero. Would use his speed defensively at first but gradually take on more responsibility after Doc's guidance.

**2015 Future Marty:** Bitter and defeated, he'd misuse his speed for petty crimes or quick money schemes, having given up on his dreams and himself.

**Alignment:** Chaotic Good - rebellious but ultimately driven by good intentions.

## Doc Brown - Super Intelligence

**1955 Doc:** Initially overwhelmed by even greater intelligence, he'd create numerous gadgets without fully considering consequences. Would be excitedly documenting every discovery and insight.

**1985 Doc:** Would approach his enhanced intelligence scientifically, actively studying his own brain patterns. Would build even more ambitious inventions but with more ethical constraints than before.

**1885 Doc:** Would use his intelligence to create anachronistic inventions in the Old West while trying to maintain a low profile. His love for Clara would ground him.

**Alignment:** Chaotic Good - pursuing knowledge with good intentions but occasionally blind to consequences.

## George McFly - Time Manipulation

**1955 George:** Would barely use his powers, terrified of the responsibility. Might accidentally freeze time when frightened.

**Twin Pines George:** Would use his powers minimally, perhaps to get extra writing time or avoid confrontations.

**Lone Pine George:** Would use his abilities strategically to assist others, gaining the courage to be a proper hero. Would be drawn to help people avoid painful memories or experiences.

**Alignment:** Neutral Good - using his powers with caution and consideration for others.

## Lorraine Baines McFly - Telekinesis

**1955 Lorraine:** Would use her powers playfully, moving objects to attract attention from boys she likes or to enhance her popularity at school.

**Twin Pines Lorraine:** Would mostly use her powers for household convenience, occasionally to intervene in family arguments.

**Lone Pine Lorraine:** Confident and self-assured, she'd use her telekinesis to protect her family and perhaps even start a small business or charity.

**Hell Valley Lorraine:** Would use her powers to take down Biff, protect her children, and likely work to repair the dystopian state of Hill Valley

**Alignment:** Neutral Good - primarily concerned with family and personal well-being.

## Jennifer Parker - Elemental Abilities

**1985 Jennifer:** Practical and grounded, she'd use her powers sparingly but effectively. Would master small, useful applications like heating coffee or cooling a room.

**2015 Jennifer:** Would be overwhelmed by her powers, especially after seeing her future self. Might struggle with control during emotional moments.

**Alignment:** Lawful Good - responsible and measured in her use of power.

## Biff Tannen - Super Strength

**1955 Biff:** Would immediately abuse his strength for bullying and intimidation, becoming even more feared at school.

**Twin Pines/Lone Pine Biff:** Would use his strength for financial gain and revenge, likely becoming a feared enforcer or criminal.

**Hell Valley Biff:** Would be a terrifying combination of political power and physical strength, creating a dystopian Hill Valley through fear and corruption.

**2015 Old Biff:** Would use his strength to maintain control over people despite his age, becoming even more dangerous as he compensates for his aging body.

**Alignment:** Neutral Evil in most timelines, possibly shifting to Lawful Evil in timelines where he achieves power.",1,1746706501.0,AlignmentCharts,0,1.0,False

- Your CRM was just a Google Sheet with 40 tabs and no rules.

- People were faxing stips and still gettin’ wired same day.

- Underwriting? That was just seeing if the guy had a pulse and didn’t bounce two deposits in a row.

I (M25) met (F21) at a Cafe i frequently visited for the past 7+ years, she just started working there.

We slowly got to know eachother. We would chat while i waited for my order and talk about our lives, interests and relationships. For around 2.5-3 years we had gotten to know eachother a lot and had many common interests and hobbies.

We connected on instagram early on and would also talk on there a bunch. 
But things were aslo weird there at times.. we would talk for ages then it would randomly stop or i would be blocked then unblocked or a response would be cut short (each message would normally consist of 3-4 different topics). But when I saw her at the Cafe she would say ""I'll respond to your message after work"" which she did.

At one point around a year into our ""friendship"" I asked her if she wanted to hang-out outside of the work environment as friends (offering to go for a hike or walk at the beach maybe grab a refreshment after as that was a common interest we would always talk about) and she mentioned her bf wouldn't be comfortable with that. Which I responded that I didn't mean it in a intimate way, just to hangout as friends but I understand and respect the boundary and wouldn't ask again.

I saw her at the Cafe the next day, it was a little awkward but as I was eating my lunch she messaged me on instagram that she's sorry she shut me down, and that everything is fine, she understood i was just trying to be friendly as I'm a really nice person.

Things continued as normal after that. Even down to making me a coffee every Friday that was on the house. She would go out of her way to take my order so we could talk and also make my food/coffee instead of someone else.

She would also take a break from work to chat with me about some more personal things, like when her dog passed away etc. 

At times jokes were made in the Cafe by staff/boss/herself about me being her work husband, and things like when i walked through the door they would call out ""here comes your boyfriend"". We were like 2 peas in a pod and got along really well.

Then came the time when she was quitting her job at the Cafe. She took a break from work and we chatted for 15-20 minutes about what she will be studying at uni and where she will be working after the Cafe. I gave her a farewell gift for her last day of work (this was a normal gesture as during Christmas and birthdays the cafe and i would exchange gifts), she gave me a long hug and I said, so will we still keep in touch now i won't see you as often? And she said, for sure! She will talk to me as soon as she got home.

And that was the last I ever heard from her... and that kinda stung.. and it still hurts a bit to this day.

Every now and then I'd send a check up message but nothing.. and then i was blocked.. it's been over a year now and I still wonder what was going on so I decided to post this on reddit.
Her old co-worker reached out to me recently to inform me that she isn't with her bf anymore and that he might have been the reason for the strange interactions at times.


Did I read the situation incorrectly? 

Was it something I did? 

Has anyone else been on the opposite side to a friendship like this and can shed some light? 

I would still love to keep in touch with her and be friends as we got along really well and every chat was full of positive energy. 
Would it be wrong to try and reach out to her another way now she has blocked me over a year ago?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love you mother

But you are blinded too easily.

Why does the cub

Have to save the 

Mama Bear?

/

When stepdad was drinking

Wine bottles 

Whole,

He saw himself on the porch of a farmhouse,

Drinking freshly brewed coffee

Made with beans from 

Arabica trees.

/

When that man 

Slashed your tires,

He imagined himself in a field,

Harvesting grains and vegetables

With a light weighted and sharp sickle.

/

When he kicked our door in,

He felt as if he was in a barn,

Kicking the feed bag over

For the livestock to satisfy their hunger.

/

Maybe,

You began seeing that too.

/

You grew comfortable in that inferno.

You were ignorant of his ill-will.

You forced me to mature,

And pick the lock to the jail cell he had locked us in,

That you had the key to.

/

I refused to submit,

And let us starve and stagnate in that pit

While he was pissing on us.

So I put a target on my back.

I forced the government to give chase,

And led them to our Alcatraz.

/

Prosperity endorses those who dare.

I am a visionary,

And a first-mover.

We would have died if not for me.

Maybe physically,

But certainly spiritually.

/

I love you mother,

But that shouldn’t have been me.

You are still in a deep hole of debt,

And once again

The cub

Will have to save

His Mama Bear.

1kho8py,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1kho8py/paul_saladino_has_a_point/,Paul Saladino has a point!,"Theory: There appears to be a place for fruits in a carnivore diet, particularly papaya, mango, and banana when addressing an acute mineral imbalance.

I'm a well adapted Carnivore for several years when 10 months ago I inhaled black mold while sweeping debris from a ceiling collapse. I was fine until the next day when I had a bad night's sleep and woke feeling zombified.

I was in Europe and managed to get detox help from a pharmacy via a chelation gel. I was 50% better in a couple weeks and once back home I started a couple other protocols to help chelate remaining toxins in the system.

After including bentonite clay and charcoal for a few months I tapered off and assumed it was mostly taken care of...

Fast forward to March this year, when I'd bumped into a very stressful family event which put me into a slight anxiety attack which triggered me into unbearable heart beat felt in my chest, torso, head and virtually my entire body.

Everything pointed to minerals being depleted, and investigating cleansing from mold confirmed that a lot of minerals are sacrificed which cleansing.

Taking pills hasn't ever been my preferred method of correcting health issues but purchased and took magnesium and potassium... Potassium was only 99mg and hitting 3-4g was ridiculous number of pills so I looked for foods which could help build up the reserves.

This is when I discovered the three fruits above with excellent bioavailable mineral profile and started including a big bowl of these three ripe fresh from the tree.

After my third day of morning fruit (yesterday), the heart palpations, pounding pulse everywhere in my body and even overall body calmness finally returned to normal after enduring this discomfort for several months. Yay!!!

In the process of figuring things out, I dropped coffee from my mornings and plan to obstain from that habit to gauge if sleep improves from my 3.5 to 5 hrs nightly.

Question, would anyone recommend keeping mineral rich fruit as a morning supplement?

1kho76x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kho76x/how_does_the_ge_xwfe_refrigerator_water_filter/,How does the GE XWFE Refrigerator Water Filter perform? A detailed review,"The GE XWFE Refrigerator Water Filter is something I’ve been putting through its paces for the last few weeks, trying to determine whether it genuinely lives up to its promising description. As someone who values clean drinking water and often entertains at home, I decided to swap out my older filter for this one because it claims to tackle impurities like lead, sulfur, and even some pharmaceuticals. Turns out, this filter does quite a lot right, but there are a few quirks you might want to know about if you’re considering it.

**EASY INSTALLATION MAKES UPGRADING SIMPLE**  
One thing I immediately appreciated about this water filter is how quick and painless it was to install. No tools and no water shutoff were needed, which is a relief since refrigerators can sometimes be more complex than they look. The GE XWFE slid perfectly into place in my refrigerator (I use one of their compatible models, the GNE27JSMWW), and within minutes, I had clean water running through the system. For someone who's notorious for avoiding DIY headaches, I was thrilled with how smooth this process turned out to be.  

[Check GE XWFE Refrigerator Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0882zj48w/)

**CERTIFIED TO HANDLE EVEN THE TOUGHEST IMPURITIES**  
The water quality noticeably improved after I began using this filter. It reduced not only the usual suspects like chlorine-resistant cysts but also an impressive range of pharmaceuticals, including ibuprofen and progesterone. While I obviously can’t personally test for these substances (not that I’d want to), knowing the GE XWFE has NSF/ANSI certifications gives me peace of mind. I don’t know about you, but filtered water that can take on over 50 impurities sounds pretty top-tier to me.  

**PLUSES**  
- Certified reduction of lead and other impurities for healthier drinking water.  
- Six-month lifespan, saving the hassle of frequent swaps.  
- Compatibility with numerous GE refrigerators for seamless use.  

**OH, BUT DOES IT LAST?**  
While the product boasts a six-month lifespan with the ability to filter up to 300 gallons, I did notice a slightly reduced water flow after about five months. My household tends to use a lot of water between cooking, hydration, and coffee-making, so depending on your usage, this could mean you’ll need to replace it a bit sooner than advertised. That said, the declining flow is a nudge you can’t miss for ordering a replacement.  

**CRITIQUES**  
- Slightly high price point for what essentially is a disposable product.  
- Reduced flow rate as it approaches the end of its filtering lifespan.  

**ALTERNATIVE OFFERINGS**  
When comparing this to filters from other brands like Samsung or Whirlpool, I’ve found that the GE XWFE stands out for its pharmaceutical removal, which isn’t always a feature in other models. The Samsung models, for instance, are durable and widely compatible, but they don’t tackle the pharmaceutical impurities quite like this one does. Whirlpool’s filtration systems, on the other hand, tend to have a sturdier flow rate but may require additional adjustments upon installation. Where the GE XWFE wins is in its certified efficiency and simple installation process, but cost and longevity might tilt the scales toward its competitors depending on your household needs.  

**COST-EFFICIENCY**  
Considering its performance and features, I’d say this filter sits firmly in the “worthwhile” category, though it’s a bit of an investment. Many users, myself included, would prefer this over counterfeit or generic alternatives, especially since certified options are less likely to damage your system. This level of filtration is more expensive upfront, but it also means avoiding potential repair costs from low-quality substitutes in the long run.

The next four weeks were a blur of activity, and honestly? It felt like some weird space version of a home makeover show. Every day, more boxes arrived for the Triumph of Darron, and Emily and Zoe turned the bare-bones ship into something that actually felt like home. They didn’t disappoint, mattresses, tables, couches, desks, gym equipment, rugs, and all the little things I didn’t even know we needed until I saw them unpacked. Zoe found this ridiculously comfortable leather couch that somehow fit perfectly in the lounge, and Emily picked out curtains for the observation deck windows. Curtains. In space. I had to admit, it kind of worked.

Meanwhile, I’d been neck-deep in logistics with Dad and his team on the Genesis Platform, coordinating food supplies for the voyage. Sure, we had the small greenhouse for herbs and maybe some greens, but the bulk of our meals would come from frozen and pre-prepared rations. You can’t exactly live off basil and lettuce when you’re charting uncharted space.

By the end of it all, our quarters didn’t even look like part of a spaceship anymore. The cold steel walls and floors were mostly hidden under soft fabrics, wood paneled walls, and carpeted floors. My cabin now had a mattress that made me want to skip shifts just to lie on it. The whole ship felt... alive. Cozy. Like it was ours in every sense of the word.

As I stood in the lounge, looking at the ridiculous amount of effort we’d put into making this ship a home, I couldn’t help but grin. This was going to be so much fun. Sure, the whole thing had cost a small fortune, north of 550 million credits, and that didn’t even include the street value of the FTL drive, which could be anyone's guess, as none had been publicly sold as yet. *But who cares?* This was our dream.

Of course, none of this would’ve happened without the Interstellar Frontier Company. They’d won the Alpha Centauri survey charter from the United Earth Republic and thrown 300 million credits at us to build this ship and make the mission happen. The rest? That had come out of our savings, every credit we’d managed to scrape together. We’d spent weeks convincing Karen and Michael at IFC to back us. I mean, begging wasn’t off the table at one point.

This was their big bet on us, and if we screwed it up, the IFC would lose their investment and get their asses handed to them by the UER. No pressure, right? But if we pulled this off? We’d be rich. Like buy-your-own-space-station rich.

For now, though, I wasn’t thinking about credits or charters or all the ways this could go wrong. Standing there, surrounded by my crew, my family, it all felt worth it. Every sleepless night, every impossible negotiation, every credit we’d spent. We were ready. And as Captain, still weird, still kind of a turn-on, it was my job to make sure we didn’t screw it up.

\---

The last thing on the never-ending list was uniforms. Uniforms. Just the word made me cringe. I wasn’t exactly the “matching outfits” type, and the idea of telling my crew what to wear felt... weird. But Dad had been insistent. “It’s about discipline, Luca. Morale. Presentation. You’ll be among other crews, miners, gas scoopers, shuttle pilots. They’ll expect it.”

So here I was, dragging Emily and Zoe to a shop called Uniforms Unlimited because, let’s face it, I figured they knew more about colors and clothes than I did. My fashion sense maxed out at “does this have holes in it?” and “is it clean enough to wear again?”

When we walked in, a middle-aged woman with purple hair and a smile like she genuinely enjoyed her job greeted us. “Athan Rossi’s son, correct?” she said, extending her hand. “I’m June. A pleasure to meet you, Luca. And you must be Emily and Zoe?”

I blushed, like, actually blushed. Why do people always know I’m Athan’s kid? “Uh, yeah. Hi, June,” I managed, shaking her hand like a nervous intern. “We’re here to, uh, get some uniforms made for our crew.”

“Excellent,” she said, leading us into her office, which looked like someone had exploded a rainbow in it. Swatches of every fabric and color imaginable covered the walls and tables. It smelled like coffee and ambition, and she wasted no time pouring us cups from the fancy machine in the corner.

“So,” June began, sliding into her chair and looking at me expectantly, “what kind of look are you going for? Professional? Casual? Camouflage, perhaps?”

I hesitated, glancing at Emily and Zoe for backup. “Uh, professional but comfortable?” I said, trying to sound like I had a plan. “We’ll be spending long hours on the ship, exploring planets. Maybe a set of uniforms for onboard tasks, something for downtime... gym clothes too, maybe? Neutral colors? Grays?”

The second I finished, Emily groaned audibly and facepalmed. Literally facepalmed. “Luca,” she said, getting up and pushing me toward the door, “we’ll take care of this, okay?”

“You sure? I was thinking maybe…”

“Nope,” Zoe cut in, joining the shoving effort. “We’ve got this. You’re off uniform duty.”

June raised an eyebrow but didn’t stop them. The girls plopped back into their seats as I stumbled out the door, still holding my untouched coffee. “Fine,” I muttered, half to myself. “Just don’t make us look like space clowns or something.”

From the hallway, I could hear Zoe’s laugh echoing. “Don’t worry, Captain. We’ll make you look good.”

And there it was again, that word, Captain. It hit me like it always did, sending a warm buzz through my chest. I shook my head, trying to clear the image of Emily and Zoe in perfectly tailored uniforms out of my mind. Focus, Luca. Let them handle it.

Still, as I walked away, I couldn’t help but imagine what they’d come up with. Hopefully not something that screamed “space janitor,” but knowing those two, they’d figure out how to make us look damn good. I just hoped they didn’t spend too much on it.

\---

Five hours. Five damn hours since Emily and Zoe had kicked me out of Uniforms Unlimited, and I was still fuming. Not because I didn’t trust them, well, not entirely, but because sitting around while they ran the show left me feeling like a third wheel on my own ship.

I was in the command chair, fiddling with the bridge’s user interface, trying to figure out if I could customize the layout. It wasn’t going well. Every time I clicked something, another menu popped up, and none of it made sense. Why does everything in space have to be over-engineered?

When I heard the airlock hiss, I glanced up to see Emily and Zoe strolling in like they owned the place. Emily had this smug little grin on her face, and Zoe looked like she’d just pulled off the heist of the century.

“How’d it go?” I asked, spinning the chair around and leaning back like I was totally cool with being left out of the loop.

“It went great, Luca,” Zoe said, her smirk almost a challenge. “We’ve got some surprises for the whole crew, but you’ll have to wait and see.”

“Surprises?” I raised an eyebrow, not entirely sure if I should be excited or terrified. Knowing Zoe, it could go either way. “Shouldn’t we try them on before we leave? Did you get everyone’s measurements?” I asked, trying to sound like a responsible Captain and not like someone secretly wondering how good everyone would look in their new uniforms. Okay, mostly wondering about Emily and Zoe.

“June will transmit the design specs over tonight,” Emily said, waving off my concern. “We’ll have them before we leave. Don’t worry.”

Zoe rolled her eyes. “Relax, Captain. We’ve got it under control.”

“Fine,” I said, because I did know better than to question them when they were in mission mode. They were a force of nature, and honestly? I wasn’t about to get in their way. Instead, I turned my attention back to the bridge, letting out a slow breath as I scanned the room.

The ship was coming together, piece by piece, and it looked spectacular. The consoles gleamed under the soft light, the viewports stretched out to reveal the endless starscape, and my command chair? Perfectly positioned. This was my domain, my sanctuary, my ship.

*""Schrödinger's Cat, as a thought experiment, states that if you seal a cat in a box with something that can eventually kill it, you won't know if the cat is alive or dead until you open the box. So, until you open the box and observe the cat, the cat is simultaneously dead and alive.""*

Every morning, I drink my coffee, eat my bowl of cereal, take my medications, and stare at my phone.

On my phone is the VA app.

Once I open the app and give it my fingerprint, it will tell me whether or not my latest claim has been finalized.

But until that moment, my claim is both in process and finalized, according to quantum theory.

But which is it?  The suspense is killing me.  Did the claim complete?  Is it denied?  Did I get a new disability approved?  I don't know!  

Ah, this can't go on.  So I give my phone my fingerprint...

Sigh.  Still on step 5.

The whole place was coming down around us, rocks and lava splashing everywhere; it was a mess. The boss, a Magma Golem, was going all out while the ground was breaking apart as fire shot up in every direction. It was wild and dangerous.

This was the last fight of our long ass portal delve and it was already damned disaster, but we were still fighting. Zoe was behind me, her sniper rifle shooting up the place, striking the giant lava face with deadly accuracy. Danny, in his heavy-powered armor, was taking hits I wouldn’t survive and swinging that Warhammer of his like a barbarian. Ryan, even bleeding through his torso, was still shooting his shotgun, while I took pot shots with my rifle at the giant's head. And Emily? Panicking, as usual.

“We’re out of time!” Emily yelled while she unloaded her weapons on the boss. What a sight she was, moving like she belonged in this crazy scenario. There was something hypnotic about watching her fight, running around with her double Energy Blasters, her armor reflecting the orange of the lava around us.

Zoe sprinted across a crumbling ledge. “Then let's kill it already!”

“Let’s end this!” Danny yelled in response, again swinging his Warhammer.

I looked at Ryan. “You got one last stunt in you?”

Ryan smirked. “You kidding? I live for this shit.”

He braced himself and started running, ripping a grenade from his belt and sprinting toward the golem, straight toward the large fucker.

“Ryan!” I yelled, out of breath.

He didn’t answer me, just ran faster to the end of the ledge, and in one stupidly perfect move, he jumped off and caught the edge of the monster’s forearm, then launched himself upward. It was stupid and reckless, fucking classic Ryan Mitchell right there.

The Magma Golem's hand lashed out and caught him. A scream tore from his throat as its red-hot hand crushed through his armor and nearly tore his arm clean off. Blood and scorched flesh sizzled on the ground as he crumpled. Shit.

“RYAN!” I skidded to his side, my Scout boots just didn't have enough traction on the hot ground. I grabbed him just before the golem could finish the job. His arm was a mess, all blackened and torn to hell, so fucking gross.

Danny saw what was happening and roared, slamming his fist into his armor’s control pad, activating the Taunt ability. His aggro beacon activated as a pulse rippled out from his suit, forcing the giant's focus onto him.

“Come on, motherfucker!” Danny screamed, swining his Warhammer. “Try that shit on me!”

Its eyes snapped to Danny, its overlarge hands swinging toward him instead. I took the moment to pull Ryan back, ignoring his curses of pain. He didn't look good.

Danny somehow managed to avoid the golem's attack and swung his Warhammer, punching straight into its chest and exposing its core.

Ryan gasped through gritted teeth, trying to stay conscious. “Shit… looks bad, doesn’t it?”

""Just hold on,” I said. This wasn't the moment to get emotional.

""NOW, EMILY!”

Emily unleashed both blasters, her \[Power Surge\] ability gave each of them a 30% boost in damage. She delivered a devastating barrage of energy bolts directly into the bastard's core. The Magma Golem bellowed loudly as the energy ripped through it and it crumbled into itself. It's body started glowing and we all took shelter, fireworks time baby.

The explosion sent shockwaves through the cavern. I barely hit the ground before molten debris started raining down.

\[+0 skill XP\]

\[+18,000 credits\]

\[Mission completed! Pyroclasm Defeated, reward: 0 skill XP, 115,000 credits\]

“Woohoo, it's over,” I exhaled, sweat dripping down my face. It was hot in here, but we were done.

Emily was already grabbing a \[Quick-Clot Spray\] from her utility belt and running toward us. “Ryan, you dumbass!”

The exit portal appeared behind us, but my eyes locked onto something else. There it was, what we had been hoping for, sleek and impossibly advanced. The Vanguard Displacement Drive.

Zoe’s voice cracked in disbelief. “Holy shit.”

Ryan, despite his mangled arm, was trying to stand up to approach the thing. “We got it! We actually got the damn thing!”

The Vanguard Displacement Drive was huge and way too heavy for any of us to move, so naturally, Danny, flexing his powered armor, braced against the massive frame. “I got this, bitches.”

I exhaled, watching as he started pushing it toward the portal. This was it. This was what we had fought for.

We'd barely made it. Ryan was alive, though his left arm looked terrible, with third-degree burns and ligament damage. The squad menu in my interface had him flashing red, yet he’d live, though. Ryan was tough, a week or six in a medical pod, and he’d be right as rain. Big baby could handle it. All we needed to do was exit the portal, and our Adventuring Company's medical teams would take care of him.

And all this for what? A single FTL drive.

We were now done with Venus and its goddamn portals. Every single one was the same: boiling heat, choking air, and not even a second to take our helmets off. Absolute misery. And the IFC outpost was a goddamn sardine can: hundreds of sweaty, pissed-off people crammed into an underground bunker with no space, no privacy, and the worst bunk beds imaginable. Thank you, Karen, for your Spartan measures.

But the worst part was the wait. Venus portals were the holy grail in the Solar System, and every team wanted to get in, hoping for an FTL drive. Only one had been found so far, and ours? Ours made it two.

The queues stretched for weeks, sometimes months, to get access. If your spot came up and you weren’t there with your entire team, tough shit: back of the line. We spent half our time scrambling across the system, just making sure we didn’t miss our slot, and after thirty brutal delves and endless waiting, we finally had what we needed.

Good fucking riddance, two years to the day, since the first FTL drive had been found. And now it was ours.

I sat at the bar in my dad’s shipyard cafe, browsing through the latest auction of Europa loot drops, which had seen an uptick in 'Devastator' class weapons, and I was interested in getting a new Energy Rifle, since mine had partially melted when we met our friend the Magna Golem.

The hot chocolate in front of me was almost perfect, rich, thick, and smooth. Outside the big plate-glass portholes, all you could see was the endless dark of space. Cozy, but in that slightly rundown, “we don’t fix things until they’re broken” way.

The Vanguard Drive had changed everything for us, but now came the hard part, building the right ship that could actually use it.

The door swung open, and he came in, my old man. He saw me and made his way over, that little smirk tugging at his mouth. *Here we go again, kid.*

“Hey, Dad,” I said, trying not to sound like I was hitting him up for cash.

He slid onto the stool across from me and waved down the server for his usual double espresso. He could probably drink rocket fuel and still sleep like a baby.

We shot the shit for a bit, talked about my brothers, my team, and whatever small talk we could scrape together. It was mostly him asking about the latest portal delve, Ryan's injury, and me trying to make it sound less dangerous than it was. You know, the usual.

“So, what’s the emergency that couldn’t wait?” he asked.

I pulled out my laptop and turned it toward him.

He didn’t touch it and just looked at me for a moment. He already knew what this was, probably since the moment I asked him to meet with me. Karen must have briefed him.

“It’s about the ship,” I said.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” he asked.

“Yeah, I’m sure.”

“You could sell it, you know. Half the corporations would kill for it,"" he said. ""Hell, someone else could build the ship. Let the IFC throw some credits at it and put one of their teams in charge.”

“And wait for someone else to map out Alpha Centauri?” I asked. “No way.”

“Didn’t think so.”

I didn’t say anything; I just waited while he studied the layout. I had done an impressive job drawing out what we wanted in the ship, though Emily might disagree; *any kid can draw better than you*, she'd said.

“You planning to come back?” he asked me.

That caught me off guard. “Of course,” I said quickly. I didn't want him to think we were bailing on him, not after Mom.

He didn’t answer; he just stirred his coffee and then sipped while staring at the sketch.

After a while, he said, “Your mother would’ve told you to go; she always said the stars were waiting.” There was a hint of sadness in his voice.

""Is that so wrong?"" I asked. I needed this escape, this chance to prove myself, and maybe my team did too, we'd spent too long delving and fighting to survive in those damn portals, even after hitting the level cap, always under supervision, being the perfect team, scrounging credits and equipment. We deserved a break from the grind, a chance to see something beyond Earth and its endless politics.

“But she believed in you,” he added. “So do I, it's just... you’re asking for a lot here.”

“I’m asking for a fighting chance, Dad,"" I said.

He looked at me with his intense black eyes like he wanted to argue, like he wanted to be the voice of reason, but I’d heard it all before, before every trip out to Mars, Europa, or Venus. For a second, I thought he was going to shut it down and spiral into one of his arguments.

“You always were a stubborn little shit.”

I smiled back at him, “Takes one to know one.”

“This is a large project, and it isn’t going to be cheap,” he muttered. “Just the structure alone, the engines, building materials, furnishings? You want a goddamn lounge? Why?”

I shrugged. ""I know it’s a big undertaking, Dad. But I’ve run the math. Between our savings and the financial backing from Karen at the IFC we can make this happen.""

He raised his eyebrow. ""This is... ambitious, Luca,"" he said. *Reckless or stupidly hopeful would've been more accurate.* ""You do realize what you're asking for, right? What you want isn't just another ship, but rather a whole different class. We don't build those here, not yet. The cost alone, we're talking at least 400 or 500 million credits, just in materials. I'd need to expand my spacedock and commission a larger gantry.""

For a second, my stomach dropped. Half a billion credits?

""I know it’s a lot, Dad,"" I said, “but we'll make it back. We find something valuable out there, new resources, new technology, or rich asteroids. It'll pay for itself. And Karen believes in the mission. She greenlit the Triumph Initiative, remember?”

“She greenlit the pitch deck,” he replied.

I had nothing to say to that. We had the charter and needed a ship, a good ship.

He slid the laptop back toward me. “Alright, we’ll see what we can do.”

“Thanks, Dad.”

“Don’t thank me yet,” he muttered, his eyes still on the screen. “You’re still going to owe me after this.”

We clinked mugs. His espresso. My hot chocolate.

In the back of my mind, though, I was already having doubts. There was too much riding on this, and we were all risking so much. But I pushed them aside. We'd figure it out. We usually did, and I wasn't ready to let this go.

1kho0x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1kho0x2/almost_forever/,"Almost, Forever.","We’ve been together for six years. Our families and friends welcomed our relationship with open hearts. We’ve built something stable, something I thought was strong enough to last forever. We even started talking about the next step—building a future together. We rarely fought. If we did, it was nothing more than a small tampuhan, a misunderstanding that usually faded away in thirty minutes or less.

But then... November came, and everything changed.

One of his colleagues messaged me out of the blue. I was confused—why would she even reach out? We weren’t close, we had never even spoken. Her message shook me to the core. She said my boyfriend and this girl—her colleague—seemed a little too close. That they often looked like they had their own world. She said they shared coffee, food… little things that didn’t seem so little when I imagined him doing them with someone else. I cried. I felt my heart crumble in ways I can’t explain.

When I confronted him, he said she was just stirring drama, that the girl had issues with her own colleagues and wanted to cause trouble. I chose to believe him—because he was my boyfriend. Because that’s what love does… it trusts.

But then December came, and the truth started to unravel.

I found things. Messages. Photos. He followed her on all her social media accounts and liked her pictures and videos—something he never did with any other girl except me and his sisters. I saw photos of them close together. He lent her his jacket. They gave each other nicknames. He messaged her asking what she wanted for pasalubong. They even went jogging together—with their colleagues, yes, but still… her.

I asked him again. And he said the same thing—he didn’t have feelings for her, that she just became a close friend from work. But close friends don’t make their girlfriends feel small, or invisible.

Now, he’s trying. He’s cut her off completely. He apologizes—again and again—and I can see the effort, the change. He’s doing his best to rebuild what he broke.

But something inside me shifted.

I look at him, and I still see the man I love. But I also see the cracks. I feel the weight of everything he kept from me. He lost my trust, and though he's trying to earn it back, it's not that easy.

I still love him... but everything feels so unclear now. So uncertain. So broken.",2,1746704690.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

1kho0i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1kho0i4/31_f4a_open_to_ldr/,31 F4A - Open to LDR,"Hey! I decided to try posting here and see how things work out. I'm hoping to find a partner, or a friend. 

I'm 31 years old, a woman, and I'm from Ireland. I lived in Ireland for most of my life, but my plan is to travel and work somewhere in Europe in the next year or two. That's why I'm open to a LDR. 

My interests range from reading to language learning to exploring new places with my pup. In terms of reading, I enjoy historical fiction and fantasy, but my guilty pleasure is romance. Although I'm asexual, I adore reading romance novels. In particular, I enjoy the works by Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters, but I also enjoy silly modern romances. That being said, I'm a keen reader, so some of my other favourites include LOTR, ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time. My current read is The First Man in Rome by Colleen McCullough. 

I'm currently brushing up on my Irish-speaking skills and I'm learning German. These feed into my interest in history. I studied medieval history at university and I'm still absolutely fascinated by it all. Despite my focus on the Middle Ages, I like learning about a range of historical topics. Due to my interest in history, I love to travel and explore new places. 

Other random facts about me: I like gaming (casually, but I still really enjoy it!), drinking copious amounts of coffee, swimming, obsessing about random topics, tattoos, and rollercoasters.

As well as all that, I'm asexual biromantic. I've identified this way since I was a teenager. At this stage in my life, I'm looking for a partner who is ideally between the age of 28 - 38. I am sex-adverse, but I'm looking for a relationship that's serious and long-term.

Around 3 months ago, I moved into a house share with 2 girls (20yr olds) and I'm 25. They're already friends and were looking for a third to join their lease, as someone failed to follow through. I was told they had a cat, were clean and respectable girls, so I agreed. 

  
Fast forward to now... I'm the only one vacuuming, wiping surfaces, cleaning the bin after they stuff it and have all the rubbish/juices overflowing. In the shared bathroom, they'll leave dirty cotton pads and tissue on the floor. In the living room, they'll leave socks on the couch, heels across the floor, and empty coffee cups on counters (??). My BIGGEST pet peeve has been cardboard boxes left on the landing and them refusing to unpack them. I've asked THREE times for it to be put into rooms and not in the landing, as it takes up space and looks dirty/cluttered. Apparently they don't have time. 

On top of this, THE CAT ISN'T ALLOWED ON THE LEASE! And, on top of that, they refuse to clean the cat's litter box regularly or even take care of her. The owner is 24/7 at her boyfriend's place, and the cat is only 1 years old. This leaves an extremely anxious cat, always meowing, pooping outside of the litter tray, and keeping me up all. night. long. I can't even close my door as the cat has somehow learned how to bang on the door with its paw. I've actually received texts from my flatmates to OPEN my door as it's keeping them up! 

As well as that, they're just completely irresponsible. Will leave doors open all day, even after leaving the house. Will shout 'goodnight' to each other at 11pm, across the hall, not caring if I'm asleep. One of the girls actually left the garage door open (she's the only one with the garage key), and refused to come back until her event ended. This resulted in me cancelling my plans to make sure we didn't get robbed :) as our garage has straight access into our house and that door doesn't lock. 

Anyway, after weeks of passive aggressive texts asking them to clean and look after their cat, I reached a boiling point and blocked. So AITA for how angry all of this has made me? And if ANY of you, have any advice, please please please leave it below. 

EDIT: they made out the cat was allowed - I should’ve actually checked this before trusting them. And secondly the block was only on IG, not WhatsApp ",4,1746704606.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False
1khnzxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1khnzxp/why_choose_winsome_alex_tv_tray_set_review_for/,Why Choose Winsome Alex TV Tray Set Review for Your Home Needs?,"The Winsome 42290 Alex 2-pc Set TV Table, Natural, has quickly become a handy addition to my home. Investing in versatile, compact furniture like this makes a real difference, especially when juggling limited space. With two sturdy, foldable tables crafted from durable solid wood, this set delivers practicality with style. The natural finish blends effortlessly with various decor themes, making it visually appealing in nearly any room. Whether it’s a meal in front of the TV or a makeshift desk for my laptop, these tables have more than justified their place in my living room.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The natural finish offers a warm and elegant look, a small but lovely touch that enhances the table’s presence in any space. Weighing just 7.8 pounds each, they’re lightweight yet solid enough to hold up to 25 pounds, handling heavier laptops and dinner plates with ease. I appreciated the foldable design for quick storage, fitting snugly in the closet corner or behind furniture. Unfortunately, the absence of stain resistance had me scrambling for coasters and placemats more often than I’d like. Coffee or red wine spill? Not fun to clean off.

**User Experience**  
These tables see constant use in my home. From binge-watching Netflix with snacks (guilty pleasure!) to quick work-from-home setups on busy days, these have been quite the lifesavers. My niece even commandeered one as an impromptu arts-and-crafts table during her visit. A simple wipe with a damp cloth cleaned it up easily after she left, which the product care instructions had assured me was the go-to method.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-saving design.  
- Versatile enough for dining, gaming, or laptop work.  
- Natural finish complements a wide variety of decor styles.  

**Usability and Features**  
The hinge mechanism feels sturdy, and the overall folding action is smooth. Assembling? Well, there’s none required; they arrived ready to use straight out of the box. It's a refreshing change from other furniture purchases that come with a confusing flat-pack and an Allen wrench.

[Check Winsome 42290 Alex 2-pc Set TV Table, Natural price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b07gc42rz6/)

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Solid wood craftsmanship ensures durability.  
- Lightweight and easy to move around the house.  
- Foldable nature simplifies storage.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
The absence of stain resistance keeps me cautious while using it for meals. Also, the surface is a bit slick, so items like a vertical laptop stand or precariously balanced stack of books can occasionally slide. These aren’t deal-breakers but would make for smoother usability if improved.  

- Risk of staining without extra care.  
- Surface can feel slippery for certain objects.  

**Comparing to Market Rivals**  
In comparison to other TV tray sets like those from Linon or Lifetime, the Winsome model shines in its aesthetic appeal and lightweight build without compromising sturdiness. While my Linon table set felt heftier and less portable, it did provide added resistance to stains, making it suitable for more casual or messier use. On the other hand, Lifetime trays come with a plastic finish that I found impersonal but practical for outdoor settings. It's safe to say the Alex set balances aesthetic charm and functionality better than many competitors, although skipping stain degradation would truly elevate its game.  

**Quality for Price**  
It often feels frustrating when a product doesn’t meet expectations for its cost, but the Alex 2-pc Set balances quality and affordability quite well. You get a sturdy build, an attractive natural finish, and no need for assembly, all wrapped up in a fair price point. If stain resistance and some minor feature tweaks came along for the same value, it would be unbeatable.

1khnxzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/brighton/comments/1khnxzn/showing_friends_around_brighton_for_the_first_time/,Showing friends around Brighton for the first time,"Hi! I was born in Brighton to a Brightonian mum but I have never lived there, although I visit once or twice a year. I’ve only ever experienced Brighton from a family standpoint aside from some friends I have there that I meet for a drink and such. I’m bringing my friends to visit Brighton for the first time next week and want to show them an amazing week.  
I’ve done a lot of research but was wondering if I’m missing anything, from restaurants to bars to places to dance to things to do…. You get the gist, basically anything. For context, we are 27 years old and pretty flexible, not picky with what we like to do between nature, bars, beach, dancing, shops, mooching, and definitely food.

This is what I have planned so far:   
1st evening - dinner at Kindling   
2nd day - brunch at Oeuf, exploring Brighton (North Laines, Seven Dials, Lanes, seafront, Hove) etc.. then Helm Gallery for drinks, Voya for bites + drinks, and perhaps a night out at Green Door Store/Revenge   
3rd day - morning at Preston Park + Rockery Garden, Sunday roast, then explore Devil’s Dyke, then Permit Room for dinner   
4th day - Another exploration of Brighton, pretty open, want to try bakeries like Ikigai, LOAM etc.. and have a picnic on the beach (maybe pizza from Fatto a Mano or Cutie Pies), then Halisco for dinner   
5th day - I want to take them to Lewes for the day and Beachy Head/Seven Sisters, then Cin Cin for dinner 6th day - Brunch at Starfish & Coffee before leaving Brighton

Other places I want to go with them but might not have time include some bars like The Golden Pineapple, Bar Medusa, Cut Your Wolf Loose, etc…

Please suggest anything you think I’ve missed - all fun and notable Brighton suggestions welcome.

Thank you! 🤍",4,1746704410.0,brighton,2,0.7,False
1khnxvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1khnxvc/explore_if_the_magic_bullet_blender_delivers/,Explore if the Magic Bullet Blender delivers versatility in this detailed review!,"Magic Bullet MBR-1101 Blender, Small, Silver, 11 Piece Set has been a fascinating addition to my kitchen, offering a mix of performance, convenience, and a touch of whimsy that I wasn't expecting from such a compact device. Over the past few weeks of daily use, this blender has managed to shake up my kitchen routine—though it’s certainly not without its quirks.

**Compact Design and Versatile Uses**  
Small appliances often get overlooked in favor of their larger, more powerful counterparts. This compact countertop blender, though, embraces its smaller scale. The modest dimensions of 4.5”D x 4”W x 11.8”H make it perfect for kitchens where counter space is at a premium. I've nestled it neatly in the corner of a rather crowded counter, and it blends into the space effortlessly while still promising action. What truly sold me is how it chops, mixes, blends, and even grinds, all within a unit that's barely larger than my coffee thermos. I found myself using it for everything from protein shakes to whipping together some hummus on a whim.

**Ease of Setup and Cleaning**  
A blender that is dishwasher safe already has won half the battle in my book, and that’s a notable highlight here. The 11-piece set comes with various cups, lids, a cross-blade, and even a 10-second recipe guide. Clean-up usually involves tossing the used parts into the dishwasher, and they come out spotless, making weekday mornings much less frantic. However, those planning to hand wash might notice that certain areas of the cross-blade require a bit more attention. It's definitely not a dealbreaker but something I noticed after blending especially sticky ingredients.

[Check Magic Bullet MBR-1101 price on Amazon.](https://usegadgets.com/p/b012t634sm/)

**Strengths**  
Ever had a device perform beyond its expectations? That's how it felt here. This gadget packs a 250W high-torque power base which, though modest compared to major blenders, came through for my daily smoothie cravings and even lighter food-processing tasks. Even fibrous textures such as kale didn’t deter its stainless-steel blade. Durability, lightweight, and its BPA-free construction round out the strong points. 

- The design is lightweight and portable.  
- BPA-free materials, ensuring safety.  
- Multiple speed settings for added control.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product comes without its flaws, and there were moments when I found the Magic Bullet to be a bit frustrating. For instance, the lower 250W power means it occasionally struggled with denser ingredients—frozen bananas or larger ice cubes being some consistent stumbling blocks. Additionally, while the tall and short cups are convenient, I feel like the capacity sometimes isn’t sufficient for larger batches.

- The motor isn’t ideal for very hard or frozen items.  
- Limited capacity in the provided containers.  

**Peer Products**  
Having used other compact blenders like the NutriBullet and Ninja Fit for comparison, it’s clear this blender leans more towards versatility than brute strength. The Ninja Fit stood out for sheer power but didn’t deliver the same ease of portability or multipurpose features. Where the Magic Bullet excels is its suitability for lighter, quicker meal-making needs. Its recipe booklet introduces you to a variety of uses, making it an excellent stepping stone if you're new to kitchen blenders. However, more power-hungry users might benefit from NutriBullet alternatives.

**True Value**  
Given how much use I’ve squeezed out of it in just a month, I’d argue the price-performance ratio is favorable for lighter blending tasks. You’re not buying this for professional-level cooking, but for casual cooks or even student households, it’s an absolute win. The detachable party mug was a bonus as it doubled as both a blender cup and a tumbler for sipping straight away.

(Here is the Part 2 ng [Nalaman ko na ako pala ang ""the one that got away"" ng campus crush namin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MayConfessionAko/comments/1kg43n0/comment/mr2fg0f/)) 

Kinabukasan, nakita ko ‘yung IG story niya — picture ng table namin, may caption:  
**Like lang muna ako. Tamang paramdam.**

Hindi ako nag-chat. Pero sa totoo lang, gusto ko mag-hello.  
Pero pinili ko na wag.

After that, chill lang. Silent viewers lang kami sa stories ng isa’t isa.  
Parang dalawang taong may sinimulan, pero walang lakas ng loob magpatuloy.

Then out of nowhere, three months later — nag-message siya.  
**“Nasa Ortigas ako. G ka for coffee?”**

Wait.  
**Ortigas?**

Doon ako nagta-trabaho that time.  
Pero… sa pagkakatanda ko, hindi ko ‘yun nasabi sa kanya.  
Wala akong post about it. Never ko na-share.

Nag-reply pa rin ako.  
**“Saan ka banda?”**

She replied.  
**“Podium.”**

Sakto. Nasa Megamall ako nito. Konting lakad lang.  
Di ko na tinanong kung anong alam niya tungkol sa trabaho ko —  
baka sinadya, baka nagkataon.

Either way, nagkita kami sa UCC.

We sat across from each other. Like two people pretending this was just coffee,  
pero alam naming pareho, hindi lang ‘yon.

And there she was — wearing a very loose white polo, black skimpy shorts,  
and that kind of calm, confident look that f\*cks you up without trying.

And the look in her eyes that makes me feel like I’m 17 again —  
confused, hopeful, and completely defenseless.

And here I am, still looking like some clueless college kid —  
black hoodie, oversized black glasses, and my favorite Air Max,  
trying to look fit (I’m definitely not).

At that moment, I knew:  
**I f\*cked up.**

Not because of anything I did that day,  
but because I knew deep down…  
**I can’t move on from this if I fall this deep.**

And seeing her again like that — looking both familiar and completely out of reach —  
just made everything hurt,  
like a wave crashing over me.

Biglaan. Walang babala. Walang salbabida.

We talked — usual catch-ups, kwento sa buhay.

Then I looked at her, smirked, and said:  
**“Uy, namiss kita kamo.”**

She raised an eyebrow, half-smiling.  
**“Ano pa namiss mo?”**

Put\*ngina.  
That hit harder than I expected.

I looked at her, trying not to let it show.  
But my chest was doing that stupid thing again —  
‘yung parang may kumakalikot sa loob, na hindi mo alam kung excitement ba ‘to o warning sign na naman.

Gusto ko sanang sagutin ng diretso:

**“Ikaw. Lahat ng ikaw.”**  
  
Yung tawa niya, yung kulit niya,  
Yung tahimik na presensya niya pag wala nang masabi,  
Yung paraan ng pagtitig niya na parang sinisilip kung anong tinatago mo.  
Yung malambot niyang mga kamay.  
Yung mga ngipin niyang laging kumakagat sa’kin kapag nanggigigil siya.  
Yung smell ng pabango niya na hanggang ngayon, kahit hindi ko alam brand,  
alam ko agad pag naamoy ko sa iba.  
At ‘yung halik niya nung reunion.

Pero hindi ko sinabi lahat ‘yon.

So I just smiled and said,  
**“Secret. Hehe!”**

Tumawa siya.  
Yung tawa na hindi malakas, pero ramdam mong totoo.

And just when I thought maybe — just maybe — this moment could stretch a little longer,  
dumating ang friend niya na girl.

Now I feel awkward.

Then she said,  
**“Samahan mo kami, ha?”**

I managed a nod.  
**“Oo naman.”**

So her friend sat with us. Ordered a drink. Laughed. Chimed in.  
And suddenly, we were three.

But I swear, it still felt like it was only her I was hearing.

I kept stealing glances —  
catching her fingers fidget with the straw,  
the way she bit her lip while listening,  
the way she never quite looked me in the eyes anymore.

And I wondered if she felt it too —  
the invisible glass wall now between us.

Her friend talked and talked, and I nodded where I should, smiled where I had to.  
Pero sa loob-loob ko, parang unti-unti akong lumulubog sa kawalan.

**Hindi ako part nitong buhay na ‘to.**

Then her phone buzzed.  
She checked the screen. Her eyes widened just a little. Then she stood.

**“Wait lang, I need to take this,”** she said, already heading out.

And just like that, she was gone again.

Left me sitting across a girl I didn't even know,  
in a coffee shop that suddenly felt too quiet despite the noise.

I reached for my drink, trying to distract myself.

Then the girl leaned in, smiled — that kind of smile that feels both curious and knowing — and asked:  
**“Are you... Breeze?”**

I muttered,  
**“Yeah, I think,”** with an awkward smile.

I looked at her friend again.  
That loaded smile.

And in that moment, I knew.

She talked about me.

Maybe too much.  
Maybe not enough.  
Maybe I was still a story she tells…  
with edits, with filters, with caution.  
Maybe I was still a question mark in a sentence she never finished.

She came back a few minutes later — calm, composed, like nothing just shifted.  
But I saw it. That subtle change in her energy.

Her friend stood up, then said,  
**“Tara na?”**

She glanced at me.  
**“Sige.”**

Tumayo na rin ako.  
**“Ingat kayo.”**

Tumango lang siya, walang salita, then they walked away.  
Sumakay na sila ng Grab. (Maygrab pa nitong time na to

Sobrang traffic.  
Ang daming ilaw.  
Ang bagal ng gabi.

Simple lang lahat.  
Walang yakap.  
Walang lingering goodbye.  
Walang **“see you soon.”**

Paglabas ko ng Podium, umambon na.  
Ang ingay ng paligid — busina, mga tao, sasakyan — ang bigat ng hangin.  
Parang may binubulong na hindi ko maintindihan.

Hinintay kong makaalis ‘yung Grab nila bago ako maglaho sa kawalan.

Tumunog ang phone ko.

**Message from her.**  
**😘**

Put\*ngina.

Nakatitig siya sa’kin.  
Hindi ngumiti.  
Hindi kumurap.

At sa mga mata niya, naramdaman ko ‘yung unti-unting pagkalunod.

She wasn’t just looking at me —  
**she was reclaiming me.**

Bit by bit.  
Slow. Deliberate.

Parang gusto niyang malunod ulit ako.  
Sa orbit niya.  
Sa katahimikan niya.  
Sa lahat ng iniwan niyang gumugulo pa rin sa’kin hanggang ngayon.

**Yung titig niya?**  
Hindi lang basta naaalala.  
**Sumasakal.**

Ginagapang ka mula loob.  
Tahimik.  
Mabagal.  
Walang awa.

1khnxeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1khnxeu/why_choose_the_dogtra_handsfree_square_collar/,Why Choose the Dogtra Handsfree Square Collar Review for Effective Dog Training?,"The **Dogtra 644622020840 HANDSFREE Square Expandable Remote Dog Training Device** has been a game-changer in my everyday interactions with my adventurous and, let's be honest, stubborn canine companion. After spending weeks testing this product, it felt like a small revolution in dog training. While there are plenty of upsides to this device, no product is without a few quirks to consider. Let’s break down every aspect.

**Brilliant Design for Multitasking**

During walks and training sessions, the compact and lightweight build of the unit really stood out. Weighing just 0.32 ounces and measuring 2.25 x 0.75 x 0.04 inches, this tiny gizmo doesn't feel like a burden. I strapped the HANDSFREE Square to my wrist, much like a watch, and it stayed in place firmly thanks to its intuitive and flexible buckle design. One of its more unique features is the ability to wear it around your palm or even on your finger, making it shockingly discreet. Whether you're holding a leash, juggling groceries, or multitasking with coffee in one hand, this keeps you in control without missing a beat.  

[Grab Dogtra 644622020840 at the best price on Amazon.](https://petof.com/p/b09dp18tkc/)

**Incredible Range for Practical Applications**

The range on this device is another feature that cannot go unnoticed. With the ability to operate functions like Nick, Constant, or Pager from up to 3/4 of a mile away (that's impressive!), it allowed me to easily manage my dog, even when he strayed a bit too far. While there is a requirement to be within 33 feet of the paired transmitter, this wasn’t a problem in my daily use. Whether you’re out in a large park or in your backyard, this feature ensures your training control extends as far as your dog’s curiosity!  

**Upsides**

- Option to pair multiple HANDSFREE Squares (up to 14 per transmitter).  
- Flexibility to fasten it on the wrist, palm, or fingers.  
- Long battery runtime—lasts 7–10 years with typical use.  
- Super lightweight and compact.   
- 3/4-mile remote access is great for large spaces.  

**Pitfalls**

- Needs to remain within 33 feet of the transmitter for functionality.  
- Not waterproof, so it’s unsuitable for heavy rain or trips to the beach.  
- Compatibility limitations with older HANDSFREE systems, where only one Square can pair per transmitter.  
- Requires users to purchase a HANDSFREE Series system to operate. 

**How It Fits into Daily Training**

Pairing this with my dog-training regime was seamless. The product is expandable, which means households managing multiple dogs will likely benefit. I haven’t reached the 14-Square limit yet, but programming multiple devices to one transmitter was really handy. A simple button press activated key training modes, like the gentle Pager vibration that was a much-needed nudge for my easily distracted dog. Since it’s lightweight, I could carry on my training tasks without fumbling.

**Battery Life: Practical and Reliable**

Powered by a lithium coin battery, this product doesn’t demand high maintenance. I wasn’t too thrilled about needing a replacement battery after so many years, but its 7–10 year lifespan is generous enough. Even heavier users—like trainers working with multiple dogs each day—should find the durability of the battery suitable for long-term use. However, a notable downside is the lack of waterproofing. For owners with water-loving breeds, this could be a limitation. Beach or rain enthusiasts may find this point less appealing.

**Market Rivals**

I’ve seen other electronic training collars aimed at offering similar conveniences. For instance, brands like Garmin and Halo offer their own versions of high-tech training equipment. While some may offer waterproof models or exaggerated range promises, this device excels in its focus on simplicity and functionality. Where others try to overreach with GPS or app integrations, it sticks to practical solutions like discreet controls and easy multitasking options. That focus is perfect for people like me looking for a no-fuss experience. However, for professionals needing more robust waterproofing or hyped extras, alternatives might deliver more.

**Quality for Price**

After spending ample time experiencing this training solution hands-on, I’d say its price correlates well with the unique functionality provided. You don’t feel like you’re overpaying for unnecessary add-ons, as it merges utility and convenience into a single well-thought-out package. Its value becomes especially clear when considering how much simpler it can make various dog-training scenarios. Other pricier models might offer extras like app syncing, but these could complicate something otherwise straightforward.

1khnt43,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1khnt43/does_the_bunn_csb2b_coffee_maker_review_prove_its/,Does the BUNN CSB2B Coffee Maker Review Prove It's the Fastest Brewer?,"Brewed perfection is something I obsess over. With the BUNN 52700.0002 CSB2B and its claim of being the ""Fastest Home Coffee Maker in America,"" I had to see if it could dethrone my trusty old French press. Spoiler alert: this coffee maker might just have earned its permanent spot on my counter, though not without its quirks.

**Impeccable Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that hit me upon unboxing this machine was its robust and sleek appearance. The matte black finish paired with high-polished stainless-steel accents made it feel more like an appliance from a café than a standard kitchen tool. It seamlessly complimented my other kitchen gadgets. Compact for what it offers (7.7""D x 12.7""W x 13.8""H), it didn’t take up obnoxious space on my counter. Plus, it’s designed and assembled in the U.S., which I know some folks will appreciate.

The build instills confidence. The tank, constructed with commercial-grade stainless steel, feels like it could survive an apocalypse. And the product also includes thoughtful additions like the drip-free carafe—finally, no more coffee stains on my white counters! That innovative spout actually arcs any leftover coffee neatly back into the carafe. Little design details like this often become the unsung heroes of daily usability. 

**Brewing Experience Like No Other**  
I’ve never owned a coffee maker with a commercial-style multi-stream spray head before, and consequently, I had high hopes for the flavor. And wow—it delivered. The multi-stream spray head showers hot water consistently across the coffee grounds, ensuring maximum extraction and robust flavor. Using this machine honestly felt like having a café in my own kitchen, though minus the grumpy barista yelling my name wrong.  

Pour the water, flip the lid, and four minutes later, you’ve got 10 cups of piping hot coffee—a speed no joke. Most coffee makers take twice as long to deliver the same volume, so this feature stands out. However, there’s a catch: the coffee maker does not have an automatic shut-off system, meaning you need to manually turn off the warming plate or risk forgetting it altogether. It’s a minor inconvenience, but one worth considering.

**Energy Efficiency and Warm Coffee Anytime**  
This coffee maker keeps 70 ounces of water always hot (thanks to its internal stainless-steel tank). Think of it as “on-demand brewing.” While this adds convenience, especially during rushed mornings, you might need to brace yourself for a slightly higher energy bill. For someone who downs cup after cup daily though, it’s an acceptable tradeoff.  

The warmer plate (manually operated by a switch) is also fantastic, keeping coffee at optimal drinking temperature for longer. It's handy if you're someone like me who takes too long sipping coffee while scrolling aimlessly on social media.

[Check BUNN 52700.0002 CSB2B price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0792t7rw1/)

**Upsides**  
- Brews a full 10-cup pot in just four minutes.  
- Drip-free carafe that avoids countertop messes.  
- Durable, professional-grade materials.  
- Café-style brewing technique enhances flavor extraction.  

**Caveats**  
- Lack of automatic shut-off can be a headache.  
- Always-on water heating may spike energy bills.  
- Initial setup takes a bit of learning due to unique design.  

**Competing Coffee Makers**  
Standing this machine side-by-side with competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or Keurig K-Elite, the differences became apparent. The Cuisinart and Keurig might offer programmable settings or pod convenience, but neither comes close to the BUNN coffee maker's speed or flavor depth. For instance, I found the Keurig's coffee lacking the richness produced by the commercial-style spray head of this unit. Similarly, the Cuisinart brews slower and often requires more maintenance.

That said, both competitors do include auto-shutoff features, one area where the BUNN coffee maker feels dated in comparison. Think of this machine as the ""manual transmission sports car"" of coffee makers: fast and effective for those who want the thrill, but requiring a little extra hands-on care that some might not prefer.

**Affordable Quality**  
Though I can’t pinpoint the exact price here, I’ll say this: you’re getting considerable bang for your buck. This isn’t a coffee maker packed with unnecessary bells and whistles; instead, it’s laser-focused on delivering café-quality coffee at record speed. For those tired of waiting around for their morning caffeine fix, the features seem well worth the investment. It’s not the cheapest machine, but it strikes the perfect balance between performance, durability, and style.

SO u/whoresmith befriended me on Reddit. We have been friends for more than 2 months and we decided to meet.

So, we decided to meet and be awkward in person, for a change. 

Y'all he was late (pmo) on the first meet (like 5 minutes late)!  
We saw each other and walked past cause we got so awkward, lmao. But then we just shook hands and decided to go for a walk and plan what to do. We got coffee, then went for dinner, and yapped so much. (we kept questioning whether it's a date or just two friends catching up, lol.)

I like to get silly little gifts for my friends whenever we meet and mostly I get flowers - but he is allergic to flowers (pollen allergy). So I had to cook up something else. I decided to make paper flowers and gift him those. I also got him an Arctic Monkeys' album Spotify thingy (he loves them), with a note on the back. A souvenir to remember me by. He got teary eyed and appreciated it a lot :3

It was a whole bunch of bullying each other, making jokes, and catching up. Just playful conversations where you think 'we should've been friends since childhood'.

Ahahhah, we met again after this and he got me chocolates cause I was on my periods and in a really pissy mood (and he coincidentally got me my fave chocolates). Good stuff!

Whether you’re drawn to natural textures or contemporary finishes, integrating versatile elements like rattan side tables, concrete side tables, and statement furniture is key to achieving a balanced interior.

**1. The Beauty of Rattan: A Natural Touch for Every Room**

As someone who considers coffee an essential part of life, I’ve truly put this product through its paces. With its compact design, programmable buttons, and quick brewing capability, this espresso machine has a lot to offer, but, as with all things, there are aspects to weigh carefully.

**Compact Design for Any Space**  
Living in a cozy apartment with limited counter space, finding appliances that don’t dominate my kitchen is crucial. The compact and lightweight build of this machine—measuring just 4.72"" in depth—ensured it fit snugly next to my toaster. Its minimalist matte black finish added a sleek, modern touch to the kitchen. While its construction feels sturdy for daily use, the lightweight nature might make it feel slightly fragile when compared to heavier, more premium machines.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Getting that first cup of coffee doesn’t require an engineering degree with this one. The intuitive buttons for customizable Espresso and Lungo sizes made brewing a breeze. Programming the desired coffee quantity required only a few presses, and voila—my favorite brew was just a touch away. Even my tech-challenged aunt visiting over the holidays could use it effortlessly.  

[Check Delonghi Inissia Nespresso Black EN80B price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00g5yovza/)  

**Rapid Heating and Efficiency**  
Mornings can be hectic, but that 25-second heat-up time changed the game for me. Gone were the days of waiting an eternity for coffee while juggling other tasks. Its 24-ounce tank capacity was sufficient to brew up to nine coffees before needing a refill, which easily lasted me and my caffeine-loving roommate a couple of days. However, I did notice that positioning a larger mug could be a tight fit—even with the folding drip tray.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight and compact size ideal for small kitchens.  
- Rapid heating gets your coffee ready in 25 seconds.  
- Customizable espresso and lungo options for tailored brewing.

**Energy-Saving Mode and Sustainability**  
With energy costs being a concern, the automatic shutoff after nine minutes of inactivity became an appreciated feature. Knowing the machine looked out for efficiency eased a bit of guilt about using an electric espresso maker every morning. However, I couldn’t help but wish that an extra five to ten minutes on the timer was possible, particularly during weekends when I tended to make multiple cups leisurely.  

**High-Pressure Pump for Barista-Level Coffee**  
I’ve used several espresso makers in the past, but the 19-bar pressure of this one stood out. Every cup was packed with rich flavor and that smooth crema one would expect from expensive coffee shop brews. My brother, who’s a coffee snob of the highest order, was thoroughly impressed the day he visited. He even asked if I had quietly spent thousands on a high-end machine!  

**Caveats**  
- Larger mugs can be tricky to fit securely.  
- The lightweight design might feel less durable compared to metal-bodied machines.  

**Other Options to Consider**  
Comparing this espresso machine with alternatives, I’ve tested the Vertuo system from Nespresso. While the Vertuo offers a broader variety of drink sizes and a smoother pod-loading mechanism, the cost of the pods is significantly higher than the OriginalLine capsules compatible with this unit. For a budget-conscious coffee lover like myself, that adds up quickly over time. Traditional manual espresso machines, like the Breville Bambino, deliver more control during the brewing process, but they demand a higher level of effort (and cleaning) that’s hard to match during rushed mornings.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This product balances affordability and quality quite masterfully. With features like programmable buttons and an energy-saving mode, it’s difficult to complain about value. The fact that capsules are affordable and widely available makes it a more sustainable choice compared to pricier coffee systems. While there’s some room for improvement in durability and compatibility with larger cups, the machine delivers great coffee without a premium price tag.

One of the longtime residents is Mr. Jenkins — he’s in his early 70s, retired, and probably the most consistent person I’ve ever met.

Every morning, without fail, I see him walking down our block at exactly 7:15 a.m. He wears the same wide-brimmed hat, carries a reusable water bottle, and nods at every neighbor he passes. Rain or shine, even when it snowed once last year (a rare event here), he was out there.

**The Day I Finally Asked Him Why**

A few weeks ago, I was taking out the trash and caught him mid-walk. I asked if walking every day was just for health or if there was more to it.

He smiled and said, “I do it because it's one thing I can control, and it keeps my head clear. Routine makes space for peace.”

**That stuck with me more than I expected.**

**What I Took From That**

I started doing something similar — not walking necessarily, but waking up 30 minutes earlier just to stretch, make coffee slowly, and actually sit down to plan my day.

It’s not perfect. Sometimes I sleep in, sometimes I forget. But more often than not, I’ve noticed my days go smoother when I start with structure instead of just diving into chaos.

**The Bigger Lesson**

Mr. Jenkins never gave me a lecture. He didn’t recommend a book or app. He just lived his routine with quiet intention — and that said more than any “productivity tip” I’ve seen online.

Picture this: a marketing department that works tirelessly, 24/7, without needing coffee breaks or paychecks. A team that can write blog posts, design eye-catching visuals, produce short videos, and manage its own workflows, all with minimal input from you. Sounds like something from a science fiction movie, right? Well, what if I told you this isn't a far-off dream but something you can set up right now, even if you don't know a single line of code? 

Thanks to the amazing advancements in artificial intelligence and user-friendly automation tools, building such a ""team"" is now within reach for almost anyone. This isn't about replacing human creativity; it's about augmenting it, taking the repetitive tasks off your plate so you can focus on the bigger picture.

In this guide, we'll explore how a single AI agent, when cleverly combined with no-code platforms, can perform many functions of a traditional marketing department. We're talking about a setup that can streamline your content creation, automate video production, and bring a new level of efficiency to your marketing efforts. This approach can be a real blessing for startups trying to make a mark, small businesses aiming to grow, or even larger companies looking to make their resources go further. Get ready to see how you can use the smarts of AI to give your marketing a serious boost, without the usual headaches or hefty price tags. Sometimes, the most capable assistant isn't a person, but a well-orchestrated set of algorithms.

# The Future of Marketing is Here: Your One-Agent Team

The world of marketing is always moving fast. Staying ahead means being adaptable and resourceful. For many, especially smaller operations or solo entrepreneurs, the idea of a full-fledged marketing team is a distant wish. But what if the ""team"" could be largely automated, driven by intelligent systems?

# Ever Wished for a Marketing Superhero?

Many business owners and marketers find themselves juggling countless tasks. One moment you're a writer, the next a graphic designer, then a social media manager, and perhaps a video editor by the afternoon. It's a lot to handle, and it can feel like you need superhuman abilities to keep all the balls in the air. This is where the concept of an AI-driven marketing agent comes in – not as a mythical hero, but as a practical helper.

Imagine having a system that can draft a blog post based on your ideas, suggest visuals to go with it, and even schedule it for publishing. This isn't about replacing your unique insights or strategic thinking. Instead, it's about providing a powerful assistant that handles the groundwork, the repetitive elements, allowing your creative energies to be channeled more effectively. For businesses watching their budgets, this approach offers a way to achieve professional marketing outcomes without the expense of hiring for multiple specialized roles from day one.

# What Exactly is This AI Marketing Whizz?

When we talk about an ""AI agent"" in this setup, we're not referring to a robot sitting at a desk. Think of it more like a smart coordinator or a conductor of an orchestra. This AI agent is essentially a sophisticated workflow that connects different specialized AI tools and software services. It receives your instructions (perhaps a simple text command) and then directs various applications to perform specific tasks – one tool might write text, another might generate an image, and a third might compile these into a video.

The AI agent itself doesn't ""think"" or have ""ideas"" in the human sense. It operates based on the instructions it's given and the capabilities of the tools it's connected to. It’s the central hub that makes all these separate pieces work together in harmony to achieve a marketing goal. It’s the intelligence of the system you build.

# Why Go Code-Free? The Beauty of No-Code Automation

One of the most exciting parts of this AI marketing revolution is that you don't need to be a coding guru to make it happen. ""No-code"" platforms have emerged as a genuine enabler for people who have great ideas but not necessarily the technical programming skills to build complex software from scratch.

Platforms like n8n (which we'll talk more about) use visual interfaces. You can often drag and drop different app ""nodes"" and connect them to create a sequence of actions – a workflow. For instance, you might connect a node for ""receive a command via Telegram"" to a node for ""ask OpenAI to write a blog post,"" then to ""save the post in Google Drive,"" and finally to ""send a notification."" This visual way of building automated processes opens up powerful capabilities to a much wider audience. It means you can focus on the what (your marketing strategy) rather than getting bogged down in the how (the intricate code).

# Meet Your New AI Marketing Colleague: Capabilities Unpacked

So, what can this AI-powered marketing assistant actually do? You might be surprised by the range of tasks it can handle. By integrating various best-in-class AI tools, your central agent can orchestrate a variety of marketing functions.

# The Wordsmith: Crafting Compelling Content

Written content is the backbone of so much marketing. From blog articles that draw in readers to snappy social media updates and persuasive email campaigns, words matter. Your AI agent can be a huge help here.

* **Blog Post Generation:** Provide a topic, a few key points, or an outline, and the AI can draft an entire article. You can then review, edit, and add your personal touch. This can dramatically speed up the process of filling your content calendar.
* **Social Media Copy:** Need a catchy tweet, an engaging Facebook post, or a descriptive Instagram caption? The AI can generate multiple options for you to choose from, tailored to the platform and your audience.
* **Email Marketing Snippets:** From subject lines to body copy for newsletters or promotional emails, AI can help you craft messages that get opened and read.

The key is to provide clear prompts and guidance. The AI learns from vast amounts of text data, so it can adapt its style and tone to match your brand's voice, whether you want it to be formal, casual, witty, or informative.

# The Visual Virtuoso: Designing Stunning Graphics

A picture is worth a thousand words, especially in marketing. Your AI agent can help create and modify visuals without you needing to be a Photoshop expert.

* **AI Image Generation:** Using tools like OpenAI's DALL-E or similar models, you can describe an image you want, and the AI will create it from scratch. Want a ""futuristic cityscape at sunset for a tech blog banner""? Or ""a friendly robot mascot holding a welcome sign""? The AI can generate these.
* **Image Editing:** Need to make quick changes to existing images? The AI can assist with tasks like adjusting colors, adding text overlays, cropping, or even more complex modifications if integrated with the right image processing APIs. This is great for creating variations of an image for different platforms or A/B testing.

This capability means you can have fresh, relevant visuals for your content much faster than traditional design processes might allow, especially for everyday needs like social media posts or blog illustrations.

# The Video Visionary: Producing Engaging Short Videos

Video is king on many platforms, but production can be time-consuming and costly. Your AI agent can help automate parts of this process, especially for shorter, ""faceless"" videos (videos that don't feature a person on camera).

* **Combining Elements:** The system can take AI-generated visuals (or stock images/clips), add AI-generated voiceovers or background music, and use video rendering tools to piece them together into a cohesive video.
* **Templated Videos:** Using platforms like Creatomate, you can set up video templates. The AI agent can then populate these templates with new text, images, or clips to quickly generate multiple video variations for ads, social media stories, or product showcases.

While it might not replace a high-end film crew for a major brand campaign, it’s incredibly useful for creating a steady stream of video content for social media or informational purposes.

# The Digital Detective: Smart Image Searching

Sometimes, you already have a library of images, or you need to find a specific type of image for a project. An AI-integrated system can help here too.

* **Database Search:** If you have a collection of images, the AI can help you locate specific ones based on content, tags, or even visual similarity. This is much faster than manually sifting through folders.
* **Image Identification:** In some setups, the AI might be able to identify objects or themes within an image, making it easier to categorize or decide if it's suitable for a particular use.

This streamlines the creative process by making your existing visual assets more accessible and usable.

# Your Personal Assistant: Always Ready for Your Command

One of the neatest aspects is how you can interact with this AI marketing system. Instead of complex dashboards (though those exist for setup), you can often use simple interfaces.

* **Chat-Based Commands:** Platforms like Telegram are popular for this. You can send a text message to your AI agent, like ""Create a blog post about the benefits of remote work,"" or ""Generate an image of a cat wearing a party hat.""
* **Voice Commands:** Some setups might even allow for voice commands, making it even more intuitive to kick off a marketing task while you're on the go.

This ease of use means you don't need to be at your computer or have deep technical knowledge to get things done. Your marketing assistant is just a message away.

# Setting Up Your AI Marketing Powerhouse: The n8n Workflow

The magic that ties all these AI tools together into a functioning ""marketing team"" is often an automation platform. One popular and powerful choice, especially for those who prefer a visual, no-code approach, is n8n.

# What's an n8n Workflow, Anyway?

Think of n8n as a digital switchboard operator or a conductor for your software orchestra. It allows you to connect different applications and services (like OpenAI, Google Sheets, Telegram, etc.) and define a sequence of actions for them to perform automatically. This sequence is called a ""workflow"" or a ""scenario.""

Instead of writing code, you work with a visual interface. Each application or function is represented as a ""node."" You drag these nodes onto a canvas and connect them in the order you want things to happen. For example, a ""When I receive a message on Telegram"" node could be connected to an ""Ask OpenAI to generate text"" node, which then connects to a ""Save text to a Google Doc"" node. It’s a logical, visual way to build quite complex automations without needing to be a programmer.

# The Blueprint: How These AI Workflows Operate

Within your n8n setup, you'll design various workflows, each tailored to a specific marketing objective. These workflows are the ""brains"" behind your AI agent, dictating how tasks are executed from start to finish. Here are a few examples of how these might be structured:

* **Workflow for Creating Fresh Images:**
   1. **Trigger:** You send a command via Telegram (e.g., ""Create image: a serene beach at sunrise"").
   2. **Action 1 (n8n):** Receives the command and extracts the image description.
   3. **Action 2 (OpenAI node):** Sends the description to an AI image generation model (like DALL-E).
   4. **Action 3 (OpenAI node):** Receives the generated image back.
   5. **Action 4 (Google Drive node):** Saves the image to a designated folder in Google Drive.
   6. **Action 5 (Telegram node):** Sends you a message back with the image or a link to it.
* **Workflow for Sprucing Up Existing Visuals:**
   1. **Trigger:** Command via Telegram (e.g., ""Edit image \[image ID or link\]: add text 'Summer Sale!'"").
   2. **Action 1 (n8n):** Retrieves the specified image (perhaps from Google Drive or another source).
   3. **Action 2 (Image Editing API node, e.g., PI API):** Applies the requested changes (like adding text, adjusting colors).
   4. **Action 3 (Google Drive node):** Saves the edited image.
   5. **Action 4 (Telegram node):** Notifies you or sends the edited image.
* **Workflow for Generating Written Gold (like a Blog Post):**
   1. **Trigger:** Command via Telegram (e.g., ""Write blog post: 'Top 5 Tips for Healthy Eating'"").
   2. **Action 1 (n8n):** Extracts the topic.
   3. **Action 2 (OpenAI node):** Sends the topic to a text generation model (like GPT-4) with instructions for length, tone, and key points if provided.
   4. **Action 3 (OpenAI node):** Receives the drafted blog post.
   5. **Action 4 (Google Sheets node):** Logs the request and the generated content title.
   6. **Action 5 (Google Drive node):** Saves the full blog post as a document.
   7. **Action 6 (Telegram node):** Informs you that the draft is ready.
* **Workflow for Making Mini-Movies:**
   1. **Trigger:** Command via Telegram (e.g., ""Create video: 'Product X showcase' using images A, B, C and voiceover script Y"").
   2. **Action 1 (n8n):** Gathers the specified images and voiceover script.
   3. **Action 2 (11 Labs node - optional):** If the script needs to be converted to audio, it sends the text to a text-to-speech service.
   4. **Action 3 (Runway or Creatomate node):** Sends the images, audio, and any other parameters (like video template ID) to a video creation/rendering service.
   5. **Action 4 (Service node):** Receives the rendered video.
   6. **Action 5 (Google Drive node):** Saves the video.
   7. **Action 6 (Telegram node):** Sends you the completed video.

These are simplified examples. Real workflows can have more steps, conditional logic (""if this, then that""), and error handling. The beauty of n8n is that you can build these visually.

# Your Free n8n Template: Getting Started is Easier Than You Think

The good news is you don't always have to build these complex workflows from scratch. Often, creators like Nate Herk (mentioned in the source material) share pre-configured n8n workflow templates as JSON files. A JSON file is just a text-based format for structuring data.

You can import this JSON file directly into your n8n instance. This gives you a ready-made workflow structure. You'll still need to connect your own accounts for the various services (like putting in your OpenAI API key), but the logic and the connections between the nodes are already set up for you. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and lets you get a sophisticated AI marketing system up and running much more quickly.

# The Toolkit: What Powers Your AI Marketing Agent?

To bring your AI marketing agent to life, you'll need a selection of tools and services that work together. Each plays a specific role, and n8n acts as the central nervous system connecting them all. Here’s a look at the typical components:

# The Brains: OpenAI for Content and Images

OpenAI provides powerful models like GPT (for text generation – think blog posts, social media updates, emails) and DALL-E (for image generation from text descriptions). These are often the core ""creative"" engines in your AI setup. You interact with them via their APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which n8n can easily connect to.

# The Organizers: Google Sheets and Drive

These familiar Google tools are incredibly useful for the practical side of managing your AI's output:

* **Google Sheets:** Can be used as a simple database to log requests, track the status of tasks, store generated text snippets, or even manage lists of content ideas.
* **Google Drive:** Perfect for storing the files your AI agent produces, such as generated images, drafted documents, and final video files.

# The Messenger: Telegram for Easy Commands

As mentioned, Telegram is a popular choice for the user interface. Its bot capabilities allow n8n to receive commands from you via simple text messages and send back results or notifications. This makes interacting with your complex backend system feel as easy as chatting with a contact.

# The Movie Makers: Runway and Creatomate

When it comes to video, specialized tools are needed:

* **RunwayML (Runway):** Offers a suite of AI magic tools, including video editing capabilities, text-to-video, image-to-video, and more. It can be used for rendering video clips or applying AI effects.
* **Creatomate:** This platform excels at automated video generation, especially using templates. You can design a video template (with placeholders for images, text, colors) and then use its API to automatically create many variations of that video by feeding it different data.

# The Sound Designer: 11 Labs for Audio

For adding voiceovers to videos or creating other audio content, 11 Labs is a leading text-to-speech (TTS) service. It's known for producing very natural-sounding AI voices in various languages and accents. You can send text to 11 Labs via its API, and it returns an audio file.

# The Image Enhancer: PI API (Optional Advanced Touch)

While OpenAI's DALL-E is great for generating images, sometimes you need more specific editing capabilities for existing images. The ""PI API"" mentioned in the source likely refers to an image processing API that can handle tasks like precise color adjustments, adding specific text overlays with font control, or other detailed manipulations that go beyond basic generation.

# The Conductor: n8n Cloud – Bringing It All Together

N8n Cloud is the hosted version of the n8n platform. This means you don't have to set up and manage your own server to run n8n. You sign up for an account, and they handle the infrastructure. This is where you'll import your JSON workflow templates, configure your API keys for all the other services, and where your automated workflows will actually run. It’s the central hub that orchestrates all the other tools.

# Building Your AI Team: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide

Getting your AI-powered marketing assistant up and running might sound complicated, but by following a structured approach and using pre-built templates, it's quite manageable. Here’s a general outline of the steps involved:

# Step 1: Grab Your n8n Template

The journey often begins by finding a suitable n8n workflow template. These are usually shared as JSON files. Download this file to your computer. This template contains the pre-designed logic for the marketing tasks you want to automate (e.g., a template for blog post generation or one for social media video creation).

# Step 2: Connect Your Tools (API Keys Explained Simply)

Most of the external services your AI agent will use (OpenAI, Google, Runway, 11 Labs, etc.) require an API key or similar credentials.

* **What's an API Key?** Think of an API key as a secret password that allows one application (like n8n) to talk to another application (like OpenAI) on your behalf and access your account with that service.
* **Getting Them:** You'll need to sign up for accounts with each service you plan to use. Within your account settings on each service's website, you'll find a section for API keys or developer credentials. Generate your keys there. Keep them secure!
* **Adding to n8n:** In n8n, when you add a node for a specific service (e.g., an OpenAI node), it will have a place for you to enter your API key for that service. This authorizes n8n to use that service.

# Step 3: Set Up Your Digital Filing Cabinet (Google Sheets & Drive)

Decide where your AI will store its outputs and log its activities.

* Create specific folders in Google Drive for images, videos, and documents.
* Set up Google Sheets with appropriate columns if you want to log requests, track content, or manage data for your workflows. You'll then configure the Google Sheets and Google Drive nodes in your n8n workflow to point to these specific locations.

# Step 4: Prepare Your Video Templates (Creatomate Basics)

If your AI agent will be creating videos using a tool like Creatomate, you'll first need to design your video templates within the Creatomate platform.

* A template defines the layout, animations, and placeholders for dynamic content (like text, images, colors).
* Once your template is ready in Creatomate, it will have an ID. You'll use this Template ID in your n8n workflow so the AI knows which video design to use and what elements to customize.

# Step 5: Test, Tweak, and Go!

This is a critical step. Before relying on your AI agent for important tasks, test each workflow thoroughly.

* **Manual Triggers:** In n8n, you can manually execute a workflow to see if it runs correctly from start to finish.
* **Check Each Step:** Look at the output of each node to make sure the data is flowing as expected and the services are responding correctly.
* **Troubleshoot:** If something goes wrong, n8n provides logs and error messages to help you identify the problem. It might be an incorrect API key, a misconfigured node, or an issue with one of the external services.
* **Refine:** You might need to tweak prompts for AI content generation, adjust settings in your video templates, or modify the logic in your n8n workflow to get the results you want.

Once you're confident that everything is working smoothly, you can activate your workflows and let your AI marketing assistant start handling tasks based on the triggers you've set up (like receiving a Telegram message).

# The Big Question: What Does This AI Marketing Team Cost?

One of the most appealing aspects of building an AI-driven marketing system is its potential for cost-efficiency, especially when compared to the expense of hiring a traditional multi-person marketing team. Let's look at how the costs break down.

# A Pleasant Surprise: Comparing AI vs. Traditional Costs

Hiring a dedicated content writer, a graphic designer, a video editor, and a social media manager can quickly add up to thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars per month in salaries, benefits, and overhead. For many small businesses or startups, this is simply not feasible.

An AI-powered system, while not free, operates on a pay-as-you-go or subscription model for the tools it uses. This means your costs are often directly related to your usage, which can be significantly lower than full-time salaries, particularly when you're starting out or have fluctuating needs.

# Breaking Down the Numbers (Estimates):

The costs for the individual tools can vary based on your usage and the specific pricing plans you choose. Here are some general estimates based on the information provided in the source article:

* **OpenAI (for text and image generation):**
   * Images: Around $0.02 to $0.20 per image, depending on the model and resolution.
   * Text: Prices vary greatly by model (e.g., GPT-3.5 is cheaper than GPT-4) and are usually based on the amount of text processed (tokens). Simpler models for text can be very affordable.
* **Runway (for video rendering/editing):**
   * Approximately $0.05 to $0.25 per 5-second video clip or per unit of processing, but check their latest pricing.
* **PI API (or similar advanced image processing):**
   * Around $0.015 per image for specific advanced processing tasks.
* **11 Labs (for sound effect/voice generation):**
   * Offers a free tier, with paid plans starting around $5 per month for a certain number of characters or usage.
* **Creatomate (for video rendering templates and automation):**
   * Often has a free trial or a free tier with a limited number of credits (e.g., 50 credits). Paid plans scale with usage.
* **N8n Cloud (for hosting workflows and managing integrations):**
   * Paid plans start from around $20-$30 per month, depending on the tier and resource needs (like number of workflow executions).

**Example Scenario:**Imagine you generate 50 blog post drafts, 100 social media images, and 20 short videos in a month.

* OpenAI Text: Could be $5-$20 (highly variable)
* OpenAI Images: 100 images \* $0.04/image = $4
* Runway/Creatomate Videos: 20 videos \* (let's say $0.50/video average) = $10
* 11 Labs: $5 (starter plan)
* N8n Cloud: $27
* **Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** Around $51 - $86 (excluding any one-time setup or more advanced image processing).

This is a rough estimate, but it illustrates that the operational costs can be very manageable, especially when you consider the volume of output.

# The Value Beyond Pennies: Time Saved, Efficiency Gained

Beyond the direct monetary costs, consider the immense value of the time you save. Tasks that might have taken hours of manual work can be completed in minutes by your AI agent. This frees you or your team members to focus on higher-level strategy, customer interaction, creative ideation, and other areas where human intelligence truly shines. The ability to scale content production and marketing activities without proportionally increasing headcount is a massive advantage.

# Real-World Magic: How Businesses Can Use This AI Setup

This AI-driven marketing system isn't just a theoretical concept; it has practical applications that can make a real difference to businesses of all sizes. Here’s how it can be put to work:

# Consistent Content Creation Without Burnout

Maintaining a regular schedule of blog posts, articles, and social media updates is vital for audience engagement and SEO. However, it can also lead to content creator burnout.

* **How AI Helps:** Your AI agent can draft initial versions of blog posts from outlines, generate multiple social media captions for a single piece of content, or even repurpose existing content into new formats. This provides a steady stream of material that human editors can then refine and personalize, ensuring consistency without the constant pressure of starting from a blank page.

# Eye-Catching Social Media Videos on Autopilot

Short-form video is dominant on platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Creating these consistently can be a challenge.

* **How AI Helps:** Using video templates in Creatomate and AI-generated visuals or stock footage, the system can automatically produce short, engaging videos. These could be product highlights, animated text explainers, or quick tips related to your industry. Schedule these to go out regularly to keep your social feeds active and visually appealing.

# Quick Visuals for Promotions and Branding

Need a graphic for a flash sale? A banner for your latest blog post? Or simple illustrations for a presentation?

* **How AI Helps:** Instead of waiting for a designer or struggling with complex software, you can use the AI image generation capabilities to quickly create or modify visuals. This allows for rapid responses to marketing opportunities and ensures your branding remains fresh and dynamic. For instance, generating themed images for holidays or special events becomes much simpler.

# Streamlining Repetitive Chores, Freeing Up Your Genius

Many marketing tasks are repetitive: compiling reports, formatting content, searching for assets, posting to multiple platforms.

* **How AI Helps:** By automating these routine operations, your AI agent acts like a tireless administrative assistant. This frees up human marketers to concentrate on strategic planning, analyzing campaign performance, engaging with customers, and developing innovative ideas – the tasks that require human creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. Imagine the time saved by automatically logging every piece of generated content or by having images instantly filed in the correct cloud storage folder.

This system allows businesses to punch above their weight, achieving a level of marketing output and sophistication that might previously have seemed out of reach without a large team or budget.

# Looking Ahead: Challenges and What's Next

While this AI-powered marketing system offers incredible advantages, it's good to be aware of its current limitations and the exciting possibilities for its future development.

# Current Hurdles: Where Things Can Get Tricky

No technology is perfect, and this AI-driven approach has a few areas where you might encounter challenges:

* **Nuances in Video Generation:** While AI can assemble video clips, add music, and generate voiceovers, achieving a specific artistic style or complex narrative flow in videos might still require manual adjustments or more sophisticated (and potentially expensive) tools. The quality of purely AI-generated video from text prompts is still evolving.
* **Reliability of Automated Steps:** Sometimes, an API might be temporarily down, or an AI model might misinterpret a very nuanced prompt. Building robust error handling into your n8n workflows is helpful. For tasks like image or video generation that can be a bit more subjective, you might find that some outputs need a second attempt with a revised prompt to get the desired result. Polling mechanisms (checking periodically if a long task like video rendering is complete) can sometimes be tricky to perfect.
* **Maintaining Authenticity:** AI-generated content can sometimes lack the unique voice or deep understanding that a human expert brings. It's often best used as a ""first draft"" or an ""assistant,"" with human oversight and refinement to ensure authenticity and quality.

# The Bright Future: Continuous Improvement

The field of AI is advancing at an astonishing pace. The limitations of today are often overcome by the breakthroughs of tomorrow:

* **Better AI Models:** Expect AI models for text, image, and video generation to become even more sophisticated, capable, and easier to control.
* **Improved Integration Tools:** Platforms like n8n are constantly adding new integrations and features, making it easier to connect even more services.
* **More Intuitive Interfaces:** The way we interact with these systems will likely become even more natural, perhaps with more advanced voice control or even AI agents that can proactively suggest marketing actions.

As these technologies mature, the capabilities of your AI marketing assistant will only grow, and the current challenges will likely diminish.

# Your Role in the AI Partnership

It’s key to remember that this AI system is a tool – a very powerful one, but still a tool. Human oversight, strategy, and creativity remain indispensable.

* **Strategic Direction:** You define the marketing goals, the target audience, the brand voice, and the overall campaign strategies. The AI executes based on your direction.
* **Quality Control:** You review and refine the AI-generated content to ensure it meets your standards, aligns with your brand, and truly connects with your audience.
* **Ethical Considerations:** You are responsible for using AI ethically, ensuring that your marketing is honest, transparent, and respects user privacy.

Think of it as a partnership: you provide the vision and the critical thinking, and your AI agent provides the tireless execution and scale.

# Ready to Build Your Own AI Marketing Assistant?

The prospect of assembling a marketing ""team"" with a single AI agent and no coding might have seemed like a distant dream just a short while ago. Now, it's a tangible reality. With tools like n8n providing the framework, and specialized AI services like OpenAI, Runway, and Creatomate offering the creative power, you can construct a remarkably capable marketing automation system.

This isn't about replacing human marketers but empowering them. It's about taking the load of repetitive, time-consuming tasks and freeing up human ingenuity for strategy, creativity, and connection. Whether you're a solo entrepreneur trying to wear all the hats, a small business aiming to scale efficiently, or a larger organization looking to optimize resources, this approach offers a pathway to achieving more with less. The initial setup requires some learning and configuration, but the availability of templates and the supportive no-code community can make the journey much smoother. The future of agile, efficient, and intelligent marketing is here, and it’s more accessible than ever.

1khnlkd,https://v.redd.it/88v03cniljze1,What Skills Will Become Obsolete in the Next 5 Years?,"The Skills Time is Leaving Behind: How to Adapt and Stay Relevant in the AI Era

AI and automation are making some jobs obsolete fast. Discover which skills are fading by 2029—and what to learn now to future-proof your career.

Technology is evolving faster than ever, and once-valuable skills are quietly slipping into history. With AI, automation, and shifting job trends, some career staples are vanishing—and failing to adapt could leave you sidelined.

A 2024 LinkedIn report found that 44% of workers’ core skills will change within five years, and McKinsey predicts AI could automate tasks across 60-70% of jobs by 2030. Clearly, upskilling isn’t optional—it’s essential.

So, which skills are on the chopping block? Here’s a data-driven look at what’s going obsolete by 2029—and where smart professionals should pivot next.

1. Basic Data Entry & Manual Record-Keeping

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ Tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Bard automate admin tasks.
✅ Automated CRMs and databases are becoming the norm.
✅ AI effortlessly transcribes meetings and organizes data.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 Data Analysis & Interpretation
AI gathers the data—but humans extract the meaning.

Example: Instead of entering numbers in Excel, master Python, SQL, or Power BI.

🔑 Takeaway: AI replaces repetitive input, not human insight.

2. Basic Customer Service & Support Roles
🚨 Why It’s Dying
AI chatbots and assistants handle routine inquiries 24/7—no coffee required.

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ AI resolves up to 85% of customer service interactions (Gartner, 2023).
✅ Automated call centers and chatbots are everywhere.
✅ Zendesk AI and others are taking over FAQs.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 Complex Problem-Solving & Emotional Intelligence

Example: Shift from answering simple questions to managing customer relationships and conflict resolution.

🔑 Takeaway: Robots can respond—but they can’t relate.

3. Manual Accounting & Traditional Bookkeeping
🚨 Why It’s Dying
AI accounting software tracks expenses, reconciles books, and files taxes automatically.

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ QuickBooks and FreshBooks automate bookkeeping.
✅ AI tax tools are replacing preparers.
✅ AI-driven fraud detection outpaces human efforts.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 Financial Strategy & AI-Driven Finance

Example: Focus on financial forecasting, strategic planning, and risk analysis.

🔑 Takeaway: AI handles the math—humans handle the meaning.

4. Basic Coding & Simple Web Development
🚨 Why It’s Dying
AI and no-code platforms can now build apps and websites in minutes.

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ No-code tools like Webflow and Bubble make coding optional.
✅ AI generates websites from text prompts.
✅ Companies value system design over front-end tweaks.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 Advanced AI Integration, Cybersecurity & Architecture

Example: Go beyond HTML—master AI-powered app development and blockchain.

🔑 Takeaway: Basic coding may be easy now, but AI still needs smart architects.

(Fun fact: AI can generate code, but still panics at your uncle’s ""Can you fix my Wi-Fi?"" request.)
 

5. Traditional Project Management Without AI Tools
🚨 Why It’s Dying
AI can schedule, allocate resources, and even assign tasks better than old-school PM methods.

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ Monday.com and ClickUp use AI for workflow optimization.
✅ Chatbots manage projects in real-time.
✅ Agile methods are evolving with AI insights.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 AI-Augmented Project Management & Strategic Leadership

Example: Master AI-enhanced task management and cross-functional team leadership.

🔑 Takeaway: AI organizes tasks—leaders inspire teams.

6. Basic Graphic Design & Simple Content Creation
🚨 Why It’s Dying
AI tools create logos, social media posts, and even videos at lightning speed.

📌 Signs It’s Fading
✅ Canva AI and DALL·E create professional visuals instantly.
✅ Marketing teams rely on AI for rapid content production.
✅ Freelancers are losing gigs to automated platforms.

🔄 What to Learn Instead
🚀 Creative Direction, Brand Strategy & AI-Assisted Design

Example: Shift from simple graphics to brand storytelling and motion design.

🔑 Takeaway: AI can design—but it can't dream.

7. Manual Factory & Warehouse Jobs
🚨 Why It’s Dying
Robotics and automation are reducing human roles in repetitive labor.

📌 Signs It’s Fading

Final Thoughts: How to Stay Ahead of AI
The jobs of yesterday are fading, but new roles are opening for those who adapt. Here's the shift in simple terms:

✔ Data Entry → Data Interpretation
✔ Customer Service → Emotional Intelligence
✔ Bookkeeping → Financial Strategy
✔ Basic Coding → AI-Powered Development
✔ Simple Design → Creative Direction
✔ Project Management → AI-Optimized Leadership
✔ Manual Labor → Robotics Management

AI may be evolving rapidly—but thankfully, it still can't host a dinner party or survive an existential crisis. That’s still your competitive edge.

1khnktr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPSC/comments/1khnktr/tried_to_confess_to_a_girl_at_the_libraryshe_got/,Tried to confess to a girl at the library—she got scared and reported me. Feeling confused and pretty low.,"So, something happened yesterday and it’s been eating me up inside. I’m posting here because I don’t know where else to share it or get some perspective.

There’s this girl I’ve seen a few times at the library—never talked to her before, but she always seemed kind and focused.

Yesterday, I decided to finally go up and talk to her. I didn’t do anything dramatic—just approached her with some space between us, stayed respectful, and tried to ask her out for a coffee and wanted to get to know her if she was open to it. I didn’t pressure her, didn’t invade her space, and genuinely tried to be polite and clear that she was free to say no.

But the moment passed, and later on, I found out she had complained to the library owner, saying I approached her and made her uncomfortable. That she was scared.

I’m not here to bash her—I understand women have every right to feel safe and guarded, especially when someone they don’t know suddenly approaches them. But I can’t lie—this really stung. I wasn’t rude or creepy (at least I didn’t intend to be), and I kept physical distance. I just… confessed, like they do in movies or stories. But I guess in real life, it doesn’t work like that.

This whole thing has really messed with my mental state. I’ve never been the overconfident, flirty type. Just gathering the courage to speak to her took everything in me. And now, after being seen as some kind of threat when I tried to be respectful, I don’t think I’ll ever feel comfortable approaching a girl again.

It’s also affecting my studies and with the exam right around the corner, I’m supposed to be locked in, focused. But my self-esteem has taken such a hit that it’s hard to concentrate. I keep overthinking—was I wrong? Was it creepy even if I didn’t intend it to be? Am I just socially tone-deaf?

Now I feel like a creep, even though I didn’t do anything wrong on purpose. I’m not angry at her, just sad and confused. Was I completely out of line for trying to talk to her this way? Is confessing feelings to someone you don’t know always inappropriate now?

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from women. I genuinely want to understand how I could have handled this differently or if I just need to accept that it was a misjudged move.

Thanks for reading.

1khnihf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1khnihf/uncover_if_the_olixis_ice_maker_countertop_is/,Uncover if the OLIXIS Ice Maker Countertop is Worth It in This Review,"Testing out the OLIXIS Ice Maker Countertop model IM001-L1 was both an interesting and surprisingly smooth experience. I never thought I’d need an ice maker until I found myself hosting frequent gatherings where warm beverages weren’t cutting it. From the moment I unpacked this sleek ice machine, its modern, glossy black finish caught my eye. It aligns effortlessly with my kitchen appliances, being compact enough to fit nicely on my countertop without dominating the space.

**Small but Smart Design**

The first thing that stands out about this countertop ice maker is its size. With dimensions of 8.8 x 12.5 x 11.6 inches, it barely takes up any space, even in my tiny kitchen. Weighing just 17.6 pounds, it’s lightweight too, and the carry handle makes it portable. I've transported it between my kitchen counter and the patio for outdoor parties without breaking a sweat. Its modern design also includes a transparent viewing window, which I admit is oddly satisfying to peek through while ice is being made.

**Performance and Ice Production**

What stole the spotlight during my testing was its speed. This device produces 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. As someone who loathes waiting, this feature was amazing. Filling up the water tank with a capacity of 1.2 liters, it churns out enough ice to last through several rounds of drinks. It claims to produce up to 26 pounds of ice in a 24-hour period, and I have no reason to doubt it—I ran it all day during a party and it kept up with demand easily. 

[Check OLIXIS IM001-L1 price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dkntvfz2/)

**Two Sizes, Plenty of Functionality**

This ice maker allows you to choose between two sizes of bullet-shaped ice cubes. I switched it up depending on my needs—smaller cubes for seafood platters and bigger cubes for cocktails. I even used the smaller cubes while prepping some iced coffee for family brunch. The smooth bullet design is a nice touch since, unlike some square ice cubes, it doesn’t hurt your fingers when scooping or holding them. This machine really takes versatility seriously, and it produces high-quality ice that's good for multiple uses.

**Convenience of the Self-Cleaning Feature**

A major highlight for me is the self-cleaning feature. Cleaning kitchen gadgets is my least favorite chore, so being able to start the cleaning process by simply pressing the on/off button for five seconds was a game changer. It cleared away residue effortlessly after a long-day use, ensuring the production of clean ice cubes while saving me time and effort.

**Operation and Noise Levels**

The control panel is intuitive to use—I figured it out in less than a minute. It'll remind you about low water levels or a full ice basket via indicator lights, so it’s practically foolproof. When running, the noise level is quieter than I expected (around 40dB), comparable to my refrigerator. It didn’t disturb any conversations or background music when I used it indoors during gatherings.

**Good Points**

- Quick ice production: 9 cubes in just 6 minutes  
- Compact and portable design with a carry handle  
- Two bullet ice cube sizes for various needs  
- Self-cleaning function for easy maintenance  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The machine does not store the ice for long periods, as it slowly melts if not transferred to a freezer.  
- The beep notification for a full ice basket can be a bit startling if you’re in a quiet environment.  
- While the design is robust, the glossy finish is prone to smudges and requires frequent wiping.  

**Competitive Options**

Compared to other countertop ice makers like those from GE or Frigidaire, this one sets itself apart with its balance of performance and portability. While some competitors offer larger capacities, they tend to be bulkier, taking up valuable counter space. The OLIXIS unit, on the other hand, fits anywhere and starts producing ice almost immediately, whereas competitors often take longer to initiate. However, some brands include built-in freezer storage for already-produced ice, reducing the need to transfer cubes to the freezer frequently. That said, the OLIXIS machine compensates for this minor shortfall with its intuitive self-cleaning and dual ice sizes.

**Bang for the Buck**

While I can’t give you an exact price since it fluctuates, the value this product delivers for its cost is undeniable. With its swift functionality, portability, and smart features like the self-cleaning mechanism, this ice maker offers a good return on investment. For those juggling between picking convenience and effectiveness, this model proves you can have both.

I’m particularly interested in international trade and energy on the regulatory side (law school experience/internships) and complex/consumer protection litigation on the litigation side (clerkship experience).

The past couple months, I’ve been networking my ass off. Cold emails, alumni coffee connections throughout the city, etc. That being said, I’m not quite sure how to make the jump from the informal networking to the interview offer stage. I didn’t participate in OCI in law school, so I don’t have the great connections with the firms that some applicants do. Further, I’m fully aware of the totally flushed market thanks to the President. As such, I’ve basically been resorting to “hey would it be okay if I drop your name in my cover letter?” and hoping something sticks. It all seems so surface level and performative.

me 23M and my friend 22F have been friends for about two years. this past year i had to cut her off because my gf wanted to which was fine w me bc i respect my gf. (she was abusive but that doesn’t matter) She was upset about it though, i asked her if i could apologize last september, she ignored. also background, we both liked eachother supposedly at one point, ive slept in the same bed as her like 4 times but never physically touched not even cuddled.

Now, me and my ex broke up. Friend had let me apologize early last week and meet up for coffee. Quick to the point, she accepted my apology and was sorry i went through so much abuse, we ended up drinking after getting coffee. she confessed she had then feelings but she was hurt that i ghosted her, rightfully so. Anyways we drank, she insisted i stayed the night, i did, i kissed her, we cuddled and slept over. 

Then fast forward last weekend, she had invited me to go out with her when we were at coffee, yada yada stayed the night again, cuddled, kissed her the next morning. we talked in the morning, she said i could of fucked her when i was over the first time???? anyways, curveball. but we said didn’t want a relationship right now which was fine but we’re open to seeing where it went. She does like me.

Now my predicament is, by no means am i asking her to text me every hour, minute, second. But she hasn’t texted me back in 2-3 days. so i went through a bad relationship wondering if my own gf loved me(obv not) but i don’t like the feeling of not knowing if she still likes me or not. Cause me personally, i would like to talk to the person i have feelings for every day. It is finals and she said she will be locked it, ig it’s fine. she said we could hangout again if i wanted to chill with her while she does school stuff. So basically what im asking is, Can you have feelings for someone and not want to text them everyday? i’ve never dealt with that in any relationship i’ve been in. Does her not texting reflect how she feels about me? i’m obv gonna talk to her soon, but i just don’t want to make a big deal about it if it’s not a big deal. i just don’t want to put in effort for someone that doesn’t do the same for me.

Fellow ‘Spoonie’, here, if you’ve ever heard of the term..

Seems like the new refurbishments at POFQ leave little space for a crib or pack ‘n play, especially with the bench and tv/coffee/fridge stand. 

Looking at the value resorts with murphy beds, it seems like that may work better. Looks like the tv stand at value resorts is more compact leaving more space for a crib/pnp. I also like the idea of putting up the Murphy bed during the day for more space.

I understand the rooms are bigger at POFQ, but I’m thinking the layout leaves less space than a value resort if a crib/pnp were to be added.

My vision slowly returned, my eyes struggling to focus as I took in my surroundings. I lay sprawled on the living room floor, the rough shag carpet scraping against my cheek. My wine glass was still in my hand, but the red wine it had contained was now soaking into the carpet near my head.

Or was that blood?

I reached up to my face, feeling the heat radiating from my cheeks as I assessed the damage. I gingerly probed the bridge of my nose and winced at the searing pain. Broken, probably, but no blood.

I took a shaky breath, trying to steady myself. The room spun slightly as I rose, and I gripped the edge of the coffee table for support. My husband's eyes bore into me, cold and unforgiving.

""I'm sorry, Craig"" I whispered, my voice barely audible. It was a reflex, an ingrained response to his anger.

His eyes flashed with a dangerous mixture of rage and contempt. ""Don't you dare try to make me feel guilty,"" he spat. ""You brought this on yourself.”

I flinched at his words, feeling a familiar cocktail of shame and fear rising within me. Part of me wanted to apologize again, to beg forgiveness for whatever I’d done to set him off this time. But a small, defiant voice in the back of my mind whispered that this wasn't right, that I didn't deserve this.

Slowly, I backed towards the hallway, my eyes never leaving his face. ""I know, I did,” I whispered. “And I’m going to make it right.”

His eyes bore into me with a chilling inensity as I edged away, trying to make it seem like I was retreating upstairs to nurse my wounds and reflect on my actions. But deep down, I knew that I couldn't stay any longer. The next time he hit me, it would be worse. He had never struck me in such a visible place before - next time, he might even kill me.

As I reached the foyer, glancing back to ensure he wasn't following me, I frantically grabbed my keys from the table at the bottom of the staircase and bolted toward the front door.

""Laura! What the FUCK do you think you're—"" His angry shout was abruptly cut off as I slammed the door shut behind me. My hand shook as I pressed a button on my keys, the loud chirping noise filling the tense air of the night.

I was already buckled into my car and reversing out of the driveway when he appeared by my window, pounding on it with furious fists.

“Baby, please,” he begged softly, trying to sound sweet even though he was still clearly seething with rage. “I’m sorry. Just come back inside and let’s talk about this.”

I slammed on the gas as I finally reached the road. My tires squealed against the pavement, but it wasn’t loud enough to drown out his final words.

“You’ll fucking regret this, you BITCH!”

———————————————

I felt lost and alone as I drove aimlessly, unsure of where my next steps would lead me. The few people I had once considered friends were now distant acquaintances, all tied to my husband and his social circle. I had left everything behind, with only the clothes on my back to call my own. Panic washed over me as it registered that I didn’t have my phone or my wallet, leaving me completely vulnerable in this wicked place. Tears threatened to spill from my eyes as the overwhelming reality of my situation weighed down on me.

My heart raced as I made my way down the familiar highway toward the only place I could think of for refuge. But as my car drew closer to Warriors territory, where my brother's biker club reigned supreme, doubts and anxieties gnawed at me. It had been years since I’d last seen or spoken to him, at our mother's funeral.

The memory of her passing four years ago still weighed heavily on my mind. She was the strongest woman I had ever known. She’d raised Jake and I completely on her own, after our scumbag of a father took off when I was less than a year old.

Her funeral was also the last time I had any contact with anyone from my hometown. That day, amidst the tears and condolences, a heated argument erupted between Craig and I that ended up becoming public knowledge. My brother, who happened to be the President of the biker club, wasted no time in running Craig out of town with me in tow.

Since then, Craig had slowly but surely isolated me from my friends and loved ones. Our home was two hours away from my hometown, making it nearly impossible for me to accidentally run into anyone I knew in public. And on top of that, he closely monitored my phone calls and interactions, leaving little room for me to reach out to others without his knowledge.

But now, in a moment of bravery and desperation, I found myself driving towards my brother's house in search of some sense of comfort and familiarity. Uncertainty tugged at my heart, but I pushed forward despite it. This could potentially be my chance at reclaiming a piece of my old life back - or it could lead to even more chaos and upheaval. Only time would tell.

# Chapter 2

It was pushing midnight by the time I pulled up to the farmhouse where I grew up. There were four beat up pickup trucks and twelve motorcycles lining the driveway.

My heart sank. Jake must be having one of his infamous parties. He hadn’t heard from me in years, and now I was about to crash his gathering looking like I’d been in a bar fight. I hesitated, my hand on the handle of the car door. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all.

But where else could I go? I had no money, no phone, and Craig would be looking for me. I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car.

I stood for a moment, checking myself over. My heart pounded with a mix of fear and determination. Craig had always been disgusted at the way I chose to dress, always wanting me to conform to his idea of luxury and perfection. But tonight, I didn't have time to put on a facade. I glanced down at my ratty gray slippers, frayed around the edges from years of use. My blue plaid pajama shorts barely covered my trembling legs, and my thin gray tank top and black modal robe did little to protect me from the chilly fall air.

As I shivered, goosebumps spread across my exposed skin, revealing faded bruises scattered across my bare legs and chest. These were souvenirs from previous unwarranted ""lessons"" taught by my loving husband. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of shame and anger as I took in the evidence of his abuse.

Turning to look at my reflection in the car window, I couldn't help but wince at the sight. My blonde hair was disheveled and falling out of the messy bun on top of my head. My nose was purple and swollen, and dark bruises were beginning to creep in under both eyes. I looked rough, like a victim who had taken one too many beatings. But tonight, I was determined not to let Craig break me anymore. Tonight, I would stand up for myself and finally take back control of my life.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped toward the house. As I approached, I could hear the faint thrum of music and laughter. The old wooden steps creaked under my weight, a familiar sound that brought back a flood of childhood memories. The porch light flickered, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown lawn. I raised my hand to knock, then paused. What if Jake was mad at me? What if he turned me away?

Before I could second-guess myself further, the door creaked open. A towering figure stood in the doorway, his broad shoulders filling the frame. His black beard was trimmed short, and his hair was pulled into a bun at the back of his head. His leather vest gleamed under the dim light of the hallway.

“Shut the fuck up, Wilson, I’ll be right b—” his deep voice boomed over the thump of the music as he turned to face me, nearly knocking me over with his force.

He froze when he saw me, recognition flashing through his piercing green eyes. It was Talon Nash, my brother’s best friend. His hand still hovered on the doorknob as he took in my appearance - the bruises marring my skin, the tangled mess of my hair, and the worn-out pajamas that barely covered me. Heat rushed to my cheeks as his gaze moved slowly down my body, cataloguing every detail with a mix of concern and surprise.

“Holy shit,” he muttered, his brow furrowing. “Laura?”

I nodded, suddenly feeling very small and vulnerable. “I… I need to see Jake,” I managed to whisper, my voice cracking.

Talon’s expression shifted from surprise to concern. Without a word, he gently placed a hand on my shoulder and guided me inside. The warmth of the house enveloped me, along with the smell of beer and cigarettes. The party was in full swing, with people crowded into every corner of the living room.

“Wilson!” he bellowed over the noise and glanced at a girl with black hair and tattoos who was sitting by the sound system. “Becky, turn down the fuckin music. Where’s Prez?”

Summoned by Talon’s booming voice, Jake emerged from the kitchen, a beer bottle in hand and a confused expression on his face.

“What the fuck, Nash, I thought you were going outsi—” His eyes widened as they landed on me, and the bottle slipped from his hand, shattering on the hardwood floor.

“Laura?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the music.

The room fell silent as everyone turned to stare at us. I felt my cheeks burn once more with embarrassment, all too aware of how I must look to all these strangers. Jake pushed his way through the crowd, his eyes never leaving my face. 

“What the hell happened to you?” he demanded, his voice a mixture of concern and anger.

I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, I felt hot tears start to roll down my cheeks. Jake’s expression softened, and without hesitation, he pulled me into a rough embrace. I sobbed into his chest, letting the enormous weight of the evening fall from my shoulders.

We stood like that for a few minutes before he moved and held me back at arm’s length to look me over.

“Craig did this to you, didn’t he… I never fuckin liked that guy.”

I nodded weakly, unable to meet Jake’s eyes. The shame I felt was overwhelming, but a small part of me was relieved to finally admit the truth.

Jake’s face hardened, his jaw clenching as he processed my silent confirmation. “I’ll kill him,” he growled, his hands balling into fists at his sides.",1,1746701773.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

“You can quit your job after marrying me. You just need to take good care of me at our home and give me a chubby little son within a year! No daughters, please. Daughters are expensive to raise!”

How very condescending.

The man who made that remark sat in front of Corrinne Carew, and he happened to be her prospective partner during a matchmaking session. At nearly 40 years of age, his hair was thinning and he had a pot belly.

Corinne’s stepmother, Lilliana Reece, was worried that she might end up marrying someone better and so forced her to meet with this crass, middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was initially very displeased with Corinne’s dark makeup because it was really heavy on the eyeshadow, but upon seeing her slender figure and decent character, he could imagine how deliciously beautiful she would be if she stood naked in front of him.

“And how tall are you again?” he asked.

Corinne absent-mindedly stirred the coffee inside the cup and replied curtly, “A hundred and sixty-eight centimeters.”

The middle-aged man was delighted to hear her answer. “Hmm… That’s more or less the standard of a woman that’s fit for me. My height is nearly one point eight meters, so I guess that’s what they call the perfect height difference for a couple! You’d have to tiptoe whenever you kiss me in the future, but that’s not really an issue. I can still bend you over and take you from behind!”

For the record, whenever men who like to talk big say that their height is nearly 1.8 meters, their true measurements were only 172 centimeters at most!

Corinne rolled her eye-shadowed eyelids and said, “I don’t think you’re aware of how tall a man is if his woman needs to stand on her toes to kiss him.”

The middle-aged man frowned unhappily. “What do you mean by that?”

At that point, a tall and stern-looking man walked into the cafe. He was 2.8 meters tall. As Corinne looked up and laid eyes on him, a playful twinkle appeared in her eyes. She decided to get up from her chair and walk over to him.

“Hey there, handsome. Could I borrow you for a sec to demonstrate what a true height difference is?”

The man frowned. Before he could refuse, Corinne grabbed his tie, yanked it downward, and tiptoed to plant a firm kiss on his thin lips.

“See? You need to be at least as tall as him for women to stand on tiptoe and kiss you!”

“How dare you…” The pot-bellied middle-aged man was angry due to that embarrassment. He stood up in a rage and pointed at Corinne, saying, “You wh\*re! Who the hell just grabs random men and kisses them? I’ll tell the person who introduced us to each other about your sluttiness soon enough. Your notoriousness will soon spread within the matchmaking circle, and you’ll never be able to find your perfect match here.”

‘That’d be perfect!’ Once word of her actions got out, her stepmother Lilliana would surely have a hard time trying to play matchmaker again!

Corinne snorted in disdain, kicked the crass, big-talking man away, then waved her hand in a gesture of thanks to the tall man who ‘stood up for her’ in her moment of need.

“Thanks for helping me out there, kind sir! See you around, I guess. Bye!” She ended her sentence and turned around to leave, but a palm that was cold to the touch grabbed her wrist.

“Are you just going to leave after kissing me without my consent?” a hoarse, stern male voice reached Corinne’s ears, and an oppressive chill came up her spine. She felt riveted when she looked up and saw the man’s handsome face.

His attractiveness knew no bounds.

There was a certain maturity and meticulousness in the way he styled his hair, chiseled facial features on his fair-skinned handsome face, and an expression brimming with danger and fierceness.

‘Uh-oh!’ Corinne had been so worked up about the man from her blind date that she just randomly chose the tallest man in sight without paying much attention to his appearance.

Upon a closer look, she came to realize just how uniquely handsome he really was! As if that were not enough, she could tell at a glance that there was more to him than what met the eye!

Corinne frowned slightly. “What do you expect me to do?”",1,1746701099.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1khmztf,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingreview/comments/1khmztf/the_death_of_serendipity_how_algorithms_killed/,The Death of Serendipity: How Algorithms Killed the Magic of Dating,"There was a time — not too long ago — when meeting someone “by chance” felt like the spark that lit the fire of romance. A bump at the bookstore. A shared glance on the subway. That one spontaneous night out that led to a five-year relationship.

Today? We meet through a screen, filtered, categorized, ranked, and scored.

Dating apps promised us efficiency, compatibility, and choice. What we got instead is *option fatigue*, gamification of intimacy, and algorithmic compatibility that often prioritizes engagement metrics over emotional connection.

Here’s the core problem: **the very systems designed to help us find love are optimized to keep us looking for it.**



**Algorithms Aren’t Matchmakers — They’re Attention Farmers**  
The business model of most dating platforms is brutally simple: more swipes = more ad revenue, more subscriptions, more time on the app. So instead of helping you *leave*, they make sure you *stay*.

You’re shown “just enough” attractive profiles to feel hope, but not enough to find satisfaction. Some even throttle your visibility unless you pay up. Others promote those who pay, skewing your experience away from authenticity.



**Hyper-Choice Has Paralyzed Us**  
More options were supposed to be empowering. In reality, they make us pickier, less committed, and more superficial. It’s easier to reject someone over a single line in their bio than to risk a mismatched coffee date.

We don’t chase chemistry — we filter for it. And often, we filter it out.



**Authenticity Is Being Replaced by Curation**  
You’re not dating people anymore ... you’re dating *profiles*. Everyone’s in PR mode. Bios become brand pitches. Photos are optimized. Conversations are A/B tested for replies. Vulnerability? Rare. Rawness? Risky.

We’ve learned to present a version of ourselves that pleases the algorithm and passes the first 3-second glance. But the more we optimize, the less *real* we become.



**So What Comes Next?**

Some believe in better tech — smarter algorithms, better video integration, even AI-assisted matchmaking. But here’s a more radical idea:

➡️ *What if we designed dating experiences that made people leave the app faster?*

* Events-first platforms: real meetups, not endless messages.
* Slow dating models: limited matches, longer bios, forced pauses.
* Gamified vulnerability: prompts that reward depth, not superficiality.

In the end, the solution might not be more *innovation*. It might be *less interference*. More serendipity. Less swiping.

Maybe what we need isn’t a better match, but a better way to meet.",1,1746701080.0,datingreview,0,1.0,False

What should I say?","I’ll give some background, me and my (m24) friend have known each-other roughly around 2 years now and have been good friends since. From random meet ups in coffee shops and nice walks we’ve always hit it off. From the day I met him it felt like I’d known him a life time.

Over the first few months of talking things developed and became a little more flirty over text, mostly when we’d both had a drink. This continued for nearly 2 years up until recently when I asked him out for a few drinks, he’d not been too well and I didn’t think he’d agree but surprisingly he did. After spending the entire night talking and laughing we went back to mine and put a film on. One thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping together, it was the best night of my life and honestly I felt so comfortable with him. After that he cuddled up to me and I fell asleep. Sometime in the early hours he got up and left but did text me so when I’d wake up I’d see it haha. Think he knew I’d be a little hungover. 

Forwarding on we spontaneously decided to go on a mini break nothing crazy just one night, we sat down had a few drinks and just chatted away, the night was perfect and even when we were silent it was comfortable. He was constantly checking in to see if I was warm and happy, helped me set up my little pitch so I was cosy and honestly it was perfect. 

Here’s where I’m lost, on our little night out the other week we got talking about morals and relationships and he said “if we were together, I’d look after you and provide for you it’s my job” then backtracked and said “but erm I’d do the same for anyone I’m with” then ran off to the toilet a moment later haha. Now I feel like that was a slip of tongue and he let it slip that he does like me. 

We both aren’t open people when it comes to talks like that but I am growing more and more fond of him as the days go on. I’ve always liked him but that is getting stronger and I don’t know what to say or if I should say something?

*edit: actually the first (only only?) rule should be that, in today's world, it unrealistic and unreasonable to expect anyone to immediately respond (or even respond at all) to email.*

first, i only check email once per day; in the morning over coffee while i'm waiting for computer to boot up.

second, only 1 in a 100 emails get addressed the same day.

third, many emails get 'punted' to several days in the future (to a 'no earlier than' date).

fourth, i leave some emails in my inbox but marked as 'read' so that i see them but know that time is not a factor whatsoever (could be because are merely 'never critical' 'opportunities' and/or just in there for convenient reference, e.g. my portfolio is in there for reference and as a very soft reminder that i want to print it sometime but no deadline).

fifth, everything else (i.e. not immediately clear how far to 'punt' or just need to read/process) gets immediately 'punted' until tomorrow.

lastly, i have notifications set for banner counts only so i don't even go into email unless there is something 'unread'.",1,1746700997.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

I lay sprawled on the living room floor, the rough shag carpet scraping against my cheek. My wine glass was still in my hand, but the red wine it had contained was now soaking into the carpet near my head.

Or was that blood?

I reached up to my face, feeling the heat radiating from my cheeks as I assessed the damage. I gingerly probed the bridge of my nose and winced at the searing pain. Broken, probably, but no blood.

I took a shaky breath, trying to steady myself. The room spun slightly as I rose, and I gripped the edge of the coffee table for support. My husband's eyes bore into me, cold and unforgiving.

""I'm sorry, Craig"" I whispered, my voice barely audible. It was a reflex, an ingrained response to his anger.

His eyes flashed with a dangerous mixture of rage and contempt. ""Don't you dare try to make me feel guilty,"" he spat. ""You brought this on yourself.”

I flinched at his words, feeling a familiar cocktail of shame and fear rising within me. Part of me wanted to apologize again, to beg forgiveness for whatever I’d done to set him off this time. But a small, defiant voice in the back of my mind whispered that this wasn't right, that I didn't deserve this.

Slowly, I backed towards the hallway, my eyes never leaving his face. ""I know, I did,” I whispered. “And I’m going to make it right.”

His eyes bore into me with a chilling inensity as I edged away, trying to make it seem like I was retreating upstairs to nurse my wounds and reflect on my actions. But deep down, I knew that I couldn't stay any longer. The next time he hit me, it would be worse. He had never struck me in such a visible place before - next time, he might even kill me.

As I reached the foyer, glancing back to ensure he wasn't following me, I frantically grabbed my keys from the table at the bottom of the staircase and bolted toward the front door.

""Laura! What the FUCK do you think you're—"" His angry shout was abruptly cut off as I slammed the door shut behind me. My hand shook as I pressed a button on my keys, the loud chirping noise filling the tense air of the night.

I was already buckled into my car and reversing out of the driveway when he appeared by my window, pounding on it with furious fists.

“Baby, please,” he begged softly, trying to sound sweet even though he was still clearly seething with rage. “I’m sorry. Just come back inside and let’s talk about this.”

I slammed on the gas as I finally reached the road. My tires squealed against the pavement, but it wasn’t loud enough to drown out his final words.

“You’ll fucking regret this, you BITCH!”

———————————————

I felt lost and alone as I drove aimlessly, unsure of where my next steps would lead me. The few people I had once considered friends were now distant acquaintances, all tied to my husband and his social circle. I had left everything behind, with only the clothes on my back to call my own. Panic washed over me as it registered that I didn’t have my phone or my wallet, leaving me completely vulnerable in this wicked place. Tears threatened to spill from my eyes as the overwhelming reality of my situation weighed down on me.

My heart raced as I made my way down the familiar highway toward the only place I could think of for refuge. But as my car drew closer to Warriors territory, where my brother's biker club reigned supreme, doubts and anxieties gnawed at me. It had been years since I’d last seen or spoken to him, at our mother's funeral.

The memory of her passing four years ago still weighed heavily on my mind. She was the strongest woman I had ever known. She’d raised Jake and I completely on her own, after our scumbag of a father took off when I was less than a year old.

Her funeral was also the last time I had any contact with anyone from my hometown. That day, amidst the tears and condolences, a heated argument erupted between Craig and I that ended up becoming public knowledge. My brother, who happened to be the President of the biker club, wasted no time in running Craig out of town with me in tow.

Since then, Craig had slowly but surely isolated me from my friends and loved ones. Our home was two hours away from my hometown, making it nearly impossible for me to accidentally run into anyone I knew in public. And on top of that, he closely monitored my phone calls and interactions, leaving little room for me to reach out to others without his knowledge.

But now, in a moment of bravery and desperation, I found myself driving towards my brother's house in search of some sense of comfort and familiarity.

1khmvjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1khmvjk/kendu_is_soooo_back/,KENDU is SOOOO back,"Just looking at the logarithm chart you can tell that KENDU is sooo fucking back. You can clearly see a nearly one year long downtrend has been broken, and pair this with todays incredible market... we could be sitting on something great here. Eth season COULD be back, I won't be surprised if we see eth hitting $3000 in the not too far future, which would create crazy inflows into coins like kendu (yes this isn't just bullish for Kendu but for most coins on the eth chain, but stay with me here, kendu is looking pretty nice).

Just look at this chart:

[Kendu Logarith Chart](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fkendu-just-brokeout-nothing-is-stopping-this-now-v0-y6iqe6tm4ize1.png%3Fwidth%3D1320%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D33bdce326100293d00d5a4e48c34515277f1ac53)

(sorry that the chart isn't a picture, this sub doesnt allow me to upload images to my post)

Anyway, more about kendu, Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

We've already seen this through many different products such as:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works (+ i also probably missed a couple, my bad)

Noone else does it like us. It's really that simple. Billions imminent.

But fortunately ive been accepted into uni in Australia for the winter sem. And my sem starts first week of august and hopefully id like to go and settle there late july.

For context: Now ive been working a very boring and very horrible admin job at a local college due to family pressures to ‘just get a job’ because im 18 and also because back then, i contacted a university placement agent, and she had mentioned that being employed would be a good look on my visa application for Australia. Thats also the general consensus i get from the visa conditions in the ausvisa subreddit. 

My dilemma now is, that the kettle is boiling over and i really dont wanna waste anymore time at this job. Its quite horrible, i found out that my coworkers (who are 30 years old) have been complaining that i havent been grinding the full 8 hours, 6 times a week constantly and that im not taking initiatives. They complained when i bring a book to work to read (my only respite cmon!!!). Now i know im not that diligent about work. I take a day off or two when i dont feel like it and i read a bit at work instead of joining people for coffee’s or gossip sessions. But i always do my work. However the work itself is also frustrating since i dont have a solid role or tasks. People just throw random data work or menial tasks and im at their beck and will. I have no idea how to get better at the job, i do the work im given thoroughly and honestly the work is brain numbing and just terrible for my pride. You can see how much i really hate my job. 

My original plan was to put in my one month notice (yes they require me to give A WHOLE month notice eventhough I haven’t even worked here for a year yet) at the end of may, so i can quit in june but now id like to put in my notice rn (in may, so id quite early june instead of the end) but some things are holding me back :

- first of all and most importantly my visa. I dont know how it will be affected as i have not received it yet and i dont know how it will look if i have to update my application at the end of the month (in the case i don’t receive it by then). My job isnt a big factor in my genuine student requirement (basically reasons why i chose Australia and incentives in my life that will have me return). I have stated incentives as my family and sold a point of ‘getting a bachelor’s degree will help start a career back home in my ideal field -environmental conservation (which is specific to my home country)’. Anyways this is all visa nuances that im sure people in this subreddit wont be familiar with but I HAVE posted in the ausvisa one but to no avail.

- second reason i stay is for the money but im getting severely underpaid and i could do commissions (art) on my own if i quit. Im a small artist on instagram and i have people in my dms willing to pay me 100$ per commission (depending) but rn now, i work 6 days a week and get paid 300$ a month so you do the math. I can definitely earn more.

What i need advice on:
- should i put in my one month notice now?

I could get june off, and catch up on studying the syllabus, get some time to catch a breath and even focus on my fitness goals (theres this big race in June i havent been able to prepare for) and honestly id just like some time to do teenager stuff and relax and reset my mind before this big move to aus. But im just scared about visa. Should i take the jump?

1khmrfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1khmrfq/i_failed_again_even_with_my_own_workbook_on/,I failed again — even with my own workbook on discipline. But I’m still here.,"I don’t know about others — I can only speak for myself.  
And truthfully? I’ve failed a lot. I failed at starting a YouTube channel. I failed at running an Instagram theme page. I failed at clearing a medical entrance exam. And recently, I created a workbook to build unbreakable discipline — and I’m failing again, trying to sell it. But this time… I haven’t given up. Not yet.

**1. Failure is the First Step -**  The workbook I made wasn’t for profit. I built it because I was tired of being inconsistent, distracted, and comfortable. It helped me. I’m still using it. But when I tried promoting it on Reddit, Pinterest, and other platforms — silence. No sales. More failure.

**2. People Will Criticize You -** The moment you try something different, people show up to mock it. Yesterday, I posted about my workbook. The very first comment: “Reported.” Why? Because I dared to try.  
They assume I used ChatGPT. That it’s not real. That they could do better — even though they never try.

**3. People Want Free -**  I priced the workbook at $3.99 — less than a coffee. Still, most people said, “Can I get it for free?” I even gave out a free 3-day sample. They liked it. Then they asked for the rest — still free. I realized: people would rather hit dopamine than build discipline. They’ll spend on entertainment, but hesitate to invest in real change.

**4. No Personal Brand, No Trust** \- If a big creator sold the same workbook for $50, people would buy it without question. Why? Trust. Audience. Brand. I had none of that. I still don’t. So here I am — 10 days in, no sales. Just effort.

**This is My Last Try -** I know, I'll criticize here. No pressure. No hype. No manipulation. This isn’t a sales post. This is me saying: “I’m not giving up — even if nobody buys, even if nobody replies.” The workbook is still in my profile. If it speaks to you, grab it. If not, that’s okay too. Discipline has a cost. Sometimes that cost is money. Sometimes it’s pain. Or effort. Or walking alone when others mock you. I’m paying that cost. Maybe someone else is too.

# Chapter 2

It was pushing midnight by the time I pulled up to the farmhouse where I grew up. There were four beat up pickup trucks and twelve motorcycles lining the driveway.

My heart sank. Jake must be having one of his infamous parties. He hadn’t heard from me in years, and now I was about to crash his gathering looking like I’d been in a bar fight. I hesitated, my hand on the handle of the car door. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all.

But where else could I go? I had no money, no phone, and Craig would be looking for me. I took a deep breath and stepped out of the car.

I stood for a moment, checking myself over. My heart pounded with a mix of fear and determination. Craig had always been disgusted at the way I chose to dress, always wanting me to conform to his idea of luxury and perfection. But tonight, I didn't have time to put on a facade. I glanced down at my ratty gray slippers, frayed around the edges from years of use. My blue plaid pajama shorts barely covered my trembling legs, and my thin gray tank top and black modal robe did little to protect me from the chilly fall air.

As I shivered, goosebumps spread across my exposed skin, revealing faded bruises scattered across my bare legs and chest. These were souvenirs from previous unwarranted ""lessons"" taught by my loving husband. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of shame and anger as I took in the evidence of his abuse.

Turning to look at my reflection in the car window, I couldn't help but wince at the sight. My blonde hair was disheveled and falling out of the messy bun on top of my head. My nose was purple and swollen, and dark bruises were beginning to creep in under both eyes. I looked rough, like a victim who had taken one too many beatings. But tonight, I was determined not to let Craig break me anymore. Tonight, I would stand up for myself and finally take back control of my life.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped toward the house. As I approached, I could hear the faint thrum of music and laughter. The old wooden steps creaked under my weight, a familiar sound that brought back a flood of childhood memories. The porch light flickered, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown lawn. I raised my hand to knock, then paused. What if Jake was mad at me? What if he turned me away?

Before I could second-guess myself further, the door creaked open. A towering figure stood in the doorway, his broad shoulders filling the frame. His black beard was trimmed short, and his hair was pulled into a bun at the back of his head. His leather vest gleamed under the dim light of the hallway.

“Shut the fuck up, Wilson, I’ll be right b—” his deep voice boomed over the thump of the music as he turned to face me, nearly knocking me over with his force.

He froze when he saw me, recognition flashing through his piercing green eyes. It was Talon Nash, my brother’s best friend. His hand still hovered on the doorknob as he took in my appearance - the bruises marring my skin, the tangled mess of my hair, and the worn-out pajamas that barely covered me. Heat rushed to my cheeks as his gaze moved slowly down my body, cataloguing every detail with a mix of concern and surprise.

“Holy shit,” he muttered, his brow furrowing. “Laura?”

I nodded, suddenly feeling very small and vulnerable. “I… I need to see Jake,” I managed to whisper, my voice cracking.

Talon’s expression shifted from surprise to concern. Without a word, he gently placed a hand on my shoulder and guided me inside. The warmth of the house enveloped me, along with the smell of beer and cigarettes. The party was in full swing, with people crowded into every corner of the living room.

“Wilson!” he bellowed over the noise and glanced at a girl with black hair and tattoos who was sitting by the sound system. “Becky, turn down the fuckin music. Where’s Prez?”

Summoned by Talon’s booming voice, Jake emerged from the kitchen, a beer bottle in hand and a confused expression on his face.

“What the fuck, Nash, I thought you were going outsi—” His eyes widened as they landed on me, and the bottle slipped from his hand, shattering on the hardwood floor.

“Laura?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the music.

The room fell silent as everyone turned to stare at us. I felt my cheeks burn once more with embarrassment, all too aware of how I must look to all these strangers. Jake pushed his way through the crowd, his eyes never leaving my face. 

“What the hell happened to you?” he demanded, his voice a mixture of concern and anger.

I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead, I felt hot tears start to roll down my cheeks. Jake’s expression softened, and without hesitation, he pulled me into a rough embrace. I sobbed into his chest, letting the enormous weight of the evening fall from my shoulders.

We stood like that for a few minutes before he moved and held me back at arm’s length to look me over.

“Craig did this to you, didn’t he… I never fuckin liked that guy.”

I nodded weakly, unable to meet Jake’s eyes. The shame I felt was overwhelming, but a small part of me was relieved to finally admit the truth.

Jake’s face hardened, his jaw clenching as he processed my silent confirmation. “I’ll kill him,” he growled, his hands balling into fists at his sides.",1,1746700215.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1khmpvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khmpvb,$KENDU- Redefining what a memecoin should be!,"Memecoins used to be a fun and unique side of the crypto industry. Coins that barely or didn’t have any utility, coins that were created for or by a meme and rode their humorous aspect all the way to the stars. 

Unfortunately memecoins have turned into something dark. Coins created with one reason only, to make a quick buck over someone else’s back. 
From the obvious rug pulls to honeypot’s and every other scam in between. To the coins that aren’t direct scams but use techniques like market manipulation to lure new investors in, only to dump on them and take their money. On top of that stories of traders making millions lures new investors in.
Memecoins have turned into a sea of gambles, where it’s almost impossible to win. Most of the time you’re better off going to the casino. A far stretch from what they were once meant to be. They have always been a risk investment (obviously), just not one where you couldn’t win.

Fortunately every once in a while in that sea of gambles an actual project surfaces. One that isn’t build just to screw people over. One that has grown into a community which doesn’t sit on its ass and hopes for a pump, but a community that works harder and harder everyday to make sure the project succeeds. 
We’ve seen before that coins with communities come out on top, even when people doubt them at first. Look at the giants, $Doge, $Shib or $Pepe for that matter.

$KENDU is taking it one step further, aside from being a coin with one of the chillest and most active communities around, $KENDU is establishing itself into a brand! Where creativity and hard work is not only appreciated, it’s encouraged.
What makes $KENDU different is its not only active on the socials, although we have a massive presence to be proud of! We are actively building IRL!
From Kendu energy drinks, Kendu coffee, Kendu beer. To sponsoring the Miami groves music festival! What this community has already achieved is nothing short of amazing!
All that is happening at a Mc of only $11m
Imagine the possibilities when we’re at way higher levels! It’s hard not to be excited about $KENDU!

I’m not here to beg you to pretty please buy our a bag of our coins. There are enough projects doing just that. 
We are different! I’m writing this to show you that you don’t have to gamble money away, to show you that there are still projects to believe in! 

Check out out subreddit, our website and especially our Telegram. Lurk around for a bit or a while, feel it out for yourself. Then decide if you want in! 
We’re excited to have you join the pack!
Although we encourage work we aren’t forcing anybody to do anything. You’re welcome to just chill if that’s what you like!

We don’t gamble, we work! $KENDU

Wotan had a lot of time to think.

Slow weeks had turned into slow months, and slow months had turned into slow centuries, with very few things to put a smirk on her face, let alone an actual smile. When she wasn’t dealing with the odd fae or demon, she was cooped up in what she had recently lovingly coined ‘Reality’s Armpit’ - a cave comprised almost entirely of reddish stalagmites and stalactites, jutting out above and below her like the maw of some great beast, containing very little more than a desk and a single chair. The irony of a verdant woman living in a sanguine cave was not lost on her.

But her perpetual state of boredom had its perks. For example, she had been blessed with enough time to wrestle with her long-running ruminations on the state of Chaos and Order. She - as with many others in similar predicaments to herself - had long felt on the backfoot of the Lords of Order. For a system that claimed to thrive on the balance of both parties, it was hard not to feel as though those who followed Order simply seemed to win more than those subscribed to Chaos did. Wotan needed only to think of herself to get a good picture of situation; she had died and been reincarnated into countless bodies, all of them the same sickening shade of green, while Nabu sat high and mighty surrounded by resources and staff that Wotan could only dream of having.

It seemed to her that the universe, the Lords, whoever, had created these systems for the benefit of themselves - created these labels to fit themselves into and these hoops for themselves to jump through - just to ignore them anyway. What good was it for Lords of Chaos and Order alike to preach about the importance of balance if the Lords of Order always triumphed? What good was it for the two groups of Lords to devote themselves to destroying the other, only to dither if it meant stepping outside of their boxes?

The system was beyond broken. It was irreparable.

Wotan swung her legs forwards and rose to her feet. No, it was not good enough. For years she had been throwing things at the wall and praying that they’d stick. Three years ago, she had decided that enough was enough, and had embarked out to meet with Khalid and Inza, two Agents of Order, sworn to her own enemy Wotan. Three years ago, she had approached them with a proposal - an offer to save the woman’s husband, a man named Kent Nelson, from Nabu’s clutches. And three years later, she had another proposal for them.

“Khalid? Are you going to come get your dinner?” The young man’s aunt called from the kitchen. His eyes were transfixed on the TV screen in front of him, watching the men and women twirl around each other as they belted out jaunty showtunes.

“Yeah, one moment,” he replied. Khalid rose from his seat and stretched, a deep ache echoing through his spine as he did. Sauntering into the kitchen, the smell of roasted peppers, garlic and warm pitta welcomed him. With a deep breath, he retrieved the plate from Inza’s hand. “Thank you.”

“What’re you watching?” Inza collected her own plate from the countertop before following Khalid back into the living room.

“Just this really old musical,” came the reply. The young man took a hefty bite and, muffled by a mouthful of food, added: “I think it’s called ‘Hello Dolly!’”

“Ugh,” Inza groaned. She lowered herself onto the couch.

“What? Don’t like it?”

“No, I love it.”

The duo settled onto opposite sides of the couch and held their plates firmly, ready to eat. The silence in the room was deafening for a moment. As Inza looked up at the TV screen, the picture frozen on a frame of an elegant-looking woman smiling at a similarly dapper-looking man. “Well, hit play.”

Khalid only stared ahead in silence.

“Khalid?”

“I didn’t pause it.”

Inza opened her mouth to speak, but before any words could form in her mouth, a different, all too familiar, voice sounded out first - “Hello.”

Both Inza and Khalid leapt from their seats, plates still in hand. As they turned towards the source of the noise, a familiar green-skinned woman looked back at them. The same sly smile was plastered on her face, just as it had been years ago. “Wotan,” Inza spat. “I thought we’d finally gotten rid of you.”

Wotan’s mouth dropped open, and she clasped a hand over her chest. “After everything we’ve been through? Oh, Inza, you know just how to hurt me!”

“Oh, what is it now, Chaos demon?” Khalid barked impatiently. “Here to show us another vision of the past to haunt us once more?”

“Believe me, young doctor,” Wotan shook her head. “There are many visions of the past I could show you, and the vast majority of them would haunt you, yes. But today I present to you something far greater, far more haunting than a vision of the past.”

Khalid and Inza both paused, waiting.

“I’m here to discuss the goings on of the present.”

Inza shook her head. “If this is regarding the proposition you gave us years ago—”

“I’m getting to that, dear,” Wotan promised. She tutted. “How quick you are to forget the injustices I informed you of. How soon you remember the person effect - the *torture* of knowing - and how soon you will admit you would rather have lived in the blissful ignorance you had thrived in until then.”

“You put words in our mouths,” Khalid said. “We know what we agreed to - what we discussed - those years ago. We have… well, it feels as though I’ve lived a whole life since then. So, approach this as if you are explaining it to fresh ears.”

Wotan’s grin grew wider. “As you wish, doctor.” She cracked her knuckles, the sound like thunder. “The Lords of Order and the Lords of Chaos are both…” She waved her hands for a second, searching for the right word before landing on, “...shit. The systems they currently operate on were designed to benefit everyone, in a way. But not only do they not benefit any of the common people, demons, fae, so on - they also don’t even benefit the Lords themselves.” She gestured to the two people standing in front of her. “And their Agents.”

“How so?” Inza asked, inquisitive.

“They’re scared,” Wotan shrugged. “So comfy in the bed they’ve made for themselves that they don’t wanna get out of it, even if it means destroying their sworn enemies.” Wotan began to pace the room, tracing a long slender finger over the coffee table as she passed it and flicking away the small gathering of dust that became attached to her finger. “You’ve got both sets of Lords too busy trying to *look* like they’re doing something, and not focusing on *actually* doing something. And don’t even get me started on these rogue agents floating around, acting reckless, harming in the spirit of helping. That’s almost worse.”

“And on top of all that,” Khalid interjected. “You have Lords like Nabu, willing to enslave those who don’t submit to his whim.”

“Bingo.”

Inza shook her head. “I’m… unsure how we come into this.”

“Eager beaver,” Wotan teased with a wag of her finger. “These high-and-mighty overlords aren’t doing their jobs right. They’ve been sitting comfortably for far too long. Clearly, it’s time for a change-up in leadership.”

“A change-up?” Khalid folded his arms.

“A deposition. An expulsion.” Wotan held out her arms, a kind of half-shrug. “A defenestration. Point being, step one is to remove the sitting ducks from the head of the table.”

A hush fell over the room as Khalid and Inza processed the weight of Wotan’s words. The green-skinned woman clasped her hands behind her back. It was difficult for her to hide the look of pride on her face, and so she made no attempt to. After a moment more of hesitation, Wotan tilted her head. “Are you in so far?”

Inza pursed her lips. Then, with an intense stare, she began. “What I’ve learnt about Nabu - what you’ve shown me - is… deplorable. How can we call what he gleefully does ‘order’, in any sense of the word?” She broke her stare with Wotan, looking instead at Khalid. “As much as it pains me to admit, there is something deeply flawed with the current system. Something has to give.”

“I’m with you, Inza,” Khalid said, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

“So, is that a yes?” Wotan grinned.

As Inza opened her mouth to speak, she felt a strange sensation clouding her brain. All at once, it felt as if a weight had been lifted from her, and as if a fog had descended across her mind. She lurched forwards and clutched at her head. Then, as quickly as it started, the feeling subsided.

“Woah,” Wotan commented. “I gotta say, it takes a lot to surprise me, given my day job. But that was… what was that?”

Inza looked down at her hands. In lieu of the weight she had not realised she was carrying until it was gone, an odd tingle took its place, a kind of pins and needles over her entire body. As she blinked, she came to a realisation. “Nabu,” she said. “He’s…”

“My connection to him is severed,” Khalid added. “Inza, yours too?”

Inza could only nod.

“What’d I tell you?” Wotan shook her head. “You’ve proven yourselves to be no longer of use to him, so he’s thrown you out.” The woman bit the inside of her cheek; her anger was palpable. “I suppose you’re lucky he didn’t immediately turn you both into guard dogs or something.”

“You told us that if you freed us of our bonds to Nabu, that it would only be a matter of time before that space was filled up again,” Khalid recalled.

Wotan collapsed into the centre of the couch. “My, your memory is better than I gave you credit for.”

“Who’s to say the space isn’t already filled?”

Wotan shrugged. “Who’s to say, indeed.”

“And who’s to say,” Inza realised, her body language stiff - tense. “They aren’t already on their way? To, as you say, turn us into guard dogs?”

Wotan, after a pause, shrugged again. “Who’s to say, indeed,” she repeated.

“What are we going to do?” Khalid asked. Urgency and panic washed over him. “We can’t just storm up to Nabu ourselves, just us three. That’s suicide.”

“Ah, well, here’s the fun part.” Wotan leaned in close to Inza and Khalid. A wild grin played on her lips. “You remember those rogue agents I was talking about?”

Traci had barely had time to think.

Between monster-slaying in the Shadowlands and cleaning up various liquids that had been spilled and spewed across the floor of the Oblivion Bar, there was hardly a time to sit, let alone rest. And, if she had to admit it, that was the way she liked it. Shoving her way through the crowd, Traci delivered a pint of steaming orange liquid to one of her beloved patrons, collecting their money with her other hand before disappearing once more behind the bar.

“Jim,” she called out to the former Nightmaster at the far end of the bar. “Another pint of the same.”

“Sure,” came the response. “Who for? I’ll take it out to them.”

“Me.”

Jim shot her a glance. Then, realising she was serious, he nodded to himself and poured the drink. The liquid sputtered and fizzed as if it were alive, and as he slid the glass down the bar, the swiftly forming condensation guided it along its journey until it arrived safely in Traci’s hands.

As soon as Traci raised the glass to her lips, before the drink could even pass her teeth, she heard the door to the Oblivion Bar slam open.

Lowering the glass, Traci could make out three people barrelling into the room. As if rehearsed, the crowd split to allow the strangers to approach the bar. Two of the group looked relatively ordinary - tan skin, dark hair - but the third was unusual; bright green skin was complemented by stark black hair, both of which shone in the warm lighting of the bar. Upon a second look, it struck Traci that the other two, in fact, were familiar to her.

“Traci,” Inza said. Recognition sparkled in her eyes.

Out of the corner of her eye, Traci could see her other four compatriots - Jim, Ruin, Rory, and Sherry - gathering, as if they had been summoned. “Inza.”

“Thank God you’re here,” the woman sighed. “We’re in desperate need of your help.”
