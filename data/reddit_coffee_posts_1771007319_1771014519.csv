Chapter 1: OLIVE’s POV

I had three client presentations due tomorrow and a marketing strategy that was nowhere near finished, but all I could think about was Cole coming home in two weeks.

It had been two months since I’d seen him in person. Two months of video calls and texts that came later and later each night.

Grayson would tell me I was overthinking again. My stepfather had been the steady one since Mom remarried ten years ago—the kind of dad who actually showed up, who remembered what mattered.

I pulled my laptop onto the bed, staring at the half-finished campaign for Hopkins Company.

Pathetic.

I shoved the laptop aside and reached for my nightstand drawer.

The feeling of having my vibe pressed right where I needed it, imagining Cole in his blue practice jersey, hair slicked back, hands braced on the headboard above me…

Close. So close.

The door slammed open.

My mother stood in the doorway like she hadn’t just walked in on something she definitely shouldn’t have seen. When I scrambled to sit up, tangled in my sheets and trying to shove the vibe under my pillow, she smiled.

Actually smiled.

“Oh darling, I’m so sorry I interrupted. But playtime’s over.”

“God, Mom, knocking is a thing adults do.” My face was on fire. I shoved the vibe into my nightstand drawer so fast I almost broke my finger.

“Your door was wide open, Olive. Be grateful it was me and not Hunter.”

God, if my stepbrother had walked in on that I’d have to move to another state.

“Mom, stop. Please just stop talking.”

She pressed her lips together, but amusement danced in her eyes. I wanted to die right there.

Living in the renovated space above the garage was supposed to give me independence, but it didn’t stop my mother from barging in whenever she felt like it. Still, it beat paying two grand a month for some shoebox apartment in Seattle.

“We need to talk to you.” Her voice changed, got serious. “Grayson and I have some exciting news.”

Exciting news in this family usually meant something that benefited everyone except me.

“Olive Monroe, I want you downstairs in five minutes or I’m dragging you out of that bed myself.”

The second the door closed I grabbed my phone. I needed to hear Cole’s voice, needed something good to balance out whatever disaster my parents were about to drop on me.

I hit his contact. One ring. Two rings. Three.

Cole always answered. Always picked up when I called.

The screen flickered—video call accepted—and suddenly I was staring at a shaking camera propped up on something, angled weird.

I could see him.

Cole.

Not alone.

“Oh god, yes—Cole, right there—”

A woman’s voice hit me first, high-pitched and breathless. For a second my brain couldn’t process what I was seeing.

Cole on his back, head thrown against the pillow, mouth open as he groaned. A girl on top of him, blonde hair spilling down her back as she moved.

“Fuck, you feel so good—”

“Sophia—Christ, Sophia—”

His name for her. The way he said it like it was something precious. The phone jolted with every thrust.

I should’ve hung up.

Should’ve thrown my phone across the room and pretended I’d never seen this, never heard this.

I just sat there like an idiot. Frozen. Watching my boyfriend of two years moan another woman’s name.

“God, I’m close—Cole, I’m so close—”

His hands gripped her hips and pulled her down harder. That deep groan I thought he only made with me—

The phone slipped from my fingers.

It clattered onto my bed face-up. I could still hear them—the wet sounds, her moans, his name in her mouth over and over.

Two years.

Two years of standing in freezing arenas watching him play. Two years of driving three hours just to see him for a weekend. Two years of wearing his jersey like any of it mattered.

The entire time he’d been with someone else.

Someone named Sophia.

I grabbed the phone and stabbed at the screen until the call ended. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hit the right button.

Don’t cry. Don’t you dare cry over him.

But my throat was tight and my eyes were burning and I hated that I could still hear her voice in my head.

I pressed my palms against my eyes hard enough that it hurt.

He wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth a single tear, wasn’t worth the two years I’d given him or any of it.

But my face was already wet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I didn’t bother fixing my hair or washing my face before heading downstairs. What was the point.

The main house smelled like coffee and whatever my mom had baked earlier that week.

The second I opened the door both my parents’ heads snapped toward me.

“I was about to come drag you out of—” Mom stopped mid-sentence. “Olive, what’s wrong?”

I tried to say something, anything, but the second she asked, it was like a dam broke inside my chest.

I sobbed, ugly and gasping.

Grayson was already moving. He crossed the room in two strides and pulled me against his chest, one hand going to my hair and the other to my back, holding me while I fell apart.

“Shh, hey, it’s okay, you’re okay.”

“I caught him cheating.” My voice sounded wrecked.

Silence.

Complete silence.

I watched Mom’s mouth fall open. Watched Grayson’s jaw get tight.

“That Buffalo pretty boy with the perfect hair?” Mom’s voice came out sharp now. Angry.

“Diane,” Grayson warned.

“You deserve better than him, Olive. You always have.”

I wanted to believe him. Right now all I could think about was Cole’s face, about the way he’d looked at me the last time and said I love you right before asking if I could pick up his dry cleaning.

“We actually had something we wanted to tell you.” Mom’s voice softened. “Hunter got the call. He’s officially playing for the Chicago Wolves.”

My stomach dropped. “He got called up?”

The promise I’d made eight months ago, ‘when you make the NHL, I’ll be front row at your first game’ crashed into the reality of Cole’s face, Cole’s team, Cole’s city.

Hunter had been there for me through everything. Every breakup, every bad day, every moment I needed someone who understood what it felt like to be the spare part in someone else’s story.

“The game is next week,” Grayson added quietly. “I know the timing is complicated.”

“Cole is on that team.” My voice cracked. “I can’t—I can’t see him right now.”

“Then don’t look at him,” Mom said sharply. “You made a promise to your brother.”

Guilt twisted in my chest because she was right. I had promised. Back when it seemed like a far-off dream, something sweet and hypothetical, we’d joked about over pizza and bad movies.

Now it was real and the timing couldn’t be worse.

“We have tickets to his first game. Exclusive access—”

“I don’t know if I can do this.”

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. “Hunter would understand if you couldn’t make it. But he really wants you there, sweetheart.”

Mom grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and dropped it into my lap. “That’s your brother right there. Front page of Sports Illustrated.”

I looked down at Hunter’s face staring back at me.

The headline read NEW BLOOD: The Wolves’ Secret Weapon.

Pride swelled in my chest despite everything. He’d worked so hard for this.

I flipped to the next page, trying to focus on anything other than the thought of seeing Cole again.

What I saw made my entire body go still.

An ad for some energy drink. But I barely registered what the product was.

The man in the photo had his shirt half-unbuttoned. Abs so defined they didn’t even look real. The energy drink tipped against his mouth, liquid spilling over his bottom lip, dripping down his jaw and his throat.

His eyes were piercing. Cold blue. Staring directly at the camera like he could see through the page.

Like he could see me.

My thighs clenched.

“Olive?”

Grayson’s voice snapped me back. I’d been staring at the photo for way too long.

“Yeah, sorry, I just—” I cleared my throat. “Who’s this guy?”

Grayson’s entire expression changed. Got dark and tight. He gripped his coffee mug hard enough I thought it might crack.

“Zane Mercer.”

The way he said the name made it sound like it physically hurt him.

“Who?”

“My nemesis.” His voice was completely flat.

“Your nemesis? What are you, a supervillain?”

“He’s the NHL’s top player,” Mom said, her voice careful now. “And he’s made Grayson’s life hell since he started coaching. That man did things that forced him to leave the game entirely.”

I’d heard stories over the years. Vague references about someone who’d ruined everything, someone powerful and untouchable who’d destroyed his coaching career. But I’d never heard an actual name.

Zane Mercer.

Top player for the Chicago Wolves.

And apparently the last person Grayson wanted me thinking about.

I stared at the photo again. At those cold blue eyes, that dangerous jaw, the body that looked like it had been carved from stone.

At least if I had to spend a week in Chicago watching my ex-boyfriend pretend I didn’t exist, there’d be something worth looking at.

I closed the magazine and stood up, tucking it under my arm before either of them could take it back.

“Fine. I’ll go to Chicago.”

Mom blinked at me. “Really?”

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

“Besides,” I added, trying to be casual even though my heart was racing, “maybe watching some hockey will help me move on.” ",1,1771014381.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

# System Specifications

**Operating System**  
Windows 11 Pro 64-bit

**CPU**  
Intel Core i9-9900K @ 3.60GHz (Coffee Lake, 14nm)

**RAM**  
32GB DDR4 (XMP tested both enabled and disabled)

**Motherboard**  
Gigabyte Z390 AORUS MASTER

**GPU**  
ASUS NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti (11GB)  
Idle temperature around 36°C

**Monitors**  
2x Dell AW2720HF – 1920x1080 @ 240Hz

**Storage**  
480GB WD SSD  
2TB WD HDD

**PSU**  
950W



# The Issue

While playing the following games:

* Rust
* Predecessor
* Farming Simulator 22

I experience:

* In-game freeze
* “Engine not responding” message
* Sometimes a black screen
* “GPU Crash dump Triggered”
* Windows Event Viewer shows **nvlddmkm** errors
* I also saw: “File system filter 'EasyAntiCheat\_EOSSys' has been unloaded from memory.”



# Important Details

* GPU runs completely stable in benchmarks (no crashes).
* No crashes during normal Windows usage.
* Temperatures are normal.
* Crashes only happen while gaming.



# What I’ve Tried

* Full clean driver reinstall using DDU
* Tested multiple NVIDIA driver versions
* Removed GeForce Experience
* Disabled XMP
* No overclock active
* Tested different power management settings
* Fully removed and reinstalled Easy Anti-Cheat
* Cleared shader cache
* Tested FPS limiting
* Benchmarks run stable without issues



# Question

Since benchmarks are stable but games crash, could this be:

* A TDR timeout issue?
* Power spike instability?
* Early GPU degradation?
* Unreal Engine-related instability?
* PSU transient issue?

Time of the month, amount of sleep, time of day you take them, ect. I'm a big breakfast person and I feel like I've noticed my meds feel more effective depending on what I eat and I'm not sure if it's mostly a placebo or there's something to it?

When I first got on meds I was reading up about what foods to avoid while taking them (rip kimchi for breakfast, my beloved 😭) and what foods would help them out. I read protien-rich meals are good, whereas sugary carbs may not be as good for how quickly meds will kick in/how long they'll last. Delaying your coffee can help, avoiding citrus, all that stuff.

Do you feel like you have a good everyday breakfast that works with your meds and helps you out? For me the best thing I've found is a Wawa sausage burrito with avocado and a 24oz coffee, it's my fave fast food breakfast and I feel great after eating it on days when I need to take meds to get a lot done, but I can't exactly eat that every day lol.

I wanted to believe him. Right now all I could think about was Cole’s face, about the way he’d looked at me the last time and said I love you right before asking if I could pick up his dry cleaning.

“We actually had something we wanted to tell you.” Mom’s voice softened. “Hunter got the call. He’s officially playing for the Chicago Wolves.”

My stomach dropped. “He got called up?”

The promise I’d made eight months ago, ‘when you make the NHL, I’ll be front row at your first game’ crashed into the reality of Cole’s face, Cole’s team, Cole’s city.

Hunter had been there for me through everything. Every breakup, every bad day, every moment I needed someone who understood what it felt like to be the spare part in someone else’s story.

“The game is next week,” Grayson added quietly. “I know the timing is complicated.”

“Cole is on that team.” My voice cracked. “I can’t—I can’t see him right now.”

“Then don’t look at him,” Mom said sharply. “You made a promise to your brother.”

Guilt twisted in my chest because she was right. I had promised. Back when it seemed like a far-off dream, something sweet and hypothetical, we’d joked about over pizza and bad movies.

Now it was real and the timing couldn’t be worse.

“We have tickets to his first game. Exclusive access—”

“I don’t know if I can do this.”

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. “Hunter would understand if you couldn’t make it. But he really wants you there, sweetheart.”

Mom grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and dropped it into my lap. “That’s your brother right there. Front page of Sports Illustrated.”

I looked down at Hunter’s face staring back at me.

The headline read NEW BLOOD: The Wolves’ Secret Weapon.

Pride swelled in my chest despite everything. He’d worked so hard for this.

I flipped to the next page, trying to focus on anything other than the thought of seeing Cole again.

What I saw made my entire body go still.

An ad for some energy drink. But I barely registered what the product was.

The man in the photo had his shirt half-unbuttoned. Abs so defined they didn’t even look real. The energy drink tipped against his mouth, liquid spilling over his bottom lip, dripping down his jaw and his throat.

His eyes were piercing. Cold blue. Staring directly at the camera like he could see through the page.

Like he could see me.

My thighs clenched.

“Olive?”

Grayson’s voice snapped me back. I’d been staring at the photo for way too long.

“Yeah, sorry, I just—” I cleared my throat. “Who’s this guy?”

Grayson’s entire expression changed. Got dark and tight. He gripped his coffee mug hard enough I thought it might crack.

“Zane Mercer.”

The way he said the name made it sound like it physically hurt him.

“Who?”

“My nemesis.” His voice was completely flat.

“Your nemesis? What are you, a supervillain?”

“He’s the NHL’s top player,” Mom said, her voice careful now. “And he’s made Grayson’s life hell since he started coaching. That man did things that forced him to leave the game entirely.”

I’d heard stories over the years. Vague references about someone who’d ruined everything, someone powerful and untouchable who’d destroyed his coaching career. But I’d never heard an actual name.

Zane Mercer.

Top player for the Chicago Wolves.

And apparently the last person Grayson wanted me thinking about.

I stared at the photo again. At those cold blue eyes, that dangerous jaw, the body that looked like it had been carved from stone.

At least if I had to spend a week in Chicago watching my ex-boyfriend pretend I didn’t exist, there’d be something worth looking at.

I closed the magazine and stood up, tucking it under my arm before either of them could take it back.

“Fine. I’ll go to Chicago.”

Mom blinked at me. “Really?”

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

“Besides,” I added, trying to be casual even though my heart was racing, “maybe watching some hockey will help me move on.”",1,1771014367.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

There were still people who talked of a time when it never snowed in San Francisco, but Pav was sixteen now, and he had never known anything else. The sun wouldn’t shine on the capital of this state for another few hours, but the city was awake and ready to fuel the republic.



“Today, I take on the fourth SF Suicide Slide challenge!” 



Pav talked to his phone in his usual daily livestream. His last stream had reached a whopping eleven viewers as he recklessly sledded down Clipper Street. There were only three simple rules to take on one of the ten SF Suicide Slides, which was good for a simple guy like Pav:

1. All challenges must be done between the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. This rule was “for the safety of the slider,” but also to make sure there were actual vehicles on the road. It was easy to weave through Waymos—which were programmed to slam on their brakes if a daredevil clout-chaser came sledding anywhere near them—if you went out at 2:00 A.M. Private security started their shifts around five, and they were legally allowed to take potshots at anyone they “deemed a threat” to the business they guarded. They didn’t have much to do but stand there and look intimidating, so any excuse to fire their weapons at live targets was enough for them.
2. You had to use a plastic trash can lid as a sled. Those big rectangular ones that you would wheel out to the side of the road before trash day. Pop one of the lids off and you were good to go. The reason for this stipulation was lost to time, but the general consensus was that “The First” had done all ten slides like that, so everyone else had to, too.
3. All attempts must be livestreamed with two or more angles. For Pav, this meant his iPhone 22—about ten models outdated—and a GoPro strapped to his head. People loved to use AI to fake internet challenges, so any video that didn’t feature at least two angles was automatically out.



“As you all know, you start at ‘Emperor Hotel’ and end at ‘One Market Plaza.’”



The initial incline was fairly steep, but once you passed Montgomery Street, it would even out into a nice ride to the finish. It was a straight shot to the bottom, meaning it was relatively straightforward. The real trick to this one was timing and momentum.



“It’s 6:02 A.M. here in the snowy City. How are y’all doin’ this fine morning?!”



‘Do a flip’ ‘yer gonna die this time, kid’ ‘KYS rebel scum’



Encouraging stuff, but all views were good views as Pav waited for the streetlights to align. Pav did a bump of ‘King’—a type of coke usually reserved for artist types and writers who needed to crank out content faster than AI could—which he acquired just for the occasion.



“It’s three thousand, six hundred, and ninety-six feet with eleven cross streets, boys. No problem!”



The red streetlights marked his path through the gloomy fog. The Mason Street lights went red, the California lights turned green, and he was off with a quick jump onto his scuffed sled. The flag of the California Republic flew twenty stories high to his right on the InterContinental housing structure. The massive refuge dwarfed the five-story ‘Emperor Hotel’—now the unofficial APEX HQ—that Pav passed on his left.



‘Cringe jump’ ‘POG’



The chat started to spell something out as Pav rapidly picked up speed. 



‘N’



This initial part was the steepest, so it was all he could do to hold his phone out and “steer.” The empty, timid, autonomous boxcars honked and came to a sliding stop as he skidded past. 



‘I’



Massive apartment complexes, once catering to the wealthy denizens of the city, blocked the skyline on Pav’s left. On his right were the “boutiques” that once catered to well-off professionals, but were now resource-rich “whatever you need” markets. Stanford Court, one of many former hotels down California Street, had similarly been converted from a ritzy hotel to crowded refugee housing. 



‘C’



Powell, Stockton, and Grant Street all turned red as the green lights of the 10-degree sloped street turned on. Each light change greeted him with the promise of relative safety as he whizzed past. The chat was arguing about something, but Pav had to grip with both hands as he bounced furiously down toward Stockton. The Ritz-Carlton marked the last of the hotel conversions before hitting Chinatown. 



‘E’



Grant Street cut through Chinatown, whose streets were packed to the brim with refugees from the ""mystical east."" The corner store sold all manner of “psychic services”—tarot, palm reading, and other fortune-telling—and was painted with a mural depicting the Statue of Liberty with her trademark third eye and golden Chinese dragons surrounding her. 



‘NICE!’



Montgomery Street was fast approaching—an incredibly busy West Coast Wall Street with fat cats getting to work to keep the little republic’s economy running. Two cars, each turning onto Montgomery from the center lane, provided Pav’s first danger. He slid all the way to the right, splashing pedestrians with slush, in order to dodge the incoming vehicles. Honks and rude gestures bade him farewell as he crossed the cluttered threshold.



‘Kinda sick’ ‘gay’ ‘POGGERS!’



He managed a brief look at the chat while cleanly approaching the Sansome intersection. 26 viewers! The maneuvering through Montgomery had killed a lot of his momentum, but he only had to clear four more intersections. Green lights all the way down as he skidded slowly through Battery.



“How we doin’ chat?!” Pav yelled through chattering teeth, hoping to engage this new gaggle of viewership.



‘Doin yr mom LOL’ ‘chatisscrollingsofastnoonewillseeim’



Red light. Red light. Red light. He hadn’t maintained enough speed to stay on cycle. Cross-traffic started moving as he limped past Front Street. Self-driving rectangles honked soullessly as their passengers obliviously scrolled through their phones. Pav jammed his own phone into his pocket as he desperately paddled himself forward on his hands and knees.

A muffled text-to-speech message issued from his pocket as the ground flattened beneath him. 



“GrimeGuy420 donates one dollar and says ‘MIKE HAWK’”



He yanked his phone out as he drifted toward the final intersection. 



“Thanks for the dono! I dedicate this final bit of my slide to My—”



Pav came to a stop in the middle of Drumm and California as he unceremoniously plowed into a snow pile. The twenty-story monstrosity that was the Hyatt Regency loomed as a marker of failure. No truck horn, no screech of tires; Pav’s head just slammed the pavement as a Cybertruck scraped him along the ground. The bones in his arms snapped loudly; the dual cameras crunched against the asphalt. The shattered screen showed Pav one last glimpse of the chat before pain brought absolute darkness.



‘Holy shit’ ‘LOL’ ‘OWNED’









Fluorescent lights illuminating bleached ceilings gave Pav a shaky greeting as he opened his eyes. His mummified arms stuck out in front of him, resting in slings that sprouted from the sides of his hospital bed. His field of view was equally locked into place, a massive brace keeping his torso from moving. Steady beeps, frantic yet authoritative voices, hurried footsteps. Sounds felt muffled, but each came with a small wave of pain that gleefully roiled across Pav’s body. A young doctor with the slightest tinge of a Cajun accent stood to Pav’s left as he parted the curtain.



“Mister... Pav?”



“Doc” had one of those long, highfalutin French names that Pav couldn’t really pronounce, let alone spell. Doc gave a rundown befitting Pav’s intelligence.



“The list of broken bones and damaged internal organs is too long for me to bother with. You were hit by a car, but we’re going to have you patched up right quick as soon as we figure out your insurance situation.”



“Mphh dfft fav fnshrens.”



“I’m afraid your jaw is wired shut, but we already know you don’t have your own insurance. Fortunately, APEX has an insurance program for emancipated minors such as yourself.”



“Dh ght hntrs?”



“If you could just look into my workpad here, Mr. Pav. Blink twice if you agree.”



As far as Pav was aware, APEX was a ghost-hunting agency associated with the Californian government. Why they would be funding random people’s medical procedures was beyond him, but he also didn’t have any money. Pav blinked twice without reading the agreement—not that he could if he had wanted to.



Over the next couple of days, Pav was pulled into surgery a dozen or so times. Doc’s promise to “patch him up right quick” had not been hyperbole. Pav’s twisted arms were untwisted, his insides put in order, and his jaw unwired. He was put into the rest and observation phase of his recovery before the week was out. While two days of free surgery, ample pain medication, and being able to walk and talk again should have been the best part of Pav’s hospital journey, it wasn’t. Pav got something else, something he hadn’t expected; a friend. All that separated the two lads was a thin, cloth divider.



The new friend spoke with a slight lisp.



“So, what are you in for?”



Pav couldn’t see what he looked like, but he answered anyway.



“I was doing an internet challenge and got hit by a truck.”



“And now you’ve woken up in another world with magic powers?”



“I… uhh… what? No, I woke up in the hospital.”



He let out a dramatic sigh, the reference shooting over Pav’s head. When he didn’t speak again right away Pav pressed further.



“How about you? What are you in for?”



“I hit some kid with my truck and hit my head on the steering wheel.”



“Wait, what?”



“Hahaha, relax kid, I’m fucking with you. I’ve got a wicked fungal infection and I’m here to get excess fluids drained before they cut that shit out of my body.”



“Oh, gnarly.”



“Yeah bro, you want some of my fungus fluid? I bet it tastes like Mountain Dew.”



“Should I be worried about contracting your infection?”



“Hey bro, did you know there are trillions of micro-organisms all over your skin?”



“Is that part of your fungal infection? Wait, what was that about Mountain Dew?”



“Of course not! I said YOUR skin. Everyone’s skin. Yeah if I squeeze my leg hard enough it leaks a yellow fluid. Like piss! Or Mountain Dew. It’s my Luca Dew.”



“I’m lost.”



“Hi Lost, I’m Dad, but you can call me Luca.”



Luca was a yapper. It took Pav a few hours of Luca yapping in circles for him to pin down all the facts about his new friend. His name is Luca, and his internet handle is GrimeGuy420. He’s nineteen, three years older than Pav, and he claims to be a warlock. Pav dozed off while Luca blathered loudly in Spanish to an equally loud person on speaker phone. Doc woke Pav up some time later, holding a syringe full of a dark amber substance.



“Mister Pav, I’m pleased to bring you the latest APEX rapid recovery solution. Now that your arms have been set, this should speed up the recovery process.”



“I gotta level with you, Doc, all these pain drugs you got me on got me feeling high as fuck.”



Doc raised one of his thin, grey eyebrows while preparing Pav’s arm for the injection.



“Boy, I haven’t given you any pain medications. Please refrain from taking any illicit substances during your stay at the hospital.”



Doc’s eyebrow remained arched as he pulled the various tubes out of Pav’s arms. He swabbed the area clean before pushing his needle of mysterious syrup into a slot on Pav’s I.V.



“Just try and stay calm, this will be the only drug you’ll need from now on... if it works. Describe anything you may be seeing... or feeling.”



“Doc? How do you know whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh”



Doc pushed the plunger and the amber shot through Pav’s veins at an alarming speed. The room spun as Pav felt an ice cold, burning sensation wash through his arms. The sensation caused him to spasm wildly, casted arms straining against the suspended braces.



“Subject's injection site displays dark stains in the immediate area of the veins. Next test will be done with casts removed to observe physical results.”



Pav’s vision swam furiously, dark tendrils crawling across his irises before blacking out his vision entirely. Doc’s words became slow and muffled.



“Sssuuubbjeecc–”



*thmp thmp... thmp thmp... thmp*



Pav couldn’t make out the words over the ear-splitting, rhythmic thrumming that now invaded his brain. He felt as if someone was kneading his soul like a wet bread loaf. His lips moved, a rumble in his throat, but he had no idea if he was actually speaking.



*thmp thmp... thmp thmp... thmp*



A slightly lispy voice cut through the pulsing song that threatened to turn Pav’s head into jelly.



“Slider boy? What are you doing here?”



“AH FUCK!”



Pav awoke with a jolt in his hospital bed. Doc was nowhere to be seen, but Pav’s arm casts had been removed. The veins on his pale forearms had been stained black, but they were slowly reverting to their usual pallor.



“Slider boy, why are you yelling?”



Luca had parted the curtain and stuck his head through. A mop of dark black hair, shot through with streaks of blue. Pav had watched a lot of old movies and would describe Luca as having “an Austin Powers turtle mouth”.



“Bro, check it out, you’re a MEME!”



He handed Pav his phone. It was playing a three-second clip of Pav saying “MIKE HAWK” before getting steamrolled by a rusted out cybertruck. Pav noticed



“The general consensus is that you didn’t complete the challenge. You didn’t actually make it to the bottom. On the flip side, you’re gonna be a good meme format!”



Luca left after his drainage procedure, he’d be back next week for the follow-up surgery. Pav felt great, but was told he had to wait as his body healed. Once a day, for the next week, Doc gave him one of those amber injections. The second injection coursed through Pav’s now-exposed arms. The brown amber tainted his veins as it made its way down to his fingertips. He had been strapped down this time to mitigate the thrashing, but it didn’t help the searing pain Pav felt. Once again, the inky blackness swam across his vision. The haunting, overpowering melody began in his head again.



*thmp thmp... thmp thmp... thmp*



It was clearer, less deafening, almost beautiful as it echoed around in Pav’s skull.



*thmp thmp... thmp thmp... thmp*



“Subject’s irises have been fully coated in amber, causing temporary blindness. It appears he can still hear, but is locked in a euphoric state.”



*thmp thmp... thmp thmp... thmp*



A blinding light shot through the darkness, briefly illuminating the area around Pav. He was sliding down a long, dark tunnel that was dripping with a blackened ooze. The roiling tunnel gave off flashes of deep, dark blue wherever the light hit.



“Subject still responds to direct light, despite bliiiiiiiiiiii–”



*THMP THMP... THMP THMP... THMP*



The song of the storming tunnel enveloped Pav fully once again. All other sounds were sharply cut off as Pav lost consciousness. Each night, until the end of Pav’s first week in the hospital, he was given a syringe full of that familiar, thick, golden sludge. Each night Pav lost consciousness in a tunnel of filth—pulsing with an unknown melody—and awoke with a newly healed organ.



“You’re looking better, slider boy.”



Luca stood there, wearing a t-shirt with a cartoon cat hitting a comically large bong.



“Hey, thanks. They’re testing some rapid recovery drug on me.”



He frowned at this, but didn’t interrupt.



“I’m basically good to go, but I figured I’d stick around for your sake.”



“Kinda zesty, bro.



Pav had no idea what that meant, but it sounded positive?



“My surgery is today, and then no more hospital. Sounds like you’ll be out soon, too. What you get out, you should come hit me up in Oakdale.”



Luca had to stay in the hospital for an entire week after his surgery. It was the best week of Pav’s life. Since Luca was bedroom and Pav was effectively healed, he ran around the hospital at Luca’s beck and call–trips to the lobby to use the various vending machines. Luca’s favorite was the one that served hot food with a giant touchscreen. It all came to an end too quickly.



“Smell ya later, slider boy.” was all Pav got as Luca left for the last time. Pav knew what he had to do next: escape.









“Are you ready to leave us, Mr. Pav?” The blonde nurse currently in charge of patient intake flashed Pav a toothy smile. Pav would describe him as “an NPC lookin-ass-guy”.



“Uhh, yeah! All better now!”



He kept the perfect white smile, but his tone shifted an octave lower with each sentence. 

  
“Fantastic. I’ll just need to see your discharge papers from Doctor Ailuva.”

  
“Oh. I don’t have any of those, I think.”

  
“Well then, you’ll just have to go back to your bed until you get those.”

  
“Are you sure I ca–”

  
“No.” He practically growled it at this point.



There were two lightly armed guards at the exit, but Pav decided to test his luck anyway. He sprinted towards the hospital entrance as the double doors slid open. The guards were more prepared than their mall-cop-esque demeanor appeared. Four separate barbed cords came shooting towards Pav, puncturing his flesh before losing two tasers' worth of electricity into him.

An amber-colored fluid began to leak from Pav’s face as he stood his ground against the lightning coursing through his body. Despite his fortitude, the tasers caused all his muscles to contract and spasm wildly.

  
“M..M..Motherrrrrrr.. F-ff-fff-fuckerrrrr. I-aai-aai-ai-ai...”

  
Pav was able to take a few steps forward before collapsing into a shaking, slightly smoking heap.







  
Pav woke up in the hospital for an eighth time. This time, however, he was in his own room—handcuffed to the bed.

  
“Mister Pav, good morning.”

  
Doc sat in a chair to Pav’s right, a half-eaten chicken sandwich sitting on a table next to him. He wasn’t looking at Pav, just going through his notes as if nothing was amiss.

  
“Oh hey, Doc. I’m feeling a lot better and I think I’m ready to go. Could I get some discharge papers?”

  
“I’m afraid not, Mister Pav. As per your agreement with APEX, you’re here until the testing has concluded. We don’t know what could happen to you once the drug has entirely left your system, so an early discharge is out of the question.”

  
Pav snickered. “Bummer.”

  
“Yes, but fortunately you weren’t injured further by your attempt to leave prematurely. Get some rest, boy; you’ll be out before you know it.”

  
The doctor left Pav still handcuffed to the bed. Pav had no home, no family, and no phone, but that wasn’t going to stop him from escaping the hospital and reuniting with his new friend. What did stop him, however, was the timely start of his withdrawals. The reckless daredevil had put a great number of illicit substances into his body over the course of sixteen years, but never enough to get himself addicted. The heaving and puking was a new experience for him. 



Pav’s wrist snapped against the heavy metal cuff multiple times on that first night. The bones stitched themselves back together almost as fast as he broke them, but each break healed a bit slower than the previous. Every expulsion of bodily fluids came with an equal amount of blackened amber.

After a night of twisting agony, Pav was able to get some modicum of rest. Doc returned as daylight began to creep through the window.



“Now, imagine going through that out in the cold streets. This is why you must stay, boyo, for your own good.”

  
“What the fuck did you put in me?”

  
“Just as you were told: a rapid recovery drug meant for field use. Your testing is invaluable to APEX. The second night won’t be nearly so bad. I’ll even uncuff you for it.”

  
Pav faded in and out of consciousness over the course of the day. Nurses came to clean him up, bagging and cataloging anything he expelled from his body. Neither food nor liquids would stay down, so all his nutrients came from I.V. bags full of clear gel. Doc came to check on him multiple times, noting any changes in Pav’s physiology. Doc even uncuffed him, as promised, but then strapped Pav to the bed in multiple places.

  
“It’s for your own safety, boyo; you’ve been thrashing a lot.”

  
Pav was too exhausted to retort, so he just nodded weakly.

  
“I’m going to give you something for the sleep tonight. In the morning we’ll be reintroducing serum to your body. Rest up, boy.”

  
Pav’s heart began to race. *“They’re gonna put more of that shit in me? Fuck that.”*

Doc took note of Pav’s pulse quickening but jabbed him with a needle all the same. Pav’s eyelids became too heavy to keep open. He was out before his vitals went critical.

The musical thrumming was at its dullest that night. Pav missed hearing it now but was even more terrified at the thought of it ending entirely. The doc’s muffled voice cut through the fog of Pav’s mind. He had gotten used to the sound of the doctor’s verbal note-taking, but this sounded different.



“The boy will surely die if he doesn’t get amber immediately.”



The responses came across more muffled. Pav couldn’t make out what was being said to the doctor, but he could make out two distinct voices.



“I don’t care; you need my research to continue and I won’t let him die.”



Again the muffled voices came; again Pav couldn’t make out the words.



“Yes. Yes, fine. I understand. No more amber. We’ll see what happens.”



Pav awoke the next day feeling worse than he ever had before. He had shriveled so much that he resembled a corpse; his bedheets carried a dark, sweat-stained outline of his withered form. Doc sat sleeping in the chair next to him. His notes were scattered on the floor, but they didn’t tell the barely literate boy much. Pav creaked out a sound, as loud as he could manage, to get the doctor’s attention. Doc was startled into consciousness, deep bags of grief under his eyes.



“Ah, Pav, good morning. How do you feel?”



Pav croaked and gave a weak thumbs-up in response.



“Good. Good. Well, I’m glad to say we won’t be putting any more experimental drugs into you. Just get some rest and you’ll be out as soon as you recover.”



The doc looked into Pav’s near-lifeless eyes. Nobody had ever considered the young man to be particularly bright, but there was an understanding in those eyes that would haunt the doctor for the rest of his days. He couldn’t stand to lie to the boy any further, so he left Pav in the darkened hospital room. Pav couldn’t feel his body anymore. He couldn’t hear the now-nostalgic beat in his ears. Worst of all, he knew he wouldn’t see Luca again.







# Bad Case

Doc wouldn’t go home yet. Not until he fixed his mistakes.

*Click.*

The recording played Doc’s own voice back at him—one last check before sending his confession away.

**Patient Log.** **Subject:** ""Pav."" Surname unknown. 

**Status:** Ward of the state. 

**Timestamp:** 15 July, 2055. 04:04 Hours. 

**Practitioner:** Dr. Remington Ailuva. This log serves as a formal admission of ethics violations and breach of the Hippocratic Oath… I also break my oath to the ones I owe everything to.

*Click.*

Remy paused the recording and scratched a few lines onto a large yellow envelope. The body of the comatose young man, Pav, had been moved to the doctor’s laboratory.

*Click.*

Subject is a sixteen-year-old male, admitted following high-impact vehicular trauma. 

Subject was enrolled as a primary test subject for APEX R&D. 

Subject was administered the 'Amber' compound via intravenous injection, utilizing the provided black-matter substrate as a biological catalyst.

*Click.*

Two tubes, each jammed into Pav’s abdomen, slowly drained fluids. A dark, amber-colored, molasses-like fluid flowed into a glass beaker, while a jet-black, filmy slime dripped into a glass enclosure. Remy took several pictures. Each flash briefly illuminated the darkened laboratory, causing the amber to flash gold and the substance to shine a deep, dark blue. He shook the Polaroids dry before sliding them into the envelope.

*Click.*

Tissue regeneration was exponential; skeletal fractures and internal hemorrhaging were resolved within a 72-hour window. The catalyst appears to act as a predatory necrotic filler—consuming and replacing non-viable tissue in the absence of natural cellular mitosis.

During the one-week treatment, the subject exhibited acute neurobiological side effects: intense audiovisual hallucinations and REM-stage cognitive disturbances. Subject reported recurring thematic dreams involving a 'well' of the catalyst and perceived communication with the biological source of the Amber compound.

The doctor’s eyes were puffy and red. He wiped his face, printed out Pav’s patient files, and let the tape continue.

Upon cessation of treatment, the subject remained stable for seven days. No physiological abnormalities were noted, though the subject continued to report intrusive, fixation-heavy dreams regarding the Amber donor.

On July 13th, 2055, the subject sustained a lethal electrical discharge during an unauthorized attempt to vacate the facility.

*Ding.*

Remy jumped as the electronic chime startled him. The fluid drain was complete. He grabbed the beaker of dark amber and poured it into a centrifuge. The doctor’s computer screen illuminated a roiling, black substance swirling within the confines of the glass enclosure. A sticky film clung to the glass where the living ooze had attempted to climb.

Subsequent analysis confirms that Subject… Pav survived the terminal event. However, the subject is now physiologically dependent on the Amber compound. Depletion of the substance triggers immediate, systemic withdrawal and cellular collapse.

The black ooze began to slow as the moisture was sucked from its enclosure. Remy scooped a chunk out. He plopped the cup of dry crud into a centripetal machine. The creature spasmed angrily as the moisture returned to its prison.

I owe APEX… everything… but I can’t continue. I broke both oaths, but at least I can atone for one. I must atone.

The doctor pulled a container of golden amber fluid from its refrigerated chamber. The rest of the rack now stood bare. He poured the last of it into the mixer before plunging a new tube into Pav’s chest. The newly mixed dark amber hungrily flowed into its unconscious host.

“Pav, if you ever get to hear this… I’m sor—”

*Click.* **BANG. BANG.**

Remy spun to find a single, dark silhouette standing there, the tape recorder held in one hand. Two smoking holes in Pav’s head issued forth blood mixed with amber.

“What a waste, Doc.”

**BANG.**

Doc fell to the floor, searing pain causing his vision to darken. The figure wrenched the tube from Pav’s chest, letting the dark amber spill onto the tiles.

“Just… leave the boy alone! I can still he—” Remy’s mouth filled with blood. The intruder kicked the doctor—once, twice, three times for good measure. Remy could hear the sounds of glass shattering and the crackling of flames as his lab was ransacked.

“Please…let him li-” **BANG.**





# Last Chance

The drive back to Oakdale was a long one, but Luca had just spent a week in the hospital, so a three-hour trip wasn’t that bad. He got to catch up on his DMs, create several shitposts that made sense only to him, and blather loudly with his mom. Not much happened in the town Luca currently inhabited, though it had once been prosperous due to its abundance of oak trees. Drug addicts shambled in packs, high on the latest party drug. Younger kids sequestered themselves inside their parents’ homes, their lives spent primarily on the internet.



It was a great place to practice his warlockcraft. Luca’s mother pulled the rusted cybertruck up to his dilapidated mobile home.



“Okay, Mamacita, time to go back in your cage!”



“Sí, mijo, I love you!” Luca’s “mother” had a high-pitched, chirping voice that sounded ecstatic at the idea of being put in a cage. Her eyes rolled back into her head as a tiny finch wetly pushed its way out of her mouth. The empty corpse turned to snow before rapidly melting, drenching the interior of the car. Luca scooped the tiny mom-bird up and plunked her into a small birdcage. With a roll of his wrist, the cage disappeared.



“Home, sweet home!”



As soon as Luca stepped out of the car the former vehicle collapsed in on itself before a gust of wind carried the pile of rust away. Luca noticed a large pile of dust sitting on his front porch, a pair of glasses resting on top.



“Jane, you dumb bitch.”



Luca carefully stepped over the pile and made his way inside. His cat briefly looked up at him from his position on the couch before going back to cleaning his own butthole.



“Cool, I missed you, too.”



He grabbed a dustpan and a broom before heading back outside to sweep up the pile. Once he was done, Luca carefully slid the dust into a glass jar. He made his way back into the kitchen and added some week-old coffee grounds, a spoonful of cinnamon, and a cup of pomegranate juice to the dust jar. His concoction was placed on the carpet, between the CRT TV with an ancient gaming console attached to it and the couch where his cat continued to groom himself.

  
""Por los poderes de los antiguos, que me odian.""

  
Luca used one of his untrimmed nails to slice open the palm of his left hand. He sat on the ground and churned the contents of the jar in a counter-clockwise motion with his bleeding hand.

  
“Con la autoridad de mi madre bruja, que también me odia.”

  
The contents of the jar began to swirl into a noxious-looking brown gunk. A pair of eyes coalesced within the newly mixed filth. They were joined by a filmy line of a mouth that began to sputter against the muffling glass.

  
“Traigan de vuelta a esta estúpida zorra, Jane.”

  
A disembodied voice issued forth from the jar. “Luca! You piece of shit! You disintegrated me!”

  
Luca hocked a loogie into the jar before closing the top. “Bitch! You came to kill me! You’re lucky you were stupid enough to get caught in the first trap!”

  
“Wow, this is how you treat your best friend? I came to warn you about the coven and you bring me back as sludge in a jar?!”

  
“You lyin’ ho, and don’t call it a coven–I’m a WARLOCK–I can’t be part of your little girls club. I already know they chose you to kill me. You’re lucky to be sludge; I should’ve left you as dust!”



“Then you should’ve been a good friend and let me kill you! You know I’m trying to move up in the coven!”



Luca picked up the Jane-jar and gave it a furious shaking. He placed the jar on a shelf above the TV while the floating eyes attempted to reorient themselves. The exhausted warlock angrily stalked off to get some much-needed rest in his bedroom.



“Wait! Don’t leave me like this! At least let me watch TV! All I can see is your cat eating his own asshole! Please!”







# Apex

Agent Seth left the hospital, a glass enclosure held under one arm. One of the many autonomous cars—that his company kept—waited for him outside, ready to drive him back to APEX HQ. He preferred to walk. The agent placed the enclosure in the trunk, along with the separated amber sample, and sent the car ahead without him. The frigid air of the city did nothing to quell his boiling blood.



The city wouldn’t officially “wake up” for another hour or so, but the streets were still occupied by people who had over-enjoyed the nightlife. Homelessness had long since been made illegal, but that didn’t stop vagrants from taking “temporary rests” near whatever source of warmth they could find. The grisly work of the last hour had set him on edge. Innocent bums and drug-addled burnout yuppies wouldn’t cut it tonight.



Cutting through alleyways at 5:00 AM was not what the average citizen would consider wise, but Seth was looking to make unwise decisions.



“Nice suit, ape.”



Perfect. A group of young bippers were breaking into a car nearby. Their porcelain pieces pierced the windows, sending glass shattering inside. These opportunistic criminals weren’t above robbing a man if he looked well-off. Seth’s all-black suit, gloves, and expensive shades were tempting targets for any thief, even if they did mark him as an APEX agent.



“What’s an ape like you doin’ on our turf?”



“Funny, I don’t see a sign that says ‘Bitch Boy Territory’ anywhere. I must’ve missed it.”



The two thugs who weren’t looting the car came over to confront him.



“Ooh hoo hoo! We’ve got a comedian here!”



The first thug had an old revolver tucked into the band of his sagging pants. The second thug not-so-subtly flashed a knife in the agent’s direction.



“This is the territory of Jack the Bipper, ape. He doesn’t like your kind in his territory, flashing your nice clothes like you mean something, ya feel? Why don’t you leave your stuff with us and bounce on outta here, monkey boy.”



“I didn’t realize we were in the Castro, boys. I get that it’s SF, but you can’t just ask a man to take off his clothes. At least buy me dinner first.”



The first thug gave Seth a sarcastic “ha ha” before pulling the gun from his pants and shoving it into the agent’s face. Seth deftly grabbed the thug’s wrist and wrenched the gun toward the second thug, who was coming in hot with the knife.



**BANG.**



The knife went flying out of the second thug’s hand. His flabbergasted expression was interrupted by Seth’s boot colliding with his face.



**BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG.** 



*click click click.*



Seth grabbed the first thug’s hand and forced him to empty the gun into the wall. The agent kicked the discarded knife far away from the ensuing melee before hitting the first thug square in the jaw with a vicious uppercut. Seth took a step back and slowly pulled his own gun out between two fingers. He made a point of placing the firearm on a nearby trash can before stepping back toward the confused thugs.



“Attack a man, two-on-one, while he’s unarmed, and this is the result? Disappointing.”



The remainder of the gang—two other thugs still standing aghast by the half-looted car—joined their friends. The group of four exchanged a look before jumping Seth all at once. The smiling agent gleefully took blows to the face, sides, and stomach that he could have easily dodged. Seth laughed it all off as he threw wild haymakers into the faces of all four thugs.



“This is how it should be, boys!”



“Man, you fuckin’ crazy! Shut yo ass up!”



Seth traded punch after punch until the gang stopped swinging. Battered and bruised, the agent left the four men unconscious in the alley before completing the rest of his journey. The thrill of it all had worn off by the time he entered The Emperor hotel. He had gotten what he needed… for now.

1r403qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r403qd/the_shift/,The Shift,"We met at a pool party. I remember that day clearly; it was in the middle of an unforgettable heatwave. Alfie smiled at me from across the pool, and the rest was history. Not only was he gorgeous and completely unaware of it, but he was also a fantastic listener. No matter who he spoke to, he listened intently. He was never just waiting for his turn to speak. Never just nodding absentmindedly. He absorbed every word- eyes bright and understanding. Later, when I told him that was one of my favourite things about him, he smiled and said, “Most people just want to be understood. It isn’t difficult if you pay attention.” 

 

He has always paid attention. Even in the early months of our relationship, he remembered everything: how I take my coffee, which side of the bed I prefer, that I can’t sleep without my bedside fan or my childhood teddy, Scrappy. 

 

There had always been a quiet predictability to our life together. We’d wake up at the same time each morning. I’d shower first; he’d make coffee. We’d meet in the kitchen in the soft light of dawn before the day properly began, moving around one another with the ease that comes from long term familiarity. Sometimes we’d talk. Sometimes we wouldn’t. Silence never felt uncomfortable.  

 

Then came the shift. 

 

He was handing me my morning coffee. 

 

“Milk and two sugars, right?” 

 

I laughed because I thought he was joking. We’d been together for nine years, married for four, and I’d never taken sugar in my coffee. Not once. ‘No sugar, you’re sweet enough,’ he’d say. We had both been sleeping a little less than usual lately. I put it down to nothing more than a brief moment of forgetfulness caused by tiredness. I kissed him on the cheek, took the coffee, and told him not to worry about it. 

 

Then he started watching me sleep. Now, I’ve always been a light sleeper. A change in temperature or a shift in the light will wake me. For years that sensitivity never bothered me. If I woke in the early hours and turned my head, I’d find Alfie beside me exactly as expected- fast asleep with one arm tucked beneath the pillow, breathing deeply. Recently, though, I’d turn to face him and find him already awake. Not moving. Not on his phone, doomscrolling. Just simply lying there, looking right at me.  

 

The first time it happened, I smiled at him, still half-asleep, and asked what he was doing. 

 

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said. “Did I wake you?” 

 

“No,” I told him, and reached for his hand beneath the covers. 

 

But it kept happening. Not every night, but enough for me to pick up on it. Each time, the explanation was reasonable: he’d woken early, he’d had something on his mind, he hadn’t wanted to disturb me by getting up.  

 

Although it made sense, it kept me up at night. There was something about the way he was watching me that bothered me. It wasn’t intrusive or intense. If anything, it was gentle — the same attentive expression he’d always worn around me. But lying there in the dark, meeting his eyes before either of us had fully entered the day, I had the faint, disorienting sense that something was off. I just couldn’t put my finger on what.  

 

Even with minimal sleep, life continued, as it does; the usual routine of work, dinner, and an evening lounging on the sofa. All the normal things. He became more perceptive than ever- more aware of my moods. Quicker to anticipate what I needed before I asked. It felt, on the surface, like a deepening of the same gentle love he’d always shown me. Which is why when I’d catch him staring, I’d tell myself it was nothing more than a look of admiration. And, for a while, I had no reason to believe otherwise. 

 

With time, the staring crept its way into the daytime, too. I’d be washing the dishes and would catch him in the reflection of the kitchen window- standing behind me, still as a statue, just… watching me. I’d turn around and he’d spring back to life, tending to whatever menial task had previously garnered his attention. 

 

He also started repeating things I said. It would happen hours after the initial conversation, sometimes even the next day. He’d do it casually and in a slightly altered context, as though the words had occurred to him independently. 

 

One afternoon I mentioned that the air in the house felt “strangely heavy”. It wasn’t a particularly unusual observation, just something I had said without thinking as I opened a window. At the time, he’d simply nodded, but then later that evening, as we sat on the sofa scrolling through Netflix, he looked around the room and said those exact words.  

 

“The air feels strangely heavy.” 

 

I waited for a sign that he was joking — that he was deliberately echoing me. But instead, he looked mildly contemplative, like the thought was completely his own. When I asked what he meant, he shrugged. 

 

I know it might not sound like much, but I can’t express how unlike Alfie these behaviours were. There were other changes too, like slightly delayed responses. I don’t think anyone else would have picked up on it, but I knew my husband like the back of my hand. He was changing.  

 

If I laughed, he laughed, but a little too late. If I frowned, he frowned, but after a pause. It felt like he was mirroring me, as though without my lead he wouldn’t know which emotion to express. 

 

One evening, after a particularly shitty day at work, I relayed my frustrations to him. It was nothing dramatic, just office politics, the sort of thing we’d discussed a hundred times before. As I spoke, I watched his face. For a brief moment after I finished, his expression remained completely neutral. Then, as if remembering what should come next, his features arranged themselves into sympathy. 

 

“That sounds frustrating,” he said.  

 

The words were correct. The tone was correct, too. And yet, for reasons I couldn’t properly justify, I felt uncomfortable. Enough was enough. I decided I would call him out on it, hoping to clear things up to stop me feeling so on edge all the time.  

 

“You’ve been a bit… different, lately,” I said one day as we cleared the dishes, hoping I didn’t sound too accusatory. He looked up at me, his expression blank. 

 

“Different?” 

 

The word hung between us for a moment. I felt a flicker of embarrassment, wondering if maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. I opened my mouth to soften the blow, to explain that I hadn’t meant anything serious by it, but he spoke first.  

 

“I’m sorry if it feels that way. Work’s been taking up more space in my head than I realised.” 

 

His voice was warm. Reassuring. Just like always. I nodded, already prepared to let the matter go. But then, in that same even tone, he continued. 

 

“You’ve seemed a little on edge yourself recently.”  

 

“What?” I said, surprised. 

 

“I assumed that maybe you were just tired. You haven’t been sleeping properly.” 

 

He was right; I hadn’t. With a small, sympathetic smile, Alfie stepped closer, resting his hand lightly against my arm.  

 

“You’ve been noticing things more, haven’t you?” 

 

I nodded.  

 

“Sometimes when you focus on the little things too much, they start to feel bigger than they are.” 

 

I contemplated his words. It wasn’t until that exact moment I considered maybe I had been the problem all along. The conversation began with me expressing a small uncertainty about him, but now I was questioning myself instead.  

 

“Yeah,” I eventually replied. “Like you said, I’m probably just tired.” 

 

From then on, I deliberately tried to stop noticing things, telling myself that it’s easy for ordinary behaviours to appear unusual if you examine them too closely. So instead, when he paused before responding, I’d tell myself he was just thinking. When I caught him looking at me from across the room, I assumed he was just admiring me. When small details slipped — like a forgetful moment or a repeated phrase — I let them pass without comment.  

 

This worked at first. The house felt calmer. But underneath that calm ran a thin, persistent awareness that I was working quite hard to maintain it- that I was adjusting my own perception so that nothing he did would seem unusual enough to question.  

 

I snapped out of that mindset one evening when he did something so strange and out of character that I just couldn’t ignore it. I’d been brushing my teeth when I caught him staring again. I spun around and met his gaze, expecting him to smile or say something. He didn’t move, he didn’t break eye contact… he just stood there, hands by his sides, head tilted slightly, staring. Something about his eyes bothered me. They were a little too wide and there was a flicker of something I couldn’t quite place, and with it came a feeling I’d never felt towards Aflie before: dread.  

 

After what felt like eternity, he parted his lips to speak. 

 

“You’ve been brushing your teeth for a while now. Everything okay?”  

 

How long had he been standing there? He walked towards me, eyes unblinking. Instinctively, I took a step back. He noticed, and let out a chuckle, seemingly amused by my uncertainty. I tried to stand my ground as he approached me further, but my body flinched as he raised a hand to my shoulder. Another chuckle.  

 

“Come on, darling. Let’s go to bed.” 

 

My heart sank. Darling? He never called me that. I was certain, then: he was different.  

 

So, in the days that followed, I began testing him. While pretending everything was fine, I purposefully changed small details in my stories to see how he’d react. The old Aflie would have questioned me, maybe gently corrected me, but this altered Alfie didn’t register. Or if he did, he didn’t let on.  

 

I spoke about the day we first met, describing it as a snowy day in December. He didn’t correct me, so I kept going. I talked about wearing a brown fur coat when we passed each other on the street. I told an entirely fabricated story, watching him closely, waiting for him to burst out laughing or call me out on my bullshit, but he didn’t. He listened without interruption, smiling softly. 

 

That evening, as we lay in bed in the dark, he rolled onto his side and said softly, “you’re as beautiful as you were the day I met you.” 

 

I froze, waiting to see if he’d taken the bait. 

 

“I knew even then that you were someone I could build a life with. That beautiful snowy day changed everything for me.” 

 

I felt sick. I rolled over and pretended to be asleep. But I didn’t sleep at all that night. I lay there, staring at the wall, wondering where the Aflie I knew and loved had gone. I cried softly as he slept, oblivious to my heartache.  

 

The next morning, he handed me my coffee.  

 

“Two sugars,” he said. “Extra sweet, just like you.”  

 

I set the mug down on the counter a little too forcefully, startling him.  

 

“We didn’t meet in December,” I said flatly. “It was August. During that awful heatwave. Remember?” 

 

He looked up at me, confused.  

 

“No,” he said slowly. “It was definitely December. It was snowing. You were wearing that brown fur coat.”  

 

I scoffed and shook my head. “I’ve never owned a fur coat in my life. You know I hate fur.” 

 

He held my gaze, as if waiting for me to correct myself. 

 

“Are you sure?” 

 

“Absolutely sure,” I snapped, grabbing the mug and pouring its contents down the sink. “And I don’t take sugar in my coffee.”  

 

“Yes, you do. You always have. *Two sugars, sweet like you*. Are you feeling alright?” 

 

“No,” I snapped. “*No sugar, I’m sweet enough*.” 

 

We stood in silence waiting for the other to cave.  

 

“Sorry.” He muttered eventually. “I’ve been a bit forgetful recently. I’m sure you’re right.” 

 

He looked genuinely sorry and I felt a pang of guilt. He hadn’t raised his voice. He hadn’t said anything unkind. And there I was, snapping at him, slamming things about. Something I never did, not even on our worst days. I had acted out of character, and the irony of that was not lost on me. I exhaled deeply, the fight draining out of me as quickly as it had arrived. 

 

“No, I’m sorry,” I said quietly, unable to meet his eyes. “I shouldn’t have snapped like that.” 

 

He accepted my apology and kissed my cheek before leaving for work. Once again, I couldn’t shake the creeping suspicion that perhaps this really was all my fault, that I was the one distorting ordinary moments into something they weren’t. I felt like I was losing my mind.  

 

That evening, I would doubt my sanity once again. I was getting ready for bed, only Scrappy wasn’t on the pillow where I’d left him.  

 

“Alf?” I called, tearing apart the duvet and searching under the bed. He appeared in the doorway, wearing a pair of blue pyjamas I’d never seen before. He normally slept in his boxers.  

 

“Mmm?” 

 

“I can’t find Scrappy,” I said, putting the pyjamas to the back of my mind. “I’ve looked everywhere.”  

 

I was met with the blank stare I was becoming all too familiar with. 

 

“Scrappy.” I repeated. “I can’t find him.” 

 

Alfie pointed to the cupboard.  

 

“Why’s he in there?” I asked.  

 

“You put him there.” 

 

“What? No, I didn’t.” 

 

“Uh... yeah? You did. You definitely put him in there this morning, I watched you do it.” 

 

I tried to think back, but all I could remember of that morning was Alfie’s sorry expression and the guilt I’d felt for accusing him of being different. A dull ache pulsed behind my eyes, so I closed them, pinching the bridge of my nose. Maybe he was right. Perhaps I’d accidentally tidied Scrappy away. That didn’t feel right to me, but it wasn’t entirely impossible.  

 

I couldn’t focus in the office the next day. He had definitely been wrong, hadn’t he? Of course we met in the summer… right? Had I really put Scrappy in the wardrobe by mistake? Then I started to wonder if it even mattered at all. I eventually concluded that perhaps it didn’t, and, once again, I was prepared to let it all go. I stopped by the bakery on my way home from work to get some of those blueberry muffins he loved. A peace offering. A way to put this whole thing behind us.  

 

I let myself in the front door, box of muffins tucked under one arm. Before I could shout ‘hello’, I noticed him sitting on the sofa with his hands placed neatly in his lap.  

He wasn’t doing anything. Just sitting there, staring at the TV.  

 

It was switched off.  

 

Our eyes met in the reflection of the black screen, and he slowly turned to face me. He raised his arm, robotically, and gave a forced, unnatural wave of his hand. 

 

“Ah. You bought muffins,” his voice was devoid of emotion. “Chocolate?” 

 

“Blueberry…” 

 

“Oh.” His mouth formed a thin line, and he slowly turned away from me. 

 

“I thought they were your favourite,” I said to the back of his head. 

 

“I’m allergic to blueberries.” 

 

I stood there, dumbfounded. He absolutely was NOT allergic to blueberries. He wasn’t allergic to fucking anything. Anger surged through my veins, but I bit my tongue. He was messing with me; he had to be.  

 

“You weren’t the last time you ate them,” I muttered. 

 

“Look,” he replied, taking a deep breath and turning to face me. “I don’t know what’s going on with you recently, and I didn’t really want to say anything, but I’m starting to get worried. You keep getting things confused and it’s clearly making you angry. That’s so unlike you. You’ve just been so… different, lately.”  

 

“Me?” I scoffed. “You’re the one who keeps staring at me and copying me and being all fucking weird!” 

 

I had never raised my voice at Alfie before. He looked shocked, then disappointed. He shook his head solemnly.  

 

“See what I mean?” he said, quietly. “You’ve got it all backwards. You’re the one doing all those things. I wake up in the night and you’re just… watching me. Staring at me. And you keep repeating things I’ve said- really weird, insignificant things like ‘oooh, the air feels strangely heavy in here’, when I’d literally said that exact phrase only hours before.” 

 

What? There was no way. That couldn’t be possible… could it? My heart began to thud and my head spun, causing me to stumble backwards. Alfie jumped up and rushed over, offering me his arm. I took it, trying to swallow the sickness that was creeping up from the pit of my stomach.  

 

“Let’s talk about this later, okay?” he said softly, before kissing my forehead. “Why don’t you go take a nice bath? We can both take a moment to cool off, and we’ll have a chat this evening. Sound good?” 

 

I nodded. 

 

I took myself upstairs, locking the bathroom door behind me. For a while I just stood there, hands clutching the edge of the sink as I stared at my own reflection. The skin under my eyes was puffy, almost purple. I tried to slow down the sudden, shallow rhythm of my breathing.  

 

How could I possibly be the one in the wrong? I was certain that blueberry muffins were his favourite. We’d had blueberry cake at our wedding, too. It had this beautiful pale, baby blue icing, with fresh blueberries cascading down one side. I was sure of it. I made a mental note to dig out the photo album later and prove it to myself. 

 

I turned the taps on, letting the bathroom fill with steam as thoughts whirred around in my mind. I squeezed my eyes shut as a sharp, pulsing headache pressed behind my temples. I shifted my focus to the sound of the rushing water, waiting for the pain to fade into a dull ache. When I opened my eyes, the water had nearly risen to the rim of the tub. I lurched forward and twisted the taps, not bothering to question how long I’d zoned out for.  

 

I lowered myself into the bath. The house was quiet and the warm water offered some sense of comfort. My eyelids grew heavy and I allowed them to close, focusing on my breath. In, out. In, out. I stayed like that for a while, before drifting into a dreamless sleep.  

 

A loud creak woke me up. I glanced over at the locked door. The thin strip of light beneath it dimmed suddenly. A shadow. Every muscle in my body went rigid as I stared at that narrow line.  

 

Someone was standing there. Right on the other side of the door. Not moving. Not knocking. Just… there. I could feel it in the air, the way you can feel someone’s presence even without seeing them — that unmistakable awareness of another body occupying the space just inches away from yours. Seconds dragged past, heavy and distorted. My heart pounded.  

 

Then, without warning, the shadow vanished. Erratic footsteps tore down the hallway outside, thundering away from the door. Too fast. Too uneven. A chaotic scramble that sent a violent jolt through my entire body. 

I flinched so hard that the water sloshed over the side of the tub. 

 

The sound stopped as abruptly as it had begun, leaving behind a suffocating silence that pressed in from all sides. Had that really just happened? Had I been dreaming? 

 

In a daze, I reached for a towel and dried myself off. In the bedroom, I put on my pyjamas, grabbing Scrappy from the bed and pulling him close to my chest. I lingered in the doorway for a moment before forcing myself into the hall and down the stairs. When I reached the bottom and looked into the living room, I stopped.  

 

Everything was wrong. The sofa was pressed up against a different wall with a blanket I’d never seen before folded neatly over the back of it. The TV sat on the other side of the room. In fact, every piece of furniture was in a completely different place. I looked at the curtains. They used to be grey, but now were blue. The candles on the side table were green, not orange. But most disturbingly of all… there, on the mantelpiece, was a photo from our wedding. Slowly, I edged towards it. 

 

“Babe?” Alfie appeared from the kitchen. I lent in, examining the picture. We were cutting the cake. 

 

Our plain, white, wedding cake.  

 

I collapsed to my knees. Alfie hurried across the room, his footsteps quick but careful. He crouched down beside me, lifting my chin with his finger. 

 

“Hey… what is it?” he asked, his voice low and soft. The kindness in it was too much. My chest tightened and before I could stop myself, I began to cry. I buried my face in his chest, clutching his shirt. He wrapped his arms around me without hesitation, holding me close as I shook against him.  

 

“It’s going to be okay,” he whispered. “I’ve got you.” 

 

I took the next few days off work, and so did Alfie. I didn’t ask him to, but he insisted. He held my hand as I made a call to the doctors, setting up an appointment for the following week. He brought me coffee; black, no sugar. He even rearranged the furniture just to put me at ease.  

 

“Huh. I like it better this way,” he said, as he stood back and admired the room. I smiled. 

 

“Thank you,” I said, weakly. My head still throbbed and my eyes were still crusty from all the tears, but I felt okay. For the first time in a while, I felt hopeful. Alfie was right. It was going to be okay.  

 

We went to the appointment together. The doctor didn’t look at me when he spoke. 

“Stress,” he said, tapping something into the computer. “And exhaustion. Very common.” He printed the prescription and handed it to me. “These will help you sleep. Deep sleep- that’s what you need.” 

 

Alfie squeezed my hand with a reassuring smile. 

 

The first week of taking the tablets was bliss. I’d pop a pill and fall asleep within minutes. And it was a good sleep, too. Dreamless, like I was dead to the world. But nothing lasts forever, apparently, as sometime during the second week I started feeling the side effects.  

 

I kept having these awful nightmares. In them, I’d wake up to find Alfie acting strangely. In one dream he was completely naked and hunched over, his mouth hanging open in a wide, unnatural smile that stretched the skin of his cheeks. In another, I rolled over in bed to find him staring at me- his eyes so wide I could see the whites all the way around the irises. Every time, I’d squeeze my eyes shut, willing the dream to end. Eventually, I’d fall back asleep and wake up sometime later in a cold sweat.  

 

I’d tell Alfie about the nightmares each morning. He’d listen, frowning, equally as disturbed by them as I was. He suggested that perhaps my brain was just adjusting to the medication, that eventually the dreams would stop.  

 

“I hope so,” I said. “I don’t know how much more of this I can take.” 

 

“They’re not real, remember? Just dreams.” 

 

I nodded. “Just dreams.” 

 

That night I awoke suddenly, heart thudding. I sat up. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, and at the end of the hallway, something moved. 

 

He was there. On all fours. 

 

My husband was crouched at the end of the corridor, his spine arched strangely high. His head hung low between his shoulders. His eyes were wide, wild, and fixed on me. 

 

“Alfie?” 

 

His mouth opened. That same huge, silent smile.  

 

Then he moved. 

 

With a jerking of limbs he scurried at an inhuman speed, palms and feet slapping the floor as he rushed towards the bedroom.  

 

I shrieked and threw myself back into bed, dragging the covers over my head. The mattress dipped as he climbed onto it. I squeezed my eyes shut and held my breath, waiting for fingers, teeth, anything… 

 

I woke gasping for air. 

 

Morning light filled the room. The door was closed, Alfie’s side of the bed cold and empty. 

 

That night, I didn’t take a tablet. I kept this information to myself, not wanting to concern Alfie. I waited until he was in the bathroom, then slipped the tablet back into the bottle and returned it to the bedside drawer. When he came to bed, I pretended to swallow it with a sip of water. 

 

I lay awake for hours, waiting for nightmares that never came. At some point, Alfie stirred next to me. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, not wanting him to question why I was awake. I felt a soft tap on my shoulder. Damn it, I thought. He’s onto me.  

 

I kept my breathing slow and heavy, counting a few seconds before stirring to make my sleepy act seem more convincing. When I rolled over, his voice came from across the room. 

 

“*Over here*.”  

 

When my eyes adjusted to the night, I saw him standing rigidly in the corner of the room. His eyes bulged from his face, as though something inside his skull was pushing them outward. Saliva dripped from his gaping mouth, which was stretched into a wide, panting grin.  

 

Something at his side shimmered in the light of the moon. A knife.  

 

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. I watched in horror as he slowly raised the blade to his neck, dragging it gently across his throat in a silent, mocking promise. I shut my eyes tightly and turned away, burrowing beneath the duvet, my body locked in terror as I felt him crawl back into bed. He fell asleep not long after. I lay awake trembling, still unable to move. 

 

When the morning light finally crept through the curtains and I heard him rise to start his day, I realised what I’d witnessed hadn’t been a dream at all… because I had never fallen asleep. 

 

I made a plan to pack up my things and get the hell out of there. Whether I was imagining it or not, I couldn’t risk staying in that house with him.  

 

He checked on me before leaving for work. As I lay in bed, pretending to be sick, I mumbled some excuse about calling the office to tell them I wasn’t coming in. He rested his hand on my forehead, and it took every ounce of my being not to recoil.  

 

“You do feel clammy,” he said, feigning a look of concern. “Do you want me to stay with you?” 

 

My pulse raced. 

 

“No,” I said, trying to sound casual. “No point. I’ll be asleep for most of the day, I imagine.”  

 

He nodded.  

 

“Okay, well... take it easy. I’ll be back this evening to look after you. I love you.”  

 

I waited for the sound of the front door to close behind him before springing out of bed. I just needed the essentials: my keys, my phone, my charger, my purse. I’d figure the rest out later. I shoved my things into a bag and hurried down the stairs.  

 

Shit. Scrappy.  

 

I ran back up to the bedroom. He wasn’t on the bed. He wasn’t under it.  

 

The wardrobe.  

 

I flung open the cupboard and rifled through its contents. He was buried beneath a pile of clothes that had fallen from their hangers. I went to grab him, but something else caught my eye.  

 

The glossy corner of a photograph peeked out from a small gap in the back panel of the wardrobe. A sickening thought crossed my mind. Pressing gently against it, the panel shifted with a soft, reluctant creak, revealing a narrow seam that hadn’t been there before. Heart hammering, I pushed it further. It was a secret compartment. 

 

I took a closer look at the photo that had led me to this discovery. Vomit rose in my throat, my hands shaking as the picture fell from my gentle grasp. 

 

It was us on our wedding day. Cutting our cake.  

 

Our blueberry cake.  

 

Reluctantly, I lent forward, peering into the compartment. Our photo albums were back there, but they looked different. I pulled one out and opened it. 

 

On every page, sticky notes clung to the photographs. Frantic arrows, underlines, suggestions… The notes didn’t describe our memories; they dissected them, speculating how each image could be changed, reframed, and made to say something else entirely. There was a picture of us in the living room when we first moved in together. The furniture was exactly where I’d remembered it being.  

 

A cold, sharp dread settled in my chest as the pieces fell into place. 

 

Every conversation that had left me doubting myself, every time I caught him staring at me, every odd behaviour, every time he’d convince me I was the problem… all of it had been orchestrated. By him. By Alfie. By the love of my life.  

 

The slow erosion of my sanity hadn’t been accidental. For months and months he sewed the seed of doubt in my mind- manipulating me, tricking me, fucking gaslighting me. All of it had been real, and all of it had been him. 

 

I sat there on the bedroom floor, a sea of emotions rushing through me. I felt everything all at once, and it was too much for me to deal with then and there. A voice in the back of my head told me it would take years of therapy to unpack this. I wouldn’t be able to trust anyone ever again.  

 

Numbly, I retrieved my belongings and descended the stairs. The urgency I’d had only minutes ago had completely left my body. There wasn’t room for it.  

 

I was halfway to the door when it opened toward me.  

 

“Only me! I forgot my-“ 

 

We stopped. Our eyes met. With a look of concern I knew was pretend, Alfie examined my face- checking for tears, for anger, for anything that might tell him what he was walking into. I watched him do it. I watched the familiar softness appear, that careful attentiveness he wore when he thought something was wrong.  

 

Then he saw it. He saw that I knew.  

 

His concern vanished in an instant. It was as if a switch had been flipped behind his eyes; the warmth replaced with something icy and cold.  

 

“You figured it out.” He said.  

 

I didn’t shout. I didn’t cry. I didn’t run. I simply looked back at the stranger in front of me, the love I once had for him non-existent.  

 

“Why?” I asked. “Why did you do it?” 

 

He shrugged.  

 

“No.” I said. “I need an answer. It’s the least I deserve.” 

 

His eyes were steady and clear, but eerily empty, as if nothing human stirred behind them. 

 

“To see if I could.” 

 

And that was it. All that he’d done- all that he’d put me through… there was no reason, no master plan. It was all for sport.  

 

I pushed past him, door closing behind me as I headed for my car. I sat with my hands on the wheel as I stared back at the house we’d shared together. It was nothing more to me now than a pile of bricks.  

 

While reversing out the drive, unsure of where I was going, a realisation hit me. I understood with a cold and final clarity that the most terrifying part wasn’t what he’d done. It wasn’t why he’d done it. It was how easily he would go on living now- untouched, unbothered- while I gathered the scattered pieces of my mind he had so carefully, deliberately broken…  

 

*…just because he could.*

Also not advisable if you need good sleep the night of.

The advice: I'm in university right now and for a few reasons don't have proper medication. As many do, I have finals week right now (or month, in my case). I used to drink coffee a lot, about 4 cups a day every day. One day about two months ago I had to stop. When I could drink it again I was studying for an exam, and a sudden mental clarity kicked in for the whole day I never experienced before.

  
So I tried it. A few days before an upcoming exam (at least 3 full days), I quit all caffeine. The day of the exam, about half an hour before I drank coffee and the mental clarity was back. I've been doing this a few times since.   


PSA from what I've learned: I overdid it the first time. I had coffee before and during the exam, mentally I was fine and had a normal heartbeat but my hands were shaking. Also I become pretty anxious and talk too fast the rest of the day, hence the warnings. Obviously this isn't replacement for medication, I wish I didn't have to do this, nor is it healthy long term but it is something at least to try when you absolutely can't focus for that long on something that important.",2,1771014246.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1: OLIVE’s POV

I had three client presentations due tomorrow and a marketing strategy that was nowhere near finished, but all I could think about was Cole coming home in two weeks.

It had been two months since I’d seen him in person. Two months of video calls and texts that came later and later each night.

Grayson would tell me I was overthinking again. My stepfather had been the steady one since Mom remarried ten years ago—the kind of dad who actually showed up, who remembered what mattered.

I pulled my laptop onto the bed, staring at the half-finished campaign for Hopkins Company.

Pathetic.

I shoved the laptop aside and reached for my nightstand drawer.

The feeling of having my vibe pressed right where I needed it, imagining Cole in his blue practice jersey, hair slicked back, hands braced on the headboard above me…

Close. So close.

The door slammed open.

My mother stood in the doorway like she hadn’t just walked in on something she definitely shouldn’t have seen. When I scrambled to sit up, tangled in my sheets and trying to shove the vibe under my pillow, she smiled.

Actually smiled.

“Oh darling, I’m so sorry I interrupted. But playtime’s over.”

“God, Mom, knocking is a thing adults do.” My face was on fire. I shoved the vibe into my nightstand drawer so fast I almost broke my finger.

“Your door was wide open, Olive. Be grateful it was me and not Hunter.”

God, if my stepbrother had walked in on that I’d have to move to another state.

“Mom, stop. Please just stop talking.”

She pressed her lips together, but amusement danced in her eyes. I wanted to die right there.

Living in the renovated space above the garage was supposed to give me independence, but it didn’t stop my mother from barging in whenever she felt like it. Still, it beat paying two grand a month for some shoebox apartment in Seattle.

“We need to talk to you.” Her voice changed, got serious. “Grayson and I have some exciting news.”

Exciting news in this family usually meant something that benefited everyone except me.

“Olive Monroe, I want you downstairs in five minutes or I’m dragging you out of that bed myself.”

The second the door closed I grabbed my phone. I needed to hear Cole’s voice, needed something good to balance out whatever disaster my parents were about to drop on me.

I hit his contact. One ring. Two rings. Three.

Cole always answered. Always picked up when I called.

The screen flickered—video call accepted—and suddenly I was staring at a shaking camera propped up on something, angled weird.

I could see him.

Cole.

Not alone.

“Oh god, yes—Cole, right there—”

A woman’s voice hit me first, high-pitched and breathless. For a second my brain couldn’t process what I was seeing.

Cole on his back, head thrown against the pillow, mouth open as he groaned. A girl on top of him, blonde hair spilling down her back as she moved.

“Fuck, you feel so good—”

“Sophia—Christ, Sophia—”

His name for her. The way he said it like it was something precious. The phone jolted with every thrust.

I should’ve hung up.

Should’ve thrown my phone across the room and pretended I’d never seen this, never heard this.

I just sat there like an idiot. Frozen. Watching my boyfriend of two years moan another woman’s name.

“God, I’m close—Cole, I’m so close—”

His hands gripped her hips and pulled her down harder. That deep groan I thought he only made with me—

The phone slipped from my fingers.

It clattered onto my bed face-up. I could still hear them—the wet sounds, her moans, his name in her mouth over and over.

Two years.

Two years of standing in freezing arenas watching him play. Two years of driving three hours just to see him for a weekend. Two years of wearing his jersey like any of it mattered.

The entire time he’d been with someone else.

Someone named Sophia.

I grabbed the phone and stabbed at the screen until the call ended. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hit the right button.

Don’t cry. Don’t you dare cry over him.

But my throat was tight and my eyes were burning and I hated that I could still hear her voice in my head.

I pressed my palms against my eyes hard enough that it hurt.

He wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth a single tear, wasn’t worth the two years I’d given him or any of it.

But my face was already wet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I didn’t bother fixing my hair or washing my face before heading downstairs. What was the point.

The main house smelled like coffee and whatever my mom had baked earlier that week.

The second I opened the door both my parents’ heads snapped toward me.

“I was about to come drag you out of—” Mom stopped mid-sentence. “Olive, what’s wrong?”

I tried to say something, anything, but the second she asked, it was like a dam broke inside my chest.

I sobbed, ugly and gasping.

Grayson was already moving. He crossed the room in two strides and pulled me against his chest, one hand going to my hair and the other to my back, holding me while I fell apart.

“Shh, hey, it’s okay, you’re okay.”

“I caught him cheating.” My voice sounded wrecked.

Silence.

Complete silence.

I watched Mom’s mouth fall open. Watched Grayson’s jaw get tight.

“That Buffalo pretty boy with the perfect hair?” Mom’s voice came out sharp now. Angry.

“Diane,” Grayson warned.

“You deserve better than him, Olive. You always have.”

I wanted to believe him. Right now all I could think about was Cole’s face, about the way he’d looked at me the last time and said I love you right before asking if I could pick up his dry cleaning.

“We actually had something we wanted to tell you.” Mom’s voice softened. “Hunter got the call. He’s officially playing for the Chicago Wolves.”

My stomach dropped. “He got called up?”

The promise I’d made eight months ago, ‘when you make the NHL, I’ll be front row at your first game’ crashed into the reality of Cole’s face, Cole’s team, Cole’s city.

Hunter had been there for me through everything. Every breakup, every bad day, every moment I needed someone who understood what it felt like to be the spare part in someone else’s story.

“The game is next week,” Grayson added quietly. “I know the timing is complicated.”

“Cole is on that team.” My voice cracked. “I can’t—I can’t see him right now.”

“Then don’t look at him,” Mom said sharply. “You made a promise to your brother.”

Guilt twisted in my chest because she was right. I had promised. Back when it seemed like a far-off dream, something sweet and hypothetical, we’d joked about over pizza and bad movies.

Now it was real and the timing couldn’t be worse.

“We have tickets to his first game. Exclusive access—”

“I don’t know if I can do this.”

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. “Hunter would understand if you couldn’t make it. But he really wants you there, sweetheart.”

Mom grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and dropped it into my lap. “That’s your brother right there. Front page of Sports Illustrated.”

I looked down at Hunter’s face staring back at me.

The headline read NEW BLOOD: The Wolves’ Secret Weapon.

Pride swelled in my chest despite everything. He’d worked so hard for this.

I flipped to the next page, trying to focus on anything other than the thought of seeing Cole again.

What I saw made my entire body go still.

An ad for some energy drink. But I barely registered what the product was.

The man in the photo had his shirt half-unbuttoned. Abs so defined they didn’t even look real. The energy drink tipped against his mouth, liquid spilling over his bottom lip, dripping down his jaw and his throat.

His eyes were piercing. Cold blue. Staring directly at the camera like he could see through the page.

Like he could see me.

My thighs clenched.

“Olive?”

Grayson’s voice snapped me back. I’d been staring at the photo for way too long.

“Yeah, sorry, I just—” I cleared my throat. “Who’s this guy?”

Grayson’s entire expression changed. Got dark and tight. He gripped his coffee mug hard enough I thought it might crack.

“Zane Mercer.”

The way he said the name made it sound like it physically hurt him.

“Who?”

“My nemesis.” His voice was completely flat.

“Your nemesis? What are you, a supervillain?”

“He’s the NHL’s top player,” Mom said, her voice careful now. “And he’s made Grayson’s life hell since he started coaching. That man did things that forced him to leave the game entirely.”

I’d heard stories over the years. Vague references about someone who’d ruined everything, someone powerful and untouchable who’d destroyed his coaching career. But I’d never heard an actual name.

Zane Mercer.

Top player for the Chicago Wolves.

And apparently the last person Grayson wanted me thinking about.

I stared at the photo again. At those cold blue eyes, that dangerous jaw, the body that looked like it had been carved from stone.

At least if I had to spend a week in Chicago watching my ex-boyfriend pretend I didn’t exist, there’d be something worth looking at.

I closed the magazine and stood up, tucking it under my arm before either of them could take it back.

“Fine. I’ll go to Chicago.”

Mom blinked at me. “Really?”

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

“Besides,” I added, trying to be casual even though my heart was racing, “maybe watching some hockey will help me move on.”",1,1771014215.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

“Besides,” I added, trying to be casual even though my heart was racing, “maybe watching some hockey will help me move on.”",1,1771014210.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1: OLIVE’s POV

I had three client presentations due tomorrow and a marketing strategy that was nowhere near finished, but all I could think about was Cole coming home in two weeks.

It had been two months since I’d seen him in person. Two months of video calls and texts that came later and later each night.

Grayson would tell me I was overthinking again. My stepfather had been the steady one since Mom remarried ten years ago—the kind of dad who actually showed up, who remembered what mattered.

I pulled my laptop onto the bed, staring at the half-finished campaign for Hopkins Company.

Pathetic.

I shoved the laptop aside and reached for my nightstand drawer.

The feeling of having my vibe pressed right where I needed it, imagining Cole in his blue practice jersey, hair slicked back, hands braced on the headboard above me…

Close. So close.

The door slammed open.

My mother stood in the doorway like she hadn’t just walked in on something she definitely shouldn’t have seen. When I scrambled to sit up, tangled in my sheets and trying to shove the vibe under my pillow, she smiled.

Actually smiled.

“Oh darling, I’m so sorry I interrupted. But playtime’s over.”

“God, Mom, knocking is a thing adults do.” My face was on fire. I shoved the vibe into my nightstand drawer so fast I almost broke my finger.

“Your door was wide open, Olive. Be grateful it was me and not Hunter.”

God, if my stepbrother had walked in on that I’d have to move to another state.

“Mom, stop. Please just stop talking.”

She pressed her lips together, but amusement danced in her eyes. I wanted to die right there.

Living in the renovated space above the garage was supposed to give me independence, but it didn’t stop my mother from barging in whenever she felt like it. Still, it beat paying two grand a month for some shoebox apartment in Seattle.

“We need to talk to you.” Her voice changed, got serious. “Grayson and I have some exciting news.”

Exciting news in this family usually meant something that benefited everyone except me.

“Olive Monroe, I want you downstairs in five minutes or I’m dragging you out of that bed myself.”

The second the door closed I grabbed my phone. I needed to hear Cole’s voice, needed something good to balance out whatever disaster my parents were about to drop on me.

I hit his contact. One ring. Two rings. Three.

Cole always answered. Always picked up when I called.

The screen flickered—video call accepted—and suddenly I was staring at a shaking camera propped up on something, angled weird.

I could see him.

Cole.

Not alone.

“Oh god, yes—Cole, right there—”

A woman’s voice hit me first, high-pitched and breathless. For a second my brain couldn’t process what I was seeing.

Cole on his back, head thrown against the pillow, mouth open as he groaned. A girl on top of him, blonde hair spilling down her back as she moved.

“Fuck, you feel so good—”

“Sophia—Christ, Sophia—”

His name for her. The way he said it like it was something precious. The phone jolted with every thrust.

I should’ve hung up.

Should’ve thrown my phone across the room and pretended I’d never seen this, never heard this.

I just sat there like an idiot. Frozen. Watching my boyfriend of two years moan another woman’s name.

“God, I’m close—Cole, I’m so close—”

His hands gripped her hips and pulled her down harder. That deep groan I thought he only made with me—

The phone slipped from my fingers.

It clattered onto my bed face-up. I could still hear them—the wet sounds, her moans, his name in her mouth over and over.

Two years.

Two years of standing in freezing arenas watching him play. Two years of driving three hours just to see him for a weekend. Two years of wearing his jersey like any of it mattered.

The entire time he’d been with someone else.

Someone named Sophia.

I grabbed the phone and stabbed at the screen until the call ended. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hit the right button.

Don’t cry. Don’t you dare cry over him.

But my throat was tight and my eyes were burning and I hated that I could still hear her voice in my head.

I pressed my palms against my eyes hard enough that it hurt.

He wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth a single tear, wasn’t worth the two years I’d given him or any of it.

But my face was already wet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I didn’t bother fixing my hair or washing my face before heading downstairs. What was the point.

The main house smelled like coffee and whatever my mom had baked earlier that week.

The second I opened the door both my parents’ heads snapped toward me.

“I was about to come drag you out of—” Mom stopped mid-sentence. “Olive, what’s wrong?”

I tried to say something, anything, but the second she asked, it was like a dam broke inside my chest.

I sobbed, ugly and gasping.

Grayson was already moving. He crossed the room in two strides and pulled me against his chest, one hand going to my hair and the other to my back, holding me while I fell apart.

“Shh, hey, it’s okay, you’re okay.”

“I caught him cheating.” My voice sounded wrecked.

Silence.

Complete silence.

I watched Mom’s mouth fall open. Watched Grayson’s jaw get tight.

“That Buffalo pretty boy with the perfect hair?” Mom’s voice came out sharp now. Angry.

“Diane,” Grayson warned.

“You deserve better than him, Olive. You always have.”

I wanted to believe him. Right now all I could think about was Cole’s face, about the way he’d looked at me the last time and said I love you right before asking if I could pick up his dry cleaning.

“We actually had something we wanted to tell you.” Mom’s voice softened. “Hunter got the call. He’s officially playing for the Chicago Wolves.”

My stomach dropped. “He got called up?”

The promise I’d made eight months ago, ‘when you make the NHL, I’ll be front row at your first game’ crashed into the reality of Cole’s face, Cole’s team, Cole’s city.

Hunter had been there for me through everything. Every breakup, every bad day, every moment I needed someone who understood what it felt like to be the spare part in someone else’s story.

“The game is next week,” Grayson added quietly. “I know the timing is complicated.”

“Cole is on that team.” My voice cracked. “I can’t—I can’t see him right now.”

“Then don’t look at him,” Mom said sharply. “You made a promise to your brother.”

Guilt twisted in my chest because she was right. I had promised. Back when it seemed like a far-off dream, something sweet and hypothetical, we’d joked about over pizza and bad movies.

Now it was real and the timing couldn’t be worse.

“We have tickets to his first game. Exclusive access—”

“I don’t know if I can do this.”

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. “Hunter would understand if you couldn’t make it. But he really wants you there, sweetheart.”

Mom grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and dropped it into my lap. “That’s your brother right there. Front page of Sports Illustrated.”

I looked down at Hunter’s face staring back at me.

The headline read NEW BLOOD: The Wolves’ Secret Weapon.

Pride swelled in my chest despite everything. He’d worked so hard for this.

I flipped to the next page, trying to focus on anything other than the thought of seeing Cole again.

What I saw made my entire body go still.

An ad for some energy drink. But I barely registered what the product was.

The man in the photo had his shirt half-unbuttoned. Abs so defined they didn’t even look real. The energy drink tipped against his mouth, liquid spilling over his bottom lip, dripping down his jaw and his throat.

His eyes were piercing. Cold blue. Staring directly at the camera like he could see through the page.

Like he could see me.

My thighs clenched.

“Olive?”

Grayson’s voice snapped me back. I’d been staring at the photo for way too long.

“Yeah, sorry, I just—” I cleared my throat. “Who’s this guy?”

Grayson’s entire expression changed. Got dark and tight. He gripped his coffee mug hard enough I thought it might crack.

“Zane Mercer.”

The way he said the name made it sound like it physically hurt him.

“Who?”

“My nemesis.” His voice was completely flat.

“Your nemesis? What are you, a supervillain?”

“He’s the NHL’s top player,” Mom said, her voice careful now. “And he’s made Grayson’s life hell since he started coaching. That man did things that forced him to leave the game entirely.”

I’d heard stories over the years. Vague references about someone who’d ruined everything, someone powerful and untouchable who’d destroyed his coaching career. But I’d never heard an actual name.

Zane Mercer.

Top player for the Chicago Wolves.

And apparently the last person Grayson wanted me thinking about.

I stared at the photo again. At those cold blue eyes, that dangerous jaw, the body that looked like it had been carved from stone.

At least if I had to spend a week in Chicago watching my ex-boyfriend pretend I didn’t exist, there’d be something worth looking at.

I closed the magazine and stood up, tucking it under my arm before either of them could take it back.

“Fine. I’ll go to Chicago.”

Mom blinked at me. “Really?”

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

If you don’t want to default to an overpriced dinner reservation, here’s a tight shortlist of things actually worth leaving the house for:

❤️ **Sweetheart Festival — Downtown Loveland (Saturday)**  
Live music, weddings, heart art installations, downtown energy. If you’ve never done Valentine’s in Loveland, this is the year.

🎶 **LoversFest @ The Aggie (Saturday night)**  
Dance floor, DJs, not subtle, very fun.

🌲 **Winter Walk + Eagle Spotting**  
Bare cottonwoods = better bird watching right now. Fossil Creek, Lake Loveland, Lake Estes — solid winter magic if the sun’s out.

🍷 **Foothills Winter Farmers Market (Saturday morning)**  
Coffee + local makers + easy Valentine’s browsing without the dinner chaos.

(There are plenty of things for all the single folks out there, too!)

That’s just the short list.

Every Tuesday, I send a full Northern Colorado roundup (Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Greeley, Estes, Berthoud, Timnath, Johnstown, Severance, Fort Lupton, etc.) for free.

It’s basically for people who don’t want to scroll 20 different sites and would rather get one thoughtful mix of local history, trail ideas, small business gems, and the best things happening across the region.

If that’s you, link’s in the comments.

1r3ztvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r3ztvh/how_to_deal_with_toxic_in_laws/,How to deal with toxic in laws,"My fiancés sister and I have always gotten along pretty well. We’ve known each other for 7 years or so and have never been super tight but we have hung out quite a bit on and off through out the years. A little more once I started dating her brother.

In the last year , she’s been very distant. When I say distant I mean never answers texts , doesn’t reach out , comes around when it’s holidays and there’s gifts involved and will come out of me and my boyfriend are paying but other than that we don’t hear from her (I’m sure you can already see where I’m going with this.) since I’ve mentioned she only seems to want to come around if she’s getting something. (My boyfriend recently said she’s always sort of been this way.)

Anyways , she will text me sometimes talking about how much she hates her own mom and how much she hates her sister (her sister is 20 and she’s 25.) 

She’s always done this and ranted about them and bitched but what’s very confusing is I’ll ask her if she wants to hang out , go to target , coffee shop , catchup at a park or whatever and she always says no. But what’s weird is if her mom and sister want to hang out she is always there and it almost seems like it’s bc they’re buying her things (meals , make up , books , coffee) and it makes me feel bad bc it’s almost like she doesn’t care about time with me , she just cares about what’s bought for her … sort of opportunistic in a way. 

Should I stop asking her to hang out? Should I mention it to her ? Or she I just let her be who she is and stop extending invites ? 

As far as my boyfriend’s family it is a pretty toxic family dynamic they have going on.  I’m sure a lot of this is what she’s just always done but even her grandma says she is very hot and cold unless there’s something in it for her.

1r3zsiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r3zsiw/girlfriend_is_stressing_out_about_her_boss_and_i/,Girlfriend is stressing out about her boss and I don’t know what to say,"My girlfriend works in a coffee shop inside a mall with 3 other female coworkers. Their manager, a guy about 27 years old I believe, just recently got fired after an investigation that lasted about 2 weeks. He got reported by one of the workers because he told her that he was going to report her because she is always late and takes advantage of everyone’s time. So she reported him to HR after he reported her for always being late. 

The thing is, their manager is really weird. He is racist and makes sexual comments about his staff, including my girlfriend, all around 20 years old. He has said that he only hires attractive female workers. He called my girlfriend a sexy librarian. He makes comments about another worker’s butt multiple times. One time, the my girlfriend and her coworkers were talking about the anatomy of vaginas, specifically about being “innie” or “outtie”. He heard this and said, “now I know how y’all’s vaginas look like” and then proceeded to tell my girlfriend that he told his wife about this and that “he kept picturing her vagina” because it was his “intrusive thoughts” or whatever. 

My girlfriend told him to never talk about her like that which after that, he did stop. There’s other sexual comments he makes as well as sexist comments. He also says the n word regularly as a white guy and he also made islamophobic comments towards my muslim girlfriend. He’s a recovering alcoholic and he has a sponsor that visits regularly as well. 

Everyone else got along well with him actually and two of the workers were friends with him. During the investigation, they denied everything they asked about him. My girlfriend didn’t want to be involved but the coworker that reported him, mentioned her by name and said she can confirm everything. My girlfriend confirmed some of it, like the vagina comment, and denied most of the other stuff. She was freaking out the entire time because she didn’t want to be involved and she claimed that she had already resolved her issues with him. She was also worried that if he got fired, he would start drinking again. She also said that he was a very laidback boss and let them get away with a lot of stuff like dress code, he was easy with shifts and changing them or if they got in late, and if they said they were tired, he just let them sit down and not work for a while. So he was a very laidback manager if it wasn’t for all the weird stuff he said. 

I understood that part but honestly, I didn’t feel bad for any of the consequences he’s facing. I think he’s weird. But my girlfriend has been really freaking out and feeling bad about having to say stuff about him to HR. I kept trying to reassure her that first of all, she didn’t start this situation and that she shouldn’t be feeling bad for him. He still made those choices himself. Also, I told her that there was nothing she could’ve done because if she lied to HR and for some reason they found out, she would have been fired so I thought it’s better not to risk it. Today she found out that he was fired which yeah it sucks because he was very easygoing and not strict, but what can you do. Whatever I tell my girlfriend she had just not been listening to me and just kind of brushes it off and keeps on freaking out about it.  I don’t know what to say anymore to be honest. I’ve been trying to reassure her and be understanding about it, but now i’m getting kind of annoyed that she won’t stop feeling bad and blaming herself when she shouldn’t even be putting that type of pressure on herself. There was literally nothing she could’ve done. She didn’t report him either. It was a petty thing to do on behalf of the coworker that did report him because she never felt the need to report him until she was about to get in trouble, but my girlfriend wasn’t involved in that. We’re planning on hanging out later today and I know she’s going be feeling super anxious and worried and I don’t know what I’m going to say. She already knows I didn’t like her manager and I don’t want to sound like an asshole. ",1,1771013582.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1r3zmn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r3zmn2/sf_the_last_musicians/,[SF] The Last Musicians,"I remember hearing music made by people when I was a kid. My grandparents managed to save some physical disks with digital music files. I remember thinking how old fashioned the shiny little disks looked. 

The music was hard to describe. Stripped back? Or maybe minimalist compared to the generated music I was used to. It felt ‘human’ in a way that I didn’t know music could.

When my parents inherited the disks, they turned them in to be destroyed. My dad was a higher-up in the company, and said they were contraband. At the time, it didn’t bother me so much. I still had my favorite generated music to listen to.

In my twenties I moved to Los Angeles looking for work. The dense smog and oppressive neon advertising made me homesick, but there was nothing back there for me.

I was going down an alley on my way to the Career Assignment Center when this sound cut through the traffic noise. It sounded lonely and familiar. It was like a song, but simple and beautiful.

I followed it and found the source. An old man sitting on his 2nd story balcony. He was holding this strange object with metal wires strung across a wooden frame. When he struck the wires, sound came from it.

I sat and listened for a while, enamored with the way the music danced in my mind. It was sad yet hopeful to my ears.

When he finished his song, he glanced down at me, obviously amused by my dumbstruck expression.

“First time?” He asked, setting the wooden object down.

It took a moment to register that he was speaking to me, “Oh… Yeah.” I mumbled.

“I remember my first time,” He chuckled, “I didn’t know what to make of it either.”

He invited me in and we talked about music and the musicians of the past. He showed me the “instruments” he had. That’s what he called all of his things that made sound.

The apartment was small, it smelled of old wood and stale laundry, but I was amazed to see so many different types of instruments.

His name was Jacob. He'd been inspired by his grandfather who was a musician before the war, when making music was still legal. His family had to go into hiding, so Jacob learned to play in a dusty attic above a laundromat.

I was running late, so I thanked him for the story and went on my way, but the sounds replayed in my mind. I kept imagining myself playing, and my hands would subconsciously mimic how Jacob held the instrument.

I went back one night after failing another placement test at the Career Center.

I asked him to play for me again, but when he offered to teach me instead, my heart almost leapt out of my body.

The first time I held an instrument, I was amazed by how natural it felt in my hands, but was disappointed that when I hit the strings, music didn’t come out. It was just sound.

He laughed, “Oh, it takes time before you can make it sound nice. Here, let me show you something.” He showed me where to put my fingers and how hard to press.

When I played this time, there was structure. It sounded beautiful. I couldn’t help but smile.

“That was a chord.” He said.

It became an obsession. Every waking moment I was practicing and learning.

Jacob had his own collection of disks and he showed me music from the greats of his grandfather's time and before.

For months I slept on his couch and learned everything I could. Eventually, I stopped going to the Career Center altogether.

I got a call from my dad one day. He had found out that I stopped taking placement tests and wanted to know why.

I felt my chest go tight, “I’m doing research on what I want to do.” I said.

“You can do research at the Career Center.” His voice was cold, tense.

We argued for a while before eventually, I snapped.

“I’m learning to play music!” I screamed.

The line went silent on the other side before I heard the click of him hanging up.

He reached out to the corporate headquarters in LA, told them I was wandering the streets without a job.

We were playing together one late night, laughing as we harmonized and improvised on our instruments. 

We stopped when we heard the sound of the drone’s jets hovering outside Jacob’s apartment.

His eyes went wide and he jumped up, trying to find a place to hide his instrument. I did the same, but it was too late.

The drone crashed through the window and tasered Jacob, sending him convulsing on the floor. There was a sickening thump his head made when it connected with the coffee table.

I’m ashamed to admit that I dropped my instrument and surrendered. When I looked over at Jacob, I noticed the blood pooling under him.

I begged and cried, I shouted at the drones to get medical help, but they just ignored me. Methodically, they gathered all of the contraband they could find from the apartment before leaving.

I managed to hide one of the disks under my shirt while the drones were searching. It was one that we had recorded the night before.

When the paramedic drone arrived, Jacob was already dead.

I was sent to a re-education center where I served a sentence for corporate espionage. Every day my will to fight back weakened. They put me through countless “classes” and “assignments” about how to contribute to the company.

I stopped humming those old songs I learned with Jacob. I stopped daydreaming about sitting on his couch those warm summer nights as we played until our fingers hurt.

When they released me, I was a blank slate.

I was sitting in the subway, listening to a song playing on the loud speaker, when a memory surfaced in my mind.

“You know,” Jacob said, setting down his instrument for the night, “The generated music was trained on man-made stuff. There’s still a piece of us in it.”

I felt a grin creep across my face for the first time in months.

Now, I work in a data center. I still look out into the enrichment park outside and imagine playing music with Jacob; out where everyone can see and listen.

When I get home, I open my dresser drawer and find the little shiny disk that holds the only record of our music. The only one that survived the raid.

I still listen to it when I get the chance.

1r3zmka,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1r3zmka/design_tips_that_actually_help_airbnb_listing/,Design Tips That Actually Help Airbnb Listing Perform Better,"I work as a designer and have been helping short-term rental owners improve performance through design. Many listings struggle because they’re set up like a personal home rather than thoughtfully designed for the guest experience or they rely on only the bare essentials, which can feel flat and easily get overlooked when travelers are comparing options.

Here are a few things I consistently see make a measurable difference that I wanted to share. I hope this is helpful for some! 

1. Your Listing Photos Set the First Impression

Guests judge your space before they read a single word, so lead with your strongest feature, whether that’s the kitchen, bathroom, or a standout living area. Focus on a clear focal point, good lighting, and minimal clutter so the space feels inviting right away. Most people decide within seconds whether to keep clicking.

2. Cohesive Design Always Feels More Elevated

Many Airbnbs end up feeling pieced together with a mix of random décor or, on the other end, little to no personality at all. Selecting a clear design direction and carrying it throughout the space creates a more intentional, elevated feel that helps your listing stand out. When a space feels distinctive and thoughtfully done, it becomes more memorable and enhances the overall guest experience.

3. Strategic Updates Matter More Than Full Renovations

You don’t need to gut a space to improve performance. Smaller, visible upgrades, like updated hardware, improved lighting, a fresh backsplash, wallpaper and fresh paint, andbetter fixtures have a big impact in photos and show that the property is well cared for.

4. Comfort Is Key

Good design may get the click, but comfort is just as important. Quality mattresses and bedding, plush bathroom linens, thoughtful toiletries, blackout curtains, luggage space, charging stations, and ample hooks or hanging space all contribute to a stay that feels effortless and functional.

5. Incorporate Thoughtful Local Touches

Many travelers book Airbnb's to experience something unique. Displaying local design elements, such as artwork from local makers, coffee table books, and thoughtfully presented neighborhood guide helps create that sense of place and is a wonderful way for your guests to discover the local community.

  
I am curious what updates have actually made a difference for others.

I've noticed on recent day-hikes that when I remove the trangia stove from the plastic box it's leaked.  The seal was just replaced, and I've got three of the stoves and all are equally bad.  Is this really bad luck, or is this common?

I've seen conflicting advice on whether to store fuel inside the stoves, but it seems convenient when I only want to make one pot of noodles, and one cup of coffee in an afternoon trip.",2,1771013192.0,trangia,2,1.0,False

“You bet! They’re so good. You’re making them really Irish today,” I said.



They were really good, sweeter than usual. She must have tried a new recipe. I could barely taste the alcohol; only the burn.



“Only the best for my husband!” she said, smiling.



I smiled back at her. I loved her so much. The summer air blew through the window, warming our house, but her warmth made it feel like a home.



She was joyful this morning, looking at me every chance she got with a beautiful smile. After our fights, she would usually sit at the table, silent, but never forgot to make breakfast. She understood how this house worked.



I used to fight with my Mom, too. Every morning after, I had to wear long-sleeve T-shirts no matter how hot it got, but I still loved her. The fights didn’t change that. 



“You look happy!” my wife remarked.



“Of course, I'm just thinking of my Mom, but you seem to be in a great mood too, honey.”



“I just feel wonderful this morning. I finally decided to do it!”



“To do what?”



“It’s a secret.”



“You know I hate secrets.”



“Don’t worry. I’ll let you know soon.” She winked and turned around, making another cup.



Our fights were nothing like the ones I had with Mom. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t let anyone do those things to me. That I would be stronger, but I wouldn’t ever do what my Mom did to my wife.



My stomach began to growl. I was used to it tensing in the morning, but this was different.



“What did you put in the coffee, honey?”



She didn’t say a word.



It soon felt like daggers were stabbing into my intestines. I tried to hold it in, but collapsed to the ground. Sweat formed at my temples, and my vision began to blur.



“Call…call an ambulance.”



“It’s finally quiet. You can’t hurt me anymore.”



I couldn’t speak; the pain was bursting through my body. The tiles felt cold against my cheeks. My wife came over and stared at me with her two black eyes and a bruised lip, while I shivered on the ground. The smell of coffee turned to a strong metallic odor.

1r3zf7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1r3zf7q/hiking_in_patagonia_gluten_free/,Hiking in Patagonia Gluten Free,"As promised from my longer post a few days ago, here is my experience with being celiac and eating gluten free on the W and in El Chalten. If you are seeing this post first and you are trying to plan your trip, the much more comprehensive post is titled “TDP&El Chalten hiking explained”. If you are bringing your own food for either hike. I highly recommend bringing your dehydrated meals from your country of origin so that you have the best selection possible. In Puerto Natales I was able to buy gf labelled dehydrated meals, but they were far less quality than the ones I brought from home. I am from Canada and used backpackers pantry. The chicken pad thai is delicious. 

When you are asking for gf in Chile the phrase will be “sin gluten” and in Argentina it will be referred to as “sin tacc”

**Puerto Natales:**

The places I ate in PN were Dina’s for breakfast, 

Mesita grande for lunch, and La Tapera for dinner. I also got some food from a grocery store along with some boiled eggs to go from Dina’s for my breakfast the morning of starting the W. All these places are on the find me gf app.

**Full board on the W:**

You will be happy to know that the full board option is easily done gf. No need to request anything special ahead of time either. Just purchase the meals as normal. When you arrive at each campsite, they will ask you if you have any dietary restrictions. They cater to both gf and vegetarian. They will write down the restrictions you tell them. Then at Breakfast you simply tell the staff you require your meal to be sin gluten, and they will gladly point out to you what you can have. They will also provide gluten free bread. When you request your box lunch, once again, advise them sin gluten, and your sandwich will then be made with gluten free bread. I had the full board and was not glutened once. It will be buffet style at the Vertice campsites. So the staff will just show you what options are gf. On the Las Torres side, they only need to make minor adjustments to the standard meal to make it gf. The gluten free bread is not great, but to be able to do this whole hike, with meals provided, that are gf, is a miracle in itself, and I was not complaining. Dinner will be the same process. 

**El Chalten:**

When hiking in El Chalten, most hikes can be done as day hikes. So if you are someone who is not into camping, then you can bring enough snacks, or food from town to get you through the day. There’s a small gf shop/restaurant in town called “Entre Aguas. Sin tacc” and they do sandwiches that you could take on the hike. They also have great food and coffee and the lady working there is very nice. For me, I did a three day hike, and this is where my dehydrated meals came into play. I rented camping gear at Patagonia hikes, which included a stove and a pot. I bought the gas in town as well and brought all this with me on the trail. I am a big eater so I brought 6 meals for the 3 days. 2 lunch-2dinner-2 breakfast. The restaurants I went to in El Chalten are- Butch(limited knowledge of gf), my hostel Rancho Grande, La Cervecería Chaltén, and Parrilla La Oveja Negra. All were great. Also all on find me gf.

**El calafate:**

The two places I ate here were “Delicias sin TACC” which has sandwiches and amazing desserts. The brownie was incredible. I also had dinner at “La Zaina Cocina Patagónica” which is dedicated gf, and was good, but I thought it was overpriced for the small portions. It’s a fancier presentation. Both on find me gf. 

I also brought enough RX bars to last me through both hikes, some beef sticks, and a large bag of almonds sectioned into smaller ziploc bags. Only roasted almonds are allowed in the country, raw will not be accepted. 

Feel free to ask me any other questions you may have.

Started studying debate psychology, rhetoric, body language research, and honestly? The patterns I found were wild. Most people think winning debates is about facts and logic. Nope. It's about understanding how the human brain processes information under pressure and using that to your advantage.

I've spent months consuming content from debate champions, hostage negotiators, trial lawyers, and psychology research. Here's what actually works when you need to hold your ground and change minds.

**The power of strategic silence**

This one comes straight from Chris Voss's work (former FBI hostage negotiator). Most people are terrified of silence in debates, so they fill every gap with words. Bad move. When you pause after someone makes a point, two things happen: they get uncomfortable and start talking more (often revealing weaknesses in their argument), and you look more thoughtful and confident.

Try this: after your opponent finishes, count to three before responding. Sounds simple but it's stupidly effective. The silence forces them to either backtrack or over-explain, and you gain control of the tempo.

**Never Say Never: How Our Brains Work Against Us** by Daniel Kahneman breaks down cognitive biases that trip people up in arguments. The availability heuristic, confirmation bias, anchoring, all that stuff. Understanding these makes you dangerous because you can spot when someone's brain is taking shortcuts. Even better, you learn to avoid these traps yourself. The book won a Pulitzer and Kahneman's a Nobel Prize winner, but he writes like he's explaining things to a friend over coffee. Game changer for understanding why people believe what they believe.

**Frame control is everything**

This insight comes from Scott Adams (Dilbert creator, weirdly good at persuasion psychology). Whoever controls the frame controls the debate. If someone says ""why don't you care about X?"" and you defend yourself, you've already lost. You've accepted their frame that you don't care.

Instead, reframe immediately: ""That's not the right question. The real issue is Y."" Now they're defending against YOUR framework. I started practicing this in meetings and the shift in dynamic is insane. People naturally defer to whoever sets the conceptual boundaries of the discussion.

**The Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane (Stanford lecturer, coaches executives and politicians) taught me that perceived competence matters more than actual competence in debates. She breaks down specific body language techniques: keeping your hands visible, holding eye contact for 3-5 seconds before looking away, using hand gestures that match your argument's emotional weight. The book's backed by neuroscience research but super practical. I went from looking nervous to looking like I actually knew what I was talking about, even when I was figuring it out on the fly.

**The steel man technique**

Found this in Julia Galef's work on rationality. Instead of attacking the weakest version of someone's argument (straw man), you present the STRONGEST possible version of their position, then dismantle it. This is counterintuitive as hell but it works because it makes you look fair minded and intellectually honest. When you say ""the best argument for their position would be..."" before destroying it, you gain massive credibility with any observers.

**Rhetoric: The Art of Persuasion** by Aristotle. Yeah, it's 2000 years old. Still the blueprint. Ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), logos (logic), you need all three and most people only use one. Aristotle breaks down exactly how to balance them depending on your audience. The Penguin Classics edition has modern commentary that makes it digestible. This book will make you question everything you think you know about persuasion. Best rhetoric manual ever written, period.

**Energy management beats information management**

Here's something from competitive debate research: stamina matters more than people think. Whoever maintains their energy and composure longest usually wins. When you get tired, you make logical errors, lose frame control, start getting defensive.

Practice this: before any important discussion, do 20 jumping jacks. Sounds dumb but it floods your system with oxygen and adrenaline. Also, the Finch app helps me maintain consistent sleep and exercise habits, which directly impacts how sharp I am in high pressure conversations. Can't dominate debates if you're running on 4 hours of sleep and coffee.

**The pre suasion principle**

From Robert Cialdini's research on influence. What you say RIGHT before your main argument determines how people receive it. If you want someone to agree that your solution is cost effective, mention something about efficiency or value moments before presenting your idea. Their brain is now primed to evaluate your proposal through that lens.

I started using this in emails too: ""Given how much we value innovation..."" before pitching a risky idea. The setup does half the persuasion work before you even make your actual point.

For practicing debate skills, there's a fascinating YouTube channel called Charisma on Command that breaks down body language and rhetorical techniques used by politicians, comedians, and public figures. They analyze everything from hand gestures to vocal tonality. Weirdly educational for understanding the nonverbal side of persuasion.

If you want to go deeper without reading every book cover to cover, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by folks from Columbia and Google that pulls from rhetoric books, debate research, and expert talks to create personalized audio content.

You type in something like ""master persuasive communication as an introvert"" and it builds a structured learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The depth control is clutch when you're commuting or at the gym. Plus you can pick different voices, I went with the sarcastic style which makes complex persuasion psychology way more digestible. Makes fitting learning into your actual life pretty seamless.

**Learn to weaponize agreement**

This one's from negotiation psychology. When someone makes a point you disagree with, start with ""you're absolutely right that..."" then add a ""and"" statement that redirects. Never use ""but"" because it negates everything before it. ""You're right that costs are a concern, AND that's exactly why this investment pays for itself"" hits different than ""You're right BUT actually...""

The ""and"" technique makes people feel heard while you completely change the direction. It's collaborative framing for what's actually a disagreement.

Real talk though, the biggest shift for me was realizing that being ""right"" doesn't matter if you can't communicate effectively. Facts without persuasion just make you the person everyone avoids at parties. Understanding the psychology behind how humans process arguments, how our brains take shortcuts, how status and framing work, that's what actually moves people.

Also the app Elevate has these brain training games for verbal reasoning and processing speed that lowkey helped me think faster on my feet during debates. Not sponsored, just genuinely useful for keeping your mind sharp.

The whole point isn't to manipulate people or ""win"" for ego. It's about having the tools to advocate effectively for ideas you believe in, to stand your ground when it matters, and to actually change minds instead of just yelling into the void. Learn the psychology, practice the techniques, and you'll never feel powerless in a debate again.",1,1771012660.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
1r3zcdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobhunting/comments/1r3zcdv/interviewed_today_with_a_coffee_company_worst/,"Interviewed Today with a Coffee Company, Worst Interview I’ve EVER Had","So a couple of days ago, I had posted about having an in person interview scheduled for today, and how I was very on the hook about it. I had a phone interview previously for this company and they mentioned that if I was selected that I would have to sign a 5 year non-compete clause (insane), and I was very suspicious about it and turned to this sub for some advice. Well, I just got home from my interview, and I think I dodged a MAJOR bullet.

First off, the lady I was interviewing with—we’ll call her Jane (not her real name)—was 10 minutes late. The interview was scheduled for 11 AM, I arrived at 10:50, and she arrived around 11:10. We shook hands, and I started the interview. Jane began asking me questions about my past jobs, and why I labeled them on the application as “do not contact.” She would not accept one answer, and kept grilling me as to why I left those positions. Once we moved on from this, she began asking me normal interview questions, such as how I handled a difficult situation or customer and how I resolved it, but she kept asking unnecessary and frankly personal questions. One of them was “Did you ever have a favorite customer at any of your jobs?”, and when I responded, she asked me “What was their name?” like I was lying, so I made up a name. When I wouldn’t give her a straight answer on any other personal questions, I could tell she was judging me HARD. She kept prying and prying, and honestly I felt she saw me as a child that couldn’t be trusted.

One thing I noticed was how she reacted to my answers. As I was talking, she would nod her head slowly and close her eyes, but not in a friendly way. Think of a popular girl in school not caring what you have to say and believing she was above you. It felt very patronizing, as if she was judging my every move and not actually listening to what I had to say. She was very vindictive with her responses to my answers, and generally just acted like I was inconveniencing her with them. 

I ended up not getting the job. I saw it coming from a mile away just by how Jane acted alone, but if I’m being honest, I wouldn’t have accepted a job offer from her because of how she acted during our interview and due to her lateness. I was VERY tempted to leave mid-interview because of her behavior. Another thing I noted is how she did not ask me if I had any questions for her. I so badly wanted to ask why she had a 5 year non-compete clause set in place for her employees, even though it’s not legally binding in my state.

Overall, I think I dodged a huge bullet. Just wanted to share my story and see what you guys think!😋

TL;DR: Interviewed with a patronizing, catty woman, didn’t get the job but it’s probably for the better.",1,1771012569.0,jobhunting,1,0.67,False
1r3zcar,https://i.redd.it/7lhbvn5ghbjg1.png,"I got tired of productivity apps feeling like data entry jobs, so I built a day planner that actually works.","Hey everyone 👋🏻,

I’ve tried almost every productivity app out there. The cycle is always the same: download it, spend hours setting it up, and then abandon it a week (most of the times say day), later coz logging tasks feels like a second job.

I realized I had a few specific problems that no single app was solving for me:

\- I couldn't visualize my day. List views are boring and calendar blocks are rigid. I wanted to see my day at a glance.

\- Logging tasks is a friction point. I don't want to tap 5 buttons to add ""Buy milk.""

\- I kept missing things. Tasks would get buried in sub-menus or different days.

\- Context was missing. I’d plan a huge outdoor run only to realize it’s raining.

So I built Pala to fix this. Here is how it solves those issues:

1. The Circular Timeline

I built a custom view (CircularTimeline) that visualizes your entire day on a 24-hour clock face. You can see your free slots, overlaps, and current status in one single, friendly view. It handles task overlaps intelligently so you can see when you're overbooked without it looking cluttered.  You can see that screen in the ScreenShot #1

2. AI Planning (To avoid  manual logging)

I added an AI feature where you just dump your brain. Type ""I need to finish the report, go to the gym at 5, and call mom"", even you can do it for future like ""Plan my weekends and make them health centric and some entertainment'. The app understands that text and plans your day for you automatically. It’s the feature that finally stopped me from avoiding task logging.

3. Never Miss a Task

I created a dedicated home view that combines the timeline with a smart list. It’s designed so nothing slips through the cracks—you can manage, reschedule, or complete tasks right from the dashboard. Or simply ask AI feature to plan all the missed tasks to my current day.

4. Context-Aware Calendar

The calendar doesn't just show dots for events; it pulls in real weather data. Now when I plan my week, I can see if it’s going to rain on Tuesday before I schedule that hike.

5. True Focus Mode

To stop getting distracted, I built a dedicated Focus Mode. It’s a clean, full-screen timer that tracks your progress and blocks out the noise so you can actually get work done.

6. Productivity Insights

Finally, I wanted to know if I was actually improving. The app tracks your completion rates and gives you detailed insights into your productivity trends over time.

I built this because I needed it, but I’d love to hear what you think.

1r3zbum,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1r3zbum/yapparino_on_most_recent_video/,Yapparino on Most Recent Video,"I am typically a lurker. I am one of the annoying lefties and wanted to discuss the preemptive blue no matter who. I have been BNMW while advocating for my guys in the primaries. But do think that 2028 is different. I assume Atrioc brought it up due to the Hasan 'drama' that is circulating, but I have seen some discussion on the issue and figured the more liberal Atrioc community would disagree, but not be insane about this line of thinking.

My understanding of Atrioc's statements is that we should encourage a competative primary, but whoever wins the Dem primary ought to be supported for president, that even a centrist dem may not be great, but bad is better than worse, and we shouldn't let perfect be the enemy of good. I disagree, not because those statements are incorrect, but because I believe short term harm is being expressed as overall harm.

If we elect another feckless, do-nothing democrat who fails to meaningfully address major issues like income inequality, housing, education, debt crisis, healthcare, etc, , i.e. Newsome/Harris/Buttigeg (Pete is marginally better), I argue that will cause a dissillusionment with democracy that will lead to harm so much greater than if J.D. Vance squeaks out a win and is functionally a lame duck president who Republicans can jump off the sinking ship without the same reprocussions if they did so with Trump.

I think we can see this in the 2020 Biden election. Yes, Biden he did some good things (Lina Khan the GOAT), but Biden getting elected in 2020 allowed Trump to cause more damage in his 2nd term than if he were to be reelected. Biden's & Merrick Garland's refusal to prosecute Trump for the election stealing attempt, release of the Epstein files, and his insistance to run again caused a greater Trump harm than ever. Purely using hindsight, Trump 2020 was the greater harm reduction vote. 

I understand where his thoughts are, as I was upset when Bernie got jumped in the primary, but support Biden as VBNW. Honestly, he was better than I thought he would be, but he didn't commit to liberal values by protecting democracy against Trump, and realy only made marginal corrections in a time where he should have at least gestured to transformative policy.

Atrioc is constantly fighting nihilism and doomerism that he sees in politics today, and I agree. But if progressives get rat fucked AGAIN, it is obvious to me that young people will not be nearly forever locked in that unproductive state of mind where nothing ever changes if nothing changes this time around. If after trying to steal an election, flagarently scamming the nation, causing huge economic pain, and protecting/being pedophiles doesn't cause the opposition party to meaningfully go after you, then what does cause things to happen?

Yes, a corporate democrat will be better on issues, we may see some housing credits, or an extra FTC lawsuit. Yet the continued marginalization of oppressed people and economic mismanagement under Vance would be less damanging then the destruction of American democracy that would occur if a corporate democrat fails to meaningfully address the unease Americans feel in the system for the 1246738204th time in nearly 2 decades.

I would like to hear some thought, but just wanted to share that I do not think it is a simple as ""Who has worse positions: Gavin Newsome or JD Vance?"", at least, not anymore. I doubt I can bring myself to vote for Newsome, but obviously we are ways out from that so maybe this isn't even important. I just hope that by 2028 the Dems finally give us a candidate we can vote FOR, not just someone we vote AGAINST.

TL;DR: I believe that a Newsome election would cause so much disillusionment with American democracy that the harm of him getting elected could be worse than JD Vance. This was the case with Biden 2020, if we repeat those mistakes we may incur a collapse in the system that will take our lifetimes to fix. Even if you do not believe that is true, it is clear that the question is not a simple as ""Vote Blue no Matter Who"" anymore. There is some discussion to be had that I believe is being stamped down rn.

    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
    Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
    Ooh, black and yellow!
    Let's shake it up a little.
    Barry! Breakfast is ready!
    Coming!
    Hang on a second.
    Hello?
    Barry?
    Adam?
    Can you believe this is happening?
    I can't.
    I'll pick you up.
    Looking sharp.
    Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
    Sorry. I'm excited.
    Here's the graduate.
    We're very proud of you, son.
    A perfect report card, all B's.
    Very proud.
    Ma! I got a thing going here.
    You got lint on your fuzz.
    Ow! That's me!
    Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
    Bye!
    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
    Hey, Adam.
    Hey, Barry.
    Is that fuzz gel?
    A little. Special day, graduation.
    Never thought I'd make it.
    Three days grade school, three days high school.
    Those were awkward.
    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
    You did come back different.
    Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
    Hear about Frankie?
    Yeah.
    You going to the funeral?
    No, I'm not going.
    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
    Don't waste it on a squirrel.
    Such a hothead.
    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
    That's why we don't need vacations.
    Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
    Well, Adam, today we are men.
    We are!
    Bee-men.
    Amen!
    Hallelujah!
    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
    Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
    That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
    Will we pick our job today?
    I heard it's just orientation.
    Heads up! Here we go.
    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
    Wonder what it'll be like?
    A little scary.
    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
    This is it!
    Wow.
    Wow.
    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
    Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
    That girl was hot.
    She's my cousin!
    She is?
    Yes, we're all cousins.
    Right. You're right.
    At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
    What do you think he makes?
    Not enough.
    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
    What does that do?
    Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
    Saves us millions.
    Can anyone work on the Krelman?
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
    But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
    But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
    What's the difference?
    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you'll just work us to death?
    We'll sure try.
    Wow! That blew my mind!
    ""What's the difference?""
    How can you say that?
    One job forever?
    That's an insane choice to have to make.
    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
    Why would you question anything? We're bees.
    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
    Like what? Give me one example.
    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
    Wait a second. Check it out.
    Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
    Wow.
    I've never seen them this close.
    They know what it's like outside The Hive.
    Yeah, but some don't come back.
    Hey, Jocks!
    Hi, Jocks!
    You guys did great!
    You're monsters!
    You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
    I wonder where they were.
    I don't know.
    Their day's not planned.
    Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
    You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
    Right.
    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
    It's just a status symbol.
    Bees make too much of it.
    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies?
    Aren't they our cousins too?
    Distant. Distant.
    Look at these two.
    Couple of Hive Harrys.
    Let's have fun with them.
    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
    Oh, my!
    I never thought I'd knock him out.
    What were you doing during this?
    Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that.
    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
    Yeah. Gusty.
    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
    Six miles, huh?
    Barry!
    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
    Maybe I am.
    You are not!
    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
    What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough?
    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
    Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me.
    You decide what you're interested in?
    Well, there's a lot of choices.
    But you only get one.
    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
    Son, let me tell you about stirring.
    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
    You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It's a beautiful thing.
    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
    Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
    I'm not trying to be funny.
    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    You're gonna be a stirrer?
    No one's listening to me!
    Wait till you see the sticks I have.
    I could say anything right now.
    I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let's open some honey and celebrate!
    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
    I'm so proud.
    We're starting work today!
    Today's the day.
    Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
    Yeah, right.
    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
    Is it still available?
    Hang on. Two left!
    One of them's yours! Congratulations!
    Step to the side.
    What'd you get?
    Picking crud out. Stellar!
    Wow!
    Couple of newbies?
    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
    Make your choice.
    You want to go first?
    No, you go.
    Oh, my. What's available?
    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
    Any chance of getting the Krelman?
    Sure, you're on.
    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
    Wax monkey's always open.
    The Krelman opened up again.
    What happened?
    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
    Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
    Oh, this is so hard!
    Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
    Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
    Barry!
    All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
    What happened to you?
    Where are you?
    I'm going out.
    Out? Out where?
    Out there.
    Oh, no!
    I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
    You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
    Another call coming in.
    If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
    Hey, guys.
    Look at that.
    Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
    It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
    Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
    Sign here, here. Just initial that.
    Thank you.
    OK.
    You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
    So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
    Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
    Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
    That's awful.
    And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
     All right, launch positions!
    Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
    Black and yellow!
    Hello!
    You ready for this, hot shot?
    Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
    Wind, check.
    Antennae, check.
    Nectar pack, check.
    Wings, check.
    Stinger, check.
    Scared out of my shorts, check.
    OK, ladies,
    let's move it out!
    Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
    All of you, drain those flowers!
    Wow! I'm out!
    I can't believe I'm out!
    So blue.
    I feel so fast and free!
    Box kite!
    Wow!
    Flowers!
    This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
    Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
    Roses!
    30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
    Stand to the side, kid.
    It's got a bit of a kick.
    That is one nectar collector!
    Ever see pollination up close?
    No, sir.
    I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
    See that? It's a little bit of magic.
    That's amazing. Why do we do that?
    That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
    Cool.
    I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
    Copy that visual.
    Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
    Affirmative.
    That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it?
    I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
    It smells good.
    Not like a flower, but I like it.
    Yeah, fuzzy.
    Chemical-y.
    Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
    My sweet lord of bees!
    Candy-brain, get off there!
    Problem!
    Guys!
    This could be bad.
    Affirmative.
    Very close.
    Gonna hurt.
    Mama's little boy.
    You are way out of position, rookie!
    Coming in at you like a missile!
    Help me!
    I don't think these are flowers.
    Should we tell him?
    I think he knows.
    What is this?!
    Match point!
    You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
    Yowser!
    Gross.
    There's a bee in the car!
    Do something!
    I'm driving!
    Hi, bee.
    He's back here!
    He's going to sting me!
    Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
    He blinked!
    Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?!
    Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
    I gotta get home.
    Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
    Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Ken, could you close the window please?
    Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
    Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
    What was that?
    Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
    That is diabolical.
    It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
    What's number one? Star Wars?
    Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
    When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
    I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
    I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
    Wait! Stop! Bee!
    Stand back. These are winter boots.
    Wait!
    Don't kill him!
    You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
    Why does his life have less value than yours?
    Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
    I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
    My brochure!
    There you go, little guy.
    I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
     Put that on your resume brochure.
    My whole face could puff up.
    Make it one of your special skills.
    Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
    Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
    You could put carob chips on there.
    Bye.
    Supposed to be less calories.
    Bye.
    I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
    All right, here it goes.
    Nah.
    What would I say?
    I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
    I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
    Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
    No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
    How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
    Hi!
    I'm sorry. You're talking.
    Yes, I know.
    You're talking!
    I'm so sorry.
    No, it's OK. It's fine.
    I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
    Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
    This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
    I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
    And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
    That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
    Yeah.
    I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
    I just want to say I'm grateful.
    I'll leave now.
    Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    What?
    The talking thing.
    Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
    That's very funny.
    Yeah.
    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
    Anyway... Can I... get you something?
    Like what?
    I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
    I don't want to put you out.
    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
    It's just coffee.
    I hate to impose.
    Don't be ridiculous!
    Actually, I would love a cup.
    Hey, you want rum cake?
    I shouldn't.
    Have some.
    No, I can't.
    Come on!
    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
    Where?
    These stripes don't help.
    You look great!
    I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
    Are you all right?
    No.
    He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
    He finally gets there.
    He runs up the steps into the church.
    The wedding is on.
    And he says, ""Watermelon?
    I thought you said Guatemalan.
    Why would I marry a watermelon?""
    Is that a bee joke?
    That's the kind of stuff we do.
    Yeah, different.
    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
    About work? I don't know.
    I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
    I know how you feel.
    You do?
    Sure.
    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
    Really?
    My only interest is flowers.
    Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
    Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
    You're in Sheep Meadow!
    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
    No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
    Why do girls put rings on their toes?
    Why not?
    It's like putting a hat on your knee.
    Maybe I'll try that.
    You all right, ma'am?
    Oh, yeah. Fine.
    Just having two cups of coffee!
    Anyway, this has been great.
    Thanks for the coffee.
    Yeah, it's no trouble.
    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
    Are you...?
    Can I take a piece of this with me?
    Sure! Here, have a crumb.
    Thanks!
    Yeah.
    All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
    OK, Barry.
    And thank you so much again... for before.
    Oh, that? That was nothing.
    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
    This can't possibly work.
    He's all set to go.
    We may as well try it.
    OK, Dave, pull the chute.
    Sounds amazing.
    It was amazing!
    It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
    Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
    Giant, scary humans!
    What were they like?
    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
    They eat crazy giant things.
    They drive crazy.
    Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
    Some of them. But some of them don't.
    How'd you get back?
    Poodle.
    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
    You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
    Well...
    Well?
    Well, I met someone.
    You did? Was she Bee-ish?
    A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
    No, no, no, not a wasp.
    Spider?
    I'm not attracted to spiders.
    I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
    So who is she?
    She's... human.
    No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
    Her name's Vanessa.
    Oh, boy.
    She's so nice. And she's a florist!
    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
    We're not dating.
    You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
    She saved my life! And she understands me.
    This is over!
    Eat this.
    This is not over! What was that?
    They call it a crumb.
    It was so stingin' stripey!
    And that's not what they eat.
    That's what falls off what they eat!
    You know what a Cinnabon is?
    No.
    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
    Sit down!
    ...really hot!
    Listen to me!
    We are not them! We're us.
    There's us and there's them!
    Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
    There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
    You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee.
    Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    There he is. He's in the pool.
    You know what your problem is, Barry?
    I gotta start thinking bee?
    How much longer will this go on?
    It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
    I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
    What life? You have no life!
    You have no job. You're barely a bee!
    Would it kill you to make a little honey?
    Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
    Martin, would you talk to him?
    Barry, I'm talking to you!
    You coming?
    Got everything?
    All set!
    Go ahead. I'll catch up.
    Don't be too long.
    Watch this!
    Vanessa!
    We're still here.
    I told you not to yell at him.
    He doesn't respond to yelling!
    Then why yell at me?
    Because you don't listen!
    I'm not listening to this.
    Sorry, I've gotta go.
    Where are you going?
    I'm meeting a friend.
    A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
    Bye.
    I just hope she's Bee-ish.
    They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
    To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
    Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
    A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
    No. All right, I've got one.
    How come you don't fly everywhere?
    It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
    Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
    All right, your turn.
    TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
    You don't have that?
    We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
    Oh, my.
    Dumb bees!
    You must want to sting all those jerks.
    We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
    So you have to watch your temper.
    Very carefully.
    You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
    Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
    Yeah.
    What is wrong with you?!
    It's a bug.
    He's not bothering anybody.
    Get out of here, you creep!
    What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
    Yeah, it was. How did you know?
    It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
    You've really got that down to a science.
    I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
    I'll bet.
    What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
    How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
    Is he that actor?
    I never heard of him.
    Why is this here?
    For people. We eat it.
    You don't have enough food of your own?
    Well, yes.
    How do you get it?
    Bees make it.
    I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
    There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
    It's organic.
    It's our-ganic!
    It's just honey, Barry.
    Just what?!
    Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
    You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
    And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
    I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
    Hey, Hector. You almost done?
    Almost.
    He is here. I sense it.
    Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
    You're busted, box boy!
    I knew I heard something.
    So you can talk!
    I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
    Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
    I don't understand.
    I thought we were friends.
    The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
    You're too late! It's ours now!
    You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
    You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
    Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
    Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
    Crazy person!
    What horrible thing has happened here?
    These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
    they're on the road to nowhere!
    Just keep still.
    What? You're not dead?
    Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
    To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
    I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
    I'm going to Tacoma.
    And you?
    He really is dead.
    All right.
    Uh-oh!
    What is that?!
    Oh, no!
    A wiper! Triple blade!
    Triple blade?
    Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
    Why does everything have
    to be so doggone clean?!
    How much do you people need to see?!
    Open your eyes!
    Stick your head out the window!
    From NPR News in Washington,
    I'm Carl Kasell.
    But don't kill no more bugs!
    Bee!
    Moose blood guy!!
    You hear something?
    Like what?
    Like tiny screaming.
    Turn off the radio.
    Whassup, bee boy?
    Hey, Blood.
    Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
    Wow!
    I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
    Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
    It's a close community.
    Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
    What if you get in trouble?
    You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
    At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
    Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
    You got to be kidding me!
    Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
    Hey, guys!
    Mooseblood!
    I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
    Did you bring your crazy straw?
    We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
    What is this place?
    A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
    They are pinheads!
    Pinhead.
    Check out the new smoker.
    Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
    Smoker?
    Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
    They make the honey, and we make the money.
    ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?
    Oh, my!
    What's going on? Are you OK?
    Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
    Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
    Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
    This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
    What is this?
    Oh, no!
    There's hundreds of them!
    Bee honey.
    Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
    This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
    Oh, Barry, stop.
    Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
    Do these look like rumors?
    That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
    He's been talking to humans.
    What? Talking to humans?!
    He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
    Make out? Barry!
    We do not.
    You wish you could.
    Whose side are you on?
    The bees!
    I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
    Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
    Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
    your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
    I remember that.
    What right do they have to our honey?
    We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
    Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
    Sting them where it really hurts.
    In the face! The eye!
    That would hurt.
    No.
    Up the nose? That's a killer.
    There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
    Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.
    No more bee beards!
    With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.
    Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
    And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
    A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
    Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
    Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
    Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?
    Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
    What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
    Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
    We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
    How old are you?
    The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
    You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.

Chapter 2","https://preview.redd.it/8mzvpmangbjg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=65c1dbd4bcba4f2230b5ef5490ef6f27ec6c14a2

>This created a competitive advantage. As a result, from the 1990s to the 2010s, this situation persisted for almost 20 years, as Soviet-made aircraft were highly sought after.

Especially for large-scale transportation: construction equipment, mining equipment, and even transportation of weapons — it was such a unique experience.

**— Who were your first clients? Who was interested in this offer?**

— The first client was a Belgian brokerage company. They rented two Il-76s from us. We flew in on the first plane, but it wasn't fully prepared, so we spent about a week or ten days in Brussels before continuing our journey to Luanda. The plane was leased to this company, which already had a contract with the local authorities, and we provided transportation within the country.

**— Was there any particular feature of air transport in Africa? Perhaps a lack of developed logistics on the ground, such as railways?**

— Yes, of course. At the time, the Angolan government was unable to supply its garrisons by road due to the civil war. Air transport was often the only option. The same is true in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the road network has deteriorated over the past 50 to 70 years. The only connection between the west and the east of the country, between Kinshasa and Goma, is by air. I have to carry almost everything, because the cargo is unlikely to reach its destination, and if it does, it will take a very long time.

**— You have a long history of partnership with the UN, with various UN contingents, and as far as I know, your airline played a role in stopping the genocide in Rwanda.**

— Yes, in 1994, when we were present on the charter market in Europe, we received a very urgent request to transport a military contingent from France to the Rwanda region. At that time, we were transporting everyone to Kisangani, as it was dangerous to fly closer. We took a military unit, and for almost two months, we were transporting five to six Ruslan aircraft every day. It was a very large contract. We transported military contingents from military bases in France, especially French peacekeepers who were on a mission to stop this genocide.

https://preview.redd.it/7ne7rutpgbjg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9fd1ce7bc7eb537519580bcedfc27c6ae70d4af

Again, the whole genocide story — it was provoked. The Belgian battalion that was in Rwanda didn't intervene. When we were in Kigali later, we saw the genocide happening.

>Imagine a huge barn filled with skulls. The history of the Rwandan genocide is a reminder of Nazism: such hatred towards one's own people.

**- To the neighbors.**

— It wasn't just the neighbors; they all spoke the same language. The difference was that the Hutus were traditionally farmers, shorter in stature, while the Tutsis were pastoralists and taller due to their protein-rich diet. But they all spoke the same language and lived together.

How could the population be driven to such a state? How could this be exploited to the point where people took machetes and went out—not some Nazi squads like Azov\*, but the general population—to kill their neighbors en masse? About a million people were killed in a short period of time.

>Apparently, Rwanda was the first test base where the West practiced its technologies: how to pit nations against each other, what kind of information campaign is needed, and how to incite hatred. And then we see that this experience gained during the genocide in 1994 was used later, including in Ukraine.

**— Did you meet Paul Kagame, the current leader of Rwanda?**

— Yes, we met. But not then — it was a little later, in 1997.

**— Did he know about your involvement in the peacekeepers' deployment?**

— No. At the time, Paul Kagame was leading self-defense units of Tutsi refugees who were in Uganda and who entered Rwanda and stopped the genocide. It was not the French peacekeepers who stopped it, but these armed groups of refugees from Uganda.

There weren't many of them, and they were almost committing a suicide mission, knowing that they probably wouldn't return. However, they managed to quickly capture the capital, stop this endless crime, and stabilize the situation.

**— Under what circumstances did you meet?**

— Later. Back in 1997-98, when the DR Congo was in the midst of a rebellion against the Kabila government, we met with Kagame.

**— You mentioned earlier that you started having problems with Western intelligence agencies when you crossed paths with a British business that was working in the same niche as you.**

— This is probably not so much a British business as it is a Western intelligence agency. At the time, I had acquired an airline in South Africa, and we were working very actively, mainly transporting products for mining companies in the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), and Angola. This caused discontent among local carriers. They made sure that when our visas expired, our staff's visas were not renewed. There were also attempts to recruit us: since we carried out a lot of transportation for various African governments — Rwanda, Angola, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic — they wanted to know what we were taking and where.

**— Let's go back a little: these companies — how local were they? Were they controlled by European capital?**

— In the case of South Africa, it was a local company that just looked at the statistics: we were transporting 200 tons per day from a former military base in the northern province. Some of them thought they could transport this cargo somewhere. Without understanding the situation, they decided to make our lives difficult. And when we left, no one else was willing to transport it.

As a result, local farmers and food producers have lost the opportunity to supply goods to the foreign market — the same 200 tons per day.

**— So by the end of the 1990s, you had established a significant presence in this market?**

— At the same time, we were actively operating in 1996 and 1997 from the United Arab Emirates, from Sharjah. We had very active charter flights throughout Africa, as well as to Afghanistan. For example, in 1997, we became the second-largest cargo airline at Sharjah Airport after Lufthansa.

**— Afghanistan is a separate story, of course, but today we will focus on Africa. You mentioned that Western intelligence agencies wanted to get information. It seems to bother them that a Russian airline — essentially with Russian roots — is not under their control. African governments can negotiate among themselves and transport what they consider necessary to whomever they want, however they want. In any other situation, airlines with ties to Western capital would be sources of information for intelligence agencies.**

— Yes, of course. This was probably the main reason for the harassment, the creation of the myth about me, and the demonization of my company.

>The West has always said that Africa is a resource trove that they will leave for later. And if someone tries to start something there without their permission, they will immediately stage coups, change governments, and create zones of chaos.

The African population is just temporary tenants in a territory that actually belongs to the globalists. “You can stay here for now, but when we need you, we’ll either remove you or kill you, because we need your resources.” The same approach is applied to Russia. For the West, we are just a resource base. Russia has a vast territory, but its wealth doesn’t belong to it. “Let's create a scenario: we'll install controlled regimes, export resources, and let the population live in poverty. If necessary, we'll create wars to keep people busy with survival rather than developing their country and extracting minerals.”

**— In this sense, there are very clear parallels. Tell us a little more about the pressure you faced in South Africa in the late 1990s. I know that there was an attack on your home and offers of cooperation from unnamed organizations.**

— Yes, there was indeed an attack and robbery when the bandits broke into the house. My wife and I were in the house across the street, where the office was located. When we arrived, the child was already tied up. The bandits took away the cameras and tried to seize the computers and phones. This was the most important thing for them.

It was quite strange, because the area was in the suburbs of Johannesburg and was traditionally quite well-guarded. Naturally, such an attack would hardly have been organized by ordinary bandits. It was a well-planned operation by Western intelligence agencies. After that, of course, we had to draw some conclusions.

https://preview.redd.it/5pgcie6xgbjg1.png?width=3204&format=png&auto=webp&s=4350b04574a31475613e5b885c4708210d511217

There were still attempts to attack. At the time, there was a huge wave of crime in Johannesburg, where it was possible to stop any car at a crossroads and rob it, or even shoot the person inside to steal their watch. It was not a safe place to be in South Africa, where the country was in complete chaos and the government was unwilling to enforce order.

And the reasons for this lawlessness were clear: at the time when the African National Congress (ANC) came to power, about 4-5 million black people were unemployed in Johannesburg alone. Just like that. Naturally, over the course of 3-4 years, people who had lost their jobs were looking for any way to feed themselves.

**— And you had to leave South Africa under these circumstances?**

— Yes, I had to leave because we couldn't extend the visas for all our employees.

>Again, there was a very negative policy of accusing us of illegal transportation, even though all the flights we operated were checked by both the local customs and the police, including with dogs, and all the documents were in order.

But, as usual, the harassment began: ""They're carrying some kind of weapon at night!"" What kind of weapon could we be carrying if all flights are checked by customs?

— **Let's take a closer look at this myth. What was the most profitable transportation at the time?**

— We mainly transported food from South Africa, because all the mining companies ordered from us every day: frozen chickens, fresh vegetables, potatoes, and beets — things that don't grow in Central Africa, but were well-produced and of high quality in South Africa, as well as eggs. It was a basic grocery set. We mainly transported these items, as our business model involved offering a price for the products along with our transportation services, which was highly profitable.

Plus, we've already transported some mining equipment from South Africa on separate charter requests. Sometimes it was a series of flights. We've also transported elephants from South Africa to Angola, for example.

**— Why does Angola need elephants?**

— After the active phase of the war in Angola ended, there was an overpopulation of elephants in South Africa. They decided to transport the excess elephants to Angola. During the civil war, elephants were the first to suffer, as you can imagine, if you shoot an elephant, it would be enough to feed almost a thousand people for several days. Naturally, the number of elephants decreased significantly. As a result, South Africa transferred the excess elephants to neighboring countries for a long time.

https://preview.redd.it/khbpeeczgbjg1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=342e17baa382f2e7fc0fce5b7805777618a2b965

We also transported ostriches from South Africa to Saudi Arabia. There was an interesting incident. We loaded boxes of eggs, boxes of chicks, and special stalls were made for the adult birds. It was a whole tribe, with several males and many females.

The cages for adult ostriches, which are large birds, were made of wood and plywood. The workers had to carry the ostriches from the trucks to the cages. The females were loaded, but the males were more difficult to handle. They were stubborn and managed to escape.

>As a result, several ostriches ran around Johannesburg Airport for a long time. This caused the airport to be closed for several hours, as security vehicles raced around the airport grounds trying to catch them. There have been incidents like this in the past

**— Your demonization in the West began during the preparation of UN sanctions on Liberia. How was this mechanism set up?**

—The story in Liberia was as follows. We were already present almost everywhere, and it seems that the British were already preparing for a future confrontation with Russia. They chose me as a target because I was a well-known figure in Africa and did not hide from anyone. Many people still remember my name there.

They decided that if it was about Liberia, then I was supposedly involved with the so-called ""blood diamonds."" And there was a certain figure there, Johan Peleman, who was the head of the ""Peace Institute"" in Antwerp. This institute existed at the expense of the diamond companies, and its task was to prevent the appearance of diamonds mined by prospectors on the market, bypassing the large conglomerates. This allowed to maintain a monopoly and not to lower prices.

It was then that the “blood diamonds” campaign was launched, allegedly mined during the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Then came the book \[by Douglas Farah and Stephen Brown\] “The Death Merchant,” followed by the Hollywood film adaptation. This is how the demonization was formed.

**— And there's a character who supposedly meets with a character portraying Charles Taylor, a madman, on your behalf.**

— However, I have never met Charles Taylor in real life. Yes, I have visited Liberia, and I had a company registered there. But this was before Taylor came to power.

During this period, he was, by the way, recruited by the CIA — a U.S. agent who was actually “pulled out” by the Americans. He was in the United States and engaged in obscure activities there, and then led a rebel movement that seized power and committed the crimes for which he was later accused.

—**He's off the chain.**

— Well, as is often the case. The Americans themselves “raise” their future villains from among their own henchmen. We have seen this in the case of Al-Qaeda\* and in other cases.

**— Do I understand correctly that it was your influence on the air transportation market — the very presence of an independent player — that was the main reason for the persecution?**

— In difficult situations, we have always helped the governments of African countries to carry out important transportation for them, whether it was the delivery of weapons when necessary or other tasks.

>This is probably the main reason for the demonization and the creation of the myth of the ""arms baron,"" without whose permission no plane can take off in Africa.

**— Maybe they didn't want planes to take off in Africa without permission from the US Embassy.**

— You see, it's impossible to deceive everyone for a very long time. We see how these myths dissipate over time, like morning fog: the sun comes out, and everything falls into place.

>I think that both Africa and other regions already understand the essence of the so-called “collective West,” which has been talking about democracy, development, the rule of law, and freedom for many years. But in practice, it all ends with, excuse me, outright fascism, classic colonialism, and even more severe exploitation of people than before.

—  **You haven't visited the United States before your arrest, only within the prison system.**

—  No, I haven't been to the United States before my arrest. I've only been to Canada once, which is the closest thing I've got.

**— So you only looked at the inside of the United States?**

— It is often said that prison is the quintessence of society, its reflection. In this sense, prison does provide insight into what society is like. My interactions with my fellow inmates have been a journey into the heart of America, a place that is not visible from afar and cannot be fully understood by limited visits to Miami, New York, or Los Angeles.

**— I've heard that African Americans treat Russians differently from other whites. When talking about racial segregation in American prisons, they often mention that Russians don't fit in. Is this a myth?**

— To a certain extent, yes. I spent most of my sentence, almost 12 years, in a special unit for political prisoners and particularly dangerous criminals, where there were very few of us. But I spent about three years, or a little less, in the general population at USP Marion in Illinois.

https://preview.redd.it/w3bwmwx2hbjg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c32025bc27bfbbd826d54f3170bccb1f7795170

And it's clear how segregation works there. For example, in the dining hall, where about 1,200 people eat almost simultaneously. Black people sit separately, Latin Americans sit separately, Native Americans sit separately, and whites sit separately. There is also an internal hierarchy: those convicted of sexual crimes and sexual minorities sit separately, while ""regular"" people sit separately.

The African-American population, in my opinion, really thinks differently. Unfortunately, most of them, especially those from major cities like Washington and others, have a poor understanding of their history. Typically, they don't know their fathers and are victims of the destruction of the traditional family, which has been happening in America since the 1950s, when a kind of experiment was conducted to control the black, traditional, and conservative population through the erosion of the family institution.

As a result, today more than 90% of the black population lives outside the traditional family model. Often, one family has five or six children from different fathers whom they have never met. This environment creates a different mindset.

There are also those who have managed to preserve the traditions, and their attitude towards us is really different. Unfortunately, most people know very little. According to my observations, about 60-70% of them are functionally illiterate, unable to read despite having completed seven or eight years of schooling.

Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that one of the key functions of a prison is to at least teach people to read and write.

**— It sounds quite gloomy. Do you have any connections with African businesspeople or politicians now?**

— We are gradually restoring our contacts. We have old contacts, and we are making new ones. We participated in the Russia-Africa Forum in 2023 in St. Petersburg. We are also working with South Africa and other countries.

**— Share some ideas: where should Russia focus its attention, and what processes are taking place in Africa?**

— First of all, all of Africa is very interesting. For us, it is a huge potential market that would allow Russia to ensure its technological sovereignty. Moreover, for many reasons, we are the most competitive there, even compared to Chinese products. This is due to logistics and the way Africans use technology. Our technology may not be of the highest quality, but it is the most “repairable” and survivable in African conditions.

We have a lot of products that are in demand there. In addition to the traditional agro-industrial sector, which includes grain, frozen meat, processed foods, and flour, we also export construction materials, fertilizers, and fuel and lubricants. These are purely commercial transactions.

There is a huge field of activity in any African country. If we create conditions so that Russian companies understand, know, are not afraid, and have support — not only financial, but also administrative — so that our trade missions intervene more actively, so that businesses unite and enter the country as a group.

There are a lot of opportunities: processing, creating a food industry, and growing traditional export goods such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, cotton, jute, and tropical fruits. This would help balance trade with Africa. And of course, we are extremely competitive in the energy sector, including generating capacity, nuclear power, and mining.

>I believe that it is time for our major companies to consider joint mining operations in Africa.

**— If we're talking about countering Russia's return to Africa, you have a wealth of experience here. You're well aware of the campaigns to demonize Russia's presence. And we're witnessing it right now: the resurgence of our activities is immediately met with a barrage of myths. The main villain has been identified. Although the goal is to maintain sovereignty, people are trying to help establish security and stop outright banditry.**

— These ridiculous scare tactics don't work anymore. Moreover, we've also learned to effectively counter them. Most importantly, the Africans themselves have passed that stage: the development of the internet doesn't allow the West to simply spread rumors and chuckle behind the scenes.

Look at what's happening in France's former colonies: there's a mass exodus of the French presence. Why? Because people have realized that France hasn't been helping them develop for a long time, and it's been an unprofitable partnership. Take Niger as an example: a country that produced vast amounts of uranium was living in poverty due to the exploitative conditions imposed by the colonialists.

It's clear that African countries need to establish an independent financial system. Currently, it is tied to France, especially in former French colonies, through the CFA franc zone, a French-controlled bank, and airspace control. However, this is currently crumbling.

>Our goal is to help Africans build an independent system. This is a mutually beneficial partnership: we don't come to surround something with a fence and dig inside. Our goal is to work with African countries to help them reach a level where they can guarantee their sovereignty and develop successfully.

After all, Africa is the continent of the future. It is currently the most rapidly developing continent economically, where the middle class is growing the most. This means that consumption will grow exponentially, and there will be resources for large-scale infrastructure projects such as roads, urban development, water supply, and sewage systems. We have very good prospects here. We are open to joint ventures with African countries, which makes us the most comfortable partners for them.

**— Do you plan to return to Africa?**

""Yes, of course.

**— Despite all the problems that have been created for you, so to speak, in this American global jurisdiction?**

— I take a philosophical approach to this. Look, when have we not had problems in our history? What makes us any different from 150-200 years ago?

**""But I'm talking about you personally.""**

— This will probably be my answer to all my enemies and ill-wishers: no matter what, you guys haven't achieved what you wanted. In the words of the character from ""Brother"": ""What is the power? The power is in the truth."" As a country-civilisation, we don't just impose a world order on other nations; we approach them with respect for their culture and customs, fostering partnerships and brotherhood.

[Viktor Bout with his wife Alla](https://preview.redd.it/ssh03wd6hbjg1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f474587fc58b819d3df37449f777b38b14712359)

Because, perhaps more than any other nation, the Russian people know how to learn and understand other nations. And this has always allowed us to build absolutely unique ways of interacting with other nations in the world.

A lot will change in the next few years — in Africa especially and in the world as a whole. We will see a completely different order.

>Look: not a single African country has adopted anti-Russian sanctions. Yes, maybe not everyone voted openly at first, but now more and more countries are supporting Russia. This is the continent of maximum friendliness towards us.

[Viktor But and journalist Maxim Solopov at the African Initiative editorial office](https://preview.redd.it/xkk2n7o8hbjg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2721a1c47957c3020676e910c973a6d2243f4e6)

Yes, with its own problems, yes, with its own, let's say, deep-seated challenges. But if we understand the history of the African continent, it was divided not as a result of the historical process of forming conglomerations and nations, but simply divided like a cake, without considering either the ethnic or economic regions. Sometimes, the borders follow straight lines, almost like the states in the United States.

And we have to give credit to the Africans: they decided that if this happened, we won't reconsider it. Now, the formation of a national identity is actively taking place, which will allow Africans to make sense of all this.

Spring semester finals start Monday and I've been locked in the library for what feels like weeks. The cherry trees are in full bloom outside and I haven't seen them once because I'm buried in textbooks.

My study group has been demolishing bags of dark chocolate like it's going out of style. One friend swears by it for focus, another says it's essential for memorization. I've been eating my share but I'm getting tired of it and my stomach is starting to protest. Plus chocolate alone can't be the only answer right?

So I'm asking the smarter people here who've survived finals before: aside from chocolate, what food can help our brain during studying that actually works and won't make me feel gross?

I'm talking about real studying here. Late nights, early mornings, trying to cram centuries of history into my brain. I need every advantage I can get without spending a fortune or cooking complicated meals.

For the seasoned students and nutrition people:

aside from chocolate, what food can help our brain during studying that you've personally felt a difference with?

Are there specific snacks that help with focus versus memory versus energy without the crash?

What about drinks besides coffee? I'm caffeine sensitive and jittery already.

Any meal prep ideas for finals week that aren't just instant ramen?

Do the timing of eating matter? Like before studying versus during versus after?

Also any foods to absolutely avoid during heavy studying? I've heard sugar crashes are real.

My mother in law is a stained glass artist; she's been doing it for years so she's quite advanced. Her birthday is coming up, and I am looking for a great stained glass-related gift for her. I feel that getting her specific tools or materials might not be the best idea, since I don't know what she uses or needs (I am not a stained glass person myself, so I wouldn't know where to begin there). 

Therefore, I was thinking maybe I could get her a ""coffee table book"" or some sort of book with beautiful stained glass work in it for inspiration. One of the few recommendations I did manage to find was for the book ""Kicking Glass"". Or I thought perhaps a ""glass-of-the-month"" membership for a few months might be fun (if such a thing exists), where someone more knowledgeable than myself could choose materials for her to try out. 

As a non-newbie stained glass artist, what gift would you be glad to receive? Any specific recommendations? Thank you in advance!

I was gathering some info for someone and found my old trip report and links to some places. I thought I would share, for anyone currently planning a trip. Everyone here was so helpful when I was planning, I thought maybe this would help someone else! Happy Travels!

\*\*In the first comment, I will list all the links that correspond with my report\*\*

EDIT: I CANNOT ADD LINKS, LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT ANY.

\*\*It’s important to note – we did not rent a car and we based ourselves in Reykjavik.\*\*  
We knew it was pricier and meant more travel time, but it worked perfectly for us. We met so many nice people on every tour and we gathered a wealth of information from the tour guides, who kept us entertained on all the bus trips.  
We stayed in a charming AirBnb that was in the perfect location, walkable to everything

**MONDAY DAY 1**

After an all night flight with no sleep, we went to the Blue Lagoon - everyone who had this suggestion was right – it was a great way to relax and begin our vacation. We would have just crashed at the air bnb, and then felt crummy the rest of the day. We took a transport bus to our AirBNB in Reykjavik, got a bit settled and then headed out for the Reykjavik Food Tour (with WAKE UP REYKJAVIK), where we tried, amongst other things, fermented shark, an authentic Icelandic hot dog and rye ice cream! Our guide Haddy was AWESOME! He made the tour so much fine. I’d highly recommend this tour. All the people on the tour with us were so very nice! We made a quick stop at Bonus Grocery Store after, then crashed!

\* We had arranged a car to take us over. But that was such a hassle, the guy was late. There were definitely a lot of taxis around, I probably would have just as soon taken a taxi when I got there. And then there’s an area at the blue lagoon while they’ll hold your luggage. It’s inside a building, we felt safe about it. Then we were able to take a bus from the blue Lagoon to our accommodations.

**TUESDAY DAY 2**

After what was to become an almost daily routine, we walked to Braud & Co. (2 minutes from the house) to grab coffee (it was so good, and I am fussy with my coffee) and a pastry. And yes, the cinnamon buns are to die for! Our tour this day was with ARCTIC ADVENTURES. It was a long but pleasant bus ride (18 passengers) Our tour guide was Justin, and he did a wonderful job. He entertained us with stories and interesting facts the whole way. After a very breezy but fun ferry ride, we spent the entire day at the Westman Islands. It was a fantastic day. We saw so many puffins (yay!), Icelandic horses, houses buried from an older volcano, visited a volcano museum, Elephant Rock, along with breathtaking scenery. We had a delicious meal at a restaurant on the island before we headed home. Once again, we met the nicest people from all over the world that toured with us. Another tour I would highly recommend.

**WEDNESDAY DAY 3**

A little drizzly on and off but not near as bad as I’ve heard it could be. Did some shopping. There are great local artisans around. Then we did the most interesting and fun history tour….. The Funky Walking History Tour with FUNKY ICELAND. Lolly our tour guide (and founder of the business) was a fantastic storyteller! We saw so many great sites… a cool sculpture garden, the first school in Iceland that allowed females (I think in 1909), gorgeous flowers throughout the city, to name a few. As with the other tours, we had a great, friendly tour group. The tour was over 3 hours, and the time flew. There are a lot of cats roaming around, but all with collars and tags and all so friendly.

We ate at Skall in the Food Hall, and it was one of the best dinners I’ve ever had. It was baked cod. My one friend had the same and the other had arctic char. Both prepared amazingly well.

Spent time with the “house cat” before turning in.

**THURSDAY DAY 4**

It started off chilly and drizzly but ended up being a nice day. We were so fortunate with the weather.  
Started off at our favorite bakery before heading out to the South Coast. Our tour this day was with ARCTIC ADVENTURES. Not many (if any others) do the long trek to the South Coast and Glacier Lagoon. Because of this, it was a large bus (the only one all week). We had a female tour guide (I forget her name). She was sweet, but pretty soft spoken and didn’t have the same enthusiastic personality of all the previous guides.

We were at Stjórnarfoss and Seljalandsfoss Waterfalls. Saw amazing scenery along the way before going to Diamond Beach, which has black sand. Pieces of broken off glaciers were found on the beach. We then went to the incomparable Glacier Lagoon. One of the largest glaciers in Europe is there. We took a boat ride in the lagoon all around the icebergs that broke off from the glacier, and held a piece that they said was about 800 years old. The black parts of the glacier pieces are volcanic ash from when the glacier was formed. And the blue happens when they flip. We then saw a huge lava field with volcanic rock covered in moss. Ended the day in Vik, where we ate famous Black Crust pizza and saw the iconic white church there. One negative was we had a very short time to eat dinner….we practically had to inhale it. The tour company definitely did not figure in enough time for dinner for a busload of people.

We were all tired at the end of the day, but it was so worth it.

**FRIDAY DAY 5**

We started the day with a yummy breakfast at Sandholt Bakery. Very unique meals. And to die for hot cross buns!! We shopped around a bit after breakfast.

We then went on a tour of the Golden Circle, with a private tour guide who I found through Facebook. He was nice, but more a driver than a tour guide. He did first drive us to a knifemaker in Reykjavik (guy makes his own, message me for link).  I really appreciated the ride there. It was a great find, I bought a handmade knife for my husband, which he absolutely loved! If you are into knives, it is worth it to check it out!

This was another day of amazing nature in Iceland.

We started the tour at Thingvellir National Park. Thingvellir is one of Iceland’s three national parks. The sun was shining, and it was beautiful. The fault line is between the tectonic plates North America and Euroasia. It is a stunning park. We saw where people go snorkeling.

We went to Gullfoss Falls - it’s like a smaller Niagara Falls. Just beautiful.

We watched the Geyser Hot Springs shoot up a few times. That was pretty impressive.

We went to a horse farm and got to feed them some treats. Then went to Friðheimar tomato farm and saw how they grow tomatoes, basil and veggies in Iceland. We did not eat there, I wish we did.

Kerid Crater was phenomenal! We were so impressed with it. We hiked to the top to get a better view.

We ended the day eating at Sumac, a middle eastern restaurant. The food was so good, we didn’t even stop to take pictures!  
If I visit Iceland again, I would skip the Golden Circle, but as first time visitors, I’d recommend it.

**SATURDAY DAY 6**

My favorite day!!  
After our daily coffee and pastry run, we went on a tour to Snaefellsnes peninsula. The tour company was EAST WEST. I’d say they were the most professional and competent of all of them. Our tour guy Leroy was absolutely wonderful. So personable and knowledgeable.

The weather was perfect. Sunny all day. Though the wind did kick in a few times.

Every day we think nothing can beat the scenery of the day before. But todays was spectacular!! We were in awe.

Ytri Tunga beach is where you can sometimes see seals. We only saw a few noses stick up.

Got to pet some really pretty horses, then had a homemade lunch at the horse farm. The food was really yummy. It was so nice to share a meal with people from all over the world.

Then it was off to Mt. Kirkjufell, where parts of The Game of Thrones were filmed.

Snæfellsjökull glacier was visible from so many areas.

Black beach at Djupalonssandur was pretty cool. There are “mountains” around it, which is actually very old volcanic material. When it breaks off, it turns to pebbles and eventually coarse black sand.

Arnarstapi fishing village was mind blowing. Nature at its best.

Buðarkirkja, the black church is an iconic site in Iceland.

After we got back to Reykjavik, we ate at a small seafood restaurant (Sea Baron) on the harbor. Had lobster soup and shrimp/seafood kabobs. The food was average, not our favorite meal in Iceland.

Then we walked around town and onto Rainbow Street. The AirBnb we are staying in is central to everything.  
The Snaefellsnes tour was my favorite, and I would advise you to not miss visiting the peninsula. We were all so happy we did.

 **SUNDAY DAY 7**

Final full day in Iceland.

No touring that day. It was a gorgeous day…. 60°, sunny and brilliant blue skies. We took a nice stroll by the Harbor in the morning. We saw the Sun Voyager sculpture (it is a dream boat and an ode to the sun. It represents the promise of undiscovered territory and a dream of hope, progress and freedom).

Had fabulous sandwiches for lunch at Sandholt Bakery before heading to Sky Lagoon. It was a perfect way to spend our last day. It’s so relaxing. And invigorating! We did the 7-step ritual, which includes a cold plunge. The infinity pool was so pretty. The waterfall was fun. We all liked it better than the Blue Lagoon. (But like the Golden Circle, if it’s your first time, I’d still do the Blue Lagoon)

We had our best meal of the entire trip that evening at Sjávargrillið Seafood Grill. Started with a delicious smooth wine and the best lobster taco appetizers I’ve ever tasted. We shared 3 main dishes… salted cod, Ling cod and seafood pasta. Every bite was delicious! We couldn’t say no to dessert. We shared an amazing crème brûlée and a delectable chocolate lava cake.

**MONDAY DAY 8**

The end of a truly memorable, once in a lifetime vacation. We had the best time, and all feel truly blessed that we were able to visit Iceland together.

We finally made it to the top of Hallgrímskirkja church, which was a 5 minute walk from our house. You could see the whole city from there.

And we saw a bride and groom getting ready to get married!  
The same person who did the Golden Circle tour drove us to the airport. Our luggage was so heavy, it was better than lugging it all to a bus stop.

We arrived home tired, but full of magical, endless memories.

 

\*\* Not in the trip report, but one day for lunch, we ate at 101 Reykjavik Street Food. They had delicious fish and chips. It was Trip Advisor’s recommendation and they were correct!

How does my ""acidification"" plan sound?","I live in zone 6b - New England. Most of my garden experience is for high-desert 8b or 9b so this has been a bit of a learning curve. But my mission? BLUEBERRIES.   
  
My grandpa used to grow the most perfect blueberries to ever blueberry. We made pies and jams and had so many left over we shared buckets with neighbors. We even had a designated bush outside the chickenwire for the birds, it was so bountiful. 

I was too young to learn from my grandpa before he passed, like how blueberries need acidic soil. I spent 3 summers trying to revive his garden and figure out what I was doing wrong before a neighbor tested my soil. A ph of 8! (It explains why the hydrangeas are pink when the tag said blue -- again, I'm kinda new to this.) 

SO! My plan for when the snow melts is to dig up my soil (raised beds in a fenced/netted garden) throw everything onto a tarp and just go bananas with some hollytone, berrytone, and maybe some chicken poop, graciously offered by my neighbor. I've also heard coffee grounds would help.

But I worry, can I go overboard? I have raspberry vines that seemed to do okay last year, (not much fruit but they grew like crazy) will they suffer from too much acid? I shouldn't dig up the bushes right? Just the dirt around them? Should I get new plants and just start over (I'm pretty sure one of the blueberry bushes died last summer.) 

What about mulch? I've been using mulch to deal with weeds and onion grass that's been spreading. (Also mint. I didn't know you're not supposed to plant mint in the ground and now my life is mint)

Anyway, blueberry experts, what should I do? Does this sound like a good plan? Are there any other things I could do to help my berry garden thrive? ",4,1771012251.0,gardening,7,1.0,False

Another wonderful Canadian IMP experience! This time, a 2020 vintage, Menu 19, Beef Ravioli (in meat sauce)!

What a fantastic menu; everything from the main, to the sides, to the snacks/desserts...just wonderful!

Pics 1-3 show packaging and contents. What a spread!

Pic 4 is the iconic Pain Bun. This does not bring pain when you eat them, as they are normally quite good! In this instance, however, the bun went to doggo. Not because it was bad, but because a tax had to be paid. 

Pic 5 is the orange drink. These Canadians know their orange drinks, because this was great, without even a hint of maple syrup. 

Pic 6 is the 3 in 1 Nescafe. In this case, it was made with milk and drank ice cold for breakfast! What a wonderfully sweet and creamy beverage with a smooth coffee flavor!

Pic 7 is the apple slices. But Waffels,  why do they look like they have stigmata? Well, old waffels attempted a pro move by macerating them in the Raspberry jam overnight! Would I do it again, probably not. They tasted great but were so sweet it was almost intolerable. I much prefer these with some cinnamon sprinkled over them instead!

Pic 8 shows the beef jerky. You need every single calorie provided by this jerky just to recover from the battle of trying to get it out of the package. Seriously, if you've never done that, you have no idea. I love this jerky and it's super hard to chew texture.  A savory snack for sure!

Pic 9 shows the 2nd pro move; putting the PB directly on the Wonderbar. It's been rumored that doing this will bring good luck over the next 12 months! We shall see!

Pic 10 is a super unique ration item! Almonds with chocolate covered coffee beans! This was excellent! Sweet, crunchy, and actually quite hearty with all the almonds. At 270 kcal, definitely worth the price of admission! It's hard to type because of the jitters from all the caffeine!

Pic 11 is the main dish. A hearty bowl of beef Ravioli.  That poor Tabasco packet was harmed in the making of these Ravioli, but it went out doing what it loved, adding a fantastic spicy kick to these already delicious Ravioli.  These are far superior to US MRE beef Ravioli. 

Well, it's obvious how much I enjoyed this one today! I am thankful for the opportunity to have experienced it!

Take Care folks!

Chapter 1","https://preview.redd.it/15ec8snwbbjg1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01f917f37e6574e0c0756b76da0f9f37f4ca3f5

*Viktor But is a former military translator and the most famous Russian aviation entrepreneur in Africa. Since the late 1990s, Western media has accused him of involvement in international arms trafficking. These accusations formed the basis for the Hollywood film ""The Gun Runner."" In 2008, But was arrested in Thailand as a result of a provocation, where undercover agents from the United States lured him to Bangkok for negotiations on air transportation, claiming to be representatives of Colombian guerrillas. The fact of contact was qualified as support for terrorism and a conspiracy to murder American citizens. After 13 years in prison, But returned to Russia as part of an exchange of prisoners. In a large interview with the African Initiative, But spoke about his extensive experience on the African continent, the myths surrounding him, and Russia's prospects in Africa.*

**— Viktor Anatolyevich, I am glad to welcome you here. You are a legendary person, and you do not need an introduction. Today, we will discuss Africa in more detail than in your previous interviews. Your fate is closely tied to this continent. Can you list the African countries you have visited during your civilian and military career?**

— Africa is a truly colossal continent, and it is interesting, even magical. I began my career in the People's Republic of Mozambique. Later, after my military career, I had the opportunity to visit Angola, as well as Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Namibia. At that time, there was also Zaire, which is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as Rwanda, Tanzania, Burundi, and Somalia. I also worked in the Central African Republic. Naturally, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, the Gambia, and Senegal. And the North of Africa: Algeria, Libya, Egypt, and Sudan.

So, if you look at it that way, I haven't been to Lesotho, but I have been to the kingdom that is now called Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland). I've also visited that country. Therefore, there are only a few countries left that I haven't visited, such as Botswana, Malawi, South Sudan, and Chad.

**— When you chose your first profession, that of a military translator, did you already prepare yourself for going to Africa? Maybe when you chose Portuguese — if you chose it — or when you were young, you had an initial interest in Africa?**

— Of course, I was interested. But at the military institute where I studied in the Soviet era, they decided which language you would learn. So, almost by chance, on the very last day, after I had already been accepted, before the order was issued, I was appointed commander of the Portuguese language group. Otherwise, I probably would have studied Pashto.

**— Is it because you grew up in Central Asia?**

— Apparently, they had their own reasons.

**— But was it related to the Soviet military presence in Africa at the time?**

— Of course. I was finishing an accelerated course. There were four groups of Portuguese, four groups of Dari, and two groups of Pashto. Dari and Pashto were for Afghanistan, and Portuguese was for Angola and Mozambique, where we had large contingents of advisers at the time.

**— When did you come to Mozambique? And what role did this period play in your life? What were your first impressions?**

— It was 1988. I remember it well — it was August. We had already received our passports and special clothes: suits, shirts, ties, and shoes. Everything was Czechoslovakian — fashionable and beautiful.

**— A civilian, not in uniform?**

\- Yes, in civilian clothes, not in uniform. Tickets for the Aeroflot flight via Aden to Maputo, Il-62... it was just like in the movie. Getting from Moscow — even in summer — to Africa, you find yourself in a completely different world: different colors, a different smell. There was, of course, a certain shock — for a while. But then it became very interesting.

[The capital of Mozambique is Maputo](https://preview.redd.it/5dj2w4n0cbjg1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=a44d56ae6f7ed73ae6499b49c6efabe2c25dbb0c)

These were probably the most important years for me: it was then that I began to understand Africa as a whole, and Mozambique in particular, and became familiar with various local cultures and tribes.

I also visited different regions of Mozambique, not just the capital. Therefore, this period was truly significant and interesting for me.

**— What was the political and economic situation like at the time? What were the living conditions like?**

— Everything is known in comparison. But, nevertheless, Maputo was a fairly comfortable city. At least, where we lived: in the dormitory, the famous ""house 49"", together with a classmate. We had air conditioning, we cooked in the kitchen ourselves, walked around the city in our free time from the service. There was a beach nearby - every morning after jogging, you could swim. And, of course, the exotic: coconut palms, an interesting city, quite well-maintained.

The center of Maputo was nothing like a typical African city — there were a lot of skyscrapers. And despite the difficult situation, there were restaurants open, where you could get coffee and beer. It was quite interesting.

**— Tell us more about the political situation at the time. What were your goals?**

— The government of the People's Republic of Mozambique was fighting the rebels. The rebel movement was called RENAMO. It was supported by the Republic of South Africa and Western intelligence agencies, primarily through South Africa. Supplies were provided from there, as Mozambique shares a border with South Africa, and the main area of infiltration was along this border. The mission of the contingent and the office of the Chief Military Advisor was to assist the local armed forces in training their personnel. Therefore, in every unit, up to and including the battalion and even lower, there were our advisers: from the adviser of the brigade and regiment to the advisers of the battalions. Naturally, translators were required everywhere — they provided the process of preparation and conducting of combat operations.

[RENAMO Fighters](https://preview.redd.it/5ehlwrn4cbjg1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=95615ca05a446070147ade058f8618f8ca3c5569)

There were no open battles like the ones in Angola. Renamo's tactics in Mozambique were mainly based on ambushes, sabotage, such as cutting the power lines that supplied the capital, and provocations at the level of small towns, such as seizing food warehouses. When I was in Chokwe, in one of the combat brigades, we were involved in a small battle when the bandits tried to attack the brigade. The brigade successfully repelled the attack.

**— You were a military interpreter. How did you act during a firefight? What happened?**

— We were a group, and there was a colonel who was in charge of a group of Soviet specialists. We were all stationed together: we had several GAZ-66 vehicles, one GAZ-66-based radio station, a headquarters, and several conscripts and operators. When the shooting started, we immediately took up positions around the headquarters, as we had prepared for this. We contacted the center and the military advisor's office, reported the situation, clarified details with the brigade commander, and remained in place until the operation was completed.

[Military specialists from the USSR and Mozambique](https://preview.redd.it/xx78zb37cbjg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e308c2ddba4276febc051eb16dda87ef065fbdfd)

The locals managed to localize a group of bandits who had infiltrated the city. It turned out that their main goal was to rob a food warehouse. In the morning, the results were summarized: the brigade suffered no casualties, but the bandits—about nine of them—were mostly killed by an armored personnel carrier during the night, and the rest were shot. These were the results of the encounter.

**— As far as I know, you met your current wife in Mozambique, too?**

— Yes, there was such an incident in our lives.

**— So it was a very significant period for you?**

— Yes, it so happened that I spent two years there and returned in 1990, in general, to continue my studies as a student at the military institute. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union had already collapsed at that time, and 1991 was marked by the fact that we already knew that there would be major reductions. I was probably one of the first in my class to write a resignation letter, and in 1992, I left the institute.

**— Is the goal just to improve the family's financial situation?**

— It's just that, you know, such a huge country, \[the profession\] was in demand, and all of this was drastically reduced. Imagine, there were almost 4.5 million people in the Soviet Union's army. It's clear that the new country didn't need such an army. Naturally, by that time, troops had already been withdrawn from Afghanistan.

[Victor Booth and his wife](https://preview.redd.it/n3lqvjl9cbjg1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff6d52a14954957afa85291263e59d93151dc48f)

It was clear that the presence in Africa was quickly coming to an end. As a result, everything quickly collapsed. By the time I was fired, mass layoffs had already begun.

**— Your first successful business was when you became an aviation broker. Did you already understand that the African market would become your main focus?**

— Yes, of course. I was able to return to Africa very quickly, in 1992, in the summer. In 1991, I was sent on a business trip by the Union of United Cooperatives of the USSR to Mozambique, which was a slightly different project.

**— So you're going back to Mozambique?**

— Yes, I returned for the first time, but for various reasons, the project was not accepted. It was even the last Aeroflot flight to Mozambique. Naturally, at that time, all our military advisers and civilian personnel were being withdrawn, and there were a lot of people there, probably around 30,000 Soviet specialists in Mozambique.

And after that, my work as an aviation broker began in Angola. Although, in 1991, I left as a translator for the UN mission UNAVEM II (the UN mission in Angola from 1989 to 2003, aimed at ending the civil war).

**— Was it a civilian mission?""**

— Yes, it was a civilian mission. I went there with helicopter pilots from the Tyumen Aviation Unit. I stayed there for a short time, a few months, then returned and started my own business. I also returned to Angola, where we received our first contract as brokers and began working directly with that country.

**— Why did you realize that the African market is promising? It would seem that the Soviet Union is withdrawing from Africa, everything is collapsing. Everywhere they say that the Soviet Union did not understand why it ""fed"" Africa — such common myths. And you return to Africa, which everyone imagines as a poor continent: devastation, war… We leave there, and you go to earn money on the contrary.**

— First of all, there was a clear understanding that Africa is not a poor continent at all, but a continent of opportunities, a continent of the future. The colonial legacy was designed to prevent Africa from developing.

The Soviet Union did a lot: it trained personnel, provided assistance, and many African countries gained independence with the support, assistance, and direct involvement of the Soviet Union.

It was clear to me that it was not only possible, but also necessary to work in Africa. This is a vast and highly sought-after space on the African side that requires our presence, work, and joint projects.

https://preview.redd.it/q3ro437ccbjg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab01d4e4fcd399222933d13e5957b235979a83a

During the Soviet period, aid was not particularly compensated, and everything was written off as debt. However, I participated in negotiations where the local government in Mozambique offered to ""take over a concession, an entire province, and mineral extraction."" However, the Soviet Union's position was entirely different.

>This was probably a mistake, because there was no economic justification for our presence. As a result, the Soviet Union, and later Russia as its successor, had to write off or convert most of its debts.

And now, given this experience and the fact that Africans know Russia from a positive perspective — the assistance that Russia has provided in gaining independence — they have a rather warm and friendly attitude towards us.

**— When you created this business and went to Africa, you already understood that you had some competitive advantages. Even now, years later, the aviation industry is not doing well. So, what made you confident that this would be a successful and in-demand business?**

— First of all, at that time, Aeroflot was the largest airline in the world, with more than 13,000 or 14,000 aircraft. This airline was divided into thousands of small pieces, like a huge mirror, during the process of privatization. In my opinion, this was also a mistake, as it led to the creation of regional civil aviation departments, which later became independent companies.  As a result, all scheduled transportation in the country ceased, leaving only passenger transportation, which led to the formation of independent pricing. Consequently, many cargo planes remained unutilized.

https://preview.redd.it/1pzwf2hecbjg1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=22095c9969013b2082767a9cc9e09501aaf13131

In Russia, Gaidar's well-known reforms were implemented, and market relations were introduced. Many aircraft that previously operated on a scheduled basis and transported scheduled cargo were left unutilized. Negotiations were possible, as everyone was looking for ways to earn money. During this challenging period, it became a significant source of income for those companies that were able to maintain their operations. For airlines that remained after the collapse of Aeroflot, this was often their only source of revenue.

**— But you saw an advantage in transportation?**

— Yes, of course. Due to the fact that the Soviet Union created its equipment in a very economical and rational way, the cost of a flight hour for our aircraft in the 1990s — the Yak-12 and the Il-76 — was at least three times lower than that of any Western counterparts. This opened up a market for us to operate in.

**— So you could have seriously undercut the competition?**

— This probably wasn't dumping in the normal sense, because Western carriers weren't particularly present in Angola. There was a local company operating Boeing cargo planes, but they couldn't carry large cargo like the Il-76 or An-12, which were ramp-based aircraft. Yes, they had the C-130, but its flight hour cost was higher than that of the Il-76, and its cargo capacity was almost two and a half times lower

1r3z35s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3z35s,Travel stain remover head to head comparison.,"TLDR: Puracy pen for a fresh stain, Tide pen when in the hotel, Tide spray before wash. If I had to carry only one it would be the Puracy pen.

It was time to retire one of my ACA cirrus shirts (65% Polyester | 35% Cotton). So I cut it up to do a test of stain removal techniques and figured I'd share the results. I chose 4 different common stain types that the average pilot might run into on their trips.

(Clockwise from bottom right)

* Coffee
* Pen Ink- (Gel ink was used)
* BBQ Sauce- (for those of use with no tray table)
* Grease- (I wanted to mimic the nasty stuff that accumulates in the wheel wells. I used a combination of heavy grease, used motor oil, hydraulic fluid, and soot)

Each stain was applied with a Q-tip (except the pen) and promptly blotted with a paper towel. The respective stain removal technique was applied. The shirts were then left to sit for 3 days simulating the staining on day 1 of a 4 day pairing. The shirts were then spot treated with a 1/1 mixture of dawn, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide. The shirts were then placed in a bath of oxi-clean and warm water overnight, machine washed, and dried. I elected to have two control groups. The first will be a true control, the stain will be applied, wiped and no further treatment will take place. The second will be a ""washed"" control and will only have the the ""post trip"" applications applied (Dawn mix, oxi-clean bath, washed, dried). I believe the second will be the fairest comparison.

Stain removal Techniques

* [Tide Pen](https://a.co/d/05NRUUmV)
* [Tide Wipes](https://a.co/d/0anzQKWK)
* [Tide Spray](https://a.co/d/07kbXzbR)
* [Puracy Pen](https://a.co/d/07IM8Pi0)
* [Oxi-Clean Pen](https://a.co/d/0eW87qlB)
* Alcohol Wipe (Ask the FA)

Results:

* Coffee/BBQ Sauce- Non issue for all products.
* Pen Ink- Tide spray and pen performed best.
* Grease- Puracy pen performed best.

Recommendations: Puracy pen hands down will be the easiest to apply while wearing the shirt. The solution is applied with a roller ball which not as good as scrubbing out the stain as the coarse tip Tide pen. It would be hard to use the Tide pen to its full potential if you were wearing the shirt.

What I will be doing is carrying both the Puracy pen and Tide pen. Ill hit the initial wet stain with the Puracy pen, then use the tide pen to scrub out the stain in the hotel. I think the tide spray would be best used as a pre-wash treatment (instructions even say so). I'll test this method later and share.",18,1771012005.0,AirlinePilots,6,0.95,False

1r3z1td,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r3z1td/the_graveyard_shift_edited/,THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT (Edited),"I once smoked with an old man named Randall, whom we called Randy. He looked to be about in his early 60s. He asks me

“you seen them yet?”

“Seen who?” I asked giving him a curious glance while I took pulls of my cigarette.

“The ghosts. This graveyard is haunted ya know? Why do you think they pay us so well?” The old man replied after exhaling his cigarette.

I couldn’t help it. I busted out laughing.

Old man Randall looked at me offended saying

“I’M SERIOUS!” Old man Randy said before taking another pull of his poison. He exhales and gives me a stern look.

“Oh shit, you're being for real huh?” I asked with a smile still on my face.

“What don’t you believe in ghosts?” Randy asked me before taking one more drag from his tobacco stick.

“Of course, I don’t believe in ghosts. What are you crazy? That shit isn’t real. None of that paranormal stuff is real. It’s just a bunch of people making up stories trying to get attention. Everyone grieves their own way.” I said as I flicked the ash off my cigarette and onto the ground.

I told Randy

“If you ask me, anybody who speaks about seeing walking talking dead, people need to be put into a ward.” I said as I put out my cigarette and prepared to get back to work.

Randy stops me one last time yelling

“HEY!”Shouted Randy

I turned to face him once more, and when he realized he got my attention he told me

“Whether you believe in the paranormal or not you watch your back out there.” He said putting out his cigarette.

“Oh let me guess the “bad spirits” are going to get me?” I asked rolling my eyes. “What are they hostile?” I asked jokingly while making quotation marks with my fingers

Randy gives me a serious look. His face now rock solid cold he says

“You bet your sweet ass they are boi. Some of them are harmless. Listen kid I been working this job for 30 years. I seen things even I can’t explain. You know what happened to the last guy? The man you replaced? He went crazy. Said he started hearing voices in his head.”

“I don’t have time for this.. I’m just trying to get my shift over with and go home dude.”

I told Randy

“Look man. I appreciate you trying to warn me or whatever and I think it’s cool. You still have an open mind at your age, but I just don’t believe in that stuff. I have to get back to work or Joe will wring my neck it was nice speaking with you Randy.”

We said our goodbyes and parted ways. I went to continue collecting all the bouquets now wilting around the cemetery.

I came across a row of tombstones some so much old moss growing all over them. Some of the words were fading away on some of the stones. Some tall, some short.

It amazed me how strong they still stood there looking ancient and strong despite centuries and decades of abuse from the weather.

I come across a medium-sized tombstone I stopped to examine it it reads:

“In loving memory of Benjamin G. Wright loving father and leader. He left too soon and took with him the love of many others. His absence is a silent grief in his life, a beautiful memory. He will Forever will be missed. 1422 to 1456”

I read all the other tombstones as I made my way down the row picking up flowers.

I came across one that looked fancy the tombstone towered over me. I was curious about who deserved such special treatment. I read the stone:

“Rest in peace Claudia B. Rockwell. Loving mother, aunt, wife, sister, and grandma.

Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees? I will wait for you and should I fall behind wait for me. We will forever love you thank you for blessing the world with your music 1943-1995”

Huh, she died recently.. was she a singer?? I thought to myself  sadly I never heard of her or her music.

I went to read the next tombstone until I heard a noise behind me that sounded like footsteps. I turn around but nobody is there. I get a weird feeling I was being watched. I hear more footsteps behind me so I turn again trying to be faster this time.

Nothing.

Hello? I call out in the foggy darkness, but I couldn’t see anything past all the fog. Why was it so foggy out here? It was cold like winter temperatures. Which didn’t make sense because it was the middle of summer…

The grave bells ring…

\*DONG DONG DONG DONG DONG\*

I hear a woman singing behind me her voice echoed throughout the graveyard. She sang slowly and scratchily

🎶 🎼 “Tiptoe through the window

By the window, that is where I'll be

Come tiptoe through the tulips with me”🎵

I turn around and I see a woman with a skeletal face in a black long-sleeved wool dress, she wears a long black church wedding hat. Her eyes were hollow sunken, and black. Her skinny skeletal face decayed.

She continued to walk to me slowly I began to back away she kept singing her voice sounding broken as if somebody cut her vocal cords the fog just danced around her dress as she slowly walked towards me singing

🎵🎶” Ooh tip toe by the garden

By the garden of a willow tree

And tiptoe through the tulips with me”🎶

Ummm ma’am? You know you’re not supposed to be here right? It’s WAY past visiting hours. Unfortunately, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

I said to the creepy lady

The woman stops abruptly. Then she whispers

“Join ussss”

What? I asked trying to make sure I heard her correctly

The woman looked at me for a long moment then she started screaming at the top of her lungs. Long sharp teeth spouted from her mouth as her mouth slowly began stretching wider and wider with each scream. Her scream filled the graveyard. She ran towards me with both of her arms out. As if she was going to embrace me in a death hug.

I ran in the opposite direction afraid. Heart racing like a NASCAR!

As I was being chased I could hear the voices of children, women, and men singing in unison:

🎶🎵 “knee-deep in flowers we'll stray

We'll keep the showers away

And if I kiss you in the garden

In the moonlight, will you pardon me?

And tiptoe through the tulips with me”🎼🎶

I turned around and the eyeless woman was getting closer!

I could see her more clearly as the moonlight mixed with the votive lamps shone around us.

Her decaying skeletal face, her skeletal hands reaching out for me. I could see a tiny red glow in the darkness of each eye socket. She screamed and screamed as she made her way to me.

Running faster and faster with each step.

I didn’t stop I kept going. I haul ass out of there. Running faster than I ever ran in my life!

I didn’t dare look back as I heard her screams draw closer and closer near me.

I finally got to the graveyard gates and ran through shutting and locking them behind me. When I looked up the woman in the cocktail dress was gone.

3 days have passed since then. I sat in my living room drinking a cold bourbon I been keeping stored in the freezer. I was still trying to process what I saw that night.

I haven’t spoken to anyone for the past few days. I couldn’t even form words when I tried.

Old man Randy’s voice echoed in my head

“Have you seen them yet? The ghosts.

This graveyard is haunted ya know?”

Just as I begin to zone out I hear the phone ring it takes me by surprise! I jump at the sound.

“Relax man relax you probably just need to get more sleep that’s all. You were up late for the last few days.”

I told myself before picking up the phone. I take a deep breath and exhale then answer the phone

Hello? I ask

{“Hey Harry it’s me Joe. Listen I’m sorry for bothering you on your day off. Do you Wanna make some extra hours? I’ll triple the cash! Randy called in sick. Some kids broke into the graveyard last night. The fuckers took a body! Coffin and everything! Crazy little bastards. I called the police to check it out. So if the police show up wanting to speak to you it’s about that. Anyways I really need somebody on the grounds tonight. Especially after that incident. So What do you say? Wanna take the shift?”}

Give me a minute Joe I’ll be right back. I responded into the mic. I set my phone down. I thought it about long and hard.

This job pays 800 bucks a night. Here my boss Joe was on the phone offering me DOUBLE the pay. That’s an easy $1,600

I’m behind on rent. One more strike and I’ll get an eviction. The landlord is losing patience with me. I can’t just stop now I need the money! I got bills to pay…

I pick up the phone and speak into the mic of the phone saying

“Yeah I’ll take it”

Later that night at 11:30 pm I took a break. I went to the break room and made myself a sandwich I sat there eating while watching my favorite YouTuber on my phone.

Suddenly I hear the grave bell ring.

DONG DONG DONG DONG DONG DONG

I then hear a giggle. Sounded like a little boy. I sniffed the air something smelled like it was burning.

I hear the giggle again. I see a bright light coming from down the hallway outside the break room door. I set my sandwich down.

I walk slowly and cautiously towards the door. The smell got stronger. Smelled like burned meat with plastic.

I got to the door but before I could open it something sharp hit me in the back of the head.

I holler in pain and I jump outta fear. I turned around nobody was there. I look down to see what hit me. It was a butter knife.

What the fuck? I ask myself the lights in the break room begin to flicker, kitchen drawers open and shut violently, the pictures fly off the walls as if somebody was pulling them off and throwing them one by one, the drawers in the kitchen yank open, and all the silverware hovers into the air before flying directly at me.

I duck down avoiding the attack. The cabinets begin to open and shut now, the microwave turns on, and the refrigerator doors violently pull open.

I run out of the room and into the hallway. I look down the hallway and see the bright light and smoke!!!

Holy shit! A fire!! I Yelled I ran to get the fire extinguisher. I ran to the end of the hallway the flames growing larger as I approached.

I begin to spray away at the flames. Putting them out slowly but surely. smoke filled the air choking me up as I backed away.

I hear the giggle again..

I look down at the end of the hallway. I see a boy who looks no older than 7.

His eyes were completely white, he had blue lips from lack of blood circulation, his skin was pale, and he was dressed in overalls with a plaid t-shirt under them. The boy had bloody scratches all over his face, chunks of flesh were missing from his arms, and bones could be seen as the little boy raised his arms and said

“Look at me mister I’m burning”

His body began to catch on fire, he looked like a lit match, he extended his arms walking towards me.

His flesh burning with each step the boy began laughing as he got closer and closer to me.

I hear the grave bell ring

DONG DONG DONG DONG DONG

I hollered as loud as I could as I ran for the exit.

I ran out of the building still screaming like a manic my heart was pounding. I stood there outside trying to catch my breath. When I looked back the little boy was gone. As if he never was there.

“Okay, now I’m a little freaked out wait… NO!! I refuse to believe any of that ghost bullshit! It was a fire! Nothing else. It was probably caused by that punk ass little kid!”

I say to myself as I pull out my phone and call 911

(“911 what’s your emergency?”)

I hold the phone close to my ear and tell her what happened

“You need to send somebody out here right now! NO! There’s a little kid up here causing fires! I DON’T KNOW HOW HE GOT IN HERE!”

The operator asked for a description of the little arsonist I told her what he was wearing.

“Yes, I think he’s still around he’s in the break facility. It’s the only building in the cemetery! The address is 49-02 Laurel Hill Blvd, Woodside!”

The 911 operator asks me to repeat myself due to interference.

\*static can be heard on the phone line\*

(“hello? Sir…. Sir??… your breaking up… I can’t… hear you…. Sir?? Can you please-“)

The signal drops.

“FUCK!!!! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?!?” I yelled out in the darkness holding back the urge to throw my phone!

I looked down trying to gather myself.

I try to calm down but when I look up I get taken by surprise and relief!

Suddenly I see red and blue lights at the cemetery gate entrance. Flashing in the distance through the fog.

I ran like a track star to the gate entrance embracing the sound of katydids and crickets as I ran towards the gate.

Suddenly I hear a deep southern voice call out from behind me

“Howdy partna! I reckon you're the one who called?”

I turn around swiftly and I see an officer wearing a tan/brown sheriff's or deputy uniform, a western-style uniform, and a Stetson-style hat. He was wearing black tinted sunglasses. The officer looked to be about in his mid 30s. Proudly sporting a thick mustache above his lips.

I stare at him in confusion and reply

“Umm yeah, I’m the one who called… how did you get here? I never saw you come in. I didn’t even hear you walking behind me.” I say to the officer with a confused look on my face.

The officer slowly walks towards me with his hands in his pockets.

“Well son I was in the area when I got the call I took the back entrance”

“You called us sounding as Nervous as a whore in church,” the officer says in his thick southern accent. He began looking around the cemetery. As if he were admiring it.

“Yes sir because I saw a fire inside while I was eating in the break room. I put out the fire and I see this little kid who was wearing horror makeup obviously! Trying to scare me! I don’t know how he did it! Somehow he set himself ablaze and started walking towards me!! Must’ve been a pyrotechnic trick!”

I exclaimed to the police officer before examining the cemetery with my eyes looking for the kid.

The police officer shoots me a look then points over to the break facility. He says

“You mean that boy right there?”

“YES!! THAT'S HIM!! THAT'S HIM RIGHT THERE!”

The little boy peered over from the side of the old building.  His eyes were completely white his hair dangling revealing a bloody wound in his head, bloody cuts all over his face.

He began laughing and giggling. Holding his mouth as if he was trying to resist laughing.

“Whoa whoa calm ya horses partna your as jumpy as spit on a hot skillet,""

“Sir you need to get that boy now! Before he causes more damage to the property!” I said trying not raise my voice. “And where’s the fire department?!” I ask

Then a light bulb went off in my head. I stare at the officer in fear saying

“Wait a minute… You said you came through the back entrance… The cemetery doesn’t have a back entrance…”

The sheriff Deputy chuckles then he tells me

“Yeah you’re right.. it doesn’t…”

I hear the grave bells ring again louder than before:

DONG! DONG! DONG! DONG! DONG!

The sheriff takes off his black tactical sunglasses revealing deep dark hollow eyes. His eye sockets were soaked in darkness he had no eyeballs but blood began to leak from his eyes,  he smiled, showing sharp dirty teeth,

The officer then puts both hands on his face. He begins to pull at his face until he rips it completely off. The sound of his skin tearing sounded like ripping paper.

He pulled off his face and then ripped off his lips. His face is now covered in blood showing the facial muscle beneath. He began to chuckle loudly it sounded like he had a hundred voices laughing with him.

“You have the fucking right to remain silent harry. Anything you say can and will be used against you…. IN HELL”

I turn around and run to the gate entrance. I can hear footsteps chasing behind me. I forced myself not to look back. Running faster.

Faster.

Faster.

I could hear laughter all around me. I use all my endurance to make it to the gate.

I opened the gate quickly slamming it shut behind me. I place my hands over my head. I looked around the cemetery with my eyes. expecting to see the police officer but he wasn’t there anymore. He vanished without warning.

I hear a car doors slam behind me. I jumped like a cat outta water. I turn quickly and see two police officers walking towards me. Followed by a fire department tuck pulling up

After much explanation, the police take my name and write down my information. While the firemen asks me where the fire is or was. I tell them Before proceeding into the cemetery. The police and I look around the cemetery trying to find the officer and the little boy.

Nothing.

No matter how much we looked we couldn’t find them! NOWHERE!

Then here comes the firemen walking steadily towards us.

One gives me a very displeased look. He asks me:

“Is this your idea of some joke kid?”

“What do you mean?” I asked back

“We checked the entire building there are no signs that there was a fire anywhere at all. All we found was some dust and spiders! Stop wasting our time.”  says the firemen before walking past me and back to their trucks.

I was bewildered the police looked at me like I was crazy

“HEY I KNOW WHAT I SAW!” I proclaimed

“We never said you didn’t man” one of the officers says to me.

The officers give me a tired and concerned look they tell me

“Look whoever it was they must be long gone by now. We didn’t find any signs of forced entry around the perimeter. If you see anybody else here give us a call. As of right now there isn’t much we can do. It’s getting late your tired  your mind is probably playing tricks on you.” The officers turn away to leave the graveyard

At this point, I didn’t know what to think. I finished up the shift and went home. The next morning I sat in the kitchen drinking coffee thinking to myself.

Old man Randy’s words echoed in my head

“You know what happened to the last guy? The man you replaced? He went crazy. Said he started hearing voices in his head.”

I need to find this guy and ask some questions. Was I crazy? I had to be sure. The following day I called Joe and asked him where Miguel lived. He was hesitant at first but eventually he told me.

I'll go to Miguel’s next week and sit down and have a talk with him.

The next week:

“Hey Miguel. I’m sorry for taking your job man.” I said feeling guilty

“Don’t worry about it I have a better one.”Miguel says pouring himself a shot. He then tips the bottle over my cup and begins to pour.

“I just wanted to know what really made you quit? I've been seeing some pretty bizarre things at the cemetery. I’m supposed to work tonight I wanted to ask you for some advice.” I said before taking my shot.

“So what made you quit working at the cemetery” I asked Miguel

Miguel looks up from his phone and gives me a horrified expression. The color flushed from his face. He looked around nervously then back to me he asked

“You still work there?”

I reply “Well yeah, I still work there I gotta pay the bills somehow.”

He looks me in the eyes with a serious troublesome expression. Looks like he's gonna start sweating any minute now

I”if you know what’s best for yourself. You will quit that job tonight.” Miguel said

I was confused I asked “why?”

Miguel begins to freak out a bit then he grabs me by the shoulders and looks me in the eyes saying

“I still hear their voices in my head man. You know how I got this scar on my face? A shovel came flying at me like a fucking rocket. I had to get 20 stitches.”

I push his hands off me and begin to back away slowly

Miguel walks forward slowly with a crazed look on his face. His eyes widen, and he gets closer saying

“You think it’s a coincidence that the last 5 other people before us all died? Oh, but they don’t wanna tell you that do they? The 5 is the only bodies that’s been found! There is most likely more that we don’t know about!”Miguel continues

I couldn’t back up any further I felt the wall behind me halt my movement. Miguel stood in front of me saying

“The dead don’t envy the living Harry they hate us! They’re jealous because we’re alive and they are not! Just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there.” Miguel said while pointing upstairs to his bedroom he remained standing firmly

I tell him

“Hey man, I just forgot I need to go home to do something. It was nice talking with you Miguel. I said as I made my way to the front door of the house preparing to leave.

I hear Miguel yell at me from behind.

“YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE WHO’S ALREADY DEAD HARRY! YOU CAN'T HURT THEM BUT THEY DAMN SURE CAN HURT YOU! QUIT THE JOB HARRY! QUIT THE FUCKING JOB BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!”",1,1771011920.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I’ve been thinking lately that it would be really nice to meet some new people and have more genuine conversations. So here I am, putting myself out there. 

A little about me: I enjoy good and random conversations about pretty much anything. Life, random thoughts at 2am, music, movies, tv shows, games, something you made or cooked recently. Goals, deep topics, or just everyday stuff. I’m always open to learning about new things about new people. You don’t have to be super interesting or have wild stories, but if you do have a tale to tell then please share.

I’m here to:

	•	Make new friends

	•	Have chill, meaningful chats

	•	Share laughs and random memes

	•	Maybe even build long-term friendships

If you’re also looking for someone to talk to, feel free to message me. Tell me about what you like and what you like to do and why pjs are the best choice of clothing ever. Are you a tea or coffee person? What’s your favourite colour. Hit me with everything

I wasn't even trying to quit nicotine, and yet, I've quit nicotine, and also, I've been trying to quit porn and masturbation, and though I already did before supplements, now I've had 0 desire to even look at porn, and am disgusted by it now. 

But I'm wondering how I should take supplements? For now, I will likely continue taking my supplements, though perhaps not every day. Of course, supplements are expensive, but seems to be worth the price.

But my question is, do you think supplements help you change, and are for help, or do you think they are meant to be taken forever? Perhaps they are similar to coffee, where you take it forever, but you can take breaks from it for rest...

**Who This Community Is For**

This is for people who use their phone like a tool — not like a toy.

• Heavy texters who spend hours a day replying, drafting, correcting, explaining

• Busy professionals who value time more than $8/month

• People working across multiple languages

• Social media managers, founders, salespeople, real estate agents, operators

• Anyone who prefers speaking instead of typing

• People who need their hands free — carrying coffee, using tools, wearing gloves

• Laptop workers who find it faster to generate content by voice on their phone

• Power users who want more than “just voice typing”

If you care about speed, control, and not jumping between apps all day — you’re in the right place.

**Who This Is NOT For**

• People looking for the cheapest possible keyboard

• Casual users who type a few messages a day

• Anyone who doesn’t care about optimizing how they communicate

• People who don’t like experimenting with tools or giving feedback

This is a power tool. It’s built for people who want control.

**Why This Keyboard Is Different**

Yes, many keyboards have voice typing.

But this goes further:

• Instant access to AI tools without digging through menus

• Custom buttons with your own prompts

• Tone rewriting in one tap

• Multiple languages accessible directly from the mic ring

• Record voice, switch apps, keep talking while reading

• Large editor one click away — edits come straight back into your keyboard

You can do serious work without leaving your keyboard.

**What This Community Is For**

• Sharing real-world use cases

• Suggesting features

• Technical feedback

• Power-user setups

• Prompt sharing

• Honest discussion about whether it’s worth the subscription

1r3yvs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/thane/comments/1r3yvs1/thane_veg_food_cart_entrepreneurs_or_aspirants/,"Thane veg food cart entrepreneurs (or aspirants), can we chat?","Over the last few weeks I’ve been slowly building out a small open‑air veg food court space in Thane, and the journey has been… interesting. I’ve spoken to people who wanted to do dosa, chaat, nachos, even BYOB‑style tacos (bring your own bag of chips and we load it up), and it’s made me realise how many folks are stuck at the “thinking about it” stage with food carts.

Some common patterns I’ve seen in these conversations:

People love the idea of a cart as a lower‑risk stepping stone before a café/cloud kitchen.

Families get involved – spouse, parents, siblings – and decisions slow down because everyone wants it to be “perfect” before starting.

Terms, deposits, lock‑ins, licenses (FSSAI, shops & establishment, fire, etc.) feel intimidating, so plans get postponed indefinitely while they “plan more”.

I’m trying to build my place as more of a co‑working style hub for veg food carts – shared seating, common standards for hygiene and cart design, and a “one cart = one cuisine” approach so nobody directly undercuts anyone else – but I’m equally curious about what others are trying, what’s scaring them off, and what support would actually help them take the first step.

If you’re currently running a cart in Thane, or, seriously thinking about starting one (but stuck on numbers, family buy‑in, or setup), or, have shut one down and are willing to share what went wrong.. I’d love to hear your experiences, mistakes, and what you wish you’d known before starting.

Happy to also share what I’ve learned so far about: basic compliance (FSSAI, shop & establishment, etc.) and what has/hasn’t worked in my conversations with potential vendors.

If anyone wants to take it beyond comments, we can always grab a chai/coffee sometime and talk carts, but this post is mainly to get a real, on‑ground discussion going about veg food carts as a first business in and around Thane.

Recently we went away to a concert together, I booked all the accommodation, tickets and organised transport/ me driving 6 hours as I am the only one with a license and car.

The concert we went to is in our country capital city where also her brother lives, whose shes very close too. On the first day I told her I would like to go sleep at the hotel before the concert that night. She was okay with it, and asked if she could spend the day with her brother. I was all for it since I was in no state to hangout after driving six hours straight, and the concert was that night so I wanted to catch up on sleep. We got to the concert on time, and I apologised to her for taking the uber 20 mins early from when it was supposed to end, as I accidentally booked it for later. She seemed understanding I felt bad of course.

 So the day after she asked to go haw breakfast with her brother, which I just told her to come back in before check out so we could check out, pack the car and find a park together to relieve some of the stress for me. So forty minutes before check out time I asked her where she was since this was now 10 oclock and we spoke at 0630 about this plan, she texted saying she was on a uni tour with her brother, and asked me to just pack her stuff into the car and check out without her. i was very disappointed but because we were away I didn’t say anything about it. So i packed the car and asked when she will be done with her brother, she told me she will be back in two hours. So I was left waiting around for two hours in a city I dont live in and without the person I wanted to spend the day with.

Anyways we eventually meet up and drove home, the next following days it rubbed me the wrong way. So I ended up going and chatting with her over coffee in a less confrontational manner, as I value this friendship. I told her how I felt on the second day, how I felt she had just used me for a ride and hadn’t hung out with me most of the time there. That at checkout I had to carry the load and I had all the problems put on me.

She apologised of course about most of it, then said “I understand the wanting to hangout together, but I don’t understand checking out. I only had one bag.” I think that stirred the conversation about it, so I explained to her I drove, got the accommodation and checked out. She completely dismissed me when we were there while I was left to do everything, while she was having time of her life somewhere else.

She began bringing up the uber thing how she hated how i booked it early, which I apologised. Then she brought up how exhausted I was on the first day and didn’t seem to want to be there.. I had to explain to her I drove most of the way.

After that she was wasnt very responsive, maybe because of how I presented it. (BTW Before this trip we agreed to go halfs in everything accomodation and gas, it took me the night before our trip to get her half of the accomodation money from her after asking three times. And it took me seven times after the trip asking for her part of the gas money. So I should have followed up better about this all)

I had asked others opinions about it and they all said I should have said something on the trip, rather wait till after. Which I can understand now, of course as it wouldn’t come to this.

Since then shes been ignoring my texts I sent her.

1r3yqme,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1r3yqme/primacy_protocolhallowed7/,Primacy Protocol-Hallowed-7,"*Hello all. Here’s another entry into my Primacy Project, this time focusing on the events in the frontier of Primacy Conclave’s expansion. In case it wasn’t clear from last time, I do plan to tell stories in this AU with a rotating cast of characters but in different genres. The last group will mostly be slice-of-life and coming-of-age types fair while this one is more action heavy. Hope you enjoy!* 

**Personal Log - Specialist Aled Macdonald, 3rd Expeditionary Battalion** 

**Location**: *Forward Operating Base Tenacity, Hallowed-7* **Date**: *June 14, 2125 (Local Calendar)* **Time**: *06:47 Hours, Morning After Night Assault* 

The thing about alien blood is that it comes in all sorts of pretty colors. 

I stood at the observation post on FOB Resilience's eastern wall, morning sun just starting to burn off the night's mist, and traced patterns in the carnage spread across the no-man's land below. Purple streaks from the Krakotl—bird bastards bled bright as a neon rave. Same with Kolshians, though theirs were thick and viscous like spilled paint. Blue Gojid smears, orange Venlil pools, and about a dozen other hues mixing together into what looked like someone had taken a rainbow and beaten it to death with a hammer. 

Beautiful, in a fucked-up sort of way. Or at least in a Primate one. 

I drew my finger along the observation port's edge, mentally connecting the larger pools. That cluster of orange there, the purple streak running east, that massive green explosion where a cluster of Harchen and Duerten had caught a fragmentation round dead center... if you squinted, it almost looked like a bird.  

""You seeing what I'm seeing?"" Leo's voice came from my left, familiar Gibraltar accent mixing with that distinctive Macaque rasp that always made him sound younger than his twenty-eight years. 

I glanced over at my bond-brother. He'd shaved his head again yesterday—said the heat was making his fur itch—and the morning light caught on the tattoo covering his left shoulder. Our shared mark: the Gibraltar Strait rendered in impressionistic black ink, with two stylized hands clasped across the water. One human, one Macaque. Seven thousand years of alliance compressed into one image. 

It was modest compared to most Humans; the sleeve on my right told half my childhood and hobbies in clear, verbose detail in its patterns and lines and my hands were a textbook sketch of my rocky love life and my one and to date only serious relationship that had terminated pretty violently three years back. In comparison, Leo’s ink was less life story and more anecdote, but at least it was a good one. 

""Depends,"" I said, turning back to the battlefield. ""What are you seeing?"" 

""That big purple spill near the crater?"" He pointed with one long finger. ""Looks like a dick."" 

I snorted. ""Everything looks like a dick to you."" 

""Because everything *is* a dick if you look at it right."" He grinned, showing canines. ""That's philosophy, that is."" 

""That's you being fourteen mentally."" 

""Says the pri tracing shapes in blood pools like we're cloud-watching."" 

Fair point. I went back to my artistic interpretation of the previous night's slaughter. The Feds had tried another assault—their fourth this week. You'd think after losing three thousand troops in their last forward engagement they'd have learned, but no. The Federation kept throwing bodies at Hallowed-7 like we were going to run out of ammunition before they ran out of warm bodies. 

Spoiler: we weren't. 

""That one looks like a sheep,"" I said, pointing at a particularly large splatter of orange mixed with the darkened yellow of what had probably been one of those spider-things; what were they called again, Tillish or something? The bodies were piled three deep in some places where the automated defenses had caught them in overlapping fields of fire. 

Leo's tail twitched beside me—the Barbary Macaque had this way of perching on the rampart edge that made him look like he was about to launch himself at something. Probably was or was at least thinking about doing it but denying the impulse. ""Where? I don't see it."" 

""There, the one that looks like it's screaming."" 

""They're all screaming, mate."" He squinted, then grinned, teeth flashing. ""Oh, wait—yeah, that's definitely got the whole 'terrified sheep' vibe. Five points."" 

We'd been playing this game since dawn after I’d drawn the short straw and Leo had joined because they were Bonded and that meant sharing in said Bonded’s misery and trials even when they threatened to bore you into standing sleep. A touch morbid, sure but its not like there was much else to do aside from watching the native scavengers taking picking at the corpses. 

""Your go,"" I said, leaning back against the reinforced plasteel barrier. European FOB design meant Tenacity was built like a fortress—overlapping kill zones, redundant power systems, automated turrets every fifteen meters, and enough munitions stockpiled to hold off an army. Which was good, because that's exactly what we'd been doing for the past month and a half. 

Leo's eyes scanned the battlefield with that particular brand of analysis that they couldn’t quite shake despite millennia living, fighting and growing up around us Great Apes; some things were just blood deep, I guess. ""That cluster near the third breach attempt—looks like a hedgehog if you tilt your head."" 

""That's just a scorch mark."" 

""It's a prickly, hedgehog-shaped scorch mark. That's close enough."" He marked an invisible scoreboard in the air. ""Six to five, I'm winning."" 

""You're cheating."" 

""I'm creative. Not my fault you lack imagination."" 

A familiar heavy tread on the metal decking announced our third visitor before he spoke. ""You two are disturbed individuals,"" Lakun rumbled, his gravelly voice hitting our translators like rocks in a tumbler. ""Staring at corpses like tourists viewing art."" 

I didn't turn around. Lakun had been with our unit for three weeks now and I'd learned the Arxur didn't appreciate direct eye contact early in the morning. Something about 'challenge behaviors' and 'dominance signaling' that I honestly couldn't be bothered to care about. 

""Morning, Lakun,"" I said cheerfully. ""Sleep well?"" 

""No. The bunks are too small. The room smells like mammals. And there are too many of you making too much noise at all hours."" 

""You’ll get used to it."" He’d have to if he wanted to work literally anywhere even remotely decent Primacy.  

""So you keep telling me. I’ve yet to feel it happen."" He moved up beside me, and I caught his reflection in the observation port's glass. Big bastard, even for an Arxur. Had to be two-and-a-half meters tall, covered in scars that told a story I didn't want to read this early in the morning and before my coffee. One of his eyes had this milky quality that suggested old damage, though it didn't seem to affect his efficacy either in the worksites on Ceres or with our company. ""When is breakfast?"" 

""Twenty minutes,"" Leo said, not looking up from his blood-pool analysis. ""Why, you hungry?"" 

""Obviously. I have been awake for two hours and have not eaten."" 

""Cafeteria's open now if you want early meal."" 

""The early meal is inadequate."" Lakun's emphasis on the word made it sound like a war crime. ""They serve the good food at the scheduled time."" 

I exchanged a glance with Leo. The Arxur had opinions about food. Strong opinions. Very specific opinions about temperature, texture, freshness, and about forty other factors that apparently mattered to a reptilian raider-well, ex-raider's- palate. Apparently having military standing made you picky. 

""Could always snack on the buffet,"" Leo said, perfectly deadpan, jerking his thumb toward the battlefield below. 

Lakun made a sound somewhere between a growl and a gag. ""That is not funny."" 

""Little bit funny."" 

""The Prey have probably poisoned themselves since their sudden acquisition of a spine and have been *decomposing in the sun for eight hours.*"" The Arxur's tail lashed once. ""Even Betterment cattle were processed immediately after slaughter for quality control."" 

""Well, we’re heading that direction anyway. Gotta make sure some arsehole doesn’t snipe our table."" I said, standing and stretching until my spine cracked. ""Unless you two want to keep arguing about the ethics of corpse disposal."" 

""I could argue that all day,"" Leo said cheerfully, dropping from the rampart with the casual disregard for gravity like he typically did. ""But Roland's probably already complaining about the food and I want to watch Muaz defend the honor of military rations again."" 

Lakun snorted but fell into step behind us. He moved quieter than something his size had any right to, old raider habits dying hard. ""The rodent complains about everything."" 

""Roland complains because he's correct,"" I said. ""The food here is shit. We just have lower standards than someone who grew up eating off plates worth more than our annual salaries."" I shoot the reptile a side glance “Also, don’t call him a rodent; that’s a slur and a pretty bad one too. Don’t wanna see you getting written up by PR again.” 

“He calls him a rodent frequently.” Lakun pointed a claw at Leo who grinned. 

“Because he’s an arsehole and Roland is easy to bait.” I gave my brother a look and he flicked by off with his tail “Besides, he’s a Monkey and their Prosimian. Different optics.” 

“How?” the big guy asked 

“Because when a Monkey says it, its coming from a fellow Primate on the lower end of the totem pole, relatively at least. If Aled said it, that’d cause a fight because he’s Great Ape. And if you called him it-” Leo paused, looking at the Arxur as he thought “actually, it's not that big a deal, come to think of it. Kinda like mutt calling a wolf a bitch.” 

Lakun’s eye had narrowed and his retort was smothered as we made our way to the cafeteria. 

The cafeteria was exactly as chaotic as expected. A shifting crowd of Primates from all species and corners of Sol. A Baboon gunner chatting with a Gibbon, an Orangutan specialist eating solo in the elevated rafters, a group of Chimp mercs being rowdy with a pair of Mandrills from communications. Hell, there was even a Neanderthal not so subtly talking up one of the Human recruits, her cheeks flushing as she tried to maintain professional decorum. The Primacy Conclave and Primacy as a whole writ in small scale across the room.  

Roland sat at our usual table looking like someone had personally offended him by existing. The Mouse Lemur was barely taller than the protein paste dispenser, but he radiated the kind of aristocratic disdain that made you want to apologize for breathing his air. His family owned like a third of the Lemur Hegemony's streaming empire, which apparently meant he knew what real food tasted like and this wasn't it. 

""—absolutely unacceptable,"" he was saying to no one in particular. ""I am eating *recycled* protein paste. *Recycled*. Do you understand what that means? This passed through someone's digestive system, got processed by the waste reclamation units, and is now being presented as food."" 

""That's how recycling works,"" I said, sliding into the seat across from him. ""Everything's recycled when you're three thousand light-years from home."" 

Roland looked up, and his oversized eyes—typical for Mouse Lemurs—fixed on me with pure aristocratic disdain. ""Aled. How delightful. Please explain to me why I am eating processed waste when my family literally owns a controlling share in Sol’s collective food production corporations?"" 

""Because you signed up for military service?"" 

""That was a mistake."" He stabbed his fork into the protein paste with unnecessary violence. ""I was drunk on national pride and Primate superiority. I have since sobered and realized that patriotism tastes significantly worse than my family's chef's cooking."" 

Leo grabbed a ration pack and dropped into the seat next to me. ""If you hate it so much, why'd you join?"" 

""Because—"" Roland took a breath, composed himself. ""Because the Federation needed to understand that they are not the only space-faring empire. Because the Arxur needed to learn that 'predators' are not some unified threat. Because *Primates* needed to demonstrate galactic dominance. And because my father said I couldn't do it, so naturally I had to prove him wrong."" 

""Spite is a valid motivator,"" Muaz said, joining us with a truly impressive pile of vegetables on his tray which had Lakun making a hiss of distaste. Arxur were always so touchy about Primates like Gorillas who looked like their idea of a Predator but ate plants instead like Prey. 

""The only valid motivator."" Roland gestured with his fork. ""Spite and pride. That's why I'm here eating recycled proteins instead of dining on actually fresh cuisine prepared by professionals."" 

Lakun arrived with two ration packs—both protein-heavy, synthetic meat that he still groused about even as he ate it—and sat at the end of the table. He looked at Roland's food, then at Roland. ""You complain about recycled proteins? This is luxury compared to Dominion ration packs."" 

""I wasn't raised in the Dominion,"" Roland shot back. ""I was raised in an estate on Europa with private chefs and imported delicacies from across the Sol System. My standards are appropriately elevated."" 

""Your standards are annoying,"" Lakun said, tearing into his first pack. 

""Someone has to defend civilization from the barbarians."" His eyes flicked to Lakun, then away. ""Present company... occasionally excluded."" 

""How generous,"" Lakun growled. 

""I am very generous. I could've said 'all Arxur are barely sapient,' but I'm learning cultural sensitivity."" Roland took a deliberate bite of his protein ration, gagged theatrically, then continued. ""The Feds are definitely barely sapient though. Did you see their assault pattern last night? They literally ran straight at our guns screaming about predators. No tactics. No suppressing fire. Just blind panic and flamethrowers."" 

“And yet somehow they ran the galaxy, so they must’ve done something right.” I said, biting into my own ration and chewed. Yep, still shit but at least my tastebuds were starting to become used to it. Or maybe just numb, hard to say which.  

“The Prey did not go uncontested.” Lakun said, something like pride edging into his voice “We made them aware that they could not so easily swarm about without resistance from superior, True Sapients and not the pantomime of intelligence they proport to have.” 

""Ironic coming from the species of genocidal cannibals."" Roland piped in primly around another loathed bite of rationed gruel. 

The temperature at the table dropped about five degrees. Lakun's head came up slowly, and his good eye fixed on Roland with an intensity that probably would have terrified someone who gave a shit. The chatter at nearby tables died down as eyes fell on our table with keen interest. 

Roland stared back, completely unfazed. ""What? It's true. Your species practiced sapient consumption for centuries. That's historical fact, not insult."" 

""Careful, Roland,"" I said mildly. “no need to stir up trouble with allies.” I made sure to stress the word so even someone as thick as our tech specialist couldn’t misread the intention. 

""I am being careful and I'm also being factual."" The Mouse Lemur hadn't broken eye contact. ""The Arxur Dominion operated cattle farms with captured Federation species and consumed them despite having access to non-sapient alternatives. This is documented. Lakun knows this. Everyone at this table knows this. All Primacy knows this."" 

""The Federation killed our cattle after failing to ‘cure’ us because they were ignorant of obligate carnivorism,"" Lakun said, voice flat. ""Then abandoned us to starvation."" 

""And instead of hunting non-sapient animals on other worlds—which existed and were known to exist—your Betterment leadership decided sapient consumption was ideologically preferable."" Roland took a bite of his hated protein paste. ""That was a choice. A stupid, evil choice that demonstrated severe cognitive deficiency."" 

""Roland—"" Muaz started. 

""No, let him talk,"" Lakun interrupted. ""Let the little rodent tell me how my species are morons. I have heard it before. I will hear it again. It changes nothing."" 

""He's not a rodent,"" I said to the Arxur. ""he’s a primate. And Lakun, he's not saying you're a moron."" 

""Just my entire species and culture."" 

""Your entire species' leadership,"" Roland corrected. ""I make distinctions. Betterment were morons. You, personally, are merely difficult and prone to morning irritability."" 

Lakun stared at him for a long moment, then made a sound that might have been a laugh. Might have been. ""Yes. I suppose that’s accurate enough."" 

""See?"" Roland said to the table. ""I can be diplomatic."" 

""That was you being an arsehole with qualifiers."" Leo countered.  

""Diplomacy is just being an beating your opponent into submission via various means whether that be ideologically, financially, militarily, spiritually, or morally."" 

Muaz sighed, the long-suffering sound of someone who'd had this conversation before. ""Can we please have one meal without species-based conflict?"" 

""No,"" Roland and Leo said simultaneously. 

“We could circle back to talking shit about Feds if you’d prefer.” I offered, taking a sip of instant coffee that tasted like watery dirt and sweet cream. “Like how terrible most of them are in close quarters.” 

Muaz shifted, the young Gorilla's honor-culture upbringing warring with frontier pragmatism. ""There is honor in combat. Even against unworthy opponents, we demonstrate our capability."" 

""Your 'capability' yesterday involved ripping a Krakotl in half,"" Leo pointed out. ""Very honorable."" 

""He was attempting to immolate our position. I responded proportionally."" 

""By ripping him in half."" Leo’s raised brow could be heard in his tone. 

""I made sure to sunder him into parallel portions as a matter of professional pride and principal."" 

I was about to comment on the philosophical implications of proportional dismemberment when the alert sirens started screaming. 

""**ALERT. INCOMING FEDERATION FORCES DETECTED. ALL PERSONNEL TO DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. ALERT. INCOMING FEDERATION FORCES—**"" 

""Fuck's sake,"" I muttered, grabbing my coffee—because I was going to finish my coffee, thank you very much. ""They're early this morning."" 

""Third assault in four days,"" Leo said, already moving. ""They're getting desperate."" 

Our table scattered with practiced efficiency. Muaz went for heavy weapons, Roland headed to the tech center, Lakun grabbed his rifle and moved toward the east wall positions. Leo and I had our own spot—observation tower three, perfect for sharpshooter work. 

""*CONTACT! North perimeter, mixed Fed force, estimated two hundred hostiles!*"" 

Commander Issa el-Turay's voice crackled through our comms, the Baboon's gravelly tone somehow conveying both urgency and the bone-deep exhaustion of someone who'd been doing this for thirty years. ""Second Squad, you're on intercept. Try not to blow up anything expensive this time."" 

""No promises, boss!"" Leo called back, already sprinting for the armory. 

We moved like we'd done this a thousand times because we basically had. Lakun grabbed his massive rifle—custom job, had to be to fit his claws—and his Arxur-made blade and made for the designated position with a predatory lope. Muaz was already in his combat rig, the Gorilla's dense muscle mass making him a walking tank even before the armor plating. Roland scrambled into his tech station, tiny paws flying across holographic displays. 

I grabbed my rifle—Conclave-issue marksman variant, railgun acceleration with smart-linked optics and enough stopping power to punch through most armor like tissue paper—and felt the familiar calm settle over me. Combat brain. Different from regular brain. Regular brain worried about mortality and ethics and whether the cafeteria eggs were actual eggs. Combat brain just solved problems with geometry and trigger pulls. 

""North perimeter,"" I confirmed, syncing my optics with the FOB's tactical net. Red icons bloomed across my HUD—definitely about two hundred contacts, moving in something that almost looked like formation. ""They're trying to flank the automated defenses."" 

""*Let them try,*"" Roland's voice came through comms. ""*I'm cycling the turret patterns now. They think they've learned our sequences, but I randomized them last night when I was bored.*"" 

""*You randomized our defensive patterns because you were bored?*"" Muaz sounded somewhere between impressed and horrified. 

""*Of course I was bored. This planet has absolutely terrible streaming access.*"" 

The north perimeter was a killing field by design—open approaches covered by overlapping fire zones, minimal cover, and enough sensor coverage that a Fed couldn't sneeze without us knowing. The attacking force had spread out more than last night's wave, using some kind of coordinated movement that suggested actual military training instead of just panicked zealotry. 

""Exterminators and military,"" I called, marking targets through my scope. ""Kolshian command element in the rear, Krakotl and Drezjin air support trying to circle, and—shit, are those Arxur bodies they're carrying?"" 

Through the scope I could see Fed troops—I zoomed in with the scope to see some quadraped with scarily long and thick tongues at the fore dragging the reptilian cargo-- hauling what looked like Arxur corpses, probably from some old battlefield. They were arranging them like... like shields? Totems? 

""*They're using dead Arxur as psychological warfare,""* Roland’s voice was flat over the comms. ""*Against us because we’re supposedly Predators and this is meant to scare us. Did not even a single intelligence officer in their ranks do the barest minimum of research or did they just assume we were all as savage as the lizards?*” 

""Right? Honestly, I’ve seen worse from New World Monkeys trying to make a point in turf wars."" Leo said and I agreed; some of the Traditionalist went pretty damn hard on the most minor of issues. It also didn’t help that they were using Arxur instead of Primates. 

""You alright, Lakun?” I asked out of politeness and professionalism “I now this might be hard for you.” 

“*Save your platitudes for the soft scaled, Ape.*” Lakun said, voice deeper and growling but also...excited? Eager? “*I’ve faced Prey before. This display is simply more motivation for their slaughter which is not needed but appreciated.*” 

I could almost hear his grin. Well, I almost felt bad for the Feds now. Almost.  

""Roland, I need firing solutions on that Kolshian command group. Muaz, you're on point when they breach. Leo, you and I are going to do a thing."" 

""Which thing?"" Leo's tail was practically vibrating with excitement. 

""A Gibraltar thing."" 

""Oh *hell yes.*"" 

""*I hate Prime damned Gibraltar things,*"" Commander Issa's voice cut in. ""*They always cost me ammunition and paperwork.*"" 

""Because they’re very effective,"" I countered, already moving into position. 

""*That's why I hate ‘em. Second Squad, you are cleared for defensive operations but if you destroy another FOB section, I swear to my* ***and*** *your ancestors I'm transferring all of you to latrine duty*."" 

The Feds hit our perimeter like a wave against stone. The automated turrets opened up first, railgun rounds punching through their front ranks with the relentless efficiency of machines that didn't care about concepts like mercy or proportional response. Bodies dropped, scattered, tried to reform ranks. 

That's when Muaz charged. 

The Gorilla moved like an avalanche with a vendetta, servo-assisted armor amplifying his already ridiculous strength into something that belonged in nightmare territory. A Gojid Exterminator tried to flame him and Muaz just grabbed the flamethrower, ripped it away, and beat the Gojid with it. The skull caved like dry tinder in a ruined pulp of blue. 

""*PRIMAL EXCELLENCE!*"" he roared, because apparently young Gorillas couldn't help making this theatrical. He followed up by throwing the Gojid into two of his friends hard enough to break bones through armor. 

""He's having fun,"" Leo observed. We were positioned on an elevated platform, watching the chaos unfold with professional appreciation. 

""He's demonstrating Primate capability,"" I said, watching as the young Bachelor ran into a Venlil, scooping them up and using their body to bash against an Exterminator. ""Very loudly."" 

The Feds tried to adapt, splitting their force to flank around Muaz's one-Gorilla wrecking crew. That's when Lakun hit them from the side, and I got to see what an Arxur raider actually looked like in combat instead of just hearing the horror stories. 

Fast. Brutally fast and impressively horrific in his violent glory. Lakun covered ground like gravity was a suggestion, claws tearing in gaps in Fed armor, teeth finding throats. No wasted movement, no hesitation. He'd done this before, probably hundreds of times, against species that were too fearful to shoot back. Now he was doing it against those that could and they weren't faring much better. 

A Krakotl dive-bombed him with some kind of plasma weapon and Lakun caught the bird, mid-flight, by the wing. The avian's scream cut off when Lakun slammed him into the ground hard enough to crack the rockcrete. A Takkan came barreling in with a cry and got run through with the Arxur’s blade for his troubles, Lakun twirling and nearly bisecting another Fed before chucking the body of the Krakotl like a stone as he leapt after it with a roar. His rifle, strapped to his back, went unfired. 

""Okay,"" Leo said, nodding in approval. ""That's decently terrifying. Very Primate-like honestly."" 

""Just decent?"" 

""We've faced Chimps before, remember?"" 

“Right, right.” Lakun was definitely a sight but he still fell short of the complete horror that were Chimps with proper motivation and a vendetta.  

The Fed command element was trying to coordinate a retreat; the Kolshians' tentacles gesturing frantically as they realized this was going about as well as all their previous assaults. Which is to say: badly. 

That's when they made their desperate gamble. 

Three Gojids broke from cover, sprinting directly at our position. Suicide run, had to be. They were carrying something—my optics flagged it as explosive, probably their version of a satchel charge. If they got close enough to the FOB's power coupling they might actually do some damage. 

""Leo,"" I said calmly. 

""I see them."" 

""You thinking what I'm thinking?"" 

""Oh, absolutely, brother."" His grin grew slightly manic as his tail lashed in short explicit laden Signage.  

We moved in sync, Bond Brothers for fifteen years and soldiers for eight. I lined up my shot on the lead Gojid's charge pack while Leo primed the subversion charges he'd planted around the perimeter last week ‘just in case’. 

""Roland, I need you to kill the turrets in sector seven for exactly four seconds."" 

""*Why would I—you're doing one of your Gibraltar things, aren't you?*"" 

""Four seconds. Please."" 

“*Europeans, I swear.*” A long-suffering sigh. ""*Turrets offline in three... two... one... mark.*"" 

I fired. The railgun round hit the Gojid's explosive pack with signiture Human accuracy, the detonation catching all three runners in a fireball that probably looked very dramatic. The blast wave also hit the exact sensor array that Leo had rigged with his charges, which detonated in sequence, which triggered the secondary explosions he'd also planted, which created a cascading chain reaction that— 

Well. It was very loud. And very bright. And when the smoke cleared there was a crater where about thirty Fed soldiers had been standing and no more command element because they'd been too close to their own troops. 

""*MACDONALD!*"" Commander Issa's roar came through comms. ""*LEO! WHAT DID I JUST SAY ABOUT BLOWING THINGS UP?*"" 

""You said not to blow up anything expensive. Those were Feds. They're not expensive, they're just expensive to kill because they keep coming back."" Leo said with admirable professionalism. 

*""That is NOT—you know what, I don't care. You two are on report. Again.*"" 

Worth it.  

I worked my rifle with the expertise of a lifetime’s practice, each shot a separate decision: Krakotl officer coordinating fire teams—pop, down. Gojid carrying what looked like demo charges—pop, explosive elimination. Venlil with a communication pack—pop, coordination disrupted. 

Beside me, Leo was working his own magic with the demolitions terminal, triggering charges in patterns that herded the Feds exactly where we wanted them. 

""*They're pulling back,*"" Lakun reported, and I could hear the disappointment. ""*Retreating to—wait.*"" 

""Wait what?"" 

""*They aren't retreating. They're repositioning. The retreat is a feint.*"" 

I checked my scope. Shit. He was right. The Feds pulling back were drawing our fire while another group—smaller, better equipped—was flanking around the south side. 

""Clever bastards,"" Leo muttered. 

The flanking group had demo charges. A lot of demo charges. They were going for our ammunition depot. 

If they hit that, we'd be fighting with harsh language and thrown rocks. Guess the Feds were actually learning from their repeated ass-kickings.  

""Leo,"" I said. 

""Yeah, I see them."" 

""You thinking what I'm thinking?"" 

""If you're thinking 'incredibly dangerous and probably against regulations,' then yes."" 

""Commander,"" I said into comms. ""Permission to execute Gibraltar Protocol Delta."" Because this was serious, I figured we pull out something suitable climatic.  

A long, long pause. Then Issa's weary voice: ""*You are going to give me an aneurysm. Do it.*"" 

""Lakun, Muaz, keep pressure on the main force. Roland, I need a fire corridor cleared on bearing two-seven-three."" 

""*That bearing has friendly positions—*"" 

""Not after you evacuate them. Thirty seconds."" 

Roland's exasperated sigh crackled across comms. ""*Why do I work with you people? Evacuating.*"" 

Leo was already setting up the chain. Gibraltar Protocols were technically classified as 'creative tactical innovations' and unofficially known as 'that thing the Gibraltar units do that command allows because it worked and hated because it was liable to make too much paperwork.""'

The principle for the Delta variant was simple: if you can't shoot the enemy, change the terrain so that *it* kills them for you. 

Leo had been planting charges all week. Not just around the FOB—that was basic defense. No, he'd been planting charges in that special Leo way where he looked at geography and saw opportunities for what he called ‘aggressive landscaping’. 

The south approach had a nice cliff face. Stable rock, wouldn't normally collapse. 

Unless someone had spent a week carefully placing shaped charges at every structural weakness point, turning solid stone into a trap waiting to spring. 

""Ready,"" Leo said, hands poised over the trigger. 

I watched through my scope. The Fed flanking team was right where we needed them, bunched up in the narrow approach at the cliff's base, focused on their objective. 

""Execute."" 

Leo hit the trigger. 

The cliff face didn't just collapse. It flowered outward in a precisely calculated cascade that turned several thousand tons of rock into the most aggressive avalanche this rock had probably ever since or at had seen in a while. The sound was incredible—a deep, earth-shaking roar that drowned out everything else. 

The Fed flanking team just... ceased to exist. One second they were there, the next they were geology. 

The main Fed force saw their flanking element get buried under a mountain and their morale just evaporated. They started a full retreat, discipline breaking down into a rout. 

""*Cease fire,*"" Issa ordered. ""*Let them run. No pursuit.*"" 

I lowered my rifle and turned to Leo, who was grinning like a madman. 

""That,"" I said, ""was beautiful."" 

""*That was excessive,*"" Roland's voice crackled. ""*You just changed the entire southern geography.*"" 

""Aggressive landscaping,"" Leo said cheerfully. ""I'm an artist."" 

""*You're a menace,*"" Lakun said, but there was something in his voice that might have been respect. ""*But why are we letting the Prey escape when we have the advantage?*"" 

“We’re not.” And almost as if on cue entire sections of the bombarded with sub-orbital satellite fire, Deepshaft-sourced munitions falling like atomic hail and ahnihilating the retreating force in a flowering display of explosions and light. “Command just wanted target practice for the new sate setup. How’d it do, Roland?” 

“*Within parameters, though the third bombardment was off by at least a few feet. I’ve already put in a calibration citation in my report.*” The Mouse Lemur said as he punched in data. 

Before I could say anything else, a loud sub-roar filled mine and my brother’s ears. 

""*MACDONALD. TRAVERSO. MY OFFICE. NOW.*"" Issa's voice had that special quality that suggested someone was about to get a very thorough ass-chewing. 

I grabbed my rifle. ""Worth it though."" 

""Absolutely worth it."" 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Issa's office was exactly as austere as you'd expect from a Baboon commander: functional furniture, tactical displays, and absolutely no personal decoration except for the Troop banner on one wall. 

The commander himself sat behind his desk, and the expression on his scarred face suggested he was calculating exactly how much paperwork our stunt had generated. 

""Sit,"" he said. 

We sat. 

""That was the single most excessive use of demolitions I have witnessed in thirty years of military service,"" Issa said flatly. ""You collapsed an entire cliff face. You altered the planetary geography. There is now a valley where there used to be a cliff."" 

""The enemy was using the cliff for cover,"" I said reasonably. 

""So you removed the cliff."" 

""Problem solving, a Primate specialty."" Leo added. 

Issa pinched the bridge of his nose. ""You realize this creates an incident report that will require at least a dozen separate forms?"" 

""We saved the ammunition depot,"" I pointed out. 

""By dropping a mountain on the enemy."" 

""Technically it was a cliff, not a mountain—"" 

""Macdonald."" 

""Sir."" 

""If you ever—and I mean ever—pull a stunt like that again without at least a ten-minute warning so I can prepare the paperwork..."" He paused. ""I will be forced to put a commendation in your file and I will hate every second of it."" 

I blinked. ""Sir?"" 

""You saved the depot. You neutralized a significant enemy force. You did it with minimal expenditure of ammunition and zero friendly casualties."" He looked at both of us. ""It was effective, efficient, and completely in line with Conclave tactical doctrine of achieving maximum impact with minimal resource expenditure."" 

""So... we're not in trouble?"" 

""Oh, you're absolutely in trouble. You gave me a dozen forms' worth of paperwork. But you're effective trouble."" He waved us toward the door. ""Get out. Go debrief with your unit. And Macdonald?"" 

""Sir?"" 

""Next time you want to redecorate a battlefield, at least make it pretty."" 

""Will do, sir."" 

We made it exactly three steps out of his office before Leo started laughing. 

""Told you it would work,"" he said. 

""Never doubted you for a second, brother."" 

We found the rest of the unit in the common area, where Roland was complaining about the quality of post-battle refreshments and Muaz was carefully cleaning his weapon. 

Lakun looked up as we entered. ""You were not executed?"" 

""Apparently we're too useful to execute,"" I said, dropping into a chair. 

""The cliff collapse was..."" the Arxur paused, clearly searching for words. ""Impressive. Wasteful, but impressive."" 

""Wasteful how?"" Leo asked, interested despite himself. 

""You buried significant salvageable enemy equipment. Federation weapons and armor have value."" Lakun made a gesture with one clawed hand. ""But tactically sound. The shock value alone probably demoralized the entire Prey force."" 

""That's the point,"" Roland said. ""Primates don't just win battles. We make the *idea* of fighting us seem pointless. Superior tactics, superior technology, superior creativity."" 

""Superior ego,"" I added. 

""That goes without saying."" The lemur said, his tone making it seem like a compliment. That was the Hegemony for you, I guessed.  

Muaz finally looked up from his weapon. ""The demolition was within acceptable risk parameters?"" 

""Barely,"" I admitted. ""If Leo's calculations had been off by even a few degrees, we might have brought the cliff down on our own position."" 

""They were not off,"" Leo said confidently. ""I spent a week surveying that rock face. I knew exactly how it would fall."" 

""You hoped you knew how it would fall,"" Roland corrected. 

""Same thing when you're good at your job."" 

I leaned back in my chair, feeling the post-combat adrenaline finally starting to wear off. My coffee had gone cold hours ago but I sipped it anyway, watching my unit bicker and banter with the easy familiarity of people who'd kept each other alive through some genuinely terrible situations. 

Lakun, still integrating but starting to find his place. Roland, complaining constantly but performing flawlessly when it mattered. Muaz, young and earnest but learning fast. And Leo, my bond-brother, partner in chaos, the Macaque half of a seven-thousand-year tradition of Gibraltar humans and Macaques watching each other's backs. 

""You know,"" I said to no one in particular, ""the Feds really should have just left us alone."" 

""Too late now,"" Leo said. ""They keep sticking their noses into our business and we’ve got no choice but to keep lobbing it off til they get the message."" 

""And they are terrified,"" Lakun said with a nod. ""As they should be. You may be leaf-lickers, but you are very *competent* ones."" 

Roland raised his cup of terrible coffee in a mock toast. ""To Primate superiority and Federation stupidity."" 

""I'll drink to that,"" I said. 

We did. 

Outside, the sun climbed higher over Hallowed-7, burning away the morning mist and illuminating the fresh ruins of the battlefield. Tomorrow the Feds would probably try again, because they were nothing if not persistent. 

And tomorrow we'd be here, ready to demonstrate once again why declaring war on Primates was the worst decision the Federation ever made. 

But that was tomorrow's problem. 

Today, we'd defended our position, saved our depot, and collapsed a cliff on our enemies. 

By Gibraltar standards, that was a pretty good day's work. 

*And so begins the exploits of our first action crew. What did you think of this one? I’m experimenting with different writing styles so I apologize if this was a bit wonky in places but I did have fun writing it. So, what did you think of the crew? Who did you like and what do you expect them to get up to next?*  

*Also, some tidbits: Gibraltar Humans and Barbary Macaques are a naturally occurring example of species alliance that stretches back some 7,000 years, making it the longest alliance in Primate history and as a result Barbary Macaques are more Human-like than other Macaques who find them far more chaotic and disorganized than they expect or find tolerable in many cases.*  

*Humans in this setting have a universal culture around tattoos with pretty much every Human having ink over most of their bodies. While some are so vanity or aesthetics, many are more practical and tell you information about a person’s life and history as well as their allegiances, connections, family groups, occupation, romantic and sexual history and much more. Humans who do not possess little to no ink are treated with suspicion and seen as uncanny to other Humans as they are considered ‘blank’ and unreadable.*

### 🐾 I stopped doing this *one* thing — and my dog’s behavior changed completely.

Sunday morning, leash in hand, I realized my dog wasn’t being “disobedient.”  
He was overwhelmed.  
I was *the noise* in our relationship.

For months, every walk turned into a tug-of-war. I’d repeat commands, raise my voice a little, try to “show I meant it.”  
But what I was really teaching him… was to tune me out.

One day I just stopped.  
I stopped **repeating commands.** I stopped **showing frustration.**  
I stopped trying to *control* every move — and started communicating calmly, slowly, once.

The result?  
He became a completely different dog.  
Less anxious. More focused. Happier.

That’s when it clicked — dogs don’t misbehave to test you.  
They simply mirror the energy you lead with.

So I dug deep into how communication and energy shape behavior (not dominance, not punishment).  
It completely reframed how I approach training — without yelling, without endless “sit-stay” battles.

If you’ve been struggling with leash pulling, barking, or just feeling like your dog *doesn’t listen*… there’s a better way.

👉 **[Here’s the free Dog Training course + giveaway I tried](https://cashflowmanifest.com/dogtrainner)**  
Real-world tactics, less frustration, and 100% positive reinforcement based.  

It covers what fixed everything for me:  
• How to build trust instead of tension  
• Why “calm leadership” works better than authority  
• How 10 minutes a day transforms behavior faster than forcing it

A calmer dog starts with a calmer human — I had to learn that the hard way.  
Now every walk feels like a conversation instead of a battle.

If your dog’s energy feels chaotic or anxious right now, don’t wait to fix it.  
Those habits only get deeper with time.

This isn’t for “perfect” trainers. It’s for regular owners who just want to stop stressing and start actually enjoying life with their dog.

And honestly? Seeing him trust me again made everything worth it.

**Title:** Has anyone else tried *The Brain Song*? Does it really work or is it just another mindset gimmick?

Hey everyone,  

Okay, hear me out. I’ve been in the ""try-everything-to-focus"" phase lately—coffee, apps, affirmations, morning routines, the works. But then I stumbled upon this thing called *The Brain Song*. Supposedly, it helps align your brain waves with certain sounds to improve focus, motivation, and even income mindset.  

Here’s the link I found: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**  

Now, I’ll be honest—I was skeptical. I mean, how could *music* help me get better at online work? But after giving it a shot for a couple of days while doing my freelancing tasks, I did notice something strange... it *actually* helped me tune out distractions. Maybe placebo, maybe science—I’m not totally sure yet.  

I’m curious if anyone here has experimented with sound or frequency-based mindset tools. Things like this have such mixed reviews—half believers, half skeptics. I’d love to hear stories, especially from people who do freelancing, digital work, or hustle online. Sometimes it’s not about finding another strategy, but resetting how the brain *works* while chasing those online income goals.  

If you’re curious, check it out for yourself here: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**  
Even if it ends up being a placebo, it’s a peaceful one.  

I’ll keep journaling my experience—maybe it turns out to be a small hack that changes the way I approach focus, creativity, and money flow. If you’ve tried it too, let’s talk results. Was it noise or magic?  

Lastly, if you're bored and want something new for your productivity playlist—just in case—it’s here again: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**  

Stay curious and keep experimenting. Sometimes progress hides in the weird corners of the internet.

\*\*Disconnected\*\*

\*Or:  The Girl Who Couldn’t Stop Performing\*

\---

**\*\*OPENING IMAGE:\*\***

MADISON CHEN, 16, sits in her school cafeteria.

She's arranging her lunch.

Not to eat it.

To photograph it.

Except there's no camera.

She does it anyway.

Adjusts the apple. Straightens the sandwich. Perfect composition.

Then she picks up her fork and starts eating.

Her friend ARIA watches, confused.

 

ARIA: ""What are you doing?""

MADISON: (defensive) ""Nothing.""

ARIA: ""You were staging your lunch.""

MADISON: ""No I wasn't.""

ARIA: ""Madison. There's no phone. Nobody's taking a picture.""

MADISON: ""I *know* that.""

Beat.

MADISON: ""I just... forgot.""

**Six months since the LOS.**

The school cafeteria is wrong in ways nobody has language for yet.

 No phones on the tables. No blue light on faces.

Kids actually talk to each other, words stumbling and dying halfway across the plastic trays.

Some sit in silence, staring at the blank space where their screens used to be. A few clutch real books like props from a school play.

The rest just … exist, shoulders hunched, eyes unfocused, waiting for something that doesn’t buzz anymore.

 

Madison keeps doing phantom phone checks.

Hand to pocket. Nothing.

A tiny shock under her ribs. She drags her hand away, presses her palm flat on the table.

Two minutes later, her fingers drift back toward her jeans again. She doesn’t even notice.

**THE THERAPY SESSION:**

The school has mandatory ""adjustment counseling.""

Madison sits across from MR. REEVES, 50s, tired.

 

MR. REEVES: ""How are you sleeping?""

MADISON: (lying) ""Fine.""

MR. REEVES: ""No doom-scrolling at 2am anymore. That should help.""

MADISON: ""I guess.""

MR. REEVES: ""Your grades are up.""

MADISON: ""Yeah.""

MR. REEVES: ""You're paying attention in class now. Teachers say you're engaged.""

MADISON: ""Uh-huh.""

MR. REEVES: ""So why do you seem... angry about that?""

Madison shifts uncomfortably.

MADISON: ""I'm not angry.""

MR. REEVES: ""Madison, you're doing *better*. Objectively better. But you look miserable.""

MADISON: ""I'm fine.""

MR. REEVES: ""Before the LOS, you were anxious, depressed, sleep-deprived. Your mom told me you were on your phone six, seven hours a day. Now you're—""

MADISON: (sharp) ""I had fourteen thousand followers.""

Silence.

MR. REEVES: ""Okay.""

MADISON: ""I was *somebody*.""

MR. REEVES: ""You're still somebody.""

MADISON: ""No. I'm just... this."" (gestures at herself with disgust)

MR. REEVES: ""Most of your peers are adjusting. Some are even—""

MADISON: ""They're *pretending*. They miss it too. They just won't admit it.""

MR. REEVES: ""Do they?""

Madison doesn't answer.

Because she's starting to realize: maybe they don't.

\---

**THE FRIEND GROUP:**

Madison's former ""influencer crew"" meets at lunch.

Five girls who used to coordinate outfits for Instagram.

Now they're just... five girls eating lunch.

 

SOPHIA: ""Did you guys see the sunset last night?""

ARIA: ""Yeah, it was gorgeous.""

MADISON: (automatic) ""Did you get a pic—"" (stops herself) ""Sorry.""

SOPHIA: ""I just... looked at it. It was nice.""

MADISON: ""You didn't document it?""

SOPHIA: ""Why would I?""

MADISON: ""So you'd... remember it?""

ARIA: ""I remember it. I was there. I saw it with my eyes.""

Madison looks disturbed by this concept.

MADISON: ""But if you didn't capture it, did it even—""

JENNA: (interrupting) ""Mad, we've been over this. Things can happen without being posted.""

MADISON: ""I *know* that.""

But she doesn't sound convinced.

SOPHIA: ""I'm sleeping so much better now. Like, eight hours a night. It's weird.""

ARIA: ""Same! And I'm not anxious all the time. Like, I forgot what it felt like to just... be calm.""

JENNA: ""My skin cleared up. I think it was the stress.""

They're all nodding, agreeing.

Madison feels like she's in the Twilight Zone.

MADISON: ""You guys are *happy* about this?""

SOPHIA: ""I mean... yeah? Aren't you?""

MADISON: ""The solar flares destroyed our entire way of life.""

ARIA: ""Madison, our 'way of life' was staring at screens for seven hours a day and feeling like shit about ourselves.""

MADISON: ""That's not—""

JENNA: ""I compared myself to photoshopped models every single day. I had panic attacks over like counts. I cried because a post didn't go viral. That was *insane*.""

MADISON: ""But we were *connected*. We had *reach*. We mattered to thousands of people.""

ARIA: ""We didn't matter to them. They didn't even know us.""

SOPHIA: ""Now I have, like, five real friends. That's enough.""

Madison looks at them like they've been brainwashed.

MADISON: ""You've given up.""

JENNA: ""We've moved on.""

Over the next few days, Madison watches.

Sophia butchers chords in the music room, fingers slipping, grinning anyway as the guitar wheezes along.

 

Aria lives in the pottery studio now, wrists deep in clay, laughing at every lopsided bowl that survives the wheel.

Jenna runs laps after school with no one aiming a camera at her, just the slap of her shoes and her own breath for company.

In the library, clusters of kids lean over board games, arguing about rules, slamming pieces down like it matters.

On the blacktop, a pickup game of basketball runs long; nobody’s filming, nobody’s posing—just squeaking shoes and trash talk.

In the art room, paint and glue and glitter explode across paper, projects destined for the bin instead of a feed.

The drama club actually rehearses lines—badly—without pausing to check angles.

Madison stands at the edge of it all, taking mental notes like an anthropologist watching a new species learn how to live. 

The wind picks up, spinning dead leaves around Madison’s shoes and carrying a faint trace of lilacs from somewhere beyond the parking lot.

She watches Sophia’s crooked chords, Aria’s lopsided bowls, Jenna’s steady stride. They look ridiculous. They look…happy.

Maybe she could try ridiculous. Just once.

The next day, she signs up for pottery.

 

She sits at the wheel, legs bouncing, a lump of clay waiting in front of her.

She presses her fingers into it, then stops.

“What’s the point if no one sees it?” she asks the spinning gray blur.

Aria looks over, wrists slick with slip. “The point is you made it.”

Madison wipes her hands on the apron, stands, and walks out before the clay can take shape.

**THE PARENTS**  

Madison's house, dinner table.

For the first time in years, they're eating together.

Not because of new family values.

Because there's nothing else to do.

MOM: ""How was school?""

MADISON: (sullen) ""Fine.""

DAD: ""Your teacher emailed—wait, no, she called. She said you're doing really well in English now.""

MADISON: ""I guess.""

MOM: ""You seem upset about that.""

MADISON: ""I'm not upset.""

DAD: ""You know, when I was your age, we didn't have phones. We just... talked to each other. Hung out. It was fine.""

MADISON: (eye roll) ""Okay, boomer.""

MOM: ""He's Gen-X, actually, and he's right. You kids are adapting. It's impressive.""

MADISON: ""We didn't have a *choice*.""

DAD: ""Neither did we. The flares fried everything. But we're rebuilding. And in the meantime—""

MADISON: ""In the meantime I have to exist without proving I exist.""

Her parents exchange a look.

MOM: ""Honey, you exist whether you post about it or not.""

MADISON: ""You don't understand.""

DAD: ""Then explain it to us.""

Madison tries. Fails. Gets frustrated.

MADISON: ""Forget it.""

She leaves the table.

Her parents sit in silence.

MOM: ""She talked to us for five whole minutes. That's more than the last three years combined.""

DAD: ""Progress?""

MOM: ""Maybe.""

\---

**THE PLAN:**

Madison can’t accept this.  
Everyone’s moving on.  
Everyone’s healing.

Everyone except her.

They act fine without it now.  
But they still glance at their empty hands, at bare walls, at nothing.  
They miss it. They have to.

She needs to prove it.  
Prove they need it too.  
Prove they’re just better liars.

She can’t bring back the phones.  
Fine.

She’ll bring back the feeling.  
The performance.  
The validation.  
The numbers.

She’ll build a new place for it to live.

A wall.

  


**THE WALL:**

Madison spends the whole weekend building it.  
On Monday, a massive corkboard looms over the cafeteria, swallowing an entire wall.

It’s divided into sections:  
“POSTS” – loose-leaf pages and notebook scraps, already waiting with thumbtacks.  
“STORIES” – a smaller square, labeled “TODAY ONLY.”  
“COMMENTS” – space under “POSTS,” lined with empty pins.

She drags a chair into the middle of the room and clears her throat.

“Okay,” Madison says, louder than she means to. “If you want to share something, post it here. If you like a post, add a heart sticker. If you want to comment, pin a note below.”

Heads turn. Trays pause halfway to mouths.

Aria squints at the board. “Madison… why?”

“Because we need connection,” Madison says, words getting faster. “We need to share. We need community.”

Jenna, still in her track jacket, gestures around the room. “We have community. We’re talking to each other.”

“This is better,” Madison says. “This is organized. This is—”

Sophia cuts in. “This is sad.”

Madison looks past her, focusing on the blank cork, and pretends she didn’t hear.

\---

**THE FIRST DAY:**

The first day, the Wall gets… some activity.

A couple of curious freshmen wander over and pin things—doodles, “hi,” a lopsided poem. A few older kids add joke posts, all irony and fake enthusiasm.

 

Madison posts constantly.

“Great lunch today! Anyone else love apples? 🍎 #blessed #healthyeating #lunchgoals”  
“Loving this weather ☀️ Perfect day to be alive! #grateful #sunshine #vibes”  
“Can’t wait for Friday! Big plans! #weekend #excited”

She has no plans.

Nobody responds. No hearts, no comments, just paper curling slightly at the corners.

After a minute, Madison scribbles a note and pins it under her own post:  
“Wow this is so inspiring! You’re amazing!”

Same handwriting. Same pen.

No one points it out. No one says anything at all.

Late in the day, long after the cafeteria closed, a student hovers near the wall reading Madison’s posts carefully.  The student shrugs a backpack off one shoulder, fingers lingering on the straps, then walks away without adding anything.

\---

**THE SECOND WEEK:**

By the second week, the Wall is dying.  
Two, maybe three new posts a day. None of them hers.

Madison is the only one still posting regularly.  
She starts writing comments on her own notes from “anonymous supporters.”

Everyone recognizes her handwriting. No one calls her on it.

Aria finds her there between classes. “Mad, maybe it’s time to take it down.”

“It’s catching on,” Madison says. “People just need time to adjust.”

“Nobody wants this,” Aria says, soft but firm.

“You’re wrong.” Madison stares at the cork, not at her.

Aria isn’t wrong.

\---

**THE THIRD WEEK:**

The third week, someone finally posts something that isn’t Madison. A single note, small and earnest: “This is weird. Please stop.”

Madison plucks it down the moment her eyes land on it. “Negative content doesn’t belong here,” she murmurs to herself, resetting the thumbscrew like a mod policing her own delusion.

After school that day, her friends corner her by the bike racks.

  
“We’re worried about you,” Sophia says.

  
“I’m fine,” Madison answers.

  
“You’re not fine,” Jenna says. “You’re stuck.”

  
“I’m the only one who hasn’t given up,” Madison fires back.

  
“Given up on what?” Aria asks. “On being miserable?”

  
“You guys were somebody online,” Madison says. “Now you’re just… normal.”

  
“Yeah,” Sophia says. “And it’s better.”

  
“You’re lying to yourselves.”

  
But Jenna looks at her with calm eyes. “I don’t wake up anxious anymore,” she says. “I don’t compare myself to strangers. I am just…me.”

Madison’s hands clench. “You needed that validation too. We were all…hooked on something that didn’t love us back.”

  
“We were,” Aria says. “And now we’re not. That’s the point.”

  
“I don’t want to be ‘not validated’,” Madison says. “I want to be seen.”

  
“We see you,” Sophia says. “Right now. In person.”

  
“It’s not the same,” Madison mutters.

  
“Why not?”

Madison can’t answer.

\---

**THE COLLAPSE:**

One month after The Wall went up, Madison is still posting.

Daily updates. Inspirational quotes. Drawings of herself.

Zero engagement except her own fake accounts.

The cafeteria tables around that corner sit empty despite the lunch‑hour hum. Students angle toward the opposite side of the room, giving the board a wide berth, eyes sliding past it like it might be contagious.

It’s become pathetic.

Everyone knows it.

Including Madison.

But she can’t stop.

\---

**THE ENCOUNTER:**

LUCAS approaches Madison.

He's one of the ""Void Kids""—never had social media, homeschooled until recently, completely unaffected by the Severing.

LUCAS: ""Hey.""

MADISON: (defensive) ""What?""

LUCAS: ""You okay?""

MADISON: ""I'm fine.""

LUCAS: ""You're posting about your breakfast on a corkboard that nobody reads.""

MADISON: ""People read it.""

LUCAS: ""No they don't.""

Madison's hands shake.

MADISON: ""Why do you care?""

LUCAS: ""I don't know. You seem... stuck.""

MADISON: ""I'm not stuck. I'm committed.""

LUCAS: ""To what?""

MADISON: ""To not forgetting who I was.""

LUCAS: ""Who were you?""

MADISON: ""I was... I mattered. I had reach. I had influence.""

LUCAS: ""Over who?""

MADISON: ""Thousands of people.""

LUCAS: ""Did you know any of them?""

MADISON: ""That's not the point.""

LUCAS: ""What is the point?""

Madison realizes she doesn't know.

LUCAS: ""Everyone else is moving on. Why can't you?""

MADISON: (breaking) ""Because if I move on, then it was all for nothing. All those hours. All that anxiety. All that... performance. If I just let it go, then I wasted years of my life on something that didn't matter.""

LUCAS: ""So you'd rather keep wasting time now?""

Madison has no response.

LUCAS: ""You're allowed to feel better, you know. It's not betraying who you were. It's just... becoming someone new.  And besides, who you were was miserable.""

MADISON: ""I don't know how to be someone new.""

LUCAS: ""Nobody does. That's the point.""

He walks away.

Madison stands alone in front of The Wall.

\---

**FINAL IMAGE:**

Two weeks later, The Wall is still up.

But it’s not Madison’s Wall anymore.

Notes now sit in neat columns: class summaries, quiz reminders, study‑group times. A “Lost & Found” section swells with crumpled notes about forgotten hoodies and missing calculators. Someone has taped up printed schedules for after‑school tutoring and volunteer hours. The whole corner hums with a low, functional energy, like the Wall suddenly remembered it’s supposed to be useful.

Madison’s old captions have been peeled down. Holes where photos once pinned sit like tiny sunspots in the cork. The ghosts of her #blessed and #grateful are gone, replaced by practical truths written in different hands.

She sits alone at lunch.

Writing in a journal.

ARIA: (approaching cautiously) ""What are you writing?""

MADISON: ""Nothing.""

ARIA: ""Can I sit?""

Madison shrugs.

Aria flips through them.

Some dated from months ago.

All formatted like Instagram captions.

""2/18: Beautiful sunrise this morning ☀️ Feeling grateful #blessed""

""2/19: Coffee tastes better when you're present ☕ #mindfulness""

""2/20: Sometimes you just need to breathe 🧘 #wellness""

Aria closes the journal gently.

ARIA: ""You know, we still want to hang out with you. We just... can't watch you destroy yourself over something that's gone.""

MADISON: (Screaming) “You don’t know anything. You don’t know what it is like to be invisible!”

ARIA: (Quietly) “You don’t have to yell. I am standing right here.”

MADISON: (Suddenly going cold and robotic) I don’t see you.  Your comment has been flagged for community guideline violations “

ARIA: Madison, stop.  What are you even talking about?”

MADISON: (Picks up her sharpie and draws a jagged “X” on her journal).  “You have been blocked…”

ARIA: (Flinches, pulling her hand back) “Whatever Madsion.  You’re just…you’re so pathetic.”

Aria turns her back, her boots thudding against the floorboards as she walks toward the light of the courtyard where the other students are gathered. 

Madison doesn’t watch her go.  She doesn’t even look up.

She pauses, her finger hovering over the paper as if waiting for a “Like” to bloom under her touch.  When the paper remains white and silent, she draws a tiny, perfect heart next to her own sentence.

MADISON: (A faint, shaking smile) “Don’t worry, guys.  I’m still here.  I’m still “the” Madison.

She closes the journal with a sharp snap, clutching it to her chest like a shield.  Outside, someone laughs – a real, unedited, unrecorded sound – and Madison flinches as if the noise is a glitch, she can’t quite mute.

\---

**THE END.**

Madison Chen wanted to be seen.  To matter.  To exist in the eyes of thousands. But when the grid collapsed, she discovered something: the mirrors went dark.  Consider Madison, and all the Disconnected – lost not in the wilderness, but in the space between who they performed to be…and who they actually are.  Without reflection, Madison continued to perform, to post, to seek validation.  Welcome to the Signals.",1,1771010707.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

This review is going to be even less of a review and more of a ""book babble"" than normal. Picture this, you and me at a coffee shop☕ You ask if I've read anything good lately, I say ""Tress of The Emerald Sea"" was wonderful! You ask my what I liked about it, and you see me doing that internal ""how much do I go into this"" struggle. But we're friends, so you know in the end I'm going all in. And you think to yourself, here we go, Christina is about to go full Christina. 



So the best thing I've heard said about this book was from ""u/maya.m.reads"" she said ""This book is kind of like Princess Bride but in reverse"". And that's so perfect. It's as warm, engaging, fairytale like, and endearing as the princess pride. Only in this one the Prince goes missing, and our heroine (a window washer instead of a farmboy) sets out to save him. It's absolutely wonderful, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. You should definitely go read her full review of the book, it's beautiful. Also, her book pictures are 🤌🩷🫶

But here's the thing, this book is about more than this book for me. This story is a bookmark in my life. I read this book for book club, a book club I almost didn't go to. My heart has been so heavy, my anxiety like a hungry beast never leaving me, just watching from the shadows waiting. My anger like an unwelcome itch on a raw spot of skin. 



And I wonder, should I be escaping into books right now? Is it okay to be happy sometimes right now? Does my laughter mock the pain, suffering, and injustice that seems to be drowning the world right now? 



I think so? I think that community, especial local community, is the foundation of how we push back against the hate, the injustice, and the evil. 



So I went to book club, it was amazing. Did we talk politics? No. Did we plan the revolution? No. Did we make friends, exchange contact information, keep in touch? Yes. We check in. We send memes, mostly book memes, sometimes cats and F\*CK ICE art. And without saying it directly, we remind each other that our grief and rage are shared. We are not alone And that's not nothing.

1r3ybvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1r3ybvy/a_month_sober_how_im_feeling/,"a month sober, how im feeling","i did it! im a month sober.

prior to this, i was blacking out almost everyday on cheap beer or wine, lost my job because i got super drunk while working and then, didnt get out of my home for around 1-2 months. i was drinking alone and crying and looking at myself in the mirror with disgust. sometimes spent more than a week without showering.

my thoughts get hard to deal with at times. in peak addiction (i have been an alcoholic/drug addict for many years, had different peaks) i have slept in the streets, fought people, destroyed relationships, robbed, prostituted myself, disappeared, tried suicide twice etc etc. so i feel very ashamed and guilty. and some of my worst moments keep replaying in my head.

all this said, im lucky enough to have a family that loves me and is able to support me. i just spent 3 weeks in my home country in south america. spent some time with loved ones and some alone in the mountains and disconnected from the world. only me, my thoughts, my journal and books. and lots of coffee.

the first week wasnt easy, i was extremely anxious and irritable. i had horrible nightmares and headache and sweating profusely. but i stuck through it and i started feeling lighter by day 10. mind you, this is not my first time attempting sobriety, ive lived this cycle many times before. every failure makes it harder to believe in myself, my internal dialogue looks like ""yeah i feel like its gonna stick this time! but who am i fooling? i always end up drinking anyways"", but hey at least i keep trying, right?

now 1 month in. im leaving tonight to go back home and im scared of the loneliness awaiting me. im feeling so much better and so capable of living an alcohol free life. hanging out with my cousins sober showed me that im still able to laugh, cry, and have meaningful conversations. i feel smarter and confident. i feel better in my body. but im scared as soon as im all alone with myself i will say: fuck it, and drink. although im not craving it as of right now. maybe its just force of habit.

i have plans for when i come back: work out, eat well, call my family more often, accept to hang out with people, look for a job, try doing more activities to keep myself busy.

i love myself and i love living in my head for the first time in a long time. but i still have that monkey on my back, will it be there forever? i will try to stay strong. sending lots of love to everyone fighting this battle ❤️",44,1771010285.0,stopdrinking,6,0.99,False

1r3y9gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverwhisky/comments/1r3y9gr/eastern_exploring/,Eastern Exploring,"Decided to switch things up today and not do my usual run on the south side starting with TW, and hit the southeast corner of Aurora instead.

**Iliff Liquors** - Interesting small shop nestled in an apartment complex.  Behind the counter EHT SiB $99 (not a horrible price actually), WA107 $130, Stagg $135.

**Buckley Discount Liquors** - As I roll up two tweakers were dancing to nonexistent music in the parking lot right in front of the shop.  If you're that lit at 8:30am you're probably not there to share bourbon hunting tips.  Decided to just head to my next stop, as I hadn't had enough coffee yet to potentially have an annoying encounter.  Of course, that means there were probably numerous cases of Van Winkle and BTAC out at MSRP, LOL.

**AZ Liquor (wildcard stop)** - This shop looked tiny and attached to a convenience store, but was actually a pleasant surprise with prices that were somewhat decent for some bottles.  Stagg $100, ETL $100, EHT SiB/SmB/Straight Rye just said $100 under all of them, Blanton's $100, ER10 $60. Thought it was gonna be a Wellerpalooza for me, but W12 and WFP were priced at $170, oh well.

**Camelot Liquors (wildcard stop)** - Most of the same bottles that AZ had, but worse pricing: EHT SiB $120, ER12 $190, ETL $170, WA107 $130, Stagg $160, Blanton's $130.

**Foxfield Wine & Spirits** - Never had much luck here, and the trend continued. They have a Maker's Keeper for $150 (LOL), Blanton's $150 (really?), and WA107 behind the counter for $190.

**Davidson's Centennial** - Drove right on by it as usual, same thing I do for Molly's Arapahoe.

**Piney Creek Liquors** - Not much just ER10 for $65 and W12 for $200.

**Cherry Creek Liquors (wildcard stop)** - ER10 $80, ETL $150, JJB SiB $80, WA107 $150, WSR 750ml $80 (LOL),  Blanton's $150.  These prices felt like stepping back into 2021-2022.

**Chambers Wine & Liquor** - Right away I spot a single bottle of Blanton's for $87 and also WA107 in the case for $67.  Asked them to get the WA107 for me, then tried to ask if they had any more, but the guy grabbing it worked in wine, so he had no idea.  By the register, they have cases and cases of well-priced Saz/BT stuff: EHT SmB $60, ER10 $48, ER10 handles $79 (I think?), and of course WSR for $27.  Given all that stuff out, I'd be very surprised if they don't have more WA107 for the asking, especially since their delivery day is generally late Thursday or early Friday.

**Iliff Crossing Liquors** - Have had great luck here in the past, but not today, EHT BP $199, ETL $160.

**Bevy's Parker** - Not much other than regular BT bourbon handles for $55 and Old Forester 1924 still on the shelf.  I also noticed they still had a few Early Times 1L BiB blue cap bottles on sale for $21, so I grabbed one.  Apparently, the folding of the Early Times acquisition into Sazerac is now complete.  Early Times BiB will now be sold in 750ml square bottles (Benchmark bottles, actually) for about $5 more than before, and the contents are now 100% Barton.  

This new Early Times BiB bottling/formulation got absolutely ripped apart in reviews this week by The Mash and Drum and SLB Drinks.  You could tell they were trying not to piss off BT/Sazerac, but they were both really unhappy with the change.  So beware the new squarish Early Times BiB bottles, and if you enjoy ET BiB and see a black or blue-capped round 1L bottle for a good price, you may want to grab one (or a few) for yourself while they are still around.",21,1771010134.0,denverwhisky,9,0.92,False

1r3y5a7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3y5a7,Sophie’s Style in S4 E1-4,"I have no particular expertise in Korean traditional costume so apologies if I get any specifics wrong. 

I love storytelling through costume and Bridgerton is pretty good at this. Sophie presents an interesting challenge as the character’s station in life sees her dressed in other people’s choices - via uniforms or borrowed dresses. However I think the wardrobe department has found neat ways to have Sophie customise *how* she wears these clothes to allow for self-expression. And maybe a little foreshadowing here and there?

**Collars**

All the female servants wear collars/scarves across the chest/clavicle. Sophie’s collar is worn higher than most, something she explains in the show as being needed to cover her pendant. Practical reasoning aside, the visual result is that Sophie’s neckline becomes reminiscent of a *Hanbok* neckline, a traditional Korean dress. It’s the bigger overlap, rather than the small overlap needed for a lower collar and more pointed V shape.

**Caps**

At the Bridgerton house, maids wear caps, which are folded and sit at the front of the head. Sophie’s folding method results in a notably smaller cap than those worn by other maids. It is framed by her hair and the personal tweak makes Sophie’s headgear reminiscent of a traditional Korean bridal headpiece: *Jokduri*

**Important Note**: there is absolutely nothing I could find indicating that a Jokduri would also be used as a traditional Korean *mistress* headpiece, looking at you Benedict Bridgerton

**Hair**

How Sophie wears her hair behind her cap is also interesting as it gives a couple of possible nods. Firstly, the Jokduri itself again, either via the very traditional black version or how hair can be styled behind a modern one to frame the headpiece. 

Secondly, more tenuous but interesting, it could be a nod to Sophie’s social status / future status. In the episode in which Sophie wears her hair like this, the only other character who does the exact same is Lady Danbury. Lots of women in the show wear their hair piled up e.g. the queen’s preferred style. However these women generally soften it via ringlets that frame the face. The only characters in this episode that have almost identical tightly woven braids, which are twirled onto the crown of the head and completely slicked or swooped back from the face, are The Dowager Countess Lady Danbury (wedded to an Earl) and Sophie Baek (ex-ward of and daughter to an Earl).

**Robes** 

Finally, just another small style choice - nightwear. The My Cottage location sees both Sophie and Benedict in nightgowns and dressing gowns/housecoats. Benedict’s style does seem to echo Korean styles, however I could not find another male Bridgerton character for comparison, so unsure to what particular extent. This season, though, there is at least Francesca to compare with Sophie. Obviously decisions about character costumes are layered with meaning, there is no single thing to be inferred. In this instance Francesca’s robe is tightly drawn in the presence of her husband as she fulfils her societal role, while Sophie’s is loose in the presence of Benedict as they blur the lines. Take what you will from that! However, Sophie’s personal decisions in *how* she wears her borrowed clothes also once again nudge her to resemble Korean styles, this time more in the resulting silhouette which is not contoured to the body. (I also really feel like there’s a film nod or two in both Benedict & Sophie’s tortured-romantics-on-a-dark-and-stormy-night looks but I can’t put my finger on it, maybe there’s nothing specific).

I’m sure there are loads of other little references, these are just a few that jumped out. The Hanbok and Empire line styles really complement each other via the bustline, so looking forward to whenever we get to see Sophie in clothes she has had made entirely for herself, what’s her own style? 

Also please please *please* I am begging that production release a coffee table book all about the costumes of Bridgerton. Would absolutely love to read what went into the designs and how they relate to plot lines, personalities, relationships, heritage and history. With lots of big pictures.

- About: Adds classic physics based miscellaneous items to Fallout 4.


Adds a bunch of classic miscellaneous items from Fallout 3, all built from scratch and intended to match the originals faithfully. 

For this project I wanted to make a bunch of classic miscellaneous items from Fallout 3. Though, with a focus on physics interactivity. Essentially, where appropriate I have added various physics elements to each of the objects. For example the lid on the coffee pot flips open and closed, the head on the office fan rotates and spins, the handle on the bucket rotates, as well as the wooden grip attached to the handle spins, the microphone on the typewriter rotates, the bread holder arms on the toaster flop, the microscope rotates within its holder, the suitcase can be flipped open and closed and the wheels on the toy car and Nuka-truck are functional, so if you place them on a hill they will roll down it.

This mod is mostly intended for people (like myself) who enjoy decorating their homes in Fallout games with all of the stuff they find out in the wastes. With the added twist that if you pick one of the items up they can be interacted with in a fun way. 

How to obtain:
All of the items can be crafted at a Chemistry station, within the Classic Miscellaneous Items section. The items can also on a rare occasion spawn out in the world within containers.

For a few of the items I have produced some variants. For example, there is a locked and unlocked variant of the suitcase and toasters. I also decided to create some variants of the telephone, one standard and one broken up into its individual parts. Which has been built with accurate collision, meaning you can place the phone of the telephone onto its holder. Some of the items also have variants in the form of a painted seafoam green or pastel yellow, as well as a selection of different vase designs. All the 3D models were produced by me.",1,1771009578.0,verifiedcreations,0,1.0,False

- About: Liven up your settlements and player homes with new workshop build options for placeable animations, and directly buildable NPC residents.


Adds two new major options to the workshop build menu at settlements, player homes, and encampments - Activators and Residents.

Activators allow you to build invisible markers for NPCs to interact with creating more lively locations. They fall into the following categories:

* Idle markers linked to specific animations (see available list below) that NPCs will randomly engage with, triggering the animation outside of work hours or when unassigned.
* Animated scavenging markers that settlers are directly allocated to to perform the animation while collecting junk (settlements only)
* Store markers equivalent to standard tier 1/2/3 vendors stalls of all types (settlements only)
* Guard marker equivalent to a standard guard post (settlements only)

Residents are NPCs that are directly placed in workshop mode (ie ‘built’). Rather than being allocated to a range of tasks like settlers, residents automatically fill a roll at the location they are built in. Resident fall into the following categories:

* Adult and child standard residents that provide a small amount of food and happiness and move around the area engaging with furniture and idle markers.
* Sentry guards which provide defence to a settlement and stay close to where they are placed.
* Various models of standard commonwealth robots that (with the exception of Eyebots) stay close to where they are built.
* Merchants which provide a range of general and specialist products for sale.
* Special residents which have the appearance of significant characters in the game and that boost happiness ratings if built in settlements.
* Domesticated animals.

All activators are available at game start. Some residents of each type are available from game start with more unlocking as you progress through the main story, faction and side quests. (No new quests are added by this creation)

Q&A:

Where can I find the various components in the build menu?
The Residents Toolbox utilizes the existing workshop menu as follows:
* SPECIAL – Signature named NPCs
* DECORATIONS > FLOOR COVERINGS – Idle markers
* DEFENSE > GUARD POSTS – Guard Marker and Sentries
* POWER > MISC – Robots
* RESOURCE > MISC – Scavenger markers, Animals
* STORES – Store markers (under the relevant subcategories), NPCs appear under the “TRADER” category.
 
What animations are available for idle markers / scavenging markers?
* The available animations are: using a clipboard and pen, drinking coffee, digging through a wall, trying to break down a door, hammering (2 versions), warming hands, reading newspaper, painting wall, sweeping with broom, ushering (2 versions), sweeping with UV sweeper, welding (2 versions), woozy, using wrench (2 versions), kneeling, praying, prisoner, using screwdriver, doing pushups, and sitting on ground.

What NPCs are unlocked over the course of the game?
* Faction related NPCs (Minuteman, Brotherhood of Steel, Railroad, Institute as well as minor groups like Diamond City, Children of Atom, and the Atom Cats) are unlocked by various quest and game milestones. Major faction NPCs (Brotherhood, Railroad, Institute) are only buildable while you are affiliated with the faction but remain friendly regardless of later quest choices. Some other appearances (for instance power armor sentries using the HotRodder paints) are also unlocked during the course of the game.

What are the limitations on building NPCs?
* NPCs require various resources and sometimes perk skills to place. Human and Ghoul NPCs count towards the total number of settlers in a settlement, as well as food, water, and bed requirements but can be built in excess of the ordinary settler limit. Note that placing too many NPCs in a location may impact game performance so moderation is advised.

What robot types can be built?
* The available robot models are Eyebots, Protectrons (including police, fire, first aid, utility and chef models), Mr Handy / Mr Gutsy / Ms Nanny models, Assaultrons, and Sentrybots. Gen 1 and 2 Synths are also available to Institute affiliates.

Can robots be modified?
* No, the robots built by this creation are not able to be modified in any way. Users wanting to build modifiable robots should consider the Automatron DLC.

What determines Eyebot pathing?
* Eyebots are definitely free willed. They will develop a patrol pattern based mainly on exactly where they are placed however this can be hard to predict so it's best to follow one around for a while once you build them to ensure you are happy with where they are going. You can store and rebuild the eyebot in a different location in the workshop area to establish a different patrol pattern. Eyebots don't respect boundaries so they may leave the workshop boundary for part of the patrol route so caution should be exercised when building them in small settlements with close neighbors like Hangmans Alley.

I can’t allocate my newly built NPCs to any task. What am I doing wrong?
* NPCs placed by this creation perform tasks passively. They cannot be commanded in build mode to perform regular settler tasks nor can the be commanded to move to another location.

How can I change NPC appearance?
* NPC gear is not changeable via conversation. Many of the NPCs have a number of possible appearances, storing and rebuilding them will cycle through the available options at random.

How do I repair damaged power armor worn by a sentry?
* Simply store and replace the sentry to reset its equipment.

My residents are pathing strangely and/or disappearing at a non-settlement location. How do I fix this?
* While residents are generally compatible with player homes / encampments there may be specific locations that are not fully compatible with them. It is advisable to make a hard save prior to placing residents at any particular non-settlement location and then once residents are placed leave the area for 24 in-game hours and check to see if they are present on your return. If they have disappeared it is likely that the location is not compatible with resident NPCs.",1,1771009480.0,verifiedcreations,0,1.0,False

1r3xrsv,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0mq4siLE3A,Media Availability: Defender Aleksandar Vukovic 02.10.26,">Interviewer: Aleksandar, welcome into Phoenix. What was it about this club that made you want to sign here?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Uh, first of all, thank you. Thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to be here, especially playing in this league under weather like this. It’s a dream, you know.

>

>Uh, what made me come here was, I would say, the coaching staff mostly. We had a call and I think the mentality that the coaching staff has in me is very similar and their idea of playing is very similar. We just gelled very well and I knew after 30 minutes of the meeting that this is the place for me.

>

>Interviewer: You mentioned there obviously the coaching staff played a factor. After the first practice with the players, how did you connect with them?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: With the players or the staff?

>

>Interviewer: The players.

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Players. It’s a very easy group to get on with. We have a very interesting way of doing things. The pre-training is very, very chill. Everyone is dancing, listening to music, and then once we step on the pitch it’s completely different. It’s very competitive, and that’s what I like the most. You know, when we work, we work really hard, but when we are on the side, we have fun as well. So it’s a really good group, yeah.

>

>Interviewer: What’s been the biggest challenge so far, moving from the college game to playing with professionals?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Speed of the game, but speed of thinking as well, I would say. Not even how fast the guys move. It’s just more like thinking faster. Everything is way faster than it was in college. The intensity is higher. The guys are just on a different level.

>

>Interviewer: I mentioned there kind of everything’s a little bit different and the way the USL Championship games are played is also a little bit different. Have the coaching staff kind of shown you how tactically the game is in this league?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Yeah. Yeah. Predominantly I saw what teams do is go long and fight. But I think what we do here is a bit different. I think we put fear in opponents with the ball and without the ball as well. That’s why I like this place a lot because some teams, they prefer to go long and then fight for it, but we fight for the ball with the ball. So that’s something that really was really good.

>

>Interviewer: You spoke about making relationships with people on the team. Is there anyone here in particular that you’ve grown close to over this past month?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: We live in the same apartment building, so it’s kind of like a dorm vibe, like college type of thing. So everyone is there. I play FIFA with five guys a day, go to the pool. We go shopping together and everything. So I spend a lot of time with a lot of players.

>

>Who I talk to most is probably Luke Biasi and his girlfriend and my wife are very close right now. So we spend a lot of time together. I spend a lot of time with Rafa just learning from him every day. It’s crazy how much experience he has. It is unreal. And for me to be in the same position as him is like a blessing. I spend so much time with him just like a sponge. Whatever he says, whatever he does, I see it and I take a note. So those two the most, but everyone, honestly, yeah.

>

>Interviewer: You kind of mentioned earlier there how you’re one of the younger signings, played at the college level. Rafa played in the MLS. Luke, he’s got 100-plus appearances here within the USL Championship. Have you kind of soaked up their knowledge of the game and what they’ve taught you so far in your time here at Phoenix Rising?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Yeah, we went for a couple of coffees, actually three of us, and all I was just doing was asking questions. It was really good. They were just telling me to be patient. They say you have all the tools, you just have to work on it or learn every day and you’re going to make it far. So that’s my goal.

>

>Interviewer: You mentioned the weather here. Has anyone prepared you, talking to you about what the summer’s going to be like here?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Yeah, I’ve heard a lot, but I still can’t imagine it because Coachella was really hot and I was complaining and then they were telling me wait for the summer. So I have no idea what’s coming.

>

>Interviewer: Mentioning Coachella, when you look at the performances that you’ve put in so far this preseason, are you happy with the progression you’ve been making?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Yeah, progression is a big word. I would say from the first to the last game, it’s progression. The first one was good, the second one was a bit iffy. Third one was the best one so far. So I’m just going to keep going. And I’m learning every day. There are mistakes that I make and Pa is really good at telling you what you do wrong, where you do good. So I know next time what I have to do.

>

>Interviewer: Speaking of Pa, kind of his philosophies, the way he trains you guys, what he wants to bring onto the pitch. Obviously you spoke there how the coaching staff was such a big factor, but how have you seen yourself grow and buy into the system that Pa’s making here?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: I think Pa is somebody that I look at as like a father figure away from home. I’ve been away from home for six years now and this is the first coach that I actually feel like I can tell everything to. I feel very open next to him, very comfortable. So that’s something that I’ve never had before.

>

>And whatever he tells me, I trust him. It’s a relationship that I haven’t had before. He was a center back as well, so it’s very good for me. He has the same point of view that I have on the pitch and he’s been there. He knows. So everything he says, same as Rafa, I just write it down and try to do it tomorrow.

>

>Interviewer: How would you describe yourself as a player?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: I would say my best quality is defending. I’ve grown a lot through these past few years at college on the ball. I think right now I’m very comfortable on the ball, but very good in the air, aggressive, good defender.

>

>Reporter: Obviously you mentioned you’ve been over here for quite a few years now. Was the plan always to stay here in the US or did you think it was all about moving back home or somewhere else in Europe?

>

>Aleksandar Vukovic: Yeah, I always wanted to stay. Since the first year I realized this is a place where I want to be and after five years of playing in college, I’m really happy to be here. Yeah.",3,1771009041.0,PhoenixRisingFC,1,1.0,False

If you don’t want to default to an overpriced dinner reservation, here’s a tight shortlist of things actually worth leaving the house for:

❤️ **Sweetheart Festival — Downtown Loveland (Saturday)**  
Live music, weddings, heart art installations, downtown energy. If you’ve never done Valentine’s in Loveland, this is the year.

🎶 **LoversFest @ The Aggie (Saturday night)**  
Dance floor, DJs, not subtle, very fun.

🌲 **Winter Walk + Eagle Spotting**  
Bare cottonwoods = better bird watching right now. Fossil Creek, Lake Loveland, Lake Estes — solid winter magic if the sun’s out.

🍷 **Foothills Winter Farmers Market (Saturday morning)**  
Coffee + local makers + easy Valentine’s browsing without the dinner chaos.

(There are plenty of things for all the single folks out there, too!)

That’s just the short list.

Every Tuesday, I send a full Northern Colorado roundup (Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Greeley, Estes, Berthoud, Timnath, Johnstown, Severance, Fort Lupton, etc.) for free.

It’s basically for people who don’t want to scroll 20 different sites and would rather get one thoughtful mix of local history, trail ideas, small business gems, and the best things happening across the region.

1r3xoqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1r3xoqg/the_ghrelin_game/,The Ghrelin Game,"I have lost 50 pounds, but I have plateaued with the last 10 lbs. Well, today it's the last 7.8 lbs, but for the past three months I've been in the ""just 10 pounds left"" phase.

Here's what I know - it's not a willpower thing.  It's science. Ghrelin, known as the ""hunger hormone,"" increases significantly after diet-induced weight loss, promoting increased appetite and weight regain. Studies show plasma ghrelin levels rise to defend the body's previous weight, often remaining elevated and contributing to the high failure rates of long-term dieting. 

No matter how much I KNOW how to lose weight - no matter how much meal planning I do, how much stocking of the right foods in my cabinets I do... at the end of the day I feel like I *need* to go eat. I've tried drinking tea, I've tried having decaf coffee, I've tried brushing my teeth, I've tried going for a walk... I break down every single night.

And, having a social schedule is the worst. When I first started dieting I could say no, stick to a vodka and water and not snack. But, after two years, I'm over it. I want to eat like the rest of my friends when we're out. I want to go to cocktail bars and breweries with them. I've been doing this for TWO YEARS. I want to enjoy like they can.

I'm so damn close to my goal, but how do I push past all of this? How do I fight these hormones working against me? How do I get past being burnt out on it all?

I have changed SO MUCH about my diet. I bake my bread from scratch. Everything is whole grain. I eat a lot of veggies and fruit each day. I don't eat red meat - I don't eat meat at all. I have no ice cream in the freezers or snacks in the cabinet. EVERYTHING I eat is healthy - high protein, high fiber... hardly ANYTHING is processed. I have a nearly whole food diet. And alcohol? I didn't have any last month for dry January. I go solid weeks without a drop. Doctors would LOVE my diet.

But, at 9 pm I'm grabbing a bowl of walnuts and dried cranberries. Or I'm eating a piece of whole wheat toast. Or I'm eating a banana with some peanut butter. Or, all of these things!

I strength train twice a week for an hour each with a trainer. I get 10,000 steps a day. I walk home from work many nights (3.0+ miles). I'm doing everything right... but I CANNOT LOSE THESE LAST 10 POUNDS! And, I know it's because I'm eating at maintenance and not deficit... but my body won't stick to the deficit calories. Or my brain won't. Or something. I just break down every night!!

He said he wants to be friends first and that he’s the kind of guy that can’t get intimate without feelings… I was down for being friends first. Then he kept putting his hands on me. He kept asking if it’s alright and I said I wasn’t sure… he kept going. When he asked for a kiss I told him I wasn’t ready for that… but not long after he kissed me anyways. I did kiss him back. Later we were in an intimate situation and at that moment he drops that he’s not ready for anything exclusive (with his hands up my shirt). I play along because at that point my judgement isn’t fully functional. Then when I ask him about a condom and he says he doesn’t have one (but for some reason he has flavored lube?) I tell him no entry. He whines a bit and says he would “want to know what it’s like” at some point anyway. I tell him “you’re not the one who would have to deal with the consequences.” He drops it and we carry on for a while and then he suddenly goes “you know there’s the morning after pill!” To which I look him dead in the eyes and say “I’m not taking a fucking pill tomorrow because you wanna raw dog it. Go buy a condom or get creative.” he seemed to be in shock…. 

We did continue after that, but he ghosted me. This was after a pretty intense, emotional whirlwind connection… we met IRL and there was an incredibly strong spark. I feel a lot of shame for “giving in” but that may be conditioning…

I feel like me standing up for myself, and my bodily autonomy in those moments broke the spell of me existing purely for his pleasure and validation. In a way I think I was the manic, pixie dream girl at the coffee shop and he thought that I would come and fuck all his problems away.

And anyway, even though technically nothing “happened to me” since I did consent and participate and I set boundaries which were (reluctantly) honored, I still feel violated. I feel like I trusted somebody and I thought he saw me as a person, but in the end, he saw me as just a vessel for his own enjoyment. I feel like he manipulated and lied to me in order to make me feel safe enough to make those decisions… My physical well-being, emotional well-being needs, etc. were of no concern to this person who I trusted enough to unclothe around which is actually very rare for me.

1r3xjcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokenankles/comments/1r3xjcx/finally_found_my_holy_grail_shoes/,Finally found my holy grail shoes,"I had a trimal back in November 2024 and had struggled ever since to find comfortable supportive shoes that can put up with my lifestyle of standing up all day every day as a coffee roaster and barista. 

I had been in Air Max 90’s until I saw a podiatrist on Sep 25 who told me they were way too narrow and recommended I get a wide or extra wide fit stability shoe, 5mm drop minimum, with a mild rocker underfoot and to never not wear them - even in the house. 

I think I’ve bought (and mostly returned) almost every shoe on the market that meets that description. Some have been good - very good - and I settled on the Hoka Bondi SR to use at work with my orthotic that I now need. 

I have finally found my holy grail shoe now though in the extra wide Hoka Gaviota 6. It’s soft and dissipates impact as I walk, especially up and down stairs. It cradles my foot and stops it moving about so feels secure and stable. I don’t fear rolling the ankle. The toes are nice and wide so I can spread out. 

I’ve had some honourable mentions - Brooks Ghost Max 3 and Glycerin GTS 23 have been my favourites up to now, but this one is just perfect. 

I’m not sharing to say “all go out and buy Hoka” but because it’s been so difficult for me to feel comfortable and safe in my shoes again. I know some of you will recognise that too. 

If you’re new here - welcome and sorry. It gets better. As you recover prioritise seeing a podiatrist as well as your physio and invest in the right shoes. Don’t be scared to return them and try again, even if it takes 20 pairs before you find the one. 

I don’t mind sharing that I’ve had a little cry over these shoes because they’ve made such a difference to my confidence and comfort at home. ",5,1771008504.0,brokenankles,6,1.0,False

1r3xi73,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3xi73,Anyone else feel like these are kinda….cheap??,"I got this pin from Go Pin Pro’s recent Whatnot show where they released as a mystery pin. The price for each pin was $35 + taxes and shipping. 

First of all, this pin came in a black plastic ziplock type bag. No box. I thought that was a little weird because usually mystery pins come in a box where you can see the options on the front, back, or side of the box. I got 2 pins and both of them came without a box, just in the black bag. 

I was very happy that I pulled Megara because I collect Hercules pins, but I can’t help feeling disappointed in the pin itself. For a $35+ pin the quality is just unacceptable. It is borderline paper thin and extremelyyyy fragile. When looking at my Megara, I accidentally dropped her on my glass coffee table and nearly had a stroke because I thought she was 100% going to snap. Thankfully she was fine, but I just can’t get over how THIN these pins are!! 

I feel like an open edition $15 pin from PALM has significantly better quality. Idk I feel like they just totally missed the mark in these they are expensive and super cheaply made. For a business who’s absolutely boominggg right now, they need to do better. Please take notes, Go Pin Pro! ",9,1771008428.0,DisneyPinVents,23,1.0,False

All the dillydallying with Warren and myself set us back some. Took us a little while to get in motion again. Honestly, I would’ve preferred we were stationary longer because once I was back in the saddle, my shoulder felt like it was being ripped from my body. Mountains ain’t exactly a smooth ride. With the wind and the cold and rocky roads, I thought I might just die.



But once all was said and done, we got to Ironwood just as the sun was making its grand descent. As Annie predicted, there was a storm brewing. Dark clouds amassed in the east, heading west. Heavy winds. We were in store for snow and ice and a world of hurt.



I tell you, it’s a good thing we did reach town when we did ‘cause with our two new passengers, and Annie’s lack of a horse, we had to unload some of our supplies to keep from killing the mules. Which meant less food, clothes, and ammunition. If we were lucky, we’d pick it up on the way back. But I didn’t reckon us a lucky bunch.



We came up on Ironwood from the southern entrance. As Mendoza had said, it was a small cluster of houses, lodging, and shops. Built cheap, temporary living. Once those mines ran dry, companyman would come through and tear the whole place down. Set up shop somewhere else. Maybe sell off the land to someone stupid ‘nough to live there.



The entire town was clear. No snow. No icicles. No moisture whatsoever. Place was quiet. Empty. Not a soul in sight.



I think that silence weighed on us pretty quick because no one said a damn thing as we rode through. Not even the two highwaymen who had been complaining since we picked ‘em up.



We traveled straight through on the main road. From south to north. Didn’t see anyone else the whole time. At the town center, we did spot a couple of rabbits that hightailed it underneath a large tree. They burrowed quick, gone before we knew it.



Tree was big. All gnarled branches and dark wood. Roots weaved in and out of the dirt. Not a single leaf or drop of snow on it. Couldn’t tell what kind it was. Dogwood was my thinking.



From there, we continued north to the central hub. Where the church, school, and main lodging resided. Superintendent’s estate was about a mile east down the road. At the top of a hill. To the west of the lodging was a stablehouse.



We unloaded outside the lodge. Revolver in one hand, lantern in the other, I went up the steps and knocked on the door. No answer. It was unlocked, so I headed inside. Annie was right behind me with the double-shot Remington.



“Hello?” I called. It was strange to hear my own voice. Sounded frail. Afraid. Hollow. “This is Jackson Carters workin’ with the LesMoine sheriff’s department. If anyone’s here, make yourself known.”



Silence.



Dust hung in the air. A foul smell lingered. Something spoiled. Musty. I held the lantern out in front of me as I started through.



Like most lodges, it was built to maximize housing over comfort. About ten narrow rooms on the western half. The eastern half was for kitchen and dining. The backyard had a storage shed and a privy.



In the dining area, there were two bench tables side by side. Half-eaten meals on them, crawling with maggots.



“Rooms are empty,” Annie said.



I returned to the front door and whistled twice. Doc and Mendoza brought our prisoners inside. Annie and I retrieved whatever supplies were still on the wagon. Then, I unhooked the mules, took them and Abigail to the stables. All of the stalls were empty.



Since we didn’t have any snow nearby, I filled some buckets with water from our canteens. At least the stables had hay and grain aplenty.



Back at lodging, I found the others grouped together in the dining area. One of them had cleared the tables. Mendoza doled out some whiskey to the others.



“Doc, check his wounds and replace the bandages with clean ones,” I said. “Annie, why don’t you get a fire goin’ in that hearth over there?” I turned to Mendoza. “Wear your badge on the outside of your coat. We’re gonna take a walk ‘round town, see what we can’t find.



“Not gonna let me have a drink first?” he remarked.



“You drink on your time. We’ve got work to do.”



He groaned and rose from the bench to collect his coat.



I turned to our prisoners who were snickering like a couple o’ children. “Ms. Hirsch, you’re comin’ with us.”



She scoffed, indignant like. “No I ain’t.”



“Yes you are.”



“Why?”



My finger wavered between her and Warren. “Well, ‘cause I don’t like the two of you bein’ left together. Now, keep complainin’ and I’ll clout ya on the head.”



Mendoza retrieved the repeater. I checked the ropes around Evelyn’s wrists. Nice and tight. We exited from the lodge. Annie followed us out. “You’re leavin’ me behind?”



“I’m leavin’ you to guard Warren,” I said. That wasn’t gonna cut it. Not for her. “What you want me to say? Woman walkin’ ‘round with a shotgun. Think that’s gonna go over well with anyone?”



“Don’t worry, Miss Hoont,” Mendoza said, grinning. “I’ll keep a close eye on him.”



“That’s not what I’m worried about.” She retreated inside, slamming the door behind her.



Mendoza began laughing. “I think you gone and done it now. She ain’t just gonna let this go.”



We descended the steps and followed the main road again. Evelyn lumbered behind us. Kicking up dust, real sullen like.



“I ain’t all that concerned,” I told him.



Again, he laughed. “Well, you oughta be. You see, Cabrón, I have a wife—”



“Congratulations.”



“Right, thanks.” He snorted. “Anyways, few years ago, we had our tenth anniversary. I got her this tin thing or another. That’s what you’re ‘sposed to do for ten.”



“Uh-huh.”



“And I bring it home. She likes it, I think. But then, she looks at me funny. Says, ‘Where are the flowers?’ An’ I start laughin’ ‘cause back when we first got together, she tol’ me she don’t like flowers.”



“Yep.”



“I think maybe she’s havin’ an off day. So I remind her how she don’t like flowers. Right? Becomes this big thing. She hollerin’ at me, I’m hollerin’ at her, she starts cryin’. Now, once the dust settle, and it seemed everything was fine, I went an’ told myself the same thing as you: *I ain’t concerned.* But you know what I get every single year for our anniversary?”



“Flowers.”



“You’re damn right.”



That’s when Evelyn began laughing. Mendoza turned back at her, brow furrowed. “Whatchu think so funny?”



“You’re an idiot,” she said.



“An’ why’s that?”



“All women want flowers,” I told him. “Even the ones who say they don’t.”



“He’s right,” Evelyn agreed. “It’s not about likin’ ‘em or not, it’s the thought that counts.”



Mendoza muttered something in Castilian. A flurry of curses and grievances. “Yeah, well, least I got a wife. Lookin’ like you’re gonna be lonely a lil’ while longer.”



I sighed. “Whatever you say, compañero.” At the center of town, I turned onto an east street. “Why don’t you and the woman head west?”



“Sí, señor. You’re the boss, Cabrón…” He paused, frowning at me.



“Holler if you find anything.” I continued down the road, lit lantern hanging from my belt, metal squealing as it slapped against my leg.



The sun was all but gone then. Night came fast, draping the town in darkness. Clouds rushed in, bringing with them a frenzy of snow. It touched down gently, melting upon contact. Sucked into the dirt.



I stopped in the middle of the road and knelt to run my fingers over the ground. Soil was dry as bone. Hadn’t felt anything like that since I was down in southern Nevada.



Returning to my feet, I followed the road all the way to the edge of town. Not a single light. Not a single sound. Not a single human being in sight.



Gazing out at the darkness. At the empty void around me. It was beginning to dawn on me that maybe I shouldn’t have parted ways with Mendoza.



Hastily, I turned back and started the way I’d come. I passed by a string of shops including a general goods store, a tailor, a butcher, and a barber. To my right was the superintendent’s estate. A great plantation style house with tall pillars and a wraparound upper deck.



I slowed down. There was a hunched figure on the deck, silhouetted against the moonlight. Cupping my hand around my mouth, I was about to call out to it when the figure rose to its full height. Five feet, six feet, seven feet, son of a gun must’ve been eight to nine feet tall. Skinny as a rail with gangly limbs that were all bone.



My hand fell from my mouth to the grip of my revolver.



The figure tilted its head. Its right hand came up, waving back and forth. Over and over and over until I thought they were gonna wave their arm right out of the socket.



Then, the figure dropped out of sight, amassing with the shadows. I searched the field around the house, but to me, it was all just darkness. Taking my revolver from its holster, I continued toward the lodging house, quickening my pace.



Shadows loomed. The wind swept through, rattling leaves, howling through the alleyways. I broke out into a sprint, stealing glances over my shoulder at the road behind me. Snow and darkness. Dust kicked up by my boots.



There came the creaking of rotted wood.



I stopped dead, panting like a dog. Raised my revolver, finger found the trigger.



Annie stood on the top step, cigarette dangling from her lips, hand resting on her revolver grip. Carefully, I lowered my gun, and she relaxed. We both jumped at the sound of something screaming in the distance. Same sound we’d heard the night prior while at the clearing.



“Cabrón!” Mendoza called from down the way. I couldn’t see him through the night. Could barely hear him over the wind. “I’ve got tracks over here.”



“Wait for me,” Annie said. “I’ll grab the Remington and come with.”



I caught her by the wrist. “Hold up a minute.”



A moment passed.



Mendoza called out again. “Señor boss! Maybe a wolf. At the cantina. Bring me one of cigarrillos.”



“You gonna respond?” Annie asked.



I let her go. “Get inside. Make sure the rear door is locked. Windows too.”



Her eyebrows knitted together with consternation. “What the hell you talkin’ ‘bout, Jackson?”



I shoved her toward the door. “Inside, now! Bolt the doors. Get your Remington.”



“Don’t worry, Miss Hoont,” Mendoza said, leagues closer than before. “I think maybe he is havin’ an off night.”



Aiming my revolver, I called out, “Mendoza, you best strike a match. Show yourself.”



“Cabrón, over here!” It came from my left. I whipped around, searching the darkness for him. “Señor boss. Ten-minute walk to them tracks.” This time, it was to my right. I adjusted my aim and backed up the stairs. “Bring it home. I ain’t concerned.”



Once I was inside the lodge, there came the rapid patter of footsteps. Something on all fours. Racing toward me. Up the steps. Wooden boards groaning. I fired wildly into the night and slammed the door. Slid the bolt into place. Tied the handle with a length of rope just to be safe. Did the same with the back door



I went from window to window, peering outside, but couldn’t see nothing. Warren was in a fit, slinging questions around as if any o’ concerned him. Cracked him a few times, but it weren’t enough to keep him quiet. Annie patrolled with me, occasionally checking the doors and lodging rooms. Doc was oddly quiet, sat in the corner of the room, smoking from his pipe.



Seemed lost in his thoughts. Pupils were specks, darting around. Face covered in a thin layer of sweat. I left him alone. Better than getting him riled up like Warren.



It must’ve been fifteen minutes or so after I had returned when we heard the gunshots. They split the night like claps of thunder. Gradually getting closer and closer. Annie and I were poised at the front of the building, waiting for something to appear from the shadows.



Down the street, there was a flash of the muzzle.



Another flash.



And another.



And another.



Should’ve left a lantern outside ‘cause it was black as coal out there. We didn’t see no one, but we heard the footsteps. Heard the panting. Then came the banging against the door, hard enough to shake it in its frame.



“Carters!” Mendoza yelled. “Open this damn door right now, pendejo.”



Annie looked at me. I nodded. She backed away, double-barrel ready. I unhitched the rope and slid the bolt from the lock. With one hand, I opened the door. With the other, I aimed my revolver.



The barrel stared Mendoza directly in the face. He didn’t give a fig ‘bout it. Pushed my gun aside and rushed in. Whole time, Warren was screaming, “Keep that damn door closed, ya morons! Close it already!”



I turned to Mendoza. “Where’s Ms. Hirsch?”



Mendoza looked back at the door. “She was just behind me.”



“I’m here,” came Ms. Hirsch, running from the darkness and up the steps. “Don’t close it yet.”



“Close it,” Warren cried.



I reached out my left hand, shoulder burning like holy hell. She took hold of my hand, and then, she was gone. Yanked from my grasp so hard I went head over heels, spilling down the stairs in a tumble.



Muscles in my arm seized. Teeth clamped down to strangle a scream.



With Annie’s help, I found my feet quick and charged into the dark. I couldn’t see Evelyn, but it was easy enough to find her with all the screaming. Something was dragging her across the ground. I aimed high and fired, hoping my bullets would miss her.



In the flash of my muzzle, I saw it. Just for a moment. Tall bastard. All skin and bone. Dressed down to the buff. Crown of antlers on their head.



There was a sharp crack and twist. I fired again. Thing started screaming. Didn’t realize it’d let go of Ms. Hirsch ‘til I tripped over her.



Got to my feet and grabbed her by the hand. “C’mon now, I gotcha.”



Annie went to her other side. “Jackson?”



“Just help me get her to the cabin.”



We fell into retreat. Ms. Hirsch was whimpering and sobbing like a newborn babe. Tried to coax her, but I’ve never been very good at something like that. Instead, I pushed her forward, telling her to keep walking.



When we got back inside, Mendoza closed the door behind us, tying it off and working the bolt. We set Ms. Hirsch on one of the tables. It was then that I noticed the blood. Her entire right side was soaked through, and she was pale in the face, swaying like a drunk.



Her arm had been ripped off at the shoulder. Bits of stringy meat and bone poked out through the torn fabric of her coat.



“Doc, get your ass over here!”

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CHAPTER 4.**

“Get some water on the fire now,” Doc said as he peeled Ms. Hirsch's coat away from her body. She could barely keep her eyes open, much less resist him, despite the pain it wrought. “I need something to tie this off, please.”



I found a leather belt in one of the bags and passed it to him. Doc hesitated, eyes wide, brows pulled together. He snapped out of his stupor, offered a *thanks*, and wrapped the belt around what remained of Ms. Hirsch’s arm.



Doc injected her with some morphine and brushed aside her hair. “Just hold on in there, love. Everything’s going to be alright.” He turned to me and shook his head. I don’t know what that was supposed to mean ‘cause he kept at it, using threads of silk as tourniquets for veins and arteries.



“Can’t you just burn ‘em?” Mendoza asked. “Like they did in the war.”



“Cauterization might kill her,” Doc said. “You want to give her the best chances of surviving, you’ll let me do it my way.” He glanced up and smiled. “Now, how about that water?”



Mendoza filled a pail and hung it over the fire. Doc doused Ms. Hirsch’s stump with disinfectant. She went flying up from the table, screaming at the top of her lungs.



“Restrain her until the morphine sets in,” Doc said.



Annie and I each took a shoulder, forcing her against the table.



“Deputy,” I said, “cover the doors and windows.”



“Cover ‘em with what?”



“Guard them with your rifle, ya lunk! Make sure nothin’ tries to get in.” I turned to Warren. “You wanna help at all?”



“I’ve got a bum leg over here,” he said. “Whatchu wan’ from me?”



“I oughta kick you upside the head.”



“I need silence, please,” Doc said calmly.



Ms. Hirsch was starting to calm some. Either due to exhaustion or morphine. Didn’t matter much, as long as she wasn’t flinging about like a lunatic.



To Annie, I said, “I’ve got her. Grab your shotgun and watch the back.”



She stepped away, and I took hold of Ms. Hirsch by both shoulders. Doc removed his hat and coat. Rolling up the sleeves of his button-up, he began to whistle a gentle tune to himself.



“Old boy, I would greatly appreciate one of those cigarettes you roll oh so nicely.” He rinsed his hands with disinfectant, took up a scalpel, and began cutting.



It seemed Ms. Hirsch was completely out. Carefully, I backed away and rolled a cigarette for the doctor. He kept humming and whistling while slicing away pieces of muscle and meat. He would’ve made a damn fine butcher in another life.



“What’s with all the cuttin’, Doc?” I asked.



“Well, you see old boy, there’s not enough skin here yet. I have to trim the fat, clean the wound again, and stitch the bloody bits before I can seal it up. That’s even if she’ll survive that long.”



“You might as well just put a bullet in her,” Warren said from his chair in the corner of the room. “She ain’t gonna wanna live as a cripple. Won’t wanna feel that kinda pain. You’re better puttin’ a bullet through her skull.”



“Keep at it and I’ll start with you,” I said. Warren went silent, and I left the doctor to do his dirty business. Told him to call if he needed anything from us.



At the center of the room, I spun about, taking a gander at what we were dealing with. Two entrances, one at the front and another at the back. Several sizable windows on each wall. Only thing between us and the outside was a panel of glass.



There was plenty of furniture we could use for scrap wood.



“Mendoza.” I reloaded my revolver and went to the rear entrance. “C’mon.”



“C’mon?” He recoiled as if I’d struck him. “The hell you thinkin’?”



“I wanna get at that shed out there.”



“Alright, go on then. I ain’t stoppin’ ya.”



Annie shook her head. “I’ll go with you.”



“No, you’re stayin’. Keep watch.” I turned to Mendoza. “Deputy, I won’t tell you twice. MacReady gave me charge over this operation. You’re ‘sposed to follow my orders same you would with him.”



If I wasn’t careful, he’d retaliate. Maybe shoot me in the back. Didn’t have the patience to plead and beg though.



Annie opened the door, Mendoza and I ran out. Wind was fierce. Snow dragged across my face like the edge of a knife. I held the lantern in my left hand. Had a hard time keeping it up. Didn’t really matter; wasn’t giving off much light anyway.



We reached the shed. Door was secured with a thick padlock. Hammered it twice with the butt of my revolver. Nothing. So, I shot it off. Took two bullets. Mendoza was breathing heavy. Sweat licked the sides of his face.



“Hurry up!” he hissed.



“Keep your head. I’m goin’ as fast as I can.”



Inside, the shed was cluttered with spare tools and cobwebs. I hung the lantern on a hook as I searched for nails and hammers. Mendoza covered the door with his repeater. Poor man was shaking like a leaf. I might’ve been too if my shoulder weren’t causing such a fuss. Pain is a great distraction from fear.



My father taught me that. Unfortunately, fear is also a symptom of pain.



I found a box of iron nails and stored them in an empty burlap sack. Threw in a pair of hammers and a hatchet with a rusted head. Slung the sack over my shoulder. On the way out, I noticed a satchelbag with a few sticks of dynamite in it. Tossed that over my shoulder too.



As Mendoza and I headed out the door, there came a groan from above. On the shed’s rooftop was a gaunt figure standing straight as an arrow, arms out to either side in a T shape. Silhouetted against a sea of incandescent stars.



Mendoza opened fire. We sprinted for the lodge. I realized a little too late that I’d forgotten the lantern. We were left running in the dark. Mendoza’s rifle gave us bouts of light whenever he fired, but that was doing more trouble than good.



Annie opened the door as we mounted the steps. I was in first. Mendoza was maybe a foot behind me when he went down. Dragged out into the shadows, almost past the reach of the back deck, but he caught the railing at the last moment, holding on for dear life.



Annie blasted with her shotgun. Something went tumbling across the yard, squealing like a wounded hound. We grabbed Mendoza by either arm and lugged him inside.



Annie closed the door. Something slammed against it from the other side, trying to shove it open. I threw myself against it. Annie tied the rope around the handle. She struggled to get the bolt fastened. There came another bang from the other side. The bolt clicked into place. We retreated from the door, waiting.



Moments passed. Boards creaked from outside. Footsteps thudding against them. The footsteps receded. Silence ensued.



“Son of a bitch!” Mendoza pulled on his trouser leg. Three lacerations ran from calf to ankle. Blood pooled.



“Doc,” I called.



“Bit busy, old boy.”



“I can look at it,” Annie volunteered. “Doesn’t seem too serious.”



“Feels pretty damn serious,” Mendoza said.



While Annie treated Mendoza, I took the hatchet to the furniture and bedroom doors, cutting them into makeshift planks to board up the windows. By the time I was done, Doc had finished with Ms. Hirsch, and Mendoza was fast asleep, doped up on morphine.



After that, Annie, Doc, and I washed up and settled down for some supper. After having to unload most of our provisions, we only had leftover beans and saltpork. The lodging had some dried beef that hadn’t spoiled. A tin of coffee grounds too.



We ate in silence. Listening to the sound of crackling fire logs and munching teeth. When we were finished, we took turns keeping watch while everyone else slept. With Mendoza on the mend, the rotation was between Annie, Doc, and myself.



During my shift, Doc began sputtering some nonsense, saying things like, “No, daddy, don’t. It weren’t me, daddy, I swear it.” He was tossing and turning, kicking his legs as if trying to run. “No, no, no. Please, daddy.”



I shook him awake. When he came to, he reached for the revolver tucked under his pillow. Had the barrel against my chin, thumb on the hammer, before he came to his senses. “Oh, sorry about that, old boy.” He lowered the revolver. “Is it my turn already?”



“Not yet, Doc,” I said. “You’s was havin’ a bad dream, is all.”



He chuckled and shook his head. “Sorry about that. Hope I wasn’t making too much of a racket, was I?”



I patted him on the back. “No, you’re alright. Just try to get back to sleep.”



He laid down, and I went across the room to where Annie had her bedroll. She was up before I could even say anything. “My turn?”



“Seems so,” I said, stifling a yawn.



She climbed out from her bedroll and sat in the rocking chair by the window, shotgun over her lap. I settled on the ground beside her. Rolled a cigarette, passed it back and forth between the two of us.



“Any idea what’s goin’ on here?” she asked.



“Not a clue.”



“It ain’t no wolf or bear or anything of the like.”



“I know.”



“So, what the hell is it then?”



I handed her the cigarette and exhaled smoke. Didn’t have an answer for that. I’d been trying to think of something for the past how many hours, and I kept coming up with a whole lotta nothing.



“You saw what they did to Evelyn,” she said. “Some boards and nails ain’t gonna stop ‘em, Jack.”



“Slow ‘em down, maybe. Give us some time.”



“Time for what? They’re fast. Quiet. Only reason they ain’t charged in here yet is ‘cause they’re still tryin’ to figure out what we’re capable of. Once they do know, they won’t hesitate.”



That’s when we heard the mules cry. We leapt to our feet, trying to peer through the boarded windows, trying to get a view of the stables. The mules just kept screaming and screaming. Never heard anything like it. Then, Abigail was whining. I rushed for the door, but Annie threw herself at me, pinning me against the wall.



“You know better,” she whispered. “It’s a trick, Jack. They want you to go out there.”



The screams continued, louder and louder until they stopped. Then, there was only the howl of the wind.



Hooves clopped against the dirt and gravel. We turned toward the window. Abigail came into view, dragging one of her rear legs. Mane tussled, matted with blood. Internal organs trailing beneath her.



I brushed Annie off and retrieved the repeater, leveraging the barrel against a pair of boards. The iron sights followed Abigail, aligning with her head.



“Don’t,” Annie said.



My finger lingered on the trigger, muscles pulled taut. In the end, I lowered the rifle, leaning it against the wall.



Outside, Abigail collapsed with a grunt. She lifted her head and released a guttural groan.



Arms came from the darkness, wrapping around her neck. Claws sank into her flesh, tearing through it like a hot blade through butter. Blood poured from the wound, and Abigail went silent. The thing cut through maybe half of her neck, dug its claws in deep, and ripped her head off.



I turned away, teeth clenched, bile in my throat. Annie rubbed her hand in circles against my back, whispering in my ear. Couldn’t tell you what she said, but it was nice to hear her voice.



When I looked out the window again, Abigail’s body was gone. Only thing left was a trail of blood leading into the darkness.



“What’s the plan here, Jack?” Annie asked.



“These things don’t seem to like light, far as I can tell,” I said. “So, we wait ‘til morning, if we can make it that long, and when the sun’s up, we run for it.”



“On foot?”



“Unless you know where to find some horses.”



She scoffed. “We won’t make it. Not in this weather. Nights come fast and stay too long. We’ll either starve or freeze before we get back home.”



I mulled this over, fingers drumming against the windowsill. “How long, you reckon, ‘til MacReady sends others after us?”



“Who’s he got to send with all o’ us up ‘ere?” she said. “He’s only got two more deputies. One’s a greybeard. Other’s green as grass. All me brothers and sisters are off workin’. Pa ain’t got legs like he used to, won’t make the trip. So, tell me, who the hell would come for us?”



“When we don’t show with the Mason family, governor is sure to send others lookin’. Yeah?”



She agreed with a nod. “Maybe, but how long? A week? Maybe two? You think we can hold off ‘til then?”



No. I knew the answer was *no,* but that didn’t mean I had to admit it. Sometimes, when you’re in a position like that, it don’t matter about the odds or the facts. You just gotta have faith, and when it comes to faith, it’s about putting it in the right thing. Or rather, in the right people.



Something clattered from above. We raised our heads, following the sound of footsteps against the rooftop. They paused. There was a crash from the fireplace. One of the dead mules dropped on top of the fire, sending embers and ash through the air. The second mule came, and with it, the fire extinguished, suffocated beneath their bodies.



Silence.



Glass shattered. Boards snapped. Footsteps all around us. Growling and hissing. Gunfire erupted. Smoke filled the air. Screaming.

I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself, sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

**TL;DR:** Childfree, progressive, experimental and insatiably curious?

I know my story will not apply to many, but I'm sharing on the off-chance that I can help a few people. Also my spouse is AFAB.

  
**What Kicked This Whole Journey Off**

I got a UTI in 2024 after not having one for over 5 years. It didn't go away with my first round of antibiotics. It was persistent. This kicked off a string of chronic UTIs that seemingly came out of nowhere. I would go to urgent care, give a urine sample, and get antibiotics and be fine until the next one. After about 6 UTIs, my cultures started coming back as negative. My PCP was concerned and referred me to a urologist, specifically a *gynecological urologist*. 

**Initial Urology Appt**

Obviously there's a multitude of things that can cause bladder pain. She checked my pelvic floor (which is fine), and did several tests including ureaplasma (which came back normal). We talked in depth about the many triggers to see if anything applied to me. We finally got to the topic of genetic predispositions.

**Genetic Predisposition**

I have sisters -- so the suffering of another saved me a good amount of trouble. She had bladder pain for several years and figured out what worked for her through trial and error. Her assumption was that she damaged her urethral lining due to frequent UTIs. She found relief by:

* Taking D-mannose
* Elimination (mainly no coffee/caffeine, no spicy foods, no acidic food/drinks, no sour candy)

After months of doing that, she was able to start introducing those things back into her diet. 

So since my sister went through something similar, the urologists initial determination was that we have a genetic predisposition -- likely a shorter urethra. 

**Urology Appt Takeaways**

The treatment plan the urologist gave me:

1. Follow the same elimination diet as my sister
2. Try a couple of supplements (one at a time to see what works)
3. Start tracking everything I eat, drink, intercourse, and symptoms
4. Standing lab order to submit a urine sample anytime I have symptoms, then take AZO while waiting for results 

She was in no way dismissive of my issues. Honestly, she was a huge nerd about bladder issues, so very enthusiastic about helping me get better. There are other tests she could have done, but they're invasive so I opted out of them to see if the initial treatment plan worked.

**Supplements + Results**

* **Uqora 'defend' D-mannose:** Cleanse Biofilm for Daily Defense & Wellness
   * 😒 I tried this one first. It didn't help me.
* **Thorne Women's Daily Probiotic:** probiotics specific to your urinary and vaginal tracts (a regular probiotic does not cut it for bladder issues)
   * 😙 I think this one did help! Antibiotics ruin your microbiome so this one helped to build my defenses back up. I finished one bottle taking it daily, and have another on hand in case I ever have to take antibiotics.
* **Desert Harvest Aloe Vera SSAV capsules:** sooth urothelium/support GAG layer 
   * 🥰 This one is the real star. I took it as suggested, 3 capsules twice daily until you start improving, then you can start lowering the amount you take. I do not take this daily anymore, just before and after sex.

Things were going well, but I was still occasionally having pain. 

**2nd Urology Appt**

I looked back through months of my journal, and found that I would have pain for several days before my period. She explained this is due to hormonal fluctuations that happen before your period. The solution for this was **estradiol 0.1 MG/GM vaginal cream** (applied to urethral opening and like a knuckle deep into the vagina, on the front wall) during the 14 days before my period. It's a little messy, but it worked!

**One more thing that I think helped:** ***matcha?***

One of the main ingredients in Uqora is Green Tea Extract (EGCG), so I thought matcha would be a good replacement for my morning coffee. When I don't have matcha for a few days, my symptoms start coming back. So now I consider matcha as part of my long-term treatment plan.

  
**Where I'm at Today**

When I started introducing spicy/acidic foods back into my diet, I would take some aloe vera capsules with my food to ease symptoms. I'm just starting to be able to drink coffee/espresso drinks on occasion without pain. It's been about a year since I started the elimination diet.

I love raising my son on my own. We have a wonderful relationship. I love living without a man, I love my apartment, my bed, my peace and quiet. I love looking out the window on weekend mornings with a coffee in my hand while my son is still asleep.

But my parents, especially my mother, don't like that I'm single.

Recently, my mother told me, smiling, that she'd told my aunt I now have a boyfriend.

I was very surprised and said indignantly, ""But that's not true.""

And my mother grinned and said, ""It doesn't matter. She was SO happy!""

And from the smile on my mother's face, I could see that she was proud to have told my aunt that.

That's when I realized that my family is probably ashamed of me. As if I weren't functioning properly. As if I were broken. I'm apparently a blemish on the family. 

But this is the best life for me. And it should finally be normalized.

I love being single and I intend to stay that way. I won't conform to societal norms, but rather live the way that makes ME happiest.

I guide people to the steps of the dreams they envision for themselves.

A nice home.

A bright smile.

A firm handshake — that's all it takes.

I've guided 120 dreams so far. Some walk away fulfilled. Some walk away disappointed.

Every day, I make sure to look presentable.

Grab coffee from my favorite café.

Inspect homes with clients.

End the day with Mark at a modest hillside pub.

It’s been four years of this, since graduation. It’s all begun to blur.

But then —

There’s that dream again. Ancient. Too vivid.

A meadow, vast enough to outstretch the seas.

Clouds shifting like they have somewhere to be.

Winds rushing like business suits.

Trees standing proud.

Flowers in every hue.

Bees gossiping over petals.

Crickets and cicadas in argument.

Birds chirping like they're trying to mediate the fight.

Children laughing in the distance — small as ants.

An odd pair of shoes floats on a still lake: one worn, one new.

It’s serene.

She’s there.

We lie beneath a heavy willow.

Her head on my chest.

Hair like lilies.

Every so often, she glances back with deep brown eyes — checking I’m still there.

I smile to assure her.

And as the sun sets, we return to our small cottage.

When the dream hits, it bleeds into waking life.

I wake drenched in sweat. A knot in my stomach.

Like I’ve forgotten something important. Something vital.

And yet… I don’t know what.

I told Mark.

Tipsy, he smirked.

“Quite ironic, truly. That’s why I always say — better to be a bird and fly.”

“Flying won’t fix anything,” I said. “If I were a bird, I’d just worry about getting shot. Or starving.”

“Yeah… I think so too. But it could be fun, soaring.”

He swirled his third drink.

“Yeah… that could be sick.”

I agreed — silently. But I didn’t give him the satisfaction.

After a beat, I asked,

“How’s vacation planning going? Still with Lumine?”

“Yeah. Things are going… shockingly smooth. I don’t trust it. Feels like the universe is winding up to throw something awful at me.”

He lifted his glass above his head, grinning.

“Maybe a giant turtle drops from the sky. Ends it all. Just like Aeschylus.”

“Don’t be dramatic. Nothing that bizarre’s gonna happen.”

“You never know,” he muttered, head collapsing into folded arms.

That was enough.

I called him a cab.

Called it a night.

But I didn’t sleep. I lay in bed, haunted by fragments.

What could I be forgetting — yet still feel so deeply?

\*FOXGLOVE RIDGE WINERY\*  

\*Please read and follow these rules exactly. They protect you, the guests, and the cellar.\*

When I applied, the listing said: Overnight Cellar Attendant (Seasonal).  

It mentioned inventory, sanitation, “light security,” and a pay bump for harvest week.

It did \*not\* mention the rules.

The tasting room manager, Maris Reeve, slid a laminated sheet across the bar like a check you couldn’t refuse.

“Read it,” she said. “Then initial every line. If you skip, it notices.”

“It?” I tried to laugh. It came out thin.

Maris didn’t smile. Behind her, the last daylight bled through the big windows, turning the bottles on the wall into stained glass.

“The vineyard has weather,” she said. “The winery has memory. The cellar has appetite.”

She tapped the sheet once with a fingernail.

“And tonight,” she added, “you’re the only one here to keep it polite.”

The stagnant light faded as it fell on the final page.

\*\*1) No perfumes, no scented lotions, no gum.\*\*  

If you smell like fruit, it will assume you’re part of the vintage.

\*\*2) Lock the front doors at 9:00 PM. Leave the “OPEN” sign exactly as it is.\*\*  

Do not turn it off. Do not turn it on. If it changes by itself, do not acknowledge it.

\*\*3) If the bell above the tasting room door rings after 9:00 PM, do not look toward the entrance.\*\*  

Count to \*thirteen\* slowly. If the bell rings again before you finish, start over.  

If you reach thirteen and the bell rings once more, go to the sink and rinse both hands in cold water.

\*\*4) Don’t pour anything after midnight.\*\*  

Not wine, not water, not detergent. Liquids moving downhill wake up the wrong parts of the building.

\*\*5) The barrel room is not a shortcut.\*\*  

If you enter for work, you must exit the same door you used.  

If you forget and exit a different way, you will smell smoke for the rest of the night. Don’t follow it.

\*\*6) At 10:17 PM, you may hear a cork pop.\*\*  

Do not investigate. Do not call out.  

If you hear \*two\* corks pop, put on the ear protection by the crush pad and keep it on for exactly ten minutes.

\*\*7) If you see footprints on the concrete that look wet, do not step in them.\*\*  

Walk around.  

If the footprints begin to appear \*ahead\* of you, stop moving and say: “Inventory is up to date.”

\*\*8) The temperature in the cellar stays at 55°F.\*\*  

If the display reads 54°F, it is sulking. Work quietly.  

If it reads 56°F, it is excited. Do not go below the stairs until it calms.  

If it reads \*57°F\*, clock out and wait in your car with the doors locked until the display returns to 55°F.

\*\*9) If a guest knocks from inside the restroom after closing, do not unlock it.\*\*  

Slide a clean towel under the door instead.  

If the towel slides back \*folded\*, do not touch it again.

\*\*10) Do not read labels out loud in the cellar.\*\*  

It repeats names. Sometimes it improves them.

\*\*11) If you find a broken glass with no spill, leave it.\*\*  

Put a cone around it. Come back at sunrise.  

If the shards have moved, add another cone and don’t mention it.

\*\*12) At 2:00 AM, conduct a “headcount.”\*\*  

There should be:

\* You

\* The building

\* The wine If you count \*four\*, you have been joined by a \*taste\*. Don’t react. If you count \*five\*, you have been joined by a \*thirst\*. Do not run.

\*\*13) If the phone rings after 3:00 AM, let it ring exactly three times. Then answer.\*\*  

Say: “Foxglove Ridge, this is the night shift.”  

If the voice asks what year it is, tell it the current year.  

If the voice says, “No, the \*other\* year,” hang up gently and unplug the phone.

\*\*14) If you smell fermenting peaches, go to the nearest mirror.\*\*  

Check your teeth.  

If they are stained purple, you are fine.  

If they are stained red, rinse your mouth with water and spit it into the \*floor drain\*, not the sink.

\*\*15) Never go into the vineyard after dark.\*\*  

If you hear someone calling from the rows, do not answer.  

If they say your name twice, turn on the floodlights and keep your eyes on the gravel, not the vines.

\*\*16) If you break a rule, apologize to the cellar door.\*\*  

One apology is courtesy. Two is begging.  

Do not beg.

At the bottom, in the same clean font as the rest, it read:

\*\*IF YOU CANNOT FOLLOW THESE RULES, QUIT BEFORE MIDNIGHT.\*\*  

\*\*AFTER MIDNIGHT, IT COUNTS YOU AS PRODUCT.\*\*

There was a space for initials beside each rule. I initialed like my rent depended on it.

Because it did.

Maris watched until I finished.

“Any questions?” she asked.

“A couple,” I said carefully. “What’s with the headcount?”

Maris glanced toward the hallway that led to the cellar stairs. The air back there looked…cooler. Denser. Like the dark was refrigerated.

“It’s not a haunting,” she said. “It’s a process.”

“That’s…not reassuring.”

“It’s not supposed to be,” she replied, and then she reached under the bar and placed something in my hand.

A small brass tasting key on a chain.

“Keep this on you,” she said. “If you hear your name spoken from a barrel, you tap the key twice on the nearest bung. Not once. Not three. Twice.”

“And if I do everything right?”

Maris’s expression softened into something almost sympathetic.

“Then the winery ignores you,” she said. “Which is the best outcome we offer.”

The first hour was just work.

Mopped floors. Stacked empty cases. Checked the cooling unit. Logged barrel humidity.

At 10:17 PM, a cork popped somewhere deep inside the building.

It wasn’t loud. It was intimate. The sound of a secret coming unstuck.

Rule 6: do not investigate.

I didn’t move. I watched the wall clock above the tasting room door like it could protect me with its honest ticking.

A minute later: another cork pop.

Two.

I grabbed the big orange ear protectors from the hook by the crush pad and snapped them over my head. The world muffled instantly, like cotton stuffed in my skull.

And that’s when I noticed the other sound I hadn’t heard before the protectors:  

a faint, steady \*swallowing\* from below the cellar stairs.

I kept the protectors on for ten minutes exactly.

At the end of ten minutes, the swallowing stopped.

I took the protectors off and did not breathe too loudly.

At 11:40 PM, I found wet footprints on the concrete behind the bottling line.

No puddle. No drip trail. Just perfect footprints, as if someone had stepped out of a river and decided to walk in a straight line toward the cellar door.

Rule 7.

I walked around them.

Halfway around, a new footprint appeared—\*ahead of me\*—a glossy, wet imprint that formed like a bruise blooming.

My skin went cold.

I stopped moving.

“Inventory is up to date,” I said, out loud, to the empty room.

The air paused.

Then, as if disappointed, the footprints stopped appearing.

I backed away slowly, like you do around a skittish animal.

Behind me, the “OPEN” sign flickered.

Not off. Not on.

Just…confused.

I didn’t acknowledge it.

Midnight came like a lid closing.

I kept my hands dry. I did not pour water. I did not rinse a rag. I let sticky spots stay sticky. I let the discomfort build.

Better sticky than noticed.

At 12:22 AM, the cellar temperature display, which had been normally a smug, constant 55°F, ticked up.

56°F.

Rule 8: excited.

I stayed upstairs. I busied myself with paper logs. I made my handwriting neat enough to qualify as prayer.

Then it read:

57°F.

My heartbeat turned sharp.

Rule 8: clock out and wait in your car.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t second-guess. I grabbed my keys and walked out through the side door, not the front.

The air outside was autumn-clean, cool with leaf rot and distance.

I sat in my car. Locked the doors. Watched the winery’s dark windows stare back.

For three minutes, nothing happened.

Then the floodlights by the vineyard snapped on.

Row after row of vines lit up like ribs.

And in the middle of them—far too far from the building to be comforting—something stood between two rows.

Not a person. Not an animal.

A shape with the \*idea\* of shoulders, as if someone had tried to imitate a human using only shadow and trellis wire.

It didn’t move.

It didn’t have to.

My phone buzzed.

The winery phone number.

I didn’t answer.

It buzzed again.

And again.

Then it stopped.

In the silence, from somewhere in the vines, I heard my name.

Once.

“Michael.”

I stared at the gravel outside my car, exactly as Rule 15 demanded.

My name again.

Twice.

“Michael.”

My hands shook on the steering wheel. I didn’t look. I didn’t answer. I reached down and flicked the floodlight switch panel by the door. On, off, on, as if I could make brightness into a weapon.

The lights stayed on.

Something in the rows exhaled, slow and patient, like a wine thief tasting air.

Then the cellar temperature display in the tasting room window, visible faintly through the glass, clicked back down.

55°F.

The floodlights shut off.

The shape vanished with them, as if darkness had simply reclaimed its property.

I waited another ten minutes before I went back inside.

At 2:00 AM, I did the headcount.

Me.  

The building.  

The wine.

Three.

But as I stood there, holding the clipboard, I felt a fourth presence slide into the count the way a scent slides under a door.

Not a body.

A \*taste\*. Four.

Like the moment before swallowing, when you don’t know if you’re about to enjoy it or regret it.

Rule 12: don’t react.

I stared at the wall. I blinked slowly. I pretended not to notice the way my tongue tingled, as if someone had dripped a drop of something cold and expensive onto it.

A thought arrived in my head that wasn’t mine:

\*Pour.\*

Rule 4: don’t pour anything after midnight.

My throat tightened. My hand twitched toward the sink.

\*Pour,\* the thought insisted, sweeter now. \*Just a little. For us.\*

I found the brass tasting key in my pocket and wrapped my fingers around it so hard the metal bit.

I didn’t pour.

The taste in the air sharpened, becoming impatient.

Then, from below the cellar stairs, came a soft sound—like a bung being nudged.

Like a mouth testing its teeth.

My tongue tasted peaches.

Fermenting peaches.

Rule 14.

I walked to the nearest mirror behind the bar.

My face looked normal.

Then I opened my mouth.

My teeth were stained red.

Not purple.

Red, like fresh wine on white enamel.

My stomach rolled.

Rule 14: rinse, spit into the floor drain.

I used the water fountain—carefully, without “pouring” from a pitcher, because I didn’t know if it counted. I swished. The water tasted faintly like oak and pennies.

I spit into the floor drain by the mop sink.

The drain gurgled.

And the gurgle sounded like satisfaction.

At 3:07 AM, the phone rang.

Rule 13.

I let it ring three times.

Picked up on the fourth.

“Foxglove Ridge,” I said, voice steady by force. “This is the night shift.”

A pause.

Then a voice—calm, friendly, too close to the ear—asked:

“What year is it?”

I swallowed. “2026.”

Another pause.

A tiny smile crept into the voice.

“No,” it said. “The \*other\* year.”

My skin prickled. I hung up gently.

Unplugged the phone.

For a moment, the winery was quiet.

Then the intercom crackled.

Not breathing. Not pages.

Just a single soft sentence, read with the careful diction of a sommelier.

“Product,” it said.

And somewhere below the stairs, a cork popped.

Once.

I didn’t move.

Then another cork popped.

Twice.

I grabbed the tasting key and ran—not down into the cellar, not toward the sound, but to the cellar door at the top of the stairs, the heavy one with the iron latch and the faint smell of cold wood.

I pressed my forehead to it.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, because Rule 16 said apologize to the cellar door if you break a rule, and maybe answering the phone counted as breaking something I didn’t understand.

The door was cold as bone.

I tapped the key on the latch.

Twice.

A long moment passed.

Then, from the other side of the door, I heard the softest sound in the world:

A cork being put \*back in\*.

The building exhaled.

The “OPEN” sign steadied.

The temperature display stayed 55°F.

And my mouth stopped tasting peaches.

At 6:58 AM, the sky turned gray. Honest gray. Morning gray. The kind of color that doesn’t pretend.

Maris arrived at 7:02 AM with a coffee in one hand and her keys in the other.

Real.

She looked me over—my pale face, my damp hands, the way I held the tasting key like a rosary—and nodded once.

“You made it,” she said.

“I followed the rules,” I croaked.

Maris’s gaze flicked to the cellar door, then to the clipboard on the counter.

“Good,” she said. “Then it didn’t have to make you into anything.”

I stared at her. “How do you...how do you keep working here?”

Maris took a slow sip of coffee. Her eyes didn’t leave the cellar.

“You don’t,” she said softly.

“You \*ferment\*.”

Then she reached past me, flipped the tasting room lights on, and smiled brightly as the first day-tour bus rolled into the lot.

“Morning,” she said, like everything was normal. “Let’s open.”

Behind her, the “OPEN” sign lit itself. Perfectly. Obediently. As if it had always been waiting for someone new to wear a name tag. 

The memory of fermented peaches still danced along each bump on my tongue, seducing each nerve to convince my mind to work more. 

I lied. To both you and Reeve. I poured and tasted the delightful peach wine. It was the most raw experience. Sexual, almost. 

I need to taste the delightful, fermented peaches once more, to drown myself. To ferment alongside them.

Most resume advice is written by people who read about ATS. I actually worked with these systems - configured them, tested them, watched what they do to specific files. Saw where good candidates literally disappear from the pipeline.

It’s like watching a good movie get removed from a platform because of a technical error. Frustrating, and a little embarrassing when you realize you’re part of that machine.

Myth #1: ATS automatically rejects 75% of resumes

This is not true - and it’s harmful because it sends people in the wrong direction.

I personally talked to dozens of recruiters while working in this space. Almost all of them said the same thing: the system doesn’t auto-reject. ATS is basically a large database with filters. Not a robot bouncer. Although some systems I worked with were so broken, bouncer wasn’t even close - more like a bouncer who lost his own ID.

But here’s what actually happens: a poorly formatted resume doesn’t get rejected - it just sinks so low in the stack that no human ever reaches it. The difference is subtle but critical. You weren’t thrown out - you were just never seen. Kind of like sending a resume by fax in 2025.

Myth #2: Stuff it with keywords and you’ll get through

The most common misconception I saw - that ATS simply counts word matches. That’s exactly what creates keyword stuffing. And that’s exactly what now works against you.

Modern systems started recognizing unnatural language patterns. When I tested documents with obvious stuffing - they ranked worse than clean, well written texts with fewer keyword matches. One document I saw had the word Python in it 14 times. The guy clearly wasn’t applying to a reptile zoo, but the system still knocked him out.

What actually works: keywords in high-visibility zones carry more weight. The summary and job title are the first things the system reads. If there’s a match with the job posting there - you’re already in a different league.

What actually decides the outcome

Once the file passes parsing - the human stage begins. And this is where it gets harsher than most people expect.

The average recruiter manages 15-20 open positions simultaneously. Each one gets hundreds of resumes. They literally have no time to read. They scan. If you have a recruiter friend - buy them coffee. They’ve earned it.

Average time for a first glance - around 10-12 seconds. This isn’t a metaphor, it’s what physically happens. And most of that time the eyes travel down the left edge of the document - across the first few words of each line.

Practical takeaway: everything important needs to be at the start of the bullet. Not in the middle, not at the end. At the start. Yes, right where you usually put something like responsible for coordinating cross-functional stakeholder engagement within the framework of strategic initiatives.

Specific things I saw work in practice

First - job title. If the posting asks for Product Manager and you have Product Owner / Manager - that can already blur the match. Take the exact phrase from the JD and use it. Not a synonym, not a paraphrase - the exact phrase. The system won’t appreciate your creativity. It won’t appreciate anything actually, it has no feelings, I checked.

Second - certifications. Resumes with relevant certifications perform noticeably better. But only when formatted correctly: full name, year, organization. AWS cert is garbage for a parser. AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, 2023, Amazon Web Services is data. The difference is roughly like saying I know finance vs CFA, Level II, 2022.

Third - numbers. Resumes with specific metrics get interview invitations significantly more often. This isn’t advice - it’s a pattern I saw over and over again. Increased conversion and increased conversion from 2.1% to 3.8% in one quarter are two completely different documents in the eyes of both the system and the human behind it. If you don’t have numbers - make them up… no, kidding. Find them. They’re always there, you just never tracked them.

Fourth - timing. When a posting gets too many applications - it either gets closed or recruiters start prioritizing early applicants. The first 48 hours after a job goes live isn’t just a good idea. It genuinely affects your chances. Set up LinkedIn alerts and move fast. Yes, right now. Yes, even if you’re reading this at 11pm.

And yes - if you read this far, you already have more patience than half the recruiters I know.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",27,1771007448.0,careeradvice,2,0.92,False
1r3x2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumeWizard/comments/1r3x2d2/how_real_conversations_unlock_hidden_job/,How Real Conversations Unlock Hidden Job Opportunities,"I have seen it over and over in resume review meetings. The person with the perfect skills and a well-tailored CV gets quietly passed over, while someone with a less obvious fit lands an interview. I know it’s not always the case, however, I can’t deny it doesn't happen.

A surprising number of jobs just never make it to public job boards. I remember reviewing a stack of applications for a software role, only to find out later the team had already set their sights on someone who had worked with a friend of the hiring manager. That candidate still submitted a CV, but the real introduction happened over coffee.

It is not about having connections in some exclusive club. The folks who find these hidden openings are usually the ones who put themselves out there when they do not have to. Someone who reached out to a previous colleague for coffee, or dropped a thoughtful message to a hiring manager about a recent product launch. Not to ask for a job, but to genuinely talk shop.

When I think about the people who consistently ended up in final rounds, a lot of them had stories like this. They heard about a team expanding through a Slack group, or got a heads-up from someone they met at a meetup months ago. Sometimes it was as simple as responding to someone’s LinkedIn post with a smart question, which led to a chat, which led to an introduction.

A lot of candidates gloss over this because networking sounds awkward or inauthentic. I used to feel the same. But in practice, most hiring managers are just looking for someone who feels like a real person, not a faceless application. I have seen senior engineers and mid-career folks both land roles this way, often bypassing the black hole of online applications entirely.

One thing I have learned: you do not have to be the loudest or the most connected. You just have to be willing to have a few real conversations. The jobs you want are often hiding in those quiet corners, where people are talking about projects, not job postings.

If you are burned out by online applications and endless rejections, it is not just you. Behind the scenes, most teams make their decisions long before the posting even goes live. Small, genuine interactions often open doors that a perfect resume never will.

So if you are feeling stuck, maybe try shifting your focus from polishing the CV just a little more, to reaching out to someone whose work you actually find interesting. No need for a pitch. Just curiosity and a willingness to connect. That is where I have seen the hidden opportunities show up, again and again.",1,1771007446.0,ResumeWizard,0,1.0,False

It’s basically for people who don’t want to scroll 20 different sites and would rather get one thoughtful mix of local history, trail ideas, small business gems, and the best things happening across the region.

If that’s you, link’s in the comments.

Panera is perfect for this, but TWIST, the place needs to have gluten free food. Anyone know of somewhere that fits the bill? ",3,1771007428.0,Columbus,3,0.71,False

Afternoon 

Evening.  What ever the time I’d. When you read my post. Which will not get attention as I’m not a woman 

As my name says.  I survive on coffee and vapes 

I’m looking for a chat. A connection build a hold a conversation 

I’m a lover of curves. Wit and banter. 

I’d prefer if your in the uk. But I can get passed it if your not. lol 

Im  not gonna say the old I love cooking walk and read. I do enjoy all of those. But I also like to sit on my back side. Eat crisps while watching YouTube. 

If it interests you. 

Come say hello. And I don’t know. I’m trying to come up with an interesting question.  

What colour under wear do you prefer to wear. 

There you go. I should get some funny random responses I hope. 

we can get to know each other if you decide to reach out. 

See you in a bit. ",0,1771007388.0,UkFriends,0,0.5,False
