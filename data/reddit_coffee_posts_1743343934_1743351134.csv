""Janice Greene, a respected business leader, civil rights advocate, and longtime community member, has announced her candidacy for Mayor of Everett in the 2025 election.

Greene will challenge incumbent Mayor Cassie Franklin, and Scott Murphy, who announced his run on MyEverettNews one week ago.

Greene brings a wealth of experience from her 39-year career at Boeing, her role as President & CEO of the Women’s Business Enterprise Council (WEBC), Pacific Region, and her extensive work as a community advocate on various Boards, Committees, and leadership roles.

“I have spent decades advancing equity and opportunities for workers, women, and underserved communities– always with a sense of teamwork and understanding,” said Greene, who is making her first run for political office. “I believe that by setting an example and working hard, you can build trust and get more done than through posturing and finger-pointing. There is too much of that in today’s divisive politics, and I want to change that in our community.”

Greene, who holds a business PhD in strategy and program management, has built successful organizations throughout her years at Boeing, and WEBC Pacific. She began her Boeing career as a union line worker, a perspective that has informed her approach to leadership and connection with people throughout Everett.

“Our great city of Everett stands at a critical juncture. As I speak with residents from all walks of life and dive deep into the data, a clear picture emerges: Everett faces real challenges, but we also have incredible opportunities to build a brighter future for all, especially for our hardworking residents who form the backbone of our community.”


“I know what it means to have a union paycheck, a steady job, and opportunities to advance,” said Greene. “We need a mayor who respects working people and unions. collaborates with business owners for beneficial community economic outcomes, who advocates for affordable housing and family stability, and attracts the kinds of businesses and quality jobs to our city that give every resident a pathway to success– including small and diverse business owners who create a vibrant business community.”

In addition to focusing on jobs, housing, and affordability, Greene wants to make Everett a welcoming city for families with children, seniors, and new residents seeking opportunities to establish roots and build generational wealth.

“From community centered public safety to maintaining a wonderful system of parks, playfields and community centers, Everett can and must be a place where people are welcome, supported and safe,” said Greene. “I want to bring a spirit of inclusion and pride to the city and provide the best services to the people of our city, and let the region know that Everett is a city for all.”

While the election for Mayor isn’t until 2025, Greene felt driven to start early– not only to build support for her campaign, but to begin a listening process that she hopes will include Everett residents from all corners of the city and all walks of life.

“I want to allow needed time to listen to the people of Everett and shape policies that improve lives for all the people of our city,” said Greene. “I’ve learned over many years of business and organizational leadership– and raising my family– that change takes time and requires clear communication and genuine appreciation for the perspectives and experiences of others. Instead of a traditional campaign, I want to really listen and learn. I’ve lived in Everett most of my life, but there is always more to learn.”

Greene will formally kick off her campaign later this year but will commence this spring and summer on a series of community gatherings– in living rooms and coffee shops across the city. “I can’t wait to get started,” said Greene. “I’m excited for the future of Everett, and for the opportunity to bring new leadership, ideas, and a track record of success to this important role.”

“My friends, the challenges we face are significant, but so is our capacity for positive change. I have lived here almost all of my life and I know Everett is a city of resilience, innovation, and community spirit, and it is our working people who embody these qualities most of all,” said Dr.Greene. “By working together, by harnessing our collective strengths and creativity, we can overcome any obstacle and build a city that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.”

This is the vision that drives Dr. Greene’s campaign and her commitment to public service. A vision of an Everett where every child receives a quality education, where every adult can find a good-paying job, where every senior can age with dignity, and where every neighborhood is safe, vibrant, and thriving. A vision of an Everett where our working families are the top priority, and where no one is left behind.

“I invite you to join me in making this vision a reality. Let us seize the opportunities before us and face our challenges with courage, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to the hardworking people of Everett. Together, we can build a better Everett – an Everett of inclusion, innovation, and opportunity for all, especially for those who need it most,” said Dr. Greene.

Hello! I'm moving to Sarasota at the end of the Summer for a nearly year long apprenticeship, and I wanted to ask for some advice/suggestions! I'm not asking about places to live, the apprenticeship is providing housing which I'm SUPER thankful for, and I don't know exactly WHERE the housing is yet but I know I'll be primarily around the ""Rosemary District"" as Google Maps says. 

Here are my questions!

1. What are good recommendations for local coffee shops, restaurants, etc.
2. Where are good places to buy groceries on the cheap? (Other than the basics like Walmart/Dollar Tree)
3. Are there any local farmers markets in the area or within reasonable driving distance?
4. What are some fun small businesses nearby that are worth a stop? Like clothing, bookstores, antique shops, etc.
5. If you lived somewhere else before, and you moved to Sarasota, what's one thing you wish someone would have told you before you moved? (Anything NOT related to weather unless related to my last question, I know it's suuuper hot and humid. I've been looking at the forecasts nearly everyday and OOF. I know it'll definitely be an adjustment.) 
6. If you've lived in Sarasota your whole life, what's one thing you would tell someone moving here for the first time? (Again NOT related to weather unless you're answering my last question.)
7.  What are the safest parks to go to? (I'm a 22F so I want to be sure to be aware of places to avoid.)
8. What touristy places would you avoid? 
9. What touristy places are worth going to?
10. To those with curly/wavy hair, what is one thing you use to combat the humidity? I have combo curly and wavy hair and want to get it trained up before I come down! 

Thank you to anyone who responds! You don't have to answer all the questions obviously, and I'm grateful for any insight!  I'm super excited about the move, I have never been that far south before, I'm from WV and have mostly gone to the northeast and the furthest south I've ever been is Alabama.

On some occasions, I’ll hear one man in a group of friends say something within earshot without approaching me (in line getting coffee, at an event, etc.). However, it doesn’t go any further than that. If someone does approach me, I’m inviting and kind. But still it never goes anywhere. (Maybe this dudes are in relationships, and they only want to give a compliment?)

I just need to put out there that I LOVE black men. lol—they are all FYNE!

I grew up in Miami and that’s a place in the world where interracial dating is very normal. I would say in general, I would not mind dating someone outside of my race. But honestly, that’s never happened to me. I’ve dated only mixed race men and black men. I’m all about men being pursuers, so if a guy doesn’t show real any interest, I just keep it moving.

I should also mention that I am very tall. I am 6’2. But my height has never stopped a Latin man or a black man from approaching me.

I’m more curious about this now than ever because I live in a predominantly white city, and I would like to understand in general how white men in my age group view black women overall from a dating perspective. I’ve also been out of the dating scene for quite a while, and I’m ready to socialize and kind of get back out there.

Thanks for your input!

1jnfn2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Camus/comments/1jnfn2n/the_nonchalant_sigma/,The Nonchalant Sigma,"Below is a journal entry recounting an actual experience of mine. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the nonchalant sigma as portrayed in this true story. And I cannot stress enough that this is, indeed and truly, a true story.

**The Nonchalant Sigma’s Day at the Beach**

On a hot, decidedly nonchalant morning at a beach, some miles out of Algiers, the nonchalant sigma settled onto his usual bench by the shore. As always, he had come for one reason only: to enjoy his coffee with honey, and expected nor demanded anything else from the morning. Every sip, purposeful yet nonchalant, was a small rebellion against the world, a testament to a man who had made peace with the meaninglessness. The sun hung heavily in the sky, casting its harsh, oppressive light on the world. His eyes, deep with unspoken purpose, drifted across the shoreline—not looking for anything, just watching the world unfold before him.

It wasn’t long before a group of striking girls—the so-called *chalant hoes*, easily bothered and quick to flutter with interest—noticed him. Intrigued, their eyes grew lustful as they whispered to each other, each hoping that this mysterious sigma would give them even the tiniest sign that he was interested. Their allure was potent, but so was his indifference. 

As they approached him with bold advances, the sigma remained cool as a cucumber, his chakras unfazed. Their unsuccessful attempts to capture his attention annoyed them, and soon their playful curiosity turned into very chalant frustration. *“Why won’t you just talk to us?”* the chalant hoes complained in unison. The heat of their presence pressed in on him, but the sigma merely took another sip of his honeyed coffee, the steam curling into the morning air like an offering to the universe, as if to say that some pursuits were simply beneath him.

While many betas—and even some alpha males—might mistake this nonchalance for weakness (after all, their world revolves solely around fucking), the sigma was beyond such illusions. He knew that his indifference was not a weakness but the ultimate display of dominance. He did not judge those who chased pleasure—if that was their path, so be it. But it was not his. His nonchalance was not the absence of desire, but the mastery of it.

He could have had any of them—a glance, a smile, a whispered word would have opened countless doors. Yet, he chose not to. Because deep within him burned the realization that his purpose was far greater: a quest for meaning that transcended way beyond any physical desire. And as the chalant hoes raged scorchingly next to him, he remained entirely present in his own thoughts. He was actually thinking about what the wise turtle once said to the fat panda:

*""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present.""*

The words resonated with him, not just as wisdom, but as a way of being. What was there to chase? What was there to seek? Everything he could ever need was already here, in this moment, in his own thoughts, in the sweltering morning air. He was here to simply be, and the world could burn around him if it wished. And so, as the chalant hoes fumed, their frustration and fury searing through the air, the nonchalant sigma remained an island of cool and introspection. 

And even though the nonchalant sigma hadn't spoken a word, his unwavering nonchalantness spoke volumes: being nonchalantly himself was all that he was even remotely *chalant* about.

We are building for the guy in Brazil, the girl in India, the student in Ghana, the philosopher in a Dutch attic.
€4 is just enough to mean something but not enough to exclude.


3. It creates real value.

Free equals disposable.
€4 equals commitment.
People talk differently when they’ve chosen to be there even if it’s a small price.


And long-term?
We will keep this tier forever and build others above it if needed. But the base remains pure.

Bill lived in a world surrounded by the virtual. It wasn’t just that he *saw* the virtual—it pressed in from every angle, like a second skin over reality. Every street corner, every window, every patch of grass—it all shimmered with the thin, invisible thread of simulation. If you looked closely enough, you could sometimes catch the flicker, like static in an old analog TV, where the algorithm failed to mask its handiwork.

Advertisements glowed on the sides of buildings, but not in the old, static way. No, these ones danced. They laughed. They *spoke to you by name*. If you stood too long waiting for the bus, the sidewalk beneath you would become a scrolling feed of products you didn’t know you wanted yet. Trees might bloom in unnatural colors, petals gently drifting in a perfect, repeating loop. You couldn’t tell what was real unless you reached out and *touched* it—*felt* the texture beneath your fingers and confirmed that it was more than light and code.

That’s why Bill lived for the weekends.

Weekends were his salvation, carved out like an island in a sea of artificial perfection. He’d throw cookouts—real ones. No augmented grills, no virtual fireworks, no polished avatars. Just a dirty old Weber he’d had since college, an uneven patio with a few loose bricks, and the same faces he’d known since they were kids.

They weren’t perfect. That’s why he loved them.

Lindsey always arrived a little too early, half-expecting no one to show. She and her boyfriend fought too much and made up too loudly. James never stopped being a smartass, usually with a drink in hand and a grin that said he knew exactly how annoying he was. Donna kept everything light, with that dry humor of hers that could cut through any argument like a knife.

There were awkward silences and dumb jokes, spilled drinks, and arguments about sports. Sometimes people left angry. Sometimes they left too drunk. But the mess of it—the humanity of it—made Bill feel like he still existed.

Tonight had been one of the good ones.

Nobody got too drunk, which, honestly, might’ve been a first. Lindsey and her boyfriend patched things up before the night got too long. Donna told that stupid joke about the robot bartender for the fifth time, and everyone still laughed. James had leaned against the railing, giving Bill hell for overcooking the burgers, same as always.

When the last person finally left and James had closed the door behind them, Bill stood on the patio for a long moment, listening to the soft hum of the street beyond, the faint buzz of virtual noise trying to creep back in.

He sighed, smiled, and cleaned up the mess. Empty bottles, greasy plates, scattered napkins. Real things.

Then he went to bed.

The world blinked out the moment his eyes closed.

**Lines of Code**

When Bill woke, everything was back where it had been before. The streets outside shimmered faintly with overlays and interactive ads. His coffee machine chirped at him with a personalized message. The sunlight coming through the blinds was a touch too perfect, too symmetrical.

He brushed it off like he always did.

Because the truth of it was, he never saw the seams. Not really.

The ones who built this world had made sure of that. They knew how to lace reality into the code so tightly that the people living inside wouldn’t question it. They gave them bills to pay, jobs to hate, and friendships to love. They gave them *weekends*—small spaces where the messiness of life felt raw and real.

They even gave them memories, old photographs, scars that tingled when the weather changed. The human mind was easy to fool when the simulation was thorough enough.

But Bill wasn’t *real*.

Not in the way he thought.

The cookouts, the arguments, the laughter around the table—every bit of it was part of the simulation. He, Lindsey, James, Donna… they were all lines of code strung together to create something *believable*. Their flaws, their jokes, their drunken fights—they were curated imperfections designed to keep the system stable.

The ones who ran the simulation had learned long ago that perfection broke things.

People rejected worlds that were too smooth, too flawless. They needed cracks in the pavement, rust on the edges, friendships that frayed and patched back together. They needed moments like Bill’s weekends to anchor them, to make them believe this world was *the* world.

And so, every night, when Bill went to bed and his simulated consciousness faded, the world itself winked out. All the data, the avatars, the ads—they collapsed into code, waiting for the next cycle.

It didn’t *exist* when he wasn’t looking at it.

**Shutdown**

Three weeks later, something changed.

Bill was setting up for another cookout. The weather was perfect. Too perfect. The sky was an impossible shade of blue, the clouds spaced too evenly. The smell of freshly cut grass drifted in from somewhere, but he couldn’t quite place where.

Lindsey showed up early, like always. But she hesitated at the gate, her eyes unfocused for just a moment too long.

“You okay?” Bill asked.

She blinked, the hesitation gone. “Yeah. Sorry. Long day.”

James arrived next, cracking a beer before he even made it up the steps. Donna followed, laughing about something on her phone.

The night went smoothly. Maybe too smoothly. No drunken fights. No dumb arguments about football. Everyone laughed at the right times. Nobody got too drunk. The food came off the grill perfectly.

When the last of them left, Bill stood in the doorway, staring after them.

Something felt… *off*.

That night, he dreamed.

Not about the cookout, or Lindsey’s laugh, or James’ dumb jokes.

He dreamed about light—cold, sterile, endless corridors of light. He dreamed about numbers cascading down in waterfalls, about walls that shimmered when he touched them, about a sky that folded inward like a piece of paper.

He woke up sweating.

Bill looked out his window for the first time and saw the shimmer. Really *saw* it.

And when he stepped outside, the cracks in the pavement were *too* perfect, each one looping back into itself like a pattern. The smell of grass was the exact same as yesterday. The same man walked past his window at the same time, waving the same wave.

In the control room, a red light blinked softly.

“Subject 42 is destabilizing,” the technician said quietly.

The supervisor stood over his shoulder, scanning the screen. Bill’s data stream pulsed erratically.

“Run the reset,” the supervisor ordered.

The technician hesitated. “But… he’s so close.”

The supervisor shook his head. “That’s exactly why.”

A button was pressed.

Bill never knew.

When he woke the next morning, the sky was a perfect blue. Lindsey texted to say she and her boyfriend were coming by later. James sent a joke. Donna shared a meme.

The world shimmered, polished and pristine.

And everything was exactly as it should be.",1,1743350403.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

This was a video that was uploaded to TikTok by the original creator as a clip of a skit from YouTube. I believe the video reached the limit on TikTok, which was around 10 minutes in length. It was either that, or the video was so excruciatingly awkward that it felt that long.

The video opened with a man eagerly awaiting his roommate. I believe there was some kind of a joke he couldn't wait to tell him. The roommate comes home, and the man struggles to tell the joke in a funny manner. The man couldn't understand the punchline, so the roommate spent time trying to explain it but gave up.

I believe he then talks about hosting a party or complaining about how they never go to parties. The roommate invites the man to a get together, but the roommate declines, and I believe he said something about hosting one at their apartment. He then talks about how he's gonna go to the store and get supplies.

For most of the video, I think you see the man awkwardly driving around town, not really knowing where he wants to go, but eventually ends up at the store and what not.

This part I do remember clearly: he goes to a coffee shop where he attempts flirting with the barista. The camera is set up almost CCTV style but in HD quality. I think he tries telling the same joke he did to his roommate, and even she doesn't get it, but him explaining it seems to just throw her off. He then invites her to the party he is hosting, which she declines, but he asks for her number anyways. After being declined, he waits around at the counter before sticking his hand in the tip jar.

A few people around the shop notice this and yell at him, but he takes his hand out and acts like he wasn't doing anything. This is where the video ends.

Hopefully this isn't too niche to find, I do recall seeing it a couple of years ago but it's one of those videos that has stayed on my mind for a long time.",1,1743350394.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

Supermarket worker said rude things about my purchase (but she wasn't even looking my way). Men behind me said I left too small tip at the coffee shop (they were too far and couldn't see the amount), they said exact amount.   
It's weird that it happened three times at the week. I don't believe they were talking about me, probably about someone else. But now I wonder if I hallucinate. Didn't have hallucinations like this before, I hallucinate only at night sometimes. When I do, it makes it harder to fall asleep.   
Currently at abilify 5 mg, started this week. I was taking it before but quitted.

This is a follow-up to this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/bikepacking/s/cMXYOuJdFP

Day 1 – The Great Start (Or So I Thought)

Bismillah. The bags were packed, the bike was loaded, and at 6 AM, I set off from Mons, Belgium. My goal? To cycle to Amsterdam over the course of a week, covering over 400km.

Riding in the crisp morning air, I realized something: the sun does more than just warm you up. It boosts your mood, and after a chilly start, I was feeling great. That feeling lasted until I saw my first landmark of the trip—a fighter jet on a roundabout near a military airport. (I’m calling it an F-16, but don’t quote me.) It looked sick. Would've been even cooler if I was flying it instead of pedaling next to it.

The fun didn't last long

After grinding up a brutal climb, I thought, Hey, let’s go fast downhill.

Bad idea.

The descent was steep, and I was hitting speeds over 50km/h. My bags made braking harder, and the pavement? Slippery. I saw a sharp turn ahead and knew I wasn’t going to make it. Said my Shahada, braced myself, and boom—straight into the trees.

Crash report:

• Knee smashed.

• Chin split open.

• Dignity lost.

Some kind hikers found me (shoutout to them) and patched me up. Since I didn’t have a first aid kit (genius move, I know), they also directed me to the nearest hospital. After pushing my bike uphill because pedaling was pure agony, I finally made it.

The doctor took X-rays of my head, chest, and shoulder. Alhamdulillah, no fractures. Just stitches under my chin and a bandaged knee.

So, did I quit?

No way. We keep moving.

Nightfall came, and I had to find a place to camp. I technically wild-camped (which is illegal in many parts of Europe, oops), but I kept it stealthy. No fire, no cooking—just me, a baguette, some canned lentils, and raisins. Luxury dining.

Tomorrow, we move again.

Day 2 – Pain, Bruges, and Waffles

Morning check:

• Knee? Hurts.

• Chin? Feels weird.

• Morale? Still high.

After packing up my barely-standing tent, I hit the road again. Bruges was today’s main stop, and I had 70km ahead of me.

By mid-afternoon, I rolled into Bruges, a city straight out of a medieval fairytale. With its canals, historic buildings, and cobblestone streets, I felt like I had time-traveled. But I had a more pressing mission: food.

Finding halal food was a challenge, and I wasn’t about to drop a fortune on a restaurant. Supermarket run it was! A baguette, some veggies, rice, and a fizzy drink—budget meals for the win.

Lesson from yesterday? Find a camping spot BEFORE dark.

So I scouted an area, set up properly this time, and cooked. Finally, a warm meal.

Tomorrow? The Netherlands.

Day 3 – Getting back into Rythme

The day started at 6 AM pedalling in the direction of the sea, I had breakfast on the sand with some waffles I bought the day before and continued in the direction of the port.

I arrived at about 11 AM after pedaling more than 50km, and took the ferry to cross to the Netherlands. It was very windy and cold close to the sea. So I had to stop in a coffee shop and get a hot drink to warm up.

I arrived then to Middelburg, walked around the city, cosy place actually I really like the vibe there. Then continued cycling

At about 4 PM I had cycled about 90km, I arrived at a camping site, where I set up my tent, and went had a shower I craved for so long, also I put my devices to charge since I was almost out of battery in my 2 powerbanks. Made food, ate, and went to sleep.

Day 4 – The Grind Continues

The following morning wasnt very eventful, I grabbed my stuff and packed it on the bike. Then cycled endlessly till I reached Rotterdam, the route wasn't very entertaining, mostly flat, going through the fields of the Netherlands, passed a few villages too but nothing outstandingly interesting.

The best moment in my day was reaching Rotterdam, I felt a feeling of accomplishment, after a long day grinding those pedals, but reaching the city was kind of a mistake, because I couldn't find a campsite, the city was all buildings, so I had to do something sketchy, I decided to camp in a public garden between some lush trees, after spending more than 90min going around the city, I set up my tent in the dark using my muscle memory, ate inside the tent, and slept.

Day 5 – My favorite city in west Europe

Rotterdam doesn't get much love in Europe, but it is personally my second favorite in whole of Europe (only behind Barcelona, sorry lol).

I spent the morning going around the famous monuments of the city Erasmus Bridge, De Rotterdam, Cube Houses, Markthal..., to make it more interesting, I did not use google maps during this time, and relied on asking people for directions, which was very fun, I ended up meeting a moroccan guy (dhoutout Najib) who showed me around the city, he was on bike his bike, so was half of the cities population lol (seriously there is more bikers than drivers, would come as a shock for some Americans, knowing the city has half a million habitants).

After sightseeing, I took my way in the direction of Amsterdam passing by Delft, Den Hagg, and Leiden. This night I didn't camp, I went to a hostel for a warm shower, and to clean my clothes, as the following day was Friday (sacred day for muslims, where we do a group prayer, so I had to be well dressed)

Day 6 – Can't believe it ends here

The following morning, I rode my bike, and cycled the last 30km to reach my goal, the last home stretch, the sand dunes in the Dutch coastline, and the trails stretching as long as the eye sees, it was a great way to end an amazing trip, who had his fair share of drama.

Got to Amsterdam at about 11 AM, prayed, toured the cities gorgeous and romantic alleys, wanted to visit some museums but the tickets were all sold out, finally had a late lunch in Pizzeria, and went to the train station to head back home.



Now, was the trip perfect? Not at all.

But would I do it again? In a heartbeat.

I wouldn't change anything about this trip everything that happened was for a reason, and I am very gratuful for it, and very proud of myself for not giving up after the accident in the very first day, I would like to thank my childhood friend who conforted me after the accident and believed me, also he told me that this would make a great story. I will definitely be telling my grandkids about it, so I guess it was good story.

The Shameless Promotion

If you enjoyed this, I filmed the whole trip! Check out the full adventure on YouTube, the audio is in Moroccan darija, but I took the time to write the subtitles in English, French and Arabic, so if you have the patience to watch and read subtitles, definitely check it out : https://to.mysocial.io/s/l3jM2q-yz 📺

The following events were heavily traumatizing and it took a lot out of me to write it all out. However if anyone out there had a similar experience or knows what’s happening please reach out. I will pick up right where I left off. 

 Dad stepped forward, closing the distance to the center of the circle where Anthozoa lay.

“This creature thought she could hide here under our noses and poison the minds of our children,” he said, his voice dripping with mockery as he motioned toward the weak child lying before him.

“While her brother may have gotten away, let this be a warning to any other celestials who wish to be heroes,” he added, his words full of malice.

He grabbed my arm, pulling me towards the girl. She looked up at me weakly, her eyes filled with fear and pain.

Dad’s grip tightened, and he reached down and lifted her by the neck with one hand, holding her up for the crowd to see. I stood there, frozen in place, my heart aching at the sight of her suffering. However, I felt something new spark within me. At the same time, as I saw her hanging there, there was something else, something burning inside me- a yearning for her suffering.

“Look at how feeble she is!” Dad mocked, and the crowd erupted into laughter. The sound filled the room, and I felt small under the weight of it.

“This is the perfect opportunity to allow Elliot passage. To finally welcome him home,” Dad proclaimed, his voice echoing in the cold, dark space.

The crowd’s cheers grew louder, their voices full of excitement. He dropped her to the ground, and she landed with a sickening thud, her body weak and crumpled.

""My son,"" Dad said, motioning for me to come towards him. He took from his pocket and handed me a small dagger, its blade shining brightly even in the dim light of the lobby. It was gold and delicately engraved. My hands trembled as I grasped it.

“Anthozoa is the scientific name for coral,” he continued, his voice casual as he spoke to the crowd. ""An odd name, I know. But I think I know just what we’ll do with her.”

I looked at the blade, still feeling its weight in my hand. My fingers curled around the handle. The crowd parted as a few members stepped forward, their hands grabbing Anthozoa’s limp body and lifting her up in front of me, holding her upright, helpless.
“Stab her in the heart for me, Elliot!” Dad roared, his voice echoing through the chamber.

I stood there, unable to move. My hands shook violently, the dagger feeling like a foreign object in my grip.

The crowd began chanting in low, guttural tones, words I couldn’t understand. The air was filled with their anticipation, their hunger for blood and sacrifice.

I couldn’t breathe. The dagger felt heavier with each passing second. The girl was still in front of me, her eyes wide with fear. She was trembling, and I could see the tears streaming down her face. I was frozen in place. I couldn’t do it.

As the chants grew louder and the crowd pressed in closer, I felt something shift. A whisper in the back of my mind, a voice that wasn’t mine, urging me, pushing me, compelling me. It was as if the very air itself was calling me to act.

“I... must,” I whispered, my voice trembling as I looked into Anthozoa’s pain-filled eyes. “I’m so sorry,” I choked, shaking uncontrollably. I inhaled sharply, holding my breath, and with a trembling hand, I placed the tip of the blade against her chest.
She winced, her body arching back in pain as her eyes fluttered, looking away.

“Elliot, please,” she whispered in a raspy, broken voice.

I pressed the knife deeper, agonizingly slow, the metal sinking into her fragile skin. Tears streamed down my face, my body shaking violently. The chanting grew louder, more frantic, more demanding. I had to do it. I needed to do it.

“Elliot, please, remember,” she said, her voice rising, but still weak. Her face was now drenched in tears.

I closed my eyes, my hands aching from how tightly I gripped the blade, but I couldn’t stop.

“Remember, Elliot!” she screamed.
The force of her cry shattered something inside me. My eyes snapped open in panic as I stumbled back onto the floor, the world spinning.

In a blur, the cloaked figures swarmed, grabbing me and dragging me into the circle.
“Stop!” I screamed, my voice raw as I clawed at the air, trying to reach her. “Don’t hurt her!”

I let out a cry, but the crowd held me down, pinning me to the ground. The knife, discarded by her feet, was snatched up by Dad.

She squirmed in the arms of the cloaked figures, her body struggling against their grip, but she was helpless. The chanting grew more deafening, the crowd’s voices merging into a choir of rage.

I watched through the sea of bodies, thrashing to break free as Dad reeled his arm back and plunged the blade into her chest.
The sound of her scream pierced through the air, breaking the chanting. I could hear her agony as the knife dug deeper, but there was something else, light, blinding, spilling from the wound in a sudden explosion of brilliance.

Her scream died just as quickly as it had started, and her body went limp. Her body convulsed violently before going slack, her chest rising and falling in shallow, erratic spasms. Dad kept carving, each stroke of the knife brought another sickening crack, her bones twisting against themselves in ways that shouldn’t have been possible.

Her limbs buckled inward as if something inside her was pulling her into herself. The smooth curve of her arms shrank away, flesh bubbling like it was melting, reforming into stubby, malformed protrusions. Her fingers curled unnaturally, bending in jagged angles until they snapped backward and fused into her. Her legs convulsed, elongating for a moment before collapsing, the skin sloughing off in thick sheets, revealing muscle that twisted and tightened like writhing tendrils. Her mouth gaped in silent agony as her jaw unhinged with a grotesque pop, stretching too wide, the skin splitting at the corners. Her nose caved inward, collapsing into a sunken void as her skull pulsed and shifted beneath the surface of her flesh. A wet, crunching noise filled the air as her body continued to warp, her ribcage collapsing in on itself with a deep, visceral crunch. Her spine twisted violently disappearing into the grotesque mass that was now her torso. Her flesh darkened, the once-soft skin becoming hard and rough. 
With one final motion, Dad wrenched the knife free. What remained of her was no longer a body, no longer a person. All that remained was a grotesque, pulsating mound of flesh and bone. I watched in horror as the last of her body solidified.

The chanting stopped abruptly and in the arms of the cloaked figures, where once Anthozoa had been, was now a sickly flesh-colored coral reef. They placed the coral on the ground, and as she touched the floor, she began to melt, her once-solid form turning soft, shifting into a smoky vapor.

The crowd’s chanting began again, this time, the rhythm was different- softer, almost soothing. Dad pulled a flask from beneath his cloak, the same kind I’d seen beneath the vials. The vapor from the coral drifted through the air and slowly found its way into the flask. Soon, all that remained was the container in Dad’s hands, glowing faintly with the strange mist inside.

“It is finished,” he declared, his voice cold and final. As his eyes turned toward me I finally lost consciousness. The walls began to shift, the wooden log walls melted into metal, the ceiling stretched upwards and the people all around me vanished. I found myself on a ship, my ship.

I remembered.

The storm was like one I hadn’t seen in ages. I ran through the loading dock, a vast, cavernous space filled with people scrambling to stabilize what they could as the ship lurched and thrashed against the raging sea. Overhead lights flickered erratically, casting the scene in stuttering flashes of yellow and shadow. Crates slid across the floor, crashing into walls and toppling over as the vessel groaned under the weight of the storm.

Through the frantic movement, my eyes locked onto Clair, my youngest sister, perched atop a ladder, gripping it for dear life. Several crew members held the base, struggling to keep it steady as the ship pitched violently beneath them. I ran, my heart pounding, desperate to help. But it was too late. The ship tilted sharply. The ladder teetered. Clair fell. The paint can she had been using slipped from her grasp, tumbling beside her, its contents spiraling through the air in slow-motion streaks. People reached out, trying to catch her, trying to predict where she would land, but the same force that had thrown her had also knocked them off their feet.

I felt myself stumble, barely managing to stay upright, just in time to see her body hit the cold, hard floor. Her small, fragile frame crumpled upon impact, her neck twisting at an unnatural angle.

I didn’t need to check. I knew. I couldn’t stop. Couldn’t think. If I hesitated, more would die.

Scrambling to my feet, I ran past the others rushing to her side. Their voices were drowned beneath the creaking metal, the cries of the storm, the distant wail of something breaking. I had no time. I sprinted through the loading dock, past shifting crates and scattered equipment, toward the lift shaft.

I looked up. He was there, gripping the railing, surrounded by others as they climbed the spiraling metal staircase that wrapped around the broken lift. Sparks flickered from the machinery, the lights above casting the shaft in eerie pulses of gold and black.

“Wyatt!” I screamed, but my voice was stolen, torn from my throat like smoke in the wind.

I had to climb. The metal stairs rattled beneath my feet as I took them two at a time. “Wyatt!” I called again, my voice growing hoarse.

A deafening crack split the air. A cable snapped, the massive lift jolted downward, a sickening shudder rolling through the shaft as the remaining cables strained under its weight. People screamed, pressing against the wall, bracing for the inevitable. I pushed forward, shoving past frozen bodies. I was so close. Wyatt turned. He saw me. Just a few more steps- 

The ship lurched violently, the final cable gave way. I watched, helpless, as Wyatt was torn from the railing. He had turned because I called his name. If only I had stayed silent. If only he hadn’t looked. He fell, and the lift plummeted after him, the metal groaning like a dying beast as it chased him into the abyss.

It hit the bottom with a thunderous, ground-shaking slam. A final, resounding impact, like the last hammer stroke sealing a coffin shut.

I ran through the hallways. Up the stairs. If I could just reach Theron- if I could save at least one.

The top deck was chaos incarnate. The sky stretched impossibly vast, a swirling void of black and gray, the rain pouring in thick, suffocating sheets. The deck was slick, gleaming with water, waves crashing over the sides in violent bursts. The ship pitched and rocked, climbing and falling, twisting beneath the fury of the storm.

And through it all, I heard him screaming.

I ran toward the bow, my legs burning, the wind trying to rip me from the deck. Below, my voice had been whisked away, but up here- it did not exist. The storm devoured every sound before it could form. I dragged myself forward, the rain hitting my skin like needles, my fingers raw from gripping the icy metal railings. And then- I saw him. Theron!

He clung to the railing at the very front of the ship, his small fingers slipping against the rain-slicked metal, his voice piercing through the howling wind as he screamed.

“Theo! Hold on! Just a little longer!”

I was so close.

And then I saw the wave. A towering endless mountain of black, rising before us like a leviathan from the deep. The ship climbed its impossible height, trembling beneath the weight of its own insignificance. I latched onto the railing beside him, bracing myself as we rode the crest of the wave.

Then the ship fell. His fingers slipped. His body lifted from the deck. He hung there, weightless, suspended in the storm’s grasp before the wind carried his small body away.

I reached out, but he was already gone, swept into the abyss. I screamed his name, clinging to the railing for dear life. The ship slammed into the sea. The impact wrenched my grip free. My stomach lurched, and my breath caught in my throat as the deck disappeared beneath me. I fell,  the darkness rising to meet me. The cold swallowed me whole.

I awoke gasping and shuddering looking around terrified as reality hit me in the face. I sat seated at a booth in the diner. Everything around me flooded into my mind so fast. Seated with me were Claire, Wyatt, Theron, my real father, and my real mother. I looked around the table speechless.

They all looked back at me with quiet, expectant eyes. The diner around us hummed with an unnatural stillness, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzing faintly, casting a sickly glow over the checkered floors. The smell of stale coffee hung in the air. My hands gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white.

“Elliot?” My mother’s voice was soft, almost unsure.

I flinched. The sound of it was wrong. Not because it wasn’t hers, but because it was. It had been so long since I’d heard it.

I stared at her, at the warmth in her expression, the way her hands were folded neatly in front of her, the way her lips curled into the smallest, gentlest smile. She looked just like I remembered. 

My father sat beside her, staring at me with that same quiet patience. He was real. Not the hooded figure, not the man who had stood above me in that circle, who had handed me the knife. This was the father I had lost. The father who raised me.

I felt sick. My stomach twisted violently. I pressed my hands against it, trying to steady myself.

Wyatt leaned forward, his brow furrowed. “You okay?”

I couldn’t answer. I looked to Claire, to Theron. Their faces were blurred at the edges, shifting slightly like ripples in water.

“Where…” My voice cracked. “Where are we?”

Claire tilted her head, eyes glinting under the dim lights. “You don’t remember?”

I swallowed. I remembered everything.

The ship. The storm. The screaming. The metal twisting. The cold, endless water. The cloaked figures. The ritual. The knife in my hands.

“I-” I started, but the words caught in my throat. I turned my head, glancing around the diner. It was empty. The clock on the wall didn’t move. None of it felt real.

I turned back to them. My parents. My siblings. My mother reached across the table, taking my hand in hers. It was warm. Solid. Real.

“You found us,” she said softly.

Something inside me cracked. Tears welled in my eyes. My breath hitched. “But… how?” My voice was barely a whisper.

Wyatt glanced at Theron, who gave a small nod. Then, slowly, Wyatt reached into his pocket and pulled something out. He placed it on the table between us.

A single, small flask.

The liquid inside shimmered- pink, shifting like something alive. I felt my stomach drop. My skin went cold.

“You remember, don’t you?” Claire asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “What he did to her?”

The pink liquid gleamed under the fluorescent lights. My fingers twitched. My breath came in short gasps.

“We have to fix it,” Theron said.

I stared at the flask.

Then at them.

Then back at the flask.

The chanting echoed in my skull, the laughter, the snap of bones breaking.

I reached for the flask.

“Pour it, Elliot,” my father said, holding a vial of brown. “Fix what you've made wrong.”

I held the flask to the vial, tilting it to pour, but as I did so, I saw my mom’s face change. It flickered, behind her warm, dark complexion, I saw Mom, her wrinkled blonde-haired head, smiling, hungry.

“You’re not my mother!” I screamed, lunging across the table and tackling her to the ground. I swung my fists into her face, pounding them into her flesh. With each impact, her face flickered, revealing Mom beneath the guise of my real mother’s face.

The others jumped up from the table. My father reached for me, trying to grab me. I swung my small arms toward his face, clocking him in the nose with inhuman force. His face flickered too, Dad, hiding behind the guise. An uncontrolled rage took over me. I hurled my body weight at him, leaving my mother on the ground. Kicking my siblings off me, I grabbed onto the grown man, clawing and biting at his face and ears. His strong arms tried to tear me off, but I wouldn’t budge. With one final swing, I knocked my hand into my father’s face, and he froze, collapsing limply to the ground.

Then my father spoke, and this time, I could tell it was really him.

“You must remember, Elliot,” he said weakly, looking up at me, unable to move from where he lay.

Behind me, my mother got to her feet and cried out, “You little brat!” She grabbed a chair and hurled it at me. I quickly socked Wyatt in the face with as much force as I could muster, knocking him limp to the ground. As I did, his voice changed. He awoke, speaking softly.

“Save us, Elliot!” He cried, lifeless on the floor.

I turned to face my other two siblings. With tears in my eyes, I grabbed Claire’s head and slammed her small face into my knee with a gut-wrenching crunch. Her body flung lifeless to the ground.

“Save us!” She shouted from the floor. 

Theron and my mother came at me. I lunged past the woman’s arms taking Theron to the ground. I stood quickly and kicked him across the face, his head snapping to the side.

“SAVE US!” My siblings screamed in unison. 

I lunged at my mother once more, tackling her to the ground. I was on top of her, pounding my fists into her face over and over and over again. I grabbed plates from the table and smashed them into her skull. She was bleeding profusely, but she still wasn’t awake. She still wasn’t my mom. As she lay there sputtering, her arms flailing, trying to pull me off, I mindlessly dug my fingernails into her face.

I grabbed at her skin and tore my mother’s face right off her skull in a manner that was completely unnatural.

I held the mask of my mother’s skin in my hands, looking down to see her disgusting, bloody face beneath me motionless. Then, impossibly, the skin I held began to speak. Her mouth moved, twisting in my grasp.

“Son, you must remember… come back to us.”

I flinched, dropping the skin mask onto the floor. Tears streamed down my face.

My family lay there, limp like rag dolls.

“Remember, Elliot,” they spoke together. “Remember!” 

As I stood there, breathless, the door to the diner slammed open.

I swung around to see none other than Erinaceus standing in the doorway. His eyes were full of more life than I had ever seen in them before.

“They are not happy, Elliot!” he shouted, glancing back behind him. “Take this!”

He threw me a sledgehammer, I recognized it from the glass breaking room, its weight slamming into my palms. A crowbar and a fire axe were clutched in either of his hands.

“Follow me!” he shouted.

I hesitated, turning to look at my family.

“They aren’t real, Elliot.” His voice cut through the chaos. “Come this way if you’d like to see them again.”

For the first time, someone had said something I actually trusted.

I turned and ran, following Erinaceus into the room with all the vials.

“You have your vial, right?” he asked, looking back at me.

I had almost forgotten about the brown vial my father had given me. I still held it tightly in my hand.

“Yes,” I said, showing it to him.

“Keep that safe!” he shouted as he swung his weapons with inhuman force into the station holding the vials. The structure exploded into shards of glass and splintered wood.

“Get over here and help!” he yelled.

I shoved the vial into my pocket and swung the hammer into the station. The impact shattered everything. Fragments of glass and liquid went flying in all directions.

And then, I heard it. Shouting and footsteps came from every direction as the doors burst open and people poured into the room.

“That is quite enough!” the man shouted, the man who called himself dad. 

Everyone in the room froze. We were surrounded by cabin members, dressed in their ritualistic attire. 

Erinaceus stood beside me, breath heaving, his fingers clenched around the crowbar and axe. Glass crunched beneath my feet as I turned to face Dad. He stood at the center of the room, calm, composed, but furious, his hood slipped back slightly. 

“I have been patient with you, Elliot,” he said, voice low and steady. “I have given you so many chances.” His gaze flickered to Erinaceus. “And yet, you let him deceive you. You let him lead you astray.” 

“Lies!” Erinaceus shouted, stepping forward.

“Silence creature!” Dad lashed back, shaking his head. 

Then, with a simple snap of his fingers, the room shifted.

The floor warped beneath me, the walls stretched. The light from the overhead lamps twisted and coiled like living things, flickering, dimming. The broken glass and liquid from the vials on the floor began to move, reversing as if time itself had started to play backward. The shattered pieces lifted into the air, mending themselves, clicking into place, the vials refilling drop by drop.

“No…” I whispered, watching as all our destruction unraveled right before my eyes.
“Run Elliot!” Erinaceus shouted. 

And we did. We hurled ourselves forward through the crowd, an ocean of bodies scrambling to seize us. Erinaceus let out a cry he let out a blinding light that split the room, sending the crowd in close vicinity to us spiraling through the air in all directions.
We drove our legs forward, one desperate step after another, through the lobby and up the stairs. I followed Erinaceus, the horde of cloaked figures shouting and surging after us. As we ran, the house began to shift, the walls tightened and the lights flickered. The halls compressed in on themselves, growing smaller and smaller.

“We just have to make it to the door!” Erinaceus shouted, his voice barely audible over the deafening groan of the shifting walls. The hallway shrank with every passing second crushing the space around us into something barely big enough to stand in. As we continued down the upper hall the walls continued to grind and tighten. Soon they pressed into our bodies and I felt myself ache as I desperately tried to squeeze through. 

I looked behind me to see Erinaceus stuck just as I was. He looked at me, his young face carrying eons of wisdom behind his eyes.

“Look away, Elliot!”

I whipped my head to the side, unsure of what was coming. A sudden heat radiated through the air, followed by a blinding flash of light so intense that it burned against my back.

The walls recoiled, widening just enough, just for a moment.

I didn’t hesitate. I threw myself forward, sprinting down the narrowing corridor, reaching the door just in time. With one final, desperate motion, I dove through it.
I turned back… but there was nothing.
The hallway behind me had collapsed in on itself, vanishing into nothingness as the door slammed shut. I sat there, panting, my chest heaving, trying to gather myself.

Slowly, I got to my feet, my mind struggling to process everything that had just happened. The hallway stretched before me, lined with arcade machines, sitting there just as they had the first time I’d come in. Their screens flickered, displaying the same images.

I knew what I had to do. My fingers tightened around the sledgehammer still in my grasp after everything, it felt light, unnatural in my hands. I felt inhumanly strong for a thirteen-year-old. 

Without any more hesitation, I swung. The hammer crashed into the machine, sending shards of glass and metal flying. Instantly, the damage duplicated itself across every other mirrored machine in the hall. I didn’t stop. I swung again and again. Over and over, the heavy hammer slammed into the arcade machine until nothing remained but a heap of twisted, lifeless metal and wires. Not even a single dying spark flickered in the ruin.

My breath shuddered from my lungs. I turned and headed back to the door, wooden and out nof place in the darkness of the tunnel.

I stepped toward it, my hand trembling as I reached for the doorknob, uncertain of what waited on the other side.

I opened the door to see the hallway- red carpet, wooden walls, dimly lit like it always had been. I stood there motionless for a moment, looking around confused. Than I noticed something, small resting on the floor. I saw a hedgehog. It waddled and snuffled around by the base of the door.

I crouched down, staring at the tiny creature in confusion and bewilderment. It was red, slick, and fleshy like the coral Anthozoa had turned into. 

Then it spoke, causing me to flinch with fright. ""It's time to go back, Elliot. It's time you remember.""
It was Erinaceus' voice.

The hall around me began to disintegrate, unraveling like paper burning away in a fire, revealing a vast void of stars and space. Twisting galaxies and clouds of colorful stars stretched out before me

""Fall, Elliot,"" the hedgehog whispered, now hovering at eye level. ""Go home.""
I hesitated, “Don’t be afraid.” He spoke reassuringly. 

I leaned forward, letting myself tip over the edge and fall into the swirling astral sea.
I felt weightless, drifting down, down, down, the vastness stretching and spinning faster and faster around me.

""Goodbye, my child,"" Erinaceus' voice echoed.

""Goodbye,"" came the soft voice of Anthozoa. Everything faded to darkness.



I awoke, sputtering, gasping for breath, water pouring from my mouth.

The night sky loomed above me, cold and infinite. The chill of the night gripped my soaking body, making me shudder. The intense scent of the sea filled my nostrils, as I felt the slow rise and fall of a resting sea. I let out a ragged breath of relief.

As I lay there, trembling, I heard an exasperated, tearful sob. Then arms, warm, desperate, wrapped around me.

It was my mom. She clung to me, shaking, her body wracked with cries. ""I’d thought I lost you,"" she whispered, holding me as if she'd never let go.

I held her back, my own tears spilling over. ""I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so, so sorry.” I sobbed violently in her arms.

Then larger arms wrapped around us both, the scent of oil filling my nose. My father’s voice was rough, shaking. ""At least you're okay, son."" Then he too began to sob softly. 

As I cried in their embrace, I knew one thing for certain.

I remembered.

We met in New York City and have been living in Northern California pretty much all our adult life. Now it's time to make serious plans as far as where we want to retire. We have excellent retirement benefits (money + health) from working for the State of California for decades and are considering Kanazawa as a place to spend our final years in.

Although my wife was born in neighboring Toyama, she very rarely visited Kanazawa. She only remembers a school sporting event. We both visited the city once a few years ago (before the Shinkansen arrived) and fell in love with the place (although to be sure, it was from a tourist perspective). In searching for Kanazawa on the nets and YouTube, all I find are the incredibly repetitive and boring ""5 Things to Do in Kanazawa"" or ""10 Things to Do in Kanazawa"" or ""2 Days in Kanazawa""... sigh... I find nothing on the day-to-day life there. So, now I circle back to the title of this post...

What is daily life like in Kanazawa?

Just a quick run-down of who we are so you can get a feel for which neighborhood(s) might be right for us. My wife is a PhD clinical psychologist and I am a former university art instructor with a Masters in Painting. We will be looking to buy a house, not rent. Car?... not sure yet. Being in a part of town with good local family-owned coffee shops and cafes along the side-streets and back alleys is important. Neither of us drink, so bars and clubs are not important. I will most likely volunteer to give English language tours at any nearby art museums. We will also need room for in-laws (my wife's mother and sister) to come and stay with us for extended periods of time.

## Choosing the Right ‌Carafe:⁤ Thermal vs. Glass

One crucial consideration when selecting a Cuisinart 12-cup coffee maker ⁢is the ‍type of carafe. Cuisinart⁢ offers both thermal and glass carafes, each with its own advantages ‌and disadvantages:

*⁤   **thermal Carafe:** Thermal carafes are typically made of double-walled stainless steel ​and are designed to⁣ keep coffee hot ⁤for hours without the need for a warming plate. this helps prevent the coffee from becoming bitter or ⁣burnt. While generally more expensive up front, ⁣a‍ thermal carafe is a good fit for ‍those who plan to sip throughout the morning.
*   **Glass⁢ Carafe:** Glass carafes are more common and often less expensive ⁤than thermal carafes. They sit on ‌a warming plate to keep the coffee hot. However, the ⁤warming plate can sometimes cause ‌the coffee to become burnt​ or lose its flavor over time. Glass is a good choice regarding budget and⁤ if​ you are​ keen to have a visual ‍guide ⁤to ​how much coffee remains.

Ultimately, the choice between a thermal and glass carafe ⁢depends‌ on your personal preferences and how you plan to use your coffee maker. If you prefer to have hot coffee readily⁣ available for several hours, a ⁢thermal‍ carafe is the better option. If you don't mind brewing more frequently or⁢ don't need to keep coffee hot for extended periods,a glass ⁤carafe may suffice.

I really like my map, it has some wonderfully laid out islands. Not sure how I check which map seed I am on?

But there is this electricity conundrum. With electricity my industries and producing more on my main island but I think I am supposed to move industries to other islands to improve attractiveness and free up space. But that would make them less productive? Do I setup electricity on the production islands as well then? 

That would be too expensive I think, and not enough oil wells anyway. How do I think about this?",2,1743349856.0,anno,1,1.0,False

The air hummed with frequencies that made teeth ache and ears ring.

""BE NOT AFRAID,"" it thundered, its voice resonating through bone and soil alike.

The human—smartphone in one hand, coffee in the other, dark circles under bloodshot eyes—looked up. A single AirPod fell from their ear.

""Okay,"" they said flatly.

The angel's multitude of eyes blinked in asynchronous confusion. The burning wheels slowed their eternal rotation.

""REALLY?"" it asked, the resonant frequencies dropping an octave in bewilderment.

The human gestured vaguely with their coffee hand, some of the liquid sloshing over the side unnoticed. ""Dude, look around,"" they sighed. ""I got a lot going on and have you seen—"" 

They swept their arm in a wide arc, indicating everything: the pile of unpaid bills on the counter, the news alert flashing on their phone screen, the wilted plants they'd forgotten to water, the overflowing email inbox just visible on their laptop, the climate crisis, the political landscape, the economy, the state of healthcare, their student loans, their second job interview tomorrow, the pandemic they were still processing, the rent increase notice taped to their refrigerator.

""—all of this?""

The angel's wings shifted uncomfortably. It had expected screaming, prostration, perhaps even a religious awakening. Not... this.

""I mean,"" the human continued, taking a sip of coffee, ""you're incredibly terrifying, sure. Like, cosmic horror stuff. But I had three panic attacks this week already and it's only Tuesday. My cortisol levels physically can't go any higher. I'm all out of adrenaline, man.""

The angel hovered awkwardly, its divine message momentarily forgotten.

""Would... would you like me to fix something?"" it finally offered.

The human considered this for a moment, then pointed to the coffee maker. ""That thing's been making a weird noise. If you're offering.""",1,1743349792.0,UnabashedVoice,0,1.0,False

We are playful with each other , but it seems whenever I strike a nerve with him or something he pretends to choke / hit me. He just lightly wraps his hands around my neck , or brings his arms up like he’s going to smack me. This time he was getting ready to go tend to his dogs. I let him borrow my card last night because he needed cigarettes, and he lets me take his when needed so I thought it was fair. Before he left I asked for it back , and he got annoyed and said he wasn’t holding it hostage, I didn’t really say anything because well it’s my card why are you getting upset. Anyways I stood up because he was getting ready to walk out and he put his hands around my neck and pretended to choke me. I finally told him it’s not really funny to play around like that , and he replied by saying it is hilarious then started walking away,  then he flipped around and put his hands up like he was going to hit me. Then he went to dump his coffee in the sink. I was just standing there and he turned around again and went to grab my chin, after his playful actions I backed up not realizing he was trying to give me a kiss goodbye. That seemed to really tick him off and he said he’d see me later and walked out the door mumbling to himself. This is wrong right? This isn’t normal before is it??

A million different tastebuds =  a million different opinions. Plus each brand has it’s most liked flavour and taste - so it’s possible that one brand makes the best vanilla protein, but another makes the best unflavoured one.

The protein powder you’ll choose will first and foremost depend on what you’re gonna be using it for-  I will obviously not recommend the same protein powder for a sweet fruity smoothie as I will for a savory oatmeal breakfast. 

Now let’s get into which brands i’d recommend and what they’re best for:

1jnfbjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jnfbjx/my_sister_and_her_husband_are_letting_their_2/,My sister and her husband are letting their 2 year old drink their coffee and soda.,"So my older sister and her husband has their boy nearly 2 years ago, he’s actually 20 months old (not yet 2). And they don’t want him to have any tantrums or meltdowns so they always let him have and do what he wants. 

That includes coffee and soda. 

It’s not always, but he’s very interested in what us adults have, and he’s very insistent on having it. I don’t let him have anything of mine, but she and her husband let him sip Starbucks and McDonald’s sodas as much as he wants. Because they don’t want him to have a tantrum. 

I don’t know what to do to get them to understand they shouldn’t do it. They’re very defensive about any comment on the way they do things with him. But caffeine is extremely dangerous for a child his age. I just told her gently yesterday and she got defensive saying “it’s a long day, and it’s not a full coffee.” 

They’re very protective about everything else under the sun that could happen to him, but disregard one of the fundamentals to make their lives easier. 

I’m at a loss and want to see what others think is the best way to approach it with her. She especially is easily offended, will rant and rant both verbally and over text, and will throw back that I don’t have kids and “when you were a baby you-“ all day long. ",0,1743349646.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

So I met this woman on a Facebook support group. I initially reached out to her because she commented on one of my posts. I started talking to her about visiting this religious site to heal something really really traumatic I went through. Initially the topic was about the religious site, but then she asked about my trauma so I told her a vague snippet. She is around 40 and im in my early 20s.

Later on i made a post about my trauma on the page and she commented ‘OMG this is horrible’ and she sent me a screenshot of what I wrote and shes like ‘is this you?’. I told her yes and basically opened up more about my trauma and past events that happened in my life. Since I opened up to her, she would be calling me every morning before she went to work to talk about how I’m doing and giving me life and career advice. She thinks a role in marketing analytics would be good for me, and she keeps pushing me to do marketing stuff. She herself is a brand manager. But I lowkry dont want to work in marketing and I told her I want to do something like Finance but then shes like “I think you should stick to one thing” (its beecause i already have some prior marketing experience). But I’m really trying to get out that field. 

She tells me she relates to some of the stuff I went through and she says she wants to help me. One time she took me to the city for a lunch date, this is where I met her for the first time she was super nice and basically the purpose of the ‘date’ was to observe me and my body language/behavior and it was a nice date. However I left the house not telling my immigrant mom and she got really angry at me and kept calling me interrupting our ‘date’. At last I let my mom talk to her but she was still skeptical. 

I came home and my mom told me how she was upset with me for going out to meet this woman and told me to be skeptical of her intentions because “no onr is going to take you out on a fancy date for no reason”and  her suspicion was “what is she trying to get from you?” and “why is she behind you”. My mom was dissapproving of her because of her religious background (shes Muslim, but idt she is practicing). Eversince my mom said that I feel uncomfortable talking to her and sometimes get annoyed by her advice cuz it seems a bit dismissive. One time i spoke to her about this incident. Recently, I reached out to someone on Linkedin who hadn't replied a year ago. They didn't respond again, and when I told this woman, she said it was
""stupid"" to delete the connection, adding, ""people don't owe you anything."" That rubbed me the wrong way. Why should I keep connections that don't value me? Why not focus on building relationships with people who actually respect and prioritize me? Her advice felt like it was telling me to lower my standards (even though she tells me l'm not confident and I should be more confident) and tolerate people who don't appreciate my worth

One time I guess she was clearing out her closet and wanted to give away some of her stuff she doesnt wear or use and she kept insisting that she can drop it off at my house when I told her my parents are uncomfortable with it, at the end i convinced her to meet me at a coffee shop parking lot and got her stuff I was about to bring it home but then my mom saw and grilled me on who bought this stuff and she broke doen crying and threw a whole tantrum and she gave away the stuff to someone else the next day and her suspicions worsened like “whybis this woman behind you” I’ve asked like family friends too about this stuff they said its weird but my therapist thinks its not weird. I’m just so confused and have mixed feelings about her. 

I’m just not a big fan of her career guidance cuz i dont want to work in marketing. Like I know i have some marketing experience but i dont want to work in that field. And like maybe I think too highly of myself? idk? im stubborn? a little subconsciously cocky? or I just trust my mom’s words more than I trust hers. I don’t know if my feelings are valid or if I have a bias. I need legit advice on this ‘relationship’.  rewrite tgis post and say that I’ve had bad “friends” in the past who took advantage of me. While her messages do have strong truths in them sometimes i wonder if im being ungrateful. I mean I have really smart ppl in my family hut they’re not really willing to help. 

Sometimes i feel like I’m losing my ability to trust myself and find out whats right and wrong gor me and relying on her opinions/answers almost stripping me away from my autonomy. And I’m just getting more confused day by dsy and kind of getting dependent on her validation/repsones. Its like she always see’s other people’s perspectives but then kind of dismisses my feelings. for example: I posted something about an incident where I know I was wrong and I get a really straight forward and harsh response from someone pointing out how I’m “sooo wrong” I felt extremely violated/angry. I sent the screenshot to the woman amd she said she is “10000% correct” but for me her response didn’t sit right with me. My thought process was: I should probably not post my problems on social media as it is not the safest/nicest place for someone like me who is in a fragile state. And I know the answer to this problem and I don’t need a response from an irrelevant person idk. It’s disrespectful to me because a random stranger is violating my emotional boundaries and inter-personal relationships.The issue was looking for validation again also that one mistake doesn’t define me. 

The second time she gave me a And she tells me how I need to be “very empathetic with mothers” (like women who have babies) like why?? tf?? then she goes on long tangents about when she was with her ex husband and when she was in her 20s and thiught that her husband would love her. She tells me I need to be able to handle criticism. Like why do I need to “hamdle” criticism from irrelevant people?? I’m getying scared because I started speaking to her from march 2024 and its March 2025. But sometimes I get anxioous and need someone to talk to. But still i just don’t  know. She seems like she could be helpful but im confused and angry.

TLDR: I trauma dumped to a woman much older than me and now I feel like I overshared and she’s a bit too involved in my life. I don’t know how to drift away and don’t know if this relationship is appropriate. Anyone have any advice?",1,1743349561.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

about me -  i just moved to california in january of 2024 :) of filipino & spanish descent. aries (bday soon!). i have a bachelor’s degree in physical therapy from the philippines & am currently in the process of becoming a licensed PT in the US (i take my state boards this year 😭). enjoyer of the pop girlies - sabrina, chappell, NIKI, clairo, etc. in my spare time i like watching tv shows and reading. i like to hike but haven’t been able to do so in a bit (would love to do a trail with you 😊). i drink socially & also 🍃, but i don't do it too often. hugeee foodie, i cook but def like to tasting new things too. :) wandering in general is fun to me and so is getting coffee/matcha/milk tea, going to concerts, visiting museums. i love to travel & typically leave the country 1-2x a year. yapper when in the the mood, but i go from 100% to 0% fast. not a big fan of organized religion. twitter rat (sometimes, lol). loveee collecting trinkets and tchotchkes, my current faves are miffy, loopy and monchhichi. oh, and i have very left leaning views and would hope it’s the same for you. 😭

more about my personality - my love language is words of affirmation and acts of service. it takes me a while to get comfortable with people but i'm trying to overcome that :) INTP. i've been told i'm emotionally intelligent and can be pretty self-aware. i’m very loyal to the important people in my life. i'm an eldest daughter, so i can be hyper independent. it would be nice to find someone that will let me shut off my brain sometimes lol. though i’m an introvert by nature, i would say i’m pretty easy to get along with. i’m just good at enforcing my boundaries. and i stick to my principles. & most importantly i value honesty & openness.

you - i’m looking for someone i can first and foremost be myself around and vice versa. kind and caring. knows when take initiative. between the ages 21-30. being taller than me isn’t a requirement but i’d prefer it. knowing the difference between there, their and they're is also a plus :P if you’re a funny, a nerd or have dimples move to the front of the line pls T_T okay but for real, just be able to hold a conversation 🥹 i’m not responding to a ‘wyd’ 😭 somewhat open to ldr but it would be ideal if you were in the LA/SGV/OC area 🥹 and omg, i can’t believe this has to be said, but no misogynists, pls 😭

tbh, deep down, i’m just a lover who’s looking for someone to be a hater with her 😔

Turned out to be a ridiculous order from Starbucks that I went full judgmental on. Ridiculous requests she made on the food and her massive coffee/shake had around 25 pumps of different flavors and syrups. 

Whole trip took almost 45 mins and a lot of miles for just the $2 base pay. I was like the red dude from Inside Out. I said F this fat lazy B****. Right before I arrived I shook up the entire bag with her drink  and food inside to the point it was dripping out the side. Took a picture and left it at the door. It felt good knowing her order was ruined. 

Was I right for doing that? Of course not. As you can see by my rating not hard to just do the job lol. But I’m also a firm believer in tipping well for people who provide a service, always tip 20-25% when going out.

Our home currently has 10 active tanks and another half dozen DIY tanks to contain plants. I no longer feel that's it's a home. 

I was initially supportive of his hobby, but have feel taken advantage of a lot lately. I have no flat surface to eat a proper meal. Every thing is his work station, including kitchen table, coffee table, 2 desks. 

I have asked, pleaded for months for the tanks to be better managed. The situation has not improved significantly. Every month is another tank purchased at a great deal. It's been almost a year of living like this. I've been living in constant cluster with my needs not being heard. I do not need this cleaned at some time, I need it cleaned NOW. 

Every talk is met with defensiveness. I get yelled at when I'm asking for the mess to be cleaned. Husband doesn't understand my priority or concern. And eventually gets petty, ""Oh, good job! You did the dishes. "" He gets offended and angry when I'm frustrated by it. 

I really do not understand this man's logic... shall I follow you around with a rag to wipe all your mess with a smile?

I'm extremely hurt, and disappointed. After these fights, he still does nothing after sulking and mopping around the whole day. So in the end, I'm still cleaning, organizing and getting yelled at when things get moved.

Divorce is looking rather enticing...

1jnewpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1jnewpg/ssri_use/,SSRI use,"Hi everyone,

I am 18, female, bmi 17.6. I first read about Peat a year and a half ago and I soon started to implement his principles since they felt more intuitively ‘true’ than anything else I had read about nutrition. I am not a heroic peater so I haven’t made any drastic changes like mega-dosing aspirin or taking hormones, but I have cut out seed oils, supplemented Vit D & K2 over the winter, eat more fruit and dairy than I used to, coffee, carrot salad, etc. 

My reason for making these changes was to increase my energy and to make me ‘feel young’ again which I haven’t felt since I was 11/12.
For a few years I was a depressed NEET with no friends. I had just started to escape this state (went back to school and made some friends) but I was still so fatigued and self-loathing that I felt there must be something wrong with me physically and so I searched for changes to make to my diet.

But ever since I began ‘peating’ I honestly felt worse (not suggesting there is necessarily a correlation here). Not constantly depressed like I had been — there were some days where I had bags of energy — but I became extremely emotionally labile and sensitive. There were days where I would weep and self-harm all day until I cried myself to sleep. Then there were days where I became almost hypomanic and ecstatic and could get more done in one day than I usually would in a week. 

The beginning of this year was tumultuous. Every few days I would get the urge to run away from home and/or kill myself. I couldn’t point to anything physiological or environmental that might have been causing this — it seemed almost to come from above, like some divine force pulling me towards my fate. On the days where this feeling would abate I considered more and more that it would be best to take anti-depressants, which I had refused to take for years. I had read Peat’s article on the dangers of these drugs but I felt very strongly that nothing could be worse than the total despair I felt at that moment. So I saw my GP and was prescribed 50mg of Sertraline (Zoloft).

I started taking them 6 weeks ago and I really feel that there has been an improvement. I wasn’t expecting them to work at all. I am now much more emotionally stable and sociable. I no longer agonise about what I want to say before I say it. I am making plans for my future and working towards my goals at a steady pace. I feel more and more like I did as a young girl.

I’m aware that serotonin is bad in pretty much every respect. So how can I reconcile this fact with the marked improvement I’m seeing from increasing it? 

I want to know if anyone (especially any women since I think my moods were cyclic) has experienced this kind of emotional instability and if they found some other way of treating it than SSRIs. I don’t want to be on these drugs forever but I want to do some research before I come off them because I don’t want to return to feeling suicidal. I live in England so Wellbutrin is off the table and lithium is only available with a Bipolar diagnosis. Should I try any other vitamins? Thiamine maybe? Or some kind of speech therapy?

Thank you for reading all of this. Any kind of advice will be appreciated. I just don’t want to waste the rest of my youth and I want to be a better daughter and friend. ",3,1743348547.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

Some things that have been working for me in this direction:

- making sure to do something that I enjoy each day. Whether it’s watching a few minutes of a favorite show while I drink my coffee in the morning, having a phone conversation with a good friend, eating a favorite food or trying a new one…

- being present. It sounds simple, but it’s so easy for us to go into auto pilot and just go through the motions, especially when we’re busy. But seeing how we can be present throughout the day, especially when we’re with family or pets, can really add a lot of spark to your day.

- I started a 30 day “resistance challenge”. Resistance meaning that feeling of when we know we should do something and that it would benefit us, but for some reason we resist doing it. I choose something every day in that category and get myself to do it as part of the challenge.

Side note: very quick shipping and very nice packaging, I'm really excited to try more from them!!

Also, I have a really sensitive nose and am really picky about my scents. 

Hate: Smokiness, chemical smells, ""cologne"", strong scents. 

Neutral: Fruits, floral, mint

Love: Coffee, Pine, Moss? I want to smell like I've been living in the forest for years.

**Fanghorn II:** I know this is? a fan favorite? or one of the scents that is a must try. It seemed nice but the mint reminded me too much of Vaporub to want to spray it on myself every day. Because of that, I felt it was too medicinal for me.

**Oxylus:** Once I sprayed it on it smelled green-like, like I just sprayed carrot on me (not necessarily a bad thing). Once it dried out, I can only describe the smell as the description of ""fresh"". Like I was inhaling a river stream. This was my favorite of the three. I could still tell there was some kind of smokiness, though, and would love if I could find something that just didn't have that.

**Boreal:** Smells like you walked straight into a wood cabin. There was a minty scent that gave that freshness, and I liked it quite a bit, but something reminded me of medicine/mosquito repellant (maybe it was my times camping). Either way definitely a nice scent, but not for me.

I would definitely love to try more Pineward! Did I choose the right ones to start with? I am also considering getting Sawmill.

Let’s talk about something radical—but also really simple: **taking yourself on a beautiful date**. Yes, just you.

Today, I went to the cinema by myself. Afterwards, I treated myself to a gorgeous slice of Persian cake and a cup of Persian saffron black tea. I sat there soaking in the atmosphere, not waiting for anyone, not trying to impress anyone—just enjoying the moment. And it hit me: I used to always wait for a guy to invite me to this coffee place. But then I thought, *why am I waiting?* What if that invitation never comes? Why would I deny myself a beautiful experience just because I’m single?

That was a game-changer.

When you're single—trans or not—it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that romance, luxury, or special experiences are only valid if someone else brings them into your life. But the truth is, we can—and should—be our own lovers first.  
**You deserve the cake. You deserve the cinema night. You deserve to be seen, cherished, and celebrated—even if it's just by you.**

Building a good relationship with yourself is the most foundational kind of intimacy. If you're dating out of loneliness, trying to fill a void, it often leads to pain, confusion, or settling for less than you deserve. But if you're dating because you're full of life, full of love for yourself, and excited to *share* your world with someone—that’s when real connection begins.

So go out. Dress up for you. Buy yourself flowers. Book that solo dinner at the cute restaurant you've always wanted to try. Laugh at the movie alone. Take selfies like you're on a date—because you are. **With yourself.**

Because if you’re comfortable in your own company, you’re not waiting—you’re living.

And trust me, the right people are drawn to someone who truly enjoys their own presence.

---

So yeah... it’s just so wonderful to sit in a café, admire the beauty of other women, watch people walk by, soak it all in—and feel totally good being there by yourself.  
If you're happy within yourself, everything else is just a bonus.  
**It really starts with you.**

Love you all,  
Big kisses,

I hesitate a little, because: on the one hand I already have a dripper (Origami) with that kind of style on the bottom. Why not keep varieties in between my gear? On the other hand: the main complain about the Stagg X is low flowrate or clogging. And I do not use it that often anyway.

1. Most used: Origami (with Kalita 185)
2. Most used variant: Pulsar
3. at Work: Mugen (leftover from a broken Switch mod.)
4. for my GFs ""flat white"", 8min brews & cold brew in the summer: Aeropress
5. less often used: Stagg X with mesh; Variant: Negotiator
6. mostly decoration: Chemex
7. in closet: V60 ceramic

So does anybody have experience, or read about that and would say it's a gamechanger? Or should I stick with more variants in my gear? F.e. for very light coffee beans were the water rushes through?

1jneq05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jneq05/staining_on_card_hp_or_damaged/,Staining on card - HP or Damaged?,"I recently found about 800 vintage Pokémon cards from base set through B&W, nothing too crazy, but still some solid stuff . . . maybe 50 or so of them have some sort of staining on the back, looks kind of like a coffee stain but I'm not 100% sure what stained it.

Other than the staining on the back of the card, these 50 are in great shape and I would normally categorize some as LP and most as MP due to normal edge wear, scuffs, etc. 

But with the staining on the back I'm not sure if I should downgrade to HP or Damaged. No creases / tears, and the staining didn't ""bubble"" up the back of the card, but it looks really bad. 

If the staining was on the front of the card, I would certainly count it as damaged, back has be debating. 

Attached picture for one example - based on the general wear on this Kabutops, I would usually say it is moderately played . . .maybe verging on heavily played. But with the staining, not sure if I should go to HP or DMG.

They sent a small batch of beans to a local coffee shop here in Chicago. Snatched up 3 bags. This one, a Geisha from Veracruz, and Garnica/Marsellesa all from Mexican producers.

Brewed up a big batch of this in the Kalita 185 using the George Howell method and it came out great so far. Got notes of raspberry, hibiscus and some slight pomegranate. Beans are about 4 weeks from roast date.

If you can get your hands on these, they’re definitely worth a try. It looks like they also offer shipping to the US now as well.",2,1743348033.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False
1jnepu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jeffthekiller/comments/1jnepu5/creepypasta_jeff_the_killer_part_one/,Creepypasta Jeff The Killer Part One,"Hey people, maybe you don't care, but I think Jeff the Killer deserves a better narrative, I will be posting the new Jeff the Killer version, I hope you like it, although due to its length, I will divide it into three parts, enjoy and leave your reviews:

CREEPYPASTAS: JEFF THE KILLER

Night, deep into the night…
The wind howled through this new house. A new future? Maybe. But the echo of the taunts, the thudding of fists against Jeff’s flesh… those weren’t so easy to forget.
The house was typical, dull—almost like everything else in his life. Not too big, not too small. Just… average.

“Mom, where am I going to sleep?”
“Shut up, Liu… Mom’s not in the mood for your games right now.”
“Jeff! Could you help me bring some things down?”
“Yeah! I’m coming…”

Walk to the car, grab boxes, repeat. Some had glasses, others Liu’s toys, and others…

“Why do I have to carry Liu’s toys too?!”
“Come on, Jeff! Can’t you do your little brother this one favor?”
“Fine, whatever…”

More and more of Liu’s toys. Some were dinosaurs, others teddy bears…
Jeff climbed the stairs, swaying from side to side, his vision half-blocked by the box he was carrying…
Until he reached what was supposed to be Liu’s new room—spacious, yellow with red spheres, a fan with a warm light, oddly perfect in its own way.

“Why did Liu get this room? Tsk… He’s always the favorite. Sometimes I wish—“

A small, fast, excited shadow darted up the stairs.

“Jeff! You didn’t mess up my toys, did you?!”
“No. Not that they’re anything special…”
“Ohh! Did you see how big my room is?! It’s so nice!”
“Are you really surprised? You always get the best of everything… and me? What do I get?!”
“Jeff, well… um… You got that white hoodie! Isn’t it nice? Huh?!”
“Yeah, yeah… real nice. Wait! What’s that?!”
“What?!
“My finger! Hahaha!”
“That’s not funny… but… Hey! You’re smiling! That’s a miracle!”
“Of course, your smile burns my eyes…”
“Then sleep more! Have you seen your raccoon eyes? Besides, smiling isn’t bad… You should smile more.”
“It’s not that easy to smile when you have no reason to…”

And Jeff was right. Divorced parents, bullying, emotional neglect—the perfect recipe for a sadist…
Every step Jeff took through the house echoed, a voice always responding, always watching, always judging…
Until, finally, good old Jeff picked up his box, his things, his life… and repeated the process—carrying, hauling, and dumping his belongings into his new room.
It was small. The walls, white as a dove; the bed, red as blood; and a window that opened to the empty backyard. The moon was at its peak, like a beautiful fruit about to fall from the tree. In the room, there was no more echo… only Jeff.

“How charming… tsk… Does everything I own have to be so… gloomy?”


He lay down on his bed, the warm and suffocating embrace of the sheets wrapping around his body. The faint creaking of branches against the window… the door to Jeff’s room, half-open, casting light over his entire body—except… his head.

It was clear. The darkness loved Jeff, but… does love differ from possession?

“What will this new school be like? I suppose… better than the last one. Woodsprings… I remember them, those damn bastards…”


Woodsprings? One often finds the truth along the path of forgetfulness…

“W-Why did I never fight back? I’m not that weak… am I?”


But the cruelest memories in life are like scars—marks on your skin that reflect victories… or shame. But… how long will he keep running from them?

“Tsk… Why didn’t I ever fight back?! Why didn’t I ever say anything?! But I didn’t want to look like a coward… right? I can still hear their damn insults…”


Until the memories decide to surface and attack without mercy, like so many creatures do. But they… they don’t hit you, they don’t insult you, no… they lock you inside your own mind:
“Hey, Woods! Where do you think you’re going, sissy?!”
“Leave me alone, Toby…”
“What?! I didn’t hear you, Jeffar!”

A shove. The monster had arrived. Tobias Archer, Randall Collins, and the others… names carved into Jeff’s back with blood, burned into his mind, haunting him.

“I said… leave me alone.”

“Ha! And what are you gonna do about it, huh? Call Jessica so she can change your diaper?”

“Not Jessica… because I swear I—“

“What? Say it, you daddy’s little abandoned bastard… come on, defend your girlfriend, let’s hear it.”

“I-I… I—“

POW!

The monster struck. Jeff’s blood dripped from his lips, his vision darkening like the night. The force of the hit sent him flying, stiff… like a tree being chopped down. Jeff’s life—an endless loop of pain, a cycle of torment.

“I don’t like waiting, Jeffy. Listen up—I’ve got a deal for you. What if you come to my party tonight, huh? You can say ‘I’ all you want there, and we can skip the whole clown act.”

“What? You just punched me, and now you’re talking about some stu—“

The monster grabbed Jeff by the collar, his disgusting eyes like the pits of hell—or at least, that’s how they looked to Jeff. His fiery breath burned against Jeff’s face, his pulse hammering like a war drum.

“I already told you, Jeff… You’re coming to my house, and you’re gonna prove that you’re worth something—even if it’s just a damn penny. And if you impress me… I might just stop messing with you. For a while… Heh. You know what you have to do, Jeffy. Don’t disappoint me…”

“But I—“

“234 Red House, Woodsprings, Jeffy. 7 p.m. Sharp. Alone. You know what to do… And hey, think of it as a favor—Jessica will be there too. Don’t tell me you don’t like her…”

“I don’t—“

“I don’t give a damn! You’re coming to my party tonight, and you’re gonna put on a damn good show. Unless… you want things to get worse for you. Got it?”

“…Yes…”

“Got it?!”

“Y-Yes!”

“That’s what I like to hear. And hey… if you’re coming, ditch those rags, you damn freak.”
…
The monster left, and with it, Jeff’s memory… He returned to his room, escaping the prison of his past, sweat dripping from his forehead, his breathing heavy, his chest rising… and falling… over and over again.

“Jeff…”

The voice was there. Jeff was just… there. But he couldn’t move. His eyes were still at the party, at the mistake, at October 13th…

“Jeff…”

What he did that night, what he lost and what he gained…

“JEFF!”

It wouldn’t stop. Jeff’s chest grew tighter, suffocating… like a rope that—

“JEFF!”

“AAAAH!”

“Well, it’s about time you woke up, lazy! What’s with that face?! You look like you’ve seen a ghost! Come on, or I’ll eat your dinner!”

It was Liu. The monsters decided to release Jeff for a while. He got up slowly, his eyes red like his bed, irritated by his own sweat, as if he couldn’t even blink…

“Ah… what?! You seriously woke me up for that?! Screw you, Liu!”

“Wow, looks like ‘Sleeping Beauty’ woke up in a bad mood… Anyway, just get downstairs already!”

“Pff! Not now, Liu!”

“Come on, Jeff! Or else… I’ll tell Mom you said the J-word!”

“The J-word…? Tsk…”

“Well? Do you wanna see Mom angry?!”

“Tsk… Fine, you win, Liu.”

“Like always, haha!”

“Heh… yeah… like always…”

The blood-ink of Jeff’s heart… Liu was his coffee—bitter, yet beloved. The only reason why he hadn’t…

But ink alone doesn’t write a story. It also takes desire, decision… and Jeff… he had none.

They went down the stairs, laughing, a small relief to the noose around Jeff’s neck…

“So, what did Mom cook, huh?”

“Cook? Pff! Don’t you know how lazy Mom is?! She ordered pizza, Jeff!”

“I heard you, Liu…”

“Oh! Sorry, Mom…”

“Well… finally something good in this place… tsk… At least a bit of cheese won’t kill me…”

Pizza—such a mundane thing in life, yet it was the assassin that widowed Jeff and murdered his spouse… guilt.
He sat at the table. The good Jeff could sit and eat just like us. Next to him was Liu, and across from him… “The warden,” his mother…

Margaret Woods, an ordinary woman who knows very little… mother of Jeff and Liu…

“Did you two settle into your rooms, kids?”

“I did already! My toys, my paintings, crayons, and—“

“Shut up, Liu! Tsk…”

“Hey Jeff, why are you so rude to your brother, huh?”

“Yeah, Jeff! Tell us!”

“Rude, me?! That brat is just… useless! Why doesn’t he look like me?!”

“Jeffrey!”

“What?! Am I lying?! Always with bad grades, breaking things like an idiot…”

“Jeff! Are you hearing yourself?! Your brother is younger than you, don’t ask too much from him…”

“Oh, sure! You asked me for whatever you wanted, didn’t you?!”

“Eh, mom, I…”

“Shut up, Liu! This is all your fault! Why can’t you stop bothering me, huh?! You and Margaret just keep meddling in my life!”

“Jeff! Calm down! Margaret?! Why are you calling me that?! I’m your mother!”

“Mother?! Ha! And where were you when I needed you?! You love to talk about being my mother… say it!”

“Where was I when you needed me?! Didn’t I attend your school plays?! Didn’t I work my ass off to buy this house?! Did you ever lack food, clothes, books?!”

“Yes! Why didn’t you defend me from him?!”

“From who?!”

“DAD!”

“D-Dad…?”

“I’m leaving!”

“Jeff…!”

Oh, the violinist was mentioned, curious, the divorce was born from infidelity. Could there be more to it?!... Jeff ran up the stairs, Liu just watched, but the mother… began to hunt down Jeff. The warden wanted to lock him up again…


The cheese, bright, fluffy, soft… a caress to Jeff’s soul, a reflection of his own pale face… The pepperoni, spicy, warm, round—a vicious circle of temporary pleasure for Jeff. And the crust… eh… who even likes that…?
“Jeff, come here!”

“N-No!”


The hunt continued, some tears fell from Jeff’s eyes, small drops from the storm in his mind, until finally…

VBRRR! CRASH!!

Jeff locked himself in his prison, his cell, his room… slamming the door hard before the jailer could start the interrogation…

“Jeff! Let me in, let’s talk!”

“NO! You never helped me, never… you never defended me from them! From HIM!!”


THUMP! … THUMP!

The door couldn’t hold any longer, the jailer was about to enter…

“JE—“


Hhngh… hh-ah… Ahhh—MOM!

“Liu!”


Liu’s scream caught the jailer’s attention, and she rushed to his aid… Why didn’t she do the same for Jeff? Interesting… maybe it’s because he never screamed, never spoke…

The echo of Liu’s cries crept into Jeff’s room, the noise grew more intense, louder… even the noise drowned Jeff out, he just stayed on the floor, curling up like a child… because that’s what he was…

“Damn it… snff… No… Why?! Why… ME?!!”


But the noise didn’t stop, nothing and no one set Jeff free, and if they did… it was only to deceive him.
Jeff covered his ears, but the noise kept going… his tears flowed like a river of blood, the storm… unleashed…

--October 13th, 2000… The Red House, 234 Woodsprings… 6:30 PM--
It was a particular night… after the incident, so to speak; with Tobias, Jeff had to go home… or else…

Jeff had to get permission, his grades were good, nothing special, nothing less, just… average.

He entered his house, the old house in Woodsprings… pictures of smiling clowns, others sad… the sofas, rough and beige, as if they couldn’t decide which color to use… or rather, time had erased their color…

Family photos, Jeff, Margaret, Liu… and him…

The house had green tapestries… a withered and desolate green…

“Mom, I’m home!”

“Wow! You finally get here… do you see what time it is?! I almost called the police!”

“Yeah, uh… well, what—“

“Nothing, young man! Now, you’ll explain what the hell you were doing, huh?!”


Jeff couldn’t say it, what would they think of him?! Besides, one of his chains is the most invisible… and heavy… shame.

“Uh, I…”

“I’m waiting, Jeff…”

“Uh… I was at the library, I-I was studying something about math, uh…”

“Hmm? And what’s the difference between arithmetic and algebra?!”

“Ah, uh… it’s…tsk…”

“Are you going to speak, young man?! If not… straight to your room with no video games for a month…”

“Uh… and I…”

“What?!”

“I was drawing at the park, okay?!”

“Drawing…”

“Yes, I—“

“Haha! So, Jeff Woods draws, huh? A miracle! And… what do you draw…?”

“Glup…”


Oh no, now he’ll have to show her all his drawings… of her.
The time after school is boring, really boring… Jeff just walks around the park until he reaches a bench by the lake and draws whatever comes to his mind, trees, squares, smiles, Jessica…
A school acquaintance, a light, a platonic and hormonal desire, natural among young people…

“Well?”

“Uh… and I… uh… trees, birds…”

“Hmm?! So Jeff, Jeff Woods draws trees and birds, right?”


Margaret grabbed Jeff’s backpack tightly, some books and pencils fell, but also… Jeff’s drawings.
Drawings of trees by a lake, portraits of the monster, but above all… the largest and most detailed one… The angel.

“Well, these don’t look like birds, Jeff… hmm, they’re quite weird, even for you. What books have you been reading, huh?”

“Uh… some by Lovecraft, Je… but that’s not the point…”

“Not the point? What are you plotting now, Jeff?”

“I wanted to ask for permission to—“

“If it involves a lot of money or another book, don’t even think about it!”

“It’s not that…”

“Then?”

“I-I want to ask for permission to go to a party… it’s at 7, at Tobias’s house, the son of the Archers…”

“A party…”

“Yes! But there won’t be alcohol, or anything bad! Also, it’s really close, like two streets away, please—“

“Yes! Sure, Jeff! You really surprise me today! Finally socializing!”


It seems getting permission wasn’t that hard after all, but… now it was time to go…
To the red house.
Jeff dressed appropriately—or rather, he just threw on a second-rate suit—and left. His mother still watched him from the porch, but there was no turning back now.
He walked a little, then a lot… until he reached the red house.

Shrill noises, some teenagers outside drinking special sodas (beer, obviously), and inside, a mix of electronic sounds and shouting.

Jeff moved through the crowd, uncomfortable, like a dragonfly hovering over a spider’s web. Inside, some kids were playing on consoles—the game itself was irrelevant—while others talked casually. And among them all, like a firefly cutting through the night, there she was…

For Jeff, everything else disappeared. It was just him and her—her hair shining like the moon, a moon in the middle of the darkness. He moved toward her, slowly, carefully. He was just about to—

“So you actually showed up, raccoon! Ha! Thought you’d chicken out!”

“Uh… hi, Toby…”

He was just about to talk to her, to make real the dream he’d always had… but the monster didn’t care for romance. No—he wanted to see… blood!

“Guys! The new kid’s here! Let’s welcome him!”

All eyes turned to Jeff. In the darkness, there were now eyes—eyes that clawed at him, tearing him apart, like an internal hemorrhage. And little by little, he bled out… in a very specific way. His cheeks, bathed in red—the classic, cruel… shame.

The angel had joined the stares as well. She no longer looked like an angel. She… she laughed. His face burned, turned bright red. Even she was laughing at him. And in that moment, Jeff understood—you can’t trust anyone. Not even angels. Or should he say… demons?

“Come on, Jeffy… don’t be shy! Give us a good sh—“

CRACK!

A sharp hit to Tobias’ face. Jeff let the ink spill—his small hatred turned into a hurricane. Whether it was natural or not no longer mattered. If our “knight” had chosen to fight the dragon, he had to be ready to burn in the battle…

“Who the hell do you think you are?!”

“Why don’t you just shut up, idiot?!”

THUMP!

The monster fought back too. Jeff’s cheeks burned hotter and hotter. In the dark, the eyes grew bigger, and from all around, a circle of manic mouths screamed in an infernal chorus:

“Fight, fight, fight…!”

THUMP! ZAZZZ!

“Think you’re tough?”

“Why don’t you just shut your mouth?”

The fight between the monster and Jeff continued—it was natural… if hitting each other like animals was “natural.”
The noise grew louder in Jeff’s ears—the chanting, the eyes, the monster—all of it weighing down on him.

“Enough!!”

“Look at him…!”

The fight stopped. The monster paused… but why?

“The raccoon comes to my house and punches me?! Ha! And now… he wants to back down?!”

“I-I…”

THUMP—TRACK—POW!

It was just a trap. The monster had set him up.

Jeff hit the ground, shame spilling from his nose, his fall—

CRACK!

It echoed through the whole room. For a moment, there was silence. The vast darkness was the only thing that stayed with Jeff… but then—

“Hahaha! Raccoon! Raccoon! Raccoon!”

Now, the darkness had vanished—replaced by a vast sea of red and white. A lip curled in a sneer, an eye mocking him.

“Enough! Please!”

“Hey, guys… haha, what do raccoons eat?”

“Trash, trash, trash!”

“How about we feed our little Jeffy?”

Two shadows grabbed Jeff, immobilizing him. The laughter grew, red smiles—a blood-red ocean drowning Jeff’s misery. The monster picked up a trash can.

“Open wide, Jeff!”

The shadows pried Jeff’s mouth open, stuffing it with garbage. Tch… tch… TCH! The crunch of filth between his teeth, his tears mixing with his meal. The monster was satisfied…

“What?! He actually ate it! Hahaha!”

“Aww, you that hungry, Jeff? Poor thing.”

“Hey, trash-eater! Why don’t you come to my place sometime? I could use some cleaning!”

Jeff… silence… silence… si—

“SILEEENN—“

THUMP!

A kick to Jeff’s face. The monster, satisfied, couldn’t leave without a grand finale…

“Alright, guys! Let’s take out the trash!”

“Yeah! Take him out! Take him out!”

The shadows lifted Jeff, carried him to the door, and threw him out onto the street. Like garbage…

“Great show, Jeff! See you Monday at school, Jeffy! Hahaha!”

And the last face he saw before the door shut… was Jessica’s.

“Tsk… what a freak…”

THUMP—TRACK—

And the door closed.
W-Why…b-but…they…they can’t do this to me!


THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

Open up! Tobias!... TOBIAS! OPEN UP! TOBIAS! …p-please…


Why does the hero want to return to the abyss? … Revenge, rage… pain?

P-please…open up…


But there was no response, only… laughter.

Tsk…

Jeff walked back home. At the door… there he was. The violinist, his violin, and his bow. It was him, his father… his rod and his belt… and the melody… the sound of Jeff’s screams as he was whipped… but… even as he felt every strike, every drop of clotted blood… all he could see was his mother, screaming at his father to stop, but doing nothing… just noise…

………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

And now, back to the room, back to reality… Liu’s screams, Margaret’s, but Jeff remained on the floor of his room… the darkness, even the moon, was drowned out…

P-Please…


But Jeff’s eyes dried out, and his rage was born… after so long…

Die, you bastards! DIE!


He started punching his bed. Why? … Does there have to be a why?!

WH—


THUMP!

Y—


THUMP!

ME?!—


CRACK!

And the bed broke… Jeff’s hands filled with splinters, wounds, blood… pain… something he had always felt, always… and it felt good!

HAHAHAHA!


But pain also brings sadness, and between laughter… and tears… Jeff… passed out…

Made a calendar and list app that you can share between 2 users, more soon. With a list feature that each user can tick off items (such as shopping on the way back from work) - quick check to see what's left on the list and boom. You can also use the chat function to add lists or events into the chat to ping me or remind me.

I made it extremely easy to use and nicely designed.

I'm looking to market this somehow, Google ads? Insta? Not really used to it. What are some ways that marketing a PWA app worked?

1jnep2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/transgender_dating/comments/1jnep2c/why_every_single_trans_person_should_go_on/,# Why Every Single (Trans) Person Should Go on Beautiful Solo Dates,"

Let’s talk about something radical—but also really simple: **taking yourself on a beautiful date**. Yes, just you.

Today, I went to the cinema by myself. Afterwards, I treated myself to a gorgeous slice of Persian cake and a cup of Persian saffron black tea. I sat there soaking in the atmosphere, not waiting for anyone, not trying to impress anyone—just enjoying the moment. And it hit me: I used to always wait for a guy to invite me to this coffee place. But then I thought, *why am I waiting?* What if that invitation never comes? Why would I deny myself a beautiful experience just because I’m single?

That was a game-changer.

When you're single—trans or not—it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that romance, luxury, or special experiences are only valid if someone else brings them into your life. But the truth is, we can—and should—be our own lovers first.  
**You deserve the cake. You deserve the cinema night. You deserve to be seen, cherished, and celebrated—even if it's just by you.**

Building a good relationship with yourself is the most foundational kind of intimacy. If you're dating out of loneliness, trying to fill a void, it often leads to pain, confusion, or settling for less than you deserve. But if you're dating because you're full of life, full of love for yourself, and excited to *share* your world with someone—that’s when real connection begins.

So go out. Dress up for you. Buy yourself flowers. Book that solo dinner at the cute restaurant you've always wanted to try. Laugh at the movie alone. Take selfies like you're on a date—because you are. **With yourself.**

Because if you’re comfortable in your own company, you’re not waiting—you’re living.

And trust me, the right people are drawn to someone who truly enjoys their own presence.

---

So yeah... it’s just so wonderful to sit in a café, admire the beauty of other women, watch people walk by, soak it all in—and feel totally good being there by yourself.  
If you're happy within yourself, everything else is just a bonus.  
**It really starts with you.**

Love you all,  
Big kisses,

I (M23) drove to her (F21) picked her up She mentioned smoking weed (I don’t really like being around d*ugs) and being SA’d in her past whilst we were casually sipping coffee and I found that a bit off putting although being this was my first ever date I have no clue what normal things to talk about are. So nearly towards the end of the date I invite her to my house (the conversation was getting dry and I didn’t know what to say) and when we pulled up on my driveway she started touching my arm and rubbing her hands all over me… at that moment I forgot I was a virgin 😂 I freaked out and froze literally and I somehow managed to change going into my house to instead let’s go on a hiking trail in the woods… yeah. for the last three hours on the date she made it very clear that it was ok for me to make a move but I was so freaked out and nervous to the point that I felt like throwing up. Understandably she unmatched me after that date I drowned myself in whiskey for a month after that. I’ve always understood that tinder dates are about hook ups but I wasn’t ready to experience the reality of what that really feels like I just wanted to take things slow although I probably wasn’t good at communicating that especially since I may have led her on by inviting her to my house.,2,1743347968.0,tinderstories,0,1.0,False
1jneoir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jneoir/a_newbie_reviews_alkemia_part_3_tea_and_books/,A newbie reviews Alkemia PART 3: Tea and books!,"Hello everyone! I’m back with my painstaking journey of taking notes through my endless collection of Alkemia samples and connecting pins on a corkboard of fragrance notes in my effort to learn to figure out what I like in a fragrance. Why Alkemia? Because I’m in the EU (although - I just got my first Solstice Scents order from FFC and I have to say I’m impressed by the performance!). For this bunch of reviews I grouped together some fragrances based on books and tea. My past reviews included some with tea notes, but I didn’t find them tea-dominant (except for Whisper of Stars, which smells like jasmine tea).

**INK**

**BOOK OF SHADOWS (heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses)**.  No idea what I smell in the vial - it’s not leather nor incense. I guess it has to be ink and paper, but I wouldn’t call it “books” either. Something astringent - maybe that’s just ink. On the skin: an IMMEDIATE overpowering smell I’d call “bitter incense”. The incense that was completely missing from the bottle is the single strongest note on the skin. I’m a bit confused by the bitterness - looking at Fragantica reviews, some people said they believe this had an unlisted “bitter almond/cyanide” note. Looking it up, it seems that other than bitter almonds, this smell is associated with cherry - which makes sense, because at times I felt if I really focused I could find an almost medicinal cherry smell. Good to know I’m not crazy! Very faint though, and I have no idea if Alkemia uses it for their ink or their paper note. It could be paper - people seemingly complain perfumers use vanilla for book scents, but I don’t get vanilla from any of these fragrances. Perhaps this note is where they get it. The incense is overpowering for the first 15-20 minutes, where it calms down - only THEN can you start smelling the leather if you focus. At this point the fragrance has three layers: the smoky incense, which is the clearest. At the base, the faintest leather. And sandwiched in between, something that I do believe somewhat realistically evokes “parchment and ink”. The smokiness is the type that goes up your nostrils and you feel in your throat - but that could also be the initial astringency, as I got the same reaction from the vial. After an hour or so, I’d say the fragrance is entirely leather forward - a smooth, lowkey leather. It’s VERY androgynous. While the paper and ink notes are somewhat successful, I don’t think I love incense-forward smells on me. **5/10**

**THE RAVEN (ebony heartwood, black amber, piper nigrum, blackseed (habbatul barakah), black Bengal cardamon, black ink, nigella (black coriander), black iris, violet leaves, and leather.)**: The first smell I get is “dusty” - I’m pretty sure I pick up on this dusty note in Alkemia’s cardamom-forward scents, so I think it’s the spices. The ink feels stronger here, while Book of Shadows is more papery. Finally - there’s definitely something floral, but a more green, “jar of flowers on the desk” floral than a typical identifiable floral note. I guess it’s the iris. It’s well blended with everything else. On the skin: the floral a bit less strong, a bit more of the bitter greens (violet leaf). The spices are also less strong, mostly a faint dusty note on top of the ebony wood.  I wrote down “I swear I could compare it to Lord of Misrule” (the Lush shower gel). I’ve unfortunately since finished my gel, so I can’t confirm, but looking at the notes - black pepper, patchouli, vanilla - means the black pepper is very easily identifiable. If Book of Shadows is unisex, this one is a bit masculine - might be the wood and leather making me think of cologne. It’s a bit less astringent than what I’d associate with men’s cologne though, which is nice. There is no warmth as I’d expect from the “black amber”. The leather is there from the beginning, rather than hiding in the background. It’s VERY cold and, for a lack of a better word, velvety. While it feels like a leather scent rather than ink, it being paired with the velvety iris and the green violet leaf makes it distinct from other leather fragrances. It’s not a very complex scent - I feel you can easily pick apart the individual notes of ink, black pepper/cardamom, iris and leather - and a bit more in the background, wood. It comes together into something beautiful and evocative, though. It almost runs the risk of turning “old perfume”, which I think is my association with iris, but I think it barely avoids it and becomes something mature and mysterious.  If you want a leather perfume but find most of them too masc, I think this is a very beautiful blend of leather and floral.  **8/10**, seriously considered a FS.

**LEGAL TENDER (printers ink, pressed cotton, clean linen, aliphatic aldehydes, vegan tallow, and imprints from a hot steel press, combined with subtle touches of elegant leather wallets, Iso E, Adenium, rare orchids, and resilient Hoya)**: Technically an ink fragrance. In the vial, there’s an immediate BO smell, to be honest. Must be either the tallow or the Iso E. Under that, there is the floral cleanliness of linen, cotton and orchids. I can easily distinguish these 3 smells, but I don’t think I can isolate the ink - but if I had to guess, it’s the sweet astringency. On the skin, it’s cotton. I get a bit of Alkemia’s sweet fizzy aldehydes, a bit of the floral notes, definitely animalic. I think what makes this smell so strange is the mix of “dirtier” notes (tallow, leather) and “clean” ones (linen, cotton, Iso E). It feels like… A mix of dirty musk and laundry. The florals are not very strong at all, they’re there at the beginning but fade away. There is a bit of a metallic note that I can feel in my tongue. It’s a bit masculine. I can’t say I love it - strongly clean scents (as in cotton and cedar) aren’t my favorite, and that combined with the animalic notes makes it smell “actually dirty” rather than sexy dirty. Like… soiled cotton… But if I use my imagination, I can imagine why that would smell like freshly printed bills? Um, **2/10** I guess, it’s not terribly offensive but it could be, on the wrong person.

**BIBLIOTHECA (leatherbound books, plush club chairs, vintage vinyl records, polished mahogany tables, fountain pen ink, black tea, dark plum brandy, vetiver, rosewood, artemisia, white carnation, lavender water, citron, tweedy woolens, and oakmoss)**: This is very different from the others - in the vial, it’s the first one that makes me think “men’s cologne”. From experience, I’m starting to believe that smell is vetiver, but I’m not quite sure yet. Other than that, I get something VERY realistic in the vial - dusty, and metallic, and plastic. But not in a bad way! It’s actually sort of taking me to this hypothetical room with club chairs and a pool table. The wood is there, the florals, herbs and tea are not. On the skin - I think the tea actually slightly comes through. It’s immediately woodsy, and I can actually smell the floral notes now. Moreso the carnation than the lavender. It’s leather-forward, and I could swear there’s almost something salty about it. This does not make me think of books, nor libraries, it’s a “gentlemen’s club” sort of smell. There is some booze from the brandy going up my nostrils. Definitely a “professor wearing a tweed jacket” smell. I don’t usually have the “Alkemia smells soapy” problem, but I think this fragrance might smell a bit soapy.  There is a slight smokiness, maybe from the tea. After a while, it’s faintly smoky wood with a bit of leather. It’s nice, and it kind of takes you to being in this fancy room, but otherwise **6/10**

**THE BOOKS**

**OLD BOOKS AND FRESH FLOWERS (Fresh neroli orange flowers and heliotrope blossoms pressed between the delicate paper pages of a leather-bound book)**: Now, I’m not sure what neroli smells like, but if it smells anything like orange blossom - in the vial, this has to be 100% heliotrope. It’s a floral smell I can only describe as “juicy”, bizarrely. There’s a definite almond note, which is apparently a feature of heliotrope. This is actually a shockingly strong smell in the vial. On the skin: I can hardly perceive any leather. It’s mostly floral, a sharper, greneer floral than the sweeter, juicier one of the vial - perhaps the neroli comes out more. If it’s the neroli, it’s not very pleasant, honestly - it makes me think of bug repellant. My conclusion is that if you know you enjoy neroli and heliotrope, you’ll enjoy this, because the leatherbound books are there but very much act as a background. After the initial almost unpleasantly sharp greens and florals, it does calm down - but unfortunately, I feel as it settles down to a more pleasant, papery scent it also becomes weaker. This is AFTER resting, too, so I’m disappointed. It sort of turns into a more generic powdery foral after 1-2 hours. It’s not actively bad but **5/10**

**DUSTSCEAWUNG (dust, attic air, the inside of old trunks, abandoned haylofts, library stacks, and abandoned buildings)**: Total opposite - very faint in the vial, but comes out in the skin. This and Old Books are both the type of fragrances I could pick out of a line blind - no other Alkemia fragrance smells anything like this, I think. It very much makes me think “dust”, and specifically I’m pretty sure I pick up hay.. There is a definite earthiness to it, but it’s somewhat dusty, not wet, and without any greens. Mostly it just stays as a hay fragrance throughout, but a dry one, so it’s a “green” scent but barely. The books mayyy be there but if so, way in the background compared to the hay. The “abandoned buildings” part doesn’t imply the same musty smell of St. Louis Cemetery #1, if that’s something you want to avoid - it’s a pleasant and simple but rather unique hay scent, really. **7/10**

**TEA**

**NOVELLA (Lavender de Provence, steaming Earl Gray tea, and tattered old paperback books.)**. I honestly don’t have much to say about this one other than “smells like Earl Gray”. Immediately on the skin it’s PURE earl grey - the tea is strong and the bergamot is loud - almost balsamic, oily. I can’t smell the lavender. The books may be there, in the background. It’s not complex at all but it’s beautiful and comforting, and if you want to smell like literal Earl Gray it’s a 10/10. I’d give it a **8/10** because I’d consider FSing, but…

**PERSIAN TEA ROOM (Spiced black tea, dry desert sand, and Silk Road spices infused with the sensual promise of enticing musk and a flirtatious kiss of soft leather.)**. On the skin it’s immediate leather. The tea is there, but not as in-your-face as Novella. The spices are not overpowering, but I do feel they lean cinnamony, if that’s something you’re sensitive to. Again, they don’t go full “cinnamon chewing gum” on me (other Alkemia smells have…), or black peppery like The Raven - I would also say there’s clove in there. It’s a VERY dry smell, nothing green or fresh or aquatic to it, and definitely on the masc side of unisex. It’s one of the few scents here that really scream TEA, but in a very different way from Novella. Novella is warm and nostalgic, like curling up with a blanket - this feels more like being in a market stall that is selling and brewing tea. Personally? I love it. I find it simultaneously romantic and a bit mysterious, and I love tea, and I was always on the hunt for a fragrance that I felt leaned masculine but did not smell “men’s cologne” on me (I am still trying to identify what notes makes me think that - as I said, suspect #1 is vetiver). So this one hits all of those notes for me. There is a bit of an atemporal quality to this fragrance, like I could imagine someone 1000 years ago smelling like this. I wish I were better with words! This is just really lovely leather and tea with spices - the musk is very present but it’s tying everything together, i feel. **9/10**, my alcohol-free spray arrived today and I got sad it didn’t smell exactly the same - BUT this is an old sample and I know Alkemia needs resting.

**BOOK OF NIGHT (artemisia, oakmoss, blue juniper berries, black patchouli, sweet pipe tobacco, clove, incense resins, cashmere, chai tea).** A bit intimidating to describe, but I’ll try because of the chai tea note. Though spoilers: this is not a tea scent! On the vial: cologney herbal greens, which I believe is artemisia - it’s not overpoweringly patchouli. On the skin: again, a bit fresh and green. The patchouli’s in the background, and honestly - it reminds me of Baccante (a super realistic, bitter, overpoweringly green fresh blueberry bush) if it were a bit more like a men’s cologne. The smokiness of the incense and tobacco are not there at the beginning, I think it’s a background of patchouli with the green artemisia and berries in front (and oakmoss? Alkemia’s “oakmoss” is different from their “moss”, I think - less realistic and more masculine.). I could mayyybe, MAYBE smell tea but it has to be way blended with the tobacco. I’d describe this as an ambery fragrance with a green start. The green aspect goes away relatively fast and what stays is - something oddly sweet, which I think is the patchouli (maybe the resin?). Something powdery, which I think is also how patchouli goes on me. And something smoky, more incense than tobacco. It sort of brings it from masc back to uni sex. Already wet on the skin there’s hints of that Alkemia incense note that is slightly headachey to me - bordering on soapy. I could see myself wearing this to, say, dinner night. I do think these notes play well together and it’s a good concept, but it doesn’t wow me - I’ve worn EdPs from Rituals that smelled pretty close to this, I think, that same “heady date night fragrance with berries” feel. **6/10**

**AS DARK THINGS ARE MEANT TO BE LOVED (Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.)** So many notes I’m unfamiliar with! In the vial, this smells delicious - lapsang souchong, coffee and black coconut. I’ll say the tea is hard to distinguish due to its overlap with tobacco (as lapsang souchong is a smoked tea) and coffee, but it’s great nonetheless. I just received “Writer’s Blood” (blood, paper, coffee, tobacco) and it’s definitely an adjacent fragrance to this. I’m not gonna claim I can tell amber apart from patchouli apart from breuzinho apart from bhakoor apart from labdanum apart from opium… But if I HAD to guess, the opium is also heavily there, a somewhat creamy, caramelly but almost herbal smell. On the skin: the coconut is prominent, but not the piña colada kind. Opium and, as far as smokiness goes, I’d say the tobacco overpowers the tea. It’s VERY heavy, but not in a cloying sweet way, rather in a… sticky and almost smoky way. It’s ambery first and foremost. I think these notes all blend beautifully. I don’t think I get any leather. I find this delicious, and I wouldn’t worry about offending people with this because, honestly, Alkemia has no throw on me lol.The lapsang souchong is not a prominent player, if it’s there it’s blending with everything else, so this is not a tea scent. I’ve seen people compare the opening to coca cola or root beer and I can see it, but god knows why - I think it’s something about the caramel note. It’s sweet without being gourmand, but does lean feminine. This one doesn’t take very long to start being less sweet and more smoky - it basically settles on an amber with hints of opium. **9/10** seriously considering a FS of this, but I need to compare it so other ambery smells.

Finally: two of the 2025 Spring smells. They’ve only rested for a couple of days so the reviews aren’t very finalized and the rested smell may be different. However:

**ENCHANTEÉ (fresh green tea, fallen cherry blossoms, red cherry musk, bamboo, sandalwood, and shaded moss.)**. This disappointed me a bit! In the vial, musk and sandalwood, with a bit of syrupy sweetness. On the skin: mostly sandalwood, MAYBE a bit of green tea - it’s a sort of bitter note complimenting the sandalwood. The cherries aren’t overpowering, but all of these scents combined result in something almost… A bit soapy? This is primarily a sandalwood fragrance with some green notes, pink florals and the faintest syrup, and the result feels a bit… discordant? I wouldn’t go out of my way to wear this. 4/10, but I’ll revisit it after resting.

**TEMPEST IN A TEACUP (Russian black tea, shattered bone china, the ozone of passing thunderclouds, and rain-damp suede.)**. In the vial it’s fizzy and ozonic. On the skin: IMMEDIATE black tea. It almost feels Earl Grey - I don’t know if it’s the aldehydes making me think citrus? The suede is present but blends perfectly with the black tea. Wrist to wrist versus Persian Tea Room: PTR is more leathery with black tea and spices in the background. Tempest is more black tea dominant and has an almost citrus quality to it - it’s the suede that’s in the background. PTR is dry and spices, Tempest borders on fresh. I prefer PST, but this is a really nice scent! Maybe the second most “true tea” smell after Novella. **7/10**

Since I ramble a lot, TL;DR version of my reviews. Wear…

Book of Shadows if you want to smell like incense and books.

The Raven if you want to smell like iris, black pepper and leather.

Legal Tender if you want to smell like ………. A dirty diaper (sorry…)

Bibliotheca if you want to smell like brandy, polished desks and vinyls.

Old Books and Fresh Flowers if you want to smell like heliotrope.

Dustsceawung if you want to smell like dry hay.

Novella if you want to smell like Earl Grey.

Persian Tea Room if you want to smell like leather, black tea, cinnamon and clove.

Book of Night if you want to smell like a green berry bush, patchouli and incense.

As Dark Things are Meant to be Loved if you want to smell like coffee, caramelized coconut and opium.

Enchanteé if you want to smell like sandalwood, cherry syrup and pink florals.

Tempest in a Teacup if you want to smell like black tea and fizzy citrus.

And that’s it! Maybe I’ll take a small break of sniffing all my vials again, taking notes of the notes I can pick up and which vials to use up and which ones to keep for comparison’s sake - but I’m thinning of going for their candy and/or lactonic and/or white amber smell after this.

There is some times I open full screen game and they lag my model. My CPU and memory are both under or around 50% at that time so I don't understand what causes the issue.

Option to have all games in windowed mode would be more nicer for control but idk how to go about that

I also don't know how to have a fixed setup in OBS. For example when I open a game the screen size jumps all around depending how big the game is.

Relating to previous question I don't know at what point streamers set assets for background like chat window and the window for game. Is there some middle program for that when they go live? Or does it also happen in OBS.

And then the question of setting mic sound and gaming sound; is there easy way to test that those are in good levels. So far in my recordings either my mic is too high or low or game is too high or low. I don't really know is there any preview function in obs.

**Why This Pick?**

The Suns were on a nice run there for a bit, friends – but to be honest, nothing about them really appeals to me at this stage. Phoenix allowed more than 124 points in both of their last outings/losses, while Houston has won 11 of their last 12 games and bagged over 120 points in both of their last victories. The Rockets play far better defense than the Suns, and all of their last 11 wins have been by more than 2. To boot, one of those wins includes an encounter with the Suns (which the Rockets won by 7). Give me Houston to cover on the road for the nice price.

I have met someone who is a board of directors for a company and since offered me a trial shift after an informal conversation over coffee.

I know how the general consensus is for Companies offering trial shifts in this Reddit is less than favourable but this is an opportunity to break into an industry that I would prefer (Currently stuck in Retail) and more importantly (To say Bluntly and honestly) To not feel like a failure at the age of 27 wishing to Marry my partner, own a property and eventually have children with her. I know these can be done no matter how financially well off (or not) I am, but this will be potentially be a shift from £18,000PA to £28,000/£30,000 a year starting - And thus will give me more financial stability to have a life I wish and have been striving for so long to have. 

My question is, This role is an Office based job, more on the logistics side, but what would a Trial Shift entail? I have little experience in this field but I am more than willing to learn. 
My Anxiety and stress is wearing me thin worrying about this Trial shift, and would hope someone in this sub can provide some potential happening that May or may not happen on the day.

1jnekug,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jnekug/i_lost_everything_im_homeless_and_alone/,I lost everything. I'm homeless and alone.,"I don't know how to get over this. A week ago I was visiting a friend in another state and my boyfriend told me that he didn't want to see me again. At the airport he was a normal boyfriend saying ""I'm gonna miss you"" and then I got that message 5 days later.

It is not the breakup that has me like this, is the way I literally lost everything and when I told him he answered ""me too"". That is not true at all, he lost me and that's it, his life remains the same. Let me explain a little bit.

I tried to kill myself OD me last week and woke up at the hospital. I spent two days there in terrible conditions. I didn't have a bed and didn't eat or drink properly. Then the psychiatrist came and told me that they were taking so long because my (ex) boyfriend didn't want me back home (it's his family's so I have no option). Basically I was homeless and they couldn't let me out like that. Finally they contacted my father and he came and brought me to his house.

There are a few problems here: my father is abusive and always has been. I ran away from him 3 years ago because he is a sexually and mentally abusive alcoholic. I was living a nightmare back there. He is an accumulator and his house is full of garbage and really dirty. I remember being 8 or 9 and waking up in the middle of the night with him on top of me. When he realized I had my eyes open, he ran away. It was always in our (my sister's too) sleep. He likes to spy and other creepy things like that. As you can imagine, he is not the best person to have next to you while recovering from a suicide attempt. Neither the shitty house.

So, on Friday's night, I realized the abuse was back. Caught him getting into my room at 6am. I woke up agitated and told him what was he doing. He pretended that he was going to check something about the window, claiming it was broken (there was no problem with that, he just opened and closed it). Then he went out. Then at 8am, I hadn't been able to sleep, he came in again. This time asking about my car key, which I had to hide because he wanted to use it as it was his, with no permission. I told him I had it and he left. Again, at 12pm, me still in bed feeling like shit, still not being able to sleep, he came in again. I told him I really needed to sleep and he ignored me and again pretended to fix something from the window. This time, he opened the window wide, raised the blinds and I had all that sunlight in my face. I told him ""Dad, why don't you let me sleep?"" and he yelled ""I PAID $150 FOR THIS WINDOW"". During all that time between 6am and 12 pm he was being so noisy around the house hitting things. I could hear him even while wearing earplugs.

I finally gave up trying to sleep and went downstairs. He asked me if I knew something about my medical tratment (I'm waiting for the Doctor to call me) and I told him no. I was so tired just sleeping 4 hours in two nights and apparently he didn't like my tone. He started yelling, I can't even remember what he said, just yelling a lot. I decided I had enough.

I prepared everything and left that abusive house with my 14 year old dog. I slept in the car, I have nowhere to go. This morning I woke up shivering and with snot hanging from my nose. As a female, I spent the night very scared and alert. Just me and my dog in a car, not even in my worst nightmares I could have seen myself in this situation.

What hurts me the most is that he has the same situation than before leaving me, life, house, things and even our cats (he kept them with no negotiation), he also has a supportive family and I literally lost everything and he thinks we're in the same situation dealing with grief. It is not my case, I have no family, lost my cats forever, and I'm homeless. Where's my morning coffee machine? My dishwasher? All the furniture I bought and assembled without his help? Where are my babies? Our big TV where we used to play games and watch movies? Where's my fucking life? He still has all that even without me. It's not about the grief, I have nothing and I'm alone. His life is exactly the same just without me. We are not going through the same thing by any stretch of the imagination.

Why is he doing this to me? I mean, yes, you're free to go even if it destroys me but, kicking me out of the house? He blocked me everywhere and remains sillent, haven't seen him since the airport and I can only talk to his mom to take my things back but, where do I put my entire life while being homeless??

I woke up in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt, then went back to my abusive father's house and then homeless. This is a fucking nightmare. And he doesn't care. What hurts me the most is he doesn't care and is just dealing with a normal breakup grief. I would never put him in this situation, even if I wanted to end the relationship. Have some respect for someone you loved and shared your life with.

TLDR: bf kicked me out of the house, I had to go back to my mentally and sexually alcoholic father's house and when the abused started again, I decided it was better to be homeless than living with that demon. Ex boyfriend remains completely silent and doesn't care about my welfare.

I want to get a gooseneck kettle next and I found three types so far:

a basic pouring kettle, something like this benki one: [https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/collections/kettles/products/benki-gooseneck-kettle-without-lid](https://www.benkibrewingtools.com/collections/kettles/products/benki-gooseneck-kettle-without-lid)

and a electric temperature-controlled kettle like this Sipologie one: [https://amzn.in/d/3ux8Ex0](https://amzn.in/d/3ux8Ex0)

What would you all recommend, the max i'm willing to spend is around 7-8k.

I'm doing a year-long tour around S. America and will stay in Chile from June to September. Initially, I was going to pick Santiago, but between the smog (big outdoor runner) and what I've heard generally about it not being as culturally lively as other S. American cities, I wanted to explore alternatives (have not necessarily ruled out Santiago). When I think of the places I've visited that I loved the most, Zürich and Chania pop up at the top of my list, so I'm kind of looking for similar places and similar sizes.

Things I'm looking for:

* Picturesque views
* Skiing nearby
* Some semblance of nightlife. 4-floor discos are not necessary, but I'd like a small collection of bars/pubs to meet people and get a drink.
* Decent internet. I'm a video editor who works remotely so I need to upload/download large files.
* Relatively affordable (mostly looking at Patagonia here, most of the airbnbs we're pretty pricey when I checked there.)
* A good collection of restaurants/good food
* A nice collection of cultural experiences (not necessary, though)
* at least one cafe to get a glass of wine during the day. (Or potentially coffee since it'll be winter)
* Relatively safe. I'm still learning to navigate S. America as an American and I travel with an expensive laptop.

I'm also open to countries near the area. I'll have maxed out my visa stay in Argentina and am going to Peru after Chile, so those two are off the table, but anywhere else in the region works.",0,1743347133.0,digitalnomad,1,0.5,False

## Why Choose a Storage Tower?

Before we delve into our top picks, let’s explore the key benefits of investing in a storage tower. These versatile units offer a plethora of advantages over traditional storage options:

*   **Space Optimization:** The primary appeal of a storage tower lies in its ability to maximize vertical space. If you’re short on floor space, a tall storage unit is your best friend. Rather of sprawling outwards, these towers reach upwards, utilizing frequently enough-overlooked areas of your home. This is especially crucial for apartment dwellers and college students living in constricted environments. Even small business owners operating from home can benefit from the vertical advantage of a storage rack tower, freeing up valuable desk space.

*   **Institution and Accessibility:** Storage towers provide dedicated compartments for different items. A storage tower with drawers allows for discreet storage of smaller items, while open shelving lets you display decorative pieces or easily grab frequently used items. This segmentation promotes organization and makes it easier to find what you need when you need it.

*   **Versatility:** Storage towers aren’t limited to one room or purpose. A bathroom storage tower can corral toiletries, towels, and cleaning supplies. A kitchen storage tower can hold pantry staples, cookware, or even act as a stylish coffee station. A bedroom storage tower can organize clothing, accessories, or books. An office storage tower can manage documents, supplies, and equipment. The adaptability of a storage tower makes it a smart investment for any space. DIY enthusiasts can find excellent use for an organizing tower to systematize their material.

*   **Aesthetics:** Storage doesn’t have to be an eyesore. modern storage towers come in a variety of styles, from sleek and minimalist to rustic and charming. You can find a unit that complements your existing décor and enhances the overall look of your space. This is especially crucial for home organizers who prioritize both functionality and aesthetics.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Storage Tower

With so many options available, choosing the right storage tower can feel overwhelming.To simplify the process, here are some key factors to consider:

*   **Size and Dimensions:** Measure the space where you plan to place the storage tower.Pay attention to both the height and width to ensure a proper fit. If you have a notably narrow space, a narrow storage tower or a slim storage tower is ideal. Don't forget to account for any obstructions, such as doorways or windows. Also,determine what you’d like to store,and whether you’d prefer a tall storage unit or a small storage tower.*   **material and Durability:** Storage towers are typically made from wood, metal, plastic, or a combination of materials.wood offers a classic and sturdy look, while metal is known for its durability and sleekness. Plastic is a more affordable option that is lightweight and easy to clean. Consider the weight of the items you plan to store and choose a material that can handle the load. The frame should be sturdy, and the drawers or shelves should be able to withstand regular use.

*   **Storage Type:** Determine what type of storage you need. A storage tower with drawers is great for concealing clutter and keeping items organized. Open shelving is ideal for displaying items or storing frequently used items. Some units offer a combination of both, providing the best of both worlds. If you have items you want to keep out of sight, consider a storage tower with doors.

*   **Style and Design:** Choose a storage tower that complements your existing décor. Consider the color, finish, and overall style of the unit. Whether you prefer a modern, minimalist look or a rustic, farmhouse feel, there’s a storage tower to match your taste.

*   **Mobility:** If you plan to move the storage tower frequently, consider a rolling storage tower. These units are equipped with wheels,making them easy to transport from one room to another. This is especially useful for college students who may need to move their belongings frequently.

*   **Adjustability:** An adjustable storage tower allows you to customize the height of the shelves to accommodate items of different sizes.This is a great feature if you plan to store a variety of items, from books to bins.

*   **Budget:** Storage towers range in price from affordable to high-end. Determine your budget before you start shopping to narrow down your options. Remember that quality is often reflected in price,so consider investing in a durable unit that will last for years to come.

The header pretty much sums up my problem but I'll give some deets. Before I start, I had told my bf I don't care if he plays as long as he doesn't do what my ex did, my ex paid more attention to his games then myself and that caused a lot of issues and I eventually cut his cords. I told my bf why I did what I did and he seemed to understand. My bf plays his games every single day religiously. I've brought up about getting me a controller so I can at least play with him so I don't feel so left out and he always says ""yeah we'll see."" So I have up on asking bc it's been a year and still nothing. We got a dog together during the holidays (I already had my dog coming into this relationship)and I thought he would mayb cool it down some with the games and be more present and engaging with the dogs but no. There's plenty of times he said he's ""tired"" after work or ""doesn't feel good"", so I'll take the dogs to the park and play with them to let them roam and be free and have fun since they're stuck inside while we're at work. And as soon as I leave I get RING notifications and see him playing his videos games. Or on weekends, I feel like if I don't bring up taking them to dog parks or taking them out and about, he won't bring it up. He's fine taking the dogs potty when we get home from work and calling it a day so he can go on his gaming consoles. When he's finally ready to turn off the games and ""spend time"" with me, he's always scrolling on his phone whether it's TikTok, Reddit, etc. It's frustrating bc when we're watching TV and something happens I'll look at him like ""OMG can you believe that!?"" and he'll be like""huh? What happened?"" and it's like, well mayb if you weren't on your phone you'd kno wtf I'm talking about. Or when I'm making dinner or baking him something, I've tried asking him to come keep me company and let's just hangout while I cook/bake or mayb we can do it together and he always ops for playing his game or scrolling on the phone. I will say he did couple days ago and I think that's bc I nagged him into it, something I don't wanna do. I want him to just come and hangout and be present with me and the dogs bc he wants to, not bc I'm nagging him or he feels forced. On weekends we'll normally stay in bed till about 9ish or so. Usually I'm still sleeping and he'll be laying next to me drinking coffee and on his phone or reading a book. We'll today he leaves to go play his game a little before 8 and I woke up a little after 8 and asked why he left to go play his games. He said bc I'm sleeping and I'm starting to feel a little sick (sore throat). Mayb I'm being a baby but if the roles were reversed I would have stayed in bed and rubbed him and seen it he needed anything or ask how he's feeling.

**A little whiny so feel freeto skip:** So I (23M) have never been in a relationship, and honestly the primary reason is that I've never really tried. I've always been focused on my work and friendships and a romantic relationship has never ever really happened. However over the past few year or so its kinda been getting to me, and I've realised that a relationship is probably not gonna just appear on my lap, so if I dont wanna die alone I should probably start sooner rather than later. I've decided to try and focus on dating and building my exprience just like I focus on my work and friends. **To be clear, I do want a GF**, this isn't just me trying to lose my virginity or build experience (although I admit that these are factors). Ultimately I'm looking for a women I can spend time with and share our lives together (maybe a big ask, idk).

  
**About me/my experience:** I would say I'm average looking, I have a very good friend network so I'd say I'm reasonably social. I do get nervous however when it comes to talking with women if there is potential for anything non-platonic, or if I'm interested in them. In the past, I've struggled with dates such as coffee/bar/pub dates because I usually run out of things to say (most likely just not compatible). I've also struggled getting a second date, and in fact have never had a second date, just a few first dates that never went anywhere :/

So, I'm looking for advice on how to start regularly and successfully dating (i.e getting to that second date). In particular, I'd like on advice on any of the following:

1. Suggestions on meeting women outwith dating apps?
2. Date ideas that aren't just coffee or drinks? Or good ideas for second dates? (trying to be optimistic :p)
3. Ways to improve matches on dating apps (my experience: the average dudes experience on dating apps, maybe 1-2 matches a month on average)
4. Advice on dating work collegues/friends? This one I'm interested in. I've developed feelings in the past for women in my friend group but was always to scared to make a move in case things didn't work out and got awkward. Is this a resonable take?
5. Advice on cold approaching women? I think this would be hardest for me, as I really do struggle to know when a women is flirting or just being nice. I've been caught out by this in the past.
6. Is it worth going on a date with someone if I know they're interested in me? I hate the idea of leading someone on then dissapointing them, maybe because thats happened to me a few times...
7. I have a few girl friends, as well as sisters, so I'm not completely in the dark when it comes to women. But any other general advice for essentially a noob when it comes to women and dating would be appriciated!

My name is María Sawyer, or at least that was my name until recently.

I still remember every detail of what happened that night, even though I wish I didn’t.

It all started that night. I was coming back from a party at my friend Emily’s house.                              I’m sure it was past eleven.

I remember driving down the old road that cuts through part of the forest, the one that winds between dark pines and always smells like wet earth.

The rain was pouring down, hammering the windshield of my 2003 Fiat as if someone were throwing rocks from the sky. 
It felt like the heavens might collapse at any moment.

The windshield wipers squeaked with every swipe, barely clearing enough water for me to see the cracked asphalt.

The car’s headlights were practically useless in that storm
—half- dead, they only lit up a meter ahead. I was going about thirty miles an hour, gripping the steering wheel so tightly to keep control that my knuckles ached.

Suddenly, through the fog and the curtain of rain, a figure appeared out of nowhere from between the trees.

He was staggering right in the middle of the road, as if he couldn’t see or hear anything.

He wore a soaked black leather jacket, his silhouette stark against the gray of the road. 

I let out a choked scream.

I swear I slammed the brakes as hard and fast as I could.

The car skidded, the tires screeched against the slick asphalt, and the seatbelt dug into my chest—all in a fraction of a second.

But despite my efforts, I couldn’t stop completely.
I hit him.

It wasn’t a hard impact
—the front bumper barely grazed his leg—
but he fell to the ground with a dull thud, like a sack of potatoes tossed from a truck.

I jumped out of the car without thinking, my heart pounding in my ears.

The rain soaked me in seconds, plastering my hair to my face and seeping into my sneakers.

“Hey! Are you okay? I swear I didn’t mean to!”

 I yelled, running toward him.

The man was lying face down, letting out low groans, like a dying dog.

He was big —bigger than he’d seemed from inside the car.

I grabbed his arm to help him roll over, and his full weight slumped against me, like a corpse.

When he turned, he looked straight into my eyes, and I felt an immediate chill.

His eyes were brown, devoid of any emotion, sunken in deep dark circles, and they didn’t blink even with the rain pelting his face.

He had an unkempt beard caked with mud, and a thin scar ran across his left eyebrow, barely visible in the glow of my headlights.


“Relax, little one, it’s fine. I think I’m… okay.”            he said.


His voice was deep, raspy, like he’d smoked a pack of cigarettes and hadn’t slept in weeks.

A shiver ran through me—I wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or from him—but I couldn’t leave him there. 
After all, it was my fault, and the nearest town was miles away. 
I didn’t know if the impact had hurt him more than it seemed.

“Come on, get in the car. I’ll take you to a hospital to get checked out.” 

I said, gesturing clumsily toward the car, still overwhelmed by the accident I’d just caused.

The man stood up slowly without saying much, bracing himself on the ground with large, rough hands covered in scars that looked like poorly healed cuts.

He limped a little as he walked, but not as much as I’d expected for someone I’d just hit.

He climbed into the back seat without another word, leaving a puddle of dirty water on the worn upholstery. 

If I hadn’t caused this whole mess, I’d have been annoyed about the state of my car’s interior.

I got back behind the wheel, trembling, and started the engine.  

The motor coughed before rumbling to life, and the sound of rain on the roof filled the silence.

Inside the car, the air felt thick and stale.

He smelled awful
—urine, stale tobacco, old sweat, and a metallic tang that set my nerves on edge, like he’d been near blood recently.—

Maybe he was just a drifter who’d had bad luck, I told myself, trying to calm my nerves. But his demeanor made that impossible.

His fingers tapped an odd rhythm, like he was following a song only he could hear.

I tried to talk, hoping to steady myself.

“What’s your name?” 

I asked, glancing at his blurry profile in the fogged-up rearview mirror.

“I don’t think that really matters.”

 he replied curtly, without turning his head.
I kept staring out the fogged window; the rain traced crooked lines on the glass.  

His fingers kept moving, restless, like they wanted to grab something.

The nearest hospital was half an hour away, and I was a mess: jeans clinging to my legs, soaked sneakers dripping water, hair dripping into my eyes.  

I decided to stop by my house first, ten minutes away, to change quickly.

“I’m… I’m going to stop for a second to change. Wait here, it won’t take long.” 

I said as I parked in front of my porch. But he didn’t react.

The house was small, old wood with peeling paint that glistened in the rain.  

But as soon as I stepped out of the car, he muttered something I couldn’t make out

—a guttural sound that I didn’t like one bit.—

Maybe he thought I was running off?

I dashed to the door and went inside, leaving a trail of water on the linoleum floor.

Inside, the radiator’s warmth hit my face.  

I kicked off my soaked sneakers, grabbed dry clothes in under five minutes

the cold and damp were already seeping into my bones.  

I wasn’t gone long, but when I stepped back onto the porch with new shoes on and a hoodie under my arm, the car was empty.

The back door was open, banging against the frame in the icy wind.  

I looked around and saw muddy boot prints climbing the wooden steps to my door.

My stomach twisted so hard I nearly threw up.

 I’d been an idiot.

—most likely, this was all a trick to rob some naive fool, and I was the poor sucker who’d fallen for it so easily.—

I stepped back inside slowly, the creak of the floorboards the only sound.  

The living room light was on—I could’ve sworn I’d left it off.

And there he was, motionless, standing in the middle of the room, staring at a photo of me on the wall.  

It was one of those silly beach pictures.
—me with a huge smile, hair tousled by the wind, next to my friend Emily. —

The lightbulb cast a glow on his face, and a deep chill ran through me. 

I finally saw him clearly—his disgusting features: a crooked nose, like it’d been broken more than once; greasy skin that shone with sweat; that scar on his eyebrow that seemed to shift when he frowned.

“What… what do you think you’re doing?” 

I said, trying to sound firm, but my voice came out as a high-pitched, broken squeak.

He turned slowly, like he had all the time in the world.

“You’re real pretty… you know that?” 

he said, a grotesque smirk twisting his face.  

It wasn’t a normal smile—it was crooked, with yellow teeth and a glint… that macabre glint in his eyes that froze my blood.

His lips barely moved, but that smirk made me take a small step back, bumping into the hallway table.  

An old lamp wobbled and crashed to the floor with a dull thud.

“You’d better get out of here fast, or I’ll call the police!” 

I said, fumbling in the back pocket of my jeans for my phone.  

My fingers were shaking so badly I could hardly grip it.

But he took a step toward me, limping less than I remembered.

“You really think it’s that easy?” 

he murmured, his voice low and almost amused, making my skin crawl.

I tried to bolt from the room, but he lunged at me, going straight for my phone.  

We struggled.  

His hands were cold, heavy—he grabbed my arm with a force that tore a scream from me.  

The phone slipped from my grip, bounced on the carpet, and slid under the couch.  

I tried to break free, kicking and scratching, but it was like fighting a wall

—he didn’t even flinch.
He shoved me against the wall, and a picture frame—
a cheap landscape I’d bought at a flea market—crashed to the floor, shattering the glass.  

His rancid breath hit my face, stinking of tobacco and something rotten.  

His eyes were too close
—those brown eyes looked almost black, like a pit—

and I saw my reflection in them: small, terrified, trapped with a predator.

I swung at his face, but he grabbed my wrist—his hands icy cold. A shiver shot through my chest, like something alive was wriggling inside me.  

He twisted my wrist until I whimpered in pain.

“Stop it, it’s useless to fight, Mary.” 

he growled, shoving me hard enough to drop me to my knees.

Somehow, he knew my name. But before I could even react, everything blurred.

I don’t know if I hit my head or if it was something else, but the world went dark and fuzzy. 

My body felt heavy, like I was sinking into dirty water.  

I felt a sharp, painful tug—not physical, but deeper, like I was being ripped from my own skin. It was like falling into a deep, dark well.

When I opened my eyes, I was sprawled on the floor, my face pressed into the carpet that smelled of dust and old coffee.  

I tried to get up, but I noticed it right away—something was wrong.

My hands… I looked at my hands as fast as I could. They weren’t mine—not how I remembered them.

They were big, rough, with dirty nails and scars that looked like they’d been carved with a dull knife.

I tried to pull myself together, but something itched on my face. 

I touched it—unkempt beard, greasy skin, like someone had smeared lard on it. My breath reeked of stale tobacco and that metallic tang.  
My legs shook with dread—

I looked down, but they weren’t mine; they were heavy, clumsy, like they carried an extra weight I didn’t understand.

I stumbled to the bathroom, tripping over the broken picture frame, and looked in the sink mirror. I screamed.

It was him.

The guy from the road.  

Crooked nose, brown eyes, that damn scar on his eyebrow.  

My reflection stared back with a look I didn’t recognize.

I staggered back to the living room, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute in this chest that wasn’t mine.  

And there was my body—my wet brown hair, my blue hoodie, my worn jeans—sitting on the couch, watching me with a calm that made me sick.


He stood up slowly and, in my voice, said in a grim tone, 

“You’d better get used to it, sweetheart.”

He smiled with my mouth—a twisted smirk that wasn’t my smile; it was the crooked grimace I’d seen on him before.  

He grabbed my jacket from the coat rack, slipped it on casually, and walked out the door without looking back.

The sound of his steps—my steps—faded into the rain.

I ran after him, or tried to.  

This body was slow, awkward, and my heavy boots slipped on the wet floor.  

I screamed, but my voice came out as a hoarse growl—a sound that didn’t form words, just noise.
  
I stood on the porch, watching my car roar to life and disappear down the road, its taillights swallowed by the fog.

Now I’m here, sitting in my living room, trying to write down what’s happened, staring at these hands that aren’t mine.  

The clock on the wall says 3 a.m., and the silence is crushing me.  

This body feels like lead, and every breath brings a dull ache in my ribs, like I’d run a marathon.

I try to stay calm while I process everything, but his memories start creeping in, like leaks in an old house: a woman screaming in an alley, her nails scraping the pavement; the sound of a knife scraping bone, slow and deliberate; a low laugh that turns my stomach and makes me clench my fists.

I swear I tried to get help—I banged on the neighbor’s door, old Al , across the street—but he saw me through the window, freaked out, and shut the curtains like he’d seen a ghost.

An hour ago, I heard sirens in the distance.
I turned on the old kitchen radio, and through the static, a voice came through:  

—“Last sighting of suspect María Sawyer, brown hair, blue hoodie, driving a 2003 Fiat. She was seen entering an abandoned house with Emily Jones. The woman is armed and dangerous. Call 911 immediately if you see her.”—


I know it was him, in my body, out there like nothing happened—and he was with Emily.

I tried to yell her name, but this body only growled, and my hands—his hands—clenched into fists on their own.

I really hope she’s okay, or that God has mercy and she can escape that imposter.

I’d try to worry more about her, but I’ve got my own problem here.

The police are out there looking for me, but they don’t know the real problem is here, trapped in this skin I can’t control.

I feel a tingling in my fingers, an urge I don’t understand.  

I look at the kitchen knife left on the table from the struggle, and these hands tremble, like they want to grab it. 

It feels like a primal instinct in this body.
I don’t know how much time I have left before this body does something insane.  

Or before he, in my skin, stains my name with something I can’t erase.

But just thinking about it… I feel a twisted smirk forming slowly on his—on my—lips, and a low chuckle—his laugh—slips from my throat.

I just… I just need… I need to go for a walk.

Print details: I used food grade PETG(cheapest one I could find, that's also the reason it's yellow, it was slightly cheaper) and stainless steel nozzle(brass nozzles can leak some harmful metals). It's 51mm so I can use 16grams of coffee(original basket is 24gr) with my gaggia classic pro. Until now, I could only dial it in but one thing I can say is, some of espressos had no business being that good with those parameters. For example my first shot run for 18s and had something like 1/2 ratio but it was still quite pleasant. Anyways just wanted to put the idea here and maybe we can discuss improvements.

Which ended up being a twofer, cuz I used some brown sugar that had been in my cupboard for like a year. Turned out more like a black sludge than caramel in color, but tasted legit. Put it on some ice cream for dessert (yes, the only ice cream I had was a Reese Klondike bar, and no, I did not wait for the sauce to thicken at that point 🤪.) Then this morning I mixed some into a homemade ""fancy"" iced coffee for myself, better than Starbucks, cuz it was FREE!

1jndwi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghibli/comments/1jndwi7/new_fan/,New fan,"Ever since my daughter was born, I have been patiently waiting and last night finally introduced her to ghibli with My Neighbor Totoro. She was transfixed—she started watching while standing up at the coffee table, and I had to physically move her to the couch haha. And usually when she watches tv she’s quiet, but with this she expressed so much emotion: a little fear, a little sadness, huge guffaws and screams. She loved it and wanted to watch it again when it ended.

I should say, I don’t need my daughter to share my interests, but as someone who first saw Totoro in my 20’s my first impression was that it was a kids’ movie that was made with such a deep understanding of the psychology and emotional landscape of being that age (4+). In other words, it truly felt made for them. So, I was curious to see how someone that age actually experienced it, and it was truly a joyful night. I should add though that (even knowing the end) the search for Mei hits different after having kids!

Plus, grandma was also watching (her first ghibli too). She’s into painting and she was very impressed by the artistry.

Anyway, I say all this because my fam doesn’t know or love ghibli like I do and I thought I’d reach out to you all just to share the love and gratitude I have for these amazing gifts ❤️ ",8,1743345736.0,ghibli,1,0.91,False

It is in the stolen glances across a crowded room, the warmth of a hand intertwined with another, and the quiet comfort of knowing someone is always there.

True love is not found in grand gestures alone but in the little things-the way one person remembers how the other takes their coffee, the way they pull a blanket over them when they fall asleep, or how they listen to their dreams as if they were their own. It is in laughter that echoes through late-night conversations and the unspoken words that rest in the spaces between breaths.

Love is patient, enduring through storms and standing resilient against the winds of change. It is not perfect, but it does not need to be. It thrives in imperfections, in learning, in growing together. It is the courage to be vulnerable, to let someone see the depths of your soul, and to trust that they will cherish it.

From Monday to Thursday, I start my day by checking my phone, washing the dishes, sweeping the yard, and making coffee. After a quick break, I take a bath, eat breakfast, and get ready for school.

So my family brought a rishta for me one year ago, I was actively looking for partner in AM route at that time so I agreed to meet her and her family. So after our meet her family didn't say anything so i wasn't sure if they want to proceed or not. She used to work in same tech park as me(not in same company) so I asked her at that time 2/3 times if she wanted to go grab some coffee near our office (mind you i didn't ask her out on a date just 10/15 mins break so we can talk that's it). So rejected those as well, so I backed off thought she didn't want to proceed. So after few days I so she joined matrimonial app, it showed joined recently so it solidified my thought that she rejected and I moved on for good. So time went almost a year passed now I am not in same mindspace like a year ago and I'm not looking to marry nor I'm looking for any rishtas to be honest. But today her family called my family asked she want their daughter to marry on 2026 if I am available they want us to proceed. Now as I said before I'm not in right headspace and she kindof rejected me a year before so i naturally said no, so now her mom is asking me to talk to her daughter to which I said no as well as there is nothing to tell. 

My family is kindof trying to manipulate me to talk to her and told no to them. Am I being the A-hole here?

Regarding the DOUE for 1, what are the limitations for ordering? Is this like the Cheers package? I know with alcoholic drinks, you have to wait 5 mins in between order, but how about specialty coffees? Can he order two drinks, say latte, at the same time? Does the same go with sodas, juices, etc?

I have the DOU in casino while actively playing, but this is our first time using the DOUE for 1. Any tips will be appreciated. TIA",4,1743344397.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,7,0.67,False
1jndelg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jndelg/screeches_roars_and_fire_part_ii_the_coward/,"Screeches, Roars and fire part II: The Coward","""Fire. Flames were devouring everything and everyone in their way. Flames that were born from the old tree.
All I could do was to watch. Watch'em all burn.
Everything we've built.
Houses. Businesses. Relationships. Families. All up on fire. Burning to their core. The smell. Burnt flesh and burnt wood. It smelled good...

But it wasn't just the fire...no...

Rats. It was their third wave of attack this week. They ran through the fire , careless of burning. Careless of each other. They were all driven mad. They were hungry. And the tree, the tree just gave them a cooked meal.

We were fighting. Trying. Trying to do something. Anything. But ultimately, we had to flee. While running away. I saw one of us.
Standing in the flames. Careless like the rodents.
He was standing tall above it all. As if the fire was beneath him. As if it didn't have any right to touch him. He was still fighting. Cutting them. Slicing them. Shooting them. But they were still coming. He didn't even look tired.
We rode away. We were stranded for days. No food no clean water...""


"" What kind of hunter are ye? If you can't even hunt to survive."" The innkeeper asked impatiently.

"" I was talking... don't interrupt me. Please.""

"" You can't even kill a couple of pesky rats. Don't threaten me. I don't have time for your sob story. Feck off.""

"" You know, I was going to beg you for some supplies. for mercy , for kindness. But now, now I think we're just going to take it.""

"" Off of my dead body ye bastard!""

"" Exactly...""

I pulled out my knife and rushed him. pulled and tugged at his legs and fell on top of him. Slashed his throat clean. I watched as life itself flew out of his body.
Tears were forming underneath his eyes.
The boy just bled out. And I just sat there and forcefully listened to his gurgles. He was inexperienced. I overreacted. Something took over me...it wasn't anger. Petty. Yes , I felt petty for him. For us.
Others joined inside. Looting everything they could get their grasp on. Eventually I got off of the dead boy still looking inside his eyes. Empty. Nothing behind them anymore. All because of me. Went outside crying. Because I know. I know that now, we are the rats...



"" Hey you ok?"" Shamus checked on me.

I didn't know what to respond with. Lost for words. What have I done?
What have I become?

"" Yeah , I'm fine.Get as much as possible. We don't have much time, we need to leave.""

"" Why didn't you just shoot the bastard?""

"" We'll need the ammo. And shooting him would have resulted in gathering unnecessary attention.""

"" What kind of an idiot leaves a boy in charge of an inn in the middle of nowhere...""

"" An idiot. C'mon hurry up.""

"" Hehe , you got it.""

I took out a match , and lit it.
Stared at it for a couple of seconds. Admired it.
Beautiful. So deadly, yet so delicate.
I miss home. I miss my wife. I miss seeing her every morning. A part of me really believed it this time. I keep lying to people again and again...
I'm so sick of it. Why? Do they even Care? No one buys it... everyone knows what I truly am...
A coward. I'm a fraud who got away. Didn't even try. To save them. To fight the rodents. To put out the massive flames. To save her...
If it weren't for these idiots, I'd be dead.
Been running with these Irish folk for a while now.
A lot of them have died either in pointless shootouts or they've died to the plague.
Ironically, that's what they call themselves. The plague.
There aren't a lot of us left. Only four of us now. Last week ,  we were 8. This world is succumbing us to its cruelty one by one.
 we deserve it...
Spreading havoc everywhere we go.
I've done a lot of things to prove that I'm worth keeping around. Proved my loyalty. It had its price. If she were to see me right now , she'd spit in my face and shoot me. Probably...
The fire was getting really close to my finger tips. I had to put it out. 
Protection is a hard thing to come by out in the wilds. Back in the village I never truly appreciated what I had. Not until I lost it.


"" C'mon boy, get your arse moving."" 

Nolan was our leader. Our visionary...
Can't lie , when I first met him I saw right through him. He hides his narcissism with his charisma. He has lost, a lot. Friends, family and foes alike. Rivals. Tons of rivals. Tons of enemies.
Enemies that won't give up until they would have his head. He means well for his people.
He truly does. Seen it with my own two eyes.
How much he cried when he lost the love of his life. How much sorrow he carried when he lost his right hand man. When he lost his brothers.
We have buried so many people in these parts.
The woods are filled with the ghosts of his people.
He keeps promising us. Over promising. A better future. Someplace where we can feel safe. Be free. Be happy. To do whatever we want. A fresh start. I'd love to believe him. But that's impossible. A place like that would be heaven and I've lost my faith.
Therefore, I don't really like him.

The only person among these fools I like is O'Connor. He has a brain. And most importantly, the kid has heart. I admire that about him.

"" Ye did good today. Keep it up.""

"" Thanks Nolan.""

"" You know when I first met ya , I wanted to shoot ye. There is no way In hell, I let a Scottish bastard join us...I said. But I'm glad I did. I'm starting to really like ya.""

"" Same here. Thank you.""

Bastard.


We rode away and camped in the woods.

We set our tents and sat by the fire, except for O'Connor. He was journaling as usual. 
I watched them feast on the food we took. I could barely eat. Each time I thought of it , the face of that boy would come to my mind.
I could hear screams. Faintly. Roars. Nolan got up and picked up his rifle, and without telling us anything he ran towards the screams. He didn't give us any time to react. His second in command by order, shamus ran after him. Soon after, me and O'Connor followed them.
Bang!. Bang!. Bang!.

The screams were getting worse and worse.
As if , Nolan ran out there not to  save the poor bastards, but to make their pain worse.

Heart pumping fast. Eventually we found him.
He was starstruck at the sight of what he had stumbled upon. A priest and his disciples, torn apart. And standing alongside their pieces... Was a beast.
 Blood gushing out of its mouth.
It's nails sharp and some were broken. It's fur darker than the night's sky...
With teeth the size of a finger , it attacked us.
I stood back and shot at it from afar.
It wasn't enough. It slashed and jumped. And eventually it stabbed its teeth into shamus. He screamed with fear. No matter how many hits it received , it was nothing!.
It brought shamus to his knees. As it tried to go for the second bite, I saw O'Connor jump on the beast's back and pierce through its fur with a cross. Made of silver.
It roared , of pain. O'Connor didn't stop. Stab after stab. The poor boy was getting soaked in its blood. Eventually it had enough. It took O'Connor by the collar of his shirt and threw him onto a nearby tree.
I found a crucifix on the ground next to the torn pages of the book of god.
Nolan grabbed Shamus and carried him away.
As away as he possibly could but the beast was much faster. It could outrun all of us normally and Nolan had shamus on his shoulder. He didn't let go of him. He could, to insure his own safety, but he didn't.
The look in his eyes wasn't of fear...but acceptance. He had tried. That's what mattered. I couldn't let them die. 
I didn't want to die a coward...
I emptied the rest of my ammo grabbing its attention. As it ran towards me , I could see her.
The life I had with her. The best time of my life.
Everything that I've done in life, good or bad...
Had let me here. In front of this magnificent creature. I squeezed the crucifix in my hand, hard. Its spit, making a river under its feet.
It opened its mouth and put its tongue out. Licking Its lips. I gazed into the eyes of my possible killer and saw a man. The eyes of a man. Just like that boy. They looked so innocent and pure. Pain. Agony. Torment.
It had gone through all of it.
Rotten blood under its nails. All of a sudden, it was ready to strike. Ready to take a bite of its dinner. I held the crucifix up. It went inside its mouth. The crucifix had a sharp edge underneath. I stabbed its mouth open.
It couldn't close it. The silver was driving it , driving him mad. It started to cry out like a lost pup. Limped on the ground, shaking aggressively.

"" PLEASE...KILL ME!!!""

He talked... Through the beast.

Begged for the sweet release. For mercy. For his curse to end.

Nolan walked up to him. Looking down on him. He felt bad. He took out his revolver and , shot him in the head. The silver had weakened him enough that the bullet went through. He was free. O'Connor went into a mad laugh. Laughing and then crying.

"" Why? WHY DID YOU RUN OFF? ANSWER ME!""

I yelled.

"" To scavenge..."" He replied.

Beaten and tired , we limped back to our tents.

"" Boy be careful please. Every piece of my hair hurts!."" Shamus let out in pain.

"" Don't worry let's get you patched up.""

O'Connor tended to Shamus's wounds.

He was burning with a horrible fever.

"" I meant to ask you of this land...is there any tale behind it?"" Nolan asked like a child in a classroom.

"" Ayy. There is.""

"" Would you mind telling it to me?""

"" Why do you care?""

"" I need to know what and why we are fighting...""

"" (Sigh) There are many reasons as to why things are the way they are...but  mostly, people tend to believe that we are suffering because of our sins. God showed us mercy but we were blind to it. And now, he's showing us his wrath to open our eyes.""

""People? Don't you believe it?""

""Not any more, no.""

"" So you're saying God cursed ye?""

"" You'll be hanged if you say that to a priest...
I believe so. God was never merciful. All this death over a pitiful grudge. it will pass...they said.""

"" You tend to not respect the lord...""

"" Respect? No for that I have plenty for him...
I don't worship him anymore. It never did any good for me.""

"" How long does it last?""

"" We are not even in the middle of it. Usually it will take half a year. But sometimes. Sometimes it will last a whole damn year.""

"" No , I meant the entirety of the curse...""

"" Like I said until we open our eyes to his mercy.""

"" You don't have to worry... I'll get us out. We'll leave.""

"" You crazy? We can't just leave the land. Once the plague starts, filth and beasts alike roam around the line that separates us. And even if we were to get passed them , where do we go?
The presbyteral counsil will come after us.""

"" We'll go somewhere, where no one can tell us what to do... The land of the free.""

"" You have truly lost your mind.""

"" I know a captain...he is a close friend of mine and he has been smuggling people out of the country for a while now... That will be our only chance.""

""I don't think if that's a good idea.""

"" Listen, I know it's a lot to ask of ye. Today you once again proven that you are family.
I need you to be alongside me.""

""I have no one else here. Nowhere else to be.
Whatever you decide is best for us. I'll follow. But , I'm not sure about this. It's very risky.""

"" More risky than being hunted by beasts?""

"" Ayy. The council of priests aren't exactly too forgiving on people who run from their punishment. They aren't... normal.""

"" You don't worry about them. We'll be alright. I promise you that. Sleep tight ey.""

"" Goodnight.""


I could hear shamus moan in pain all night.
I dreamt of her. Her beauty. Her body. I miss her. She went to the old tree to visit her grandmother one last time. The tree caught on fire. Can she have made it?

I took the crucifix with me. I slained a beast today. Who would have imagined. Would she be proud? Would she care? 
Yeah , I think she would have.

Sleep never came. Only thoughts did. All kinds of thoughts.
O'Connor was still awake. Sketching something. I got up and that startled him.

"" Can't sleep either ey?"" He said.

""Yeah. What're you doing?""

"" Drawing.""

"" Can I see?""

"" Sure.""

He was drawing a man. Smiling with teary eyes.
A man who was happy. To live. To exist. Something like that is fictional now.

"" It's the man, he was. Before he lost his humanity.""

"" It's beautiful. Great work.""

"" I thought maybe, in this way I can pay a little tribute.""

I nodded 

"" I didn't take you for a religious figure."" I said while sitting by the fire making some coffee.

"" I'm not, the cross was my father's.""

"" I'm sorry for your loss. He raised a good son.""

"" Don't be, but thanks. He was nothing but a drunken bastard.""

"" If you ever wanted to talk about it. I'll listen.""

""  thank you.""

"" Then why do you carry around his cross?""

"" A trophy. It was him or me mom.
The bastard's cross finally had a use tonight.""

"" I guess we all have skeletons in our closets then.""

""Ayy.""

"" How did you end up here anyways?""

"" Our local priest, Crazy fecker. He called my mom a witch. Put a trial for her and everything.
They forced me to attend. To...
They gave me torches. The look of betrayal and despair in her eyes...I couldn't bring myself to...
I...ran away. there were searching parties for me. They called me a heretic. I embarked on a ship one night. I probably had to much to drink.
Didn't know it was going to sail here. There I found Nolan. He is the brightest person I've ever met. He hid me from them. He kept me safe. And all I had to do in return, was to accompany him. And here we are...""

"" I'm so sorry. I don't know what the future holds for us...but whatever it is , I hope we can make it out."" I responded.

I passed him a cup of coffee. We sipped and chatted a little bit longer and before we knew it, it was dawn. The horrible noises didn't stop.
After some while , it will become normal. Like birds singing. I hated that. The normality of it.

Shamus had stopped moaning. Probably passed out due to intense pain.

I heard a familiar noise. Not that far from us. A noise that destroyed my village. Squeaks. They were here.
I woke Nolan. Told him about our situation and what will happen if we don't leave immediately.
We packed fast. And rode away. Shamus and I rode together. He could barely sit still. His eyes kept on shutting. He looked really pale.

"" We need to bring him to a doctor!"" I shouted 

""We can't, the moment we step foot into a town they'll kill us."" Nolan explained 

"" What do we do then?""

"" Just follow me! I know a place we can go.""

We rode fast. Their squeaks were fading. For once we were faster. After hours of being on horseback we eventually reached the line.
 The beach.
Weirdly enough , there were no beasts. Or filth. Was it all lies? Lies to keep us here? Why?
 What would they gain from keeping us and slowly killing us?
It was beautiful.
Peaceful.


"" There he is!"" Nolan yelled and pointed to a sailboat on the shore.

"" Did you plan this out? Or is this just dumb luck?""

"" Love to say it's luck, but no. I've been writing letters to the captain for a month now...
I told you, don't worry. We made it!""

We didn't have anytime to celebrate...
Shamus fell from my horse. He fell on the sand convulsing. Spit coming out of his mouth and then blood. His bones were all breaking...

"" HE IS TURNING!!!""

Nolan took out his revolver and shot his former comrade with remorse in his eyes. It was too late. To no effect.

Shamus's mouth turned inside out! His skin was getting covered in fur! His limbs were growing! His nails growing to a size of an infant longer than the beast prior. clothes tearing. Screeches turned into Roars. Tears leaving his eyes. The last essence of humanity left him.
He was now , a monster. It attacked us with a different kind of force.


"" DON'T LET HIM BITE YOU!"" I yelled.

"" ATTACK IT WITH SILVER!""
Someone aboard the ship shouted.

The crucifix...It wasn't with me... In the panic of the rats attacking, I'd forgotten the crucifix...
O'Connor still had the cross.

It roared an ear piercing noise. It brought me to my knees. O'Connor had dropped the cross in the sand. Our ears were bleeding. I slowly crawled my way towards the silver.
It was hopeless.

Eventually it stopped. I got up holding the cross like a believer. It looked at us with curiosity. Breathing loudly. As if breathing was painful for it.

"" You bastard killed shamus!"" Nolan said.

I realized there was no way we were all going to make it...

"" Take O'Connor and run for the boat! I'll buy you time."" Said by the coward.

"" It will tear you apart! What are you talking about?""

"" I'm dead anyways. I'm inflicted with the plague ."" I lied "" Please go. Don't make it be for nothing...""

"" We can fight together I won't leave you!""

"" You must  save the kid!""

The beast was done pandering... It was getting hungry.

Nolan took O'Connor and ran for it and yelled for the captain to start sailing.

The beast wanted them. I shot at it. Again and again. Made it really angry. 
They got onboard.

Now it was me and the remainder of Shamus left. 
Once again I saw her. But this time...it wasn't just her , my newly established comrades were there as well. The day they found me shivering in a cave. Offering me a helping hand instead of robbing and killing me. Once again I didn't know what I had until I lost it.
It attacked with anger and fear in its core.
Its warm comfortable fur tossed me in the water like I was nothing. It got on top of me. I was prepared to see her. But without even knowing it I had impaled the beast with his cross.
O'Connor Mccaghy had saved me once again.
Just like the time he held my hand in the cave.
But it wasn't enough. It was crying. Like a child.
Its tears caressed my face. 
Tears turned into blood. Before I knew it. The beast's head was sliced open by a battle axe.
Standing behind it , was her grandfather .
The man who stood in the fire above it all. The definition of courage.

"" Been looking for you everywhere son! 
You're a hard man to find..."" 
He laughed with a nasty cough.
