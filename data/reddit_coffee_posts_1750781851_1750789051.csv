1ljiizx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ljiizx/atah_for_blowing_up_on_my_friend_who_wouldnt_stop/,ATAH for blowing up on my friend who wouldn't stop pestering me,"My friend Francine, who is 32 years old, has been driving me absolutely insane lately with her increasingly erratic behavior and what feels like a relentless obsession with my life. 

It‚Äôs as if she feels the need to know every tiny detail about my daily existence my thoughts, my actions, every breath I take. 

We‚Äôre talking about a barrage of texts flooding my phone at all hours, asking questions like ‚ÄúWhat are you doing right now?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho are you with?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat did he/she say?!‚Äù etc. 

At first, I tried to shrug it off as a sign of her interest in my life, but it‚Äôs morphed into a full-blown interrogation. 

This prying attitude has been building for months, and to be honest, I‚Äôm feeling suffocated by it.

I understand that Francine claims her obsessive need to know stems from her OCD and she insists that understanding my activities provides her with a sense of security. 

I can empathize with her struggles and truly can. 

However, at what point does my own mental well-being take precedence over her need for information?

I‚Äôve made attempts to set boundaries, approaching the conversation gently while explaining that I require some personal space. 

But instead of respecting my wishes, she just finds new ways to worm her way back into my life. It has become exhausting and frustrating.

The final straw happened just yesterday when I casually mentioned that I was meeting up with an ex for coffee a totally platonic get-together after years apart.

In this very moment I brought it up, Francine erupted into a virtual frenzy, bombarding my phone for hours with a stream of questions demanding to know every single detail. 

Where did we go? What did we talk about? 

What was he wearing? 

Did he look at me ""that way""?

 It felt utterly overwhelming and invasive and after hours of constant pressure, I finally reached my breaking point. 

I shot her a text that read, ""Francine, you are being incredibly nosy and intrusive. Your OCD is not an excuse to pry into every aspect of my life. I need you to stop. Right now. Consider this a major boundary. If you can't respect it, then we‚Äôre done."" 

That message set off a complete meltdown on her end and she called me sobbing, accusing me of being insensitive, arguing that I don‚Äôt understand her struggles, and claiming that all she wants to do is support me.

Yet, on the other hand, it felt like a form of emotional manipulation, as if she was more concerned about her own feelings than respecting my boundaries.

Now, I‚Äôm left wondering: Am I the asshole for finally laying down the law with Francine? 

There‚Äôs a part of me that feels guilty because I know she‚Äôs battling her own issues, but I also firmly believe that I‚Äôm entitled to some privacy and respect in my friendships.",1,1750788793.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Generally it's been going well. She is very nice, we're fairly compatible (maybe a little too similar at that). Great sexual chemistry as well. The biggest hang up for me is the ""paying for stuff"" thing - in my past relationships I mostly split or take turns paying for things, but I would pay for smaller meals, coffees, that type of thing.

I paid for the first date at a cafe. She invited me to a boardgame cafe for a second date, and she paid the entrance for me which I appreciated. So far so good. Third date we went to a restaurant for dinner. She noticed I was being a little slow with getting my card out and remarked that it was our first time eating together (technically... but I did pay for the first date) and we ended up splitting.

A week or two later we somehow got on the topic of ranting to friends, and I asked her if she's ever complained about me. She told me that she complained to her cousins that she's not used to going dutch/splitting for meals and other expenses. I took a bit of offense to this as I had started paying for desserts, coffees, etc. outside of main meals and I explained to her that I wasn't comfortable paying for everything in a relationship. She seemed alright with it.

It came up again more recently when we were discussing traditional gender norms and she was remarking for me not to expect that from her (the being in the kitchen/doing all household chores, etc.). Wasn't totally serious but I explained to her I don't expect that, I grew up in a household where my parents split all household duties, and my dad is actually the one who cooks.

The paying for things thing was still in the back of my mind so I brought it up¬†*again*, and told her that I feel that there is some inconsistency in saying you don't follow the ""bad"" gender norms but you want to keep the good ones (being paid for). She brought up some stuff about how men make more than women, and how women have to pay more for beauty products. I did end up asking her how much she makes and she actually makes more than me. Her living situation is a little different so her costs are higher, but for all intents and purposes we make the same amount if you take that into account.

This was still bothering me the next day so I talked to her again and I explained that the part that bothers me is not the money, but the equality aspect of a relationship. I have the unfortunate experience of seeing (and being in) a bunch of toxic relationships where there is a ""winner"" and a ""loser"" - I don't ever want to be either one. I see the whole paying for/treating for things (other than special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) as a symptom of one party putting more into the relationship and that inevitably leads to resentment. She acknowledged my concerns and said she understood where I was coming from.

But long story short, I have been paying for the majority of things since then. I've paid for probably 75% of meals/extras/etc. She paid for one meal because I literally couldn't - someone stole my card and the place did not take contactless. I even offered to send her my share afterwards but she was resistant to it. Oh, and she paid for a $15 Uber. The last two meals she literally pushed the check towards to me, there was no discussion of splitting. I wanted to say something at the last place (last night, the impetus for this post) but the waitress was at the side of the table with the Clover contactless payment thing and I didn't want to make a scene. I am taking her out for her birthday and she gave me suggestions of places that will cost me $200+. I don't mind treating her to a fancy meal for her birthday but I feel like she should be more conscientious about paying her share for other meals given that.

Am I off-base here? I have a pretty big chip on my shoulder about the splitting thing, and I have talked to her about it multiple times, I explained exactly why it rubs me the wrong way. I feel like the usual advice on here is to communicate, to use your words. And I have, several times. Either she thinks I'm not being serious about it, or she doesn't care.

I guess it might seem like a small thing given that otherwise we are very compatible, she is generally very nice. But it¬†*really*¬†really bothers me to the point I'm wondering if it's something that is worth breaking up over. If she doesn't respect my views over this, what are the chances that she'll have the same mindset for something even more important?

tl;dr: Girlfriend likes being treated, I explained to her why I don't do it (besides smaller stuff like coffees, snacks, etc. - and special occasions), she has repeatedly ignored my concerns and literally pushed the check to me to pay when I've communicated why I don't like it.",1,1750788646.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1ljig0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetabolicBoosting/comments/1ljig0v/the_aquasculpt_truth_what_dieters_need_to_know/,The AquaSculpt Truth: What Dieters Need to Know Before Trying This Method,"# üßä I Researched the ""Ice Water Weight Loss Hack"" (AquaSculpt) So You Don't Have To

Hey Reddit! I've been looking into this trending ""AquaSculpt"" weight loss method that claims drinking ice water with supplements can trigger fat burning. Here's what you should know before trying it:

## What Is AquaSculpt?

It's a weight loss approach based on **cold-induced thermogenesis** - essentially, your body burns calories while warming up the ice water you drink. It pairs this with specific supplements and claims to be a simple ""7-second morning protocol.""

## The Science (Simplified)

* When your body faces cold temperatures, it activates thermogenesis to maintain core temperature
* This process uses **brown and beige fat tissues** to create heat through a protein called UCP1
* Your body releases norepinephrine which starts a process converting stored energy directly to heat
* This potentially increases your metabolic rate and helps burn fat

## Key Ingredients

* **Chlorogenic acid** (found in coffee and some fruits) - Claims to decrease fat storage genes and improve glucose processing
* **L-carnitine** - Helps transport fatty acids into cells' mitochondria for energy conversion

## Pros According to Research

* Claims 87% of users reported noticeable fat reduction
* Focuses on natural ingredients rather than stimulants
* Simple daily protocol that's easy to maintain
* May help with weight loss plateaus
* Supports the fact that proper hydration boosts metabolism

## Important Cautions

**Not recommended for people with**:
* Diabetes, heart disease, liver/kidney problems
* Those on medications like insulin, blood pressure meds, blood thinners
* Pregnant/nursing women and teens

## My Take

The simplicity is appealing - just drink ice water with a supplement in the morning. The science behind cold-induced thermogenesis does have some legitimate research backing, but remember that no weight loss method works magic without sensible eating and some activity.

**TL;DR**: AquaSculpt uses cold water and supplements to potentially boost metabolism through thermogenesis. Has some scientific backing but isn't for everyone, especially those with certain health conditions. As with any weight loss approach, maintain realistic expectations.

As any veteran iced capp enjoyer knows, you can dial in the optimal ratio of ice vs liquid in each mouthful by adjusting the height of the straw.

I remember in past summers that when drinking an iced capp in the optimal way, I usually run out of liquid before running out of ice. So normally there is like half an inch of slush at the bottom of the cup after all the coffee is gone. 

But it seems like this year, the iced capps I‚Äôve gotten all had more liquid than ice. It‚Äôs like only the upper quarter of the cup has any ice in it and the bottom 3/4 is all liquid.

**Is Syril a Man? Or a Boy?** 

I want to start here. What I feel we can all agree on. Syril‚Äôs character is emasculated and to an extent, discourse about him continues to emasculate him. Discourse that defends him will present him in terms of self discovery, unknowingly mirroring the \*Identity versus Role Confusion\* stage in Erikson's theory of psychosocial development; a stage that marks someone‚Äôs adolescence. On the opposite end of the argument, ‚ÄúSyril is a fascist‚Äù often has an infantilization ‚ÄúFascist Boy‚Äù. I love Jessie‚Äôs stuff, but take a shot every time she call Syril a boy.¬†

I‚Äôm not saying that infantilizing the character is wrong, the story invites us to do it as we see him eat milk and cereal with a mother neutering his aspirations.¬†

No the infantilizing aspects I feel are subconsciously inviting us to project onto Syril a serious debate in our times. A difficult problem that we don‚Äôt fully understand. And my thesis is that we would all benefit from identifying it and self analyzing it.¬†

**Boys in the Band**

There is a human desire to belong. But one aspect that our culture(s) presents as manly is belonging to a hierarchical, at times abusive, abrasive, and stratified group. The army, the scouts, the sports team. Men grow up routinely being given images idealizing service, power, control. This isn‚Äôt to say that effeminate media doesn‚Äôt. But notice how female protagonists are displayed as arbiters of justice, overthrowing a hierarchy. The mean girls get what they deserve, the cheerleaders become more egalitarian, the woman gains respect. Girls don‚Äôt have a \*Rudy\* or a \*Saving Private Ryan\*, movies where ‚Äúmen‚Äù are allowed to cry. But movies about the camaraderie of belonging to an institution or group.¬†

This is the foundation of Syril‚Äôs defenders. The boy wants to belong, to be of service, and to be recognized for his service. They say that If he had been in the republic, he‚Äôd be a good guy. What gets lost is that this masculine desire to serve makes authoritarianism attractive. Exploitable by fascism. Is he actually a fascist? TLDR at the end.¬†

**teenagers scare the livin' shit out of me**

This is the first of two discussions I fear we are avoiding. Syril Karn isn‚Äôt real. The boy who falls hard for *The Wave* isn‚Äôt real. Hell, the kid in *Adolescence* isn‚Äôt real. ¬†

But what is real is how our society is riddled with boys and men who, like Syril, crave to belong to hierarchy. Whose childish desires for power and control make fascism enticing. Who write endless apologia of sexism, transphobia, and racism. Who are quick to abuse women, who are quick to seek the trappings of power, who are a driving force of the terrors that we are all facing globally.

If the empire is never more alive than when we asleep, then these men find comfort in never waking up. They seek an endless dream; our living nightmare.

That is the wereleopard in this full moon. Syril is a vessel unto which we can pour our discourse about manhood and boyhood.¬†

I don‚Äôt care if Syril Karn can be redeemed. Can the middle school boys I teach and tutor be saved? Can the young men licking the boots be forced to stand up for themselves and grow up?¬†

Tell me, do you have any Syril Karns in your life? Do you think they can be redeemed?

**We Need to Talk About Kevin**

Obviously there is an aspect of Syril that I feel can‚Äôt be glossed over. His violence towards Dedra. The scene is cathartic, not in the Freudian sense of gaining insight, no but that Ancient Greek idea of blood washing away blood. The scene stands on a razor‚Äôs edge between the horrors of violence against a woman being framed as masculinizing. As becoming a man. But I genuinely wonder if the people who preach ‚Äúpunch a Nazi‚Äù draw the line at ‚Äúchoke a bitch?‚Äù¬†

This is a place whereas a man, I feel extremely uncomfortable, and I feel that there is a bigger conversation to be had. We extol violence against fascists and abhor violence against women. What then do we do to fascist women? If Syril had shot her, an act seen less emotional (less sexual), and more rational, would we be all defending him? The scene is clearly about his masculinity, his emancipation. I don‚Äôt have answers, I found the scene horrifying. And want to know something perverse? Given how violence against women is sexualized, what does that say about the fact he doesn‚Äôt choke her to death? That he doesn‚Äôt complete the act.¬†

**Aint no one got time for that**

Sure, you want a ***TLDR***? Fine.¬†I am fulfilling the masculine desire to ramble on Reddit instead of talking to a therapist. Also also,

Question 1"" Is Syril Karn a Fascist? Irrelevant. I genuinely think we are debating this because it‚Äôs much safer and easier than debating the growing tide of fascism in young men. And I while I avoided a whole paragraph on Ian Kershaw‚Äôs quote, ""Trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.‚Äù; I think that the debate of pinning the label ""fascist"" is not productive. Syril seeks to belong to hierarchy that acknowledges how he is a special boy. Fascism exploits that, like it exploits everything. And identifying how one can be both oppressed and still benefit from oppression is a form of maturity that Syril doesn‚Äôt display.

Question 2: What do we do with Fascist Women? What group is more oppressed and oppressor than a woman wielding power in a man‚Äôs world. If we wish to see violence against fascists, how do we rectify that with violence against women. I dont think *Andor* handles this well, and I agree with Jessie on how Syril's death is worse in light of the lack of attention Cinta's death received. And it‚Äôs not just women, the empire thrives in turning marginalized people into cogs in its machinery. Happy pride all you Jung x Hert shippers, you‚Äôve convinced me, I‚Äôm adding Jung to the list of bisexual men in my media who die at the end.¬†

1lji6up,https://i.redd.it/850pbb32zw8f1.jpeg,Pramou is the best platform for Brand-Influencer collaborations.,"Influencer marketing isn‚Äôt just a trend anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs become a cornerstone of modern digital strategy. But let‚Äôs be honest: for most brands, running influencer campaigns still feels chaotic. Endless DMs, scattered spreadsheets, unclear pricing... it‚Äôs anything but efficient.

Enter Pramou‚Äîa platform that‚Äôs not just streamlining the process, but completely transforming how brands and influencers work together.

Let‚Äôs break down exactly how.

üìä Real-Time Analytics That Actually Matter

Most brands launch influencer campaigns hoping for the best‚Äîonly to realize halfway through that they‚Äôre flying blind. Is this influencer actually delivering value? Are people clicking? Is it working?

With Pramou, you don‚Äôt have to guess. You get live, detailed insights right from the moment your campaign begins. The dashboard breaks down what really matters:

How many people your post reached vs. the creator‚Äôs total followers

Engagement rate‚Äîlikes, shares, and comments that actually count

Click-through rates to your website or product page

Conversion metrics that show what‚Äôs driving sales or leads

Real example:
A growing sticker brand partnered with five niche creators through Pramou. Midway through the campaign, they noticed two influencers were outperforming the others in both engagement and click-throughs. Instead of waiting for final reports, they reallocated the budget immediately‚Äîand saw their ROI double by the end of the week.

That‚Äôs the power of data, delivered in real time.

üéØ Find the Right Influencers with AI Precision

Choosing the right influencer isn‚Äôt just about follower count anymore. You need someone who actually connects with your audience‚Äîand finding that perfect fit used to take days of scrolling, vetting, and second-guessing.

Pramou changes the game.
Its AI-powered engine matches brands with creators based on what truly matters:

Audience demographics

Niche alignment

Engagement quality

Location targeting

Example:
A sustainable fashion label used Pramou to find over 20 eco-conscious micro-influencers in just under an hour. What used to take an entire week of research was done over coffee‚Äîno cold DMs, no guesswork.

ü§ù One Dashboard. Total Control.

Ever tried managing 10 influencers using Instagram DMs, Excel sheets, and late-night WhatsApp messages? It‚Äôs chaos.

Pramou brings everything under one roof. You can:

Send detailed campaign briefs

Review and approve content

Manage timelines

Handle payments‚Äîall from a single dashboard

Example:
A D2C startup working on a new launch managed 15 influencers in 7 days without breaking a sweat. By centralizing their workflow with Pramou, they cut their execution time by over 40% and actually had time left to breathe.

üí∞ Transparent Pricing‚ÄîNo Middlemen, No Markups

One of the most frustrating parts of influencer marketing? Pricing that feels like a black box. You‚Äôre never sure who‚Äôs getting what‚Äîor if the value matches the invoice.

Pramou fixes that.

Brands pay only for clear deliverables

Creators receive 100% of their earnings

No hidden agency fees, no shady cuts

Example:
A t-shirt brand avoided ‚Çπ40,000 in agency commissions and reinvested that money to double their influencer reach‚Äîessentially doubling campaign visibility at the same cost.

üîÅ Smarter Campaigns That Learn and Adapt

Influencer marketing shouldn‚Äôt be static. What worked for one campaign might flop in the next‚Äîunless your platform evolves with you.

Pramou gets smarter with every campaign.
Its learning algorithm picks up on what performs best for your brand and adjusts recommendations accordingly.

Example:
An ed-tech company realized regional creators were getting stronger responses. The next time they launched, Pramou prioritized those profiles‚Äîleading to a 25% increase in lead quality.

üí¨ Final Thoughts

Pramou isn‚Äôt just a tool. It‚Äôs an entire ecosystem built for marketers who want control, creators who want fairness, and campaigns that deliver results.

So if you‚Äôre still buried in DMs, spreadsheets, and vague promises‚Äîit‚Äôs time for a better way.

With Pramou, influencer marketing becomes what it should‚Äôve been all along:
üëâ Strategic. Scalable. Smart.

***In today‚Äôs world, attention is currency.
Pramou ensures you spend it where it counts***",1,1750788053.0,influencermarketing,2,1.0,False

This seems to be an issue with both locations but Topos Too is especially bad. Last week I went in and ordered a coffee and the employee looked extremely annoyed, didn't say a word throughout the entire interaction, when she gave me the coffee I said thank you and she just ignored me, turned around immediately and walked away. This isn't a one-time thing either‚ÄîI used to go in somewhat often last year and noticed the very unwelcoming service too.

Tbh I'm not the kind of person who's a Karen about service because I come from a place where people don't usually serve you with a smile or excessive friendliness, but are matter-of-fact, so I keep my expectations low. But honestly the experiences I have at Topos just seem like straight-up poor service? The only exception is there was one employee at Topos Too who was extremely sweet and friendly, but I never see them anymore so I don't know if they're still working. Have others had this experience?

I'm just so tired of these new places opening up that don't even bother to give a shit about service. It feels like they're more concerned with appearing cool than actually running a business. I don't expect a smile or small talk like Trader Joe's or whatever, but the most basic social interaction like a polite ""hi"" or ""thank you"" doesn't seem like too much.",5,1750788033.0,ridgewood,4,0.69,False

Chilean Route 7 is an iconic bikepacking pilgrammage, funneling hundreds of globetrotting cyclists each year into its jagged swan dive towards the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego.

1lji5is,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lji5is/sunsphere_scents_review/,Sunsphere Scents Review,"Sunsphere Scents is Amber Rountree's creation. She is the owner, self-taught perfumer, a Knoxville native, a former librarian, and a researcher at University of Tennessee. The name comes from the golden glass structure that overlooks the city and each fragrance is inspired by Knoxville either through her own memories, historical moments, places, etc. 

The Souvenir Sample pack is 5 sprayers for $25, plus an extra sample of your choosing. There is one size available, 8ml for $26 which is very affordable. Signing up the the newsletter will get you a 10% discount code on your first purchase. 

Currently, there is a 10% Summer discount for the fragrances Lawn Girl and Lake Days.

Long story short: I love the inspiration and the thoughtfulness that goes into these fragrances. I've never been to Knoxville but these fragrances make me want to visit. I know I am buying a full bottle of 1998 when its in season and I am excited to sample the other fall/winter scents once they become available (especially 1993 and Neyland). There are no misses from this brand so I won't have a ""bottom"" but I'll add my comments on what I think of their other works.

Other Comments: Quick shipping time, got my samples within 2 weeks. Nothing leaked in transit but one of the bottle sprayers tops came off when I uncapped it. It was an easy fix with tape and I reached out to Amber to let her know. For my extra sample, I asked for something that is out of season but mentioned it was okay if it wasn't available. She went out of her way to give me the sample I requested, which is incredibly nice.

Goth Fragrance Bestie interviewed Amber for his Goth Fragrance Dialogues. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBD38l-njBk&t=1s) if you are interested

My tops:

**1998**

* Notes: amber, embers, pot marigold, pumpkin, spices
* Thoughts: This is it. My search for the perfect pumpkin scent is over. Most pumpkin scents I've encountered are essentially a pumpkin spice latte scent, but not this one. This is the smell of a candle that has been burning inside a pumpkin. The pumpkin is seated next to pots of Mum flowers and is giving off a lightly roasted smell. That blends with the unsweetened baking spices and uncured wood. Its a warm and inviting scent that leans a bit gourmand without it being going all the way.
* Once this fragrance is back in season, I will probably buy two full bottles cause 8ml is just not enough to get me through the season.

There are no bottoms but here are my thoughts on the other fragrances from this brand:

**1928**

* Notes: amber, gin, juniper berry, musk, tonic water
* Thoughts: This fragrance was made to honor the year the Tennessee Theatre opened its doors. The interior is Spanish-Moorish but also contains Czechoslovakian crystals in the French-style chandeliers, Italian terrazzo flooring in the Grand Lobby, and Asian influences in the carpet and drapery patterns. It was one of the first public places in Knoxville to have air-conditioning. This theatre and fragrance, are an homage to a time of decadence. Due to the high concentration of Juniper Berry EO in this fragrance, it truly has a realistic gin and tonic aroma. Its an evergreen scent with hints of other botanicals and to top it off, this scent captured the fizz of the tonic. Its like you stepped into a Gatsby party, where prohibition doesn't matter. The gin and tonic will smoothly transition into a lightly sweet and sensual musk that is a little warm. Its the smell of perfumed skin that has been dancing all night. 

**1991**

* Notes: aged wood, grapefruit, seawater
* Thoughts: This scent is named after the year Knoxville had its first Pride Parade and the notes come from the Perfumer's memories of summer by the ocean. Its a scent of joyful celebration. This makes me think of tubing down the salt river in Phoenix, AZ. Not quite fresh water, its a little bit earthy. Spots along the river are shaded by trees, giving some relief from the sun. Its pulling your tube out of the river onto a sandy bank to open the lunch cooler that is filled with grapefruit and some saltwater taffy. While on your lunch break, you sit in the heat and listen to the cicadas cry. At the end of the day my skin is covered in sweat, salt, and some of the earthiness from the stirred up silt. This is a lightly sweet but still tart citrus scent that is salty and woody. Its nostalgic, versatile, and fun.  
* Extra thoughts: My initial thought when spraying this, was to compare it to Parakeet from Cirrus Parfum. There are similarities in how the grapefruit note is used but I would say they are cousins. If you thought Parakeet was too sweet and floral but think something more tart, woody, and salty would be more your style, then this might be the grapefruit scent you are looking for.  
* **IMPORTANT**: 20% of sales of this fragrance will be donated to the UTK Pride Center.

**Candoro Marble**

* Notes: peppermint, rose, sandalwood
* Thoughts: This fragrance was made to honor Tennessee pink marble and the extensive history it has played in that city as well as the whole country. This marble is featured from Grand Central station in New York to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. While I have been to both locations, I never noticed the marble. After testing this fragrance, I regret not taking the time. This scent does conjure the image of a cold stone. The stone isn't lifeless, it has veins of light mint green and an undertone of rose pink. There is a hint of powder that makes me feel like this stone is freshly cut and not yet carved. This is a fresh cold rose scent. Typically, I do not like rose scents but this is a really good rose.

**Coconut**

* Notes: coconut, grass, leather, musk
* Thoughts: If you have ever had the pleasure of traveling to a tropical island for vacation and having a fresh coconut cracked open right in front of you, then you would also recognize that this a fairly photo realistic coconut. This is pulling the coconut right off the tree, there is a burst of bright bitter green as it separates. The dirty husk is peeled away and a man with a machete hacks to the center. There you find the crispy white flesh that is slightly creamy and the refreshing water inside. This isn't a sunscreen, fruity cocktail, or shampoo coconut. Its a dirty coconut with creamy freshness inside.

**Hodges**

* Notes: aged paper, orris root, vanilla, woods
* Thoughts: This fragrance is named after Hodges Library at the University of Tennessee. The perfumer toiled away in this library while working on her PhD and to honor that, she wanted to capture the scent of books. To me this didn't register as books or a library, which isn't a bad thing. Instead it feels like someone is living out in the woods has been trying to distill their own vanilla extract and somehow they spilled a bunch of the vanilla extract on the forest floor. The sweet vanilla blends with the rich earth and pine needs. It almost tempts you to eat the soil. The vanilla slowly grows in strength and goes from dirty to creamy with hints of wood.

**House Mountain**

* Notes: Bergamot, Blue Sky, Hemlock Fir
* Thoughts: A fragrance inspired by the Great Smoky Mountains, a mountain range spanning from North Carolina to Tennessee. The name comes from the natural fog that hangs over the range and looks like smoke from a distance. This smells like you hiked deep into the woods and are standing on a ledge looking out over the scenery. You pull out the limeade you brought with you and the wind blows hard enough to almost push you. You catch yourself but fir needles got into your refreshing tart drink. This is an airy balsamic citrus scent. Its refreshing and a bit cooling. Its perfect for a hot summer day.

**Lake Days**

* Notes: Aquatic, cedarwood, inflatable tube, mimosa, suntan lotion
* Thoughts: This is the smell of the neighborhood lake. Its deep in the woods but everyone knows the way. Over the years people have made a path just by walking the same route over and over. Along the path are native plants and flowers, growing unchecked. Its hot out and it adds a heaviness to the atmosphere, making the florals' indolic notes even more intense and honeyed. When you get to the lake, it is brown and murky but refreshing and lively with people lounging on the shore and others jumping into the water. This is a balsamic wood and earthy aquatic floral scent that can be very nostalgic if you are someone who spent large chunks of your childhood going to the local lake.

**Lawn Girl**

* Notes: grass, magnolia, musk, sensual skin
* Thoughts: Amber's first fragrance, the one that started it all. A fragrance inspired by the perfumer cutting the grass while the magnolia tree in her front yard is in full bloom. This scent perfectly represents that. This is laying out on lawn chair under a magnolia tree on a sunny day. The neighbor is mowing the lawn and gardening, the scent of fresh cut grass and turned earth fill the air along with the floral scent.

**Red Daisy**

* Notes: Beer, Cannabis, Daisy, Frankincense, Patchouli
* Thoughts: This fragrance is inspired by the Perfumer's love for Billy Strings, a bluegrass/jam band. Specifically, they have a song called Red Daisy. This fragrance feels like you have smoked a little too much at an outdoor concert. You feel a little hazy and sluggish, laying down in the grass while the sun shines on you and the band plays. You wear a crown of daisies and are sweating out the beer. The people next to you are burning incense. When you go home, your jeans are covered in dirt, grass, flower petals, and some spilled beer got on the bottom of your jeans. This is a scent that really captures the vibe of an outdoor concert. I would like to add that the weed note is realistic without being dank or skunky.

**Sunsphere Sunset**

* Notes: amber, coffee, lavender, sandalwood
* Thoughts: The Sunsphere is a 266-foot tall structure topped with a gold colored glass sphere, serving as a symbol of the 1982 World's Fair. As recently as 2022, the sphere was opened to the public and offers a 360 degree view of the area. Like the structure, this fragrance is a little bit decadent but not lavishly so. This is a fancy coffee, when the coffee house uses the really good beans and actually knows how to make a brew without making it super bitter. This is a creamy coffee with spices and lavender. Its a subtle sweetness so its not one of those frappes or lattes that are more syrup flavoring than coffee. Its a good balance and there are hints of citrusy wood that keeps this fragrance light. This is like your skin but better with cream and coffee.",4,1750787981.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,0.83,False

Chilean Route 7 is an iconic bikepacking pilgrammage, funneling hundreds of globetrotting cyclists each year into its jagged swan dive towards the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego.

More steep gravel switchbacks and loathsome ripios. More frantic marathons between tight ferry connections. Bucolic harbor towns idling in the steam of hot morning coffee and the trumpeting foghorn of imminent departures. Falling asleep on the boat‚Äôs steel cargo deck floor, an exhausted heap puddled beneath my own bike. Waves lapping at my shoes. Gently rocked between dreams by the motor‚Äôs calming troll.

Overhead, the sky seemed to change its mind every hour. A brooding purple nebula of ominous rainclouds and swirling headwinds. Always some melodic chime of running water in the distance, glacial peaks and hidden falls weaving mossy braids of riverbed down below.

More volcanic vistas. More picnic stops for warm empanadas. I bought them by the dozen as often as possible and kept them close by in a brown paper bag, tiny morsels of encouragement in the rain. A Uruguayan road tripper asked if I would like ‚Äúa real cup of coffee for once‚Äù before unveiling his prized AeroPress with a specially marked jar of beans. He laughed at the excited tears in my eyes. We both did.

1lji1k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellbeingHypnotherapy/comments/1lji1k2/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts ‚Äì just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let‚Äôs clear up a misconception: introversion doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren‚Äôt overwhelming.

Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished ‚Äì unable to pass on their genes.) That‚Äôs one of the factors why we‚Äôre here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring‚Äîit‚Äôs exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you‚Äôre definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don‚Äôt have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It‚Äôs a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.

¬†

**Signs You‚Äôre an Introvert with Anxiety‚Äîwhich ones do you relate to the most?**

1. You Typically Overprepare

You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control‚Äîbut it can also be draining.

Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‚Äò‚Äôbest case scenario‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äì luck isn‚Äôt a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn‚Äôt stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.

¬†

2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic

Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active‚Äîsometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.

Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won‚Äôt be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‚ÄòFrom Limitations to Liberation‚Äô ‚Äì it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs.

¬†

3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy

Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it‚Äôs a high energy ‚Äòstate‚Äô ‚Äì one of the reasons it can be so tiring)‚Äîconstantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.

Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‚Äòwhat is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?‚Äô

¬†

4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan

Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets ‚Äì sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.

Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new caf√©. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‚Äòprogrammed‚Äô by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‚Äòprogramming‚Äô new avenues of opportunity open up for us.¬†

¬†

5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask

You‚Äôve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not taking a toll internally.

Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it‚Äôs just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.

¬†

6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations

Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options ‚Äì see my article ‚ÄòLive the life you choose ‚Äì expand your Thought-Action Repertoire‚Äô), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.

Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you‚Äôre anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event‚Äîlike having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.

¬†

7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing

Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like ‚ÄúI need everyone to like me to be valuable‚Äù create intense anxiety around how you‚Äôre perceived.

Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‚Äòthem‚Äô?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you‚Äôre not responsible for everyone else‚Äôs happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.

¬†

8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker

Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.

Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it‚Äôs not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.

¬†

9. Trouble Sleeping

Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.

Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it‚Äôs time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‚Äòlights out‚Äô time ‚Äì read until your eyes close and your head nods.

¬†

**Moving From Awareness to Action**

Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You‚Äôre not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself‚Äîthere‚Äôs strength in softness.

¬†

**Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert**

¬†

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Create and Protect Your Recharge Time

For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it‚Äôs 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you‚Äîit‚Äôs a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.

¬†

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions

We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.

¬†

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Prepare and Plan for Social Situations

One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn‚Äôt mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don‚Äôt even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.

¬†

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Create a Space at Home that Grounds You

Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed‚Äîthis could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.

¬†

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harness Your Listening Superpower

Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen‚Äîthis not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

¬†

So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?

And what are your own go to strategies?

It‚Äôs a Tissot PRX Powermatic 80: perfectly respectable, but hardly haute horology.

Derek‚Äôs eyes locked on the waffle dial like it was a prize in a claw machine.

‚ÄúNice PRX,‚Äù he said, rolling the acronym on his tongue like he‚Äôd just discovered it. ‚ÄúYou know, first-impression optics matter. My Timex Weekender isn‚Äôt exactly closing six-figure deals. How about you let me rock yours for the summit? Team prosperity vibe, right?‚Äù

I laughed. He didn‚Äôt.

He followed up with a Slack DM:
Derek K. ‚Äî ‚ÄòNeed the PRX 4 success ‚úåÔ∏è. Let‚Äôs do a 24-hr loaner.‚Äô
Then he dropped a calendar invite titled ‚ÄúWatch Handoff | Mandatory.‚Äù

I declined it. Politely.

Tuesday
He ambushed me at the coffee machine, explaining that since we‚Äôd be pitching Swiss VCs, a Swiss watch was, technically, a ‚Äúclient-alignment asset.‚Äù He offered collateral: his Patagonia vest‚Äîretail $129‚Äîand a verbal promise to ‚Äútreat it like a newborn.‚Äù

Wednesday
He looped my manager in an email, cc‚Äôing HR, implying that, by withholding the watch, I was ‚Äúundermining unified brand presentation.‚Äù HR replied with a single-line policy reminder: ‚ÄúPersonal property remains personal.‚Äù Full stop.

Thursday
Derek cornered me again: ‚ÄúFine, but if we lose this deal because I couldn‚Äôt borrow a mid-tier watch, that‚Äôs on you.‚Äù

The comeuppance

We flew to Austin Sunday night. Monday morning, Derek strode into the hotel lobby puffed up with confidence‚Äîand, sure enough, a Tissot PRX gleaming on his wrist. Or something that wanted to be one: the seconds hand ticked instead of sweeping, the date window font was wrong, and the bracelet links were hollow enough to rattle.

I raised an eyebrow. He smirked: ‚ÄúAmazon overnight. Saved your precious timepiece, buddy.‚Äù

During the pitch, one of the Swiss VCs‚Äîturns out he collects mid-century Omegas‚Äîspotted the watch immediately.

‚ÄúInteresting PRX,‚Äù the VC said, pausing the slide deck. ‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù
Derek froze but extended his wrist. The VC flipped it over, revealing a blank caseback where the exhibition glass should‚Äôve been.
‚ÄúAh,‚Äù the VC nodded, ‚Äúa creative interpretation.‚Äù

You could feel the oxygen leave the room. Derek stumbled through the rest of the demo while the VC exchanged amused glances with his colleagues.

We didn‚Äôt land the deal that day. Back at HQ, leadership decided Derek would ‚Äúfocus on internal enablement‚Äù for the foreseeable future‚Äîno client-facing travel. Apparently, misrepresenting both product specs and your wristwear in front of investors isn‚Äôt ‚Äúon-brand.‚Äù

Meanwhile, my genuine PRX stayed on my wrist, keeping steady 80-hour power reserve and an even steadier moral of the story:

The chorus was repetitive and had a style that was a bit house, jazzy, and classy. It was a fairly well-known track from the 2000s, but not too recent‚ÄîI‚Äôd say it came out after 2000 but definitely not before 1990, and probably not after 2018 either, because the sound quality was modern but not ultra-new. I don‚Äôt remember if there were any verses or if it was mostly instrumental with just the chorus, where the man would sing with that deep voice. It was a song that really got popular, because I remember hearing it a lot in my youth. If anyone can help me find it, that would be amazing.

Just to be clear, it‚Äôs not songs like ‚ÄúCasablanca,‚Äù it‚Äôs not like ‚ÄúKhona‚Äù either, and it‚Äôs definitely not ‚ÄúOliver Twist‚Äù‚Äîbut maybe it‚Äôs in that style. Thank you for letting me know if you have any ideas and I‚Äôll tell you if that‚Äôs the one or not. Thanks!

Chilean Route 7 is an iconic bikepacking pilgrammage, funneling hundreds of globetrotting cyclists each year into its jagged swan dive towards the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego.

More steep gravel switchbacks and loathsome ripios. More frantic marathons between tight ferry connections. Bucolic harbor towns idling in the steam of hot morning coffee and the trumpeting foghorn of imminent departures. Falling asleep on the boat‚Äôs steel cargo deck floor, an exhausted heap puddled beneath my own bike. Waves lapping at my shoes. Gently rocked between dreams by the motor‚Äôs calming troll.

Overhead, the sky seemed to change its mind every hour. A brooding purple nebula of ominous rainclouds and swirling headwinds. Always some melodic chime of running water in the distance, glacial peaks and hidden falls weaving mossy braids of riverbed down below.

More volcanic vistas. More picnic stops for warm empanadas. I bought them by the dozen as often as possible and kept them close by in a brown paper bag, tiny morsels of encouragement in the rain. A Uruguayan road tripper asked if I would like ‚Äúa real cup of coffee for once‚Äù before unveiling his prized AeroPress with a specially marked jar of beans. He laughed at the excited tears in my eyes. We both did.

But there‚Äôd been rumors of bad weather barreling in. Its threat spread between cyclists like a dirty word not to be spoken too loudly. ‚ÄúWhere will you go? How far do you think you can get before the storm?‚Äù We looked out upon the road and shared what we knew.",8,1750787498.0,BeAmazed,2,1.0,False
1ljhxdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1ljhxdi/how_many_languages_do_you_really_speak/,How many languages do you 'really' speak?,"Lately, I've been seeing a lot of people online casually saying they ""speak 5+ languages.""
And honestly? I'm starting to doubt most of them.

Speaking a language isn't just being able to introduce yourself or order a coffee. It's being able to hold a real conversation, express your thoughts, debate a topic, or even crack a joke. That takes years, not just Duolingo streaks and vocab apps.
And yet, you'll see someone say ""I speak 6 languages,"" when in reality, they can barely hold a basic conversation in two of them.
It feels like being ""multilingual"" became trendy, or a kind of humblebrag to flex in bios, dating apps, or interviews.

For context: I speak my native language, plus 'X' others at different levels. And even with those, I still hesitate to say ‚ÄúI speak X‚Äù unless I can actually use the language in real-life situations. I know how much work it takes, that‚Äôs why this topic hits a nerve.
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong,  learning languages is beautiful, and any level of effort should be celebrated.
But can we please stop pretending ""studied Spanish in high school"" means you speak Spanish?

I'm genuinely curious now:
How do you define 'speaking a language'?
Is there a line between learning and actually speaking fluently?

I‚Äôve been living in AECS Layout for a while now, working as a software developer (like half of Bangalore, I guess üòÖ). Lately, my weekends have become... well, boring. I just end up scrolling Instagram endlessly or re-watching old YouTube videos. I'm out of good movies to watch (and honestly, there aren't any exciting ones releasing either).

The real problem is ‚Äì I don‚Äôt really have friends here. I'm an introvert by nature, but lately I feel like I want to break this cycle and actually meet people, explore the city, maybe find folks to hang out with over coffee, walks, workouts ‚Äì anything that doesn't involve staring at a screen.

Tried dating apps ‚Äì no luck. Feels like they‚Äôre not really meant for meaningful connections anymore (at least for me).

Is anyone else in the same boat? Or do you know of any Bangalore communities, hobby groups, meetups (especially in or near AECS Layout/Whitefield) that are chill and introvert-friendly?

Any suggestions, ideas, or even just a ""you‚Äôre not alone"" would mean a lot.

Does anyone have a tasty home-grown / homemade recipe for a coffee flavored yogurt drink? I used to love the Chobani Complete coffee flavored yogurt drinks but they were discontinued last year. Since then, I've found plain drinkable yogurt and all kinds of coffee concentrate and such but I cannot for the life of me concoct any kind of coffee-yogurt drink mixture that tastes good. 

Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated. TIA",1,1750786940.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False

We moved fast in the beginning, things were so easy and we are just best friends, great communication, chemistry, things in common - we both love to hike, read, art, etc. We both truly feel like soulmates, both past divorced from our first partners, etc. He is usually very thoughtful, surprising me with coffee every Thursday from the beginning, bringing me food, cooking breakfast and lunch, etc. He definitely has a very protective demeanor and works very hard. We also are both ambitious with good jobs. We laughed a lot but he teases a lot out of love which is usually fine.

Slowly over time, he did state that he was taking things more seriously, so things I was doing around the house etc suddenly wasn't good enough. We'd have family time, but each time he had good things to say, but always critiques, like I'm not thoughtful enough, I keep forgetting things like unplugging the rice if I open it first, etc. I ask what I can do to be more thoughtful, he says he doesn't know, and that if he told me it doesn't count. I would keep trying, but it was always not enough. I started making coffee for him the night before, I missed a few days and then he brought it up that it caused him to lose trust, and didn't understand that I felt that was a little harsh after a few mistakes. Also, issues of me offering to do things like dishes, and he'd turn down my offers so I'd stop asking, and he'd get frustrated at me that I wasn't helping (he'd often get to them first so I couldn't just do them without asking).

Fast forward to a month ago, we're both childfree by choice and I've considered getting sterilized. I am on BC, and take it as directed, but somehow got pregnant anyway. It was a shock, and he was very supportive at first, it was very conflicting and I was struggling mentally, but followed through with a medical termination. He's not typically an overly emotional guy, but I am and was struggling and the night before my appointment I asked him how he was feeling, he made a ""so so"" face and said he was neutral. I got hurt, and responded, and it turned into a big argument where he thought I was asking how he felt THAT SECOND, not how he felt overall. I kept trying to clarify, but to this day he denies remembering that I ever clarified and swears he thought I was demanding he feel sad that second, and he got angry and said that I reminded him of his toxic dad, throwing a pity party, etc, and ended up sleeping downstairs. I was so hurt, considering the situation, and self harmed that night which I haven't done in years.

He didn't address it the next day, I was also dealing with the mental trauma of dealing with the abortion etc, but I brought it up that night, trying to explain how I felt hurt by what he said and he wouldn't apologize, stating that he thought I was telling him what to feel (which I think it was excessive even then). I then said I hurt myself - he didn't reply. I thought he didn't hear me and moved on, but when asked later he said he did hear my ""but assumed that you just scratched yourself like you used to"". He didn't understand why that hurt me that he didn't ask.

There were many other instances though, of trying to have a conversation and get across something he did hurt me and why, and him stating his thoughts at the moment without empathy. He's so cold. Talking to him hurts and causes me anxiety because he doesn't understand me - I've been super low and suicidal, he knows that but is holding me at arms length. Even the other night when we're trying to understand each other, something new happens - he tweaked his back in the morning and I offered to help multiple times that day, taking the dogs out, grabbing dishes, etc - but he declined each time and said he didn't want to restrict himself. Then when we went to take the trash out, he came back in and asked ""Do you wanna help me?"" and I jumped up and immediately helped. Turned out he's mad that I didn't offer to help, and when I said that was unfair because he declined my help all day he says that I ""should have realized the trash was heaver and offered"". I think he feels misunderstood and I feel like I'm playing a game I can't win, and also very unsupported in one of the darkest points of my life. Am I overreacting, am I expecting too much from a man? To be empathetic and alter his reactions/words based on my mental state and the context of the situation?? Am I overreacting or is his behavior in crises even more telling than everything else?

TL;DR: BF is stoic in general, but very physically supportive (footrubs, bringing and cooking food, etc) but after an abortion he is not being empathetic and denies things that I said in arguments which makes me feel crazy, just generally not caring or apologizing with a ""but..."" when he hurts my feelings because he stands behind what he was feeling at the time. Am I crazy or overreacting? What in the world is going on.",1,1750786892.0,AIO,4,1.0,False

I feel like i'll come off as someone faking it and usually i can kinda slow down alot when talking to others but apparently not when really into the convo cause i've been told i talk fast sometimes., rn it just comes naturally sometimes it won't.

Post:

I switched therapists cause reasons.. sort of? and I sort of didn't. My past one said i sounded like pressured speech and said i had psychosis(implied i had schizophrenia/developing and that its just not fully severe yet???)

 but honestly??? I'm fine now except for the past few days(and this keeps happening) I just went from feeling down in the dumps to elated. Magic is in the air this does sound like hypomania but not severe enough to be mania or ruin my life. I cant stop singing doing things and my rooms a mess but i'm working on gettng it cleaned(ngl i did run out of clean clothes).

Paragraphs are needed so heres a break. my thoughts are in 3d space floating and bumping into eachother(mostly the other day) all is so great I just want to shout and celebrate the rhymes are flowing and my prose is going! Yk? Like i need to calm i need to focus(I havent done anything these past week actually and i meant to catch up on study material this summer and i'm doing horribly so thats going to be another bad semester). I quit coffee 3 weeks ago so... yeah its going great and now i'm so elate.

Like writing i get i sound rushed and i get when others tell me to slow down cause i'm talking to fast. Apparently moodiness is just normal hormones and women issues yk how sexism is? I'm so damn insecure.

How do I talk to my therapist without sounding like i'm faking except like.. if i switch i have no claims for this and will 100% sound like it. I need to schedule an appt with a psychiatrist but haven't. Yk whats also funny? I have a physical in 2 days so if this doesn't calm down then rofl... but it will probs(I feel like i'm just going to start going faster and aster and the last time i made myself go down was with alcohol but i'm not going to do that again cause later i freaked out i was going to develop alcoholism so i'm not doing that ever again nor touching a sip of that. (It also made me feel like absolute shit(im cussing too much wtf). )

So yeah... What if all my issues are alcohol induced cause i tried to drink a sip of alcohol a day before my 21st birthday? I mean its unlikely but whatever.... and i had issues prior like i was convinced a plant i had was just sunlight depleted and i burnt it trying to give it enough sunlight(its ok now).",1,1750786854.0,BipolarReddit,4,1.0,False

1ljhdk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDrugstore/comments/1ljhdk1/the_startstop_technique_a_modern_howto_guide/,The Start-Stop Technique: A Modern How-To Guide,"The goal of this book is to provide a modern take on the start-stop technique, which aims to help people improve their focus and productivity.

Today, it can be hard to keep focused on work due to the endless amount of notifications and emails that bombard us. According to a study conducted by UC Irvine, it takes about 23 minutes for people to regain their concentration after an interruption. This suggests that even just a single email or ping can negatively affect your productivity.

Those who are working remotely or juggling several responsibilities may find themselves constantly affected by digital distractions.

The Start-Stop technique can help people avoid getting distracted by the endless notifications.

The start-stop technique is a step that people can take to avoid getting interrupted at work.

The start-stop technique is based on behavioral science, and it can help people improve their focus and productivity.

Start by identifying one habit or behavior that supports your goals. Then, identify one behavior that drains your energy, focus, or time.

The start-stop technique is a step that people can take to improve their mental and behavioral health. It helps them identify and remove the negative habits that keep them from achieving their goals.

The start-stop technique is also aligned with the advice of behavioral experts such as Charles Duhigg, who is the author of the book ""The Power of Habit."" According to him, the key to changing a habit is understanding its structure.

The origin of the start-stop method can be traced back to the teachings of behavioral scientists. Charles Duhigg states that understanding a habit's structure is the key to breaking free from it.

The effectiveness of the start-stop technique can be attributed to its intentionality and simplicity.

According to the APA, setting specific intentions can double the chances of success when it comes to making changes in behavior.

The start-stop method uses the reinforcement theory, which states that positive reinforcement is provided by starting good habits, while negative reinforcement is brought about by removing undesirable ones.

Habit loops can be established by combining beneficial habits with the elimination of negative ones, which can lead to sustained improvement.

USC psychology professor Wendy Wood stated that people tend to focus on the positive aspects of their habits while forgetting that the goal of their new habits is to let go of the negative ones.

Developing essential habits and habit removal can help train your brain to support long-term goals.

The start-stop method is broken down into a series of steps that can help people develop essential habits.

The start-stop method doesn't require a lot of equipment or knowledge. It can be done in a simple manner by allowing yourself to reflect on and change your behavior.

The first step in the start-stop method is to conduct a self-assessment.

To start implementing the start-stop method, take a look at your daily routines.

Take a look at your daily routine and ask yourself questions such as: How do I start my day? When and how do I take breaks? You can also check out the amount of time you spend on social media and screens.

Try to identify your own habits that can help uplift and energize you. List out the behaviors that leave you feeling drained or distracted.



List out the habits that you want to start and the ones that you want to stop.

Start: Going to bed by 10:30 PM.

You should refrain from drinking caffeinated beverages after 4 pm.

The second step involves choosing one start and one stop.

While you may have multiple items on your list, focus on one from each category. This will help you start small and sustain success.

To start, create a short list of three items that you want to tackle in the morning. Then, stop using social media and emails before 9 am.

One of the most effective habits that you can implement is pairing your goals with your existing routines. For instance, start a 10-minute walk around lunchtime and stop using devices while taking a break.

Setting clear goals and rewards can help motivate and sustain your efforts.

A study conducted by a psychology journal revealed that associating certain actions with a specific trigger can help people maintain consistency.

Start by assigning a time and a place for your START habit. Then, replace the triggers with healthy alternatives.

You can avoid late-night snacking by brushing your teeth and preparing herbal tea.

You can also start a daily meditation practice by placing a yoga mat by your bedroom. On your alarm, set a reminder that says ""Breathe First.""

You can find a wide range of wellness and productivity aids at [edrugStore.com](http://edrugStore.com), such as sleep solutions and energy boosters that can help improve your focus.

The fourth step of this process is to track your progress.

You can use a notebook, a habit tracker app, or a printed calendar to track your progress. Each time you complete a new habit, you will then mark a check.

Keeping track of your progress can help build momentum and reinforce your routine. According to behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg from Stanford University, celebrating small victories can help people develop lifelong habits.

Consistency is the key to success, not perfection. Don't let stress get in the way of making changes.

Take a break from your routine and reflect on how you're doing.

Write down the questions that you'll use to evaluate your progress after two to four weeks.

Assess your initial integration of the Start habit. Assess your initial impact on your mood, focus, and energy levels. Eliminating the Stop behavior was also evaluated.

After assessing your initial impact, swap or modify your habits in the succeeding cycle.

Start the new day by drinking water before your coffee. Clean up your social media usage before lunchtime.

Follow these simple steps to track your progress and stay motivated.

These are some proven suggestions that can help you maintain consistency.

Start small. For instance, ""meditate"" can refer to taking a deep breath. Instead of ""stop stress eating,"" try ""stop snacking after 8 PM."" Then, pair these changes with a morning walk.

The results of small steps can be big. For instance, stopping late-night snacking can help decrease your stress levels.

Trying to change everything at the same time can lead to burnout. Instead, focus on one positive habit and one negative behavior at a time.

The goal of the Start-Stop strategy is to improve your focus and protect your time. It helps you develop a life that is aligned with your goals.

To start the process, open your journal or app and write down one habit to start and one to stop.",1,1750786240.0,EDrugstore,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boca Juniors vs. Auckland City FC: A Foreseeable Farce (With a Side of Hopeful Hysteria)**

**The Setup:** Boca Juniors, the Argentine giants, face Auckland City FC, the underdog who lost 6-0 to Benfica in their last match. The odds? **Boca at 1.01** (basically a math test with one answer), **Auckland at 85.00** (a long shot longer than a Netflix queue), and a **draw at 41.00** (for people who bet on ""miracles"").

**Why It‚Äôs a Pickle for Auckland:** Miguel √Ångel Russo of Boca isn‚Äôt just asking for a win‚Äîhe‚Äôs demanding a *victory parade* to have a shot at the quarterfinals. Meanwhile, Auckland‚Äôs coach is probably Googling ‚Äúhow to win against a team that‚Äôs already celebrating.‚Äù Their previous match? A 6-0 drubbing. This one might be worse.

**Player Props to Waste Your Money On:**

* **Edinson Cavani (-200)** to score? Sure, why not. He‚Äôs a legend, but at these odds, it‚Äôs like betting your coffee will eventually go cold.
* **Carlos Palacios (-122)** for any goal? Palacios is the only one here with a shot (on target or otherwise).
* **Milton Gimenez (-265)** to take 3.5+ shots? If he‚Äôs not scoring, he‚Äôs at least firing blanks *enthusiastically*.

**The Spread & Total:** Bovada has Boca as **-5.0** favorites, with the total goals line at **5.5**. Given Benfica‚Äôs 6-0 thrashing of Auckland, this could be a ""Boca scores 5, Auckland scores 0, fans check their watches, and everyone goes home early"" kind of night.

**The Verdict:** Boca will win comfortably, likely by more than the required margin, while Auckland will serve as a reminder that the Club World Cup‚Äôs ""group stage"" is less a tournament and more a mercy mission for the minnows.

**Final Score Prediction:** **Boca 5, Auckland 0** (because even the most generous sportsbook wouldn‚Äôt dare offer better odds than this).

*Note: If you bet on a draw, you‚Äôve officially entered the realm of ""I‚Äôll take my chances with crypto.""*

Around a month ago this cute guy (23-25M?) walked up to me (26F) and started asking me about an exercise I was doing. He was pretty jacked so this was surprising to me. The next time I saw him he said he tried the exercise and that it was really good, then asked me for more tips. He asked me where I was from, how long I‚Äôve been going to the gym, etc. He saw me a few days later and was also really chatty, asked me if I had any plans for the night, what I do for work, if I go to the gym on the weekends. At first I thought he was just an outgoing guy who wanted to learn more about lifting, but I‚Äôve never seen him talk to anyone else, just me.

Last Wednesday him and I were talking and at the end of the conversation I said ""I have a question... are you single?"" He looked a little shocked but he said yes and then asked if I was too. He suggested we get a coffee sometime and that he would be out of town this weekend.

Yesterday morning he walked right up to me and waved to get my attention, then he gets all chatty again asking what I did on the weekend. At the end of the conversation I just casually asked ‚Äúhey, did you ever end up texting me?‚Äù And he said no he just had a really busy weekend.

A few years ago I was like a lot of folks who had never had a panic attack and never suffered from anxiety. Now I suffer from periodic attacks, and a baseline noticeable level of anxiety. 

Long story short, I had my first panic attack a few years ago. I thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack and went to the ER. Obviously they told me it was just a panic attack, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt scary. It left me with PTSD - I never wanted to feel that ever again. 

I quit smoking weed and nicotine. I couldn‚Äôt drink alcohol or coffee for months. Any sort of out of mind, or mind altering, made me panic. 

I didn‚Äôt want to let it control me. I debated ‚Äúsewer slide‚Äù. I thought about anything I could do to make it go away. 

I‚Äôm very lucky in that I have a wife who suffers from anxiety as well, and a mom that suffers from depression. They all talked me through all of it. This made me not feel alone. They talked me into getting a therapist. 

I‚Äôm here to tell anyone who needs to hear it that it gets better. It takes time but it does. I remember searching endlessly for proof tat it goes away. I feel like those who start to recover come to these communities less, but everyone could use some assurance. 

The volume of anxiety goes down. I was a 15/10. Now I‚Äôm a 3-4/10. I can drink coffee and a beer. I can go on a plane. I can socialize. I can do all the things I used to. 

Talk to someone. Get a therapist. It gets better.

First was the \*\*sound\*\*.



Old Faithful doesn‚Äôt just roar. Right before each eruption, if you‚Äôre close enough ‚Äî say, on the wrong side of the rope ‚Äî there‚Äôs a faint tone beneath the hiss. A whistling, but deeper. More musical. I once compared it to an old wind-up music box, slowed down and half-melted.



At first, I thought it was machinery. Maybe seismic instruments humming inside the pit. But it wasn‚Äôt regular. Some eruptions had it. Some didn‚Äôt.



And when it \*did\* happen, the dogs in the crowd would whine. Children would cover their ears. And one time, I swear to God, a woman fainted before the water even sprayed.



She hit the pavement, hard. Later said she heard \*\*her dead father‚Äôs voice in the steam.\*\*



We brushed it off. Heatstroke. Altitude sickness. Typical park issues.



But it kept happening.



 



The turning point for me was late September, during the shoulder season. Fewer crowds. Colder winds. Bison lumbered through the fog in slow silhouettes.



I was assigned a midnight perimeter check ‚Äî routine for off-season. Flashlight in hand, radio clipped to my vest, boots crunching the frozen gravel path around Old Faithful. The geyser doesn‚Äôt erupt like clockwork at night. That‚Äôs a myth. It‚Äôs mostly silent. Sleeping.



But at 12:47 AM, it went off.



No warning.



No pre-bubbling, no seismic trigger.



Just a \*\*single sharp whistle\*\* that cracked through the cold, followed by a surge of water so fast it shook the ground.



I fell on my ass.



Steam flooded the clearing. Dense. Blinding. And then I heard something that still haunts me:



\*\*Footsteps\*\*. Coming from \*inside\* the steam.



Not loud. Not heavy. Just‚Ä¶ wet. Barefoot. One after another.



I called out, thinking someone had jumped the fence. ‚ÄúYou need to come back to the trail!‚Äù



The steps paused.



Then turned.



And ran directly at me.



I couldn‚Äôt see a damn thing ‚Äî just fog and shadows. My flashlight hit nothing but vapor. But the sound was real. Getting louder. Faster.



I raised my radio.



Before I could press the button, the footsteps stopped inches from my face.



And something whispered:



  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the one we‚Äôre waiting for.‚Äù



The fog cleared within seconds. Nothing was there. No footprints. No water on the ground. Just me, trembling, alone in the silence.



I filed the report as a steam pocket release. Didn‚Äôt mention the voice. Didn‚Äôt mention how the batteries in my radio \*\*melted inside the casing\*\*.



But I knew what I heard.



And it was only the beginning.







There‚Äôs an old utility basement beneath the Upper Geyser Basin lodge that most visitors ‚Äî and even a lot of staff ‚Äî don‚Äôt know about. Half of it‚Äôs sealed. The other half is used for storage. Forgotten hoses, rusted electrical panels, boxes of worn-out rain ponchos with logos that haven‚Äôt been used since the 80s.



I didn‚Äôt mean to find the journal.



I was down there looking for a portable generator during a brief power outage. Some storm knocked half the grid offline, and we were trying to keep guests from freezing upstairs.



It was buried behind a stack of folded cot frames in a milk crate that smelled like mildew and scorched copper.



Black leather. Water-damaged. No name on the cover.



Inside were dozens of entries written in the same tight, blocky handwriting. The dates ranged from 1991 to 1996. Pages were warped, but the ink hadn‚Äôt bled. And the entries weren‚Äôt casual field notes ‚Äî they were \*\*obsessions\*\*.



Whoever wrote it was watching Old Faithful long before I ever got here.



 



  \*\*October 3rd, 1991 ‚Äì 2:11AM\*\*

 

  ‚ÄúEruption was early again. Second time this week. But not listed in the logs. No seismic activity. Nothing from the sensors. Just‚Ä¶ started.

 

  Saw something in the plume. Not a figure, not exactly. A ripple. Like something huge pressed its face up against the inside of the earth. Like it was listening.‚Äù



  \*\*January 19th, 1992 ‚Äì 1:04AM\*\*

 

  ‚ÄúThey called it a steam burp again. I know better. I saw the dogs bolt BEFORE the eruption. One ran headfirst into a post. The guests didn‚Äôt notice, but the air \*vibrated\*.

 

  One of the newer rangers vomited. Said he smelled blood in the fog.‚Äù



  \*\*April 25th, 1994 ‚Äì Undated\*\*

 

  ‚ÄúI saw her again. Standing in the mist. Wearing my wife‚Äôs coat. But she‚Äôs been dead ten years. She mouthed something. Same words as last time:

  ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs waking up.‚Äô‚Äù



 



Dozens of pages like that.



Some were crossed out. Others circled. But one word appeared over and over ‚Äî in the margins, in all caps, even once burned into a page with what looked like a cigarette:



\*\*SENTINEL\*\*



The last entry was short.



  \*\*August 11th, 1996\*\*

 

  ‚ÄúI think I was chosen. I think that‚Äôs what they want. I‚Äôve stopped dreaming in English. I need to go under.‚Äù



And that was it.



No name. No signature. No follow-up.



I asked the lodge director if there was ever a ranger stationed here in the 90s who just disappeared.



He went quiet for a moment.



Then said, ‚ÄúYou mean Ellis? Yeah. Real quiet guy. Kind of a loner. Went out for a thermal inspection and never came back. They think he slipped into a fumarole. But they never found a body.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt tell him about the journal.



Didn‚Äôt tell him I started dreaming in \*\*steam\*\* that night.



 



The next morning, Old Faithful erupted twenty-six minutes \*\*early\*\*.



Only one person was standing near the barrier fence ‚Äî a kid in a red hoodie. Everyone else was asleep. There wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a show. But it went off anyway.



And when I got closer, the boy turned to me and asked:



  ‚ÄúAre you the new Sentinel?‚Äù







I waited three days before opening the journal again. I kept it tucked in the bottom of my locker, beneath an emergency blanket and an old map of the Lower Loop. I tried to forget it.



I couldn‚Äôt.



I kept hearing the kid‚Äôs voice. \*‚ÄúAre you the new Sentinel?‚Äù\*



The way he said it wasn‚Äôt casual. It wasn‚Äôt a question. It was more like he was confirming something he already knew.



I asked around. No one on staff saw a boy that night. No parents reported a missing child. No red hoodie. I even checked with the other rangers on night shift ‚Äî one of them swore up and down that nobody was within 500 feet of the geyser when it erupted.



But I know what I saw.



And I knew it wasn‚Äôt the last time I‚Äôd see \*him\*.



 



I remembered the name the lodge director mentioned: \*\*Ranger Ellis\*\*.



I dug through old service records. Most had been digitized by 2001, but Ellis‚Äô file was thin. Just a printed folder. Name, DOB, hire date, and one final entry: ‚ÄúPresumed dead. Body unrecovered.‚Äù



No burial.



No forwarding address.



But something was odd ‚Äî his last listed emergency contact was blacked out. Not just crossed out. \*\*Redacted\*\*. Like someone took a marker and scrubbed the name from existence.



I took a day off and drove out to the northwestern edge of the park, near a forgotten ranger outpost called Fire Loop Ridge. It's not open to the public. Used to be a lookout before the main station took over. Most maps don‚Äôt even list it anymore.



But I‚Äôd heard rumors from older staff ‚Äî that Ellis built a cabin out there. Off-grid. No permits.



No one ever went to check.



 



I found it just before dusk.



No lights. No trail. Just a small A-frame shack nestled behind a curtain of pine, about a mile off the service road.



The door was cracked.



Inside: shelves lined with old geological surveys, laminated maps, and polaroids ‚Äî dozens of them. All of Old Faithful. But taken at \*\*weird angles\*\*. From the ground. From the treetops. One even looked like it was taken from \*inside the steam plume\*, impossible as that sounds.



Then I saw him.



Sitting in the corner.



Thin. Pale. Gray beard down to his chest. He didn‚Äôt even flinch when I stepped in. Just looked up at me with sunken eyes and said:



  ‚ÄúYou opened the journal, didn‚Äôt you.‚Äù



 



His name was Thomas Ellis, but he made me call him Tom.



He didn‚Äôt speak for long ‚Äî just long enough to tell me one thing:



  ‚ÄúThe geyser isn‚Äôt just geothermal. It‚Äôs biological. It has a pulse. And when it calls for a Sentinel, someone always answers.‚Äù



I asked him what that meant. He just shook his head.



Then said something I didn‚Äôt understand until much later:



  ‚ÄúThe last eruption won‚Äôt be water.‚Äù



He gave me a rusted thermal imaging sheet ‚Äî old tech, printed on transparent paper. It showed the geyser cone from above. But beneath it was \*\*a shape\*\*. Rounded. Almost skeletal.



And it was moving.



Very slowly.



Like something \*\*turning over in its sleep\*\*.



Tom wouldn‚Äôt speak anymore. He asked me to leave. Begged me, actually.



As I stepped out, I heard him whisper:



  ‚ÄúTell them not to dig.‚Äù



I never saw him again.



 



The next morning, the USGS conducted an unscheduled scan of Old Faithful. A report was filed internally. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see it.



But one of the techs left the tablet unlocked.



I saw three words highlighted in red across the core data readout:



  \*\*‚ÄúVascular geothermal anomaly.‚Äù\*\*



That night, I dreamed I was underground.



Curled in steam.



Listening to a \*\*heartbeat that wasn‚Äôt mine.\*\*







The visitor center burned down two nights after I visited Ellis.



I was the first to see the smoke. 2:11 AM, exactly. I was walking the lower basin trail, trying to clear my head, when I noticed the flicker behind the treeline. Orange glow pulsing through the steam like fireflies trapped in glass.



I radioed it in. Response came fast ‚Äî too fast.



Before I even finished my sentence, my supervisor, Jim Collins, came through loud and clear:



  ‚ÄúDisregard that. We're aware of the situation.‚Äù



His voice was calm.



Too calm.



By the time I got back to the visitor center, it was over. No flames. No ash. No structural damage. Just a black scorch mark across the northern wall ‚Äî \*\*in the shape of a hand\*\*. Five fingers. Each one stretching nearly six feet high.



No one else saw it.



By morning, the wall had been repainted. Fresh white. Glossy. Like nothing happened.



When I asked Jim what the hell was going on, he looked at me with the same expression you‚Äôd give a wild animal in the road. Not anger. Not pity.



Just distance.



  ‚ÄúThere are things older than the park. We maintain the story. That‚Äôs our job.‚Äù



He didn‚Äôt explain further.



Didn‚Äôt need to.



 



The tremors started the next night.



Always at \*\*2:09 AM\*\*.



The park‚Äôs seismic activity is monitored constantly ‚Äî minor shifts aren‚Äôt unusual. But this was different. These weren‚Äôt quakes. They were \*\*pulses\*\*.



Short. Rhythmic. Deep.



We checked the seismograph logs.



The pattern wasn‚Äôt random ‚Äî it was \*\*repeating\*\*. Five beats. Pause. Five beats. Pause.



Like something \*\*knocking\*\*.



Ellis' words came back to me:



  ‚ÄúThe last eruption won‚Äôt be water.‚Äù



 



I started sleeping in my truck near the geyser. Couldn‚Äôt explain why. I just needed to be close. I watched every plume. Logged every whistle. Listened to the vibrations in the ground.



Then, at 2:09 AM on the sixth night, Old Faithful erupted again ‚Äî but this time it didn‚Äôt spray water.



It bled.



Thick red vapor shot up into the air, staining the fog like oil in a snow globe. Tourists weren‚Äôt around to see it ‚Äî thank God. But I was.



And I swear, inside that crimson mist, I saw \*\*a ribcage\*\*. Just for a second.



Something enormous, curved, and hollow. Moving.



Breathing.



By the time backup arrived, the mist had cleared. The ground was dry. The air smelled like copper and rot.



I didn‚Äôt file a report.



Didn‚Äôt need to.



I wasn‚Äôt the only one watching that night.



There were others in the tree line.



Still figures.



No flashlights.



Just silhouettes.



Each wearing \*\*red hoodies\*\*.







The invitation came the next morning.



A folded note placed under my truck windshield. No envelope. No name. Just a stamped emblem I‚Äôd never seen before ‚Äî a black circle with three concentric rings and a single vertical line splitting them.



Inside, five words:



  ‚ÄúMaintenance Briefing. Below. 4:00 PM. Alone.‚Äù



I thought it was a joke. Then I saw Jim Collins waiting at the service elevator near the north rim compound. He didn‚Äôt smile. Just nodded once, held the door, and pressed a keycard I‚Äôd never seen before.



The elevator took us underground.



Far below anything I knew existed beneath Yellowstone.



 



We arrived at a concrete corridor with no markings. Cold fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The air smelled like clay and sterilizer. Jim led me in silence to a small conference room with mirrored walls and a long table of dark wood.



Seven people were already seated.



All of them wore gray park ranger uniforms ‚Äî but none of them had name tags.



One woman, the oldest, finally spoke.



  ‚ÄúMr. Price. You‚Äôve been identified as a viable candidate for replacement Sentinel designation. Congratulations.‚Äù



I opened my mouth to protest, but she raised her hand.



  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen it. You‚Äôve heard the pulse. You‚Äôve made contact with the steam-born. You found Ellis. That qualifies you.‚Äù



The others remained silent.



Then she said something I‚Äôll never forget:



  ‚ÄúOld Faithful is not a geyser. It is a vent. A pressure valve for something beneath this basin. Something‚Ä¶ living. Sleeping. Bound. We are not rangers. We are its custodians.‚Äù



 



She pulled out a thick folder and opened it to reveal \*\*a topographic map of the park\*\*, but layered.



Each layer represented a different time period. The oldest went back 12,000 years.



On every layer, the vent was marked. Not as ‚ÄúOld Faithful.‚Äù



But as \*\*‚ÄúThe Throat.‚Äù\*\*



  ‚ÄúThe being beneath this land is not a creature in the traditional sense,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt has no form. Not one we can survive perceiving. But it‚Äôs active. And over millennia, it‚Äôs developed‚Ä¶ sensitivities.‚Äù



  ‚ÄúIt dreams in pulses. Feeds on memory. When the pressure builds too high, it must be vented. If not, it finds other ways to release.‚Äù



I thought of the steam.



The red mist.



The voice in the fog.



I asked what the Sentinels were for.



She said:



  ‚ÄúTo listen. To appease. And to give it what it wants before it wakes up.‚Äù



 



Then she gave me one final thing ‚Äî a tape recorder.



Worn. Old. Labeled in black marker: \*\*‚ÄúSentinel Log #6 ‚Äì Ellis‚Äù\*\*



I played it that night in my cabin.



Static at first.



Then breathing.



Then Ellis‚Äô voice:



  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt guard the park. You guard what‚Äôs under it. You don‚Äôt patrol trails. You patrol its dreams. You think you work here by accident? You were chosen. Every one of us is chosen.‚Äù



Then a pause.



Then his last recorded words:



  ‚ÄúWhen it learns your name, it uses your voice.‚Äù



I shut off the tape.



But the whisper didn‚Äôt stop.



From the back of the room, barely audible:



  ‚ÄúPrice.‚Äù





It started with my ID badge.



The morning after the briefing, I tried to clock in. My keycard didn‚Äôt work. The digital reader blinked red, chirped once, and rejected it.



I went to the front desk.



The admin staffer blinked when I gave her my name. Typed it in. Frowned.



  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one listed under that name, sir.‚Äù



I laughed. Thought she was messing with me.



Then she turned the screen so I could see it.



\*\*No entry. No file. No photo.\*\*



Like I‚Äôd never worked there at all.



 



I rushed to the personnel office. Same story.



They pulled out the ranger roster for the month ‚Äî my name was gone. Even the locker I used had been reassigned. My gear? Cleared out. My boots? Gone. My \*\*cabin\*\*?



Locked.



Someone else was living in it.



 



I tried to text Jim.



No reply.



I tried to call. Straight to voicemail.



I even drove down to the emergency radio tower, pinged his private line on our internal ranger channel. Dead silence.



But twenty minutes later, I found something taped to my windshield again.



A single scrap of paper. Torn at the edges. Three words:



  \*\*‚ÄúThe Throat Remembers.‚Äù\*\*



 



That night, the whisper came again.



From my closet.



From inside my \*mirror\*.



It didn‚Äôt say my name anymore.



It just \*\*breathed\*\*.



Not loud. Not threatening.



Almost... gentle.



Like it was savoring the moment.



 



The next day, I found the word \*\*‚ÄúTHROAT‚Äù\*\* scratched into the inside of my ranger hat.



Then on the underside of my coffee mug.



Then on the mirror in the public restroom by the trailhead ‚Äî fogged into the glass like condensation.



Only I could see it.



And every time I blinked, it was closer.



 



On the seventh day, I walked the lower basin trail and stopped in front of Old Faithful.



It hadn‚Äôt erupted in over an hour. The tourists had mostly cleared out.



Only one man stood near the rope.



Gray hoodie.



Pale skin.



I stepped closer.



He turned.



And he had \*\*my face.\*\*



But older. Worn.



Eyes like glass.



He reached out and touched my shoulder. Whispered:



  ‚ÄúYou are ready now.‚Äù



I tried to pull away ‚Äî but my boots locked in place. The ground \*\*opened\*\* beneath me. The familiar whistle built, but this time it was louder than ever. Like a thousand flutes screaming in unison.



Then steam. Red. Burning. Rising.



Something grabbed my leg.



\*\*Dragged me down.\*\*



 



I woke up underground.



Surrounded by stone. Heat. And breathing walls that pulsed with steam.



In front of me: a \*\*staircase\*\* leading deeper into the crust.



And at the bottom, I swear, something \*\*was waiting\*\*.



Watching.



Smiling without a face.



I don‚Äôt know how far I fell.



The walls weren‚Äôt made of stone anymore. Not exactly. They pulsed, flexed. Not with heat ‚Äî with life. The tunnel beneath Old Faithful wasn‚Äôt carved by water.



It was grown.



I don‚Äôt remember walking. I just remember \*\*moving forward\*\*. My boots gliding across soft ground that steamed with each step. The air down there wasn‚Äôt air. It tasted like copper and mushrooms, like \*\*lungs that didn‚Äôt belong to me\*\* were doing the breathing.



That‚Äôs when I saw it.



A small wooden bench.



Old. Splintered. And sitting on it‚Ä¶ a body.



 



It was Ellis.



Or what was left of him.



His ranger uniform hung like a rag over bone. One eye socket was filled with crystallized ash. His mouth was open, like he‚Äôd been whispering something when he died.



And in his lap ‚Äî a second journal.



This one wasn‚Äôt dated like the first.



It was organized \*\*by name\*\*.



The first page said:



  \*\*SENTINEL VII: PRICE.\*\*

 

  Duties begin: September 23

  First breach: September 29

  Vocal infection complete: October 4

  Full integration: October 7

  Collapse event: October 12

  Casualty projection: 37,000+



My hands trembled.



Those dates were in the future.



But not by much.



 



The next pages weren‚Äôt written in English.



They weren‚Äôt even written in one language ‚Äî just fragments. Phrases. Symbols. Sketches of \*\*faces that didn‚Äôt quite look human\*\*.



Then, near the end, a phrase repeated over and over:



  ‚ÄúThe Throat remembers. The Mouth learns. The Eye will awaken.‚Äù



I dropped the journal.



And that‚Äôs when I heard it.



\*\*Footsteps.\*\*



But not from behind me.



\*\*From inside the wall.\*\*



 



The wall to my left bulged.



A human hand pushed through it ‚Äî thin, gray, translucent skin stretched over finger bones that seemed \*\*too long\*\*. Another arm followed. Then a face pressed into the wall, trying to birth itself forward ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt alive.



It was \*\*me\*\*.



Or a version of me. Mouth open. Skin steaming. Eyes gone. Head tilted.



It whispered, in my voice:



  ‚ÄúYou were always the dream. Not the dreamer.‚Äù



 



I turned and ran.



The tunnel stretched. Bent. The laws of space didn‚Äôt apply anymore. One step forward turned into miles. My radio screamed static. Then hissed:



  ‚ÄúCollapse imminent.‚Äù



 



I emerged at sunrise, crawling from a steam vent fifty yards behind the main visitor center.



Covered in ash.



Bleeding from both ears.



But I was alive.



Or at least, I thought I was.



Until I passed a mirror on the maintenance truck.



And saw \*\*his\*\* eyes looking back at me.



Not mine.



His.



When I got back to the station, no one recognized me.



Not Jim.



Not the admin staff.



Not even the maintenance guy I shared lunch breaks with every Thursday for three years.



  ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said, backing away, ‚Äúthis area‚Äôs restricted to park personnel.‚Äù



I told him my name.



He tilted his head.



Then said, ‚ÄúThat name‚Äôs not on the active roster, sir. You‚Äôll need to leave.‚Äù



I laughed.



Pulled out my wallet, showed him my driver‚Äôs license.



He squinted.



  ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt look like you.‚Äù



But it did. It was me. Same photo. Same face. But when I looked down at the ID‚Ä¶



\*\*The eyes were wrong.\*\*



Too wide. Too‚Ä¶ \*\*curious\*\*.



Like the picture wasn‚Äôt frozen. Like it was watching me back.



 



I drove to Livingston, Montana. Two hours north.



My brother lives there. Or \*lived\*, anyway.



I knocked on his door just after dusk. He answered in pajama pants and a t-shirt, holding a half-finished beer. Looked older than I remembered. Tired.



  ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù he asked.



I told him who I was.



His smile faded.



  ‚ÄúIs this a joke?‚Äù



Then he called for his wife. She came to the door. Looked me up and down. And said:



  ‚ÄúDerek, your brother died in 2017. He fell into a thermal vent at Yellowstone. They never found the body.‚Äù



 



I drove back in silence.



That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.



I listened.



And at exactly \*\*2:09 AM\*\*, I felt it again.



The pulse.



But not from Yellowstone.



This one came from \*\*the east\*\*.



I checked the seismic logs. Sure enough ‚Äî a microquake in Virginia. Centered around a small, defunct geyser field near the Shenandoah Valley.



A place that had been dormant for 12,000 years.



Until now.



 



At 3:00 AM, I got a call.



Unlisted number.



A voice like mine answered, only deeper.



It said:



  ‚ÄúThe Mouth is open. The Sentinels have failed.‚Äù



Then static.



 



The next day, I returned to Yellowstone.



Old Faithful didn‚Äôt erupt.



Not once.



Instead, the ground trembled.



The steam hissed.



And the \*\*faces in the mist\*\* didn‚Äôt fade.



They multiplied.



Dozens of them.



All of them wearing my face.



All of them whispering:



  ‚ÄúYou were never the ranger.

  You were always the vent.‚Äù



I stopped sleeping on October 11th.



Every time I closed my eyes, I fell ‚Äî not into dreams, but into \*\*echoes\*\*. Downward. Always downward. Through steaming corridors made of teeth and memory. Through caves shaped like lungs. Through \*\*my own face\*\*, stretched across walls that inhaled.



Each time, I heard voices.



Not many.



Just one.



Mine.



Speaking \*\*before I could think\*\*. Telling stories I hadn‚Äôt lived yet. Whispering warnings in languages I shouldn‚Äôt know.



But last night, it said something new.



  ‚ÄúYou are not a dreamer anymore. You are the dream. And the Throat no longer sleeps.‚Äù



 



I drove straight to the geyser basin.



Didn‚Äôt stop for clearance. Didn‚Äôt stop when I crossed the restricted boundary. Didn‚Äôt stop when the security lights turned red and the alarms began wailing behind me.



Old Faithful stood still.



Silent.



Waiting.



The ground beneath me wasn‚Äôt solid anymore.



It \*\*flexed\*\*.



And then, just like that ‚Äî the earth \*\*opened.\*\*



Not an eruption.



An \*\*invitation.\*\*



 



I stepped down into the vent.



No resistance.



No heat.



Only \*\*understanding.\*\*



The tunnel was smooth. Glossy. Like the inside of a throat. But it pulsed now ‚Äî not just with heat, but with \*\*intent\*\*. Like it had finally found the words it needed.



Ellis was waiting at the bottom.



Not dead.



Not quite alive, either.



He stood at the edge of a glowing chasm, his body semi-transparent, skin flickering with images ‚Äî maps, faces, symbols.



  ‚ÄúYou thought you were the last,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we are all Sentinels now.‚Äù



 



And then I saw it.



Across the cavern, something stirred.



Not a creature.



Not a god.



Not a thing.



But a \*\*concept given shape\*\*.



It had \*\*faces\*\*, but none of them were real. Just masks worn for our sake. For \*\*comfort\*\*. Behind them: a writhing absence that bent perception like heat over asphalt. Every pulse from Old Faithful had been a \*\*heartbeat\*\*. Every eruption, a \*\*shiver\*\*.



It hadn‚Äôt been contained.



It had been \*\*concentrating\*\*.



Learning.



Practicing how to wake.



And when I saw its eye open ‚Äî a vertical pupil the size of a bus, rotating with colors not meant for daylight ‚Äî I understood the final truth:



  \*\*The geyser wasn‚Äôt keeping something buried. It was feeding something inside us.\*\*



 



All the Sentinels ‚Äî Ellis, the boy in the red hoodie, the nameless rangers, and finally‚Ä¶ me ‚Äî had been \*\*conduits\*\*. We weren‚Äôt protecting the park from it.



We were \*\*helping it remember.\*\*



The more we learned, the more we described, the more it took \*\*form.\*\*



It needed minds.



It needed imagination.



It needed \*narrative.\*



And now?



Now it had enough.



 



I woke up this morning on the side of the road near Gardiner, Montana. No ranger truck. No uniform. Just a handwritten sign next to me, propped up on a rusted shovel.



Five words:



  \*\*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the story now. Speak.‚Äù\*\*



And I am.



Because when I stop speaking ‚Äî when I stop thinking, stop \*writing\* ‚Äî I feel it crawling back up my throat.



And I know the next eruption won‚Äôt be from Yellowstone.



It‚Äôll be from \*\*me.\*\*



And maybe‚Ä¶



\*\*from you.\*\*

The Detroit Tigers‚Äô ace, **Tarik Skubal**, is the game‚Äôs most overhyped prop bet this week. Yes, he‚Äôs a 2024 All-Star, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîhe‚Äôs not a strikeout machine. With a **4.17 xERA** (expected ERA) and a career focus on inducing weak contact over strikeouts, the ""Over 8.5 Ks"" line (-114) is a trap. Fade it. Skubal‚Äôs efficiency (6.3 K/9 this season) isn‚Äôt worth the price tag.

On the other side, **Luis Severino** (4.17 xERA) starts for the A‚Äôs. He‚Äôs not here to dazzle, but his **4.5 K prop** (-105) is even dumber. Severino‚Äôs strikeout rate? A paltry 5.2 K/9. Bet the **Under 4.5 Ks** (-120) and laugh all the way to the bank.

**The Real Winner? The Under 7.5 Runs (-120).**  
Both teams rank in the bottom third of MLB in offensive output. Skubal‚Äôs career ERA against LHP is 3.23, but the A‚Äôs lineup? They‚Äôre 29th in wRC+ (.645). Severino‚Äôs 4.17 xERA vs. righties (the Tigers hit .238 vs. RHP starters) isn‚Äôt inspiring. This game is a snoozer‚Äîbet the **Under 7.5 runs** and enjoy the low-scoring snoozer.

**Prop Pick of the Night:**  
**Skubal Under 8.5 Strikeouts (-114)**. He‚Äôs more of a ""let‚Äôs get out of here quickly"" pitcher than a K-machine.

**Final Score Prediction:** Detroit 3, Oakland 2. A game where ""run support"" means a two-out RBI single.

*Note: If you bet on Skubal to strike out 9+ batters, I hope your coffee is strong. Very strong.* ‚òï‚öæ

I think posts like this can be a little irritating to some people, so feel free to ignore unless you find it interesting! :)

A short while ago, I was offered an opportunity in Liverpool.

I've since had one become available in Belfast as well.

I'm not asking everyone to choose cities for me or anything, but I know Belfast a little better than Liverpool so I'm just seeing if anyone has an insight into the relative pros and cons of both?

I love Belfast for its friendly people, laid back lifestyle, and the nature which is so close to the city.

I also feel like there's an underlying 'indie arts' type buzz, with a good coffee scene, and trad music too... it feels a little bit 'up and coming' and hipster to me.

I also feel really safe there - I'm not involved in the fleg-iness, so that doesn't feel like pressing concern to me. 

I'm a Christian as well, and Belfast's religious overtones might annoy some people but it can feel quite homely to me (even if I don't agree with ALL church stuff that goes on there).

I know Liverpool a tiny bit, and was initially drawn to it because I felt the Irish influence, and it feels like a young, vibrant city - bigger than some, but way smaller than London (which is good, imo).

But yeah - I'm just getting a sense of how those two options might compare to each other.

Any thoughts or opinions would be gratefully received! :)

Thanks everyone",1,1750785495.0,Belfast,2,0.67,False

1ljgzr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ljgzr1/the_divorce_prescription/,The Divorce Prescription:,"# Chapter 1

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much... Sobs...""

Attached was a photo-no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue -and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, "" Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now-a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam-the man she had always loved-she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him

back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.noveldrama

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into

darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate

it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever

you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to

him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd

like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his

heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but...

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery. He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for

you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before-not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't

come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall.

She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a

workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him

seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made

this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened

slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand- washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip. Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be

easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""...Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She

asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out

at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers

as soon as possible.Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?



  
 .

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the [room.no](http://room.no)

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing-no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime

from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without

money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?",1,1750785390.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

This is my first reddit post but I got Bell‚Äôs palsy from mono at the end of May and been lurking around here for a while so figured it was time.

Back to Bell's palsy, I was lucky to get on steroids quickly, but like many of you probably know, recovery takes time, and you have to be consistent with rehab exercises.

This is completely new territory for me, I‚Äôd never even heard of Bell‚Äôs palsy, so I‚Äôve been learning a lot as I go!

One thing that really surprised me was getting a sheet of paper with exercises and just being told to go home and do them.

At first, I used a basic timer app and did the exercises in front of a mirror, but even though my doc told me it was super important, I struggled to find motivation, and I definitely wasn‚Äôt as consistent as I needed to be.

I work in tech and AI, and have been using chatGPT to keep track of my symptoms and been brainstorming how to approach healing etc. it's been really helpful. Has anyone else done this?

But figured I could take it one step further, so I decided to build a simple web app to help myself ‚Äî using a tool called Lovable (a text-to-app builder). I'm pretty proud because it actually works and is live!

It's called **Bells** and now I use it multiple times a day. I'm honestly so proud, didn't think I could figure this out!

What does it do?

* 4 preset sessions
   * (Morning, day, night, and sound-based)
* Front-facing camera view so you can see your face ‚Äî no mirror required
   * (Camera feed is local-only and nothing stored or sent anywhere)
* Timer, exercise titles, and short instructions for each movement
* A little progress tracker to encourage you
* Custom session builder if you‚Äôve got your own routine
* Calendar reminders so you don‚Äôt forget (because... yeah)
* And a simple reward system ‚Äî I give myself a fancy coffee after a few solid days in a row hehe
* Works on your phone, tablet, or computer ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a web link!

So, if you're also going through recovery, I‚Äôd love your help and would appreciate any feedback you might have.

The photo is from a few days ago when using bells, after finishing steroids. I saw a really big difference on like day 9 of meds. So the worst of the paralysis has improved, and I know that‚Äôs not the case for everyone. But rehab must go on!! Sigh.

‚Ä¢ Cassabrews is an investment and is very tempting.
‚Ä¢ Moka pot can become useless if my place doesn't have a gas stove right?
‚Ä¢ There is a chance that I might have to move back to my home country in a year or two if immigration fails and won't be able to carry a Cassabrews. I could resell it at a loss.

1ljgxdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1ljgxdz/to_those_who_also_had_multiple_concussions_what/,"To those who also had multiple concussions, what side effects did yall get long term?","Ive had three diagnosed concussions. One when I was a toddler and fell out of a swing, one when I was 10 or 11 and had an accident involving one of those big metal swings that go on front pourches, and the last one when i was 12 and was in a bad car accident. 


Im 20 now and since I was 16 or 17 ive started getting alot of symptoms which I think are a result of the concussions which are getting worse overtime. Whenever im still I can start to get a sort of ""fuzzy"" sensation in the front of my head accompanied by fatigue and vision issues. They very alot but at its worst the vision issues become actual tunnel vision and I can barely keep my eyes open. This happens regardless of the amount of sleep I've had and the symptoms go away almost entirely when I start moving around again. 


Ive also noticed that caffine can help keep it from happening. But like alot of caffine. That and holding something strong like black coffee in my mouth can also help. ",1,1750785246.0,Concussion,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm writing them in hopes that they help men and women out who may be unaware as to why it‚Äôs happening to them. 

1. *You‚Äôre not asking me questions.* No one wants to have a one way convo with themselves. Asking another person questions implies you‚Äôre interested in getting to know them. I get it maybe you hate small chat, but write down 5 random fun questions and use those throughout. 

2. *You haven‚Äôt asked me out.* There‚Äôs a delicate line‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhen do I ask them out? I don‚Äôt want to scare them.‚Äù And I get this. I think after you‚Äôve had a page to two pages of convos, this is a good time to ask. If you‚Äôre teetering on if it‚Äôs the right time to ask, this is what I would recommend saying. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôd love it if we could have a phone call, or get a coffee. Either of these work for you? If you‚Äôre wanting to stay chatting a bit longer, that also works, let me know.‚Äù

So today there is a heat advisory at the beach, it is currently 96¬∞f outside

I just got back from a bike ride i took after drinking a coffee and an an empty stomach which was a bad idea, by the time i got back to the beach house i was sweating bullets and exhausted

I'm going to rest for a bit then head to the beach and jump in the ocean.

Should i still go out in this extreme heat or should i stay and rest longer?

I would like some opinions, thank you all for your input.

Beacons, choreographed by Anna Sperber, is described by The New York Times as ‚Äúimmediately compelling‚Äù and ‚Äúwonderfully strange,‚Äù exploring themes of movement, connection, and endurance through both youth and aging. Performed by Tim Bendernagel, Owen Prum, Zo Williams, and Sperber, with music by Lea Bertucci and lighting by Madeline Best, it delves into change, support, and the complexities of being present.

Todd is creating minimalist furniture using modern industrial tools, which naturally favor straight lines and right angles, to re-infuse the curves that existed before the wood was milled as lumber. Working with walnut, oak, maple, and southern yellow pine, he builds pieces that attract the hand as well as the eye.

1ljgpti,https://www.reddit.com/r/YourDigitalJourney/comments/1ljgpti/web_hosting_services_for_churches_why_hostinger/,Web Hosting Services for Churches: Why Hostinger is the Perfect Fit,"So, your church is ready to take the next step and build a website. Awesome! But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîchoosing the right web hosting service can feel like picking the right coffee order at a fancy caf√©. Too many options, too many confusing terms, and *what even is a VPS?*

Trust me, I‚Äôve been there. A few years back, my friend‚Äôs small church spent way too much on a hosting plan that was slower than dial-up. After some trial and error (and a *lot* of caffeine), we found **Hostinger Hosting**‚Äîoops, typo! I meant **Hostinger Hosting**‚Äîand it was a game-changer.

In this post, I‚Äôll break down why Hostinger is the best web hosting service for churches, whether you‚Äôre streaming sermons, sharing event calendars, or just keeping the congregation in the loop. Let‚Äôs dive in!

# [üöÄ Ready to Launch Your Church‚Äôs Website? Hostinger‚Äôs Pricing is a Blessing!](https://servicesforneeds.com/hostinger-review-2025-the-best-budget-web-hosting/)

# Why Churches Need Reliable Web Hosting

First things first‚Äîwhy does your church even need a website? Well, unless you‚Äôre still relying on bulletin boards and word-of-mouth (bless you if you are), a website is your digital front door. It‚Äôs where people:

* **Find service times** (because no one remembers if it‚Äôs 9 AM or 10 AM)
* **Watch past sermons** (for those who overslept‚Ä¶ again)
* **Donate online** (because carrying cash is *so* 2005)
* **Stay updated on events** (potluck next week? Yes, please!)

But here‚Äôs the kicker: if your hosting is slow, unreliable, or harder to use than assembling IKEA furniture, your website becomes more frustrating than helpful. And that‚Äôs where Hostinger swoops in like a superhero.

# Hostinger‚Äôs Features That Churches Will Love

# 1. Affordable Pricing (Because Churches Have Budgets)

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîmost churches aren‚Äôt rolling in cash. Between keeping the lights on and funding mission trips, every dollar counts. Hostinger‚Äôs **shared hosting plans start at just $3.99/month** (yes, really).

* **Single Plan**: Perfect for small churches just starting out.
* **Premium Plan**: More power for growing congregations.
* **Business Plan**: Ideal if you‚Äôre streaming sermons weekly.

No hidden fees, no ""surprise!"" renewal rates. Just straightforward pricing that won‚Äôt make your treasurer faint.

# 2. Easy-to-Use Website Builder

Not everyone is a tech wizard. Some of us still struggle with PDFs (no judgment). Hostinger‚Äôs **drag-and-drop website builder** is so simple, even my grandma could use it‚Äîand she still thinks ""the Google"" is a person.

* Pre-made templates (including faith-based designs!)
* One-click WordPress install (if you‚Äôre feeling fancy)
* No coding required (hallelujah!)

# 3. Fast Loading Speeds (No More ""Buffering..."")

Ever tried watching a sermon that buffers every 10 seconds? It‚Äôs like spiritual torture. Hostinger‚Äôs **LiteSpeed servers and SSD storage** make sure your site loads faster than a kid running to Sunday school snacks.

# 4. Free Domain & SSL Certificate

A free domain for the first year? Check. **Free SSL encryption** so hackers don‚Äôt mess with your donation page? Double-check. Hostinger bundles these in, saving you both money and headaches.

# [üöÄ Ready to Launch Your Church‚Äôs Website? Hostinger‚Äôs Pricing is a Blessing!](https://servicesforneeds.com/hostinger-review-2025-the-best-budget-web-hosting/)

# 5. 24/7 Customer Support (Because Tech Issues Don‚Äôt Wait)

Picture this: It‚Äôs Saturday night, and your website crashes before the big Easter service. Panic mode? Nope. Hostinger‚Äôs **live chat support** is available around the clock, and their team actually knows what they‚Äôre doing‚Äîunlike some *other* hosts (*cough* GoDaddy *cough*).

# How Hostinger Stacks Up Against Other Hosting Services

Okay, let‚Äôs play ""Would You Rather"" with hosting providers:

* **Bluehost**: Good, but pricier. Do you *really* want to pay extra for the same features?
* **SiteGround**: Also solid, but their renewal rates hit like a collection plate during a mortgage payment.
* **GoDaddy**: Overpriced and upsells you like a street vendor. Hard pass.

Hostinger? **Affordable, fast, and no-nonsense.** It‚Äôs the Toyota Camry of web hosting‚Äîreliable, efficient, and won‚Äôt break the bank.

# Setting Up Your Church Website with Hostinger (Step-by-Step)

If I‚Äôve convinced you (and I hope I have), here‚Äôs how to get started:

1. **Sign up for a Hostinger plan** (I recommend Premium for most churches).
2. **Pick a domain name** (e.g., *StMarksChurch.org*‚Äîkeep it simple!).
3. **Install WordPress or use the website builder** (whichever feels less scary).
4. **Customize your site** (add service times, a donation button, maybe a photo gallery).
5. **Launch and celebrate** (virtual high-fives all around!).

Pro tip: If you‚Äôre stuck, Hostinger‚Äôs **knowledge base and tutorials** are like having a patient tech-savvy friend on speed dial.

# Final Thoughts: Why Hostinger is a No-Brainer for Churches

In my experience, most churches just want a website that works without draining their budget or requiring a PhD in computer science. Hostinger nails it. It‚Äôs affordable, user-friendly, and packed with features that actually matter.

\-vitamin b1: most bread and cookies are fotified with vitamin b1 anyway (there is a clip of him saying he gave vitamin b1 fortified cookies and it increased learning or something)

\-vitamin a and vitamin d supplementation: most dairy is fortified with vitamin a and d in the US anyway, and if you drink it in the quantities that he suggests, its a great source of vitamin a. It actually has twice the amount of vitamin a than in unfortified milk.

\-vitamin e: mayo is something I've been craving lately, and once I had it, I felt much more mentally there

\-fish oil avoidance: most people don't take fish oil anyway

\-cokes, but made with real sugar (literally just mexican coke)

\-coffee but with tons of sugar (most american coffee is made with tons of sugar, and cream as well) and there is an entire culture of drinking coffee anyway, and most coffee drinks you find have tons of sugar anyway, look at this: [https://www.heb.com/product-detail/starbucks-vanilla-frappuccino-coffee-drink-9-5-oz-bottles/26273](https://www.heb.com/product-detail/starbucks-vanilla-frappuccino-coffee-drink-9-5-oz-bottles/26273)

\-drinking low fat milk (most milk is 2% or at most 3.25%)

\-high sugar diet (american food has loads of sugar in it anyway lol)

\-orange juice (orange juice is a very common grocery item in the us, raypeat himself has said he just drinks regular supermarket orange juice)

\-ice cream (most people love ice cream. There's even a trope of eating ice cream after a breakup)

\-carrot salad and coconut oil usage: probably one of the only things that is genuinely useful (imo) that I learned from raypeat, but I feel like shredding it lengthwise is kind of bull, since youre gonna be chewing it anyway before you swallow

Around a month ago this really cute guy (23-25M?) walked up to me and started asking me about an exercise I was doing. He was pretty jacked so this was surprising to me. The next time I saw him he said he tried the exercise and that it was really good, then asked me for more tips. We ended up introducing ourselves and he asked me where I was from, how long I‚Äôve been going to the gym, etc. He saw me a few days later and was also really chatty, asked me if I had any plans for the night (it was Friday), asked what I do for work, what my split was, if I go to the gym on the weekends. At first I thought he was just a really friendly and outgoing guy who wanted to learn more about lifting, but I‚Äôve never seen him talk to anyone else, just me.

My friends all told me there was a chance this guy was into me, so I decided to make a move. Last Wednesday him and I were talking and at the end of the conversation I straight up just said ""I have a question... are you single?"" He looked a little shocked but he said yes and then asked if I was too. I said yes then he suggested we get a coffee sometime and that he would be out of town this weekend. 

Yesterday morning he walked in and headed straight towards me. I didn‚Äôt even see him because I was looking down at my phone. He waved to get my attention, then he gets all chatty again asking what I did on the weekend. At the end of the conversation I just casually asked ‚Äúhey, did you ever end up texting me?‚Äù And he said no he just had a really busy weekend. I respond that I never meant to make him feel uncomfortable, and he goes ‚Äúno not all at all I‚Äôll hit you up!‚Äù Then he walks away‚Ä¶. Then after I‚Äôm done I say bye to him and he fist bumps me and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you later‚Äù

So he ended up texting me last night. We chatted a bit about our hobbies, he didn‚Äôt mention the coffee again‚Ä¶.. then he stopped replying after my last text. This morning I saw him at the gym and things felt a bit weird. I saw him at a squat rack far away from me but then it seemed like he moved to a squat rack right in front of me for no reason. I saw him in the mirror and waved, he waved back, but he didn‚Äôt take out his headphones and try to talk to me like he usually does. Later on we ran into each other at the water fountain and he asked what I was working today‚Ä¶ that was it. Strictly gym talk, I felt like a bro. As of now he still never responded to my text from last night.

So I guess I‚Äôve been gymzoned. Maybe he was just looking for a friend? Did he ask me for my number and to go out for coffee just to let me down easy? Maybe one of my hobbies offended him so deeply that he ghosted? Just not sure of anything at this point‚Ä¶",1,1750784585.0,dating_advice,13,1.0,False

1ljgjgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1ljgjgk/relocating_to_cyprus_eu_from_usa/,Relocating to Cyprus (EU) from USA,"Hi all,

Long story short, I've accepted a job offer in Cyprus for a number of reasons. I've been doing a good bit of research and think I've got my ducks in a row but it's a quick turnaround, so I want to make sure I've got everything covered and solicit any general advice from those who have relocated abroad from the US. I've numbered my main questions for quick review and put some additional context associated with each.

First things first is getting necessary documentation to my employer since they're sponsoring my work visa. It seems like the main hurdle here, from a timeline perspective, is the criminal background check. I need to have it Apostilled, so that's an added layer.

1) Is it worth using one of the online services to expedite the process, especially for the apostille?

I currently live (renting) in Illinois, which is not ideal from a tax perspective. However, my dad lives in Tennessee which is much more favorable, so I'm looking to change my residency to be there.

2) Any potential issues or complications changing my residency like this?

I plan to maintain US-based banking/brokerage accounts.

3) As long as I maintain a US address, there shouldn't be any problems with this right?

I'm only really taking clothes and some basic kitchenware (pots&pans, knives, blender, coffee machine, etc), so probably only a few boxes and under 100lbs total.

4) what is the best option for getting this stuff over there? I've seen some suggestions of LCL carriers and others of just using USPS international shipping.

I'd like to keep a US phone number for 2FA and whatnot. I currently use Google Fi Unlimited, which will obviously be overkill if only using for text/data. 

5) Is downgrading to basic Google Fi the best option or is something cheaper/better out there?

I've already got other supporting documents (birth certificate, degrees, passport, etc) settled, have a place to stay in Cyprus, and generally feel pretty good about being prepared based on what I know. It's the unknowns that I'm concerned about, so anyone with experience to share around potential gotchas or hurdles to look for would be greatly appreciated!

I'm not sure what prices distributors pay, but each little bottle of keto chill is $7 on autoship. Keto Max is also $7 per serving. The cans are a steal at about $2.50. Mitoplex is $1.50 each. That's not counting taxes and if they have to pay shipping. Some of the ketone packs are cheaper but then she can't upsell if she's not drinking Max herself. But that's almost $20/day if she has those four items daily. More if she had multiple packets instead of a can in there. Oh, and keto creme is $4 to mix in with whatever else.

I can't imagine spending that much on DRINKS that are not much more than caffeine delivery systems. Maybe some people forgo other caffeinated drinks or sodas/seltzer when they have ketones, but still making coffee or tea at home is a fraction of the cost and even coffee shop drinks are probably cheaper (I dunno, I drink tea from home.)

It also could add up to a couple hundred calories depending on combinations, especially if there's a keto creme in there which is 130 by itself. So for these ladies trying to lose weight I doubt they are accurately accounting for the calories in the ketones but rather considering them ""free"".",11,1750784167.0,KelseyRhaeTT,5,1.0,False

In mid October I started feeling some back pain on my upper right side. I thought it was a kidney stone but my US was clear, urine was clear. In late Jan/early Feb I started having these burning gnawing sensations across my upper abdomen. The NP I saw thought it may be pancreatitis so I had labs and an abdominal US done. Everything was normal , they couldn‚Äôt fully see my pancreas or gallbladder but from what they saw they said it was normal. Told me it was gastritis and to start an anti inflammatory diet which I did. In March after reading posts on here I asked my PCP to be tested for h pylori. She said I probably had Celiac disease but agreed on the stool test. It was positive. I did the two week course of antibiotics. The burning pain went away but I still had lingering gnawing pain on the right side that would travel to the middle and into my back. She told me it was gastritis still. This kept going on and in April I went back. She said the same thing. In May I asked for a HIDA scan, she said no. In June I asked for a HIDA scan she finally put it through. My EF is 88%. My pcp called and said everything was normal. I disagreed and asked for a surgical consult. I just went on Friday for my surgical consult and the surgeon said it is absolutely not my gallbladder. That none of my symptoms are gallbladder related, I should get a biopsy then just shrugged his shoulders. He said if it was my gallbladder I would be on the floor for almost an hour in pain constantly. I told him ALL my symptoms and my family history where almost everyone has had their gallbladder taken out and none of them had pain like that. He said again it‚Äôs not my gallbladder. My PCP won‚Äôt give me another surgical consult referral. I‚Äôm going insane now thinking I have gastric cancer. My symptoms on a daily basis are:
Constant ache in my URQ and sometimes ULQ and middle right under my breasts. Mid back pain that travels down and up into shoulders and across my shoulder blades. Random shooting pains that hit so hard I‚Äôll arch my back and I have to wait. Bloating is wild. Stool is normal but I go between constipation (normal for me) and softer stools. No blood in stool. My appetite is normal after the antibiotics but certain foods will make life hell for the day.

1ljg75c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/comments/1ljg75c/getting_started_first_steps_my_experience/,"Getting started, first steps - my experience","Hi! I've been lurking for a few weeks, since I first discovered this group. You are all so friendly, helpful, and encouraging for those of us just getting started with solo roleplaying - thank you!

I've seen lots of posts here from people asking how to get started, all of which have been helpful for me. I thought it might be useful to share my own very recent experience. I'm only a few sessions into my first adventure, so taking those first steps is a very recent experience, and one I wanted to share while it is still fresh. I hope others will add their ""first steps"" stories in the replies.

My desire starting out was to play a published adventure. I tried getting back into D & D with my partner and our son a couple of years ago after not playing since I was a teen many many many years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't click for them (and I probably wasn't a great GM, despite (or maybe because of) my loads of time prepping for sessions). I now had all these resources (I dove in quite deeply quite fast), and I already play solo boardgames, so the idea of solo D & D seemed like it should be possible and fun, but I had no idea how to get started or what that would even look like.

I found a few videos, but none of them gave concrete advice for how to take those first steps, or made it seem too complicated (which I didn't believe *had* to be true). Then I found this group and Trevor's channel, Me, Myself, & Die, and got even more excited about solo roleplaying. In this group I learned about the resources *DM Yourself* and *Mythic Game Master Emulator,* as well as a few others, but those are the ones I went with. Wow! They were both quite intimidating at first! Especially *Mythic* at over 200 pages! And I still wasn't sure what the whole thing would look like. 

I thought it might be useful to use a virtual tabletop for the maps and keeping track of stuff, so I got the Fantasy Grounds version of Death Knight's Squire, loaded it up, created a character, and played through the adventure. It was fun, but not very satisfying - more like a choose your own adventure book, which is not what I was looking for. It also seemed like Fantasy Grounds was not going to work for solo roleplaying - it just wasn't designed for it, and I couldn't find a way to make it work for me.

By chance, I found [a video](https://youtu.be/oQoL81LzjJ8?si=9N5E7XHfVJw-WRlq) that mentioned software designed specifically for solo roleplaying (Sojour) by somebody who originally created it just for himself and insisted his advice for playing solo would work *without* having to use the software. It looked interesting, and at only $10 it seemed worth the gamble. Sojour's designer stressed the importance of writing down your adventures, especially the dialog. I'd seen  people post about doing this, but it seemed like a lot of work, and something I wasn't planning on doing - I'll come back to this.

After trying to read *DM Yourself* and *Mythic GME* again, and still being overwhelmed, I decided to just jump in - to push all the buttons and pull all the levers, a phrase I use to describe my approach to learning new, complex boardgames. I figured if it didn't work, at least I'd have a better idea of what the whole thing looked like, and what I need to learn to make it work. **This turned out to be the best decision I could have made!**

I grabbed my adventure of choice - it doesn't really matter which one, I think this will work with any adventure, or even a ""from scratch"" approach - and downloaded the Sojour software ready to start rolling some dice! Well, I should have realized I would need to set up the software, so I opened the manual and found a tutorial video to get started. It took a bit to get it working, but going through that process helped me see how this solo roleplaying thing would all work. 

So I had the basics of the software set up, I'd created my character, complete with a simple ""parents dead, settlement burned to ground"" backstory (and a sidekick, thanks to advice from the part of *DM Yourself* I managed to get through), and I had my chosen adventure. I realized right away I had to figure out how my PC and sidekick knew each other. I also had to get them to meet the NPC who would give us our first ""assignment"" (get a wagon from one city to another). I started writing. The Sojour software makes it easy (hence the name, short for Solo Journal), but you could easily do it in a notebook, no software needed. 

Once I started writing, I kept going, and even writing the dialog felt natural and easy. I had no idea the whole time what was going to happen next, but somehow whatever I wrote down easily led to what came next (and I don't consider myself to be very creative). The first session took about a half hour not including finding pictures for my character, her sidekick, and the task-giving NPC (to use for map tokens) and a generic tavern map to put them into.

The next morning, over coffee, I sat down with *DM Yourself* determined to get through it. It was much easier this time - I was able to visualize everything the book talked about, I could actually picture myself at my table doing the things in the book. I took notes, made a cheat sheet, and tried another session that afternoon. This time I also learned how to scale the maps and create a ""fog of war"" effect for the maps (so cool!!!), and spent most of my time importing the adventure maps into the software (easy to do from screenshots) while trying not to actually look at what was on them. 

In that session the characters made it two days into their journey - no random events the first day, but the next day the characters met a cheerful gnome selling a new type of sandwich out of his wagon - he called them ""hot pockets"" - probably this world's first food truck! For those of you having a hard time with random tables, this is what came of my 1st try generating a random event from scratch (after a couple of rerolls that didn't fit the ""positive"" requirement). By the end of that session I was surprised by not only how much I had written (and enjoyed doing it!), but also that I had gone through two sessions with no combat, something I wasn't expecting at all! And I'm looking forward to my characters maybe running into Jasper Frostbeard again, he's the gnome with the mobile food stand who invented ""hot pockets"".  :)

I'm now a few sessions in, my characters did eventually run into some goblins (and almost died until I remembered the druid could shape shift), and they are now buried in story threads in the town where they delivered the wagon. I have also made it through a few more pages of the *Mythic* manual, and am finding the page for keeping track of story threads and NPCs quite helpful. I struggle with the tables, but am using some of them, except not the fate chart yet, because I am still intimidated by it, but I'm getting there.

**The tldr summary is to just dive in** **- don't wait until you feel prepared.** Also, don't underestimate the importance of writing everything down - narrating the scenes and writing out all the dialog - it's not as much work as I thought it would be, and has really helped immerse me in the story. I think it has also helped a lot with sparking creativity because it forces me to notice the details of the surroundings, think about the body language and tone of the people talking, and helps me keep track of time (something else the creator of Sojour recommends). 

Every session leads me into what to learn next about how to improve my solo roleplaying sessions. I'm even making it through the *Mythic* manual a few pages at a time, and can see how it will eventually be quite useful. Even though I know I still have a lot to learn to improve my solo rpg experience, I'm having a lot of fun, and look forward to every session - to finding out what will happen next, and how my characters will handle it!

**For those of you who have already taken those first steps,** what did they look like? What tools did you use (if any) in that very first session? What resources did you find helpful before you got started?  Did you try anything that didn't work for you? Have you run into any surprises? How do your roleplaying sessions look now compared to how you thought they would look before you sat down for that first session?

It was another rainy day at Sunny bridge Town. I had constantly wondered who the hell gave that pathetic name to a town where it rains for over 160 days a year. I had been there for six months already, and it was time for me to leave. I was only waiting for the end of the month, so I could get my salary from the Bella Donna Caf√©. It was the 28th of September. I remember that date well because it was the day I met HIM for the first time‚Ä¶ There weren't any customers at the caf√©, so Janette and I were dying from boredom. I had already cleaned up all the tables and wiped the floor twice. ‚ÄúMaybe Donna let us go early today? Who would want to go out when it rains like that?‚Äù Janette asked. ‚ÄúDon't count on it,‚Äù I chuckled, mocking her hopes. ‚ÄúEven if no one comes here for a month, she will gladly find us new places to clean, or she will bring the paint and tell us to change the wall color.‚Äù Janette glared at me and clicked her tongue. ‚ÄúYou're no fun at all, Lilith!‚Äù she hissed. She would probably have hit me with the cloth she was holding in her hand, but the bell sound of the opening door interrupted her. We held our breath, hoping for a customer that would save us from agonizing monotony, someone who would give us a tip, would be even better. Certainly, our hopes were crushed along with the view of our favorite six-year-old twins walking inside the store. ‚ÄúPatrick, Paula‚Ä¶? Why aren't you at school?‚Äù I asked, looking at the twins wearing soaking wet, yellow rainy coats.

‚ÄúThe school was flooded,‚Äù Paula informed, grinning, ‚ÄúWe want Lilith's chocolate muffins!‚Äù

I sighed, shook my head in disbelief, but then smiled. These children were like a ray of sunshine in this

gloomy town. They lived with their parents, just around the corner, and they were our regulars. I

thought that if I missed anything from this place after leaving, it would be those two always grinning faces.

‚ÄúI baked new ones today.‚Äù I winked, corrected the cotton gloves I always wore on my hands and took

out two muffins from the baking sheet. ‚ÄúThese are with white, and raspberry chocolate.‚Äù

The kids started eating them right away. It literally took them five seconds for the muffins to disappear.

‚ÄúWow! It was super yummy, Lilith!‚Äù Patrick called, licking off chocolate from his tiny fingers.

‚ÄúI'm glad you liked it,‚Äù I smiled at them warmly. ‚ÄúNow, run back home. It looks like the rain will only get

heavier‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will, Lilith!‚Äù they both called.

‚ÄúTake care, honeys!‚Äù Jannette waved them goodbye as they were walking out.

‚ÄúBye Janette! Bye Lilith!‚Äù I heard their sweet voices.

I chuckled and hurriedly brought a mop to wipe the wet floor around the door and the counter.

‚ÄúShe should pay you more. Donna, I mean,‚Äù Janette stated lazily leaning against the table by the door.

‚ÄúYes, she should,‚Äù I smirked.

‚ÄúI mean it! If it weren't for your cakes and muffins no one would have come here to drink that coffee

from a machine that is broken every second day,‚Äù she claimed, crossing arms on her chest.

‚ÄúBut it doesn't matter anymore.‚Äù I put away the floor mop and stood beside her to teasingly ruffle her

curly hair. ‚ÄúI'm leaving in two days. I will take my money and leave this town.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?! I mean‚Ä¶ I know this town is a shitty hole, but it was a little less shitty with you here,‚Äù Janette

sulked.

‚ÄúI just really cannot stay in one place for too long‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed.

‚ÄúAre you one of those who try to find their place on Earth, or is somebody chasing you?‚Äù she chuckled.

I laughed nervously trying to hide the fact that she accidentally pointed out my true reason for constant running away. Luckily, she didn't notice my awkward expression.

‚ÄúAnyway, good for you!‚Äù She combed her hair back the way it was, ‚ÄúIt would be a waste if a clever girl

like you stayed here longer. I'm gonna miss you though‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll miss you too,‚Äù I smiled, taking the mop to the back room.

The bell hanging above the door rang again. This time it was Joe and Frank, two locals, who always

dropped by for coffee and pie as soon as they finished their shift guarding the local factory.

‚ÄúIt's raining cats and dogs out there!‚Äù Joe hissed, literally dropping tons of water from his jacket.

‚ÄúFor God's sake, Joe! I've just wiped the floor!‚Äù I called out annoyed, bringing the mop from the back

once more.

‚ÄúI'll do it,‚Äù Jannette offered.

‚ÄúNo. I'll do it. Just give them coffee,‚Äù I grunted.

Joe and Frank smiled awkwardly then bowed apologetically responding to my glare. They sat at the bar

table. Janette quickly brought them two cups and poured them coffee from the pot. Obviously, it was

one of those days when the coffee machine broke again.

I started wiping the floor and then noticed that the bell above the door was tilted on one side. I stood up

on my tiptoes trying to correct it, stretching my hand as much as I could. Suddenly, someone opened

the door, pushing me away, and making me lose my balance.

‚ÄúOh, God! I'm going to fall!‚Äù I thought, shutting my eyes close.

Yet, surprisingly, I didn't fall. I landed in somebody's arms. I carefully opened my eyes and saw an

insanely handsome man with strange silver hair, and glowing, gray eyes. Unlike his hair, his long

lashes were black as night.

‚ÄúAre you my angel‚Ä¶?‚Äù I mumbled, dumbly staring at his incredible face. He smiled faintly and helped me get back on my feet. Only then did I see that, except for having a

handsome face, he was also tall and had a sexy figure. He was wearing a long, black coat with a black

suit underneath. He looked nothing like the locals. He kept looking me up and down in silence until I

came back to my senses.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ I'm s-sorry‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ t-thank you!‚Äù I stuttered like a complete idiot, clearly showing how flustered I

had become.

‚ÄúYou're welcome,‚Äù he replied in a deep, alluring voice.

Then he grabbed his closed umbrella, passed me by, and sat at the table deep in the caf√©. I turned

around to get him a menu from the counter and saw Janette standing still with her mouth wide open.

‚ÄúHe is so hot!‚Äù she whispered, although I wasn't sure if she was discreet enough.

‚ÄúHush! Control yourself‚Ä¶ a little,‚Äù I scolded her nervously taking the card.

‚ÄúCan't help it‚Ä¶ I want to have his baby‚Ä¶ now, if possible,‚Äù she stated staring at him blankly.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I should take his order,‚Äù I muttered and walked to his table.

‚ÄúWhat's with the gloves?‚Äù he suddenly asked looking at my hands.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù I laughed nervously, ‚ÄúIt's just a habit of mine,‚Äù I replied hiding my hands behind my back.

‚ÄúA habit‚Ä¶‚Äù he repeated, smirking.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ can I get for you?‚Äù I asked, trying to quickly change the subject.

‚ÄúCoffee, perhaps?‚Äù he answered, nonchalantly.

‚ÄúI wouldn't recommend it,‚Äù I smiled awkwardly, ‚ÄúOur coffee machine is broken, so we only have the one

from the drip coffee maker, but its taste‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI bet that I'll like the coffee you make,‚Äù he tossed seductively.

I couldn't tell why, but he was making me feverish, and my body shivered every time I glanced into his

bright eyes.

‚ÄúW-why would you say that you'll like my coffee?‚Äù I laughed faintly. ‚ÄúHave you ever tried it before?‚Äù

I gazed curiously at him, trying to recall if I had ever seen him there, but chances for me to forget

someone as peculiar as he were close to zero.

‚ÄúOh, I'm certain I'll like it,‚Äù he chuckled and slightly licked his lip, ‚ÄúI know that, because you smell like‚Ä¶

sunshine.

# Chapter 2

I froze and smiled awkwardly at my silver-haired customer. Throughout my life, I had been learned to

hide my emotions. I had never let my guard down in front of anyone, especially men. I used to stay

unmoved, no matter who that guy was or how he looked, but in front of this person, I felt helpless, as if

he could see right through me. I found it terrifying.

‚ÄúI'll get you a coffee then‚Ä¶‚Äù I turned around towards the counter, ‚ÄúEspresso-kind black?‚Äù I tossed on

my way there.

‚ÄúAs long as you make it,‚Äù he slightly chuckled.

‚ÄúWhat a flirt,‚Äù I muttered annoyed, yet sensing that my face was turning red.

I couldn't understand my reactions. I used to ignore anyone whom I would hear such words from. If I

had a worse day, I would even quickly make him regret that he dared to say a single word to me, but

now‚Ä¶ I kept blushing like an idiot!

I went to the bar, making sure I was turned around the whole time to avoid my peculiar customer's

gaze. For some reason, I was convinced that he kept his eyes on me the entire time. My hands started

to tremble nervously. I took a cup from a shelf, and I almost made it slip and fall on the floor. Luckily, I

was able to catch it at the last second.

‚ÄúWhat is wrong with me today?!‚Äù I asked myself in my head, ‚ÄúConcentrate, Lilith!‚Äù

I gazed at Jannette. I guessed she was too busy chatting with Joe and Frank, constantly refilling their

coffee cups to notice my sudden clumsiness. When she noticed my stare, she chuckled and winked at

me.

‚ÄúGo get him,‚Äù she whispered teasingly glimpsing at the silver-haired.

I took a deep breath and started brewing his coffee. I poured hot water to moisten the paper filter, then put freshly grounded coffee on it, and started making a dark-brown potion. I finished and carried the

cup to my customer's table, consciously avoiding his gaze.

‚ÄúYour coffee, Sir,‚Äù I put the cup in front of him slightly turning my eyes from him.

‚ÄúAm I repulsive to you?‚Äù he asked with his charming voice.

‚ÄúN-not at all!‚Äù I burst out without knowing.

He smirked then looked into my eyes as if he wanted to devour me. I flinched and stepped away from

his table.

‚ÄúThank you for the coffee‚Ä¶ Lilith,‚Äù he smiled courteously, looking at the name tag on my shirt. noveldrama

‚ÄúE-enjoy your coffee‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered hesitantly and walked back behind the counter.

The way he said my name felt strange as if he already knew who I was. Suddenly, I became anxious.

‚ÄúCould he be someone that HE sent to find me? No‚Ä¶ he doesn't smell like them. I've been learning

how to sense them for years‚Ä¶ That silver-haired is not one of them for sure,‚Äù I pondered.

I nervously corrected the gloves on my hands, then took an empty coffee pot from the bar table.

‚ÄúLilith, Jackson asked about you again, y'know? Why don't you give that poor guy a chance,‚Äù Frank

chuckled.

‚ÄúSorry, let's just say that Jackson is not my type,‚Äù I smirked, taking dirtied paper napkins from the bar.

Suddenly, Frank grabbed my wrist.

‚ÄúDon't be like that. If he's not your type, maybe I am?‚Äù he chuckled obnoxiously.

‚ÄúLet go of my hand, Frank. This is not funny,‚Äù I hissed.

‚ÄúCome on, Lilith! You're such a prude. You should have some fun,‚Äù he looked me up and down.

‚ÄúI said no!‚Äù I forcefully pulled my hand out of his grasp.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Frank stood up and tried to reach for my hand bending over the bar table.

I dodged, making him fall onto the bar, knocking off a few glasses and the empty pot I just took away. The glasses shattered on the floor. One of the pieces stabbed my arm. I pressed the injured place in a

panic and froze.

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Frank?!‚Äù Jannette yelled.

She grabbed my bleeding hand and instantly started dragging me towards the shelf with a first aid kit.

‚ÄúI'm sorry! I only wanted her to loosen up a bit‚Ä¶ I didn't mean to‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank freaked out after seeing

blood dripping from my arm.

Janette opened the box and took out the bandage and the patches.

‚ÄúI-I will do it myself!‚Äù I grabbed the kit from Janette's hands and started treating the wound myself.

‚ÄúFine!‚Äù she raised her hands startled by my reaction, ‚ÄúI only wanted to help you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶ but I'd rather do it myself,‚Äù I smiled forcefully.

She stepped back with a grimace on her face and went back to scolding Frank. I patched my hand as

quickly as I could.

‚ÄúGod! Don't let them smell my blood! Please! Don't let them smell my blood!‚Äù I prayed in my mind.

Due to the commotion Frank caused, I completely forgot about my mysterious silver-haired customer.

Somehow, I started thinking that he must have thought of me as a total freak seeing me overly reacting

to a simple cut. I looked at his table, but he wasn't there‚Ä¶

I walked over there, his seat was empty, and all his things were gone. He disappeared without a trace.

It looked like he took merely a single sip of coffee from the cup I brought. There was a hundred-dollar

bill lying on the table by the cup.

‚ÄúGuess he didn't like my coffee after all. At least he is a good tipper‚Ä¶‚Äù I smirked, taking the money.

Janette finally got rid of Frank and Joe, right after she had made them pay for the damage that Frank

caused. They were the last clients we had that day. We spent the rest of our work time wiping the glass off the floor and around the counter. Donna, the ‚Äúlovely‚Äù owner of our caf√©, didn't show up. She just

gave us a call, to close at ten o'clock like we usually did.

I kept thinking about the silver-haired customer. How could he leave the caf√© without any of us

noticing? I was so intrigued that I instantly thought of checking our surveillance camera recording. I told

Janette that I would close the store myself, and as soon as I finished my work, I went to check the

footage. Surprisingly, I found that the one camera showing the area where he sat was broken‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHow odd‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered to myself, ‚ÄúWasn't it repaired just two days ago?‚Äù

It was slightly frustrating, but I was too curious to simply forget about it. I was unable to give a clear

reason why, but I had to see what was recorded on other cameras trying to find a single screenshot of

his face.

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. Why do I even want to see his face again? He looked like he wasn't from around

here, and I will leave this place in two days!‚Äù I mocked my own actions.

Of course, I kept searching for any signs of him on the footage anyway. I found the moment when I had

almost fallen on the floor while he'd been walking through the door. I had seen myself correcting the

tilted bell and‚Ä¶ the picture went black. The black screen stayed for about a minute of the recording,

then some distortion appeared, and the footage went back to normal right after.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù I called, checking it for the third time, ‚ÄúDid he carry some wave disturbing device with

him or something?!‚Äù

I clicked my tongue and groaned displeased, then I finally gave up and turned everything off. I sighed

deeply, took my things from the back room, and walked out to close the caf√©. At least it finally stopped

raining.

I grabbed the keys and unknowingly hung my purse on my injured forearm. I hissed, feeling a stabbing

pain, but the worst thing was that my wound had reopened. My heart started to race. I took off my

jacket and started to wrap it around my bleeding arm. It was too late. The wind already carried the

smell of my blood around. I hurriedly closed the door, feeling how my body started to shiver, then I

walked faster and faster. I prayed that nothing bad would happen, that they hadn't found my trace yet.

A second later, a howling sound confirmed the exact thing I was afraid of. That sound was their calling.

They were gathering. They were getting closer‚Ä¶ They found me. Chapter 3

I thought I saw a wolf-shaped shade just around the corner. I flinched and ran in the opposite direction.

I couldn't believe that the ones who were looking for me got here so fast. It couldn't have been merely

the smell of my blood that betrayed my location. They must have known about it for some time.

‚ÄúCould it be that they were sniffing around the town earlier without me knowing?!‚Äù I wondered in panic.

I had become careless. I had never made such a stupid mistake. I had been fooling them for years, and

yet, I got myself in a situation when I was unprepared.

‚ÄúI need to get home fast. I need to take my survival bag, then get to the train station. After that, I need

to take the money from the deposit box at the station and get the hell out of here,‚Äù I planned in my mind

while running.

Suddenly, I heard a deep growling sound coming from the alley right in front of me. I stopped. I saw

three wolf-shaped shades ominously appearing on the wall of the building. I turned around and saw two

other wolf shades in the alley behind me. I was surrounded. I sighed and tossed my purse onto the

ground. Then I stood in a fighting position and clenched my fists.

‚ÄúFive on one?! That is not very gentlemanly of you!‚Äù I called out.

The wolf-shape shades started to turn into human silhouettes‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWe don't want to hurt you, princess. Not unless you give us a reason,‚Äù the voice coming from the alley

in front of me snarled.

Three men walked out right in front of me. They were all tall and their bodies were filled with muscles. I

gulped and clenched my fists even harder, standing steady on my feet.

‚ÄúJust give up. You won't fight us all,‚Äù I heard from the man who just came from the back alley.

They were coming closer, sneering, and looking me up and down with disdain. I took a deep breath.

‚ÄúCalm down, Lilith. You have to calm down. Aim for the vital spots. You can do it. You can fight them

and run away,‚Äù I talked to myself.

They stood in a circle around me. I kept glancing at all of them, turning around and waiting for the first  one to attack.

‚ÄúLook, princess. We don't have to entertain you. Surrender and go quietly.‚Äù The one that resembled the

strongest one reached out his hand my way, painting a sneering smile.

I used that opportunity to grab his arm and throw him to the ground using his own strength against him.

He moaned painfully.

‚ÄúHow dare you lowly human!‚Äù another one roared and came right at me.

Fortunately, his fist wasn't fast enough to hit me. I dodged the punch. Then I hit his chin with the base

of my palm and aimed for his eyes. He bellowed in fury. There were two down and three more to go.

The next one attacked me from behind. I used my hands and elbows to release myself from his grip,

then turned around and hit his solar plexus. I knew that if I were to survive, I had to move even faster.

As soon as he bent down, I passed him by and started running away. Two others started chasing me. I

used all of my strength to speed up. I clenched my teeth, telling myself that I had to escape from them.

I briefly turned my head around to check my distance from them. There was a slight chance that they

wouldn't catch up quickly. I smirked and sped up even more. I knew I had to get around the corner.

There was an old, abandoned building there. It was a perfect place to hide. I ran straight, clenching my

fists. I was getting closer. Only a few more steps and I would reach the building.

Suddenly, a tall, red-haired man appeared right in front of me. He smiled wickedly while spreading his

arms wide and blocking my way. I recognized him right away.

‚ÄúNo! Only not him!‚Äù I screamed inside my mind.

I jumped to the side, frantically trying to find some other route to escape, but he was much faster than

those other men chasing me.

‚ÄúWhere do you think you are going, princess?!‚Äù he hissed grabbing me by the collar. noveldrama

His grip was so strong it almost made me choke. He pulled me back and tossed me to the ground. I

jumped up on my feet. My only chance was to attack him and run. He was too tall for me to aim at his

face, and my kicks might not have been strong and fast enough to damage him. I clenched my teeth hit his stomach, and quickly jumped back. He only chuckled, while I felt as if I had broken my hand. I

turned around, hoping for a chance to run away from him, but the other men were already there. I was

surrounded.

‚ÄúGive up, princess. If you choose to resist, I will have to break a few bones in your pretty body,‚Äù the red-

haired chuckled coldly.

I panted heavily. No matter how hard I trained my body over the twenty years of my life, I was still not

even nearly a match for them. My human body was at its limit, but surrendering wasn't an option.

‚ÄúNot a chance, Derek. If you want me, you will have to kill me!‚Äù I roared, standing again in a fighting

position.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ don't say I didn't warn you,‚Äù he smirked, then nodded his head telling the men behind me to

attack.

Two of them grabbed my arms, trying to restrain me. I stomped on one's foot and kicked the other's

legs out. I thought that it was my chance. I had to use it and escape at any cost. I barged straight

ahead, but then Derek blocked my way. He swiftly grabbed my neck and lifted me up. I couldn't

breathe. I struggled, trying to release myself from his hand that clenched my throat. I grabbed it with

both of my hands, but I couldn't even lift one finger of his palm. I tried using my legs to kick him, but the

lack of oxygen in my lungs quickly cut all of my strength. He laughed, waiting for me to stop resisting.

Tears started to flow from my eyes. I didn't want to give up. I couldn't give up. I couldn't win either‚Ä¶

I gazed straight into Derek's eyes. I wanted to let him know how much I despised him before I couldn't

move anymore, feeling how life was slowly floating out of my body. He finally released his grip, tossing

me down to the ground. I started coughing and desperately trying to fill my lungs again. He crouched

right beside me.

‚ÄúIf you haven't been this valuable, I would have killed you a long time ago,‚Äù he whispered to my ear.

I kept lying on the ground struggling to catch my breath. I couldn't force myself to stand up, even

though I fiercely tried. Derek took out a syringe from his pocket and took off the needle cover with his teeth.

‚ÄúI won't risk your rebellious moves, princess. You are going to get some nice sleep while we're on our

way,‚Äù he snickered, injecting my neck.

I tried to pull out the needle, but it was too late. The drug started circulating in my veins. It hurt. I felt as

if my whole skin had started to burn. I lifted my head.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ son of a b\*tch‚Ä¶‚Äù I hissed faintly, covering the injected spot.

‚ÄúSuch vulgar language, your highness?‚Äù Derek mocked me, ‚ÄúI will make sure to crash your arrogance

very soon.‚Äù

Instantly my legs became weak. I could barely move a muscle. Even so, I still struggled to lift my upper

body with my arms, as if it could allow me to improve my desperate situation. I just needed to do

something‚Ä¶

Those vicious men came to grab me by my arms and started to drag me towards a back alley. The

focus of my sight was decreasing. I felt as if my world had become darker. My head was spinning.

‚ÄúLet me go‚Ä¶ Release me‚Ä¶ Help‚Ä¶ Somebody, help‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered, ineptly trying to strengthen up my

voice.

Suddenly, I noticed a black shadow moving fast. It passed by the men who were dragging me and

disappeared at the corner of an old building.

‚ÄúStupid mutts,‚Äù an ominous voice laughed.

I lifted my eyes to look ahead and saw the shape of a man in a long black coat. The high collar of his

coat was standing, covering most of his face.

‚ÄúWho the hell are you?!‚Äù Derek fumed.

‚ÄúYou don't need to know that,‚Äù the man chuckled.

‚ÄúGet out of here if you know what's good for you!‚Äù one of Derek's men snarled.

‚ÄúCan't do that.‚Äù The man in the coat walked closer, smirking.

Derek's man rushed towards the man in the coat. He jumped up with a kick, but the coat man grabbed

his leg with one hand and broke it.

‚ÄúYou are dead!‚Äù Derek bellowed in fury.

The man in the coat walked closer into the light. Only then, I was able to notice his shining, silver hair. It

was the man I met at the caf√©! I gasped.

‚ÄúYou cannot kill me,‚Äù he sighed nonchalantly, then put on a malicious grin on his face, ‚ÄúI am already

dead‚Ä¶

1ljg3gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ljg3gj/breakfast_for_early_mornings/,Breakfast for early mornings,"Hi all, I've got a question regarding breakfast.

For context:

* I'm visiting Japan for the first time in mid Nov, going to Kyoto and Osaka.
* I'm not naturally an early riser, so to wake up at the crack of dawn to get to popular spots before the hordes arrive, having a coffee is a must.
* I'm a breakfast person and need to eat something before starting my day, especially if it involves a ton of walking.
* All my accommodations are booked without breakfast for flexibility reasons.
* I'm aware of the culture of not eating while walking, the difficulty in finding trash cans, and the general advice to consume food at the location you bought it and throwing the trash there.

Based on the above, I suddenly had a mental image of myself standing outside a konbini at 6AM every morning in the dark freezing cold inhaling an egg sando while scalding my hand and throat downing a hot coffee before rushing to catch the bus/train.

1. Is this what people do when they want an early start? Or is it better to buy konbini food the night before, keep it in the hotel fridge and eat it cold in the room before heading out? (still doesn‚Äôt solve the coffee issue though)
2. Is there a reason why people eat outside the konbini instead of inside? Is it lack of space or other reasons? Genuine question, as many Family Marts in my country (Malaysia) usually have a bench and tiny tables so people can eat inside.",5,1750783356.0,JapanTravelTips,26,0.78,False

This resulted in us having an extremely deep bond as we had no one else to be around or talk to except each other, and we went through a lot of difficult moments through this time period which solidified us in each others lives. 
  However throughout all of this I‚Äôve never been able to shake the feeling of a consistent lack of effort or not having my needs met in this relationship. In the beginning he did so much in terms of romantic gestures, wrote me poems, letters, etc. but I swear over the course of our relationship he‚Äôs never paid for more than 5 meals for us. He‚Äôll occasionally get me a coffee or something but that is so few and far between. Understandably we are broke college students but at the same time we‚Äôre living at home and I always splurge on him . We also are partially long distance so in the beginning I was ubering up to his area every weekend, which when I calculated the total cost it ended up being almost 2 grand. Then he got his license, and he complained about having to drive down to my house. 
  Beyond that, one time he was staying at his grandparents house while they were out of town and he left me there to hangout with his mom for 4 hours while he rehearsed with his band, despite the fact he could‚Äôve ABSOLUTELY brought me. And for our three year anniversary I set up a whole home cooked meal, bought glassware and napkins and roses and lit a candle- he got me a letter and a $5 bouquet from the market. When it comes to my birthdays, he doesn‚Äôt get me thoughtful gifts at all, he gets me ‚Äúutilities.‚Äù I would love to get something catered to my interests, to show he knows me, but instead he gives me flashlights or pocket knives or a Starbucks gift card. For his birthday this year I took him to a concert, bought him his favorite pizza & wings, and booked him time at a studio to rehearse with his band. 
  I feel like there‚Äôs been moments of equality where he puts effort in but I‚Äôve said over and over ‚Äúplease get me flowers:) it‚Äôd make me happy‚Äù and he never has, and that reflects a lot of the dynamic. I just don‚Äôt feel seen or heard at all in our relationship. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a good person, he has a sweet heart, he supports my passions and cares for me, he does drive down every weekend and offer me gas money, but it feels like he drops the ball in other aspects. I don‚Äôt know if I want to live my whole life feeling like my needs aren‚Äôt being met, and honestly I just haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy his company lately because of the resentment I feel, where everything he does annoys me . Even for our anniversary the other day we did go on a trip together, but for gifts he literally regifted me a box of chocolates he was going to give to his friend for his birthday but never did. I feel like he gives me gifts and treats me how he wants to be treated, not how I would want to be treated as a woman, and maybe I‚Äôve fallen into that trap and give him the ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù treatment.

In comparison, this year, Robertson has also named five debutants in his squad to take on [France](https://www.rugbypass.com/teams/france/) in a three-match home Test series starting in early July.

Those five uncapped players are [Du‚ÄôPlessis Kirifi](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/duplessis-kirifi/), [Fabian Holland](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/fabian-holland/), [Timoci Tavatavanawai](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/timoci-tavatavanawai/), [Brodie McAlister](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/brodie-mcalister/) and [Ollie Norris](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/ollie-norris/), who have been trusted in Robertson‚Äôs initial 33-man squad with two additional injury cover replacements.

Kirifi, who was was the captain of the [All Blacks XV](https://www.rugbypass.com/teams/all-blacks-xv/) in 2024, says the call-up is a special moment for him and his family.

‚ÄúI was just at home getting ready to watch my partner play netball, and got the call from Razor, so yeah, pretty special moment and I guess I‚Äôm very lucky to make some cool phone calls after that to Mum and Dad and my partner,‚Äù Kirifi told the *Sky Sport Breakdown* crew after the squad announcement.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a special day today.‚Äù

Former All Black [James Parsons](https://www.rugbypass.com/players/james-parsons/) asked Kirifi what the message was from the All Blacks coaching group at the beginning of Super Rugby Pacific, regarding what he needed to do to be in the national selection frame.

‚ÄúJust to be more consistent, be a reliable teammate and someone who‚Äôs physical on both sides of the ball.

‚ÄúSo, yeah, pretty simple and I have just tried to be as effective as possible as the weeks went on and I‚Äôm pretty proud of my season.‚Äù

Fij-born Tavatavanawai has been a standout for the [Highlanders](https://www.rugbypass.com/teams/highlanders/) this season in [Super Rugby Pacific](https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/) and was the co-captain of the Dunedin-based franchise this season.

Tavatavanawai, who missed the initial phone call from Robertson yesterday, was stoked to be able to let his family know about the good news.

‚ÄúI was just by myself, I missed a call at the start, then I saw the message, had to call Razor back and I was just by myself, doing some gardening at home,‚Äù Tavatavanawai told Laura McGoldrick from *Sky Sport*.

‚ÄúThen my partner who was working during the moment, and she‚Äôs trying to leave work, and I told her just to stay away, we will see each other after that.

‚ÄúThen I made a call to my family that look after me here in New Zealand, I called them and caught up with them for a coffee, it was pretty awesome.‚Äù

Netherlands-born Holland was speechless after finding out the special news yesterday.

‚ÄúI got a call from Razor and was just gonna go out for breakfast to see my foster family, with my Mum, and my brother, and my Mum flew over from the [Netherlands](https://www.rugbypass.com/teams/netherlands/) coincidentally and then as I was just about to sit on the couch, we got a phone call,‚Äù Holland said.

‚ÄúFrom there on, I‚Äôm pretty sure I blacked out for a wee bit there and the only thing I could really say was yeah I‚Äôm speechless man.

‚ÄúAfter that, it was really emotional, having all my family there and calling my old man and sister back home, so it was pretty special.‚Äù

Standing at 2.04m, the Highlanders lock explained that it means everything to him, after moving to [New Zealand](https://www.rugbypass.com/teams/new-zealand/) to chase his rugby dream.

‚ÄúYeah, it means everything, I left when I was 16, my brother and sister were about both 13, so I‚Äôve been here for six years now.

‚ÄúAll the sacrifice from coming over to this moment is pretty special, I think that‚Äôs what all the emotion was about, as soon as I heard it.""

I'd love some recommendations on my trip coming up! I love historical sites, lots of walking, good food and wine. Some of the ones I'm traveling with like more relaxed days for week 1.  
\- September 27th to October 11th 2025. Flying into and out of Rome.

\- Week 1 is a group, me and 3 others.

\- Week 2 is just me!

On Day 1 we plan to recover from jet lag and walk around Rome a bit. I've been before for \~4 days so this is mostly so the others can see a bit of the historical sites.

Days 2-5 in Bologna. Explore the city for a couple days and then do two days trips to Modena and Venice.

Days 6-8 in Florence. Again, explore the city for a couple days, maybe a day trip to Pisa?

Day 9 the group leaves and I head down to Naples. explore the city a bit.

Day 10 do a food tour and a tour of underground Naples.

Day 11 day trip to Pompeii and Sorrento

Day 12 day trip to Herculaneum and to hike on Mt Vesuvius

Day 13 day trip to Procida. Possibly stay the night for a relaxed visit.

Day 14 relax and explore Procida if I stayed or Naples. Then back to Rome.

Day 15 fly home in the AM.

So main things I wanted to ask:

\- does this itinerary look good? Too cramped or too sparse?

\- Is there somewhere I should go other than Procida? I'll be by myself and want to make sure I'm somewhere relatively tourist friendly so I can communicate with everyone.

\- any suggestions on things to see and places/areas to stay would be appreciated as well!

also if anyone wanted to meet up in week 2 around Naples I would love some coffee or dinner meetups. ",2,1750783086.0,ItalyTravel,6,1.0,False
1ljfygi,https://www.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1ljfygi/mar_tour_review_amazing_guides_iffy_management/,"Mar tour review: Amazing guides, iffy management","Got back from a 7-day Machame route + 3 day safari last week after summiting on the 14th, and I thought I'd share my experiences and a review of [Mar Tours](https://martoursandsafaris.com/)

**Tl;DR**: Everyone that brought us around (guides, cook, porters, airport shuttle, safari driver) were extremely knowedgeable, helpful, hardworking, and generally great to be around. The company manager (Job) was often unprofessional though, which made the planning process stressful and caused issues.

**Rundown**:

We flew Ethiopian air Toronto -> Addis Ababa -> Kilimanjaro, arriving on June 7th. Would reccomend if a major city by you has this option; they have multiple daily flights addis -> kili if there's a delay, and the service was quite good (much better than any other Canada/US airline I've been on). Got picked up at the airport by some people who work for Mar and brought to Bristol cottages in Moshi. I'd recommend staying 2 nights before the trip in case you have a delay, and also to relax so you're not rushed. The hotel is nice too, food is good and there's a pool.

On the sunday we just talked to the driver about what's available to do and he took us to a coffe & waterfall tour and hot springs, I'd reccomend if you have a day to just talk to the company and see if they can drive you around to see stuff!

Started the trek monday, here was our experience each day:

1. Drive to Machame gate, get everything sorted out, then start. There's a good amount of distance and elevation gain this day; however, the altitude isn't bad (camp is under 10k feet) so it's basically a difficult hike. I made the mistake of putting my heavy shell in my porter bag and just bringing a thin rain shell; we were hiking through the rainforest and it rained the entire day
2. The weather cleared up and it was a pretty good day. Decent distance and uphill, but it was through a nice forest with some great viewpoints. Didn't put sufficient sunscreen on though, so my neck and ears got very burnt. Everyone in the group got minor headaches at the camp due to the altitude, but these went away by the morning. From this night on, the nights got very cold - had to sleep in  my down jacket for warmth
3. Trek high, sleep low. We went up to the lava tower camp (4600m) to have lunch, then back down to the barranco camp. Getting to the lava tower everyone in the group started to feel really bad due to the altitude - low energy, strong headaches, lack of apetite; overall, it was tough. But getting back down to Barranco and resting there helped.
4. Barranco wall day. This was by far my favourite, we went up the wall which was semi challenging (some scrambling), but wasn't too bad and was very fun overall. Weather was cool but not cold, and the distance was moderate
5. Very short day to hike to the base camp, just a couple hours and not too difficult. Mainly preparing for summit night
6. Summit night. We slept the day before around 5 then woke up at 11 PM, starting the summit push around midnight. This was incredibly difficult, the altitude really hit us hard. Hard to stop often to rest, as even just walking made us short of breath and our hearts were pounding. It was cold, but not too bad, so the layers we packed were fine (and a porter brought up hot ginger tea which was very nice). Took around 7.5 hours to summit, watching the sunrise was beautiful. Went down to the camp, had a snack, then rested for a few hours. Went down most of the mountain to a much lower camp (4 hours) so we could sleep better
7. Easiest day, we just hiked a few hours out, got our certificates, then got dropped back in Moshi

After staying the night in Moshi, we did the 3 day safari:

1. Lake Manyara National Park: Forested area by a lake. Got to see plenty of elephants, lots of monkeys, giraffes, and some birds. Good intro to the safari. Stayed at Eileen's Trees Inn both nights; nice hotel with good food and ameneities
2. Ngorongoro Conservation Area: Best day of the safari by far, we drove to a massive crater filled with wildlife. Saw tons of animals: multiple lions, plenty of antelopes/zebra/buffalo/wildbeast, hippos, and even a black Rhino! (less than 300 exist in Tanzania)
3. Tarangire National Park: Larger park with more semi-open fields. Saw plenty of wildlife, but mainy Zebras and giraffes

If I went back, I would do just the two-day safari since by the second day we'd seen essentially everything

**Reviews**:

**Kilimanjaro crew**: Everyone in the group was extremely helpful. Our guide had summited 50 times, and the assistant guide had summited 60 times. Overall very knowledgeable and helpful for advice on temperature control and keeping healthy (every night from day 2 they checked our O2 levels, blood pressure, and other symptoms). The porters worked very hard as well, setting up the camps quickly and providing whatever was necessary (like filtering water all the time). The cook provided great meals, there was always more than enough to go around and was quite tasty (especially the zucchini soup üòã). One porter came around each morning to wake us up and provide a warm cup of coffee or tea which was very nice.

**Pickup/dropoff**: Our airport pickup and dropoff was very helpful too. He was quite knowedgeable about the area and gave us good advice about local customs, incredibly helpful. Bringing us around on the sunday was fun as well, showing us cool areas was a great start to the trip.

**Safari driver**: Very nice and helpful. He'd been doing the safaris for 16 years so knew pretty much everything about every animal, it was amazing to see all the heard of animals and he'd tell us all the interesting facts about them and answer any questions. Overall a great guy.

**Company owner**: This is where we had some issues. If you email the company, Job will respond with information. The problem is although he responds quickly, he often sends minimal information, ignores questions, or response passive aggressively:

* Kept ignoring requests to confirm the hotel until I directly said I really needed the info for my visa application; ended up only getting the visa approved while stading in line at the airport which was quite stressful
* I asked a question and he responded ""I already said that!', despite not mentioning it at all in the previous email (could have just politely responded)
* Didn't provide much information, just copy/pasted an outdated unclear guide in the email. Had to constantly ask for clarification (\~35 emails total), rely on other sources and generally be stressed due to unclear information. Making a clear guide on your website with FAQ would be very helpful
* Directly lied about the amount of people on the tour to get us to confirm early, stating it was almost full. This by itself isn't great, but when we arrived it turned out there was only 1/3 of the people we expected, making us significantly short on tips despite bringing extra cash. The tips are for the whole group, not per person, so we had to take out more cash than expected, which ended up being an extra $500 over budget since the ATMs there charged a large fee. Very unprofessional to blatantly lie, especially when this means the price is much higher and we had to budget extra time and stress to sort it out because he couldn't be bothered to tell us how many people there were until the day before we left
* Overall seemed very money-based and didn't put as much effort into customers, just handed us the bill when we arrived and said bye when we paid it. I understand this is a small local company and you're not going to have the same resources as a company like Altezza, but at least putting some effort into customer service would be good

Overall, 5/5 for all the crew, but 2/5 for Job

**Advice**

**Hardest parts**:

1. Altitude. Do not underestimate the altitude. I'd only been to \~9,000 ft before so the summit especially was incredibly difficult; I couldn't get enough oxygen to move faster than a slow walk. When the guides say Pole Pole, listen!
2. Temperature swings. After the first day, the termperature changed very quicky when the sun came up and went down. On day 4 for example, whe nwe got to camp we were sweating in the tent in shorts, trying to cool down with water bladders on our necks. As soon as the sun went down though, it got freezing and we needed full down jackets just to eat dinner in the tent.
3. Sunburn. The sun in the daytime is very intense, focus on covering up as much of your body as possible with light clothes or you'll get sunburn

**Tips**:

* A good shell works every day. I brought a non-insulated gore tex shell which worked very well for rain, sun cover, and wind fine - even in the daytime it protects from the sun without making you too hot
* Don't underestimate the cold: I saw someone who just had a fleece, base layer and rain jackaet, had to turn back fairly early when it started to get cold. Also use the hot water + nalgene trick: if you get cold at night, before you go to bed put hot water in a nalgene and keep it in your sleeping bag, works like a charm
* Avoid sleeping pills. My friend had really bad sleeps when he took unisom, I felt really bad on summit night when I took gravol before. Depends on the person of course but I'd say avoid meds if you don't need them
* Bring a medkit with a bit of everything: tylenol, advil, pepto, band-aids, etc were all very useful on the trek and it didn't take up much space or weight
* Bring high-calorie tasty snacks (e.g. Reese's Cups) so you can eat them when your appetite goes down at higher altitudes
* Consider not having meat or other easily spoilable mats after the first day on the trek to avoid stomach issues
* Get the private toilet! The public ones are extremely disgusting (I've camped many times and never seen ones this bad before). Whatever it costs, rent it!
* Chat and have fun! The camps especially you have time each night, it's good to socialize to keep your spirits up",2,1750783035.0,kilimanjaro,2,1.0,False

I ran down the stairs as screams filled my ears and terror flooded my veins. I sprinted to the front door of the pack house and flung it open‚Äî revealing rogues and pack members everywhere tackling, biting, ripping, and killing each other. My eyes squeezed shut, and my hands plugged my ears, praying that this was not real. After taking a few deep breaths I peeled them open again, but nothing has changed, and I began to panic. With only one thing on my mind, I was now determined to fight with everything I had.

Sprinting across the open field, no one noticed me; they were too busy fighting, killing. I made my way through the endless trees searching for my siblings. I don't understand; they should have been in the pack house with me. How could they have been so foolish to leave?

Hiding behind a thick tree, I heard someone coming near. I peeked out from behind the bark; it was Stella's wolf.

""Stella!"" I harshly called as I motioned for my sister.

Her wolf's eyes went wide when she saw me, filled with pure terror and regret. She shook her head frantically, and tears slid down her face. All of a sudden another wolf tackled her, teeth ripping into her throat in a flash.

""Stella! Stella no!"" I cried as her lifeless body laid limp on the forest floor. Prying my eyes off her, I couldn't make myself look for any longer. My sister, she's gone forever.

The wolf that attacked her turned towards me with pure evil and rage in its eyes. With no brake to even mourn the loss of my siblings, they started running towards me, and I waited for the impact with my eyes shut. I waited for my death as a weak wolf would, yet it never came.

Taking the chance, I looked to see the wolf that killed my sister now fighting with one of the pack guards. I didn't think twice and ran deeper into the woods. My sister's cold, dead eyes fogged my brain,

making it impossible to stay focused. What am I supposed to do? How am I expected to tell everyone? I could barely take the aching pain in my heart as it slowly ate at my soul, but I kept running as tears fell down my cheeks, staining the dirt beneath my feet.

I came up to more rogues battling and quickly hid behind another tree. With a racing heart, I peeked out yet again and briefly glanced at the lifeless wolves on the floor. That's until I stopped breathing and became motionless. Oh, goddess. No, please.

My mother laid on the forest floor slain next to my brother, their bodies ripped to pieces, my eyes stung with endless salty tears. I wanted to scream; I wanted to go out there and rip every single one of those damn rogues to pieces. They take my sister, my brother, and my best friend; my mom‚Äîmy mother! How dare they do this to me and get away with it! What have I done to deserve this? 

My heart jerked, and I couldn't breathe. Why? Why couldn't they take me instead!

I wake up covered in a thin layer of sweat with tears rolling down my flushed cheeks. I have this dream almost every night. I'm used to the sweat and tears, but the memories will never fade. My brain is forever tattooed with the images of their dead bodies. Over the past months, I've tried to forget about it all, but I wouldn't make it that easy for myself.

I peel the covers off my sticky body and head to my bathroom to take a shower. Stripping off my pajamas, I switch the shower on and step under the downpour. I relax as the hot water streams down my shaken body, almost as if it's washing away the visuals of my constant dreaming.

I wish I could just forget about the attack, but I can't accept that my family is gone. I found out after the attack that my father was also killed; his life meaning nothing to his murderer. The pack fell apart after the loss of their Alpha and Luna, but they will get over it, I never will.

I turn the shower off and dry my dripping body with a white, fluffy towel from the silver rack. I wrap it around my chilled frame and walk back into my room, glancing at the clock resting on my bedside

table. It is five o'clock in the morning, so I might as well just stay up.

I trudge into my closet and sift through my clothes, scavenging for something comfortable and warm. I decided on a pair of sweatpants and one of my brother's old t-shirts that I wear constantly; it still smells like him in some ways.

Heading downstairs and into the kitchen, my stomach rumbles with the desire to be fed. So, giving in, I open the fridge and grab three eggs from the carton. Turning back around, I have a minor heart attack as Frank seems to appear out of nowhere, sitting on one of the counter stools. Glaring at the three eggs now splattered onto the floor, I internally groan.

""Jesus Frank you scared the crap out of me!""

""You're up early."" Frank casually ignores my frustration as continues to sip on his coffee. Frank is like my personal guard; he lives in the pack house with me, so I am not alone. He's been there for me since the attack and loss of my family, him now being the only family I have left.

""I had a nightmare and decided not to go back to sleep,"" I explain while cleaning up the mess on the white tile floor tiredly.

**Chapter 2**

""Sorry about the eggs.""

""It's not your fault. I just get scared easily I guess."" I throw the paper towel covered in egg yolks into the garbage and turn back to Frank. ""What's up?"" I ask, leaning on the counter.

""Anna, the pack, is going under, people are joining new packs, even becoming rogue. I don't know how much longer we can go without an Alpha or Luna. There's barely anyone left.""

I stay quiet, absorbing the non-surprising information. People are going rogue? Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

""How many are left exactly?"" I question, curious.

""Around thirty.""

""Then what's the point, let's just close down the pack, give up.""

""Are you crazy! Your grandparents built this pack on their own!"" He shouts, taken back by my disturbing decision. ""How can you just throw that all away?""

""Three-fourths of our people died in the attack almost a year ago, and the ones that survived are leaving,"" I say calmly. ""You said it yourself; the pack is going under.""

Frank sighs and rests his head on the counter. ""Where will the thirty of us go?"" He lifts his gaze to me.

""We can join another pack nearby, don't get me wrong it kills me to make this decision, but we don't have a lot of options left.I spoke to the Alpha of the Moon Stone pack over the phone since they're the closest pack to us. He said that he would be happy to let us join his pack, my father made strong allies with the Moon Stone Pack and I'm thankful for that. My father always knew to have more allies than enemies.

The pack house was cleared out, and everything was placed boxes for storage. It was weird to see the place I have grown up in without pictures on the walls, or any signs of my family at all.

I've been thinking a lot about joining the new pack or becoming rogue. At first, I figured I was crazy to think I could become rogue and survive alone, but now it's all I want to do, to be free. I could travel the country, go to places I never got the chance to go because of the pack. Pretending to be a human just sounds like my best shot at a real life.

Of course, I didn't tell Frank about my plans because if I did, I'd get locked in a cell so that I couldn't leave him. So I decide to escape when we arrive at the new pack and head south to California. Having a fresh start will be good for me, maybe I will forget about the gory attack that haunts me every day. Forget about how I lost everything.

""We're here."" Frank nudges me as we pull up to the Moon Stone pack house, glancing out the window I examine the white mansion before me. It's quite fancy, surrounded by green grass and trimmed bushes. Soon we get out of the car and make our way up the front steps and towards the grand looking doors. I pushed on the doorbell and heard the chime sound on the other side of the walls.

It didn't take long for someone to answer.

It was a tall, lean guy; I sensed power radiating off him, he must be the Beta.

""Oh, your here, I'll take you to the Alpha and Luna."" We followed him into the pack house and down a hallway till we came up to white double doors. He pushed them open revealing the Alpha at his desk and the Luna sitting on one of the couches off to the side of the room.

""Ah, you have arrived, welcome."" He motioned us to come in and take a seat. Entering into the dark- colored room, I sat down on one of the leather chairs in front of his desk as he ordered.

""Thank you so much for letting us join your pack, especially under these conditions."" Frank thanked while I just continued to study the room. My eyes landed on the Luna, she was pregnant, at least seven months. Like many people say she had a certain glow around her like joy and happiness took over her soul.

""Congratulations,"" I say to her trying to focus on the present and not my escape plan.

""Oh thank you."" She sweetly smiled. ""Only two more months. When we finished discussing joining the pack and other details they showed us where we would be staying. It's a lovely house, close to the pack house. The inside is spacious and modern, especially the kitchen which I adore.

When they left to give us privacy to unpack, I went upstairs and picked out my room, well more like a hotel room.

I sat down on the edge of the bed in the middle of the room, after I finished bringing my suitcases upstairs. Getting up, I sat on the floor in front of my bag.

Lazily unzipping it, I lifted the top, inside was my packed duffle bag full of clothes, food, water, and other essentials. I pre-packed so I would be ready to go and not waste any more time.

There was a light knock at the bedroom door, and I quickly zipped the suitcase back up and answered it.

""How do you like things?"" Frank asked, leaning on the door frame.

""It's nice,"" I answer abruptly and rather awkwardly.

Giving me a funny look, Frank rolled his eyes. ""Okay well, I'm going to go take a shower. Don't destroy anything.""

Huffing at his stupidity, I shut the door in his face and got back to work.

Dear Frank,

I appreciate the friendship and comfort you provided me with throughout the years. I would like to thank you for taking care of me when I lost my family, you were there for me, and I'll never forget that. I have decided to leave and become rogue. I need to be free and replace my bad memories with happy ones. I'll never forget you.

Thank you,

Anna.

I didn't want it to sound too emotional and risk him coming after me.

Carefully placing the note on the bed's soft comforter, I grabbed my duffel bag and turned to the window.

It's time to go.

# Chapter 3

I quietly closed the front door and turned to face the forest, also known as my new beginning. The deep dark abyss of the woods during the night always gives me the creeps, but there isn't enough time to waste cowering over it. Hesitantly, I made my way down the porch steps and the driveway. I walked along the dirt road until I came to the forest line, I took a deep breath and walked into the dark city of green. noveldrama

After a couple boring minutes of walking, I decided to shift into my wolf to speed up the journey. I set down my duffel bag and stripped off my clothes; I didn't want to rip them like most careless people. Placing my clothes inside the duffel bag, I shifted into my golden brown wolf, just like my mother‚Äôs. I picked up the bag and carried it in my mouth before continuing deeper into the woods, heading South.

After about two more interminable hours I was exhausted, I guess that's what I get when I leave at ten o'clock. Prancing up to a soft brush of bushes under a giant tree, I curled up under the foliage and relaxed my aching body. I peered up at the full moon, high in the sky with stars scattered around it, my eyes slowly shut and soon enough I drifted off to sleep.

\~‚Ä¢\~

My eyes fluttered open, and I was greeted by large trees, jade bushes, aged rocks, and a girl about my age... Wait, what. Immediately I got up, shaking the leaves and dirt off my wolf, ready to defend myself.

""Can you shift back?"" She asked politely.

First I thought this is just a plan and she's going to attack me, but scanning her carefully I noted a few things. She has nothing with her, she doesn't seem like much of a fighter, and she has Alpha blood. I could sense her power as soon as I calmed down.

I nodded and grabbed my duffel bag going behind the tree that doubled as my temporary bed. Shifting, I put my clothes back on and walked out.

The girl was now sitting on a medium sized boulder, but when she saw I was done, she jumped off the rock and came closer.

""I'm Katy."" She held out her hand, and I shook it.

""I'm Anna,"" I stated nervously, what was she doing in the middle of the woods? What if I crossed on her land?

""So what are you doing out here?"" She asked curiously.

Uh, I was just about to ask you that."" I countered raising an eyebrow.

""I'm on my way to Blood Moon pack, just farther South."" Her arm stretched out and not surprisingly pointed South.

""Oh. I'm going to California."" Picking up my duffel bag, I decided that it's better to keep moving.

""We're going the same way; I'm going to Oregon.""

""Oh yeah, I guess so."" I nodded and started to walk.

""Why don't we walk together, we're almost at the Washington, Oregon border?"" She asked with puppy dogs eyes. ""I've had a lonely trip.""

Amused by how charismatic she is I smiled. ""Sure why not."" She did seem kind of cool, and having company would have been nice. She had long Blond hair cascading down her back and bright blue eyes, making my dull brown hair seem boring.

But we started walking and got to know each other.

""So are you from Washington?"" She asked looking up at me.

""Yeah.""

""Are you a rogue?"" I could hear the regret in her voice, but I didn't mind her question.

""I guess, I left my pack last night."" I sigh, I wonder how Frank is doing. Hopefully, he understands why I made this decision, I mean I already made a friend which is a good sign.

""Why did you leave?"" She asked curiously. I glanced down at my feet and took a deep reassuring breath.

""Oh I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me.""

""No it's okay, my pack got attacked almost a year ago killing most of us, and the pack was going under so we split up, and I decided to become rogue. I wanted to be free."" I lightheartedly explained, ignoring the gruesome details.

""Oh, I'm so sorry about your pack.""

""Thanks."" I continue to watch the dirt and leaves covering the forest floor. ""So what about you, why are you out here and not at your pack?"" I ask, changing the subject.

""My bossy brother the Alpha-"" She said in a funny voice. ""- made me go and talk to the Alpha of Moon Stone about some alliance."" She says in a bored tone.

I'm surprised I didn't see her while she was at Moon Stone, well I was only there for an hour at the most.

""So don't you have family or a mate that you're supposed to be with?"" She asks looking up at me again.

""Oh um, my family died in the attack, and I haven't found my mate,"" I mumble, so much for no gruesome details.

""Oh. I'm so sorry."" She peers down at the floor, apparently thinking she hurt me.

""No, it's fine, it happened a while ago."" I brush it off like nothing, even though it was. Who knew a couple of months, was as long as a while.

""So have you found your mate?"" I ask trying to lighten up the conversation.

""No, but it's not that big of a deal."" She shrugs. ""How old are you?""

""Nineteen.""

""Oh, then you should find him soon."" She smiles.

We kept walking for about two more hours until we reached the border, we kept walking after that for at least another hour talking about her pack and school, even though I graduated last school year. I learned that she loves to sing, so I told her how I loved to dance. I've been dancing since I was five, it took my mind off pack business and rogue issues. When I was eight, I got into ballet and stuck with it since, but I stopped dancing after the rogue attack, I'm probably pretty rusty.

""Oh, the Blood Moon territory border is just up ahead."" Katy motioned further ahead. It was getting dark out, so I checked my watch, it's eight o'clock. We kept strolling until a man came into view. 

# Chapter 4

""Come on; they don't bite."" Katy chuckled. I followed her up to the tall, muscular, intimidating man and started to get a bad feeling.

""Hey, Mikey I'm back!"" She calls to him, his face softened, but when he saw me, he became alarmed. Katy noticed and rolled her eyes.

""She's my friend, and we're just going to the pack house.""

""Katy I better go-""

""No I won't let you sleep in those creepy woods, plus there have been rogue sightings close by."" She argued. I just sighed, but I am a rogue.

""I don't want to be a burden.""

""Hey, I could use some company, it's not like my brother will paint nails and do each other's hair with me!"" She whined dramatically, using it to her advantage.

""If it's not too much trouble...""

""It's not now come on!"" She grabbed my arm and dragged me towards a big mansion-like house, which I'm guessing is their pack house. We hurried inside and into a living room with comfy-looking white couches and a big flat screen tv. She pushed me down on one of the couches, and I snuck into the plush cushions. Katy turned on the TV; we watched Friends and Full House for a while. She was laying down on the couch next to me and laughing hard whenever something funny was said during the shows. I decided to loosen up and laugh along with her, she noticed and turned around smiling at me. Talk about an instant friendship.

We continued watching TV and laughing our butts off until someone interrupted our giggling fest.

""Katy who‚Äôs your friend?""

We turned around to see a muscular guy with shaggy dirty blonde hair.

""That's Jackson, our Beta,"" Katy informed me not caring about what Jackson asked her.......

* Coffee comes out much more slowly than before (more than twice as much time is needed)
* Coffee comes out fluffier than before, but every few seconds a large clump will come out in addition to the continuous flow
* Tamping compresses it smaller than it was before for the same weight

I'm not sure if I'm just still too fine, or if this has entirely changed the way the coffee is being ground. Anyone else have similar experiences? I was thinking I'm way too fine now, but the water still gets through the puck in the usual amount of time (about 25 seconds).

I've been struggling with everything from my family, health, school, job to even making or keeping friends, especially during the last few years.

To start off, my family has always been narcissistic and waving off all problems that weren't their own. Every time i opened up or struggled, they ignored it, insulted me and changed the topic to how hard they have it all, so they've been the opposite of helpful ever since i can remember.

I had pretty good final grades, but due to very bad stress and pressure tolerance i decided to ditch midway HS at 18, then lost or quit 2 jobs in following years. After not having insurance but needing medical help, i signed up to a job office..No offers, all applications left on read or refused. I'm going back to try an Adult HS this year, but i'm so traumatized from my past school experiences i've been having nightmares and panic attacks about going back there. Sadly, without HS finished i'm stuck only fit for jobs i will definitely struggle in and get fired from again and again.

I tried seeking professional help but with therapists or psychologists i felt more like i'm being interrogated and prescribed expensive medicine rather than helped.

I've been depressed and that ""quiet and outcasted"" type of person ever since i remember, i always preferred being alone, reading books, listening to music or making art.
Fantasy worlds were my escape and now they're my only form of ""company"" or ""peace"".
To be fair right now i'm living through years i wouldn't even imagine getting to when i was in my early teens.

Most of the friends i've had through last years i've met on online games. (With school classmates i got along, but the second we were out of school, none of the sides kept contact.) A lot of people were wholesome and sweet at first, then proved the most delusional and actually unhealthy to be around. So they either left on their own after i didn't give them what they wanted, or i cut them off.

I had a few genuinely nice people i considered friends, but beside plain talks or gaming together, i can't open up to them about anything serious or more complex (i got into philosophy, psychology and studying art and animation lately, so whenever i bring those up, even they leave me on read and ""don't really know what to say"", sometimes even plain telling me to ""just stop"" or saying ""they're tired of me and i'm being too much"" when i get on monologuing about colour theory or googling best coffee pod machines the second they mentioned needing one.)
To the latter i also noticed i've always played the role of a free therapist whenever they had issues, but whenever i needed support i was left alone.

I noticed that the most, when i fell ill last winter. From flu and cold with fever, then lung complications after...And none of my ""friends"" even messaged me to check up on me for weeks.

On top of it all, another blow was my health issues and medicine making me gain a bunch of weight, bringing my already low self-confidence even lower, and mobility issues from another injury preventing me from even leaving home easily.

Litres of tears later i realised..I'm alone. And only person i could rely on and relate to...is myself and only myself.
So..i feel like the whole world is against me, and only true company i have is my own. But it gets hecking lonely after so long.

1ljfixf,https://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1ljfixf/just_moved_into_a_new_apartmentrambling_post_lol/,"Just moved into a new apartment....rambling post, lol","I've known for over a year that I would be moving, and spent that year, in part, trying to find a new place I could afford -- the rent just got too high in the old apt. Thankfully I was able to find a great place in a brand new building, in a really nice town (same town as my family, and only about 20 minutes from my old place) for a very good rent, via an affordable housing program. So huge *whew!* there, and a thank you to God or the universe or whatever. 

The old apartment was a two-bedroom; it's essentially half of an old 1940s house which was turned into two apts. It has vintage charm, but also the minor issues -- both practical and cosmetic -- to be expected of an old house. It has a huge kitchen, and a really big walk-in closet in the living room (which I *wish* the new place had! There's not much storage space here, just a smallish coat closet). 

The new apartment is a one-bedroom, but the living room, bedroom, and bathroom are quite a decent, biggish size (the bathroom is about 3 times the size of the one in the old place). 

The new place is overall about the same size as the old place (maybe slightly smaller), just configured differently. Because it's new, it's clean and modern, all new appliances, soft-close kitchen cabinets, etc. Not a *luxury* place, but *really* nice. üòä The kitchen is a semi-separate room, essentially divided from the living room by an L-shaped half wall. It's a decent size, but only about half the size of my old kitchen, and with fewer cabinets, so that's a bit difficult.

Because I had such a long lead-time, over the past year I've gotten rid of a *lot* of stuff (mostly donated to the local thrift shop), and over the past few weeks and months I got even more rigorous about getting rid of stuff -- I've always found moving house to be an *excellent* motivator in that regard, lol. I gave a *bunch* of vintage stuff to a guy who lives on my sister's street, and who sells at flea markets. I'm getting rid of my big vintage dining table and chairs (they're still in the old apt.), as there's just no room for them in the new place.

Luckily the terms of my lease allowed me two free weeks, so I paid for rent beginning for July, but was able to start moving into the new apartment in mid-June, and I paid the rent on the old place through the end of June, so that allowed me to actually move my stuff over the course of two weeks, which has been a *lifesaver*. My sister, BIL, and I started bringing over carloads of my boxed-up stuff to the new apt. beginning about a week and a half ago, and this past Saturday we rented a U-Haul and moved all my furniture in, as well as some more boxes (*just* before the heatwave struck, though now I'm still having to bring stuff in from my car in this heat, ugh). I do still have stuff in my car, and stuff temporarily in my sister's garage -- until I can get some of the stuff currently in my apartment unpacked and put away, there's just not enough room to bring the rest of my stuff over.

SO, that's my long-winded way of explaining the situation, and to then say HOW DO I STILL HAVE SO MUCH STUFF?!?? ü§™ I *think* most of my kitchen stuff will fit in the kitchen (I'm unpacking and setting up the kitchen now). The bedroom is mostly set up, although I do still have to hang my clothes in the closet, which is thankfully quite large, about 6 feet long (the dressers with clothes in them are already in the bedroom, the bed is set up, etc. -- I've been sleeping here in the new place since Saturday night). In the living room -- the couch and loveseat are set up, and the coffee table, TV stand, and a couple of bookcases, but there are still a lot of boxes in there. I am going to get rid of a couple of smaller furniture pieces I brought over, as it turns out they're just too much.

Anyway, as I said in my title, I'm just sort of rambling. I needed a break from the unpacking and putting away, and so I thought I'd post. My experience also goes to show that even when you're good at decluttering, you can *still* end up with too much stuff!

Wish me luck, I'm going back in....ü§£",14,1750782074.0,declutter,8,0.9,False

1ljfhnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1ljfhnl/he_was_too_tired_to_install_the_air_conditioning/,He was too tired to install the air conditioning,"We live in an old building that has no central air which means we are 100% dependent on box units during the summer.

We're in the thick of a terrible heatwave. High yesterday was 97 with a real feel of 108. Today it's already 93 and feeling like 105. On top of that the humidity is like breathing soup.

My husband works in an office which is airconditioned. My daughter is watched by her grandparents who have central air. I work from home- and it's the type of WFH job that I can't take to a library or coffee shop because I'm in meetings all day. The cherry on top is that my home office is this little after thought of a room that has no ceiling fan and became the junk room so there's not even space for a box fan.

My FIL has offered to come over a few times and help install the AC but my husband always tells him that he'll ""call him later when he's ready."" He never called. He took the day off yesterday and spend the whole time in our room because it's in the lower level and 15 degrees cooler. He had our baby sleep in our room because the upstairs (where her room and my office are) was too hot. 

So now I'm cooking to death alone in my own home trying to get work done in conditions that they warn you to not leave the young, elderly, and pets in. I guess my safety and well being just wasn't enough of a motivator for him. His advice was ""just take a cold shower every day.""",22,1750781995.0,breakingmom,6,1.0,False
