i've had constipation issues for as long as i can remember. im 19 now and in college, and the dining options definitely aren't helping. every day for breakfast i have coffee with miralax and homemade baked oats and granola that are PACKED with chia and flax seeds. i've been trying to eat more fibrous foods, but i still am struggling. yesterday, i went to the doctor for an unrelated reason (arthritis), and they took an x-ray and said ""well. we noticed you have a lot of excess stool, and that's probably putting lots of weight on your hip"". GIRL. i'm literally doing all i can, and i'm still full of shit.

today, i had my normal breakfast with an extra 2 tbs of flax seeds. i've been trying to stay away from dairy and high carb diets, and i think i've been eating well the past week. i just had my second cup of coffee with miralax today, and i STILL HAVEN'T POOPED. i've taken gas-x, too, because i'm terribly bloated.

i exercise almost every day, drink LOTS of water, and track my diet. i get a decent amount of sleep, too. basically, i'm following everything i've been told, but alas, i cannot shit. does anyone have any advice for what to do? i'm honestly feeling hopeless.

TLDR: i've done everything by the book and still cannot take a crap for the life of me. what the hell do i do?",1,1727899011.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Did you know that Negranti Creamery was the first creamery in the United States to use 100% sheep‚Äôs milk ice cream at both the wholesale and retail levels? Pretty cool for a company that originated on the Central Coast that now has shops in multiple states. This is why I was excited that I no longer have to drive to Tin City to have Negranti, now that they‚Äôve open up a new scoop shop in town. 



Setting:

üìç871 Froom Ranch Way Suite 120, San Luis Obispo, CA 93405

Negranti Creamery is located in the new SLO Ranch Farms shopping plaza, next to Pardon My French. Inside are a couple tables, a fridge with to-go pints and such, and the classic ice cream scoop display/ordering bar. Negranti Creamery is open Sunday ‚Äì Monday 11:30 AM ‚Äì 5 PM, Tuesday ‚Äì Thursday 11:30 AM ‚Äì 7 PM, & Friday ‚Äì Saturday 11:30 AM ‚Äì 9 PM.

What I Had:

I had a Flight of 4 Flavors with Seasonal(?) Flavor Cinnamon Honey Apricot Crisp, Salted Brown Butter, Blueberry Lavender, and Thai Tea, served with 2 waffle cone ‚Äúchips. Let‚Äôs start with the sheep‚Äôs milk ice cream itself, while sheep‚Äôs milk is a richer, fattier milk than cow‚Äôs milk, it somehow creates a fluffier and lighter ice cream. The Cinnamon Honey Apricot Crisp hits with warm spices and strong cinnamon with chunks of a cobbler/crisp in it that does a great job tasting like an apricot crisp a la mode. Salted Brown Butter gives a little tang balanced out with sweetness, which I think comes from the salted part of the butter ‚Äì heightening the sweet and creamy by contrasting it with the salt and browned flavors. Blueberry Lavender was my favorite, it was quite refreshing with the lavender hitting forward and finishing with a blueberry flavor. Finally, Thai Tea was (obviously) tea forward with a cool orange color speckled with black specs that does taste like a Thai Tea (shocking, I know). The Waffle Cone chips were a nice touch, helping to add some extra structure and waffle cone flavor to the experience. My only note is that the glass tasters the scoops were served in didn‚Äôt allow for scooping out of easily once the ice cream started to melt, which was almost immediately. 



Would I Have It Again:

Heck yeah! Especially with it being 100 degrees the next few days, ice cream is going to hit the spot, plus I want to get a crew together to take on the Ice Cream Nachos. The staff was really nice and accommodating, and the place is really sleek and modern while scratching that nostalgic itch for ice cream parlors of your memories.

I'm **44 years old**, lift weights daily as well, and I've **lost over 20 lbs of body fat** while maintaining most, if not all my muscle mass.  I'm in the best shape of my life and feel great!  Please feel free to ask me anything, but here are some tips/trick/strategies to help you on your journey.

**1.** **Don‚Äôt just set a daily step goal, but also set a daily step minimum.**¬† There needs to be a North Star you are working toward, but there also has to be a number that you look at and say, ‚ÄúOk!  No less than this number is unacceptable.‚Äù¬† For example, set a daily step goal of 12k, but start with a daily step minimum of 8k.¬† 8k is that number that, ‚ÄúHey, if I don‚Äôt achieve at least that, I am going to go for a walk at 9pm if I have to in order to achieve it.‚Äù¬† And over time, as you find it easier and easier to hit those minimums and exceed those goals, bump them up from 8k and 12k to 10k and 14k.¬† There always has to be a number we are striving toward, but also a number that we are not going to accept less than.¬† This leaves comfortable room in the middle for life and circumstances to happen while allowing you the flexibility to respond to it.

**2. Buy a fitness tracker!**¬† If you already have a Fitbit or an Apple Watch you are good to go.¬† If you don‚Äôt however, you don‚Äôt make a huge investment in one.¬† There are many wrist fitness trackers on Amazon rated very high with 4.5 stars and up for as low as $25-$40.¬† That‚Äôs all you need to spend in the beginning.¬† There are many videos on YT where people have done amazing jobs comparing some of the lowest priced and some of the highest priced fitness trackers and step counters vs. one another and time and time again it proves that all of these trackers reporter within 2-3% up or down from one another.¬† In most scientific research, that falls within that category of ‚Äústatistically insignificant.‚Äù

¬†You really need it for the data.¬† Imagine trying to make decisions at work with no data of what‚Äôs working, or plan your finances with no information about how much money is coming in and going out.¬† You simply need the inputs of how many steps is this activity vs this one if I do it for this amount of time so you can plan and budget.¬† And equally if not more important, it comes down to the psychology science of it all too.¬† How can you hold yourself accountable to a minimum or an outcome, and how can you feel inspired and accomplished by achieving that outcome if you have no ability to measure the success or failure of it?

**3. Block out at least 30-60 minutes each day for a dedicated walk.** My advice?¬† Own the morning!¬† Mornings are great because they‚Äôre truly the only time you can control.¬† If you leave your walk for the evening, who knows what can happen during the day to stand in the way of that.¬† Control what you can control and nothing great comes without some sacrifice.¬† Whatever time you wake up now, start waking up 45mins to 1 hour earlier and fit a 30-60 minute walk in.

**4. This one is most important!  You need to work walking into the everyday daily things, obligations, and responsibilities you‚Äôre already doing.**¬† The average person does not remotely understand how sedentary they are and how many opportunities for movement and activity they have available to them right here and now today.

* Telephone calls ‚Äì I do a bunch of calls every day for work.¬† While many of them require me to be on camera, or on Zoom, many others do not.¬† Any call I have during the day, business, personal, or in the middle, I take the call on a committed walk, or at minimum while pacing around my office, my living room, or my yard.¬† Every week my wife talks on the phone at some point with her mother, her sister, and her childhood best friend who is like a sister to her.¬† I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate with that.¬† What are you doing while taking the calls today?¬† If you‚Äôre sitting down for any of them, take them on the move.¬† The conversation is the same and just as meaningful, for walk the calls are just as productive, but they are now improving your fitness, health, and wellness.
* This one is my personal favorite!¬† How many of you, multiple times per week each week, have to take your kid to sports practice, or karate class, or dance class?¬† If the class is an hour long, I doubt you drive there, drop them off, drive all the way home, just to turn around 30 mins later to drive there again to pick them up and drive back home again.¬† If you are, that is tremendously inefficient.¬† No, I bet the majority of you are sitting down and watching practice.¬† Or sitting down on some bleachers, in a chair, or in your car watching Netflix or scrolling social media?¬† Get up and walk during that hour!¬† You can still watch Netflix while walking, you can still scroll social media while walking.¬† You can put on a podcast, you can answer work emails.¬† But just don‚Äôt sit there doing nothing while you do nothing.¬† Do something while you do nothing and walk!
* Are you a college student?¬† I was in college.¬† I know how it is.¬† Sometimes you have 1, 2, even 3 hours between classes. Hopefully you‚Äôre using some of that time to study and get some work done and be productive.¬† But I GUARANTEE you‚Äôre also spending some or most of that time on TikTok, Instagram, or Netflix.¬† Cool!¬† I‚Äôm not telling you not to.¬† I don‚Äôt have anything against social media.¬† I love social media.¬† But scroll TikTok while walking the campus and being active.
* Are you an hourly worker who works shifts?¬† I believe it‚Äôs law that you get a minimum of a 15 minute break per shift, and another 30-60 minutes for a lunch break or meal break.¬† What are you doing with those breaks right now?¬† Are you sitting for the overwhelming duration of them scrolling social media?¬† You know what I‚Äôm going to say.¬† Still scroll social media. But put some headphones in and do it while on an easy, low pace walk.¬† You‚Äôll get to consume the same funny and viral content you would have otherwise done, but I guarantee you the short walk will make you feel more energized upon returning to work.
* Then there‚Äôs even the super small things that add up.¬† Running to the grocery store, the bank, the gym, or the mall?¬† Park in the furthest away parking spot rather than doing all you can to get the absolute closest spot possible as if you were Cinderella and your car was going to turn back into a pumpkin if you didn‚Äôt get the absolute closest spot you could.
* Live or work in apartment ¬†or office buildings ‚Ä¶ take the stairs rather than the elevator.
* Have a couple thousand square foot house?¬† Walk to the furthest bathroom every time you have to go.
* At the gym?¬† Cool!¬† This is already supposed to be the most active part of you day anyway.¬† Most lifting programs anyone follow call for a minimum of 1.5-2 mins rest between sets.¬† Take a lap around the gym floor or hop on the treadmill and walk for those 90 seconds or two mins.¬† Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre doing 4 sets of 4 different exercises that day.¬† That‚Äôs 16 total sets.¬† Walk for 2 mins on the treadmill rather than just standing around scrolling your phone and that‚Äôs 32 mins of extra walking and 3,800+ steps right there when you otherwise would have just been standing or sitting around even during a period that is supposed to be your most active.

The opportunities are everywhere!

**5. Get others involved!**

* Got friends to hang out with or reconnect with?¬† Cool!¬† There are so many things you can that are leisurely, and fun, and active, that aren‚Äôt meeting up at a bar, winery, coffee shop.¬† Go on a hike, go to a farmers‚Äô market, go to a zoo or museum.
* Got a significant other?¬† A husband, a wife, a boyfriend, a girlfriend.¬† Awesome!¬† This is a big one!¬† Go on walks together.¬† With your busy schedule, or his or her busy schedule, how often do you two actually get time to spend meaningful, active time with one another just talking and communicating?¬† Catching up with one another on one another‚Äôs day?¬† Especially if you have kids!¬† We all know how stressful being mom and dad can be, and you aren‚Äôt always showing your significant other your best self in the madness of being mom and dad.¬† Reconnect on a daily, couple time per week, or even a weekly walk where you can just be husband and wife.
* Speaking of kids!¬† Play with your kids!¬† Got baby age kids?¬† Put them in a stroller and go for a walk.  Smaller kids like 3-8?¬† Take them to a park and run around and actively play with them.  Older kids 10 and up?¬† Play a sport with them.¬† Go play 1:1 basketball, play tennis or pickleball together.¬† That sport seems to be taking over the earth.  All these things allow you to build a ton of daily activity and steps into your day and build better connections with those around you and those most important to you.
* Have a dog?¬† Does ‚Äútaking your dog for a walk‚Äù normally consist of you bringing them outside to their favorite little patch of grass out front, allowing them to pee or drop what they must and then immediately turning around and going back in the house?¬† I‚Äôm sure that sounds familiar to many of you.¬† It did for me for a long time.¬† Take that dog for a walk!¬† It doesn‚Äôt have to be a 30 or 60 minute excursion.¬† Even an easy 7-10 minute walk multiple times per day will do wonders for you and be great for the dog.¬† How many times do you walk that dog per day?¬† 4?¬† 5?¬† Even on the lowest side that is an additional 28-35 mins of walking which is equivalent to about 3,600 steps.¬† Imagine the impact that could have for you and your 4-legged friend!
* On weekends, take the dog to a big open field and throw a ball or frisbee with them for 30 mins, but don‚Äôt just stand there.¬† As you throw the ball and the dog chases, follow them.¬† Or simply walk laps around the exterior of the field the entire time the dog fetches.¬† He or she will bring the ball back to the new whichever new place you are on the walk.¬† You throw it again and now you both got 30 minutes of much needed exercise and activity in.
* Or lastly, join a walking group.¬† I‚Äôm sure with some basic internet or Facebook research you can find one in your area

**6. Buy a walking pad or be willing to pace around your house and not feel like crazy person.**

* Let‚Äôs talk walking pads first.¬† Cause I am going to expose myself when we talk about the house walking.
* Walking pads are awesome!¬† There are so many on Amazon with high 4-star ratings that are very reasonably priced.¬† I‚Äôm talking ratings as high as 4.8 out of 5 stars, on hundreds or thousands of reviews, for as little as $99-$129.¬† It‚Äôs worth every penny!¬† I suggest getting one that is capable of doing even moderate inclines.
* You can set it up under a standing desk to get in steps while working, you can set it up in front of the TV to get steps in while watching TV or Netflix, if it‚Äôs too hot, too rainy, too cold, too dark, too dangerous to walk outside where you live, you can get steps in right in the comfort and convenience of your own house.¬† This is great for phone calls where you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to leave the house or just micro moments you have when you have 5-10 mins to get some steps in but don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt leave the house.
* Only thing I‚Äôd say is be careful of width.¬† Get the one you prefer, in your price range, with high ratings, that is the widest you can.
* For a smaller person, like anyone under 170 pounds or so I‚Äôm confident nearly any of the high rated one will be perfect.¬† If you‚Äôre a bigger, wider built person like me, with wide hips and wide feet, I found myself ever so slightly changing my walking gate while on the walking pad because it was a bit narrow for me.¬† But for someone like my wife who is 130 something pounds, it was perfect and more than wide enough.¬† So if you‚Äôre a bigger person, be mindful of that.
* Now let‚Äôs talk about walking around the house.  I have two amazing ‚Äúwalking paths‚Äù in my house.¬† I have an open kitchen-to-living room setup in my house that makes for a perfect circular track for me to take a lap around the living room, right up and through the kitchen, back through the living room with never having to break stride.¬† I love it!
* When my wife is in the kitchen, or house in general, she hates it!¬† It stresses her out to see my doing laps around the two main rooms of our house.
* When she‚Äôs in there, I have another track in the master bedroom that allows me to walk down a long hallway, loop around the bedroom, back down the hall, back around to the bedroom, wash, rinse, repeat.
* My wife busts my chops, my kids bust my chops, they imitate me pacing around in a mocking way, but I don‚Äôt care.¬† They all know I have a screw loose already and I use these walking methods when I need to pace on a phone call, can‚Äôt go outside, or have only a few mins but I do indeed have some time to squeeze in some steps.

So like I said, some in-house walking is heavily suggested and a great step booster, so unless you‚Äôre unwilling to be the butt of a few jokes from the folks who love ya most ‚Ä¶ get a walking pad.

\*BONUS TIPS!\*

Footwear is important!¬† Comfortable sneakers are a must, but **comfortable socks** are even more important!  Get thicker ""comfort socks"" or ""padded socks.""  They go a long way to keeping your feet healthy and make even your most comfortable shoes even more comfortable.

¬†Sticking on the theme of footwear.¬† **Waterproof shoes or sneakers** for when it rains, has rained, or even walking on grass when there is morning dew.

¬†**Theragun or any other kind of massage gun.**  These are AMAZING for the bottom of your feet and calves as you really start upping the activity.

Good set of **comfortable headphones**.  If you're going to be on calls, or watching Netflix, or scrolling social media ... comfortable headphones are a must.

**Lightweight hoodies** for sun and bug protection.  I personally don't want to be lathering up sunscreen reguarly and hate when bugs fly in, on, or around my ears/neck.

**Backpack** to carry some stuff like water bottle, keys, etc. or to add weight to your walk.¬† If you are going to add some weight to your backpack, which I strongly recommend doing once you get way better at this, add some blankets, towels, or anything else relevant you have around your house or garage to the bottom of the backpack so that the weight sits higher in the pack.¬† You don‚Äôt want it way down at the bottom of the backpack pulling you down and pulling the backpack straps hard against your shoulders.¬† You want the weight sitting nice and high in the upper half of your back resting on whatever you packed at the bottom of the pack as it will pull less, be more comfortable, and support better shoulder posture.

¬†For me personally, I have also found that about 15-20% of my body weight is best as the amount of weight in the backpack.¬† If you‚Äôre 100 lbs, that would be 15-20 pounds max in the backpack.¬† If you‚Äôre 200 lbs, that would be 20-30 lbs in the backpack.¬† This percent through my trial and error is the one that allows you to feel and benefit from the added resistance, but it doesn‚Äôt impact your gate or ability to walk at the same pace.¬† I can still do 120 steps per minute when I‚Äôm carrying 15-20% of my body weight in the pack.¬† Once you start getting to higher percentages, you can obviously still do it, but I do believe you‚Äôre starting to now create a tradeoff between the resistance you‚Äôre carrying and the speed/pace you are walking.¬† So you‚Äôll carry more wight, but you‚Äôll get in less steps for the same amount of time.

**Incorporate pushups into your walk.**¬† Every 500 steps, or every 1,000 steps, drop down and do a set of pushups.¬† If you do a 60-minute walk, that is 7,000+ steps.¬† Even if you‚Äôre only doing 15 pushups each 1,000 steps, that is now 7,000 steps + 105 pushups.¬† Do this every day for a month and just watch how much your physique, fitness, health and wellness improve.",1,1727898894.0,walking,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôll save the whole ‚Äúbig my whole life‚Äù spill, I have. I ate like SHIT growing up and my mom kind of just fed us what she could ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

As I got older I really didn‚Äôt pay attention to what I was eating(fast food, energy drinks, etc and I smoked at this time too) . Got pregnant, had a baby, got pregnant >6 months later, still didn‚Äôt pay much attention until the very end of the pregnancy. I tried cutting out sodium somewhat but still ate a LOT of bread, and even with my home cooked food I didn‚Äôt pay attention to labels. 

After I had my last daughter, my blood pressure was like 168/102 and I flipped out crying in the waiting room, they put my on BP meds, I‚Äôve been a train wreck since ü•¥ 

That was in 2022, here I am in 2024 still fat and I‚Äôm just hopeless at times. Still on meds (My PCP said he. Was confident if I lost the weight my BP would come down too and this is 100% my goal because I have INSANNEEEE health anxiety) 

So, I‚Äôm a picky eater, but I work from home and I‚Äôm at a PC desk from 9AM-8PM. I try to walk or stay active on my breaks (15,30 min lunch, 15) and after work. Though it is HARD. Normally I cook and get my baby ready for bed after work and shows or clean and by the time I‚Äôm done it‚Äôs 12,1AM and I need to sleep to be up for work at 8:45. 
 
I‚Äôll eat Chicken, Beef, Steak, some Tuna, turkey bacon, turkey sausage (tho the Turkey sausage is a little high in sodium so I don‚Äôt eat it much). 

I eat corn, potatoes, peas, green beans, kidney beans and some carrots but not too big on carrot a lot. I use garlic SO much. 

Fruits I eat oranges, apples, strawberries, grapes, bananas. 

I can eat a lot but try not to, but my weakness is fast food when I‚Äôm too tired to cook. I don‚Äôt have an issue stopping that though it‚Äôs not a big deal. I drink coffee every morning (my big weakness is ice coffee from McDonald‚Äôs but I‚Äôm trying to stop that in opt for home coffee with creamer) 

Anyways, this is my lifestyle, and I need ideas, tips, tricks, etc to help me lose weight  PLEASE. 

I do have high BP so I need to watch my sodium, my bad cholesterol was elevated/high last time so I need to stay away from stuff that raises it or at least need a plan on when I could eat it or how much to eat each week. Or foods that actually help lower it would be nice! I‚Äôm a bread addict so I try to get low carb bread so I‚Äôd like to keep that or find a way to make dinner ideas without so much bread. 

I use wheat pasta too. Some flavors of the cick pea pasta throws me off, I‚Äôve tried it. I use Leto choc chips, don‚Äôt add sugar to my baking dishes, etc. 


I have a treadmill and between times I try to get at least 2,000 steps a day, which I can do easy. But for the love of EVERYTHING, with the kid I have and work (10+ hours each day for shifts at a computer) and cleaning and cooking I can never get close to that ever. 

I really just want to lose the weight. I don‚Äôt smoke anymore but I do vape (lowering the amount I vape currently to completely quit eventually) and my health just scares me so bad. A lot of
My family has health problems and I really want to avoid as much as possible. Also, I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm rambling because this is just so much on me lol. 

Like I want to lower my sodium, Sat fat, carbs and sugar but how can I do that? It‚Äôs like picking and choosing one and I can never find something that has ALL of it low enough for me and my goals.

I wanted to share a few **key financial habits** that have helped me gain more control over my spending and income. For many people, the hardest part of organizing personal finances isn‚Äôt just knowing what to do with their money, but **maintaining healthy habits** in the long run.

Here are a few habits that have worked well for me:

1. **Track Everything**: There‚Äôs no better way to know where your money is going than by keeping a record. Did you know that 60% of people don‚Äôt track small purchases like coffee or snacks? With ""My Accounts and Expenses,"" you can **automate your daily income and expense tracking** so you never miss a detail.
2. **Categorize Your Expenses**: Many of us don‚Äôt realize how much we‚Äôre spending in specific areas (food, entertainment, etc.). The app allows you to **create custom categories** for each type of expense, helping you **visualize exactly** where your money is going.
3. **Set Budgets**: Want to stop overspending on non-essentials? You can set budgets for each category, and the app will notify you when you‚Äôre getting close to your limit. It‚Äôs a great way to keep yourself accountable!
4. **Review Your Spending Patterns Monthly**: Instead of waiting until the end of the month to be surprised by your balance, try doing weekly or monthly check-ins. ""My Accounts and Expenses"" offers **detailed reports** that show your spending habits so you can make smarter financial decisions.
5. **Forecast Your Account Balance**: One of the most useful features in ""My Accounts and Expenses"" is the ability to **forecast your account balance** based on upcoming expenses. By setting reminders for recurring bills or category-specific payments (like groceries or utilities), the app can predict what your balance will look like in the future. This makes it much easier to plan ahead and avoid any nasty surprises!

How do you manage your finances? Do you have any tips or habits that have worked well for you? I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences! And if you haven‚Äôt yet, I highly recommend trying out the ""My Accounts and Expenses"" app. It‚Äôs a great tool to help you stay on top of your finances without the hassle!

But things have been beginning to change for me, and im feeling quite uncertain on what i want to do. I'm coming to the end of a two year college course which will lead to a personal decision to go into university or elsewhere.

Since I'm in the design/art industry I can already see where this is going. I'm going to work my ass off for another three years and land an awesome job at mcdonalds. But there's a possibility that I will be able to go into an apprenticeship with my degree. Yes, an apprenticeship. I can get behind the fact that everyone starts somewhere, and I like the idea of taking on an apprenticeship in order to start working more within the industry by slowly building myself up. But this isn't exactly promised. I've become quite interested in Univeristy and how it could help me find multiple career opportunities. I feel as if im being slightly pressured by my peers to go to University. But I feel as if the whole idea of Univeristy is a bit of a con.

I'm wondering what other people's experiences are and if they're in a similar position/ or current situation and what their thoughts are. I have quite a sturdy portfolio and a strong bit of will left in me. But I'm still feeling conflicted and feeling as if I'd be much happier working in a random coffee shop down the road. 

P.S, this is mainly based upon the thought of leaving the mental torture of an academic based art degree, and possibly acknowledging the fact that I could land the same job I could get without any shitty diploma.",2,1727898216.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

We met through a dating app. During our second date, he asked me if i wanna be his bf. Me being excited since i never got into any relationship i said yes (will be my biggest regret) even though he's not fully my type. He told me in the second date that he has a wife still i said yes without thinking abt any consequence that it might cause.

The first few weeks were nice actually bcs i've never felt special in my life. He treated me quite well, like any other loving bf. But after the 2 months when the sparks had started to fade, I started acting differently. I stopped being excited before meeting him. I started to notice the incompatibilities between us, which mainly came the age and background thing; we think v differently (maybe bcs im from academia and hes not). 

So, I started looking for others (i know i'm a horrible human being). And i found another guy lets say tyler(fake name) 23M, which is my current bf. We share so many similarities and i love him so much. We started texting while i was still with my ex. He knows the story with my ex but not this specific detail.

Okay so back to jake. One day (2 months in) he found out abt me cheating and he asked me to choose one, him or my cur. I didnt choose anyone bcs the thing with tyler wasnt very promising at that time, basically i dont want to lose anyone. So me and jake broke up that day. It was my first break up and it hurts. I cried the whole night. The next day jake texted me asking me to come back with him. I said yes (another mistake). All of this happenned while i was still texting with tyler. Jake knew this but cant do anything since i said we're just gaming buddies

After a week or so, me and tyler become closer and closer and we decided to go gym together regularly. While i was constantly making excuses to not go gym with jake. I barely met jake, once or twice a week. He kept asking if i still text tyler where i lied.

3 months in, jake's wife found out abt me and they got divorced. A few days later me and tyler got together. I wanted to dump jake but the tiny tiny leftover kindness in me telling me to wait for a while before leaving him. A few weeks passed by, me and tyler become more and more closer. I started to worry abt the jake situation ruining my current relationship. So i dumped jake, few weeks after he got divorced.

1 months passed by (5 months since first i got together with jake), every day he's begging me to go back to him. And every day i replied with no by saying ""i was just curious"", ""i didnt actually love him"", etc. Sometimes when i got very annoyed by his constant texting i replied with harsh word like talking abt his body like that. (Before u guys said just block him, i tried and he kept making another account to contact me, so its useless). He even threatened to tell my family that im gay if i didnt meet him (im still closeted and live in a conservative family). So i met him telling him i wanna focus with my phd and not wanna be in a relationship anymore. And he stopped texting me

For a while.

1 moths later he came to my house asking me if i wanna grab some coffee. I said no for forever. He threatened me again by outing me to my family. So we made an agreement with several points, but the main point is i reply to his text and meet once a week, he will never say anything to my fam, and we will never get back together (i know this agreement favored me but he's desperate at thi point, i will tell u guys later). This was the point where i told tyler abt all the situation with jake. He was okay with it and he's happy that i was being open with him.

Okay so we're going back to before i broke up with tyler for the 1st time, when things started to become stale. Basically when jake's wife found out abt me she wanted to meet me and report me to the police or meeting my family. Jake defended me and chose to divorce his wife to be full-time with me, in which he said the sacrifice. All this without telling me anything.

So recently jake told me this and we got into heated argument. My argument was why not speak abt this and discuss. I said ""i never asked for any sacrifice and u know i cheated yet u still stupidly leftyour family"". In his defence he said "" i didnt want her to out me to my family"". 

Now his mental health went down to the point of he almost going crazy (from the trauma). He's alone now with all his family and friends left him (bcs his wife out him). I felt bad so i started to check him daily. Every day whenever i visit him he ask me to go back with him but i always reply with no. He doesnt know im with tyler and i will never tell him bcs that would hurt him. I care abt him now bcs i feel guilty. I dont want him to hurt himself. Thats why i check on him daily but he always cry everyyime he sees me so i dont know what to do.

I feel like anything i do just harm him. What do you guys think should i do? Any input would be appreciated since i cant talk abt this with my friends since im closeted.


Sorry for my bad english since its not my first language.

Thanks

It was only 2021 when Dreame launched its first floor cleaner, the H11, and since then, as with robot vacuum cleaners, it has never stopped evolving its cleaning tools, although the H14 is already available on the market and the H14 Pro presentation will not be long away, I had the opportunity to try what I currently believe is the best quality/price choice on the market and I will try to let you know about it in the following lines.

For those who still don‚Äôt know what a floor cleaner is, it is a device designed to combine the vacuuming and washing of floors in a single tool, not only halving cleaning times but allowing, unlike the traditional mop, to always wash with clean water and detergent, thanks to the self-cleaning roller it can vacuum both solids and liquids leaving only a thin layer of water on the floor which dries very quickly, and in the case of the H13 Pro it can also reduce maintenance to a minimum and add some very interesting features.

UNBOXING, EQUIPMENT AND QUALITY

[https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAYiMeIoBzD/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAYiMeIoBzD/)

Once the package has been opened we will find ourselves in front of the main body of cylindrical shape which maintains the family feeling started with H11, the only operation to do will be to insert the handle into the appropriate slot and remove the protections, continuing the unboxing we find the base of charging, washing and drying, a roller and a spare HEPA filter, a cleaning brush, a bottle of multi-surface cleaner and the inevitable use and maintenance manual (which I always recommend to read carefully). The charging base, now streamlined and reduced in size, unfortunately loses the possibility of storing spare parts, only the space for the brush remains. The H13 Pro stands out for the high quality of its materials and assembly, a quality that can be perceived both by touching it and listening to it during its use, I didn‚Äôt expect anything less from Dreame.

TECHNICAL FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS

Although the operation remains the same as the previous versions, there is now a 300W, 100.000 rpm, 18.000PA suction motor inside, assisted by the roller capable of rotating up to 520 rpm, this translates into surprising performance.

The continuous flow of fresh water and detergent from the 900ml tank ensures that you always wash with a clean roller, everything is then conveyed by the powerful suction motor into the 700ml dirt tank which integrates a separator for solid dirt, as an interesting engineering note on contacts that detect when the tank is full, there are two rubber protections to avoid the problem common to many floor cleaners that get dirty and incorrectly indicate the tank is full when it is actually not.

When holding the floor cleaner you immediately notice the three function buttons, from the bottom the on/off button, the mode selection button and the self-cleaning button, from here your gaze immediately falls on the large circular display which indicates the 4 cleaning modes:

https://preview.redd.it/lhiksfbfaesd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb7d8d0d5970114c5da03f4bdc1bb4508054eea9

AUTO which automatically adjusts suction, brush rotation and quantity of water based on the dirt detected and signals it in real time on the screen with a crown which gradually turns green, yellow and red and immediately makes you understand the extent of the dirt with the which one you are dealing with.

TURBO that pushes capabilities to the maximum for the most complicated situations

ULTRA which adds water treatment to the turbo mode to create a sterilizing and sanitizing solution and which, unlike the classic electrolysis function present in other products, also allows it to be used together with the detergent.

LIQUID SUCTION which, as the name suggests, allows you to vacuum any liquid that has been spilled on the ground, water, milk, juice, etc. In this mode, no water is introduced but only liquid on the floor is sucked up. As always, I would like to point out that this mode in the H13 Pro, as in other floor cleaners, should absolutely not be used dry like a common vacuum cleaner.

Looking down at the brush we find the two most fascinating innovations. The brush cover integrates a transparent section with a powerful LED strip which helps to clearly see dirt in poorly lit areas.

By removing the brush cover we can observe the soft microfibre roller that runs along the entire length of the floor cleaner, managing to clean practically up to the edges of the skirting boards and furniture on both sides.

The time has come to fill the water tank, add the detergent and start cleaning, a feature that is immediately noticeable, in addition to the low noise level which makes its use not at all annoying to the ears, the wheels integrate the ‚ÄúGlideWheel Power‚Äù technology. System‚Äù, the wheels are moved back and forth by two motors positioned in the wheels, which precisely follow the user‚Äôs movements and eliminate the effort needed to make it move, the system has been significantly improved compared to H12 Pro and truly H13 Pro it can be moved with one finger.

Once the cleaning session is over, it‚Äôs time to put it back on the base for self-cleaning, drying and charging and this is where, in my opinion, the H13 Pro amazes the most.

First of all, self-cleaning can be selected on two levels, standard and intensive, to start the intensive one just press the self-cleaning button a second time, but the most interesting feature is undoubtedly the washing with hot water at 60¬∞ and with double rotation , the roller is in fact rotated dynamically clockwise and anti-clockwise at different speeds to maximize cleaning and when the wash is finished, ‚Äúwring‚Äù the roller well, it is the first floor cleaner that succeeds in giving an almost perfect roller wash and in a month of I have never had the need to manually wash the roller.

Drying follows automatically (which can be activated and deactivated manually by holding down the self-cleaning button for a long time) which also takes place at 60¬∞ by rotating the roller alternately slowly and like a centrifuge and returns almost always perfect drying in 30 minutes , I say almost because being a fixed setting it does not take into account external temperatures and there is no humidity sensor that regulates drying accordingly. However, the system works very well and I have never smelled bad odors coming from the floor cleaner.

The performance is remarkable, no matter if you are dealing with daily dirt, coffee stains, jam, hair tangles, milk, animal food, crumbs, mud or if you want to spill a plate of spaghetti as seen in usual presentations, H13 Pro, especially in turbo and ultra modes, is an unstoppable bulldozer, very few things are capable of putting it in difficulty and in truly disastrous situations it will be enough to make more passes, moving it around the house is really simple and its 5.6kg is almost not noticeable.

The declared autonomy of the 6X4900mAh cells is 40 minutes, a value that is reached in rather clean environments, in the most energy-intensive modes or with the automatic mode indicator constantly on red, the hand stops at around 20 minutes, then the quick recharge fills the batteries completely in 4 hours. Too bad the charging doesn‚Äôt work together with the self-cleaning, so if you put the floor cleaner on the base with a battery below 15% you will have to wait a while to start the self-cleaning, and please always check that there is enough water left in the tank.

Maintenance is truly reduced to a minimum, just empty and wash the dirt container and refill the water and detergent, self-cleaning is so efficient that you won‚Äôt have to carry out maintenance and cleaning of the roller for weeks or even months.

THE GOOD

* Brush that washes from edge to edge and useful LED light
* Solid waste separator and contacts protection
* The traction wheels make it maneuverable and light
* Few like it can handle animal hair so well
* The self-cleaning and hot drying functions are amazing but‚Ä¶

THE BAD

* A humidity sensor would have been useful to regulate drying
* The charging base does not have enough space for the included accessories and spare parts
* Self-cleaning does not start with battery power lower than 15%.
* It is still a device without a replaceable battery

CONCLUSIONS

It‚Äôs difficult to draw conclusions with the H14 already on sale and the H14 Pro just around the corner, I‚Äôll just point out what makes it better than the H12 Pro‚Ä¶ everything. More powerful and manoeuvrable, even in extreme situations it provides impeccable cleaning, intelligent and safe to use lightly even on the most delicate floors and absolutely recommended for those who have animals. The positive side of already having a subsequent product and one soon to be presented is which is already at an excellent price and the purchase is even more justified if on promotion, and we should wait for the H14 Pro to see innovations that will convince us to postpone the purchase.

I save for last the personal considerations which are more inherent to the characteristics that I look for in the perfect floor cleaner, the H13 Pro does not tilt to 180¬∞ and is difficult if not impossible to wash under furniture, the battery is not yet replaceable like on vacuum cleaners and this castrates a little continuity of cleaning in large environments, it is not a combo model so it does not replace a vacuum cleaner if you just want to vacuum.

Having rattled off these last considerations which are more of a ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù than real defects, I can only recommend the H13 Pro to anyone looking for a top of the range floor cleaner at a more than affordable price, complete with all the functions and with self-cleaning among the best seen until today, if you have animals then perhaps it is among the few that I would recommend with my eyes closed.

1fuoxo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fuoxo0/where_did_the_cocodamol_go/,Where Did The Co-codamol Go?,"Hi. Please would you help me to understand what happened last week with my 15yo child?

TW: Self harm, suicide 

Last week, my 15yo attempted suicide alone at 2am. They pre-punched-out all the tablets and swallowed the handfuls with a small amount if water, at once. We had eaten protien-heavy homemade pizzas at 6pm that evening, with a big glass of water, no liquid in-between. The tablets were as follows;

26 √ó paracetamol (acetaminophen for USA) 500mg
42 √ó ibuprofen 400mg
20 √ó cocodamol 30/500mg

They woke me at 2:30am to tell me and I phoned for an ambulance immediately. Unfortunately, the call handler did not tell me that there was going to be a delay in dispatching a unit out to us. If we'd known that, then we would have thrown the child in the car and driven them to out nearest hospital, which is 20 minutes away. We waited, in part, because if anything happened during the drive, we wouldn't be able to help. Far better to wait for transport that can deliver care while en route. 

An ambulance arrived just after 4:45am. 
The wait was terrifying, obviously, and I called twice more during that almost 2¬Ωhr wait to see if there were any useful instructions under what must be dire circumstances for the hospitals, given the delay. ""The child is begging for a drink of water, can we let them?"", ""They're getting harder and harder to keep awake"". ""Should we just drive in?"" We were told to hang tight and that help is coming. I didn't know whether it would be better to keep them up and walking to keep them awake, or laying still to avoid speeding up their digestion. The emergency call handlers seemed not to understand my question and repeating that I shouldn't give them anything to eat or drink or make them sick. It was frustrating and worrying, as I'm sure you can imagine. 

When we arrived just after 5am, the children's hospital was almost empty so we had all the attention they could need. Once we got to the hospital, the care seemed exemplary and we're beyond grateful. 

My first concern in all this was the codeine content. That seemed like a lot. The child is 5'7"" and around 11stone (around 155lb). They very much have their adult body already and are built for strength, not speed. 

Tablets were reported as going in at 2am. It wasn't until approximately 3am that they started acting 'lose' or overly relaxed? Before then, they were just worried that they'd caused a kerfuffle, sorry and embarrassed. By 4am, I would have described their presentation as ""looking a bit stoned"". They only started to get difficult to wake up and slurring/not making as much sense in the last 20 minutes before the ambulance arrived. At that point I was basically watching their breathing because my understanding of codeine is that it can slow the breathing to a stop. I figured that the paracetamol takes longer to process and we'll definitely be in hospital by the time that was a problem.  If I'm honest, I sort of assumed that much ibuprofen would strip their entire digestive system for a month and wasn't the biggest problem, but might cause the most discomfort.  

We got to the hospital and bloods were drawn, paperwork filled out, and when the first fast-test came back, they were put on the first bag of NAC just before 5:30am. They were pretty sleepy by then so by 6am, I'm outside, calling my husband and trying to find coffee. By that point, I would say they were sleepy and were sick every time they were asked to sit up to do anything (no pills, just liquid in ever reducing pinkness from the ibuprofen coating), but they never lost consciousness and breathing was never an issue.  

There seemed to be a problem with their veins, in that it was VERY difficult to get a blood draw or canular in, the first bag of NAC took almost 25% longer to go in than they'd planned. I didn't know whether that would have been caused by dehydration or the codeine but it was very much a feature of their treatment. Do people just have VERY SLOW circulation?

I now can't remember what time that bag was finished but they took more bloods, they reacted to the fast-test but needed the full test as well to see how it's going, is what I was told. Then they put on the 8hr NAC bag. My child was still very sleepy, but not unwakably so - it looked like a paracetamol overdose, to me (don't ask why I know). 

By 2pm, they were awake enough for a CAMHS conversation, in which they talked more openly than I'm used to them doing, and with real clarity about this attempt, why, what's been going on, what led to the timing of it, etc. This is a child who, not unlike a lot of ASD 15yos, tends to communicate in monosyllables and shrugging so it was great! They admitted to still feeling 'spaced out' but otherwise actually quite well. They didn't fancy food but tried a sandwich and found eating made them feel much better! 

The 8hr bag took something like 12hrs to go in because the uptake was INCREDIBLY slow. The canular was checked in case it was blocked, and it was reported as being perfectly comfortable - not stinging or feeling ""off"" in any way. It was just a circulation thing, apparently. No one was worried, just frustrated that the NAC protocol wasn't going to plan. Over night the bag finished and more blood was drawn for testing. 

By 7am, they were deemed dischargeable, with advice to watch out for bloody vomit or stools and to come straight back if that was the case. The ward was never more than half full, so it didn't feel like a rush job, just that they were OK. They still reported feeling 'spaced out', oddly, a little euphoric/serene, but I put that down to the surrealism of the situation, and quite tired/sleepy. 

After 26hrs in hospital, they were done, discharged and the whole event now gets put down to a mental health situation, no longer a physical health one. 

That 'very calm, serene' state lasted all the way until they went back to school, 8 days later. Now we're back into the more familiar ""hanging on by my nails"" state which is what _caused_ all this, to start with. They felt that it was the experience of the noise, bustle and overstimulation of school that 'snapped me out of that state'.

I'm so confused.  As per my title; I can't understand where cocodamol went! Everything I saw, just looked like a paracetamol/acetaminophen overdose.  Those cocodamol are mine. I've had to warn people against driving on 30/500mg cocodamol if they're not used to it because it can impair judgement.  I take them in pairs. I HAVE taken them, forgotten I've taken them, and then taken them again. This has resulted in feeling really quite impaired and almost feeling like I have to remember to breathe, if that doesn't sound daft. I cannot equate what I saw in someone who had never taken any codeine before, with what I saw in my child, who had had 20 at once. 

I managed to speak to a nurse before we left, to initiate a conversation about levels of medication and she seemed nonchalant - ""that's what the NAC protocol is _for_ it does it really well, that this is, sadly, not extraordinary"".  When we were admitted, I gave them all the empty packets and shared the quantities that my child had reported taking. Speaking to the consultant after the first blood tests, they never said there was any discrepancy between the reported doses and what was showing up in the blood tests. When I spoke to the nurse ad we were being discharged,  I raised the question of the quantities, specifically, in order to make space for her to say if the hospital didn't think my child had taken as much as they had said, but it was never raised. I do believe that if they'd turned up with 12 paracetamol inside them, that the doctor would have said something and that it would have been raised as a separate issue with the mental health team: The mental health implications of a child that has lied about taking an overdose are just different to those of a child who very much HAS tried to delete themselves.  No mention has been made that the numbers didn't add up and we're very much on the self-deletion pathway in terms of follow-up appointments.  As such I do not doubt that they took what they claimed to have taken. 

If that is the case, can anyone help me to understand where the codeine went? They seemed not really to have been effected AT ALL by it. I wonder if this is worth noting as medically important in case of future treatment  - CAN people be immune to opioids? Is that a thing? 

For clarity, I guess I'm asking 'why wasn't it worse?' and 'does this all sound typical to you?'",2,1727897707.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

# Free-to-Play and Locations

Unlike games like StepN, Truworld is completely free-to-play; you don‚Äôt need to purchase an NFT or hold tokens to participate. While Pok√©mon Go makes everyone walk and catch cool characters, it often leads players to restaurants, markets, coffee shops, gyms, or fast food spots, sometimes without them realizing the app is actually funneling them to locations.

# Innovating Location-Based Airdrops and Real-World Exploration

In Truworld, everyone can set up onchain airdrops at specific locations, offering tokens or NFT digital collectibles to explorers. Our goal is to ensure explorers receive tangible rewards too.

Truworld transforms the real world into a giant playground full of onchain rewards and drives users to physical locations for advertising, creating innovative IRL interactions through gamification and social features.

Explorers visiting these locations in Truworld can collect these airdrops, driving real-world traffic and engagement. Truworld encourages real-world exploration rather than purely digital engagement.

We realized that the Play-to-Airdrop strategy is flawed ‚Äî it often attracts users who are only interested in earning a quick buck, not in staying and exploring. That‚Äôs why, at Truworld, our aim is to gather everyone, whether they‚Äôre hunting for airdrops or exploring the fog of the world.

The best part? Truworld explorers experience the real world while earning airdrops and other rewards.

# Earn by Contributing

In Truworld, everyone‚Äôs contributions are valued and rewarded. Whether you create, post, comment, review, or refer others, your active participation enhances the platform‚Äôs value, and we make sure you‚Äôre recognized for it.

There are plenty of ways to earn rewards in Truworld. To measure an explorer‚Äôs progress and achievements, we‚Äôve introduced a metric known as ‚ÄúFootprint.‚Äù This composite measure tracks an explorer‚Äôs base footprint, boost rewards, and bonus rewards.

To add a thrilling layer to daily exploration, Truworld has introduced treasure chests. Each day, you have the opportunity to unlock three randomly generated chests ‚Äî Bronze, Silver, and Gold ‚Äî located in various places. As you move to these locations, you‚Äôll discover rewards hidden inside, ranging from valuable EXP points to other surprises. The closer ones are easier to find, but the real prize lies in the distant Gold Chest.

# Easy Onboarding for Explorers

Getting started with Truworld is simple. First, it‚Äôs free to play, and no wallet is required. You can log in with just your Google or other social media accounts. Truworld is designed to be Web2-friendly, so even if you‚Äôre new to crypto, you can jump right in without any complications.

Truworld‚Äôs mission is to give back as much as possible. Whether through tokens, NFTs, major collaborations, or hefty airdrops, we‚Äôre committed to delivering substantial rewards to our explorers.

Tokens, NFTs, major collaborations, and hefty airdrops are next. Truworld promises an exciting journey ahead, with opportunities to earn and grow. To explore or help us explore, join our Telegram and Discord communities.

1fuop33,https://i.redd.it/1o7kblq89esd1.jpeg,A yellow box junction rant/moan/acceptance of fate,"Was driving home from work in Kingston upon Thames on Saturday, and got caught in the most almighty traffic, and made what felt like the only decision I could, and ended up in a yellow box junction. See picture:

I‚Äôm in the red lane, buses are turning from the blue lane and inevitably turning left following the purple arrow. Problem is, the road with the purple arrow has somehow got some kind of issue, because buses are unable to turn left there for ages. The only time the road ahead of me was clear was when my light was red and traffic from the right was coming through. I sat there for about ten minutes (not an exaggeration), and not once was the road ahead of me clear when my light was green. Both lanes next to me were extremely congested by the traffic ahead and in similar positions to me, so eventually I made the choice to move forward and sit behind a bus in the yellow box, and then was able to move around it and get into the middle lane. I don‚Äôt believe there was any traffic that came from the right of the junction before I moved over and out of the box, but I assume that won‚Äôt make a difference.

Honestly didn‚Äôt think the box was monitored, but apparently I don‚Äôt know what a yellow box camera looks like, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it was now. Not sure exactly how much I was in the box (I wasn‚Äôt blocking traffic any more than the bus in front of me was), or can‚Äôt quite remember how long I was there for, but I sit now and await my fine (money‚Äôs already tight as it is).

Annoyed because I‚Äôm normally extremely careful about this kind of thing, and annoyed because I feel a bit like my hand was forced. Annoyed at myself because I should have found a way to get over to the right before moving forward, and annoyed that at the end of the day it was my own stupid fault. Praying for some kind of divine intervention where the council see how mad traffic was that day and decide not to fine (I know, I know.)

I regret my choice every day. I miss my freedom so much. My last dog was such an easy dog and would just chill and cuddle all day. I could leave 4-5 hours and know she was ok in the crate.

I know how the title sounds but let me just explain. My fiancee and I have a 7 week old baby, we let family hold her and see her as much as we could despite being uncomfortable doing so because I mentally could not handle the drama that would have ensued with certain family members right after birth.

  Last week our daughter developed strange symptoms so we‚Äôve been taking her to her doctor the emergency room and trying to get appointments with specialists. One thinks she‚Äôs having seizures one thinks she has a rare condition one thinks she‚Äôs fine! We‚Äôre new parents and scared crapless! 

 When we first believed she was having seizures I went to talk to some of my fiancee family members as we all live on the same property. One family member mentioned seeing strange eye movement in our baby a couple of days before she showed symptoms with me . ( which is insane because I‚Äôm with her 24/7 minus a hour a week when I get coffee with my mom) when I asked why she didn‚Äôt say anything she said she thought it was normal. I‚Äôm not mad I understand baby‚Äôs do weird things! 

Fast forward to getting a kind of diagnosis but not really because we still have a bunch of tests she needs done, my fiancee mentions he would like for us to be the only two to hold her until we get the results back for seizures, her heart and sees a eye doctor. He‚Äôs worried people would see symptoms and not say anything or she could launch herself (which she does she has very strong spasms throughout the day) and they could drop her. 

I want to trust our family‚Äôs to be honest but I do agree that it is a risk. I already told my side of the family who are sad but 100% understanding. I‚Äôm worried about his side of the family as we live with them and I really don‚Äôt want them to think we don‚Äôt trust them. It‚Äôs more of an extra safety measure. We also need to see anything out of the ordinary to report to her doctor.

","So, I recently started dating this HCA/Nurse who seemed amazing at first. We hit it off quickly, partly because we both work in healthcare, and it felt like we had a lot in common. She was cute, caring, and passionate about her work. One thing I found out early on, though, was that she was living in homeless accommodation despite working full-time & driving a 30k suv. I didn‚Äôt judge, but I was curious why. She explained she had an abusive ex who was now in prison for drugs and weapons charges.

I thought, ""Okay, that‚Äôs rough, but it‚Äôs her past, and everyone has one, right?"" Things escalated quickly. Just a few weeks into dating, she dropped the L-word while we were out for a walk. She was very affectionate, then she became really insistent that we meet each other‚Äôs parents. I was surprised but agreed to go with it. One day, without warning, she brought me to meet her family. They seemed okay, but as time went on, it became clear her family had their own issues despite how they presented themselves, & when she met my mother she wasn't showing much interest at all, I had to feed the conversation.

As our relationship progressed, I started noticing cracks. Driving to scenic places she'd spend her entire time on the phone even when walking the dog, I felt so confused, why am I here If she's just going to be on her phone texting?, then whenever she had a falling out with her mother or was going through other struggles, I‚Äôd try to be supportive and offer advice. But instead of appreciating my care, she would get annoyed or irritated with me. I was just trying to help, but it felt like everything I said rubbed her the wrong way.

Then, the real red flags started popping up. She casually mentioned how she once helped a colleague during an inappropriate act at work, even kissed him as he did it, I brushed it off as something in her past, but the fact that she just threw it out there felt weird.

Things went downhill fast. Her texts became less frequent, and the effort on her end just faded. We began arguing over the smallest things, and no matter how much I tried to be there for her, it was never enough. The final blow came when she reluctantly admitted she had been in a friends-with-benefits situation with a doctor at her workplace for a year and a half, someone twice her age. This came out because she got jealous when the doctor showed interest in one of her friends they had met & he then slept with her.

Here‚Äôs the kicker on the same day that I was pouring my heart out to her over the phone, begging to fix things, she was out getting coffee with this doctor and her friend. I didn‚Äôt know at the time, and I felt like a complete fool when I found out.

Now she‚Äôs gone from my life, and for the first time, I‚Äôm dealing with anxiety. I‚Äôm healing, slowly, but the whole thing has messed with me more than I could have imagined. I just needed to get this off my chest.

A few months ago, I recovered a bit, and started to feel lonely. So I put ""I am now ready to start a new relationship"" things in my dating apps profile, ""looking for a long term relationship"", I don't even know what a short term relationship is. I am not sure if I am ready, it's really difficult to think of the past, every time I try my ears start ringing and my brain freezes, but my therapist told me it's important for me to know that I was capable of meeting a new person and making a new relationship at this stage. Why not dipping a toe?

After meeting a few women, mostly divorced and having kids, now I don't even know what I can get from diving into the dating stuff.

I have two kids, I am the only responsible adult who can be the caregiver. I have a full time job and need this job. I am busy with my job and kids, and I don't want my personal life and my kids' life overlap. Maybe what I wanted was having a coffee chat a couple times a week whining about a tough day.

I thought it's the same for divorced women. They must be busy with their life already. But it looks like not being ready for the commitment far more than I expected, like marriage or living together, doesn't allow me be in the starting line? For me it's difficult to understand what they want. Maybe they just refused me politely for other reasons and I didn't catch it.

1fuoifw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fuoifw/what_are_your_opinions/,what are your opinions??,"I (M-17) started talking to this girl (F-16) about three years ago during a friend‚Äôs birthday. As a prank, I was supposed to set her up with that friend, but he wasn‚Äôt serious about it. Even though I played the wingman, she wasn‚Äôt interested in him. Eventually, I admitted it was all a joke, and she said she already knew, so it was harmless. That‚Äôs how we started talking, and over the next two years, we grew closer as friends.

But, I developed feelings. I‚Äôve always been insecure when it comes to dating and relationships. We would talk every day for hours, both during the day and late into the night. I never confessed my feelings because I was fine with the one-sided love. I loved those days of teasing and pulling each other‚Äôs leg.

Then, another guy came into the picture‚Äîsomeone who seemed like a better version of me. I was working up the courage to confess my feelings, but before I could, she fell for him. She told me about it, and I pretended to be fine, even helping her navigate this new romance. But that guy ended up messing things up. He said something behind her back to his best friend, and she found out because she had access to his Instagram account. They had a huge argument, and she stopped talking to him. He then became a huge problem, getting desperate and bothering her friends, which made things worse for her. I did everything I could to help.

Over time, she started showing interest in me, but I was completely oblivious. I had convinced myself that she could never love me, so I buried my feelings and focused on other things. A few months later, during the summer holidays, we hung out one-on-one for the first time outside of school. We just went to a mall and had coffee. Afterward, she was supposed to meet up with her best friend, but since she was running late, she asked me to drop her off. When we got there, her friend insisted that I stay, even though I felt awkward.

While we were leaving, her friend whispered in my ear, ""She likes you."" I was shocked and didn‚Äôt believe it‚ÄîI thought it was a prank. Later that day, she confessed to me over text. I was caught completely off guard and denied it, even rejecting her. She then said it was all fake and that she only did it to show the other guy that she wasn‚Äôt desperate. Even though she said that, I knew it was real, and I felt terrible for rejecting her.

My family issues and personal problems had made me push away the girl I loved. After that, I thought the best thing for her would be to lose feelings for me, so I started being distant. We argued more, and I deactivated my Instagram account, which was our main way of communicating. That was the worst decision I ever made. I had rejected the girl I loved because I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to handle my situation. I thought pushing her away would be better for her, but instead, I made everything worse. I abandoned her when she needed me most.

Now, I‚Äôve learned that you only realize the true value of something when you lose it. But it‚Äôs too late‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt like me anymore. Nothing is the same, and it‚Äôs slowly eating away at me.",2,1727896635.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I asked her if she would like to go out and hang out or go for lunch, things like that.

We walked for a while, went for a coffee, and then went to hang out in a nearby park. I mustered up all the courage I had at the time and told her. As soon as I saw the look on his face I realized I had made a tremendous mistake. The next thing she did was look at her cell phone, pretended to read a message and said she had to go. I said goodbye, she got up and left.

She is in a different college than I am, but that was never an obstacle to not seeing each other often. Two days later I sent her a couple of messages asking how she was doing, typical, she never responded, from that night in the park, I never saw her again.

From then on, I decided that I would never try anything with someone with whom I already had a friendly relationship, because I already had an idea of the seriousness of the consequences.

I quit most of my social media because I am now studying (!!!) for a career change and most of these shiny little boxes were horrific time sucks. 

*However*, if I don't let off steam about work right now I may simply combust. 


My schedule with NF has changed as NK is now going to preschool, and I love my new hours - I am functionally a baby chauffeur and it gives me much more time for online classes and (bonus!) I can dress a little nicer because I am no longer walking miles per day through playgrounds, the zoo, etc. 

NK loves school, even if academically they have gone from a curated home curriculum where we were learning things like beginning reading and biology to the teacher sending photos with captions like ""exploring the dirt!""

Now, the first hour of my day is devoted to random NK tasks at NF house. Which means NF is leaving absolutely anything and everything vaguely NK related out for me to do. 

NK's full, barely picked at breakfast and all the dishes? Out for me to handle. All the adult dishes in the sink, dishwasher and drying rack? Out for me. When they do put dishes away over the weekend, they leave a pile of NK's dishes out on the counter for me to put away. 

When NK pees in the last plastic potty left in the house (in NK's bedroom) they leave it for me (which to me, is disgusting since it's like... humidifying NK's room with pee)

The playrooms (yes, rooms) are both always trashed, and I feel like I can't just leave them like that (not guilt, but genuinely that if they walk by and the playroom is trashed and I'm studying they will wonder why I'm leaving a mess.)

I got a text one day that NK had unrolled all the toilet paper and it was in the living room. And it was! Why was that my job????

Behaviorally, NK is a complete mess and throwing massive tantrums every other moment, compounded by the fact that NPs think they need to be ""tired out"" (read: completely physically exhausted so NPs don't have to do anything with them or hear crying at bedtime because still, at *three years old*, MB asks NK for permission to leave their room and if NK says no, just waits in there until NK falls asleep) at the end of the day so they signed them up for activities every day of the week that often require me to wake them up after 45 minutes of a nap. NK has responded to these new demands on their time by:

- hitting me in the face 
- refusing to toilet as a control mechanism 
- adopting nudism as a lifestyle 
- throwing plastic potty seats at my head
- running away from me in public and then, when I catch them, rotating in my arms like a possessed rotisserie chicken and screaming that I am a *mean nanny* and I'm hurting them
- developing a weird form of toddler OCD where they will do things like scream at me to put a particular toy in the bath, then decide that is Wrong and Bad and I need to Remove it Immediately and *dry it off* and hand it to them to put in the bath instead. Now, as someone who struggled with compulsive behaviors due to coping with trauma as a child (hello, flicking the light switch 20 times to ensure my parents wouldn't die in the night) I am really hesitant to enable this behavior, but if I don't NK screams and flings their head into the door repeatedly. 

DB is keeping the weird snarky little comments flowing:

- when telling him about NK's day and that they ate a muffin for snack: ""Loading them up with sugar, huh?"" SIR YOUR WIFE SETS THE MENUUUUU
- If he finds us inside the house at all when he thinks we should be running around to the point of exhaustion: ""Lazy day today, huh?""
- When NK is screaming sobbing because I had to give them a bath (which is *still* part of my job every day because it's ""too hard"" for DB to do) ""Oh, did Nanny give you a bath when you didn't want one?"" in the World's Most Sympathetic Voice, as if saying ""Oh, was Nanny kicking puppies in front of you again?"" Dude. Bro. Dad Boss. *You* require me to bathe them every day. This is *your rule*. 


And to cap it all off, for my recent multiple year anniversary, which they have never once acknowledged before, they gave me a *regifted* $20 coffee gift card that MB got from work and a note from NK apologizing for being a handful lately. 


Anyway. Can't wait to Be On The Computer professionally forever and never raise another person's child again, amen.

Am I going to contract listeria? ,"I made myself coffee today with some coconut milk (it was going to expire in 5 days according to the ‚Äúbest by‚Äù label, so I thought it was A-OK) and just when I was about to finish it, I felt this weird slimy chunk enter my mouth, and when I spit it out to observe it, it had this darkish discoloration in the center of it. 

I tried to go on google to find some answers, and to my horror, I got a bunch of articles about silk coconut milk getting recalled in Canada due to a LISTERIA OUTBREAK. 

Granted, I live in the USA, but I‚Äôm still worried because the supposed products that were affected apparently all had the ‚Äúbest by‚Äù dates between sept and oct (the one I drank was best by oct 7)

It‚Äôs been like 30 minutes since I drank it, and I feel fine, a little gassy, but no serious symptoms.

   * WeHo
      * [Uchi](https://uchi.uchirestaurants.com/location/west-hollywood/) - outstanding dinner (make a res)
      * [Craigs](https://craigs.la/) - Food is meh, go anyway just for the halibut branzino. Whatever you do, don't get the chicken, or maybe do? I'm still unsure.
   * East Hollywood
      * [Budonoki](https://www.budonoki.la/) - outstanding dinner, mugs are SO cute IRL (make a res) (mugs linked [here](https://saltyseadogdesigns.com/en-us/collections))

   * Dinner at **Craigs** (make a reservation)
      * Food and Drinks = Meh 
* **Observations and Musings**
   * Wondery+ and Trip Timing
      * I'm grateful for Wondery+ because I did not plan on prioritizing Budonoki until KH's fact check. They had mentioned it before, but the mugs had me reprioritize Budonoki over Sugarfish for this trip.
      * Since the mug company didn't post about Armcherries orders until this week, I imagine only a small percentage of Listeners went over to Wondery. I'm intrigued by this. So curious about how the business model works.
   * Los Feliz
      * Walking from Maru to Cara, I inadvertently passed the entrance to Dax's community - such a fun surprise!
      * Monica and Rob are champs for walking as much as they do. It is very easy to walk around Los Feliz but it‚Äôs not necessarily ‚Äúwalkable‚Äù as you might expect if you live in another urban city in the US where you like pass landmarks and monuments along the way. It feels much longer than a typical city walk.
      * I got a kick out of passing places I heard on the pod e.g. ‚ÄúVons‚Äù and ‚ÄúHouse of Pies‚Äù, but for most people, these would be insignificant. My friend I was visiting who went on this journey with me was very annoyed at my excitement lol
   * Leaf blowers
      * David was not hyperbolizing. I am born and raised in the USA and have never noticed more leaf blowing as I did during my 4 days in LA (but obvi this is baader meinhof).
      * Idk if it's because I've been living downtowns for the past 18 years but it felt incessant and WFH would be a nightmare for me (at least until I acclimated). In LA it seemed to be more about form over function... especially when it's still 100 degrees outside.
   * Lists and nyc burgers
      * One of these days (probably years from now =) when I can prioritize organizing my full list of pod recs per city, I will post it but if you want loosely organized pod recs for restaurants and hotels in NYC, LA, or Paris or London, lmk!
      * Nothing to do with this post but I saw someone post asking if the Emily Burger is any good. It is VERY GOOD but not as good as the [Jose Andres' burger](https://www.littlespain.com/news-item/burgers-get-the-basque-treatment-at-lena/) imo.

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

2 cups superfine almond flour

I love the idea of COH3 4v4 and would say it's the reason I brought the game and 10% of the 100 or so games I have played when a real contest took place it did not disappoint but for my own mental health I can not continue waiting 8 mins to play the first 10mins with the 1 in 10 chance of some sort of game! 

Q1. Today I reported someone called ""upyours"" who destroyed our base and refused to surrender. What will happen to there account? Why can we target the floor in our base? They coded that I can't target an ability in a base.

Q2. In the 1v1 I (using tips given here) used my flame thrower on buildings containing enemies troops which definitely increased the damage! Is there a penalty difference between a wooden building and a stone building?

Q3. The Army chart at the end showed they started with more troop power by quite a bit! The motor bike sidecart thing capped things at an very fast rate. I lost the first phase with zero stars is this normal in a German Vs Britain 1v1. I could in the future try and target just on VP plus fuel instead of spreading so much!.

Q3. Refit is awesome! It's completely changed my mid game! One of my light tanks was 2 star and refitted to take fuel from 60 to 90 which massively sped up getting the big tank with 2 guns. Was this smart.

Q4. In an older video on YouTube I was told I could over repair allies vehicles so in 2v2 I did this to help Allie. Does this work

Q5. In my head being able to summon the Australian Infantry would massively speed up my capping 1v1 which if they enter the field at a good spot it should but sometimes they enter far from the first cap! How do I know where they will enter and once I know will it always be the same! I know they can make defence can they repair and if yes to repair can they over repair or just eng.

Q6. On a recent 4v4 (the one with a town square in the middle) I at one point despite only making 1 mortar and summoning the one on a truck had 5 motars and they looked busy! When I looked at the stats at the end the total damage was next to nothing vehicles and six Infantry deaths! Are motars pointless an end of game and wasted man power collecting can you refit in some way? Can you refit anti tank guns?. I could not keep the truck safe that brought the larger mortar so sent back to base do you know it's refit value? On refit value do you get just fuel?

Q7. There are too few variables in 4v4, it's not just the maps but it's the army's and battle groups! Why do I have the choice of 3 battle groups! Maybe that's ok in 1v1 but if 4v4 with only  2 of each country they should each have a different battle group! In the 5v5 ranked games I used to play you need a tank, support, DPS, reaper, fast, slow. What if 4 players go same country same battle group it massively magnify any imbalance. The 5v5 games power creep new heros then after time (once every one has brought it) balance it out but because it part of a team so single imbalance and natural counters don't overwhelm. I wish they dropped the world war 2 theme (which I love)  for world at war and just kept adding countries like Poland, France, south Korea (massive micro transaction market) then it doesn't have to be allies Vs axis just the country you want to play and it's play style. 

Q8. Does this guy Sphinx who makes maps have a patron or a buy me a coffee thing because we need him to keep going!

We have been dating for a little more than a year and have known eachother for two years before that. 

He has a lot of homework and rarely has time to spend with me without distractions. He gets stressed and then cannot do anything other than the thing that he needs to do. Sometimes can't even think of anything else. 

I have Epilepsy that's usually brought on by stress. It's hard for me to keep up with my work and then I get stressed. I then sometimes have a seizure and then the next two weeks I have a hard time catching up on homework and I get overwhelmed and stressed again. I often want to just curl up with my boyfriend and watch a show or go on a walk or sit in a coffee shop with him but because of how he reacts to stress we can't really. 

We have loose plans for marriage and I really just want to be done with school and married to him. School stresses me and I know people always say this but I genuinely feel like I will be less stressed once I'm out of college and married to him. Part of me wants to just quit school because it's hard for me to deal with school and seizures. I have a summer long internship in another country and we plan to get married after that. 

How do you deal with someone who's (almost) too busy for you? I don't want to distract him too much because he wants to get good grades and graduate well but I also need time with him. Spending time with him takes away some of my stress and I just love being with him. It makes me sad when I cant spend one on one time with him or even time with him without homework. Our friend invited some of our friend group to watch a movie yesterday but my bf was too busy with homework to go and I didn't go... I wanted to go but our friend group is mostly men and one of their girlfriends who I'm not really close with. I also felt slightly ""seizurey"" and didn't want to end up having a seizure around people who don't know how to help me (like my bf or family). 

Idk... I'm feeling kinda down lately with homework and seizures and relationships...

I'd like some advice :)

At 35, he never thought he‚Äôd still be single. His friends were married, starting families, and settling into suburban life, while he found himself in the world of online dating‚Äîagain. He had tried it all: Tinder, Zoosk, Plenty of Fish, and Hinge. Each platform promised the same thing‚Äîconnection‚Äîbut delivered vastly different experiences.

He started with [Tinder](http://tinder.com). It was quick, easy, and full of excitement, at first. Swiping became a game. Matches came quickly, but conversations fizzled just as fast. Dates were more like interviews than connections, with everyone cautiously testing the waters, wondering if someone better was one swipe away. Brendan met a few people through Tinder, but the superficiality of it all left him feeling empty.

Next, he moved to [Zoosk](http://zoosk.com). It seemed like a more serious platform, and Brendan was ready to find something deeper. He crafted a profile, put real thought into his responses, and waited. Zoosk‚Äôs behavioral matchmaking promised to deliver better matches, but Brendan found himself in a loop of ""almosts""‚Äîwomen who seemed great on paper but lacked a real spark in person. There were a few decent conversations, even a couple of nice dates, but nothing ever lasted beyond a few weeks.

Feeling disillusioned, Brendan tried **Plenty of Fish**. The sheer volume of profiles was overwhelming. He waded through pages of potential matches, sending messages and hoping for responses. It felt like he was casting a wide net, but most of what he pulled in didn‚Äôt seem to fit. The conversations here were often brief, and while he did meet a few people who shared similar interests, there was always something missing‚Äîwhether it was chemistry or timing.

Finally, Brendan tried [Hinge](http://hinge.com)

, intrigued by its tagline, ""Designed to be deleted."" It felt different from the start. The prompts were thoughtful, encouraging deeper conversations from the beginning. Brendan found himself matched with women who had similar goals‚Äîfinding something meaningful. He went on a few dates that had real potential. One woman, Mia, stood out. Their first date was filled with laughter, shared stories, and a mutual understanding that they were both tired of the dating scene.

They kept seeing each other, and over time, Brendan realized that while the other dating apps had led to frustration, they also led him here. To this moment, with someone who saw him for who he was.

Sitting across from Mia at a small caf√© one Sunday afternoon, Brendan smiled. Maybe the road to finding love wasn‚Äôt as straightforward as he‚Äôd hoped, but in the end, it was worth the journey.",1,1727895305.0,u_Maximum-Coast-5120,0,1.0,False

Moving to Washington for a new job (job is in Bellevue) and wondering where we should live.

Some additional context:

* My partner and I are 29 and 30
* I will be working in Bellevue 5 days a week, she will be fully remote
* I'm from SoCal, she's from the NE and we've lived in most corners of the US, but we've never visited Seattle (closest I've been is Eureka/Vancouver/Glacier NP)
* We currently reside in Salt Lake City and our life is very outdoor focused (i.e., ski 60+ days a year, MTB 40+ days a year with camping, surfing and fly fishing in between). We'd like to maintain at a least some of this lifestyle (though this will certainly look different for me going in 5 days/week). Next year, we have both Ikon and Epic passes
* We do not currently have touring setups but are all but ready with many side country hikes under belt and a deep relationship with pow. Was planning on getting new setup and avy courses this winter
* We lived in NYC (Manhattan, BK) for three years and while we do miss big city food (e.g., specialty grocery stores, coffee shops, fine dining) and overall walkability, I don't find myself missing night life, traffic or the constant city stimulation - the priority these days is trees and adrenaline
* We have a couple of decent friends in Seattle proper. Living by them would be nice but ultimately not my highest priority

What areas would you recommend we look into? Is the mountain life still of high enough quality to justify centering my life around it or should I just reprioritize towards city/ocean and save money for trips to Baker/Whistler/Interior BC?

Issaquah/Sammamish seems appealing in terms of access to trails/Snoqualmie/night skiing/work (Bellevue) but I have concerns around walkability, food and being younger than everyone who lives there. We certainly don't need a tier 1 city level of food/convenience but having a grocery store within 5-10 minutes drive and at least some food/coffee to walk is ideal.

I've also never skied or biked in PNW - is the cascade cement/crowds that bad? Like not worth it, bad? Stoked for what should be more loamy dirt but concerned around the trail networks coming from Utah (I have fast, flowy black jump lines with deep berms less than 10 minutes from my house).",0,1727895231.0,SeattleWA,22,0.15,False

1funrex,https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1funrex/you_are_in_love_vs_margaret_jack_antonoffs_best/,"""You Are in Love"" vs ""Margaret"": Jack Antonoff's best friends about his relationships","I just watched Maid and went down a Margaret Qually rabbit-hole, just to find out that the song ""Margaret"" is about her. It struck me as specially strange, since I've known for years now that Taylor Swift wrote ""You are in Love"" about Jack's relationship with Lena Dunham. We all know which relationship turned out best, but I wanted delve a little on the similarities and differences between both songs, since they are about the same person in two different relationships.

Margaret is undoubtly the best melody out of the two. It also had the Bleachers and Jack's direct participation, which is absolutely lovely. His voice meshes so nicely with Lana's on it, and his verse is soo beautiful. The song speaks of love at first sight, love that's undeniable and can strike as suddenly as falling from a rooftop. It talks about knowing and being secure/resigned in that knowledge, and accepting that if you are in doubt, then it's not truly love. My favorite lyrics of Margaret are: ""This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend,"" (candid in a way that is almost funny, but turns out heartwarming instead); ""When you know, you know;"" (that whole verse is a masterclass in writing in a way that tickles the ears sooo nicely, but also says an elemental, beautiful, scary truth about love); ""If you're asking yourself, 'How do you know?'/ Then that's your answer, the answer is, 'No'"" (fuck if that ain't the truth, harsh and incredible, but also not the truth, because many things can be true at once; anyway, I love it). ""One that makes me sing / In a minor key"" (meta in a very soulfull way, it immediately makes me think of all the minor-key love songs I adore).

""You Are In Love"", despite not being my favorite melody out of the two, is the one that strikes me as most similar to the Bleachers' production style. ""Margaret"" feels all Lana (even with the feat), while YAIL feels very Taylor-plus-Jack. Jack also participated in the song-writing and production, but he revealed that he didn't know that she song was about his own relationship until a year later when Taylor told him so in an interview for the OG 1989 album. Another key difference is in the storytelling: if you listen to YAIL with your eyes closed, focusing on the words, it feels like a movie. You can see scene by scene in striking detail. Taylor is really good at that, but I think she does a masterful job of it in this song. Lines like: ""Small talk, he drives / Coffee at midnight / The light reflects / The chain on your neck / He says, ""Look up"" / And your shoulders brush / No proof, one touch / But you felt enough"" tell a story vividly with only small, key details. You can read so much between the lines, for an example: ""coffee at midnight"" is an incongruous scene, but it tells about someone who enjoys someonelse's company so much that they just want to be with them, to talk to them, even when it makes no sense. When you're in love you do strange, contradictory shit, like having small talk over coffee at midnight. My favorite lyrics are: ""You can hear it in the silence, silence / You can see it with the lights out, lights out / You are in love, true love"" (that chorus is so smooth and soft to hear, and I love what it says about love); ""You keep his shirt / He keeps his word"" (a simple, beautiful way of telling how the lovers show that they belong to *and* with each other); ""And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars / And why I've spent my whole life tryin' to put it into words"" (those lyrics just make me exhale and think ""yes Taylor, yes girl, thank you"" every time I hear them).

Since YAIL and Margaret are about very different relationships and are, in general, very different songs, it's interesting to point out similarities between the two. The biggest one is the sentiment in the following lines: ""When you know, you know,"" from Margaret and ""You can hear it in the silence (silence),"" from YAIL. You don't need to say it, you don't need to argue about it, you don't need to look for it; when there's love, *you just know*; and *you hear it even in the silence*. Also, interesting is that both are iconic, very well-known lines in both fandoms, often referenced by fans and non-fans. 

One final, key difference that may come across more starkly because of Lana's and Taylor's prefered writing styles: YAIL talks about a relationship where the lovers were friends first. Friends, then best friends, the kind who became glued at the hip, who had coffee together at midnight just to talk, and who eventually looked at one another and realized what they could feel in the silence (love). ""Margaret"", on the other hand, talks about lovers who first met and knew they were in trouble. Who knew it was love immediately. Who met and she was wearing white (marriage), and he wondered if he should jump from a building right away or after drinking a double (impending heartbreak).

My final ruling is: YAIL is my favorite because of the storytelling, and because I like the notion of friends who fall in love. But it's a close battle, since Margaret is a sublime melody softly wrapped in beautiful lyrics. So, I ask you all: what's you favorite and why? Do you disagree with any of my points? Is there anything that my analysis of both songs missed?",8,1727894740.0,lanadelrey,3,1.0,False

My regular symptoms: bloating regardless of what I eat, gas, constipation or diarrhea and reoccurring pimples on my face.

I have tried Low FODMAP for weeks but it did not really seem to improve much.

COFFEE: This is the only way I can really 'go' otherwise I just carry the discomfort with me. I have tried cutting out coffee but even after 2 weeks I still had the usual symptoms + increased constipation.

  
Carnivore: Tried this for a few weeks, similar to low FODMAP I did not see much improvement + I don't eat beef (religious) so it was a bit more difficult to do it with chicken and eggs irritate my stomach alot.

PROBIOTICS (as a supplement or food): Just make everything worse tbh, greek yogurt helps tho.

  
At the moment I start my day with coffee to just clean my system and then try to eat foods that work with me from there. I try to eat single ingredient foods as much as I can. Only supplement I take is marine collagen because other protein powders do not sit well with me.

EXCUSE ME SIR , between the hours of 10-2 , like idk the time frame you allowed me to gather my things that you selectively went through and decided that I was allowed to have back. He also went through all ,I mea all of my papers , notebooks , probably found my journal and went through that as I am yet to find it in my pile of shit. He told me to send him A list of things that I didn‚Äôt get back - so I did,immediately . I also advised that I have receipts for everything that was purchased since the beginning of the year as well. Last but not least , for now, I jad asked him to set up the our family wizard app so that we could solely communicate through there as it would be best. He responded with we no longer need to communicate unless it is solely related to the well-being of our son. 
He has not answered me since , and now , I am concerned I am just going to have to give up a fight that I do not think I even have a chance In winning. I know he‚Äôs withholding these things because I spent my tiny paychecks on them - i make a small amount of money now since I was told I had to work hours that fit his schedule so he didn‚Äôt have to pickup our kid from daycare because it is such an inconvenience . He makes 6 figures and has probably that in his bank account, can afford it all, and has his attorney on standby . (I was a stay at home mom until last fall , and have zero money since I‚Äôve been using it to pay my half of daycare along with my debt ). I can‚Äôt afford an attorney . I had to take a loan out to get myself out . He‚Äôs ready to pull the trigger on the attorney at any given moment and will do anything to destroy my emotional state like he has for years. I am terrified . He knows this is absolutely getting under my skin. He‚Äôs the king of reactive abuse situations. 

 How do I go about getting this stuff back without losing my mind again by having to communicate with him?

If you're someone who loves the simplicity of **meat and bread**, and a straightforward approach to meals, this eating plan could be perfect for you. I've known people who just order meat and bun burgers at the drive through, so those types might especially like this plan. Ground beef and sourdough are the stars of the show, making it easy to stick to a regular routine that keeps you satisfied, well-nourished, and under budget.

Some people refer to this style of eating as **""mono eating""**, where meals are repetitive and focused on a few core ingredients. This approach can be ideal if you enjoy consistency and simplicity without the hassle of meal planning or constantly changing recipes. And the best part? You can feed yourself for **less than $150 per month**! The calorie count would be suitable for a 135 lb female with a desk job.

# What‚Äôs on the Menu?

1. **Ground Beef**: Ground beef is the main protein source, providing not only taste and versatility but also an affordable way to keep your meals filling. By sticking to **70/30 ground beef**, which is rich in flavor, you'll enjoy satisfying burger patties that pack in protein and fats.
   * **Calories per meal (2 quarter-pound patties)**: 500-600 calories
   * **Protein**: 40-44 grams
   * **Fat**: 44-48 grams
2. **Sourdough Flatbread & Toast**: The beauty of sourdough is its versatility. I make flatbreads using **Anna Napolitano Italian flour**, olive oil, and my homemade sourdough starter. These flatbreads, along with sourdough toast from the boule, provide the perfect base for every meal. It's hearty, tangy, and inexpensive.
   * **Calories per flatbread (100g)**: 230-270 calories **Two flatbreads per day**: 460-540 calories
   * **Protein**: 7-9 grams per flatbread **Two flatbreads per day**: 14-18 grams
   * **Fat**: 1-2 grams per flatbread (due to olive oil)
3. **Eggs**: Eggs are another affordable source of protein, perfect for adding variety and balance to the diet. Scrambled eggs, cooked with butter, accompany the sourdough toast to round out breakfast or lunch.
   * **Calories for two scrambled eggs**: 140-160 calories
   * **Protein**: 12-14 grams
   * **Fat**: 10-12 grams (without butter)
   * **Butter adds**: 36 calories, 4 grams of fat
4. **Olive Oil & Butter**: Olive oil and butter add richness and healthy fats to every meal. I use just a teaspoon of olive oil per day, which keeps costs low while still giving that desired flavor and moisture to the flatbreads and eggs. Optional: Duck fat in place of the olive oil would increase the budget only by a few cents a month.
   * **Calories from olive oil (1 tsp)**: 40 calories
   * **Fat**: 4.5 grams
   * **Calories from butter (1 pat for eggs, half for toast)**: 54 calories
   * **Fat**: 6 grams
5. **Salmon Once a Week**: To mix things up, I enjoy a **salmon fillet** once a week, which replaces one of the daily ground beef meals. Salmon adds a nice change in texture and taste, while providing valuable omega-3 fatty acids for heart and brain health.
   * **Calories per salmon fillet (0.7 lb)**: 280-350 calories
   * **Protein**: 40-45 grams
   * **Fat**: 20-22 grams (healthy fats, including omega-3s)
6. **Coffee**: A small indulgence I allow myself each day is a cup of coffee. It‚Äôs a simple pleasure, and even with 15 grams of coffee per day, it fits easily into the budget.
   * **Calories**: Virtually zero (if black)
   * **Cost**: About 34 cents per day
7. **Water**: Once I started this way of eating, I stopped hating the taste of water, which was nice, so a big glass of chilled water is my beverage with meals.

# Daily Calories and Macros Breakdown (on a typical day without salmon):

* **Calories**: **Sourdough flatbread (2)**: 460-540 calories **Ground beef**: 500-600 calories **Eggs**: 176-196 calories **Sourdough toast**: 130-150 calories **Olive oil**: 40 calories **Butter**: 54 calories **Total daily calories**: **1,360 - 1,580 calories**
* **Protein**: **Ground beef**: 40-44 grams **Sourdough flatbread**: 14-18 grams **Eggs**: 12-14 grams **Total protein**: **66-76 grams**
* **Fat**: **Ground beef**: 44-48 grams **Sourdough flatbread**: 2-4 grams **Eggs and butter**: 16-18 grams **Olive oil**: 4.5 grams **Total fat**: **66-74 grams**

# Daily Calories and Macros Breakdown (on salmon day):

* **Calories**: **Salmon fillet**: 280-350 calories **Sourdough flatbread (2)**: 460-540 calories **Eggs**: 176-196 calories **Sourdough toast**: 130-150 calories **Olive oil**: 40 calories **Butter**: 54 calories **Total salmon day calories**: **1,140 - 1,330 calories**
* **Protein**: **Salmon**: 40-45 grams **Sourdough flatbread**: 14-18 grams **Eggs**: 12-14 grams **Total protein**: **66-77 grams**
* **Fat**: **Salmon**: 20-22 grams **Sourdough flatbread**: 2-4 grams **Eggs and butter**: 16-18 grams **Olive oil**: 4.5 grams **Total fat**: **42-48 grams**

# Total Monthly Cost: Under $150

I purchase everything at Walmart except the ground beef, which I buy at a local grocer that routinely runs monthly or bi-weekly sales on ground beef for **$3.99 per pound**. I stock up on the ground beef when it's on sale, making it easy to stay within my budget.

To give you an idea of how affordable this eating plan is, here‚Äôs the cost breakdown:

* **Ground beef**: $3.99 per pound, with two quarter-pound patties per day.
* **Sourdough flatbreads**: Using Anna Napolitano flour, each flatbread costs about 32 cents to make.
* **Eggs**: At 26.4 cents each, two eggs cost only 53 cents.
* **Olive oil & butter**: Minimal amounts of each keep costs low but provide great flavor.
* **Salmon**: Once a week, I enjoy a fillet at $8.17 per serving.
* **Coffee**: For a daily cup, I use about 34 cents' worth of coffee beans.

# Weekly and Monthly Costs:

* **Daily cost**: About $4.16 per day (without salmon).
* **Salmon day cost**: About $11.34 (including salmon fillet).
* **Weekly cost**: $36.32 per week.
* **Monthly cost**: $145.28 per month.

1funf6m,https://i.redd.it/simjwudnzdsd1.jpeg,New machine teething problems [Sage dose control pro and Sage dual boiler machine],"Hi all I recently upgraded my old gaggia classic to the sage dual boiler(see my previous post) and I'm really struggling to get my shots dialed in. I'm still using the sage dose control pro grinder I know it's not the best grinder out there but an upgrade probably isn't on the cards so soon after convincing my wife that we needed a new machine. My problem is that I can get the grinder dialed in and get a perfect shot reasonably easily but the next morning or evening I find it's either to fine or too coarse. So for example this morning I was getting around 60g from 17g of coffee in around 32 seconds and after dialing back the grinder I was able to get a more acceptable 35 grams extraction in the same time.
Still a little bitter but much better than the first shot.
When I came home this evening I decided to pull another shot and found that without touching any of the settings from this morning I was barely getting anything out and had to increase the grind size back to where it was before to get an acceptable shot. I can't work out if this is just an issue with the grinder.
I didnt have any issues with the gaggia classic but now I'm wondering if maybe I did but didn't notice as much because no shot timer and any issues with the extraction would be put down to temperature fluctuations in the boiler (my main reason for changing to a machine with PID temperature control). The beans I'm using are not particularly expensive so that may be my issue they are lofbergs Brazilian beans from Tesco (UK) it's a reasonably dark roast. I've been using them for a while with no issues.",1,1727893887.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We‚Äôre very flirty over snap - she calls me cute/handsome, I reciprocate, we both say some freaky shit.

Problem is whenever we hang out it‚Äôs either buzzed at a party (I‚Äôm in a fraternity so we host a lot of parties and she‚Äôs nearly always there) or something very brief that she planned (like a 20 minute coffee ‚Äúdate‚Äù) and whenever I try to initiate she *always* hits me with the dreaded ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know‚Äù and proceeds to in fact not let me know.

I‚Äôm making this post coming off me, yesterday, asking if she‚Äôs free that night cause I wanna see her. She says she‚Äôs going to bed cuz she has work early in the morning, and she says sorry but also says ‚ÄúTomorrow night I‚Äôm all yours!!!!‚Äù (exact quote, including exclamations).

Flash forward to today I ask if I can pick her up at 9pm and she once again hits me with ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know‚Äù.

So is she just fucking with me? It‚Äôs starting to get pretty frustrating.

I'm an international student in Turkey, and about a year ago, I met this amazing Turkish girl in my class. I was really drawn to her, so I asked her out. We had a great first date‚Äîdinner followed by hours of deep conversation at a coffee shop. She opened up, and we really clicked. After that, we made plans to meet again, but she canceled last minute, saying we could hang out another time. This pattern kept repeating‚Äîshe‚Äôd suggest a day, then cancel last-minute.

Eventually, I asked her if something was wrong, and she said she didn‚Äôt want a relationship. I felt hurt, so I stopped reaching out as often, but I still texted her every month or so. I dated a few other girls in the meantime, but honestly, I couldn‚Äôt get over her. She‚Äôs smart, beautiful, and we had such a great connection. It‚Äôs been tough.

For an entire term, she distanced herself from me. It felt like she completely broke my heart. But last week, we started texting again, and I mentioned that I‚Äôm over it now, and she doesn‚Äôt need to keep her distance. We saw each other in class a couple of days ago and talked briefly. She suggested we hang out this Friday to ‚Äúfix things,‚Äù but only as friends. I agreed, but I‚Äôm torn because I still have strong feelings for her. I don‚Äôt want to get friendzoned, but after almost a year, it‚Äôs been hard to move on.

What should I do? Should I go meet her as friends and see where it leads, or is it time to accept that this won‚Äôt go anywhere and cut ties for good? I‚Äôm really conflicted and could use some outside perspectives.

I've had TMJ for about a year now and have tried a long list of things that I've seen on her to try to improve it.  The list so far includes:

* Botox about 4 months ago
* Dentist top night guard
* Physical therapy (currently doing sessions)
* Magnesium Glycinate and Citrate separately
* Gave up coffee and alcohol with minimal noticeable differences
* new pillow for back sleeping
* Working on trap exercises currently at gym to help neck/head posture

None of these things have completely fixed the issues and I still suffer quite a bit on a day to day basis having difficulty speaking at work and at home, avoiding a lot of foods and just having general jaw pain.  I feel that my teeth have become more of an overbite and my bite is slightly uneven now.  Also notice some bone growth inside my mouth and along my gums on top and bottom which worries me.

In my local area the ""TMJ Specialist"" charges around $4000 for a one size fits all approach and has a lot of terrible reviews online so I am apprehensive of going that route and being the next unhappy patient for him.  I've spoken to my doctor about the issue and she only could offer to refer me to the TMJ specialist mentioned above or put me on an antidepressant which i dont want to do.

I ended up dropping ML this year because I felt like I wasn't learning anything for the hours I was spending. I was getting gut pain from the coffee i was drinking to pull all nighters on the assignments I was running on google colab running CPU based algorithms (i.e. they were really slow but still faster than what I could do locally).

I thought it would be a math heavy class but instead ML seemed very light on the theory and heavy on the experimentation. Unfortunately for someone like me who always has assignment OCD this meant I never felt ""done"" per assignment and easily sank 100+ hours on A1. 

I read that DL is a bit of a different story. Now that I have more time I would love to really get up to snuff on the calculus, linear algebra, and probability as preparation needed to understand deep learning thoroughly if I decide to take it next sem.

I'm curious if DL is the same as ML where there is that ""infinite pit"" of hours that can be put in on vague assignments or if its more focused? I.e. is the 20 hour workload actually consistent or does it have the same variability as ML where one student can finish an assignment in 15 hours, the other in 100 and both still get the same grade.

I'm doing the HCI specialization so I don't need to take ML.

Basically, I want the synth to pull forward over my DJ gear when in use, and push back when not.

I'm sure I can build something with some lift hinges if need be, but if theres a premade solution that can clamp to the desk, that will be a much quicker solution.

* Mechanical engineer with a few years' experience in testing, need somewhere with a decent amount of manufacturing or technical work.
* Low-to-moderate COL; coming from Massachusetts, that means ""basically anywhere but the Bay or Manhattan"" for me.
* Late 20s and single; lack of nightlife isn't a dealbreaker for me, but I'd like to have decent options for a social life. Think tabletop gaming, makerspaces, coffee shops, stuff like that. Not thinking super hard about starting a family or raising kids. 
* Queer and Jewish, would like to not get Deliveranced.
* This one's the real filter - I'm into shooting and gun collecting as a hobby, so I'd like somewhere with pretty permissive gun laws.

I'm cross-shopping Minneapolis and Pittsburgh rn, with those criteria. They both tick my boxes pretty well, but which do we think does it better?

I met a guy we‚Äôll call Tim via hinge last month. We are both brand new to the city where we live and are in the process of moving and meeting people. We went out on one official drink date, and two very casual running dates. We then decided to friend zone (his idea) and I wasn‚Äôt mad about it bc he has been super inconsistent with communication and not asking me out. Went out with group of friends one night, I looked cute and Tim drank a bunch and told me he regretted friend zoning. The next day we met up, decided to revisit the romantic connection and made out at his place, which was our only physical intimacy to date. This weekend we went out to dinner with a bunch of friends, where I met Tim‚Äôs friend, who we‚Äôll call Bob. Tim and Bob were both at the other end of the table during dinner so I didn‚Äôt talk to either one during the meal. After dinner we went to a bar and Bob and I kinda hit it off. We were chatting it up at the bar and he is SO fun and engaging and totally my type in a way that I now realize Tim never could be. The three of us were all sitting together initially and Bob and I were so into the convo that Tim couldn‚Äôt keep up and went to the other end of the bar to talk to the others in the group instead. I think Bob was kind of into me. We went on to a second bar and Tim had had more booze and was being more into me like close talking and buying my drinks and even though I knew in my heart I just wanted to hang more with Bob, I got swept up in the current of things already in motion and went along with it. Bob left the bar and went home. Night goes on, Tim and I are fairly affectionate with each other just talking to one another primarily and being ‚Äúcouply‚Äù (one of his other friends saw us holding hands in our uber to the second bar) but not kissing or anything super intimate. We end up going home together to his place, and his other friends who were with us all night, who are a long term couple, bid us farewell and watched us get into an Uber home together. Tim and I fooled around that night  - to be very precise we got naked in complete darkness, made out, and I went down on him a bit but didn‚Äôt finish him. We didn‚Äôt have sex. 

Tim said some weird stuff that night sort of laying claim to me but also not indicating he was sufficiently available for a serious relationship in the way I want. He also totally blew me off for the plans we made to get coffee and pastries Sunday morning (the morning after). I decided I‚Äôm not down with this hot and cold energy so we met up in the afternoon and I told him we are better off as friends. He agrees and we‚Äôve hung out since and it‚Äôs been fine. He is also meeting/dating other women which I think is great. 
 
My question is did I totally botch this where Bob is now off limits to me? He and Tim are friends from college and close but not mega close but if I can tactfully figure this out I would really like to pursue something with Bob. We are all 33-35 years old.

---------------

 clink. clink. clink. 

The sound of tools tapping gently, oh so gently, but persistently against ancient stone. Probing, penetrating, fumbling and correcting, until‚Ä¶ the door of the ancient burial chamber finally opened, allowing the first rays of torchlight that the room had seen in countless centuries. 

‚ÄúYe gods, I thought it would never give-‚Äú

‚ÄúNext time let me do that, it would save some time.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLook! This has to be it! Amon-Toth‚Äôs burial chamber, at long last! You were right, MacReady!‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, well‚Ä¶ naturally!‚Äù Boomed a rather self-important, boisterous voice. ‚ÄúTake a good look, men. Ancient even to the ancients! And believed to be a myth for almost a millennium. So what do you say to those superstitious native guides now, eh, Svenson?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, yes,‚Äù grumbled the voice that belonged to Svenson. 

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs the old blighter‚Äôs sarcophagus itself. The foremost priest, architect, and scientist in the world- adviser to a whole dynasty! Some even called him a sorcerer.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a legend, MacReady.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that! But poetic license-‚Äú

‚ÄúLook at these grave goods,‚Äù someone breathed. ‚ÄúPriceless, completely priceless!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot that it matters,‚Äù another said.

‚ÄúYes, quite. We should hurry up and get some photographs and maybe some preliminary plan maps of the layout-‚Äú 

There came a sudden and concerning rumbling noise. 

‚ÄúOh God. That‚Äôs not good. I told you that dynamite was a bad idea, MacReady-‚Äú 

‚ÄúShit. Look, just take what you can-‚Äú 

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt-‚Äú

‚ÄúSvenson, I am not going back home empty handed. Screw protocol just this once.‚Äù 

As the rumbling continued, grasping, shadowy hands busied themselves about the tomb, until finally the warning signs were too great to ignore, then the figures hurriedly departed. In a somewhat comical twist of fate, had they stayed in the chamber, they might have seen the chamber survive the collapse of the tomb‚Äôs main corridor. 

But, had they stayed, that would have been a secondary matter for them, for, had they stayed, they would have seen the lid of the sarcophagus creak eerily open, a withered hand clutching its edge, and a shambling, horrific form emerge to say‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this? I was only asleep for a few millennia!‚Äù 

‚Ä¶ roughly translated, of course. 

*** 



Amon-Toth, in his day the foremost priest, architect and scientist in the world, adviser to an entire dynasty and, it must be said, something of a dabbler in the fields of alchemy and sorcery, had been in the modern world for about a month. So far, he was not enjoying himself. 

Awakening from an extended nap (his suspended animation formula, it seemed, was an unqualified success), he had discovered his entire treasure trove plundered. The cult he had organized to protect his tomb had clearly slacked off (as he would learn later, they had disbanded to form a nonprofit dolphin sanctuary). Extricating himself from the ruins of his hidden tomb by hand did little to improve Amon-Toth‚Äôs mood, and his consternation only worsened the more he learned of the modern world.

For one thing, his home country had become overrun by obnoxious tourists (who, at least, were a good source of organs to replace those of his which had decayed into dust). For another, everything seemed to cost something, and there didn‚Äôt seem to be any market nowadays for a master of forbidden arts (working at the local grocery outlet was a perennial annoyance). And as a minor point, there seemed to be some new trend of drinking some kind of sludge made of Ethiopian herbs. They called it ‚Äúcoffee.‚Äù 

Amon-Toth was nursing a mug of it now, outside a small, dirty cafe, only because none of the cafes in this prefecture seemed to carry barley beer, goat milk, or even fig juice. What a disgrace. 

In his month-long adjustment period, Amon-Toth had totally failed to track down his misappropriated treasure. Through threats and questioning he had managed to locate one of the tomb robbers, a white-skinned man from the far west and north who used the name Svenson, who had an apartment in the bloated overgrowth of the city. But the terrified man had only insisted that the treasure was stolen by his commander, one MacReady by name, who had fled the country with it. That was not news Amon-Toth had wished to hear. 

Amon-Toth was aware of a small child staring at him, probably transfixed by the rotting skin and mask of tattered bandages. Amon-Toth hissed to scare the urchin off.  

‚ÄúRough couple of days?‚Äù Said a voice the sorcerer did not recognize. Amon-Toth looked up to behold a woman with pale skin- another westerner like the late Svenson, no doubt. That would have put Amon-Toth on edge, except- he realized with a start- she was speaking in a language he could understand. At least, one better than the garbled heathen tongues everyone else was using nowadays. 

 ‚ÄúYou speak the Liturgy,‚Äù the old sorcerer rasped through his withered throat, amazed. ‚ÄúThe tongue of the magisters.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. It was still around in my day. In‚Ä¶ select circles. But how about you, eh? Must be a three thousand, maybe a four thousand?‚Äù

It took Amon a moment to realize he was being asked his age. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm used to dealing with under-thousands. Now here you come along making me feel like a spring chicken. But I‚Äôm babbling. You can call me Cora. I was sent to find you. By‚Ä¶ friends. Or colleagues, at least. We want to help you out with a little problem we understand you‚Äôre having.‚Äù 

Amon thought about it a moment. ‚ÄúAnd who are these colleagues, friend Cora?‚Äù  

*** 

 The Council of Immortals kept meeting-halls across the globe. Naturally they had not neglected to establish one in this city, which fairly dropped with history. Even immortals did not reach advanced age without learning to adapt to the endlessly changing world, but none of them could escape from nostalgia.   

The building itself was discreet, Brownstone-esque, large enough to be comfortable, not terribly ostentatious. Something about it discouraged spectators. Passerby might take it for a clubhouse for some secretive fraternity, which was accurate, though the residents had rather more secrets to keep than one‚Äôs local Masonic lodge. 

Cora opened the front door for Amon and guided him through a cozy looking, dimly lit parlor, at the terminus of which two figures sat conversing mildly in front of a fire. Both conversants paused and looked toward Amon pointedly as he neared. 

Cora came to his rescue, holding up her right hand to show an ornate signet ring. 

‚ÄúMadam Sycorax, fifteen hundred. And guest,‚Äù she said, evidently by way of introduction. 

The two in the chairs responded in kind, dutifully. First, an austere man, clad in saffron robes, whose skin was the tawny-and-cream of the eastern mountains showed his own  ring and announced himself: ‚ÄúDiXian Lu. Thirteen hundred.‚Äù Then up spoke the other, an Iberian-looking man with a pointed beard and an unusual amount of golden jewelry. ‚ÄúSantiago de Alvarado, six hundred.‚Äù Both spoke in the Liturgy, Amon noted.

The introductions made, all parties present relaxed. ‚ÄúGood to see a new face about,‚Äù the Iberian said, in an unctuous tone. 

‚ÄúJust here to show our guest to the Retrieval Bureau,‚Äù Cora-Sycorax chirped casually. 

‚ÄúAh, well, you know the way. Just so long as I don‚Äôt have to get up.‚Äù 

As Amon was guided through the hallways he was struck by the house‚Äôs peculiar membership. From every time period they came, from the Frenchman in his powdered wig (‚ÄúCount St. Germain, three hundred‚Äù) to the armored and four-armed woman who seemed to be from the land of frankincense (‚ÄúLakshmibai, twelve hundred.‚Äù)

Every means of prolonging human life was represented, from alchemy to vampirism to divine heritage to Satanic bargaining to blasphemous science. Every walk of life as well; clearly some club members clearly had grown rich of eternal investments while unfortunate others seemed little more than beggars. Still, all were treated with respect.  

 ‚ÄúAnd this Retrieval Bureau,‚Äù said Amon-Toth at last, after what seemed an eternity of navigating hallways. ‚ÄúWhat are they to me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúA special branch of our little society, dedicated to getting our property back from mortal who don‚Äôt know better than to go snapping it up. Normally only nonmembers are eligible, but, well, the first hit is free. At least, so long as we clear it with the chairman.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey can be relied upon?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can. In the past they‚Äôve gotten Lord Popoca‚Äôs golden breastplate out of Mexico City, Jarl Halfdane‚Äôs favorite drinking horn out of Stockholm and even helped fumigate a nice Templar fortress of some annoying foreigners who‚Äôd decided to move in. Sometimes a sternly written letter is enough, but sometimes they have to get a bit‚Ä¶ rougher. And here we are.‚Äù

Cora knocked on a rather ordinary looking door at the end of a hallway, and a strange, mangled voice from inside said‚Ä¶ something. 

Cora looked to Amon with amusement. ‚ÄúThe chairman doesn‚Äôt speak Liturgy well. Or any other modern language, really. He says he‚Äôs waiting to see if any last five thousand years, to be sure he isn‚Äôt wasting time learning them. Let‚Äôs go in.‚Äù

The man behind the desk- the chairman- barely looked like a man. In some ways he looked rather more like a shaved gorilla, crammed into a very nice white suit with a mauve ascot. He was filling out forms with an impatient look on his face, but looked up as the two came in to his office. 

The chairman grunted. Cora held up her ring again, made the same introduction as before, and the chairman responded by lifting his own signet ring, barking out a series of unintelligible grunts, and finishing with a heavily accented ‚Äúone hundred fifty thousand.‚Äù  ",1,1727892544.0,StoriesPlentiful,1,1.0,False

I took Andrew Ramadayal‚Äôs 35 hr prep course (listening at 1.7x speed) about 14 weeks before the exam and used just his materials and PMI Study Hall to practice. I studied sporadically in between. I did all the practice questions and mini exams, as well as one practice exam (81%, including expert questions). You can see my percentiles and such in the image.¬†



I thought the questions in the real exam were quite similar to the better SH questions (some of the SH questions are just weird and sloppy), but really required application of the mindset, not just memorization. I found getting familiar with question formats, reviewing wrong answers, and thus learning how to identify questions types/answer patterns to be the most helpful thing.¬†



I did create some one-pagers (posted) but I found the process of writing them out was more helpful than reading them. I didn‚Äôt memorize the ITTOs or 49 processes, but I understood the major activities, inputs, and outputs of each of the 5 major phases. I procrastinated the test a lot and didn‚Äôt study consistently or even read the PMBOK, but I did write out the formulas many, many, times, so I¬† knew my EVM, PERT, Standard Deviation, and other formula (but barely had to use them).



Time management is real - keep a cool head and note ahead of time a few time marking milestones per section in your head so you can make sure you‚Äôre keeping on track without constantly doing mental math. Take the full ten minute breaks even if just to pee, drink some water/coffee, breathe, and settle your adrenaline/nerves. I finished all questions on time but became crunched in trying to review my flags, and didn‚Äôt get to really spend time on each one.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt as fried at the end as I thought I‚Äôd be. Thanks for everyone‚Äôs input - thought I‚Äôd pay it forward by posting this. You can do this!

1fumsyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fumsyl/faced_with_fear/,Faced With Fear,"¬†Nightmarish. Jolting upright, after a sleep‚Äôs worth of squeamish dreams of sickness and sorrow, towards my phone I turned off the alarms that pierced my ears, seeming to hit my brain like stones.

¬†I hadn‚Äôt slept well. This was not unusual by any means. Horrors from day-to-day, from global to personal, followed me to slumber and held me captive there till waking. However, now it was 4:30AM. Time to ready for the workday, which was a thirteen-hour shift at an oil pipeline, where I sat in my car as a gate guard. I‚Äôd gotten the gig two weeks ago, when the previous gate guard who worked my spot went missing. Easy job for the most part. I‚Äôm in Texas, so the heat is suffocating some days and for some hours, but the hardest part is keeping myself occupied, entertained, and sane.

No meagre feat.

I begin my coffee‚Äôs brew and pack my things. I dress, finish my coffee, brush my teeth, and head out the door. The night is a rich, deep dark. So black that I can‚Äôt see anything around me. I unlock my car to trigger her headlights, so I‚Äôm able to see my way to her. The drive is eerie, quiet, and puts me on edge. My headlights illuminate only just enough to see the way, and out of their reach in the beginnings of shadows I swear I see a deer on the roadside. Except, it looked like it had a human‚Äôs face. I blink, and once my eyes are open again, I am passing where I thought the deer had stood, nothing there now.

¬†The world still asleep, the time just reaching 5:45AM, I arrive at my gate fifteen minutes early.

‚ÄúFuck‚Äù, I breathe out, irritated. I reach into my pocket and find the gate‚Äôs keys, readying myself to unlock it. *I‚Äôm already here thirteen hours, why did I leave fifteen minutes earlier than usual today, I could‚Äôve slept in if anyth*-

I‚Äôm outside unlocking the gate, distracted by pissy thoughts, when a sound brings me to a pause. Talking. I hear talking somewhere in the pitch black. I can‚Äôt distinguish the voice, nor place where it‚Äôs coming from. Forest and brush surrounds me. No one is supposed to be out here this early with me, hell the gate ain‚Äôt even unlocked yet, but I definitely hear a voice.

¬†‚Äú*Hey! Hey,* ***you****,‚Äù* Someone whispers in the dark. Immediately my hairs are stood, and I shake with fear. I still can‚Äôt place where it‚Äôs coming from. Knots form in my stomach, tangling terror around my organs and spreading to my chest and throat. The voice sounded *wrong*.

‚Äú*You, you, hey you, you, hey you, you, you,‚Äù* the voice jeers again, and I begin to understand my dread. The voice is familiar somehow, but distorted and the emphasis is in the wrong parts of words, the cadence changing constantly.

¬†I‚Äôm still standing by the gate, unknown distance between me and the voice. I bite my fear and chew courage into my cheek, beginning to start towards my car when I see it. The deer. The one I‚Äôd seen on my way. My eyes are adjusted to the darkness enough to make it out just so. It stands inside the brush.

¬†Fright seizes my body and I bite harder, cheek blood pooling into my mouth.

The deer, which is *not* a deer, does indeed have a human face. A recognizable one. But, before I‚Äôm able to process the face further to decide it, the lips part and speak.

‚ÄúYou, you, youuUUuu‚Äôre *bleeding*,‚Äù the voice moans, drawing out it‚Äôs words and changing their pitch in what I can only describe as excitement. The face‚Äôs lips are parted, but they aren‚Äôt moving to shape the words, rather just hanging open limply. The cheeks are gaunt, and there is an expression of pain and fear etched into the muscles. The eyes are wide open, but they look uncanny and wicked. I realize the face itself has no eyes, only holes in which another being looks through with its own judgements. The deer is wearing a human‚Äôs face as a mask. My fear strengthens tenfold as I recognize the face as the missing gate guard, the man whose position I‚Äôd taken; the face which consumed every flyer, local social media post and news outlet the last two weeks.

I remember a post I‚Äôd seen of the man, made by his girlfriend. A video of them plays in my head, his laughter and speech ringing through it. This thing is wearing his face and parroting his voice.

The deer steps forward once, my car‚Äôs headlights revealing it‚Äôs form, the distance between us somehow significantly shortened as though it had taken twenty steps instead. It looks less like a deer now in the light, but more so something sculpted from the memory of a deer. The proportions are off, and there are extra features and appendages. To my horror, a cloak wraps the thing‚Äôs shoulders made up of faces stitched skillfully with twine. I recognize many from missing posters throughout the years; faces of different ages, races, and identities sewn into a large, long sheet which blankets their collector. Slender, humanoid arms emerge from beneath the cloak and the hands reach up to the creature‚Äôs face. It caresses the frame of the human mask gently but doesn‚Äôt remove it. Instead, it remains that way for a moment, stroking the skin almost lovingly. It never takes its eyes off me, nor mine it.

¬†‚ÄúI *liked* this *one*,‚Äù It finally croaks. One of the hands reaches towards me.

¬†‚Äú*Please*,‚Äù I request, the words *don‚Äôt hurt me* dying in my throat. I taste blood on my lips and realize it has smeared across the lower half of my face from the wound in my cheek. The thing pauses, It‚Äôs eyes shut and It breathes in deeply. After this, once It‚Äôs eyes open again, It is different. More intentional, calculated, and ready.

¬†‚ÄúYours however is my favorite‚Äù It says, but the voice sounds different now. It sounds like mine, an obvious panic audible under the cheerful delivery. It gurgles and distorts as the thing speaks, but nonetheless *that* voice is *mine*. ‚ÄúBe careful with it.‚Äù

¬†It extends It‚Äôs arm to meet my lips, and presses a cold thumb into them to wipe away some of the blood. That is the last thing I remember before waking up on the ground, my back to the earth and face looking towards the sky. Feet stomp around me; some run, some move quickly, and some frozen. I sit up and look around, seeing my supervisor, cops, and other gate guards moving around the vicinity. They are all serious, panicked even. Some call out my name.

¬†‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I try to call, but the words are caught inside my mouth, a muffled sound escaping me instead. I wave my hands around, and stomp, and try to force the words from me. No one seems to see me, and I am unheard.

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking know, man,‚Äù my supervisor grunts to a cop, ‚ÄúGate ain‚Äôt even unlocked. Don‚Äôt have a god damn *clue* what could‚Äôve happened. He should‚Äôve been the only one out here.‚Äù He gestures to keys on the ground, which are marked. I recognize them as my gate‚Äôs keys. My hands fly to the pocket I keep them in, and of course find nothing. I stagger to my supervisor and grab his arm. I‚Äôm desperate to alert him I am *right* here. He doesn‚Äôt even *feel* me.

¬†In the reflection of his sunglasses, which hang from his collared uniform, I see myself there. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôm able to accomplish this, as I have no eyes. I don‚Äôt have any of my features. My face is gone.

¬†Movement reflects behind me, and I spin around. In the wood, I see faceless bodies disappear behind trees and bushes, hiding from what approaches me. The missing man‚Äôs face has been quilted into the cloak, my face replacing the creature‚Äôs old mask. An arm extends from the cloak, reaching towards It‚Äôs face and mimicking a falling tear with one finger, drawing the end of the gesture into a *shhh* position on my lifeless lips.

While on our walk, we saw the most realistic looking Halloween decor. It was a scary looking little girl on a swing. We ran back and forth trying to trigger the sensor so it would move. It did, and we watched as it swung back and forth. It was so realistic and we could not get over how scary it was.

We got back and had a great dinner with my sister and her girlfriend, talked for awhile, and then hit up Target for some last second ingredients for today's dinner. We took our time and danced to the music in the store.

Came back home and turned on the Golden Bachelorette. Watched it, cried, and laughed.

Woke up this morning and was preparing my lunch for the day when my wife came down and told me she wanted to make her new oatmeal recipe for me. We laughed and cooked our food and it was relaxing yet everything I needed to wake up and feel ready for the work day. She made a new pumpkin coffee recipe, as well, which we both swooned over when we tried it.

There was nothing out of the ordinary about this last day, but the pure bliss that I experienced says otherwise.",300,1727892279.0,BenignExistence,13,0.99,False

Im average guy but I am picky I guess because well I like to get to know my partner first before we get super official.

So last few relationships have had me(m27)conflicted. I had a 2 year relationship that honestly wasn't bad, she did have a lot of baggage from previous relationship, she was 3 years younger than me. She decided she didn't want to continue the relationship because I asked if she wanted to move in with me, and since she did not and well I lived in California at the time I was debating on moving to build a better life with a decent job lined up. She then stated she misses me and while we are not meant to be she knows what to look for in a man now since I'm the only one to ever treat her right.

Fast-forward I moved to a different state, have an okay job. I know I need to work on myself so I have been. An old coworker that I worked years ago with who had an apparent crush on me reached out. I knew her brothers etc. was friends with them etc. well we started off with coffee and hikes etc. talking about our dislikes our likes and hopes for the future. We both agreed hey let's take things slow. Now she wanted to be an actress and maybe move to New York or somewhere she could have more acting opportunities. I told her I only been to New York once but I couldn't see myself living in the big of a city. We talked more and still hung out. She told me through out the relationship she would eventually want to move to New York and I said well I could consider it but I really don't see myself moving there. I suggested Texas since Austin apparently has some actors from there it was close the ocean like she wanted, it was warmer weather etc. the airport in Dallas would be a direct flight to wherever she wanted to act. Id do my best to support her dreams and me myself I would want to run a small business. She seemed to like the idea but also would have to consider it. She mentioned multiple times through out the relationship she couldn't believe how amazing I was etc. and she even said she was like I wasn't expecting to run into someone like you. But then she said we have to different of goals and don't think things may work but I'm the ideal guy she could ever want.

What am I doing wrong at this point? Mean they want to be friends afterwards but I try to minimize it because well it's not healthy in my opinion. So I assume I'm not terrible but I'm confused at this point. Want some perspective from others ",1,1727892269.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1fumqzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1fumqzv/topiramate_advice_for_meyou/,Topiramate advice for me/you,"I've been saying how Topirimate has been helpful for me. I want to write some reminders for myself (and others) about this medication.

For me, medication is not a cure-all. It helps. But if I'm taking a medication, eating poorly, sleeping bad, overly stressed, spending too much time on social media, not drinking enough water...etc...is it fair for me to blame the medication for giving me problems / side efffects?

I had a bad weekend with migraine, and I was tempted to blame the topiramate for feeling worse. But I cut out coffee, and I also cut out eating right before bed. Seems I'm doing better again. I've postulated that for me Topiramate is aiding me in finding other triggers for myself. I got Tyramine and nuts figured out now. But perhaps I do need to dial down the caffeine and eating before bed as well. I wonder if I have some silent reflux going on. Might take out my sparkling water too to see if that calms things down some more. 

It's different for us all, but keep the whole picture in mind.
