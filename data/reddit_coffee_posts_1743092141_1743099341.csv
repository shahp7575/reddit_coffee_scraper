1jlakca,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/1jlakca/i_came_up_with_a_new_job_idea_hire_an_emotion/,I Came Up with a New Job Idea: Hire an ‘Emotion Coach’ to Feel Whatever You Want for an Hour. Thoughts?,"I’ve been brainstorming this wild idea for a new kind of service, and I’m super curious to hear what you all think: an ‘Emotion Coach on Demand.’ The basic concept is that you hire someone to help you experience a specific emotion or practice handling tricky social situations in a safe, controlled way. It’s like a mix of improv theater, therapy, and a social experiment—all rolled into one!

Here’s how it works: you pick the emotion you want to feel—like frustration, joy, embarrassment, or even confidence—or you can choose a specific scenario that fits your vibe. For example, want to get better at dealing with rude people? The coach can pretend to be a jerk who cuts in line at Starbucks while you practice staying calm. Need a mood boost after a rough week? They’ll stage a random act of kindness, like complimenting your outfit in the middle of a park, to make your day. Or maybe you’re prepping for a big presentation and want to practice handling a heckler—they can role-play that too!

You can do it in-person (think public places like a café, park, or mall) or online via Zoom or FaceTime if you’d rather keep it virtual. Sessions start at $15 for 30 minutes, or $25 for a full hour. There are some cool add-ons too:

•	Feedback Mode (+$10): After the session, the coach gives you personalized tips on how to handle similar situations in real life—like how to stay cool when someone’s being a jerk, or how to set boundaries without feeling awkward.
•	Extreme Mode (+$15): For the adrenaline junkies! This could be a lighthearted public prank (nothing too crazy, of course) or a more intense role-play scenario to really push your limits.
•	Group Experience ($50/hour for up to 4 people): Perfect for a fun night out with friends, a bachelorette party, or even a team-building event. Imagine hiring a coach to play an ‘overly enthusiastic stranger’ who crashes your group hangout—it’d be hilarious!
•	Online Discount: If you go virtual, you get 15% off, so it’s a bit more budget-friendly.

I think this could be awesome for a ton of different people. If you’re into personal growth, it’s a great way to work on your emotional intelligence or social skills—like learning how to deal with conflict without losing your cool. If you’re prepping for something stressful, like a job interview, a tough convo with your boss, or even a first date, you can use this to practice and build confidence. Or, if you’re just someone who loves unique experiences, this could be a fun way to shake up your routine and have a good laugh. Plus, imagine the TikToks or Instagram Reels you could make with this—‘I hired someone to pretend to be a rude customer, and here’s how it went!’

I’ve been thinking about some potential scenarios to offer, but I’d love to hear your ideas too. Here are a few I came up with:

•	‘Rude Customer’: The coach acts like an entitled customer at a fake coffee shop while you practice keeping your cool.
•	‘Overly Enthusiastic Coworker’: They play a coworker who won’t stop talking about their new hobby while you try to get work done.
•	‘Awkward First Date’: They act like a super awkward date who overshares way too much—perfect for practicing how to handle weird social situations.
•	‘Random Act of Kindness’: They surprise you with a heartfelt compliment or a small gift in public to boost your mood.
•	‘Heckler at a Presentation’: They interrupt your fake speech with silly questions to help you practice staying confident under pressure.

There’s also a safety net built in: before the session, you’d set clear boundaries with the coach to make sure everything stays fun and comfortable. They’d be trained to read the room and adjust on the fly, so it never gets too intense unless you want it to. I’m thinking of calling it something catchy like ‘FeelFix’ or ‘EmotionRx’ to make it sound professional but approachable.

So, what do you guys think? Would you try something like this? What scenarios would you want to experience? If you’ve ever done something similar—like improv classes, escape rooms, or even pranks with friends—I’d love to hear about it! Also, any ideas for how to make this even better? I’m all ears! 😄",1,1743099230.0,CrazyIdeas,0,1.0,False

This is so surprising to me because I don't even enjoy waffles. But basically, in my dream, I had gotten up for breakfast and wanted to make something to eat. I can't remember much of what happened in between, but next thing I know is that I prepared pancake batter, but after cooking them, I got surprised to see that the outcome were waffles, with the perfect shape and everything.

Even in my dream I was surprised that waffles had come out. When I got up, I was in the mood for something sweet to go with my coffee, so I got donuts and a Berliner. Two hours later it came to me that I had had this dream.

1jlak1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jlak1h/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"My husband and I have been married 2 years, together 10. I’ve always known he was blunt, sharp, and to the point…some would say rude. When he is irritated it’s worse. He has never put his hands on me however he’s starting to tread the line… when he gets in these “moods” he can be real nice-nasty. He comes from a family that regularly curses and yells at each other then goes to back to normal the next minute. I was raised in a different household. Only my dad yelled and cursed; we knew this meant to stay out of his way. I definitely have trauma from having to walk on eggshells. Therefore, hearing any type of language as such triggers me. 

So, I accidentally left an empty box of crackers in the cabinet. I did eat the last of the crackers however I distinctly remember asking him to bring me a sleeve of crackers a few nights ago. Therefore I didn’t physically take the last sleeve myself, I asked him to get it for me so I didn’t know the box was empty (hopefully that makes sense…basically I never saw the box empty myself). This morning he went to grab some and realized the box was empty and threw it at me. I felt this was excessive but I didn’t say anything. 

The other day we were in the drive thru coffee line and he realized his order was wrong. I told him he should take it back because you should get what you paid for. He responds “put the fucking car in drive and let’s go”. I almost cried.

These may seem like little things but I’m terrified that he’s going to turn into my dad, which whom I was so afraid of when he would get in moods like this. Is this normal, should I be looking for potential signs? He’s not always like this, probably only about 25% of our marriage however I don’t want that percentage to increase later in life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

1jla8v0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jla8v0,Printing My Full-Color Art Book Overseas: Tips on Color Management and File Setup,"I’m gearing up to print my self-published hardcover art book for an upcoming Kickstarter:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wendichen/love-tide-the-art-of-wendi-chen-art-book

For anyone here who wants to make a full-color art book (or a children’s book), I wanted to save you all a lot of headache with the knowledge I’ve learned:

1) Figure out your book size as soon as possible (mine is 8.5” x 8.5”) and ask for page spread / cover templates. I learned that the standard bleed is .125” on hardcover books, so I included it on all my full-bleed pages.

2) Always make sure the resolution on your art files is 300 DPI or higher. I tend to build my files at 450-600 DPI.

3) Create your art file in an RGB color space with a wide gamut, such as Adobe RGB (1998). This will give you more colors, and thus more leeway when you convert to CMYK at the end.

4) Learn to use professional book layout software like Adobe InDesign (I learned it in two days so it’s not too hard), or pay a professional to do it for you. Canva is not going to cut it for a large format, photo-quality coffee table book.

5) Many printers will darken your colors slightly. You may need to adjust for this at the pre-press stage, so the best thing to do is to pay extra for a hardcopy proof. If you’re a stickler for color accuracy like me, then it’s worth it!

6) Always convert to CMYK color mode when you export your book as a Print PDF.

7) When working with an overseas printer (my printer is based in Guangzhou, China), be as clear as possible and label/name your files very cleanly. Make sure to account for long shipping times and don’t try to rush the production process.

That’s all I’ve got so far! :) Good luck and happy self-publishing!

1jla8oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jla8oq/my_husbands_boss_claims_hes_cheating_on_me_should/,My husband's boss claims he's cheating on me... should I believe her?,"First of all,... why do people love making drama?! I'm VERY sick of dealing with all of this. Secondly, thank you for the safe space, I love our QueenPotato's community and how you're always keen on helping each other.

Right... the story. Sorry if it's long, I'm probably venting.

Context: my husband and I went through a bit of a rough patch finantially speaking a while ago. Luckily, he's got a good job now, and we're very happy... BUT.

He got a job thanks to an old coworker (female coworker, may I add), and he was very grateful. She's his direct boss now, and that's why I'm in a bit of a pickle. He has been in this new job for a few months, and everything seemed good. The job is mostly remote, but he has to occasionally travel to another city to meet with clients or his boss, let's call her Rebecca (I love that name, it makes for a great villain or protagonist, you decide).

Rebecca calls him regularly. Nothing weird there, she's his boss. Sometimes, he'll put her on speaker if he's doing something like making coffee, cooking, or cleaning, so I've heard their interactions, and they're pretty normal. She doesn't call him after hours, and my husband is the sort of guy who goes to sleep around 8-ish. I'm the one who stays up later than he, which is why this has me VERY confused.

Yesterday, my husband had to travel yet again for work. He arrived at the city early, called me after his meetings, I went about my day, and we talked again in the evening when he was back at home. Mind you, he stays with his sister and husband, so he's pretty much ""accounted for"" at all times. I don't think Rebecca knew that he was staying with relatives, by the way.

Today, my husband called me as soon as he got up. We talked for a bit, and he told me he was going to pick up some things from the office and head home. A while ago, he sent me his location when he hit the road, and that's where he's at right now (around three hours of travel).

Rebecca contacted me almost as soon as my husband hit the road, which I'm beginning to think was her plan all along. She sent a long text telling me that my husband had been ""making advances at her"" and that she was very sorry to inform me that he had been unfaithful to me with her. That she felt awful knowing that we were parents and that it was her guilt which urged her to reach out to me and ""tell me the truth"". I was, as one would expect, speechless and confused by her message. I firstly thanked her for her message (you know, trying to be supportive of who I thought was a brave woman speaking up) and I asked her when everything had happened, and if she had any proof... and this is where things got kind of messy.

She sent me screenshots of a conversation that dated a few weeks prior, and the picture on the screenshots was the same that my husband has, but... the way he wrote was strange... My husband is VERY careful about his punctuation (almost to a fault), and these texts were plagued with mistakes. He also supposedly sent a LOT of emojis of hearts, the eggplant, the peach, and fire... and I mean, not that it's of anyone's business, but he doesn't do that. He HATES writing with emojis or sending stickers. He has told me that words are enough to communicate and that emojis are lazy, or a way to ""soften up the blow"" (his words, not mine, I personally don't mind emojis). I mean, he could be using emojis with a lover, how would I know? But that struck me as odd...  
  
Finally, she told me that they had gone to his ""hotel"" the previous night at his insistence. I KNOW for a fact that CAN'T be true because he called me from his sister's home yesterday, and even put me on speaker so I could say hi to SIL and BIL... But Rebecca even put the name of the hotel in her text; she was being very specific, as if trying to prove that she had receipts...

I asked her what time they were at his ""hotel"", and she blew up at me. Telling me that I was victim-shaming her, questioning her when she was just being honest, and that she didn't have to tell me at all, but that she was doing it out of sorority, and that she had sent me proof about his infidelity, and so on. Since she is his boss, I didn't push it further. I simply thanked her and didn't ask anything else.

Here's the thing: I don't think he cheated on me. I think Rebecca is making this whole thing up. Why? My best guess is that she's got a crush on him or something. But I'm wondering if I'm being naive. I want to speak to my husband (obviously), but how do I approach this? My biggest fear, to be honest, is for him to lose his job over this. Again, I'm having a hard time believing he would cheat on me. Am I being too naive?",6,1743098440.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

Here is the context: 

High level contact athlete (karate) for several years 
Delivery driver for 8 years 
I received emergency HIV treatment for 28 days 
I have always practiced bodybuilding intensively 
Vitamin D deficiency 
I might as well tell you that I tick all the boxes of potential causes that can be attributed to ALS according to the different studies.

Here is my story:

1/ Contractures and tics started in my left elbow 12 months ago. approximately. In a very intense way without stopping I tell myself it’s definitely the blood circulation.
Then it doesn’t stop, I search on Google and there, a wonderful surprise, “fasciculations sla”! 
I convince myself that no, it is certainly due to my excessive joint cracking of both elbows on a daily basis, surely due to my chronic musculoskeletal tensions from bodybuilding. 
Even so, descent into hell I become hyper vigilant to my whole body and I begin to make connections from the past. 
Throat which cracked with enormous intensity in 2023 followed by a hoarse voice for a week, a lymph node had appeared just before in my neck. 
Cramps in left hand and weakness in right shoulder blade when weight training for a week unable to lift anything, I remembered foot cramps and currently I also have foot cramps or rather mini or pre cramps. 
You should know that I have a hollow left hand at the lumbrical interosseous bones, you can see my tendons. The right hand for comparison is the same anatomy but less hollow. 

2/2 months later fasciculations in my right elbow this time then in a generalized manner (the feet the ankles the calves the thighs the buttocks the hands the shoulders the thorax the back the neck the throat the masseters all my muscles without exception) followed by electrical discharges which go from my armpits to the elbows, wrists and hands especially the left side. 
Particularly when I place my elbows on a table, when I bend my wrist, during movements or when I touch my nerves, it sends me electric shocks. 
4th finger of my left hand which goes numb from time to time (this is a finger that I cracked a lot for several years daily to the point of pain sometimes) 
I do a first EMG electrode in October 2024 on my arms and needles on the right leg only and nothing abnormal, I feel good. Everything is rolling.

I consult chatgpt and the forums the EMG needle is mandatory to detect ALS 

I dive back into my worries. The emg for the month of October was of no use.

I observe my body I realize my atrophied tongue and the instability in my hands I feel activity it is teeming when I stretch my fingers and hold the position it is unpleasant and a little difficult. My wrist in the rotation decreases in speed towards the end of the rotation, I shake when I hold and swirl my coffee cup. 
I take motor skills tests and I seem to pass and fail some.
My hand is hollow, you can see my tendons. My fingers are a little deformed on my bony hands 

I urgently go to a medical center in a panic. The doctor said nothing abnormal about my reflexes, my strength and my atrophied tongue but noted perhaps a “candida” fungus but she did not check my fine motor skills 
I consult ChatGPT : the candida fungus can be caused by different pathologies etc. and neurological diseases in particular ""ALS"" and come on I dive again and further into reading reddit, science articles 

Then the icing on the cake for a week I have had the feeling of being strangled at times with my throat cracking. My tongue on the front edges is diminished as if atrophied and it's real. I can't swallow my saliva or liquid on the first gulp without making a noise, and like a blocking mechanism my voice is hoarse. 

In my head I have an atypical form of ALS which has been progressing very slowly in the upper and bulbar limbs for 4 or 5 years that no one sees. 

I have been depressed for 1 month. I stopped working 2 weeks ago. 
Today 5 months later 2nd emg but with the needles in my left triceps my left hand hypothenar thenar and interosseous left shoulder thorax intercostal and in my tongue

Nothing unusual. I emerge relieved, I am reborn from my ashes, I still have my symptoms (precramp in my left hand, intense fasciculations throughout my body, difficulty swallowing) but above all I hope not to go through this ordeal again

Here's the systen that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

Should I go for a third date and then decide or call it off already?,"So the first date with this guy I met on hinge was really cute. He picked me up, we had dinner and talked a lot and he paid for the dinner and I asked him if we should split and he got really sad so I let him pay for the date and he said I can do it on the second date. I was like sure, we had ice cream and were together from 8pm to   12 am. 
He dropped me home, we hugged.


On the second date, which was supposed to happen on Saturday but since we were both rager to meet each other, we met last night after my internship ended. We had momos and coffee and we talked but I felt a little bored this time. One thing that threw me off was a bit of childish behaviour and when I was paying for the momos, he was amazed. I was like okay, he might just be shocked, for some reason. When we went for coffee and I was paying again, he said "" oh wow what's happening to you today, paying for food and all huh"" loudly 

This embarassed me because it's not like I'm a freeloader. 
He tries to make me stay longer which I find really cute but I'm scared that due to the childish behaviour he actually doesn't understand women's safety concerns of getting home in time. He also feels like he's bragging about his body and work and sometimes making fun of how I haven't been to many places but in a subtle way. I am not sure if I'm getting too paranoid or if I should go with my gut instincts and just call it off or wait for a third date to happen

Levain: 35g King Arthur Bread Flour, 35g King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour, 35g Starter, 70g Water

Same levain for both loaves (halved for blueberry lemon since I only baked 1 loaf and my levain is designed to make 2)

Dark Chocolate Espresso loaf:
Dough: 810g Bread Flour, 90g Whole Wheat Flour, 500g coffee (from Moka) 80g water added with salt, 18g salt (makes 2 loaves)

Blueberry Lemon:
Dough: 405g Bread Flour, 45g Whole Wheat Flour, 25g sugar, 25g lemon juice, 1 lemon zested, 310g water, 9g salt, 170g blueberries

Bulk fermented for 8 hours as we keep our house relatively cold (65-67 Fahrenheit / ~19 Celsius)

Essentially, the route I’ve taken to trying new inclusions is to modify my existing recipe to accommodate the added ingredients. The blueberry lemon was a favorite! With the dark chocolate espresso being good too, albeit a bit rich in flavor. May dial back the coffee a tad, but I do prefer the Moka pot coffee as to instant coffee like I see recommended typically when doing these types of loaves.

laugh (I’m very bubbly, he’s witty), but as the date went on, it dawned in me:  
he *really* seems to like me, and I just felt this crushing feeling, like “*Oh no, he’s falling in love with me!*”.

He didn’t *do* anything over the top – didn’t tell me he really liked me, speak about future plans, try to pressure me or get physical – and he communicated normally with me before  
and after the date, but I *felt* like he really likes me – like, too much. He was beaming. Smiling, having a good time, just visibly excited and happy.

And I feel really uncomfortable. I guess because I know he is looking for an LTR and marriage I almost feel like he is lining me up and looking at me like I’m wife material.

The cause of the problem:
There's a small rubber sealing washer in the robot's filler neck, which is pressed shut by a spring. However, due to limescale and constant refilling, it eventually no longer closes completely and begins to drip....

The solution: After many experiments with our old S7 MaxV Ultra, which developed the same problem, I used silicone grease (for fully automatic coffee machines) to lubricate both the seal in the dock and the seal in the filler neck.

I try to make some signs in conversations etc. But I don’t know how to get it if she likes me too. I am pretty scared to ask her upfront because I don’t want to lose a friend and I just don’t know how to behave. 

Also from my perspective she did some positive signs to me as well as jokingly saying I should be with other girl (its an inside joke in our friend group)

One more fact, I asked her out for a coffee a couple of days ago, she said she will tell me today if she will be able to do it, because she has pretty tense schedule, but she didn’t tell anything",1,1743097449.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Dating trends this spring are all about:  
🔥 **Spontaneous & low-pressure meetups** (Coffee dates, walks, or even catching a baseball game instead of high-stakes dinners!)  
🌿 **Active & experience-based dates** (Farmers’ markets, hikes, food truck festivals—who else is over stiff dinner convos?)  
💌 **Romance making a comeback** (Handwritten notes, flirty texts, thoughtful gestures—why did we stop doing this?)  
🚫 **No more ‘situationships’** (We’re setting boundaries, prioritizing emotional well-being, and dating with intention!)  
🌎 **Expanding the dating pool** (Challenging old ""types"" and being open to unexpected connections!)

# I’d love to share my journey into game development — maybe it inspires someone who’s just starting out.

# 🛠️ How It Started

* 📅 February 3rd — I installed Unity for the first time.
* 🤕 February 4th — I broke my right shoulder (and I’m right-handed!). Ended up in the hospital.
* 🏥 February 12th — I was discharged and back home, learning to use my left hand for everything.

Despite the situation, I didn’t give up — I started a free Unity 3D course.

# 💡 The Spark

In one of the lessons, there was a simple assignment: drop balls into a basket.  
It suddenly gave me an idea — what if the basket was a trash can?  
That’s when I imagined Trash Busters, and decided to make it my first real project.

# 🚧 Building the Game

* 🧠 I started development on February 23rd.
* 📚 I took a couple more online courses and watched a lot of YouTube tutorials.
* 🤖 I used AI tools heavily, especially for scripting and debugging.

Soon I realized that:

* The more complex the system, the worse AI performs at generating code.
* Some course examples were… actually harmful (yes, I’m looking at you, Update() spam 😩)

But oddly, those broken AI scripts helped me the most —  
By fixing them, breaking them again, rewriting, and combining suggestions,  
I learned way more than from any tutorial.

# 🎮 What I Built

Trash Busters is a lighthearted idle clicker about cleaning up the planet:

* 🧹 Tap or automate trash collection
* ♻️ Recycle it into gold
* 🚀 Upgrade collectors and recyclers
* 🔁 Prestige system with permanent income boosts
* 🗺 Unlock new zones, discover global trash hotspots
* 💡 10+ collector tiers, auto-systems, offline income
* 💣 Future feature: fight “Trash Invaders” with anti-trash armies!

All the art is a mix of free Unity assets and AI-generated illustrations.

# ❤️ Final Thoughts

This was my first game.  
One month of learning. One month of building.  
One broken arm, lots of trial & error, and tons of coffee.

If you’re learning game dev, keep going.  
You’ll be amazed how fast things click when you're making your own game.

Thanks for reading 🙏 Feel free to ask anything!

1jl9ssq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1jl9ssq/i_have_ptsd_from_gr_years_ago_now_they_are_back/,I have PTSD from GR years ago. Now they are back in my home and I feel crushed.,"When I was 17, aging out of foster care. I lived with my then pedophile boyfriend. The house, which was a duplex, never had bug problems for the first 2 years. A little before I turned 17, the upstairs tenants moved out, and the nightmare began. They lived in anything they could fit in. Under the keys of my keyboard, in my laptop via the vents, the crevices of furniture, I was never ever safe from them. I did not go a day without multiple crawling on me. they didn't fear the lights being on. Id pick up my cup of fresh coffee and one would crawl into me. I didn't have a food waste issue either. I'm fine now but at the time I ate rarely and irregularly. I genuinely can't remember how we got rid of them, I think we did. I blocked out so much from around the it was genuinely beyond horrifying. I couldn't escape them. I could never kill them enough. They had no problem crawling on me. They didn't even try to scatter, just inch away and crawl back.

Now the nightmare is happening again. I sometimes hang out in my fiances office at his work. I noticed in their break room a GR. Shook it off. Maybe a few months or less later, I notice one in the car. I made myself extremely clear that seeing one means it's already started, and there's more in every place you can't see. Maybe another few months and his car is infested. We take his car to get food to go. It's a 2 seater so I'm holding the bag of dinner. A few dozen start coming from the seems in the console, the panels around the radio, the AC. I am embarrassed now but I started screaming and crying because they were crawling on me for the bag. I just felt like a crazy person on high alert, every single one of them are so insanely responsive to anything edible. We made it home. I made him dust himself off and check eachothers back and hair. Especially mine because it is a mountain of curls, I've lost hair ties in it. I stressed so much how awful they are, and how hard it is to even explain the aggression of the infestation once it begins.

Two weeks ago I saw one on the backsplash of the kitchen sink. All I could do is cry. 
A few more here and there. I ask my fiance to do the killing if he's near, I'm so absolutely scorn and miserable to even feel them pop and crush beneath a napkin. There is no such thing as revenge with these insects. 
Last night there was one in the wall just in front of my desk, right there, a large one for a GC. I ask him to please get rid of it, he does ofc. 
This morning I woke up earlier than usual without an alarm because my stomach said wake up I'm hungry, so I go to my kitchen with just my phone flashlight on.
Easily ten just there on my counter next to the sink, which is empty. I killed what I could and sobbed, more came out the the woodworks. Atleast when they're on the counter if you do use them with water they kind of stop moving- it's easier than trying to do precision kills.
I just broke down in my kitchen. This is the first time in my life I've had a home, and felt safe. What if they get to the entire house? Its hard to put in to words the level of fear and anxiety these things cause. Oddly enough I actually like bugs, grew up on a tropical island with massive venomous centipedes and flying cockroaches the size of a mechanics thumb- the worst I can say about them is I just don't like them when they're inside my house.
GR for me, are a living nightmare, and on top of being horrific, debilitating, and capable of taking your ability to feel okay in your home, they give me the kind of depression and anxiety where I revert back to self punishment and irrationality.
My apologies for the rant. I do not socialize in person, or much online so this is the only place where I can at the very least talk about this very very crushing issue. My heart hurts for anyone who's ever had to encounter this literal hell.",3,1743097322.0,GermanRoaches,1,1.0,False

Normally I have a ‘don’t shit where you eat’ rule, but have been seeing a coworker for about a year now. Started as a drunk get together when he first joined, then a sort of FWB, we’ve been navigating having some feelings for each other, but I’ve not wanted to cross it into official relationship territory. For my part, I was in an abusive relationship in my late teens/early 20s, then met a wonderful man who I married, who then had the audacity to die, so I’ve been clear my headspace is ‘I’m enjoying myself and grateful for it, but to be honest I can’t be fucked anymore’. He’s been very respectful of where I’m at and while he’s said he’d like it to be more, we’ve agreed to leave it at where we are, unless we otherwise open up the conversation again.

With me, he’s been fun, sweet and, distractingly, an incredible lay. There are a couple of surface level flags that I didn’t want to be too judgemental with but have definitely kept me cautious (he’s never been in a serious relationship/lived with anyone before, he mentioned he fell out with his longest friend who he had known for all of 8 years…). I sounded sus as fuck to my husband when we first met because I had basically cut everyone out of my life from the last relationship and I know this guy has a few traumas of his own, so I have largely left it to judging his conduct as I’ve seen it. Up til now, I thought it had been absolutely fine.

Cue to last Friday. I went out with a few other colleagues, I did say he could come too, but he said it might look suspicious/obvious we’re seeing each other if I invited him especially. I told him I had already invited my close friend who I’ll call Bestie. Later that night, I drunk texted basically to float the idea of a booty call, but was then too drunk to actually turn up. He texted the next morning to say he was annoyed about staying up to wait for me as a no show, which I think is fair. What then became clear is he blamed who I was out drinking with, specifically Bestie. Started ranting about how he’s some sneaky little weasel because when leaving work and other people on their team asked about going out for a drink, Bestie said he couldn’t and was probably going to just head home. Bestie didn’t know FWB had been invited out and didn’t want to float an invite to anyone else when it wasn’t ‘his’ outing, and he did text me to say he was going to come seconds before he arrived, because the bar we were at was on his way home. Regardless of whether Bestie always meant to see me or not, I don’t see how it was anything more than a white lie out of social convention. FWB is not having it, to the point where he confronted Bestie about being a liar in the office and Bestie came to me really anxious and stressed about how this would affect his work.

I take Bestie out for a coffee and suddenly all this stuff pours out about how he’s sorry if he’s been distant with me for the last few months, but that FWB gets really aggressive whenever I come up to the point that Bestie has been avoiding me. I thought we hadn’t spoken in a while just because it’s busy and that our schedules hadn’t been lining up, so this blindsided me. Apparently everyone on FWB’s team finds him really difficult to work with, hypocritical and hyperbolic. FWB had told me that he’s in therapy for being a pushover, but it sounds like he’s getting into fights with everyone all the time.

Me and Bestie have been good friends for probably a decade or more at this point. I helped him propose to his wife, he was one of the only people from work to talk to me when I was on compassionate leave and I know I trust him completely on this.

So… how do I distance myself from FWB? I’m scared of making it about Bestie and making the whole situation worse for him. Is there a way to explain his behaviour has been a turn off if I haven’t seen it directly?

TL;DR: FWB is not the person I thought they were, treatment of a friend and other coworkers is giving me the ick. How can I end it without my friend being blamed",1,1743097188.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

**Essays/LORs/Other:** 

Common app: Pretty strong. reflected on a transformative experience with a sculpture that symbolizes growth, creativity, and unexpected potential—qualities I see in myself. (Opened with a scene depicting my younger self admiring the statue, crafted by a North Korean artist, themes of underrepresentation and empowerment, yada yada). My journey from appreciating art to cultivating an urban garden (microgreen business) taught me resilience, problem-solving, and a deep interest in plant biotechnology. While I may not yet know exactly how I will make an impact, I am driven by my passion for scientific discovery and global change. Basically, like the intricate sculpture, my path may seem unpredictable, but every experience shapes me into the person I am becoming—an ever-evolving work in progress.

Its tricky to summarize but this definitely is an amazing essay and the themes I want to communicate are strong, this got me into BU for sure.

UMich essay 1: communities -> Strong-ish? I dont have a crazy community story to tell… I'm privileged and white. I have synesthesia, so i talked about that. Excerpt: “While these experiences are meaningful, what I appreciate most about my synesthesia is that because of it I intuitively understand the nuanced ways that people can perceive and process information, which has given me a deep appreciation for diverse opinions and viewpoints”. Talked about connections and deeply personal experiences with others. 

Essay 2 “what college or school” -> Nailed it. (IMO) Really super-duper emphasized INTERDISCIPLINARY studies and spoke to the LSA specifically, my alignment with UMich’s LSA program. Reflected on how my experiences with orthodontic treatment and my passion for urban gardening have shaped my interest in dentistry. Through studying plant science and biochemistry, I have explored the intricate systems that sustain life, from aquaponics to cellular resilience in plants. Spoke on how I am eager to merge these interests by pursuing pre-dental coursework, engaging in lab research on bioactive molecules in plants, and addressing oral health disparities through ecological solutions. Mentioned that with mentorship from the Health Sciences Scholars Program and collaboration with initiatives like Planet Blue, I hope to redefine healthcare by bridging biochemistry, environmental sustainability, and dentistry to improve patient outcomes.

Last Sunday he texted me to play pickle ball, and we agreed for the weekend. He texts me today that all the courts are booked and we could go for coffee and a walk instead, so I understood that he is not just interested in me to play pickle ball, but to actually just see each other regardless of what we do. I said, yes a coffee and walk is great!

Immediately after he says you can also come to my place after work for some fun. (we did this on the first date). Is this concerning? I feel like he won't do the coffee and walk Sunday if I see him tomorrow. But it has only been 2 weeks, so I can't just assume the worst right away (I am known to cut off people for little things, someone told me I do not put effort into love at all.) Am I overanalyzing all this or does he just want to spend more time together?

I feel like my future husband wouldn't play texting games, but maybe it wasn't a game and that is just normal for him and it is not normal for me to analyze such things.

Currently haven't responded to his last text about meeting tomorrow for the ""fun"".

Appreciate any insight. Looking for advice, reassurance, etc.

He is a friend of my cousin’s and I was told that he is looking to “settle down” and meet someone nice. I wasn’t sure how I felt about that…for various reasons (just moved into the city, just started a new job, don’t know if I am ready for that, etc.), but I eventually agreed to meet him for coffee.

He was…great. He's good looking, smart, has a great job – definitely has his stuff together – and we got along really well. I actually did like him and we both made each other  
laugh (I’m very bubbly, he’s witty), but as the date went on, it dawned in me:  
he *really* seems to like me, and I just felt this crushing feeling, like “*Oh no, he’s falling in love with me!*”.

He didn’t *do* anything over the top – didn’t tell me he really liked me, speak about future plans, try to pressure me or get physical – and he communicated normally with me before  
and after the date, but I *felt* like he really likes me – like, too much. He was  
beaming. Smiling, having a good time, just visibly excited and happy.

And I feel really uncomfortable. I guess because I know he is looking for an LTR and marriage I almost feel like he is lining me up and looking at me like I’m wife material.  
It sounds stupid, but I never asked myself how I would feel if the date went “well”.

I wasn’t anticipating this though, and I’m trying to understand why I feel the way I do. I just feel like he’s made up his mind already and it doesn’t sit right with me. Like, if I  
see him again, he’ll think that *I* must feel the same way, and all I can imagine is  
this guy, over the moon, feeling like he’s with “the one”. It's making me shudder.  

Is it normal to feel less attracted to someone that you know *really* likes you?

1jl9mwj,https://i.redd.it/kngcyuk1q9re1.jpeg,"My review of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"", directed by David Fincher","I had been wanting to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for a very long time ; first because I love Fincher (Se7en is one of my favorite movies), second because I already read (or rather devoured) the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson (TGWTDT is, let’s not forget, an adaptation of the novel of the same name). 

Well… 

I’m disappointed.

Imagine over 1,000 pages of investigation, introspection, analysis, and scheming. Now imagine a film adaptation of those 1,000 pages that barely lasts two hours. See where I’m going with this? 

This movie feels like a summary. Steven Zaillian (the screenwriter) bulldozed through the original plot. Everything is shortened, to the point where it gets a bit confusing (if I hadn’t read the book, I think I would have struggled to understand what was going on).

For example, take the scene where Henrik Vanger meets Mikael for the first time and explains all the ins and outs of the Harriet Vanger mystery. In the book, this scene spans dozens of pages. In the movie, it lasts no more than five minutes.

I was also a bit disappointed by Lisbeth, even though Rooney Mara’s performance is remarkable. In the novel, she is arguably the most complex and unique female character I’ve ever encountered. In the film, she’s nothing but a reserved goth who knows how to hack computers. This is probably because the book places a huge emphasis on her thoughts, which is hard to replicate in a two-hour movie.

I’d also like to point out two performances that I found off the mark. First, Stellan Skarsgård (who plays Martin Vanger). You can tell he’s a psychopath from his very first appearance in the film (and no, this has nothing to do with me having read the book). His coldness, his gaze… you raise an eyebrow at him right away. In the book, Martin is infinitely more warm and charming. At no point do you suspect him of even killing a fly—until Mikael unmasks him, and then he reveals his true nature.

Second, Daniel Craig (who plays Mikael Blomkvist). I found him too cold, too robotic (too James Bond). The Mikael in the book is far more human—passionate about his work (or should I say obsessed), about women, about simple things like a cup of coffee… None of that is well represented in the film.

And Millennium?! One of the best aspects of the book is the slow rise of this small newspaper, held together by a handful of passionate people. In the film, this aspect is completely botched. Barely a few minutes are dedicated to it, and I would have preferred if they hadn’t bothered at all. The staff is large (which is odd, considering the paper is supposed to be on the verge of collapse), dull, cold (they celebrate their revenge on Wennerström with crossed arms and austere expressions)… In one word : depressing.

All that said, the film does have its strengths, particularly Cronenweth’s cinematography and Reznor’s score, which effectively highlight Hedestad’s cold and eerie atmosphere.

Is it a bad movie? No. Is it a masterpiece? Definitely not, especially after reading the excellent novel by the late Stieg Larsson.

## Key Considerations Before ​You Start

Before you rush out and purchase the first ‍garden shed you see,it's crucial to carefully consider ⁤several vital⁢ factors:

It's imperative to thoroughly research and understand the specific requirements in your⁤ area ⁢before embarking on your project. ⁤You'll need to‌ determine whether your ⁤shed requires⁤ a building permit, ⁢and whether it's permissible to use it as a dwelling. Things like ⁢minimum ​ceiling height, insulation requirements, fire safety standards, and plumbing regulations can all come into play. Neglecting these legalities can result in hefty fines, forced demolition, ⁣or an inability to legally rent out the space. Be sure to meticulously check‍ all standards for creating a legal garden shed with bathroom.

*   **Size ‌and layout:** ‍The size of your garden shed will dictate it's potential uses and‌ the level of comfort⁣ you can achieve. consider your specific needs and lifestyle when determining the appropriate size. A small garden shed tiny ‍house might⁤ be‌ perfect for a minimalist single dweller, while a larger structure can accommodate a ⁣couple or even a small family.The layout should be carefully ⁤planned to maximize‌ space utilization ⁣and create‌ a functional and‍ comfortable living environment.

*   **Insulation and Climate Control:** Proper insulation is essential for creating a habitable garden shed that remains comfortable year-round. Adequate insulation will‍ help regulate temperature, reduce energy consumption, and prevent moisture⁢ build-up. Consider using high-quality insulation materials in the ​walls, roof, and floor. Depending on ⁢your climate, you may also need to invest in a heating and cooling system.An insulated garden shed for living is ⁢vital.

*   **Plumbing and Electrical Systems:** If you plan to include a bathroom or kitchen in your garden shed, you'll need to install plumbing and electrical systems. This may require hiring licensed professionals to ensure⁣ compliance with building ‌codes and safety standards. Consider the complexities of connecting to existing water and sewer ‍lines or installing choice systems like septic tanks and ⁢composting toilets. Similarly, electrical‌ wiring should be done by a qualified ‍electrician to prevent fire hazards and​ ensure adequate power supply.

* ‍  **Ventilation and Moisture Control:** Proper ventilation is crucial for preventing moisture build-up and‌ maintaining air quality within your garden shed. Consider installing windows that ​can be opened​ for natural ventilation, as well as a mechanical ⁤ventilation system to remove excess moisture and odors. Moisture ⁣barriers should also be installed to ‍protect​ the structure from water ⁤damage.

*   **Foundation:** The ​foundation is ‍the bedrock for your garden shed. A‌ solid ‌foundation‍ is key to preventing ‌structural problems like settling, cracking or moisture.⁢ Common foundation options⁢ include concrete slabs, piers, or gravel pads. This is also linked to legal requirements. Creating a legal habitable garden sheds requires this⁢ careful attention to detail.

1jl9gra,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jl9gra/should_i_see_my_ex_one_more_time/,Should I see my ex one more time?,"She broke up with me 4 weeks ago which sucked but it was an amicable ending, I understood where she was coming from and wasn't blindsided. I wanted to keep trying but she didn't. We've been  no contact since then minus a few logistical texts since we lived together (thankfully she was able to move out immediately).

Anyway, I moved to a new country to be with her and I'm leaving in a month. When we broke up we agreed to get coffee before I leave which she mentioned in her last text. I thought I wanted more of an explanation from her but after reflecting I don't think I need that. It's good that once I move home it will be over over and it should be easier to move on. I'm doing well given the circumstances but still miss her and im pretty upset about losing her knowing there's a lot I could've done better.

I know I wont get closure from her, but I think it would be nice to get some feedback and just leave things on a good note with a friendly coffee and see where she's at since I still really care about her. But I'm worried seeing her is just gonna bring back a lot of emotions and set me back.

Should I break no contact for this or should I just cancel and never see or talk to her again?",1,1743096484.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for a small generator on gasoline under €/$ 1000. It would be used to power the most important stuff in the house in case of an outage (fridges, freezer, some lights, coffee machine, laptop,... ) . I'm thinking 3kw would be sufficient. (EU country 230v)
While I have it I might use it for a camping trip also, so silent would be nice. 

What brand should I look into and which ones I should avoid? 

I believe I should go for an inverter generator. 

I'm looking at the maXpeedingrods 3300 W. Any good?

                Chapter One: The Attic

      The attic was colder than a tax collector’s handshake — so cold Elena Carter figured her breath might qualify for frostbite. Dust hung in the air like it paid rent. A single, flickering lightbulb dangled from the ceiling, twitching like it had anxiety issues.

     “This place is straight-up cursed,” muttered Cassie Reynolds, swiping a cobweb off her sleeve with the flair of someone battling for her life in a spider-based horror movie. “Your grandma hoarded like she was auditioning for Buried Alive: Haunted Edition.”

     Elena smirked. “She called it ‘collecting.’”

     “Yeah? Well, It looks like she was panic collecting for an apocalypse.’” Cassie kicked a stack of newspapers. “If something skitters out of here with more than four legs, know that I'm getting the fuck out of here, consider me “Raptured”!!!

     “Noted,” Elena said dryly.

     Her eyes drifted over the room — old boxes, broken furniture, and enough dust to start a new ecosystem on one of the moons of Jupiter, and that's when Elena saw it….

     A glint of burgundy beneath a pile of moth-eaten blankets.

     Cassie saw her staring. “Oh no,” she warned, wagging a finger. “Don’t. That’s your ‘I just found a cursed artifact’ face. ”Im not gonna be the dumbass broad that's killed first in this movie….Whatever it is, it's already got the pick up your bible and start praying vibe coming from it”

     Ignoring her, Elena knelt and brushed the blankets aside. Underneath lay a large leather-bound diary. Its surface gleamed like it had just been moisturized — which was objectively concerning.

     Cassie recoiled like she owed the book money, saying “Does it know it's sunbathing in the dark?’”

     “No idea,” Elena said, touching the warm leather. “But I think it’s—”

     “Evil,” Cassie cut in. “It’s evil. Put it back. Put it back.”

     The words on the cover were faint but unmistakable: Memento Mori.

     Cassie squinted. “What’s that mean? ‘More fucked moments?” 

     No, It's Latin for “‘Remember you must die,’” Elena murmured.

     Cassie pointed dramatically. “See? That’s not a book; that’s a death threat in hardcover.”

     “It’s just a diary.”

     “Right, and I’m sure if you turn the page it politely suggests a sensible savings account.”

     Ignoring her, Elena opened the book. The pages were blank. Pristine.

     Cassie peered over her shoulder. “So your grandma kept an empty book titled ‘Hey, You're Gonna Die’? Totally normal.”

     “There’s something here...” Elena tilted the book and caught the faint watermark: an intricate crest, barely visible unless the light hit just right.

     Cassie scowled. “That’s not a diary. That’s a trap.”

     “Relax.”

     “Relax?” Cassie snorted. “I’m two seconds away from smudging you with sage and dousing that thing in holy water.”

     “It’s just a book.”

     “Yeah? And a Ouija board’s just a haunted addiction game of Scrabble”
      Chapter Two: Cursed Ink


     Later that night, Elena sat at her grandmother’s creaky old desk, staring at Memento Mori. Cassie sprawled on the couch, scrolling through her phone fast enough to catch it on fire, looked up for a moment and being the ultimate smartass said,

     “So,” “are you waiting for the diary to start narrating your life like it’s the opening credits of a horror movie?”

     “I’m just... thinking.”

     “Oh good,” Cassie said. “Thinking. That’s never gone wrong for you before.”

     “I was considering writing something in it.”

     Cassie’s phone hit the couch. “I’m sorry, you were what now?”

     “Just... a test.”

     “Yeah, that’s how they describe it on the Unsolved Mysteries episode — right before the neighbors start finding body parts in the garden.”

     “I’m serious.” Elena grabbed a pen.

     “Oh great, let’s poke the evil and see what happens,” Cassie muttered. “I’ll grab a fire extinguisher.”

     Elena ignored her and scrawled a few words:

     Found this diary in the attic. Feels weird. Cassie’s being dramatic, but I can’t shake the feeling this thing... matters.

“Riveting,” Cassie said. “Really laying the groundwork for your Pulitzer.”

Then the ink moved.

Elena froze. “Uh... Cassie?”

Cassie glanced up — and screamed loud enough to scare a burglar two houses away. “NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.”

The words on the page rearranged themselves:

""Thank you for opening me.""

Cassie bolted off the couch. “What part of ‘NOPE’ aren’t you hearing right now?”

“It’s... writing itself.” Elena’s voice wobbled.

Cassie flapped her hands like she was trying to shoo away the devil. “Nope! Nope! This is exactly how you end up eating spiders in a basement while something whispers Latin at you!”

More words appeared:

""I'm here for a reason, and you can help me become free... I grant desires, but only three.""

Cassie’s jaw dropped. “Okay, nope times infinity. That’s literally the plot of every horror movie I’ve ever screamed at.”

“Relax,” Elena said, even though she absolutely was not relaxed. “I’m not making a wish.”

“Great,” Cassie huffed. “Because if you so much as whisper ‘I wish for a pony,’ I’m driving to Mexico.”

But curiosity gnawed at Elena. Before she could stop herself, she whispered, “I wish to know the truth.”

Cassie’s hands shot to her face. “Oh my God, you DID NOT.
                    ChapterThere : UnholyBargaining 
Someone pounded on the door.

The kind of pounding that said, I’m not here for polite conversation.

“Oh no,” Elena muttered.

“Oh YES,” Cassie shot back. “I told you! Congratulations, The master of dumbass wishes is here”!!!
Elena dragged herself to the door and yanked it open.

The man on the other side wore a tailored suit made of pure menace. His smile belonged to someone who enjoyed tax audits and running over handicapped old ladies in crosswalks.

“Evening,” he said smoothly. “Mind if I come in?”

“Oh absolutely not,” Elena said flatly. “Who are you?”

His grin widened. “You invited me.”

Cassie gagged on her own spit. “You summoned a demon booty call Elena?”

“I wished for the truth, not a booty call dammit!!” Elena barked.

“Oh, but truth’s my specialty,” the stranger said, stepping closer. “You can call me... Unholy.”

Cassie snorted. “That’s not a name, that’s a rejected energy drink flavor.”

Unholy chuckled darkly. “And yet, here I am.”

“Look,” Elena said, rubbing her temples, “if you’re here to tell me I need more fiber or that my horoscope says 'prepare for death,' I’ll pass.”

“Oh no,” Unholy purred. “I’m here because you’ve made a... fascinating trade.”

Elena frowned. “What trade?”

Unholy’s smile stretched wider. “Well... you traded your life as you knew it. But don’t worry.” He winked. “I’ll make it entertaining.”

Cassie grabbed her popcorn bowl again. “Oh, I’m so glad I didn’t leave.”Chapter Two: Bargainin With         Unholy

Elena stood frozen in the doorway, glaring at the smug man in the shadow-woven suit.

""Yeah... no,"" she said, starting to close the door.

Unholy slapped his hand against the wood and grinned. ""Ah, c'mon now. You wished for the truth."" He leaned in. ""And I brought snacks.""

Cassie’s head popped into view. ""Wait, snacks?""

""Don’t encourage him,"" Elena snapped.

Unholy held up a paper bag. “Cheddar popcorn, the good kind.”

Cassie gasped. “The white cheddar or the fake-orange powder stuff?”

“White cheddar,” Unholy purred.

Cassie grabbed Elena’s arm. “Okay, let him in — but only because I’m weak and this is important.”

“You’re seriously negotiating with the devil over popcorn?”

“Hey,” Cassie said, “I’m not proud.”

With a sigh that felt like giving up on life itself, Elena stepped aside.

Unholy strolled in like he owned the place, dropping his shadowy aura across the room like a bad cologne. He tossed the bag of popcorn to Cassie, who caught it like she’d just won the lottery.

“So,” Unholy drawled, loosening his tie like he was about to give a lecture on bad decisions, “let’s talk about your wish.”

“Oh no,” Elena said, crossing her arms. “First, ground rules: No soul-selling, no creepy riddles, and no turning my house into a swirling vortex of doom.”

Unholy smirked. “Wow. Tough crowd.” He flopped onto the couch, spreading himself across it like an exhausted lounge singer. “You’re no fun.”

Cassie plopped down next to him, ripping open the popcorn bag. “You think she’s no fun? This girl alphabetizes her socks.”

“It’s efficient!” Elena shot back.

“You color-code your receipts,” Cassie added, mouth full of popcorn.

“That’s just good financial management!”

“Oh sure,” Unholy cut in, “I can see the headline now: ‘Local Woman Accidentally Summons Demon While Perfecting Her Filing System.’”

Cassie snorted so hard popcorn flew across the room.

“Okay!” Elena barked, dragging over a chair and plopping down. “What exactly did I sign up for here?”

Unholy steepled his fingers like a guy who was way too excited about bad news. “Well, you wished for the truth, and that’s what I deal in. Problem is…” His grin widened. “The truth’s a slippery little beast. Sometimes it’s helpful... sometimes it’s a punch to the face with brass knuckles.”

“Neat,” Elena said. “Can you skip to the part where I regret everything?”

“Oh sure,” Unholy said cheerfully. “See, every wish has a price. Yours? Well…” He gestured vaguely at her living room.

“What? My house?” Elena squinted.

“Oh no,” Unholy said. “Your life. The details you thought you knew? The nice, cozy world where everything makes sense?” He grinned wider. “Gone.”

Elena stared. “I’m sorry… what?”

“You wished for the truth,” Unholy said matter-of-factly. “So now... you get to know everything. Secrets you shouldn’t know. Lies you thought were facts. The real reason your Wi-Fi keeps cutting out? I know that, too.”

Cassie swallowed a mouthful of popcorn. “Wait. Wait, wait, wait. So, like... you’re just gonna info-dump her entire life’s drama like it’s a season finale cliffhanger?”

“More or less,” Unholy said, inspecting his fingernails like he was bored.

“Okay,” Elena muttered, rubbing her temples. “Tell me something — if I wanted to undo the wish... what would it take?”

Unholy grinned like she’d just handed him a winning lottery ticket. “Ahh, now we’re talking! Well, you could back out — but it’ll cost you.”

“Great,” Elena deadpanned. “Lemme guess. My soul?”

“Oh no, no,” Unholy chuckled. “Too cliché. I’m more creative than that.”

“...What’s the price?”

Unholy’s grin widened. “You let me crash here for a bit.”

Cassie spat out her popcorn. “I’m sorry, WHAT?”

“Relax,” Unholy said with mock innocence. “I won’t even redecorate.”

“You’re a demon,” Elena snapped. “Why would I let you sleep on my couch?”

“I’ll do chores,” Unholy said. “I make amazing coffee. Better than those hipster cafes where everyone’s beard smells like pinecones.”

“Still a no,” Elena said.

“I can also tell you people’s darkest secrets,” Unholy added, wagging his eyebrows. “I know exactly who’s been stealing Amazon packages off your porch.”

Cassie gasped. “Wait, was it—”

“Oh yeah,” Unholy cut in. “It’s Todd. Guy two houses down. Total porch pirate. Even wears fingerless gloves for ‘stealth.’”

“I knew it!” Cassie shrieked.

“Still no,” Elena said.

Unholy tapped his chin. “Okay… how about this? Let me stay for three days — just three — and I’ll fix your car.”

“My car doesn’t need fixing,” Elena said flatly.

“Ohhhh,” Unholy chuckled darkly. “It will.”

Elena groaned. “Fine. Three days. But if you even think about pulling some cursed nonsense—”

“I’m an honest demon,” Unholy said, placing a hand over his chest like he’d just been knighted.

“That’s not a thing!” Elena shot back.

“It is when you’re this good at lying.” Unholy smirked.






She just had to survive three days.

Chapter Four: Tyrannosaurus Wrecks

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, giving Elena’s living room a warm, calm glow — which was a complete lie because there was nothing calm about the demon currently parading around her kitchen in a fluffy pink robe.

“Morning, mortals!” Unholy announced like a deranged game show host, strutting into the room with Elena’s robe cinched tightly at the waist like he was starring in a demonic skincare commercial.

Cassie, sprawled on the couch, blinked at him in disbelief. “Oh good. Satan’s here for brunch.”

“You mock,” Unholy said, dramatically adjusting the robe’s sleeves with the precision of a runway model, “but you two are lucky I showed up like this.”

“Oh?” Elena muttered, staggering in with tangled hair and a mug of coffee large enough to double as a weapon. “What’s your better alternative?”

Unholy grinned smugly, the fuzzy pink robe swishing dramatically as he turned. “Well, technically, I used to appear as a T-Rex.”

Cassie froze mid-spoonful of cereal. “I’m sorry... WHAT?”

“A Tyrannosaurus Rex,” Unholy repeated proudly, like this was a perfectly normal thing to say. “60 feet tall. Claws like steak knives. Absolutely majestic. Cavemen practically worshipped me. One guy started calling me The Angry Thunder Chicken.”

“You’re telling me,” Elena said slowly, “that you used to terrorize cavemen as a giant dinosaur?”

“Oh yeah,” Unholy said proudly, pouring himself coffee like he owned the place. “Sometimes I’d roar just for effect. Other times I’d just stand there... silently.” He paused, smiling fondly. “Really freaked them out. Nothing unsettles a caveman quite like a T-Rex just... watching you build a fire.”

“Why?” Elena demanded. “Why would you even do that?”

Unholy shrugged. “I was figuring out my vibe. The whole ‘tall, dark, and charming’ look?” He gestured to himself with a dramatic flourish of the robe. “Didn’t happen overnight. The T-Rex phase? Iconic — but honestly? Kinda inconvenient.” He sighed dramatically. “You ever try squeezing your giant lizard head into a cave to collect a soul? My arms couldn’t even reach past my chest! Awful design.”

“Yeah, tragic,” Cassie muttered. “Truly the dinosaur was nature’s greatest victim.”

“Oh, they felt bad for me sometimes,” Unholy mused. “One tribe started giving me goats. Not as sacrifices — just... stress goats. I’d stomp around all mad, and they’d roll out a goat like, ‘Here, big guy, chill out. Pet the goat.’” He sipped his coffee, smiling fondly. “Cavemen? Total innovators.”

Cassie grinned. “Okay, that's actually adorable.”

“Right?” Unholy beamed. “But noooo, management didn’t like it. Said a towering reptile wasn’t ‘on-brand.’” He rolled his eyes dramatically, adjusting his pink robe again like it physically pained him to say the words. “Now I’m stuck like this. Don’t get me wrong —” He posed smugly. “— I wear this well. But honestly?” He leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I kinda miss the T-Rex thing.”

“Well,” Elena said dryly, “if you ever decide to rejoin the dinosaur circuit, let me know so I can book a flight. To, like... Japan.”

“Relax,” Unholy said, sprawling onto the couch like he paid rent. “I’m a guest in your home. It’s not like I’m about to—”

The lamp beside him flickered violently, sparked, and exploded with the force of a caffeine-fueled raccoon in a power box.

“—accidentally channel dark energy through your wiring,” Unholy finished with a wince.

“Oh good,” Elena muttered. “Because what this house really needed was an electrically unstable demon in a pink robe.”

“I’ll fix it,” Unholy said confidently, waving his hand.

“With what tools?” Cassie asked. “Unless you’ve got a demonic Home Depot in your pocket.”

Unholy smirked. “I don’t need tools.” He held up his hands like a magician about to cut someone in half. “I have... Demonic Energy.”

Cassie stared blankly. “So... you’re about to magic-fix a lamp?”

“Absolutely.”

“You’ve done this before, right?” Elena asked warily.

“Pfft.” Unholy scoffed. “I once rewired an entire castle in the 13th century using nothing but demonic energy and blind optimism.”

“How’d that turn out?” Cassie asked.

“Well... the north tower did catch fire,” Unholy admitted. “But I maintain that was mostly structural rot and, like, one-third my fault.”

Elena groaned. “Fine. Fix the lamp. But if my house burns down, I’m haunting you.”

Unholy cracked his knuckles like a man preparing to do something deeply ill-advised. “Prepare to be amazed.”

He grabbed the lamp, narrowed his eyes, and muttered something that sounded like a cat being sucked into a vacuum cleaner.

The lamp flickered. Buzzed.

And then —


BOOM!

The lamp shot across the room like a missile, embedding itself in the wall above Elena’s bookshelf.

“TA-DA!” Unholy declared proudly, posing like he’d just won an Olympic medal.

Cassie howled with laughter. “Oh my GOD, you’re terrible at this!”

“Okay, okay,” Unholy said, raising his hands in surrender. “I may have overdone it.”

“You think?” Elena snapped, pointing at the still-smoking hole in her wall. “You turned my lamp into a surface-to-air missile!”

“Well,” Unholy muttered, sipping his coffee like a man who no longer respected consequences, “at least nobody’s dead.”

“I might die,” Cassie wheezed between giggles. “From joy.”

Elena glared at Unholy. “From now on, you’re forbidden from ‘helping.’”

“Fair,” Unholy said, still proudly adjusting the pink robe. “But I’m pretty sure that lamp had bad vibes. Honestly? I did you a favor.”

“Yeah, sure,” Elena muttered. “Next time, just punch a hole in my wall directly. Save us all the suspense.”

“Noted,” Unholy said with a smug grin.

Cassie wiped tears from her eyes. “I can’t believe this is only day one.”

“Three days,” Elena muttered to herself. “Three days and this lunatic is gone.”

“Or,” Unholy chimed in cheerfully, “three days... and you’ll love having me around so much you’ll beg me to stay!”

Elena shot him a deadpan look. “I would sooner invite back my toxic ex and let him DJ my funeral.”

Unholy’s grin stretched wide.

“Challenge accepted.”

Recently I’ve realized that I could use some friends in my life and I’ve been trying things like Bumble BFF etc. to find some new people to meet. I also go to an affirming church, so I know a lot of people through that, but dont necessarily consider any of them my friends. In the past (like high school) I’ve had primarily male friends, but since then I’ve found it easier to make female friends.

Even if I find a match on Bumble BFF (which I haven’t had any luck so far) I’m not sure what types of activities a man would be interested in doing with another man. Or there’s a particular guy at my church that I’m interested in developing a deeper friendship, but I’m not sure how to go about that either.

This is not fiction and I just need to get it off my chest anonymously. I’ll probably delete that at some point. I just want to know, if you were me, which concrete actionable steps would you take? 

I’ve been naive and weak the whole time, so please don’t judge or lash out on me for my stupidity. I’m just here to vent. I have no one to share this with and I’m not brave enough to get therapy, so I’m going to share it here. It feels safer and no one can reach me. 

I’ve been in a “relationship” for over ten years, and I recently discovered just how much of a lie it was. We’re two men in a closeted relationship, which has only added to my isolation—no one knows about us, and he used that to his advantage, I think. Because you see, we were basically in hiding, living in our cocoon. I honestly thought it was the two of us against the world. But it turns out that within “the two of us”, there was much more hidden than I thought. There was much more hidden underneath it all and it has left deep cuts within me. I’m not even sure how I’m ever going to trust someone now.  

Looking back, it’s clear he did everything he could to impress me, control me, and make sure I didn’t leave. I don’t mean violence, of course. He wasn’t violent at all, but he was incredibly selfish. He wanted to have me, to keep me hooked, to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere. That made me want to leave him on several occasions and our relationships has seen rocky paths over the years. I realise now that he’s also used this as an excuse for everything I’m about to share. Many times he said to me “but it wasn’t clear”, which made me feel guilty. With hindsight, consciously or unconsciously, the blame was put on me just with this simple statement. I’ll agree to this though: I have wanted something else, something different, something safer, and I think this was the reason for my trying to break up with him a few times. My subconscious was probably trying to tell me something. Due to this, there were many times I wouldn’t indulge in sex with him. I was honestly struggling with my identify already enough. The more he was pushing to get some dirty action with me, the more he was met with a wall. Him being very sexually driven didn’t help. So it was more like on and off and on and off and off off off and on and off, etc. He was frustrated but later will have shared with me that he got used to our little system. 

As I said, he wanted me so much. And yet, at the same time, he was out there sleeping with 10+ random strangers. I couldn’t even make this up if I wanted to. I can’t make sense of it—if I was so important to him, if he was ready to go to the greatest lengths to manipulate me into staying, if he was SO desperate for me to stay, why was he betraying me over and over again? And if he knew or thought the relationship we had was done and over and would never amount to anything, doesn’t that make the situation worse? He knew our relationship was bound to end so he just took advantage of me all these years?

Recently, I’ve had an awakening and discovered so many things that have left me baffled for life, so many red flags that I had been ignoring. How he subtly manipulated me into submission, for one, or how he brainwashed me without me realising it. I’ve had many chats with him since then and he’s admitting to all of this, by the way. But it doesn’t make it hurt any less. I kid you not, mental manipulation and gaslighting is a real fucking thing. And I consider myself a pretty smart guy. Yet, I’ve been duped and stupid all these years. 

I swear, this is all going to sound crazy but please don’t judge. I know what you’re going to say: “why didn’t you run a long time ago?! Why did you stay?!” But bear in mind that I was an afraid young closeted boy. Ok, here you go… I’ve discovered that over the years, he has done the following: 

10+ years ago:

	•	Stolen from me behind my back, leaving me wondering if I was insane—my ID and my keys (to prevent me from going out), even private photos (some sexy, some mundane photos of me that I had shared with no one) 
	•	Snooped around in my devices. I caught him checking my phone, my messages, my computer, my bag, my camera… He had photos and videos of me which were only accessible through my devices…
	•	Secretly taken non-consensual videos and photos of me and my privates at the beginning when we were discovering ourselves and kept them for over ten years without my knowledge.
	•	Created fake online accounts at the beginning of our relationship and interacted with me through them, passing off as his best mates to make him seem cool. 
	•	Possibly (very high possibility) even created a fake girlfriend just to mess with my head and make me believe he was happy and sexually active with girls (when we were once again still discovering ourselves and each other). 
	•	Largely contributed in my isolation over time. I’m not sure how to explain or put this into words. It was like this invisible hand over my shoulder, invisible shackles on my wrists. I felt like I needed his agreement for anything and everything, even when we were talking to recently made friends, I felt I needed his approval for what I was sharing, how I was interacting, and what we’d do with them. He wouldn’t prevent me to go anywhere but it was a mutual agreement that it was him and me. Only, I didn’t know it was him and me, and a dozen other guys as far as I know. 

The only thing I had discovered 10 years ago regarding all the above was the stealing of my stuff and the violation breach of my electronics. I remember getting mad and managing to make him admit the whole thing. This was probably one of the reasons why, from then on, our path was to get rocky. Probably the reason for my leaving attempts. But time went on, and he had shown how sorry he’d been about the whole thing. He’d explain that he was crazy about me, didn’t want to lose me and didn’t know how to handle it. Mind you, I even found this cute at some point. He wanted me so much he was going above and beyond for me to stay with him. How fucked up is this. 

Recent days:

	•	Cheated continuously, meeting up with random strangers towards the later years and hooking up online (I guess you can call it cybersex) since the very beginning. 
	•	Gaslit, manipulated, and outright lied to me—even when I confronted him with undeniable proof of his cheating. I mean, he was literally insisting this is all bullshit and he literally made me read a filthy screenshot conversation to prove my point (I’m not proud of myself but I had to go full on detective mode and hacked into his account… so I saw many things, amongst raunchy and very explicit chats, photos and videos of himself with other guys). 
	•	Kept denying when I was adding details and feeding me “trickle truths,” never telling me the full story (believe me, the full story is too crazy for me to share) forcing me to dig through the mess myself, hack some more for details (as I was in a state of disbelief) and fight for those details. Of course, he lied through his teeth and swore it was all nonsense, but every time I was pushing through with additional claims, he ended up with having no more choice but to admit. The evidence was irrefutable. 
	•	Lived with me for ten plus years, pretending everything was fine, while building this entire double Iife, or life of secrets behind my back.
	•	Maintained an eight-year-long cybersex friendship with one of these random guys, exchanging explicit messages and meeting up briefly in real life over coffee. 
	•	talked about me to these online encounters, labelling me as the “boyfriend”, making it seem cool that he was engaging in such acts despite having me as his “boyfriend”. I’m talking statements like “my boyfriend is in the shower (kinky emoji)”, “I have a boyfriend but I’m being naughty (kinky emoji)”. 

I think that’s about it. Oh boy… How many time we talked about our situation and what we should do: “what are we?” And all the like. When I was confronting him regarding the cheating, he even said “all I want is for me to be able to say to my friends ‘hey, I’m with (my name)’”.

Now here’s the thing. He wanted me to stay. He “thought I was going to leave him” due to our past (his words). He did all of this to keep me. But at the same time, he was out cheating with anyone he could find on or offline. It makes no sense. Was it about control? Did he just want to make sure I was trapped while he did whatever he wanted? 

Honestly, there’s no word for the comfort and safety I felt all these years around him. He played so well. I thought we were safe together. He was crazy about me, there was no reason for me to ever suspect anything. If anything, I was the one always doubting and wanting to leave him on several occasions. That’s why I had never looked at it from this point of view. He also did these things in the most vicious possible way, thinking I would never find out about his lack of morals, integrity and fun escapades. But I did. And it all crumbled down from there. 

All these years of comfort created with him down the drain. All these years of intense connection I thought we had, just to find out he’s not who I thought he was? Just to finish on that note? We’ve been hiding forever, just him and I, just for me to figure THAT out ten years down the line? I feel ridiculous. I feel ashamed. I’ve isolated myself all these years from the people I like in my life. I’ve lied to them by not showing my authenticity and I don’t know how to go back and make it right. I don’t even live in my native country anymore and I’ve not created any more connections with others since living with him, as it was just always me and him. On the other hand, he’s got friends, he goes out all the time. The fact that I’m only waking up now is crazy to me. All the red flags were here. And I’m completely lucid about all the facts now, about the fact that it’s insane. I now feel like the liar in my life, like I’ve let so many other people down, but they don’t even know… it’s all been too hard to digest.

People online tell me to run, that this is abuse, that he’s a master manipulator. And I know they’re right. But after ten years of being lied to, isolated, and controlled, and only coming to the realisation of it all recently, it’s like my brain doesn’t know how to process the depth of this betrayal. I know what I need to do but I can’t get myself to do it. We still live together although we don’t have anything to say to each other. It’s gone past the point of ridiculous. Cause we both know it’s basically over and I won’t recover from this. I can’t. Who can? And the weird thing is it’s not so much that it’s over that hurts me, it’s that all of this happened in the first place, and I didn’t stop it. I watched myself get abused. I poured all my trust out to him, and I blindly followed like a puppy, and he was completely aware of all of this and of all he was doing... all, this, time. And there’s no getting this back. And I’m worried about how to trust anyone and feel safe. I know I’m grieving. I’m very logical about this. My brain understands, but I just don’t know how to move forward. I’m grieving an entire version of my life that I now realise to be a lie. It was the shittiest moment of my life and I’m slowly recovering, but the highs and lows are maniac. I wish I was confident enough to own my life and be my authentic self. I know it will happen soon.

1jl9b5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jl9b5w/aitah_wife_refuses_to_cut_off_ap/,AITAH - Wife refuses to cut off AP,"Long story very short, after her mom passed and during her grief, my wife (34F) went to a mutual male friend of ours, who is single, and complained about me (43M) to him.  There were signs of an emerging emotion affair, and I confronted her about it in August of 2023.  It had been going on for some months by that point.

She claims that there was no physical cheating or romantic interest towards him.  For what it's worth, I believe her (she's a terrible liar and I can always spot her hiding or obscuring the truth).  That said, she had still broken my trust by violating several boundaries previously established in our marriage (I'm not allowed to vent to my friends about her, regardless of gender, and she's not at all comfortable with me having close female friends or spending time alone with other women)

For the record, they were on text/snap all day every day, they went to dinner alone together, and when she was supposed to be with a large group of friends, she and he hung out together afterwards.  He was making special trips to bring her coffee at her job (while I was at work).  They were buying each other gifts.

When I confronted her and saw it looks like an affair, or at the very least an emotional affair, she rebuffed me.  I asked her to cut off contact, and while she didn't agree to completely cut him off, she agreed to stop the texting/gifts/hanging out alone.

Within weeks, those boundaries had been broken.  When I held her to account, I was told that she didn't cheat, therefore she didn't do anything wrong.  I reiterated that my expectation was for her to keep her distance from him. 

Within weeks, same thing.

Soon, a rumor started in our social circle about their affair that painted her in a negative light and me as a cuckold.  She *finally* agreed that it might have looked bad and agreed to keep her distance.

Weeks, boom.  Back in contact.

This cycle of repeated breaking of boundaries occurred several times, with me finally saying ""Look, the expectation from this point forward is no contact.  I know it's tricky because we attend church with him, but if he says hello, you keep walking.  No contact means no contact""

Two weeks ago, she engaged him in conversation in front of me, asking about his ailing dad.  She says it was innocent, but I said it still breaks the no contact rule.

During our argument later that day, she self-harmed in front of me in a fit of rage.

I gave her an ultimatum, get psychic help or we're done.  She did start getting help.

Since then, we've hashed out everything in fine detail, but she still believes that since she didn't actually fuck him, I have no right to place this requirement on her.  I can't seem to get through to her that is not whether or not she fucked him, but the fact that she holds me to very strict standards that she refuses to adhere to herself.

What am I to do?  What am I getting wrong here?  She says I'm ""not allowing her to be herself"" by insisting on no contact, but he's the *only* person, and only because of what happened.

Am I being unreasonable here?  I feel like the only option left is another ultimatum.  I don't like resorting to that (even though I've been on the receiving end of several).  We have two kids together who need both of us.  I don't want this to end in divorce.

1jl9arv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub/comments/1jl9arv/new_coffeeloader_malware_targets_windows_users_by/,New CoffeeLoader Malware Targets Windows Users by Impersonating ASUS Utility,"
**A new malware called CoffeeLoader is fooling users into downloading it by masquerading as ASUS's Armoury Crate while employing sophisticated techniques to evade antivirus detection.**

**Key Points:**

- Impersonates popular ASUS software to deliver malicious payloads.
- Utilizes GPU to run code, avoiding detection by most security tools.
- Employs Call Stack Spoofing to obscure malicious activities.
- Uses Sleep Obfuscation to hide within the system's memory.
- Accesses Windows Fibers to evade conventional monitoring.

The CoffeeLoader malware represents a significant threat for Windows users, as it effectively disguises itself as a legitimate utility from ASUS, a trusted brand known for its gaming laptops. By mimicking the appearance and function of the Armoury Crate software, malware authors attempt to trick users into downloading and installing it, believing they are enhancing their systems. Once installed, CoffeeLoader immediately begins to harvest sensitive information via various infostealers, including the notorious Rhadamanthys Infostealer. This tactic highlights the growing trend of cybercriminals exploiting well-known brands to gain a foothold in users' systems.

How can we improve awareness and security measures to better protect against malware that impersonates legitimate software?

Zines, short for “fanzine,” are self-published booklets consisting of original or reproduced images and texts, traditionally produced through a copy machine. Zines provided a method of giving artists, especially historically marginalized ones, a voice.In the 1960s, zines became a tool for Black feminists to use to address white supremacy, the patriarchy, and issues regarding intersectionality in the women’s liberation movement. They became popular during the 1980s underground feminist punk movement, better known as the Riot Grrrl Movement. In the early 2000s, LGBTQ+ publications, such as QZAP (Queer Zine Archive Project) sought out to preserve queer zines and have them be available to various communities. Nowadays, libraries and bookstores carry collections of zines signifying how far they’ve come!The event will be located at Tally Print Studio, Common Ground Books, 621 Art Gallery, and The Bark. Each location will have lots of artists, musicians and, at select locations, food vendors. Tally Print Studio will have Zine related workshops and activities.

So the barista runs the hot coffee onto his hands and it obviously burns, and then the barista asks if he'd like some milk with that, and he pleadingly says yes - implying that that would help with the burn. Haha.

Just wrapped up my **first solo trip to Kazakhstan**, and it was nothing short of amazing. From snowy surprises to local connections, here’s a breakdown of my **7-day adventure in Almaty** during **Nauryz**—the city was alive, and so was I!

# 🗓️ Day 1 – Exploring Almaty’s Heart

* Morning stroll with **coffee and French bread** (became my go-to breakfast spot).
* Visited **Panfilov Park** and **Ascension Cathedral**—unfortunately, the **28 Soldiers Statue** was under renovation.
* Checked out **Green Bazaar** (saved shopping for the last day).
* Rode up to **Kok Tobe**—fun spot but better to visit in the **evening**.
* Friendly **students** helped me set up the **Onay app** for easy bus travel.
* Evening at **Arbat Street**—**crowded, fun, and full of energy** thanks to Nauryz celebrations.

# 🚇 Day 2 – Metro Rides & City Wandering

* Tried the **metro**—super easy, accepts **Visa/international cards**.
* Booked a **2-day tour** to the lakes and canyons.
* Explored **President Park** and **Botanical Garden**—beautiful but dry, spring/summer would be more scenic.
* Evening strolls back at **Arbat**—met people, had conversations, but overall, a slower day.

# 💤 Day 3 – Rest & Prepping for the Adventure

* Visited the **Central Mosque**.
* Tried **Kazakh food** at the famous **Qagnat** canteen.
* Evening exploration for coffee before the **group tour** began.
* **Night bus** to **Saty village**—the adventure was about to start!

# 🏞️ Day 4 & 5 – Lakes, Canyons & Local Vibes

* Joined a **group tour** to explore **Kazakhstan’s stunning lakes and canyons**—the landscapes were breathtaking.
* Stayed with **local hosts** in **Saty village**, enjoying authentic **Kazakh hospitality** and home-cooked food.
* Had **cognac** at night with two fellow travelers—good company, better drinks! *(DM me if you want more details about this tour—it was worth it!)*

# ❄️ Day 6 – Snowfall Surprise & Shymbulak Magic

* Woke up to a **surprise snowfall**—a dream come true!
* Took the **cable car** to **Shymbulak**—an **unreal snowy experience** (though the hot chocolate was a letdown).
* Tried **Beshbarmak** with **horse meat** at **Navat**—an interesting taste of tradition.
* Ended the night with **shashlik** (kebabs) and **cognac**—**love at first taste**. Arbat Street was **quiet** and snow-covered—peaceful and beautiful.

# 💙 Day 7 – A Bittersweet Goodbye

* Woke up feeling **sad**—the final day always hits different.
* Bought **dry fruits** from **Green Bazaar** and **chocolates** from **Rakhat** as souvenirs.
* Spent my last afternoon with a **local friend**—we wandered parks, shared meals, watched the sunset, and simply **soaked in the city one last time**. It was the **perfect ending** to a **perfect trip**.

✅ **Final Thoughts:**  
Kazakhstan stole my heart—**Almaty’s mix of nature, culture, and warmth** made this solo adventure unforgettable. If you’re considering a trip, **just do it**—you might even wake up to a **surprise snowfall** like I did!

Choosing the ‌right **scent⁣ air diffuser** requires careful consideration of your specific needs and business environment. Here are some key factors ⁤to ‌consider:

## Deep⁢ Dive: Cold Air Diffusion Technology

Many of ‌the top‍ **scent air diffusers** mentioned utilize **cold air diffusion technology**. What is it, and why ⁢is it superior ⁢to traditional methods like nebulizers⁣ or ​evaporative ​diffusers?

Cold ​air diffusion, also known ⁤as nebulizing or atomizing diffusion, ‍works by using pressurized air to break‍ down fragrance oils ⁢into a fine, dry mist. This mist ​is​ then released into the air, where it disperses evenly and consistently⁤ without altering the​ chemical composition of the oil.

Here's why this‍ technology is superior:

* ​  **Consistent‌ Scent Delivery:** ‌Ensures a consistent and even ​scent experience throughout the space.
*  ​ **no Heat or Water:** Eliminates the risk of altering the fragrance's chemical composition,preserving⁤ its‌ integrity and therapeutic benefits. Also, no moisture is added to⁣ the environment which can trigger mold issues.
*  ‌ **Fine Particle Size:** ⁣The fine mist allows for better suspension in the air, maximizing scent coverage and longevity.
*   **No Residue:** The dry ​mist leaves no oily residue ⁣on surfaces.
*   **Energy Efficient:** Cold air diffusers typically consume less energy ​than heat-based systems.
*   **Reduced Fragrance⁢ Wastage:** Cold air diffusion​ is highly efficient, using less fragrance⁣ oil to achieve the desired scent level.

For businesses ⁤seeking a high-performance and cost-effective‌ scenting solution, **cold⁢ air ⁣diffusion technology**⁤ is the clear choice.

1jl92tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ww1/comments/1jl92tn/account_of_french_soldiers_trapped_under_endless/,Account of French Soldiers trapped under endless barrage at Verdun.,"I found this years ago where someone had translated this page here: [Jean Giono à Verdun – Blog du prof d'histoire – géo qui est aussi coordo ULIS](https://pierrickauger.wordpress.com/2016/05/29/jean-giono-a-verdun/)

It's an extract from the  book Recherche de la pureté (1939) by Jean Giono, which I dont believe has an english translation.

The link to the translation died years ago but I remembered being horrified by the picture painted by this young man's words. I went ahead and ran it through an online translator to present here.

You can feel the anger and despair the soldiers feel about being forced to be in this horrible place:

>""You will soon understand that these dirty and low material things are much more important to you than all the superior spirit of combat. Suddenly in the middle of a battle that seemed to be unfolding for legitimate spiritual needs, you feel that in reality you have been illegally imposed a simple debate between yourself and pain, yourself and the necessity to live, yourself and the desire to live, that everything is there; that if you simply die, there is no more battle, no homeland, no right, no reason, no victory, no defeat and thus you are simply made to painfully strive towards nothingness. There is no epic, however glorious it may be, that can make the respect of its glory surpass the necessities of a digestive tube. The one who built the epic with the suffering of his body knows that in these so-called moments of glory, in truth, baseness occupies the sky. Under the iron of Verdun, the soldiers hold on. For a place I know, we hold on because the gendarmes prevent us from leaving. Posts have been placed even in the middle of the battle, in the support trenches, above the Tavannes tunnel. If you want to get out of there, you need an exit ticket. Idiotic but exact; not idiotic, terrible. At the beginning of the battle, when some soup details still manage to pass through the artillery barrage, upon arrival, they have to search their cartridge belts and show the gendarmes the ticket signed by the captain. The heroism of the official communiqué must be carefully controlled here. We can well say that if we stay on this battlefield, it is because we are carefully prevented from escaping. Finally, we are here, we stay here; so we fight? We give the impression of fierce attackers; in reality, we flee in all directions. We are between the hospital battery, a small fort, and the Fort de Vaux, which we must reconquer. This has been going on for ten days. Every day, at the hospital battery, between two rows of sandbags, those called deserters on the spot are executed without trial with a revolver. You cannot leave the battlefield, so now you hide there. You dig a hole, you bury yourself, you stay there. If they find you, they drag you to the battery and, between two rows of sandbags, they blow your brains out. Soon, each man will have to be accompanied by a gendarme. The general says ""they hold on."" In Paris, there is a historian who is preparing to conjugate the verb ""to hold on at Verdun"" in all tenses and persons (including his own). They hold on, but I, the general, would not dare to remove the gendarmes or advise leniency to this colonel of the 52nd infantry who is at the hospital battery. This has been going on for fifteen days.

>For eight days, the soup details have not returned. They leave in the evening in the dark night and that's it, they dissolve like sugar in coffee. Not a single man has returned. They have all been killed, absolutely all, every time, every day without exception. We don't go anymore. We are hungry. We are thirsty. We see over there a dead man lying on the ground, rotten and full of flies but still belted with canteens and bread balls passed through a wire. We wait for the bombardment to calm down. We crawl to him. We detach the bread balls from his body. We take the full canteens. Other canteens have been pierced by bullets. The bread is soft. You just have to cut the piece that touched the body. This is what we do all day. This has been going on for twenty-five days. For a long time, there have been no more of these pantry corpses. We eat anything. I chew a canteen strap. Towards evening, a buddy arrived with a rat. Once skinned, the flesh is white as paper. But, with my piece in hand, I still wait for the dark night before eating. We have an opportunity for tomorrow: a machine gun that arrived a while ago as reinforcement was crushed with its four servants twenty meters behind us. Later, we will go get the bags of these four men. They came from the battery. They must have brought food for themselves. But we must not let those on our right go before us. They must also be watching from inside their hole. We watch. The important thing is that the four are dead. They are. Good. This has been going on for thirty days.

>It is the great battle of Verdun. The whole world has its eyes fixed on us. We have terrible worries. To win? To resist? To hold on? To do our duty? No. To relieve ourselves. Outside, it is a deluge of iron. It is very simple: a shell of each caliber falls every minute and per square meter. We are nine survivors in a hole. It is not a shelter, but the forty centimeters of earth and logs above our heads are in front of our eyes a sort of visor against horror. Nothing in the world will make us leave there. But what we have eaten, what we eat wakes up several times a day in our stomach. We have to relieve ourselves. The first of us who had to go out; for two days he has been there, three meters in front of us, dead with his pants down. We relieve ourselves on paper and throw it there in front. We have done it on old letters we kept. We are nine in a space where normally barely three could fit tightly. We are a little more squeezed. Our legs and arms are entangled. When you want to bend your knee, we all have to make the movements that will allow it. The earth of our shelter trembles around us constantly. Constantly the gravel, dust, and shrapnel blow into this side that is open to the outside. The one near this sort of door has his face and hands scratched by a thousand small scratches. We no longer hear the explosions of the shells; we only hear the hammer blow of arrival. It is an uninterrupted pounding. We have been in there for five days without moving. We no longer have paper, any of us. We relieve ourselves in our bags and throw them outside. You have to untangle your arms from the other arms, and pull down your pants, and relieve yourself in a bag that is resting on a buddy's stomach. When you are done, you pass the filth to the one in front, who passes it to the other who throws it outside. Seventh day. The battle of Verdun continues. More and more heroes. We still do not leave our hole. We are only eight. The one who was in front of the door was killed by a big shrapnel that came right in, cut his throat, and bled him. We tried to block the door with his body. We did well. A sort of grazing fire that has specialized for a few hours on this piece of sector makes shrapnel rain down on us. We hear them hitting the body that blocks the door. Despite being bled like a pig with the carotid artery open, he still bleeds with each of these wounds he receives after his death. I forgot to say that for more than ten days none of us has a rifle, cartridges, knife, or bayonet. But we have more and more this terrible need that does not stop, that tears us apart. Especially since we tried to swallow small balls of earth to calm the hunger, and also because it rained that night and, as we had not drunk for four days, we licked the rainwater that trickled through the logs and also the one that came from outside and flowed into us under the corpse that blocks the door. We relieve ourselves in our hand. It is dysentery that flows between our fingers. We can't even manage to throw it outside. Those at the back wipe their hands in the earth next to them. The three near the door wipe themselves on the dead man's clothes. This is how we realize that we are bleeding. Thick but absolutely vermilion blood. Beautiful. That one thought it was the dead man he was wiping on who was bleeding. But the beauty of the blood made him think.

>It has been four days now that this corpse blocks the door and we are on August 9, and we can see that it is rotting. That one had relieved himself in his right hand; he passed his left hand to his behind; he pulled it out full of this fresh blood. During that day, we all realize in turn that we are bleeding. So, we relieve ourselves right there, under us. I said that we have not had weapons for a long time; but, we all have our cup passed through a strap of our equipment because we are at all times devoured by a burning thirst, and from time to time we drink our urine. It is the admirable battle of Verdun.

>Two years later, at the Chemin des Dames, we will revolt (at that time I was the only survivor of these last eight) for similar ignominies. Not at all for great reasons, not at all against the war, not at all to give peace to the earth, not at all for great slogans, simply because we are tired of relieving ourselves in our hand and drinking our urine. Simply because at the bottom of the army, the individual has touched the vile.""",14,1743095537.0,ww1,6,1.0,False

As what the title says, I’m a 30yo female from Asia looking for long term penpals! I’m married with kids, so strictly platonic only, would prefer to speak and write to women only, thank you 🌻

I’ve responded to a few enquiries on here with no luck - I might be too boring for them 🤪
I’m chronically online, so you can pen stuff down in your letters about the latest memes, celebrity gossip - I’m happy to talk about anything!

I’m an atheist, so no religious talks, please :) 

I don’t really do maximalist care packages, so if you’re looking for a penpal who’ll send you cute trinkets, snacks, gifts etc I’m probably not the one. Similarly, I don’t expect it from you. I think this is the fastest way to burnout and be tired and run out of ideas (and money! but maybe I’m just old and old fashioned) 
I prefer getting a letter hearing about your day, about that coworker that pissed you off, about the lovely barista that made your coffee order right, the rush hour traffic making you annoyed…etc

And the real reason Houthis (and the Blowfish) are always so pissed.","Spiegel is now reporting what everyone was worried about, after the most inept cabinet members in history directly participated the most inept security breech in history.

Spiegel confirmed that Hegseth, Waltz, and Gabbard's personal private data and passwords are strewn all across the internet, like clothing on the floor of a cheap hotel tryst, allowing everyone's 13 year old nephew to get into everything they don't apparently know they've put into apparently all of the clouds.

Worse than that, after ""Premature Pete"" excitedly notified all of his new found Trump lottery co-wieners, and pre-announced the exact details of his first (of possibly many?) toy military operation, Spiegel checked and has confirmed that the Signal accounts used are in fact tied to phone numbers, that anyone can find and use to hack into.

So has anyone done it? We have to assume they have.

Apparently there's a security rule that if you break it, is a firing rule, that you're not allowed to use Signal to send out classified information.

Which is why the information that the ""The Three Pendejos"" clearly relished sending, reading, and congratulating to each other, was instantly publicly and therefore officially de-Classified by Trump. Although he didn't know he was doing it.

So even though they should, they won't be fired.

But what about the Houthis? Allegedly a ""terrorist"" leader and some other stuff was targeted in this fiasco. Again. This ""Operation"" was one of over 260 US and UK attacks on the Houthis over the past year. Retaliation for the Houthis attacking (Oil) ships in the Gulf. Like Iran, the Houthis really hate Israel. And are using Iranian supplied weapons and missiles to attack the (Oil) ships in the Gulf in retaliation for Israel's attacks on Gaza. Israel is attacking Gaza in retaliation for the October 7th Hamas attack. And the shit begets more shit, and the shit never ends.

The Houthis ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until they were removed from power in 1962 by, you guessed it, the British.

But what no one (Goddamn) remembers or even knows anymore is that Yemen invented drinking coffee as a popular modern beverage, by roasting coffee beans and brewing the now most popular drink in the world.

The other thing Yemen invented? Sugar.

So not being given credit for the two most popular contributions to the world is probably the real reason why the Houthis are pissed off all of the time.

But I digress.

Then used this excellent ComfyUI workflow made by Kijai to make the video: [https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/blob/main/example\_workflows/wanvideo\_480p\_I2V\_endframe\_example\_01.json](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/blob/main/example_workflows/wanvideo_480p_I2V_endframe_example_01.json)

Anyway, I do see the value in sooo much of it, so I really want to understand what the LD approach would be to my situation and give it an effort. 

My husband is so unbelievably loving and attentive, responsible, and a fantastic communicator most of the time. There’s so much to be grateful for and I voice my appreciation so often. But in times of stress, he can be so hard on me, and when he feels like I’ve done something to justifiably upset him, he responds with very mean words, refuses any explanation I offer that’s not a 100% admission of guilt and apology, and even when I do apologize he doesn’t immediately accept it - he stays angry and avoids me for hours or even days. 

We both work in very high-powered jobs. Since day 1 he’s said he loves that about me, that he wouldn’t ever want me to not be a working wife/mom (he grew up with a working mom), and even though he’s more recently voiced that he’d love for me to be able to step back when we have kids, until then he really loves the salary that I can command and should keep grinding a few more years so we can be more comfortable stepping back later.  He usually makes me feel so supported and encouraged in my career, proudly talks about it to all our friends and family too, but I sense that there’s also some insecurity there, both around my level of success as well as what it means in terms of the other male interactions and attention it entails. We’ve often had friction around the boundaries/liberties I’m able to set/take - being able to text during the work day, leaving office early or working remote occasionally, and blocking off evening time if calls/emails come in. Since I’m in a leadership role, there aren’t black and white rules for me, but I feel like I already stretch the limits of those things, sometimes at the expense of my job performance (I’ve made that choice deliberately, because I value my life outside of work and especially my relationship more). But I don’t think my husband appreciates how much I’ve already stretched there, and it feels like he doesn’t trust my judgment when I say certain times I need to buckle down more. I’ve actually expressed that I’m not happy with this job and the level of responsibility it entails, he always challenges me on that and says I should be making the most of this opportunity.

I’m right now in one of the highest pressure crunch times of my career, with my job potentially on the line and a lot of coworkers/reports depending on me, so I’m under a tremendous amount of stress. I had to travel out of town yesterday after getting only two hours of sleep, and got back in the late afternoon. My husband had called me saying he was getting lunch at our favorite spot - I said I was jealous, I’d be up for having it for dinner if he did something else for lunch. Miscommunication #1 - he took that to mean he’d wait for me to get back to eat, and I think he did tell me that so even though I’d rather him have not waited and just eaten something, I think that was on me for not making that clear. Anyway, when I got home he was still working too even though he was starving, so we waited until he reached a stopping point. I really didn’t even want to go eat at all because I had so much work still to do, but I knew he’d waited for me so I was committed to going. I did say that I’d have to keep monitoring work stuff and maybe even bring my laptop to the cafe, he said he might need to too. I ended up leaving my laptop behind, but I was dealing with a flurry of things on my phone and ended up dealing with that the entire time we were eating. I’m also navigating some ethical challenges with work, so even between doing work things I can be deep in thought and unable to focus on much else. I let my husband know what’s going on there and value his input on it, but he doesn’t always agree with how I choose to handle those things work-wise. 

Well, after we paid he stormed out of the cafe ahead of me and when I tried to put my arm on him affectionately, he brushed it away and made it clear he was upset. He said I spent all of the meal on my phone and not talking to him at all, and that’s not what he wants from a wife. I was at first confused and expressed that I thought he was working too / knew the level of urgency I was dealing with, but then also validated him that I was inattentive and apologized. I continued to apologize and say that I failed in setting proper expectations, but begged for some grace and understanding with all the pressure I’m under and especially while operating on 2 hours of sleep. 

He made it clear he didn’t want to talk - just said I’m an inconsiderate person and he’s putting his foot down. He doesn’t want to get all touchy feely Christian and give me grace for anything. He says it’s my actions that matter and I need to do better. I gave him space for a bit, tried apologizing again and expressed that he is the most important thing to me, above work, that I will try to do better with my time management and boundaries going forward.

He continued to be cold to me all evening and this morning before I left for work. I spent the evening folding some of our laundry that had piled up then went to bed early - I got him his favorite cold brew coffee in the AM, but he was still mad at me. I just said “well I love you and hope you have a good day” and he did say I love you too, but otherwise still ice cold. No communication since - normally we text a fair amount and share reels back and forth during the work day, so it’s clearly still a noticeable silent treatment. 

So I’m struggling with how much I should keep apologizing…. I DO see it from his side and genuinely feel bad that he was so eager to wait for me to eat at our favorite place together, and how I treated him was rude and disrespectful, whatever my reasons. But I also don’t think his response to me is at all fair, and I’m just craving some understanding and support in return. Since I’ve already apologized multiple times and he’s chosen not to accept it, the ball is in his court now, right? Do I just focus on my own self-care and allow him to have his own emotions, continue to treat him lovingly in the meantime but not try anything more to fix it? If further blame and mean words come, do I just take it and allow him to be 100% in the right, or is there any space for my own side/explanations/defense, and any way to show his overblown meanness is unacceptable in return? 

Actually just as I was about to post this he called… but only to ask if I’d fed the dogs this morning, and when I said I love and miss you he didn’t respond. :(

I’m at 100% P&T and he’s active duty. I would be able to move when our lease ends in September. The problem is I’m not sure where I would move to. 

A) my pay would go down to $3831/m so I couldn’t afford much in terms of housing 
B) we have a lot of pets and if we don’t rehome one I can’t see any other split except 5/1 with me getting 5 of the animals. This would also prevent me from being able to move to another country.


The only other option I see is if we stay married but see other people otherwise I’ll have to rehome the animals. I just don’t know what to do. 


Edit:

I want to live somewhere with all 4 seasons. I would enjoy enough snow to build a snowman but not enough that i have to shovel my way out to leave the house. I like mostly outdoor things, want to be around a good coffee shop, would prefer a good dog park, and need at least one bookstore. I would like to find somewhere I could get a 2 bed for ~$1300 but I’ve only ever lived in high COL areas so I don’t know if that’s reasonable. ",14,1743094896.0,VeteransBenefits,73,0.77,False

My ex broke up with me 2 months ago and I’m still struggling with the trauma from and after the relationship. Below I’ve listed some of the signs that I believe suggest he may have a narcissistic personality disorder and I wondered if anyone could confirm.

Insecure and a bit socially awkward at the beginning of our relationship. 

Said he didn’t like many people he met or people in general - said he didn’t like anyone at his uni or felt like no one liked him - said he felt like an alien and it would make him very upset/depressed thinking people didn’t like him.

High goals and quite intellectually smart - always talking highly of himself 

Didn’t like showing his emotions or being vulnerable to me except when on drugs. He’d introduce me to a lot of drugs and we’d do them together and I’d enjoy it because it was the only time when he’d express his emotions to me or act really loving towards me. Said he didn’t want to appear weak to me and wanted to be the perfect version of himself 

Had a porn addiction and lied to me about it constantly - even to my face when I had proof he would deny it and lie and do it again despite seeing how badly it affected me and the relationship and how insecure it made me

At the very end of our relationship he was physically abusive to me multiple times throughout the night - every time I’d wake him up to try talk to him he’d throw me/choke me and then would go straight back to sleep after without a care/showing no empathy despite me crying in pain. This went on all night, I couldn’t sleep I was so upset and shocked and he was fine and just slept. The next morning he wasn’t even apologetic, he was silent and refused to look or talk to me - but later said this was because he was feeling suicidal/having bad thoughts because of what he did. Now says he wasn’t in control of himself and that he felt disgusting and that maybe he was just bad.

After this incident and me still loving him, ghosted me for a week and refused to see me and then broke up with me a week later. Acted totally careless after the breakup, got high on cocaine by himself and rang me at 4am saying crazy and weird things to me and I was still caring and empathetic towards him. Didn’t check up on me after breakup. 

We did meet a couple times for coffee after the breakup but he would refuse to talk about the relationship and only himself. I think he agreed to see me as an ego boost - seeing how desperate and vulnerable I was for him. He would even say stuff to me like he would be happy to move on and talk to another girl anytime soon and I think he has a new girlfriend already after just a month - can’t stay single 

Very sexual and put me in dangerous sexual experiences and sexually impulsive. He even admitted after we broke up he was using me for sex at the beginning. Sex was also all about his needs and he failed to pleasure me or meet my sexual needs.

Acts extremely sweet or genuine to other people and doesn’t come across as a bad person at all. Even now I would describe him as a sweet, nerdy and genuine guy because I that is typically how he comes across. He said that i apparently brought out the worst in him and that’s one of the reasons why he broke up with me 

Ghosted me and gave me mixed signals after breakup. The last thing he texted me was that he had a sex dream about me and then hasn’t spoken to me since ",1,1743094857.0,NPDRelationships,0,1.0,False
1jl8rxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1jl8rxf/am_i_doing_too_much/,Am I doing too much?,"I am asking this with regard to my baby’s needs and any issues I may be causing for him in terms of attachment etc because I can’t think of many reasons why this may be a bad thing. Please tell me if there’s something I’m not thinking about. 

I am 7 weeks pp, very easy birth and very easy healthy baby so far (I am very grateful). 

He eats every 3ish hours, has a few naps during the day and sleeps for minimum 3 hour stretches at night. Sometimes up to 6 hours which is magical. Don’t ask me how because I haven’t quite figured out what the magic ingredient is.  

I spend time doing tummy time, black and white cards, talking to him, nursing him, taking him on walks, baby and mama yoga, coffee shops, retail therapy, cuddling him, some contact napping…

But I’m also doing work stuff. Not a lot, but it’s my husbands company and I have started taking on some of my responsibilities again. Not a huge amount, but today I took some of the team to do something that took a couple of hours. Baby was upset in the car on the way back to the office so I stopped to nurse him but he’s been a bit fussy since. He’s been a bit fussier over the last couple of days, eating more often and sleeping a bit less. 

I voicenoted a friend who has a toddler and my baby started crying so I stopped the voice note. Got back to her after I had soothed him and told her he had been a bit fussy. 

The response I got was her basically telling me I was doing too much. She said that when she had her baby at this age, she would be at home watching movies and going on walks. She said that he’s fussy because he is doing too much. This isn’t the first time she’s hinted at this or told me I’m doing too much. 

I have heard people say to fit a baby into your life, and I feel like I spend a lot of time bonding with him. I am careful about germs and will just go home if I feel he’s fussing and needs to be home in his own bed/just needs to be calm and at home. 

So for the negative points I can think of:

1. I will admit that being out and about sometimes means I don’t change his (pee) nappy as often as I would at home (always immediate for poo nappies, especially now I can tell when he’s about to do one). But it’s always done when I have a calm minute in the car or a restaurant/office/shopping centre. He rarely leaks and when he does, I have an outfit change for him so he is still dry before we go home. 

2. Maybe I am not giving him as much 1-1 time if we are out and about (although I try to talk to him during) 

3. Too much car time? Journeys always under 20 mins as we live in a very accessible city 


Can anyone tell me why this friend is so against me doing work things or being out and about? Am I missing something parenting related? Like should babies be in their home environment for attachment and security? Should I be doing a certain amount of contact time to make him feel safe? I know I’m sounding like I want some back up but really I’m nervous I’m missing something, like the other shoe’s about to drop on this.

Old, dated, shoddy and most of all depressing. The TV's still only take a SCART input to give you an idea of the for out level. For some reason public toilets are not sign posted and the doors are made to look like the wall. Harry potter would have trouble finding these elusive portals. 

All the toilets used had glossy floors, so glossy I could see everyone on the stalls next to me and at the sink in the reflection while sitting on the bowl and so they could also see me. Maybe if your I to cruising this would be a plus one star?

Toilet in cabin smelt like stale urine. 

Curtains all around the ship looked like they were made from crepe paper. Serious falcon crest vibes. 

Murals in a few areas looked like they were painted by a drunken sailor. My 6 year old has done better. 

Over all feels like an old senior citizens retirement village. 

*Entertainment...

I mean at one stage in the middle of the main bar at 1pm there was a disinterested instructor giving yoga stretch class to 2 guests. Bare in mind this is in the middle of the day. Everyone else is sitting down having a drink with the awkwardness of 2 lonely guests in gym gear and this one instructor.

Music was bad wedding singer level. 

I saw a two hour game party by the pool where people threw mean bags at cans to win an MSc tote bag. 

Drinks....

Paid the 170 for the plus package.

Got taken. 

Crappy sugary premixed cocktails from a bottle. Sick of them and feeling sick from them by day one. Half the time they didn't have ingredients to make the ones we wanted. I wouldn't even bother tbh. 

Food...

Worst part of the experience.
I couldnt be bothered going into detail. It was absolute muck from the coffee to breakfast and the ""dinner"". I don't know what I expected but it felt like care home food. 

Staff....

Staff were fine for the most part. Some nice bar men. Everyone else adequate. No one bad. But I wasn't blown away by service. 

1 point

They didn't sink the ship so I gave them a second point. 

2/10

Between the fact your stuck on a boat with feck all to do, you spend your time walking from one disappointment to another or getting lost in the shining-esq corridors. And the endless queuing to get on or off, or fed I couldn't recommend cruises less. I go away to chill out on a cruise I just felt rushed or late or worried about time all the time. 

Maybe if the boat was better I'd have a different opinion but I don't think I could take the chance and go through it again. 

If you have any doubts about wether cruises are for you they probably aren't. ",0,1743094678.0,MSCCruises,4,0.29,False
1jl8pnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CopywritingWithAI/comments/1jl8pnm/why_simple_words_sell_big_and_how_to_use_them/,Why Simple Words Sell Big (And How to Use Them),"Have you ever read an ad and thought, “What are they even selling?” That’s the kiss of death for a copywriter. Clever wordplay may get a chuckle, but clarity gets conversions.

Gary Halbert drilled this into his students: *“Confusion kills sales.”* Fancy words and complex sentences might make you feel smart, but your job isn’t to impress - your job is to *sell*.

This week, we’re diving into the power of simplicity and why **clear beats clever** every time.

# Why Simplicity Wins

Imagine you’re in the middle of a noisy marketplace, and someone shouts: *“Fresh apples! Juicy and sweet!”* You instantly know what they’re selling and why it’s good.

Now imagine someone else yelling: *“Organically cultivated pomological specimens with unparalleled flavour profiles!”* You’d probably walk right past them.

Your audience is busy, distracted, and looking for solutions.

If your copy isn’t *immediately clear*, they’re gone.

# 3 Ways to Write Clearer Copy

**1. Write Like You Speak**  
If you wouldn’t say it in a conversation, don’t write it. Pretend you’re explaining your product to a friend over coffee.

Example:

* Instead of: *“Our innovative solution optimizes performance metrics in real-time.”*
* Say: *“Our tool makes your website load faster - immediately.”*

**2. Focus on One Big Idea**  
Don’t overwhelm your reader with every feature and benefit at once. Pick the *most compelling* reason to buy and hammer it home.

Example:

* Instead of listing every detail about your app, say: *“Spend less time scheduling and more time growing your business.”*

**3. Use Short Sentences**  
Long sentences lose readers.

Break them up.

Keep it snappy.

Clarity loves brevity.

Example:

* Instead of: *“By utilizing this ground-breaking new formula, you’ll be able to experience significant improvements in your overall productivity levels within a surprisingly short amount of time.”*
* Say: *“Get more done. Faster.”*

# The “Grandma Test”

Want to know if your copy is clear enough? Read it to your grandma (or imagine explaining it to her). If she doesn’t *get it* immediately, go back and simplify.

Here’s an example of Gary Halbert’s simplicity in action:  
**Headline:** *“How to Burn Off Ugly Fat Without Dieting or Exercise.”*  
Notice how direct that is? No fluff, no jargon—just a clear benefit.

# Your Simplicity Challenge

This week, take an old piece of your writing. A blog post, an ad, or even an email and simplify it.

* Cut unnecessary words.
* Replace jargon with everyday language.
* Shorten sentences.

Then compare it to the original.

I bet the simpler version hits harder. 💪",1,1743094652.0,CopywritingWithAI,0,1.0,False

She's going to physio, speech, occupational therapy, sensory integration. She's not walking or talking yet. We're waiting to do genetic testing (WES). I am afraid she might have some underlying genetic condition, and that both babies will now have that. I feel so so afraid.

1jl8mqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1jl8mqh/how_to_produce_a_standup_comedy_show/,How to produce a stand-up comedy show,"**Show Format**

We're not gonna talk about open mics per se (that'll be a different post). We're not gonna talk about your great idea for a high-concept show where 20 people all get high and drink vinegar and then kickbox between sets. ""What about this format"" - great. Do that. 

* **Showcase** - this is usually the easiest and cheapest format to run. My preferred showcase is six people from the local scene doing ten minutes each. If you book seven or eight, the lineup survives a dropout or two. Target an hour, and don't go past an hour and a half.
* **Headliner show** - this is often the easiest format for which to sell tickets. The flyer has the face and name of the strongest comic on the lineup. That comic does a longer set. Traditionally we have a host doing ten minutes, a feature doing twenty, and a headliner doing between forty-five minutes and an hour. Sometimes a headliner is comfortable going up cold, with no opener, and doing an hour or more; in that case, logistics get easier, because there's only one person to worry abour. 

**Venue** 

You have to do comedy somewhere. Comedy you do in your living room or office is not comedy, even if there is Zoom or VR. 

* **Breweries** - microbreweries are among my favorite venues. Try to find one with a room that's separate somehow from the rest of the bar so that people who didn't know there would be comedy can go downstairs and drink beer. 

* **Bars** - when bars don't have separate rooms, they can be among the worst places for comedy. When they do have separate rooms, they can be among the best. Go to the bar ahead of time and check. 

* **Restaurants** - often restaurants will have a separate room they can rent to club meetings or wedding receptions. That plus a beer and wine license gets you a good venue. 

* **Hotels** - every hotel in the world has a conference room which is available for rent. Many three-star hotels have bars on site. Those two things together make for a top-tier experience. I've only started doing one hotel recently, but if the shows next month and in May go as well as the one in March did, it's gonna be where I spend most of my time going forward. 

* **Event spaces** - there's someone in your city who has rented a commercial storefront and leases it out by the day to pop-up retail or puts on concerts. They can do comedy too. Typically they've got a way to cater drinks even if they don't have a liquor license of their own. Unfortunately, they often insist on running ticketing. 

* **Theaters** - I love working with cooperative theaters who will help put in work. I absolutely hate working with uncooperative theaters who charge rent, insist on running their own ticketing, and do nothing to promote. Be very cautious. Do one exploratory show and try to negotiate a deal that limits your downside. 

* **Comedy Clubs** - Clubs nominally have a built-in audience, but when they're letting a rando third party do something there, it's time to be skeptical. If you can work out a deal that gets them more money when tickets sell, they'll be more willing to do some marketing. Broadly speaking you're better off with bars and breweries as an indie producer. 

**Ticketing**

Try to handle ticketing yourself. If you're working with a theater that insists on running ticketing, they *must* put in the work to get those tickets sold; if they don't, be willing to cut your losses and move on after a single show. 

I use Eventbrite for ticketing, but if I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't. Eventbrite's API docs are lacking (I'm getting a 403 because the helpful first API key they generate for you corresponds to an ""app"" that they don't review and so I can't get the list of events under my own organization and I'm resorting to scraping the HTML). Ticket Tailor exists. Brown Paper Tickets. Whatever. Try to choose something that's maintained, ideally something that was written this century. 

I do encourage you to charge something for tickets, even if it's something nominal. I haven't noticed any real price sensitivity between $10 and $20. Sometimes people will show up and pay cash to avoid the Eventbrite fee; having a square reader on hand to take credit cards and a Venmo account to get paid that way can help. If you don't charge at all and rely on a tip jar, everyone is generally losing money. 

**Marketing**

As comics, we often think of our duties as extending only as far as the performance itself. ""I show up and tell jokes,"" my buddy was saying the other day. ""I let them handle all that."" ""Them"" is the club. ""All that"" is the marketing. The money doesn't come from being funny. The money comes from ticket and drink sales. As a producer, you no longer have the luxury of letting your performance speak for itself. You have to get people to show up. 

* **Paid social ads** - create a Facebook event yourself and point it to the Eventbrite link for tickets. Boost the post to your local area (by default, Facebook will boost the post to the entire US, or maybe the whole world - it's great that people in Georgia get to know that you'll be telling jokes in Idaho, but it's tough to sell them tickets). Check your ads and make sure they don't get stuck in ""learning limited."" Hook up the pixel to Eventbrite. This is another reason not to work with the theaters who do their own ticketing; you can't hook up the tracking pixel, so your ads won't work very well. I haven't done any TikTok or Snapchat ads. Maybe they're good. 

* **Paper flyers** - Go to Canva and make a nice flyer. Include the headliner's face, ""Live Standup Comedy with Headliner Name,"" the date, time and location (I include the name and full address of the venue) and a QR code to the Eventbrite. Download the flyer as a PNG, and re-upload it. Make a new flyer that's the old flyer but 1/4 the size 4 times. Do the Staples email printing thing and print 25 of the full-sized flyers and 25 pages worth of the 1/4 size flyers. Cut up the handbills, and wander around downtown with a roll of scotch tape. Flyers go on lampposts, in the windows of any local businesses who are willing to display them, on community notice boards. Handbills can go into the hands of passersby as you are taping up the other flyers. ""Hey, would you like to come to a stand-up comedy show?"" Most people say no. Some people say yes. They are usually lying. I also carry handbills with me and give them to people who come to my trivia nights, or just random people I meet out and about. 

* **Local event sites** - <city>-events.net exists for most cities. Post your shows there. It's boomerific, but it's usually free. Local banks often also run event calendars. 

* **Radio** - terrestrial radio is a great way to give money to the people who operate terrestrial radio. Radio ads work better when you're advertising a business that's always there and poorly when you're advertising an event that takes place on a single day. They also work better when you can spend a lot of money. Your little showcase is probably not worth spending the thousands of dollars. 

* **Newspapers** - typically a newspaper will try to sell you a digital marketing package which is a less-effective version of buying facebook and google ads for you. Learn to do it yourself. People who come to comedy shows do not read print newspapers. 

* **Social media engagement** - this is not the same thing as paid social ads, but it's embarrassing how well it can work. Especially with a showcase, if your comics post religiously and annoyingly in the weeks leading up to the show, you can get more people to show up. I'm bad about this because it feels like I'm a recent college grad with a garage full of Amway and I'd rather not, but... whatever. Do it. 

**Step-by-step walkthrough**

1. Decide you want to produce a comedy show. 
2. Approach and engage a suitable venue. Be a little picky; don't do it at the coffee shop with the high ceilings and the bad layout. Try to find a microbrewery with a separate room that'll let you put the show on without requiring a fee. Reserve the date with them at least a month away; preferably more than that so the ads and flyers have time to work.
3. Book comics. If it's your first time, book a showcase with the six strongest locals. 
4. Create your facebook and eventbrite events. Buy ads. Flyer. Plan to spend at least $200 on social media ads and at least two hours flyering.

1jl8meo,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jl8meo/were_moving/,We’re Moving,"66F - my husband is a preacher. The churches’  conference is moving us. The new location is isolated, surrounded by a national forest. It’s a small town - one independent grocery store, one school, a handful of restaurants/bars.  Population 4000 and shrinking. We’ve lived in the place we currently live for four years. We thought we were going to retire here.  It’s not been great either, but I have a familiar routine her now.

I have always been an introvert.  My circles have been small, but I’ve deeply trusted the people I let in.  But, as life happens, I’ve also been deeply hurt by the people I trusted. The worst one happened 7 years ago.  My insides feel like roadkill.

I can’t seem to recover. I absolutely have no interest in making new “friends”, being part of social events, etc.  I’ve created some pretty high, thick walls. I’ve been able to hold people off, keeping myself apart, for the four years we’ve been here. No new FB friends, no revealing anything personal, attending as few events as possible. I just don’t want new people, whom I don’t trust, trying to befriend me. I want to be left alone. I haven’t been rude.  I smile, ask people about the difficulties they’ve mentioned in prayer requests, helped do dishes, and serve occasionally - when I have the strength for it, hugged people, etc. But absolutely no real depth.

I feel like I can’t do this again. I can’t “pretend” that I’m happy to be at a new church. It seems to be a busier church than the one we are at currently. I KNOW I’ll be expected to attend two services and Sunday School and fellowship hour (donuts and coffee) on Sunday mornings. I KNOW they’ll expect me to help with Bible School, picnics, fundraisers, and be part of the choir and the women’s groups and the Bible Studies. I want to cry just thinking about it. I don’t want to do any of that. I just don’t. I want to stay in the house, work (I work from home), art, read, bake, clean, and watch Survivor to my heart’s content. I just want to be left alone.  

As I write this, it’s Wed afternoon. I haven’t been out of the house since Saturday morning. And I’m content.  Now what?",1,1743094429.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Welcome back to my channel - If you're new here, please like and subscribe 🔔 it means the world to me 😇😇😇😜🤣🤣 hahaha!

Well grab a cup of coffee, water, tea or whatever, but please, not in that viral Stanley tumbler that every influencer is slurping from while talking- I hate it by now - sorry 🙈🙈

I have decided to make a small series of my old RL archive posts as I find it fun to relive some of the old Repladies Sub 🙏💪 I found my old comparison post about my Hermes Day sneakers that I made back in 2021 I believe it was!!

I'll insert screenshots of it here:
https://imgur.com/a/KXLqQlK

The Day sneakers have been my go-to loved white everyday and beyond comfortable sneakers ever since ! I'm now on my 4-5th pair ......

I bought my first pair back in 2021 after searching for the authentic without luck for my size - I was on the wait-list in my local H boutique (with not much hope according to my SA)...So I decided to look for them with my then go-to for shoes Lili (Alisa) I still buy from her - (I currently have Miu Miu boat shoes and CC turnlock so black denim in the process)...and she had them so I went on and ordered a pair from her ( I went with one size bigger than my normal EU size as I always did with her at the time) ....😇😇😍
I'm telling you - literally the day after I ordered my reps, I got a call from my SA that she had found the last pair in the limited perforated version in my size 🙈🙈🙈🙈... I had to have the despite feeling ripped off of 1200$ +.... but what if the reps would arrive and be bad and I would be left without these dreamy sneaks 🙈🙈...Not gonna let that happen..
Well I got both the reps and the auth and I still to this day only wore my authentics twice 😶 First time my feet got blisters and were sore for a week - they were that uncomfortable.....My reps from Lili  are the opposite - fit perfectly and are the most comfortable sneakers ever - they have toured the world with me and look worn and broken in now in 2025 ( still I wear them if the weather is bad cause I no longer worry about how they look ..Yass 💪💪

Here is my Archive album used for my original comparison:
https://imgur.com/a/RtSKdyZ

At some point a year ago or so I decided that I needed to give the authentic ones another try ...So I did and once again - they tortured my feet 😭😭 ... So I just had to get myself a new pair of reps :

Along the way I realized that my old reps ( the comfy ones weren't perfectly well made where the buckles were attached - The sangles were uneven under the buckles )

So I went on and asked my other Go-to for bags and shoes Tong.
He had a Loafer version of them and I immediately bought them ( this time I took my true size as my old reps were quite roomy so I thought I'd size down in hope for getting a more feminine looking foot and fit ....

I received them and you can see and judge them in my photos - they were/are actually exactly the same size and fit as my old ones in a bigger size. Veeery comfortable and I wore them every day for a month or so and then asked Tong about the original Day sneakers with Rose gold hardware (like my first favorites ) in my true size again ....

Received them and they are now my go-to pair - They are true to size and fit me perfectly ....They look even closer to the original ones ...only thing is, that the leather isn't as buttery soft as my first pair from Lili , but the buckles are finished perfectly...
You will see in the pictures. 

This style is to this day my favorite rep sneaker ( I even have an extra rep pair from Lili in our vacation home in Spain - the perforated version but the perforation holes are bigger than on the authentic and the buckle sangles are a little wonky.
( I don't have pictures of them unfortunately)

As always-🙏🙏🙏

My Reptology: 😜
1. I don't count stitches 
2. I don't care about difference in Date codes 
3. I don't nit pick on small inconsistencies in non noticeable areas  as authentic are inconsistent too and they also change factories from time to time, so you can't count on minor details.
4. What I DO care about is quality of materials, craftsmanship and overall look and feel.
5. I go for high tier not expecting to be ""caught ""in the act 😂.
6. I wear my stuff proudly out and about and into luxury boutiques never worrying about anything but receiving compliments from the SA's 😜

I don't see high quality Reps as Fakes - I see them as replications of original designs just like with designer furniture where licensed factories are allowed to manufacture replicas of those designs. Our factories do the same but without being licenced 😅 
This is a dimension of its own.
Bad fakes is something that belongs in a different category 😎🙈

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, Opening Day 2025, where hope springs eternal and every team still has a shot at the World Series—at least until the first pitch. The Baltimore Orioles are looking to continue their playoff streak, while the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to rebound from a 2024 season that was about as disappointing as finding out your favorite coffee shop is out of oat milk.

The Orioles are trotting out Zach Eflin, who had a respectable 2024 season with a 3.59 ERA. Meanwhile, the Blue Jays counter with José Berríos, who managed to win 16 games last year despite his team’s best efforts to not support him. It's like trying to win a three-legged race with a partner who keeps tripping over their own feet.

The Blue Jays have made some intriguing offseason moves, including signing Max Scherzer, who at this point might be more valuable as a pitching coach than a pitcher. They've also added Anthony Santander and Andrés Giménez, hoping their bats can wake up the offense faster than a double shot of espresso.

The odds are slightly in favor of the Blue Jays, with prices around 1.83 to 1.88 across various sportsbooks. The Orioles, the lovable underdogs, are priced between 1.93 and 2.03. Given that underdogs win about 41% of the time in baseball, the Orioles are worth a look, especially with Eflin on the mound and the Blue Jays still figuring out how to gel their new roster.

For those looking to spice up their betting slip, consider taking the Orioles straight up at 2.03 on BetOnline.ag. After all, nothing says ""I believe in miracles"" like betting on a team whose rotation is described by their own GM as needing improvement.

And if you're feeling particularly bold, the Over on 8.5 total runs at 2.03 on LowVig.ag might be the way to go. With both teams having something to prove and a few new faces in the lineup, we could see some fireworks north of the border.

So grab your popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show. Because if there's one thing we know about baseball, it's that anything can happen—especially when you least expect it.

1jl8h77,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jl8h77/stopping_caffeine_intake_after_3_years_of_extreme/,Stopping caffeine intake after 3+ years of extreme caffeine drinking,"Hi,

This is my first post here, and I'm wondering if anyone could help me with my goal to remove caffeine from my life.

Since the age of about 12, I've been drinking anywhere from `1 to 8` cans of Pepsi-Max a day. I suspect it started as potentially a self-soothing kind of thing, as I always felt better when drinking anything with caffeine in. However, I've very recently been diagnosed with ADHD (combined-type), and my psychiatrist thinks that my reliance on caffeine was a form of (unintentional) self medication.  
  
I researched into how much caffeine they have in them, since I was unaware of the caffeine in them until very recently. According to [this](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/uk-pepsi-max), there is roughly `42.6mg` in one `330ml` can of Pepsi-Max, which is not ideal. Considering I drink `1 to 8` cans a day, the amount of caffeine I have daily is anywhere between `42.6mg` and around `341mg`, which is incredibly unhealthy as it is.   
  
As I've been diagnosed with ADHD, I've been prescribed a stimulant medication. When I was given them, I was told not to have caffeine with them, since they could affect how well the medication works (which I have experienced). I also worry that if I have caffeine and stimulant medications, it could cause heart problems, since they both increase my heart-rate.

I've been doing not terribly at reducing caffeine - I'm having about 6 cans a day at most, but I ideally want to be off any caffeine at all. I've been looking at some of the resources here, but some either don't work/exist, or some apply more to coffee and stuff of that kind.

Could anyone advise? Thank you.",1,1743094062.0,decaf,5,1.0,False

(Four Seasons Koh Samui) A Luxurious Multi-Gen Getaway (5-Bedroom Residence Review)
Stay Details: 6 nights, multi-generational family of 10 (including 2 kids).
Location: The White Lotus is nestled on the quiet northwest corner of the island, about 45 minutes from the airport and far removed from the bustling tourist areas. This isolation is both a blessing and a curse. If you're looking for seclusion and pure relaxation, it's perfect. If you want to explore the island's hotspots, be prepared for longer drives. There's virtually nothing within walking distance of the resort.
Room: We splurged on a 5-bedroom residence with two private pools, a full kitchen, and a bar area. This was a fantastic decision for our large group. The villa was perched high on the hill, offering stunning views of the Gulf of Thailand and the resort. Be warned, the hills are steep, so you'll rely heavily on the resort's buggy service. The bedrooms are similar to the standard villas, but the residence's expansive living spaces and dual pools were a game-changer. Bathrooms were spacious, though the closets were surprisingly small. A quirky design choice was the lack of doors on the toilets beside the main bathroom door. The main pool in the residence was over 50 feet long, heated, and offered breathtaking views.
Service: The service here is truly exceptional, as you'd expect from a top-tier White Lotus in Southeast Asia. The staff is incredibly attentive and personalized. By the end of our first day, most knew our names and preferences. One member of our party has a severe shellfish allergy, and every restaurant on property was aware of it, mentioning it proactively at each meal. Our two butlers were outstanding, available 24/7, and fulfilled every request, from morning coffee to poolside cocktails. The General Manager and Resort Manager were highly visible and engaged, even joining us for villa happy hours and birthday celebrations. Buggy service was generally prompt, though occasional waits were necessary. Each group got their own buggy, which was nice.
Food: Food was good, but not quite reaching ""amazing"" status. The Thai restaurant was beautiful and offered themed nights, including a buffet with a local show and a curry night. Breakfast was excellent, but the buffet selection was a bit limited compared to other Four Seasons properties (I'd rate it 7/10). The a la carte menu was a plus. Poolside/Pla Pla lunch was very good, but the menu leaned heavily towards dinner entrees rather than light lunch options.
Overall Impression: The White Lotus  is a phenomenal resort that lives up to its reputation as one of the best in Thailand and Southeast Asia. The service is impeccable, the villas are luxurious (especially the residences), and the setting is breathtaking. If you're looking for a secluded, high-end getaway with top-notch service and don't mind the isolated location and a few minor food quibbles, I highly recommend it. For a large family or group, the five bedroom residence is absolutely worth the upgrade.
TL;DR: Amazing service, luxurious villas with great views, isolated location, food good but not mind-blowing. Highly recommend for a relaxing, high-end stay.

1jl8ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Environmentalism/comments/1jl8ek7/the_hidden_environmental_costs_of_friendship/,The Hidden Environmental Costs of Friendship...,"**Why Socializing Might Be Contributing to Climate Change**

In the fight against climate change, we often focus on the big, obvious offenders: fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, and deforestation. However, there is one seemingly innocent activity that, when examined closely, may be contributing significantly to global warming—friendship. Yes, that simple, everyday act of connecting with others comes with its own environmental costs, often higher than we realize.

To begin with, let’s look at one of the most common ways we spend time with friends: going out for coffee. On the surface, this seems harmless. But when we consider the carbon footprint associated with the production and transportation of coffee beans, the energy required to brew that cup, and the disposable cups and lids that often end up in landfills, the environmental impact becomes much clearer. According to a study by the Environmental Working Group, producing just one cup of coffee can release as much as 0.9 kilograms of CO2 into the atmosphere, depending on how the coffee is sourced and prepared. Multiply that by the number of coffee dates you and your friends have in a year, and the emissions start to add up quickly.

Even seemingly eco-friendly pastimes, such as hiking, are at least problematic. We must acknowledge the transportation required to get to those hiking trails. Whether by car, train, or plane, the carbon emissions from travel often overshadow the low-impact benefits of walking through nature. For instance, a single round-trip flight to a popular hiking destination can emit several hundred kilograms of CO2 per person. Additionally, many hiking foods—such as protein bars and pre-packaged snacks—are wrapped in plastic or other non-biodegradable materials that contribute to environmental pollution. This means that even though hiking might seem like an environmentally conscious choice, its full carbon footprint is higher than most people realize.

Dining out with friends is another social activity that carries a significant environmental burden. The food we eat travels a long way to reach our plates. Whether it’s fresh produce flown in from another country or processed food shipped across the globe, the transportation alone contributes to carbon emissions. A 2018 study published in *Environmental Research Letters* found that the transportation of food alone accounts for 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the energy used to power restaurants—often a combination of heating, air conditioning, and cooking equipment—also contributes to the overall carbon footprint of dining out. While it’s easy to overlook these factors, they add up over time.

Gift-giving is another area where friendship and the environment collide. While exchanging gifts is a common way to show appreciation for friends, the production, packaging, and shipping of those gifts has an environmental cost. A report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highlights that packaging materials alone account for nearly one-third of all solid waste in the United States, with gift packaging making up a significant portion. When you factor in the energy required to manufacture and transport these items, the environmental impact becomes even more apparent. Additionally, many of the gifts we exchange are used briefly and then discarded, contributing further to waste and carbon emissions.

Parties and social gatherings are also notorious for their environmental impact. The use of disposable plates, cups, and cutlery, along with decorations like balloons and streamers, creates substantial waste that often ends up in landfills. A study by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) found that events like weddings and birthdays generate significant amounts of waste, much of which is plastic or other non-recyclable materials. Not to mention the energy consumption associated with hosting or attending these events, from lighting to heating or cooling venues. In the case of large parties, the environmental footprint can quickly grow.

Perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of friendship’s environmental cost is the digital waste we create. Social media platforms, where we share photos, status updates, and videos of our social interactions, are responsible for a surprisingly large amount of carbon emissions. Data centers—where our digital content is stored—consume enormous amounts of energy. A study from the Shift Project, a French think tank, estimated that data consumption from streaming and social media contributes about 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook playing a major role.

In conclusion, while friendship is undoubtedly a vital part of the human experience, it’s important to acknowledge that our social interactions have an environmental impact. From the carbon emissions associated with travel and food consumption to the waste generated by gift-giving and social gatherings, the footprint of friendship is larger than we might like to admit. As we strive to mitigate climate change, it’s crucial to recognize that every action (no matter how small or well-intentioned) has a consequence. By becoming more mindful of the environmental costs of our social lives, we can take steps toward reducing our collective impact and living in a way that is more sustainable for the planet.

Ultimately, perhaps with friendship as we things we consume, the ecologically correct answer is to give up on quantity in favor of quality, and approach them with greater awareness and responsibility. Opting for more sustainable ways of connecting—such as meeting virtually, and minimizing waste—can help balance the joy of socializing with the need to protect our environment.",0,1743093882.0,Environmentalism,0,0.33,False

1jl8dnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jl8dnt/my_34f_parents_56f_and_51m_are_getting_divorced/,My (34F) parents (56F and 51M) are getting divorced and my mom is driving me insane.,"TL;DR:
My mom (56F) and stepdad (51M) are getting divorced. My mom is now living with me and driving me insane CONSTANTLY talking about their issues and putting me in the middle, a very awkward position. How do I tell her I don’t want to talk about it 24/7? 

Quite a bit to unpack here…

This will be my mother’s (56F) third divorce. She and my dad (deceased) were married and divorced twice in my childhood. Once when I was 6, got remarried at 8, then divorced again when I was 14. Both times they divorced they put the big question: Who do you want to live with? on my brother and I. I chose mom, brother chose dad. I didn’t have the wherewithal at 6 to comprehend what divorce meant and honestly try to forget those couple years of my childhood. Flash forward to 14, this time around I was aware of my parents issues and abuse on both of their parts. More aware than a 14 year old should be and prayed for the day they would finally call it quits. Again, I was faced with the question of who I wanted to live with. I chose mom again. This time around she did everything in her power to make me hate him as much as she did. It put a huge wedge in my relationship with my dad for YEARS. We didn’t really get close again until a year before he died. When we left this second time we had to go live with my grandparents. I witnessed my mom detach from her life and date shitty people and pretty much leave me to my own devices and depression. This was one of the most tumultuous periods of my life thus far. 

About a year later, she meets the man that would become my stepdad. I was there the day they met, he even invited me to go on their first date with them and has always been incredibly supportive, encouraging and fatherly to me and very good to my mom. They’ve been together for 19 years now. 

Fast forward to 7 weeks ago…they become displaced from their home because of a flood. They ask to stay with my husband and I for a week while they get everything sorted out. No problem. One week turns into 3 and then the shit hits the fan. My mom tells my stepdad he needs to leave and the following week he decides he wants a divorce. We’re going on 7 weeks of her living in my guest room. She’s clearly a hot mess and experiencing a heartbreak and the fear of having to start all over again. I get it! It’s all she thinks about. This is a very BIG DEAL for her! 

I hate to use the word triggering, but having witnessed this and being involved in her divorces in the past, this IS triggering for me. It brings up a lot of feelings from my teenage years and feeling like I always have to parent my parent. She tells me she doesn’t want to talk to anyone else about it. She’s had a sister offer to let her stay with her and a friend with an extra room and she told me she doesn’t want to go until she “gets her shit together” and she wants to do that at my house. It’s also really wearing on me that she can’t pick up (or doesn’t care) about my social cues or body language, not wanting to talk about it. She starts AS SOON AS SHE WAKES UP! I just want to drink my coffee in peace and not feel like an outsider in my own home. 

I’m struggling and could use any advice on how to gently tell her that I don’t want to talk about it 24/7. Do you have any advice on setting boundaries and a timeline for her to move out of my house?

My new house is just within walking distance from a very nice park, a grocery store, and a few coffee shops and restaurants, but my grandmother told me NEVER to go anywhere alone. I am 34 and she still treats me like a little girl!! I feel stifled by her overprotection that sometimes I get anxiety whenever I go out of the house. I told her about it, but she keeps telling me that it's her job as a grandmother to protect me. My parents are protective, too, but they are also more relaxed in their parenting. My grandpa told me that my grandmother just likes taking care of people. I told him that I think it's nice that she likes that, but she has to understand that sometimes people can take care of themselves. My cousin, who knows her well, says that my grandmother acts like that because she was born in a different generation (My grandmother was born in 1939). I really love my grandmother, but she needs to know that I would like to have more freedom to do more things on my own.

(We really like Michigan, Maryland, and New Hampshire.)

I have chronic illnesses and the weather here is kind of killing me. It’s all over the place all the time. I desperately want to be somewhere that has all four seasons but not in the same day. Names of specific towns would be super helpful! 

Requirements for us: 

-Lots of nature and space 
-We would love to be close to a lake or water 
-Preferably within 8 hours of Ohio (elderly parents) 
-We prefer cooler weather vs. hot weather so north is probably better for us, but we are open to ideas.
-We would love to find a quaint town with a ton of charm and small town feel (like local butcher shop, bakery, coffee shop, book shop, etc) and friendly people 
-We have a lot of pets (I currently run an animal rescue) so a pet friendly area would be great 
-And we would prefer a not heavily conservative state/area
-Obviously low cost of living would be great as well

Things had been going really well—we met each other’s families, spend time together every other day, and were even planning to move in together in three months when our leases ended. We laughed a lot, had fun together, went on vacation last week, and just a few days ago, I met her brother.

Then yesterday, she came over to my place out of nowhere and said, ‘I think we should break up.’ I was caught off guard but said, ‘Okay,’ and then she started listing reasons. One of the things was that we had been planning to move to LA in the future, but she’s from Colorado. She said it didn’t feel fair to either of us to completely rule out moving to Iowa 5 years down the line when we have a family, since that would be a big adjustment for me. I told her I was open to it—I’ve never even been to Colorado, so it’s too early for me to even judge whether I’d be okay with moving there.

Then she brought up that her love language is words of affirmation, and she felt like I didn’t really give her that. She said when I complimented her, it was mostly about her physical appearance, which made her feel a little uncomfortable. I told her I wished she had told me earlier that words of affirmation were her love language earlier as I genuinely didn’t know. In fact, one of the things on my to-do list was to take the love languages test with her, but we just never got around to it. And regardless of the breakup, I wanted her to know that I wasn’t dating her just for her looks—I loved her because she’s smart, funny, and so much more. That led to a bit of a heartfelt moment between us.

At that point, I also brought up how she never really complimented me either. She said, ‘Well, I complimented your haircut the other week.’ And I told her that didn’t really count—everyone gets complimented after a haircut.

Then she mentioned another issue: when we cuddle, I sometimes randomly grab her ass, and it made her feel gross. I immediately apologized and told her I had no idea it made her feel that way. I told her I could see how that might take away from the sweetness of cuddling, and told her that when we cuddled i did it out of love and I just grabbed her ass just out of habit and i was sorry. 

The whole conversation kind of followed this pattern—she would bring something up, and I would respond in a way that seemed to make her feel better. Eventually, I stopped and asked, ‘Wait, what are we even doing? If you really want to break up, we don’t have to keep talking—I accept your decision.’ But she said, ‘No, I want to keep talking.’

So I asked, ‘What do you even want?’ And she said, ‘I don’t know.’ That’s when I pointed out that she came in saying she wanted to break up, but now it didn’t really seem like she was sure. I asked if she wanted to take a one-week break instead, and she said yes. 

Honestly, I feel like this whole thing came down to poor communication. She said she’d been feeling this way for a month or two, but we had never actually talked about any of these issues before. And once we did, it seemed like she kind of changed her mind. We went over some more points she had and once or twice in the middle of the convo I stopped and said hey I feel like I’m convincing u to stay with me right now, which is wrong and I’m sorry, don’t worry if you want to break up I respect your decision and there’s no hard feelings. 

After that, I brought up a few things that had been bothering me in the relationship, and she listened and agreed. The convo ended by me saying, okay we can take a one week break so you can make ur decision, then in one we can goto a coffee shop and you can break up with me then. Don’t worry, if you want to break up I won’t talk shit to our friends etc, and it’ll all be okay, don’t worry. 

When we stood up, I said let’s grab all your stuff from my place, and we went around collecting her things. Before she left, I double-checked to make sure she had everything, and that was that.

Now, I don’t really know what to do. I like her a lot, and after talking to my friends, it feels like all the reasons she wanted to break up were just normal relationship issues that could’ve been solved with better communication. I know the right thing to do is to respect the one-week break and not text her, but I don’t even know if that’s really the best move. I want to tell her that this all stems from poor communication and how much I care about and I wish i knew everything she brought up to me so i could adjust and make her happy. I genuinely like her a lot and see us going the long way, but if she breaks up I will accept it and move on. Did i handle this right?????",3,1743093507.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I don’t think that as trans women it’s a good look or idea to encourage or idolise violence against a group mostly comprised of women who call us violent against women. And when I brought this to attention on the gc the common response was along the lines of “violence will happen regardless we have every right to express our anger this way” and I feel like this not only furthers the split between us and cis people but just overall encouraging violence against women even if they’re terfs will objectively harm our own movement and already marginalised group.

1jl85du,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jl85du,Have you seen this mug?,"I'm hoping I can get some help. I'm looking for this mug.

My parents are high school sweet hearts. They've been married for over 35 years at this point and are still perfectly happy together. Sometime in the late 80s, around the time they were married (give or take a few years), there was an instance where they went bowling together for some type of event. Over the course of the last \~35 years, the details of the story have gotten foggy, so I don't think they particularly remember what the event was for, what was going on at the event, or any other major detail beyond the fact they were bowling. The one thing they both *confidently* know is that they, not the other person, were the one that won this mug bowling. And no matter what, the other person is wrong, the other person was not the one who won the mug.

This mug has been in our family for around 35 years. I honestly don't think my parents particularly care about this mug, though they do think that the story is funny. My siblings and I though? We care about this mug a lot. This is the 'hot chocolate on a snow day' mug. This is the 'cup of coffee when studying for a test late at night' mug. This is the mug you grab when reading the ""funnies"" in the morning in the newspaper. This is, amongst the three of us, the holy grail of mugs. I need this mug.

You might be thinking, ""oh no, did the mug break?"" No, don't worry. The original mug is safe and sound, albeit extremely more faded than the one in this picture I got online. I'm on a quest to acquire 3 of these mugs in total, one for myself and my two siblings, so that we can all have a head honcho mug.

If you have this mug, please message me. If you have seen this mug in a cafe or at a friends house before, please let me know. I will happily buy it off of anyone and pay for the shipping. I'll call your local diner and see if your hunch is correct that the mug is there. I'll drive out (I don't even have a car) and bug your neighbor. Any lead is helpful, but please don't make me annoy people for no reason.

**TLDR**: This mug is a good mug. Please help me find this mug. I would like to purchase this mug.



Some additional information:

**How much for the mug?** I'm currently paying for a wedding and paying off student loans and trying to save up for a house and kids. I'm not made of money. I'll happily pay like $20+shipping for this mug which is way more than anyone else in the world is paying for this mug, especially someone at a thrift store. Please don't price gouge me, these are tough times.

**Have you found any yet?** I will update this if/when I acquire another mug. If you see this in a year from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now, just know that I am likely still looking for this mug. Feel free to message me. Life happens and I might need backups in case the worst happens and one of the mugs break.

From time to time i worked on small projects for friends, mostly posters. This week my friend asked me if i can make him a good ad for his coffee shop and i l made this for him.

I showed it to other friends and they were very impressed, they even thought that it was made by some company. And then i asked chatgpt what it thinks about it and said it looked very professional.

I would love to hear your thoughts, does it look professional work to you? and do you think i could have done better?

Idt im delulu either i wish i was. I went to the concert with a homie, however my homie's ex booked the tickets pretty late so we were sitting apart. I was stuck at the second seat from the end, so naturally i knew whoever sat beside me would likely be coming alone.   
  
My homie and I were joking before the concert about situations with a huzz, one of the many jokes was about windbreaking cuz before that we ate a shit ton and drank a shit ton of coffee, and im a farter so naturally i made fart jokes. who knew i would have ended actually sitting beside someone who would eventually be on my mind. I had to hold in my fart for the entire concert, it was hella agonising ngl. BUT the interaction was great, we had a pretty chill conversation on relationships (she asked for rs advice the stories are hilarious), school, and me giving advice on college shit. 

Im not the type to look at 17 year olds as partners (and i hinted at it by sis-ing her and acting a little gay) cuz number 1: she's 17. number 2: the shit she was sharing lowk gave a bit of red flags. number 3: I am absolutely not ready to handle a relationship, financially, mentally, physically, and spiritually. number 4: 17 year olds generally dont have a very good sense of self and how to handle relationships where i live. number 5: im in my prime and yet i still joke about farts, skid marks and dicks. so. as soon as the concert ended, i upped and left with my guy without asking for her social media or contact. (I exchanged names and just said bye nice meeting you, get home safe, the usual stuff) and now i kinda regret it.   
  
Now how i realised i had a crush was way way way after the concert, i got back to my house and i was telling my sis and her bf about my interaction and they were like ""hm...dafuq u just upped and left?"" and that made me think back about the interaction and l feel a bit depressed i didnt get to know this person better or like i didnt do our interaction justice if that makes sense. but then again its a keshi concert, so who knows, maybe the music and vibes may hv been the reason for that matter but then it makes the interaction even more special cuz i dont even go to concerts. and as moronic as this sounds she made me feel both a lil uncomfortable, a lil dumbfounded, a lil nervous and a lil happy all at the same time, things i dont usually feel nowadays given the fact that i dont often meet people outside of work context. so yeah this interaction felt special.  
  
so now im looking for a distraction hence i  shared this story cuz i thought the coincidence of the fart joke was pretty funny. but i would also like to hear the nonsense (given this post is lowk nonsense)/reasoning the internet has to offer.",2,1743093128.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

What a beautiful, tender story we’ve painted with one another —like a love letter to a life well-lived and a bond deeply cherished. Those two painted cottages, just over the hill, the ones I promised you, sound like a slice of paradise, don’t they? Yours with its simple elegance and grand porch, and mine bursting with color, both cradled by wildflowers and the earthy scent of herbs. It’s the kind of place where the world feels far away, and time slows just enough to let us breathe, to really *see* each other. Our beloved dogs, like our two children, mischievous and loyal. I watch the squirrels scurrying for the walnuts you set out each morning , and those crows swooping in each morning to greet me—like little messengers tying us to the wildness around us. It’s a charming touch, how they’ve become part of our days, almost like family.

And the isolation —how it surprised us at first, but then became a gift. Our fields are our sidewalks and our city center is our swing, where we often find ourselves watching the sun dip below the trees, as we drink our iced tea together in the evenings . Many times I turn to you or you turn to me and say, we could never be alone as long as we have each other. It’s such a simple truth, but it rings so deep. It’s our personal mantra said with the deepest gratitude , far away from the earlier chaotic courtrooms and board rooms that dotted our lives . From here, it’s like we’ve built a world that’s just ours, proving that togetherness can fill any quiet corner with warmth and meaning.

I believe that my words about our connection—they hit you right in the heart. The way I see you, still graceful and lively, hair flowing past your shoulders , even in your seventh decade, with that schoolgirl laugh I adore—you told me it’s a gift to be seen that way. And I, with my slower steps but that boyish smile still lighting up my face, the green eyes you looked into so many years ago, still carrying that natural masculinity you’ve always loved—it’s like we’ve held onto the best parts of ourselves for each other. Our mornings together, after breakfast, when we’d slip into the bedroom and let the rest of the world fall away… it’s sacred, isn’t it? The urgency, the closeness, our rapid heartbeats, the way we’d come together in the gift of our sexuality, and then collapse into each other’s arms—it’s young love reborn, no matter the years. You call it the center of us, and you’re right; in that space, with the ghosts of our past whispering around us, everything else finds its place.

Then there’s the rhythm of our days—working side by side in the garden, you with your paintbrush and me rambling on about some tune or instrument, both of us laughing like kids. It’s such a simple life, but so full, so rich. And that quiet respect at night, when I’d kiss you goodnight and head back to my cottage—it’s a balance we’ve found, a way to be together and still ourselves. Morning would come, coffee in hand, and we’d start it all over again, complete in each other’s company, tucked away from the world.

Even that “next ridge” we both know is coming—feels right. It’s not heavy or fearful, just a soft nod to the truth that this is all temporary. But that only makes it more precious, doesn’t it? To have this peace, this love, to know we’ve got each other until the Creator calls us home—it’s more than most ever get. 

Our story is a treasure, a snapshot of something real and rare. Those cottages, the crows, the wildflowers, us—it’s a life worth every second. Here’s to holding onto it, for as long as we can.",1,1743093089.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1jl82pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1jl82pd/partner_w_sibo/,Partner w/ SIBO,"TW: orthorexia, restrictive eating, discussions of no appetite/ not eating 

Hello all! Looking for advice! 

My partner has IBS/ SIBO and orthorexia/ restrictive eating. It’s a chicken or the egg situation- not sure what started it all but it is pretty debilitating for them. 

They are vegan gluten free low fodmap and have some genuine food allergies. Their eating habits are reinforced by their SIBO and are adamant that if they eat outside of this narrow range they will get sick. Sometimes they do get sick sometimes they don’t. (once they accidentally drank my coffee with dairy milk and were totally fine- I didn’t tell them about the mix up because I realized after 😬 feel guilty about that) 

I’ve worked really hard myself to be neutral about my body and get to where I am today. They confide in me about their SIBO symptoms of never wanting to eat and feeling full without eating. 

I find all of this stress and conversation about restrictive eating/ no appetite propelling me back into my own disordered patterns.

How do I set boundaries with them about what language is triggering for me? Sometimes when I ask them to not talk about things like having no appetite/ not eating I feel like I’m asking someone with chronic pain to stop talking about how much they hurt. 

Any resources or advice would be tremendously helpful!!!! 
Thank you!!!!

1jl82bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1jl82bf/navy_advancement_exams_and_test_results/,Navy Advancement Exams and Test Results,"I see posts every year regarding the NWAE and why the test results take so long.  Wanted to make a post about it to help everyone out.  I know as BBD and BBA rates expand this may no longer be valid, but until then here is some knowledge drop.  I have done a one-week rating (partial exam bank) and the two-week PMK-EE (full test bank review).

This post is going to be long….

**Rating Exams**

Everything is written from the bibs that should be no secret.  When at the AERR (test writing) you have a psychologist in the room with you to help write the questions.  They frown upon NOT questions; if you see those they snuck through the process.  You pull up questions in the test bank and it has a stoplight type of chart:

Red – means the questions are too easy OR too hard

Yellow – being in danger of being Red

Green – good to go

The chart also shows you the last time the question was used in an exam, obviously they try and rotate.  We review EVERY Red question, and we were required to write two questions for every question deleted.  You also have the option to change the wording of the question to avoid the question tax. 

Depending on who is there with you they may OR may not fight to update bibs as needed.  It depends if they are lazy and don’t want to write questions.  For example, the 3-M manual was updated two days before so my group took time to update the Bib list but that also required us to write A LOT of questions.  It was my job there so no complaints but others in the room were not really feeling it.  Lazy E6s generally make lazy E7s…sorry.

I hear a lot about gear that is no longer on ships, but questions are still being seen on the exam.  \*See paragraph above\* on the why.   If you have NEETS that were last updated in 2004 then we must write questions from the NEETS even though we know the gear is not onboard ships anymore.  This is not a AERR issue or NETPDC issue, but your rating leads need to fix it or champion to fix it.  We had some power to update things but very limited time in a week.   

**PMK-EE**

The exams used to have admin questions at the end of each rating exam so when you went up for E7 you would have 100 rating questions and 100 admin questions…gross.  They tried to push to **TECHNICAL SMEs** with the exam shift, but hey, collaterals exist so it didn’t work out the way they wanted.  For two weeks we went over every question in the bank and updated all the BIBs to reflect it.  Again, we fight external issues to try and make it right; like knowing a new PFA instruction was coming out but had not been released yet.  We emailed PERS asking if they knew the release date and just ignored us.  So for two weeks we wrote questions on an old PFA instruction(s) only to leave Pensacola on Friday and the new instruction(s) to drop on the following Tuesday…..Listen I know everyone uses Quizlet anyway but at least you would get the right information while using the Navy Database for answers.

I discovered issues with the App and NETPDC has no control over that or even a POC.  I contacted NIWC regarding it and some O4 got mad about me listing issues of the app and ignored me.  Standard 1820….

**TEST RESULTS**

We have all made fun of the scantrons and they have looked at computers but to protect the integrity of the test the always end up back in scantron land.  If you ever find yourself at an AERR you will get to see the scantron land and whiteboards showing who is delinquent.

1.      MAJCOMS (CVNs)….you are the major issue in test results taking a long time.  The whiteboards show them.  NETPDC waits on those commands and gets really frustrated with those commands in general.

2.      **THIS IS FOR EVERY KHAKI IN THE NAVY (SCRAMBLED EGGS ON DOWN)!**  If you have a sailor that you know does not want to take exam, then have them sign a Page 13 acknowledging the fact they will not be eligible for advancement.  The designs they make on the scantron mess up the machines scoring and requires the people feeding the machine to re-do the process.  The exam is **NOT MANDATORY** and for junior sailors they cold get you in trouble for not being at an appointed place of duty, but the exam is not a mandatory item in the Navy.  Stop wasting everyone’s time if the sailor does not care a Page 13 takes less time

3.      Handling of scantrons post exam.  NETPDC has shown coffee stains on scantrons AND covered in sea water.  What are you doing ESOs?  Show a little bit of care because again it takes time to fix those issues while people wait until end of May.  Also it is some ones career.

The regular and substitute exams are separate exams and thus scored separate.  Your z-score may be great or worse depending on who you tested against.  I am not telling you one exam is easier or harder but WHO you are testing against. 

I hope this helps and for Sailors **CONUS** (AERR does not pay for SMEs OCONUS) ask your khakis what they are doing to help you advance.  I am a couple of years removed from my TDYs but the AERR for each rate is every year, and they can apply and get any updated briefs from NETPDC leadership.

 

Hope this helps

1jl7xoe,https://github.com/austin-starks/LeadGenGPT,I used Perplexity to build LeadGenGPT: A tool for sending cold emails to people using AI,"[**LINK TO GITHUB!**](https://github.com/austin-starks/LeadGenGPT/) Please feel free to contribute by submitting a PR! Stars are also appreciated!

If you received a cold email from me, I’m sorry to break the news.

It wasn’t actually from me.

It was from an AI clone that captures my voice and writing style. This digital version crafts personalized emails that sound like they came from an old college roommate, but without any of my human anxiety or hesitation.

Here’s how I created a free, open-source fully automated system that researches influencers, understands their content, and generates hyper-personalized emails.

# Why I created LeadGenGPT, an open-source Lead Generation System

I created this system out of a desperate need. I had to find people that wanted to partner with me for my content.

I first did the traditional approach. I had an Excel Spreadsheet, went to YouTube, and found influencers within my niche.

I then watched their content, trying to figure out if I liked them or not, and hoped to remember key facts about the influencers so I could demonstrate that I was paying attention to them.

I wasn’t.

Finally, I searched for their email. If I found, I typed out an email combining everything I knew and hoped for a response.

All-in-all, the process took me around 5 to 15 minutes per person. It was also anxiety-inducing and demoralizing – I wasn’t getting a bunch of traction despite understanding the potential of doing the outreach. I thought about hiring some from the Philippines to do the work for me.

But then I started deploying AI. And now, you can too faster than it takes to send one personalized email manually. Let me show you how.

# How to set up and deploy the hyperpersonalized email system?

Using the lead generation system is actually quite simple. Here is a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1)** Downloading the source code from GitHub

**Step 2)** Installing the dependencies with

    npm install

**Step 3)** Creating an account on Requesty and SendGrid and generating API keys for each

**Step 4)** Create a file called .env and inputting the following environment variables

    SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
    CLOUD_DB=mongodb://your_cloud_db_connection_string
    LOCAL_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/leadgen_db
    REQUESTY_API_KEY=your_requesty_api_key
    TEST_EMAIL=your_test_email@example.com
    SENDGRID_EMAIL=your_sendgrid_email@example.com
    FROM_NAME=""Your Name""
    FROM_FIRST_NAME=FirstName

You should replace all of the values with the actual values you’ll use. Note: for my personal use-cases, I automatically send emails connected locally to my email for testing. If this is undesirable for you, you may want to update the code.

**Step 5)** Update *src/sendEmail.ts* to populate the file with a list of emails that you will send.

    const PEOPLE: { email: string; name: string }[] = [
    // Add emails here
    ]

To figure out *how* to acquire this list, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s Deep Research. I wrote an article about it here and created a video demonstration.

**Step 7)** Update the system prompt in *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts*! This step allows you to personalize your email by adding information about what you’re working on, facts about you, and how you want the email to sound.

For example, in the repo now, you’ll see the following for *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts.*

    const COLD_OUTREACH_PROMPT = `Today is ${moment()
      .tz(""America/New_York"")
      .format(""MMMM D, YYYY"")} (EST)

    You will generate an answer using valid HTML. You will NOT use bold or italics. It will just be text. You will start with the body tags, and have the ""container"" class for a div around it, and the ""signature"" class for the signature.
    
    The call to action should be normal and personable, such as ""Can we schedule 15 minutes to chat?"" or ""coffee on me"" or something normal.
    
    For Example:
    
    <body>
        <div class=""container"">
            <p>Hey {user.firstName},</p>
            
            <p>[Personal fact or generic line about their content]. My name is [Your Name] and [a line about your company/product].</p>
            
            <p>[Call to action]</p>
            <p>[Ask a time to schedule or something ""let me know what you think; let me know your thoughts""
            <div class=""signature"">
                <p>Best,<br>
                ${process.env.FROM_FIRST_NAME || process.env.FROM_NAME}</p>

Here is where you’ll want to update:

* The instructions section
* The facts about you
* Your company and product
* Guidelines and constraints
* Response formatting

Finally, after setting up the system, you can proceed with the most important step!

**Step 8)** Send your first hyperpersonalized email! Run *src/sendEmail.ts* and the terminal will ask you questions such as if you want to run it one at a time (interactive mode) or if you want to send them all autonomously (automatic mode).

If you choose interactive mode, it will ask for your confirmation every time it sends an email. I recommend this when you first start using the application.

    Generating email for User A...
    Subject: Opportunity to Collaborate
    [Email content displayed]
    Send this email? (y/yes, n/no, t/test, , s/skip, cs/change subject): y
    Email sent to user-a@example.com

In automatic mode, the emails will send constantly with a 10 second delay per email. Do this when you’re 100% confident in your prompt to send hyperpersonalized emails without ANY manual human intervention.

This system works by using Perplexity, which is capable of searching the web for details about the user. Using those results, it constructs a hyperpersonalized email that you can send to them via SendGrid.

But sending hyperpersonalized emails isn’t the only thing the platform can do. It can also follow-up.

# Other features of LeadGenGPT for cold outreach

In addition to sending the initial email, the tool has functionality for:

* Email validation
* Preventing multiple initial emails being sent to the same person
* Updating the email status
* Sending follow-ups after the pre-defined period of time

By automating both initial outreach and follow-up sequences, LeadGenGPT handles the entire email workflow while maintaining personalization. It’s literally an all-in-one solution for small businesses to expand their sales outreach. All for free.

How cool is that?

# Turning Over to the Dark Side

However, I recognize this technology has significant ethical implications. By creating and open-sourcing this tool, I’ve potentially contributed to the AI spam problem already plaguing platforms like Reddit and TikTok, which could soon overwhelm our inboxes.

I previously wrote:

>“Call me old-fashion, but even though I LOVE using AI to help me build software and even create marketing emails for my app, using AI to generate hyper-personalized sales email feels… wrong.” — me

This responsibility extends beyond me alone. The technology ecosystem — from Perplexity’s search capabilities to OpenAI’s language models — has made these systems possible. The ethical question becomes whether the productivity benefits for small businesses outweigh the potential downsides.

For my business, the impact has been transformative. With the manual approach, I sent just 14 messages over a month before giving up.

[Pic: My color-coded spreadsheet for sending emails](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eGgrVWc9U14HIUk4o8LsBw.png)

With this tool, I was literally able to send the same amount of emails… in about 3 minutes.

[Pic: A screenshot showing how many more AI-Generated emails I sent in a day](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lxOJrocRBYkFFZ2jddqZjA.png)

Since then, I’ve sent over 130 more. That number will continue to increase, as I spend more time and energy selling my platform and less time building it. As a direct result, I went from literally 0 responses to over half a dozen.

I couldn’t have done this without AI.

This is what most people, even most of Wall Street, doesn’t understand about AI.

It’s not about making big tech companies even richer. It’s about making small business owners more successful. With this lead generation system, I’ve received magnitudes more interest for my trading platform [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) that I could’ve never done without it. I can send the emails to people that I know are interested in it, and can dedicate more of my energy into developing a platform that people want to use.

So while I understand the potential of this to be problematic, I can’t ignore the insane impact. To those who decide to use this tool, I urge you to do so responsibly. Comply with local laws such as CAN-SPAM, don’t keep emailing people who have asked you to stop, and always focus on delivering genuine value rather than maximizing volume. The goal should be building authentic connections, not flooding inboxes.

# Concluding Thoughts

This prototype is just the beginning. While the tool has comprehensive features for sending emails, creating follow-ups, and updating the status, imagine a fully autonomous lead generation system that understands the best time to send the emails and the best subjects to hook the recipient.

Such a future is not far away.

As AI tools become more sophisticated, the line between human and machine communication continues to blur. While some might see this as concerning, I view it as liberating — freeing up valuable time from manual research and outreach so we can focus on building meaningful relationships once connections are established.

If you’re looking to scale your outreach efforts without sacrificing personalization, give [**LeadGenGPT**](https://github.com/austin-starks/LeadGenGPT/) a try and see how it transforms your lead generation process

1jl7rvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1jl7rvm/opinions_on_caffeine_and_breastfeeding/,Opinions on caffeine and breastfeeding?,"I have a 2 week old (first time mom), and have had 1-2 coffees every day for the most part since giving birth. I try not to drink my coffee right before a feed, but I don’t pay too much attention to making sure it’s exactly 2-3 hours between feeds. My baby’s been soooo good for the most part in terms of sleeping/eating. 

But yesterday, I noticed all day she seemed to be fighting sleep. She’d be tired at regular intervals of the day but just never seemed to want to fall asleep fully. My in-laws also happen to be visiting this week. They’ve been great and have helped out so much, but I’m just feeling bothered by my MIL, who happens to be obsessed with nutrition/eating healthy. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a pretty healthy person, but she has a health condition that necessitates an extremely clean diet and she kinda projects all of her neuroticism on everyone else. 

So we’re playing a board game, my baby won’t go to or at least stay asleep, and she’s been awake most of the day. I made myself a cup of coffee before we started our game (right after I fed her) and ended up feeding her again at the table maybe an hour and a half later because she seemed hungry. I also had an iced coffee earlier in the afternoon. After I complained about her not being able to sleep all day, my MIL says it’s probably the caffeine I’ve had today (2 cups) and reminded me that babies get whatever I consume through the milk. Like yes I know, but from everything I’ve learned, it’s really only trace amounts of caffeine that come through the breast milk. Then she mentioned that her daughter (my SIL) doesn’t drink caffeine at all while breastfeeding for that reason, and that she never did herself (although she only breastfed one of her 3 kids, and just for a few months. Chose to bottle feed the first two)

And now my husband, who is also extremely nutrition-conscious and is pretty much is on board with anything his mother has to say, is probably going to annoy me about any coffee I have going forward. 

Side note: they also think keeping a phone or laptop near a baby is bad because of the radiation. Not saying it’s completely nonsensical, but most research suggests that kind of non-ionizing radiation does no harm to the human brain, but they choose to “air on the side of caution.” 

But yeah, anyways, I’d love to hear other perspectives. And if I’m completely wrong and I shouldn’t be having any caffeine whatsoever, then fine. I just feel like I’m losing my mind and am being shamed for no reason. ",14,1743092296.0,breastfeeding,43,0.89,False
