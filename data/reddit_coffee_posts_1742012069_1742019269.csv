1jboh63,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jboh63/how_to_move_on_after_a_breakup/,How to move on after a breakup?,"""A breakup feels like a storm, but every storm passes.""

When Raj's five-year relationship ended, he felt lost. Nights were sleepless, songs felt personal, and even coffee tasted bitter. But one day, he realized—he had two choices: stay stuck in pain or rebuild stronger.

How to Move On After a Breakup?

1. Accept & Feel the Pain – It’s okay to cry, scream, or write angry letters (just don’t send them!). Healing starts with feeling.

2. Cut Off Contact – No late-night texts, no social media stalking. Imagine a wound—stop reopening it.

3. Rediscover Yourself – Pick up old hobbies, hit the gym, start journaling—who were you before them?

4. Surround Yourself with Positivity – Friends, books, nature, and new experiences heal faster than isolation.

5. Set New Goals – Whether it’s learning a skill, traveling, or growing in your career, focus forward.


Raj took small steps—joined a football club, started a side hustle, and months later, he laughed without faking it. You will too. The best revenge? A happy, thriving you.

1jbog6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jbog6l/im_finding_out_what_happened_to_the_friend_i/,I'm finding out what happened to the friend I haven't seen since high school,"For pretty much as long as I can remember I’ve had insomnia. I remember being a little kid, like four or five, and sitting up in the middle of the night listening to my little cassette radio. As I got older that became routine for me. I would lay awake for an hour or two, long enough to know sleep wasn’t coming any time soon, then I would get up and look for something quiet to do.

Sometimes I would listen to a cassette tape, sometimes I would read, sometimes I would play with my toys. I preferred to read typically, or listen to tapes, and usually around three or four in the morning I would finally drift off to sleep, then wake up a few hours later to go to work, or school when I was younger.

As I got older I tried all sorts of things to sleep. If there’s a home remedy or over the counter sleep medication, I’ve tried it. They work for a little while, then the insomnia slowly takes over. I’ve tried most of the ones that have to be prescribed too, and while they come with worse side effects they end up the same way as the other remedies. First it’s just lying in bed with my eyes closed for longer than usual. Then it’s tossing and turning for a while before sleep finally comes for me. Then, within a few days or weeks I’m back to staring at my dark ceiling, wishing sleep would come for me. I’ve tried rotating the remedies and medications. One night of chamomile tea, one night of melatonin supplements, one night with benadryl (hello hat man). But even that doesn’t work, or doesn’t work very well, or doesn’t work for very long.

The only thing that has ever worked consistently is the, uh, devil’s lettuce, and I prefer not to over use that one. So on nights before a big meeting or project at work, I smoke a little, and pass out nice and early. But the rest of the time, I’m staring at my ceiling, reading a book, listening to a podcast, or playing around on my phone. And yes, I’ve tried putting my phone in another room an hour before bedtime, that doesn’t help either.

If there’s a remedy for insomnia I’ve tried it, and if some shaman in the mountains or wherever says they found a new one, I try it.

So when I got an email from my highschool best friend’s old email address saying they had found the cure for insomnia, of course I went to meet up with her in an empty parking lot, at midnight, to get this miracle cure.

I’m stupid okay, sue me.

To be fair, I haven’t seen this person in quite a while, but we were best friends for like eight years before we fell out of touch, she knew all about my insomnia, it actually made a lot of sense that she would reach out to me after finding a miracle cure. People say desperation is the most dangerous emotion, and after a lifetime of being desperate for a good night’s sleep, I can agree with that.

So I get to this parking lot, it used to be a Borders bookstore back in the olden days, and right there is my old best friend in the same car she drove in highschool. I’ll admit, that seemed weird to me, but hey maybe she just really loved that car, right? It was in good condition back then (a 2005 Subaru) and still looked to be in good condition when I saw her that night.

I wrote off all the weirdness because I’m desperate. You try going your whole life without consistently getting a good night of sleep, and then tell me you wouldn’t go to an abandoned parking lot in the dead of night for a miracle cure. I want to sleep normally, without having to switch to a new drug every week, without having to take those horrible sleeping pills my doctor prescribed that make me feel even worse when I wake up. 

So I got there, parked my car next to hers, got out and gave her a big hug. She had gotten married sometime in the last twenty years, and showed me her ring then talked about her wife. I’d had a little crush on her our freshman year, and she hadn’t come out as gay in highschool, so that was a bit of a surprise in that “oh wow people are more complicated than you realize” kind of a way.

I told her what I’ve been up to since high school, working as an electrician and picking up a bunch of hobbies to keep myself entertained on sleepless nights.

When I brought that up she grinned and said, “Come here, you have no idea how great this is going to be.”

She opened her trunk and sitting there in the middle was a medium sized flower pot. There was a plant growing in it, and I could see the beginning of flower buds that were just starting to unfold. 

I stared at her, shock and probably a bit of betrayal on my face and said, “Amy. That’s a plant. Just… a flower from the looks of it. If you’re going to tell me to make tea, I’ve tried every single ‘sleep tea’ that exists.”

She nodded excitedly, totally skipping my frustration, “Not just any plant James, that’s a variation of the moon flower, it’s been cross bred with a blue pea butterfly flower. You probably don’t care about all the scientific bits and pieces, but basically this is going to make you sleep, and forget you ever had insomnia.”

I stared at her again, trying to find the words to explain my disappointment. Finally I said, “How?”

She pulled a little plastic sandwich bag out of her purse and showed me some silvery blue flower petals, and said, “Once the flowers start blooming remove one at a time and dry them by hanging them upside down in a dry place. Once they’re dry, grind the petals into a powder and sprinkle that powder all over your pillow-”

I cut in, “My pillow? I don’t make tea or something?”

She laughed, “Nope. Just sprinkle the dust on your pillow whenever you can’t sleep. And then water it every single day. No slacking, you have to remember to water it or it won’t work.”

I chuckled, I’d been put on ADHD medications our senior year and could never actually remember to take them, so I’d started selling them to rich kids instead. When my mom found out she was really mad and grounded me for a few days, which I thought was weird (I had been expecting a few months if I got caught) but apparently she told my dad she was actually kind of impressed. Anyway, Amy must have remembered that story with the mischievous look she gave me.

I won’t lie, I felt weird about the whole thing. A flower I’d never heard of was supposed to cure my insomnia?

I asked, “If this flower is so amazing why isn’t everyone using it?”

Amy shrugged, “The best kept secrets hide in plain sight, right?”

I lifted an eyebrow, “I guess?”

She smiled again and gestured to the flower, “Since we’re old friends I won’t charge you what I normally would for this. Typically I charge people a few hundred for one of these, especially with how close it is to blooming, but I’ll sell it to you for just $100. You want it?”

To be honest, if she hadn’t charged me I would have walked away without the flower. The whole thing felt really suspicious to me, but when she said she charged for the plants it made me feel better. I guess I thought if she had ulterior motives she would give it to me for free, but charging me made it seem more like a legitimate business deal. I got an image in my head of her selling these plants on Etsy, or some other online retailer, and it calmed me slightly. She was always the girl who did bake sales and lemonade stands, so this too just fit in with what I knew about her.

I pulled out my wallet, gave her the wad of twenties I keep in there just in case, and put the plant in the backseat of my car. She grinned again, said she hoped it would work for me, and then told me to water it everyday when I woke up and she would email the other instructions in a few days since it wouldn’t bloom for a while anyway.

Before she got in her car she said, “I suggest keeping it on your nightstand, maybe it’s the placebo effect but I feel like it works better when you keep it in the same room where you sleep.”

I was unlocking my car when she said that and I stopped, “What about pollinating? Doesn’t it need to be outside to bloom?”

I wasn’t great with plants but my mom loved them and I’d learned a little here and there from her. I had a vague understanding that flowering plants needed to be pollinated by some type of bug in order to really grow. Apparently there’s a tree or something that’s so old it’s pollinated by beetles, because it evolved before bees. But plants were my moms hyperfixation, not mine.

But instead she said, “They self pollinate. Again, I won’t bore you with the specifics, but trust me. I know what I’m talking about. I’ve been working with this plant for a long time now.”

So I did. I trusted her and I took the plant home with me. I set it on my nightstand, watered it, and layed down.

Obviously I didn’t notice any changes right away. I watered the plant faithfully, watching the slow progress it made as it climbed steadily towards my ceiling. I found myself fascinated by the plant, watching it when I couldn’t sleep, entranced by the way it slowly wound and curved its way up. There were a few times where I found myself thinking that at least I had something new to do while I was lying awake, even if this silly plant never helped me sleep.

Finally, after, I think a few weeks, or maybe a month or two (I wasn’t paying super close attention) I got my first bloom. To be honest, I didn’t want to pluck it. It was like a combination between a crocus, an iris, and a magnolia blossom. The petals were silver at the center of the plant, stretching out into a midnight blue that took my breath away, and they almost seemed to sigh out of the plant, like a puff of mist on a clear winter night. I was afraid if I got too close, if I so much as breathed on it too hard, it would disappear.

I hesitated to pluck it for a few days, but I finally gave in. I had been looking up the proper way to dry and store herbs, and I had ordered a little enclosed rack just for that purpose. I hung the bloom up on the drying rack, went to work, and forgot about it (ADHD what can I say) until the next bloom appeared on the plant.

When the next bloom unfurled I remembered I had one drying, and ran into my kitchen. There it was, dry and ready to be used. I rubbed one of the dried petals between my hands, over top of my pillow, until a fine blue dust slowly shimmered into existence on the white pillowcase. It was only eight at that point so I got up, did some chores, and went back after a few hours.

Shortly after ten I laid down and… nothing. I laid down. There was no magical sensation of sleep, no sudden drowsiness, I was just laying on my pillow.

And then it was morning.

I don’t remember falling asleep, I don't remember dreaming, it was like all the time from ten PM to seven AM was just snipped away. In some ways it was really nice, better than laying awake all night wishing for sleep anyway. 

I can’t say I felt particularly rested that first night, more disoriented than anything else, but I’m pretty used to that feeling so I went about my day as normal. When I got home from work that afternoon I remembered Amy, and pulled up my phone to email her, so I could let her know it seemed to be working so far, but I couldn’t find her email. 

I figured I must have deleted it without meaning to, so I looked her up on facebook, but she wasn’t there. That wasn’t too weird, a lot of people I know have started getting away from facebook, so I looked her up on instagram but still couldn’t find her.

I barely slept that night, not because of my insomnia, but because I was trying so hard to find Amy and I just couldn’t. Google searches didn’t return anything, I couldn’t find her in any city or state databases, I couldn’t even find any references to her on the website for our highschool (they do this time machine thing where you can look people up, actually super cool). It was like Amy never existed.

I don’t remember getting in bed, but I woke up in time for my first alarm, snuggled down under the covers. I got up and started getting ready for work, resolving to myself that I would find my old yearbook and locate Amy somehow, but by the time I got to work I had completely forgotten about my search.

When I got home that night I remembered briefly, but I was so tired all I wanted to do was lay down. I went to my couch first, played on my phone and read for a bit, then drifted to my bed. I laid down but sleep refused to come as I tossed and turned. After an hour I broke, got up and retrieved one of the petals from my kitchen, then crumbled it onto my pillow.

I drifted off while staring at the plant, and had a single dream. In my dream I was trying to water the plant. I would fill a pitcher with water, but when I tried to empty the water onto the plant something else would come out instead. Sometimes it was more dirt, sometimes it was a different liquid, sometimes it was nothing at all. 

When I woke up in the morning I felt disoriented again, but slightly more rested than usual. I didn’t have to work, so I stayed in bed for a little while and relaxed. After a bit I remembered my abandoned search, and hurled myself out of bed to run to my garage. 

I dug through box after box until I finally had all four of my highschool yearbooks. I flipped through them all looking for Amy and in every single one… I found her. Crisis I made up in my head averted, I packed the boxes back up and went on about my day.

As I’ve said before, I’m not a smart man. I should have listened to my gut instinct.

I went about my life normally, making taking care of the plant (I named him Charlie) a normal part of my day. I would wake up, dump the remnants of my glass of water into the soil, pluck new blooms and hang them up to dry, then go on with my day. At night I would sprinkle the powder onto my pillow, lay down, and wake up in the morning. I finally felt like a normal person.

It may sound weird but I know my fellow insomniacs will get me: I’ve always envied people who can just lay down and sleep. And I don’t just mean people who say they’re out as soon as they hit the pillow, I mean I envy every single person who regularly gets a good night's sleep without the use of drugs. And for the first time in my life, I finally knew what that felt like.

Which is why I ignored all the red flags.

Now some of the red flags are obvious to you I’m sure: bought a plant out of the back of a Subaru in a parking lot late at night from someone I hadn’t seen in almost twenty years, didn’t do any research, etc.

But there are others I should probably tell you about too, like the fact that most of my dreams seemed to revolve around Charlie. That’s weird right? Pretty much every night I would dream about something to do with Charlie. I ignored it, I figured my subconscious was so excited to finally be getting regular sleep that it was hyper fixated on what was causing it.

Then there was the fact that sometimes I would just wake up in my bed without ever remembering getting in bed in the first place. When that happened I usually couldn’t remember any dreams either, and to be honest it made me feel a lot better about getting in bed at a reasonable time every night.

Then there were the dreams. I don't know how to explain this, but they were addictive. On the nights when I did dream it would always start out being about Charlie, then it would move on into some other subject matter. The dreams were vivid, vibrant, they almost felt more real than the real world. I would wake up some mornings in tears because I had to leave whatever incredible world my subconscious had been in.

I had a few weeks where I was getting the best sleep of my life, having the most amazing dreams, and feeling rested every single day. Any weirdness surrounding the flower was easy to forget about, especially in comparison to how nice it was to finally be sleeping.

Then one day I forgot to give Charlie water. Based on what Amy had said, I had assumed the plant would wither or stop producing flowers if I failed to water it. But when I woke up the next day, a cold sense of dread in my gut as I remembered that Charlie hadn’t been watered the day before, I was relieved to see that Charlie was perfectly fine. 

I apologized, gave him an extra helping of water, and grabbed my phone from the night stand. It was five PM.

I flung myself out of bed, as if moving fast enough would let me make it to work on time, nine hours ago, then stood in my bedroom feeling confused and a little scared. I’ve never slept for more than eight or ten hours, and I’ve certainly never slept for almost twenty hours before. 

After a few minutes of confused standing I grabbed my phone again and called my boss. I told him I was sick, and had accidentally overslept. I blamed new medication and I think he probably bought it.

He gave me a warning, told me not to let it happen again, and that was it. 

But the whole experience didn't just rattle me, I was oddly terrified. I went back to my old yearbook, found Amy again, and looked up just her last name. This time, I actually found something useful: her mom’s Facebook.

I sent a message saying I knew her daughter in high school and wanted to ask her something, left my phone number and said if she was comfortable talking with me, to give me a call.

I didn’t really want to go back to sleep that night, I didn’t trust sleep as much anymore, so I spent most of the night playing video games before crashing on my couch. I got a normal fitful sleep that left me feeling tired and groggy in the morning. Perfect, just how I like it.

After three days of couch sleeping I finally got a call from Amy’s mom, Meredith.

I didn’t recognize the number at first, and answered expecting just a regular spam call.

The woman on the other end said, “Is this James? Amy’s friend?”

I grinned, I had finally made some progress, “Yeah! This must be Meredith?”

She sounded tired, “That’s right. You should be able to get permission to visit her from the hospital she’s in if that’s why you wanted to talk.”

It felt like all the air had been slammed out of me, all I could say was, “What?”

She sighed, “Is that not what you’re calling about?”

I was flustered, ‘What happened to Amy? She seemed fine the last time I saw her.”

Meredith laughed but it was humorless, “I take it you haven’t seen Amy in quite some time. Why are you calling?”

I was quiet for a moment as I tried to collect myself. Finally I said, “Can we meet for coffee or something? I feel like this conversation might be easier in person.”

I heard movement on the other line as Meredith said, “Sure, I’m heading to First Memorial hospital right now, I’ll meet you there, we can get coffee in the hospital cafe, it’s really not bad.”

I chuckled uncomfortably, “Okay, it’ll take me about twenty minutes to get there. Is that okay?”

Meredith said it was, and I rushed to grab my keys, then got in my car. I drove to First Memorial, feeling like reality had just collapsed around my ears. Apparently something had happened to Amy right after I last saw her, which didn’t explain why I couldn’t find her online anywhere, but it was a start to unraveling the weird little mystery I was in.

I got to First Memorial, parked across the street because I refuse to pay for hospital parking (that should honestly be illegal), and walked inside. The cafe was right next to the visitors entrance, and sitting at a table was a woman who looked a lot like an older version of Amy. I smiled as I walked towards her, then extended my hand for a shake.

I said, “Hi, ma’am. I’m James, Amy’s friend.”

Meredith smiled sadly, “You can call me Meredith. I love that you youngsters always introduce yourselves as her friends, makes me feel like she might wake up one day.”

Nothing she said was making sense, so I excused myself to get a cup of coffee. Once I had it in hand she said, “Do you want to walk up to her room with me? We can discuss whatever is going on, on the way.”

I agreed, and followed her to the elevators. It seemed to be a familiar journey for her, and I felt strange beginning my story right away.

I asked, “So do you mind telling me what happened to her?”

Meredith gave me a quizzical look but said, “Okay. Well you know she graduated high school and went abroad to study. She met her girlfriend there, they got engaged, and came back to the states together. Then, about a year later I got a call from Camilla. She said Amy hadn’t been sleeping well for a while, then all of a sudden Cammy got up one day and Amy wouldn’t wake up. She looked like she was sleeping peacefully, but she wouldn’t wake up. We called an ambulance and…”

She trailed off as we exited the elevator, the rest of her story was pretty clear. As we approached the doorway to room 417 Meredith said, “So why are you here? I thought all of Amy’s close friends knew about all of this. Not to be rude but…”

Again she trailed off and I hesitated for a moment before saying, “Okay, this is going to sound super weird but please give me a chance. I knew Amy in high school, we talked a little after graduation, then we pretty much fell out of touch. Until a few months ago when I got an email from her.”

Meredith’s eyebrows had been climbing up her forehead the entire time I was talking, and by the time I said she had emailed me they were basically in her hairline. She didn’t believe me and I didn’t blame her.

I continued, “I responded to the email and she said she had this miracle insomnia cure. I’ve been an insomniac basically my whole life, so I was really hopeful. So we met up and she gave me-”

Meredith cut me off, “She gave you a plant named Charlie.”

Her words shocked me so badly I felt like I had been punched, and I know I reeled back as if I had been hit.

I said, “Well yes, but no, but... I named the plant Charlie, and I never told her that.”

Meredith shook her head and opened the door to room 417, then gestured for me to walk in. There were two beds in the large room, divided by a curtain. In one bed was Amy, looking exactly as she had when I saw her a few months ago. In the other bed was a woman with dark hair and olive skin. They both looked asleep. As if they would wake up at any moment.

Meredith was studying me carefully as she pulled out a chair and sat down. She said, “Alright I’ll tell you the whole story. Amy got in a car wreck right before she left for the study abroad program. She suffered a TBI and developed pretty severe insomnia. When she came back from Italy, Cammy-” here she gestured to the pretty olive skinned woman, “Wasn’t the only thing she brought back with her. They also had this plant they called Charlie. I never got a good explanation on where it came from, but it was really beautiful. It was clearly their prized possession too, it sat on the mantle in their home, the place of honor you might call it. All she would tell me was that Charlie helped her sleep better. She explained the whole process to me, and offered me some of the flowers in case I ever needed help sleeping. I had a strange feeling about it though, so I said no. But she and Cammy adored their plant, so I didn't want to say anything to poo-poo it.Then after a while Amy started having trouble getting up. She was sleeping longer, she and Cammy were fighting a lot so I thought she was just depressed. I wrote it off as normal, I didn't...”

Meredith sniffled, there was clearly still a lot of regret there.

She went on, “Then I got that call from Cammy. She kept saying something about Amy ‘not doing it right’, she kept talking about Charlie but I didn’t understand what she was talking about, so I didn’t really absorb it. Amy was in the hospital, in a coma, for two months before Cammy joined her. I don’t know what happened. We cleared out their home and sold it when doctors said they didn’t think the two of them would wake up any time soon. I didn’t see the plant and I didn’t even think about it. Until now.”

At some point during her story I had collapsed into the chair to next to her, and I was just staring at Amy and the other woman.

Finally I managed to say, “Amy didn’t come out in high school.”

Meredith shook her head, “Right, she came out to me while she was abroad. I think she was scared to come out until she really knew for sure.”

I took a deep breath, “I never knew she was gay. But when I saw her a few weeks ago, she told me she had gotten married. She- I don’t remember her saying what her wife’s name was, but she told me she was married to a woman she had met in college.”

Meredith leaned towards me, her voice came out in a scared whisper, “I dream about her all the time. Dreams where she’s holding Charlie and begging me to take him. She tells me how much she and Cammy miss me, and she begs me to join her.”

Tears were forming in her eyes, the dreams had clearly been very hard on her. She grabbed my wrist and I was shocked by how strong her grip was. She studied my eyes intensely, “The dreams stopped in September.”

Something in my chest, some little shred of hope that this was all just craziness with a reasonable explanation, melted into a pool of terror. I whispered back, “I saw Amy, in September.”

Meredith nodded sadly, “I can’t help you James, I’m sorry.”

I sagged back against my chair, “You don’t have any ideas that could help? Any information I might find useful?”

Meredith shook her head, a resolute calm turning her face to stone, “No, I’m sorry. I need you to leave now, I can’t have another person on my conscience. I wish you all the best, James.”

I left the hospital feeling like someone had just popped my birthday balloon. I felt like I now understood just enough to understand that this was insane and I have no idea what’s going on. 

I wish I had a better resolution, but I don’t. I’m still watering Charlie faithfully every day, still dreaming about him when I use the petals. But I feel trapped. I can’t sleep at all when I don’t use the flower, but when I do use it I’m sleeping longer and longer each time.

I hope I’m wrong, but I think I’ll be joining Cammy and Amy before too long.

# Choosing the Right Developer

Picking a developer? Let's make it simple. Forget flashy portfolios – focus on proven WordPress expertise. Your ideal developer speaks both tech and business. They should understand custom development, SEO, and your goals. Freelancer, agency, or remote team – each has merit, but expertise trumps size.

Do your homework right. Check similar projects they've built. Call their clients – Bristol businesses will tell it straight. Watch how they communicate. Do they ask about your business goals or just talk design? Response times matter, too. The right developer asks tough questions and gives straight answers.

Why choose local? We get Bristol. We know the market, the culture, the community. Need an urgent fix or face-to-face chat? We're here, not halfway across the world. This isn't just about websites – it's about building Bristol's digital future together. When local businesses thrive, we all win.

You were always gonna learn things that just took up your time. Liam pulled his goggles tight as sparked up a flame on the burner. Valerie was hiding her phone under the desk texting out of line of sight of the teacher. She tugged on Liam’s lab coat watching him slowly mix chemicals in a beaker. 

“You know this class would be easier if I had some assistance.” Valerie all but ignored Liam as she leaned back in her chair. A speech started to leave her mouth about how pointless this class was to her life goals. Liam didn’t focus on her words but the mixture swirling in front of him. Valerie’s eyes started to spark interest as the formula began to glow. A bright red color vibrated out of the beaker. “Once you finish mixing this will glow for exactly one minute straight.” Valerie was stumped at exactly what he did. Jessica was also in awe watching a couple tables over. Even the teacher was impressed as she walked over checking their work. Valerie asked Liam where he learned to do something so meaningless. “Internet my dear Valerie.” Suddenly her expression faded only to pop back up as Liam flashed her the thirty minute video he watched. 

The lunch room was so loud no one could hear themselves think. The smell of pizza and spicy curly fries filled the air. Bobby tried to hold in his burps as Jessica bored him about her trip to the mall after school. Liam sat down as he popped open his water letting it drip down the sides of the bottle. The conversation at the table quickly changed as Valerie asked Liam for his chemistry notes. 

“Hey I called dibs on those notes first.” Liam leaned back as Delilah towered over him. She bent over kissing him as Bobby tried to swipe his water from his hand. Liam dodged every attempt to steal his bottle until Delilah swiped it for herself taking a big swig. Bobby settled with stealing a fry off his plate as Delilah took a seat at the table. “I think I heard something about the mall?” The conversation about the mall picked back up. Soon eyes turned to Liam.

“Sorry can’t, I have to work tonight.” All the faces turned bumed as Liam reassured them he was free tomorrow. The last bell left Liam on the steps outside sending out texts. He was waiting for Bobby who offered to give him a ride. Soon they were in the car. Bobby’s four door didn’t have a lot of legroom but the sunroof gave a feeling of excitement. The car ride consisted of the pairs top picks for edgest music and the recurring topic of girls. Bobby left Liam standing in front of the school. Kids dashed by racing to their parents as Liam scanned the parking lot. He finally spotted his parents' car. Liam leaned against the passenger door as he scrolled through his phone. His eyes wandered watching the riot that was an elementary school. As Liam waited he felt eyes on him. He looked up from his phone as he saw bright red hair leaving in a car. Before his mind could process anything the parking lot filled with his family. The ride home was quiet. Brian and Sofia seemed to be whispering to each other as the girls just played on their phones. Once everyone was home Liam asked to borrow Doge’s car for work. Once he had the keys he ran up to his room to change. Liam pulled off his shirt as he searched for a fresh one. As he pulled on a new pair of jeans a knock hit his door. Amber was standing there holding on to the bottom of her hair. “What's up bud?” 

Liam circled his room gathering up all his things as he waited for her response. Amber just stood nervously trying to decide what to say. Suddenly she just walked inside sitting on his bed. Liam relaxed himself as she sat down next to her. Amber balled her hands up on her knees.

“H-h-h-how do you k-k-kiss a girl?” Liam wasn’t exactly expecting to have this talk with her. He smiled as he leaned back in bed. 

“I wish it was that easy, and for you it’s even harder, you're too young ok how are you even gonna know if a girl is gay? Listen, just be kind and nice and respectful, and try to understand that it’s rude to force yourself onto someone, telling someone how you feel can be a burden for them so my best advice is to learn social cues and really get to know people.” Liam rubbed her back as he explained his stance on the matter. 

“Thank you.” Amber hugged her brother before leaving him alone. Liam checked the time before heading out. Pulling onto the road he watched for bad drivers. Liam popped on the radio as the town came into view. Even with traffic he made it just on time. Liam pulled himself inside as he pulled his hair behind his and popped on his apron. 

“And here I thought you wouldn’t make it.” Mac’s old crotchety voice echoed through coughs. Liam grabbed a stack of plates off a table as he moved into the back. 

“I'm on time Mac, relax.” Liam dumped the stack into the sink as he ran the water filling it up. “Amber had a question for me, she’s too mature for her age.” Mac leaned back in his chair listening as he pulled on his long grey beard. “And Sam has a boyfriend, soon they will both be going to parties and drinking.” Mac pulled himself up scooping up empty glasses off the bar. “Ten years from now and they'll be adults.” Little bits of food scraped off into the drain as Mac moved to the grill as he plopped on another burger. 

“I swear kids these days grow up so much faster than back in my day, I blame the Internet.” Mac started to rant about how crazy the times have gotten. Once the dishes were mostly clean Liam moved over to the deep fryer trying to help Mac with orders. The night moved along as people shuffled in and out for drinks and food. When the sun decided to lay down for bed Liam wiped all the crumbs and stains he could find. Mac tried to lend a hand but Liam pushed him down into his seat behind the bar. “I'm alright to…oeugh elllk.” Mac’s words came with flem and distaste as he leaned forward holding onto himself. Liam just wouldn’t listen as he finished cleaning up. 

Once the job was done and Mac seemed to get a hold of himself Liam said his goodbyes. His bed was welcoming as he returned home. Luckily he made it just in time for dinner. Steak and beans filled his tummy good before he said goodnight to everyone. Liam closed his door as he pulled off his shirt. PJ pulled his little cat head up. Laying in his favorite chair under Liam’s bed that was sitting on top of bookshelves like a single bunk bed. As Liam climbed up top his faithful companion followed him to slumberland. 

The morning came with coffee. Everyone was addicted to the drug that was caffeine. Sugars and cream only hid the dangerous long term effects of this morning drink. Sofia helped Brian prepare a light breakfast as the kitchen filled with faces. 

“Oh yes gimmie,” Amber said, begging for her morning cup. Brian pulled her hair back keeping it out of her face. All Sam could focus on was the beautiful drink in everyone's hands. Amber on the other hand was lost in her book while nibbling on bacon. Amber couldn’t help herself from kissing both girls on the cheek before they left the house. Liam followed a bit behind as he climbed into the car. Sam was locked to her phone following James’s social media. Almost every post had a like from her. By the time they got to the school she liked them all. Sam barely got out of the car as she watched Amber bolt into the school. Amber found her way to her classroom quickly. Amber sat at her desk rocking in her chair in anticipation. It didn’t take long before the teacher appeared. Following behind her was Crystal. Crystal ran her hands along the desks counting them as she made her way to her seat. 

“Hi.” Amber perked up greeting her friend. Crystal smiled as she asked Amber about her morning. Amber’s words left her mouth explaining the small nuances of breakfast with family. “And the b-b-b-bacon was too crispy.” 

“I like ham for breakfast, I'm sorry piggy but you must die for my breakfast.” Crystal’s voice boomed as Amber laughed at her words. The classroom filled as packets were handed out. The teacher moved around talking with each student. When she got to Crystal a conversation came up about how she was doing. Crystal seemed to be doing alright at home and was having no trouble with her work. Amber just sat quietly looking over her problems. 

“You seem to be doing better Amber, anything I can help you with?” Ms. Atler pulled her attention to Amber as she kneeled down next to her. Amber just dropped her pencil as she turned to the teacher. 

“Umm c-c-can I read if I finish all my w-work?” This question came with a smile and a resounding yes. Ms. Atler’s eyes went wide as she watched Amber drop a thick chapter book onto her desk. The day seemed to go by fast as lunch rolled around. Holding hands the girls followed their line to the pizza waiting for them. Amber and Crystal laughed at each other’s silly faces as the sound of the cafeteria drowned them out. Even though it was hard to see, Crystal could press her face against Amber’s taking in most of her expression. Amber’s hairs stood up as their eyes came cose. Amber was fond of Crystal but she didn’t dream about her like she did another. Crystal was also aware of what she was doing and asked constantly if what she was doing was ok. 

“Is this ok?” Their noses rubbed together causing an insane amount of giggles to erupt from their tiny mouths. Amber suddenly felt like she was being watched. As the line moved she turned her head. Her sister was nowhere to be seen. As she scanned the room nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Sam wasn’t in the lunch room because dodgeball was being played on the basketball court. And she was dominating. The opposite team was taking hits left and right. It was mayhem and carnage. The red rubber balls rolled across the hard ground right to Sam’s feet as she picked one of them up. Sam held her ball up high ready to strike as she came face to face with the enemy in front of her. 

“You gonna hit me with that ball sweet thang?” James just smiled as he stood in her way. James towered over her as he waited for the impact of the ball to come. Sam's finger’s gripped the rubber tight as she stood frozen. Sam dropped her head avoiding his gaze as balls pelted her calling her out. Sam just walked outside the lines as she crossed her arms in disappointment. Once the bell rang she let her rage take over. Sam quickly found James picking up his backpack as she pushed him steady on his feet. 

“You…you…are so rude, I can’t believe you.” Sam banged on his chest as she made her thoughts known. James backed up until he stopped grabbing her hands. 

“Oh come on I didn’t even do anything.” James pleaded his case as he looked into her eyes. Sam’s face flushed only to burn hot as he pulled her into a hug. Sam just let her body go limp in his. James had his hands on her back gently rubbing as his eyes caught all his friends. Standing about ten feet away they were beside themselves having a laugh. Their hands mimicked a specific gesture that most boys thought about. It would be a lie to say this genture never crossed James’s mind but he did actually have a brain and some nice qualities that stopped him from acting a fool. James just walked her to class. “Hey my parents are picking me up a bit late, over by the dumpsters you should come chill, I'll be there alone.” His words put a shock to her system. Sam just walked to her desk. Her body temperature was set to high. Nothing was even happening at the moment. Her thoughts were going crazy. She could barely focus on her book report. 

While Sam was contemplating her life Amber was enjoying her’s. Her desk was pushed up against Crystal’s as they were whispering to each other. Crystal was trying to focus on her work while simultaneously teaching Amber braille. Amber ran her fingers over the worksheet feeling the bumps. It wasn't as hard as it looked but it wasn’t so easy Amber could just learn it in a day. 

“Is this ok?” Crystal’s words came with action as she grabbed Amber’s hand and pulled it down the paper. Amber didn’t exactly know how to respond. Her hand was soft and warm. But it wasn’t the same as Kim’s hand. Amber took a deep breath and told Crystal everything was fine. Feelings were new and strange to Amber. Crystal was beautiful and kind but she just felt like a normal person. Amber wasn’t trying to feel any sort of way but she just wanted to understand it all. Why did one girl make her muscles weak and another just make her happy to see? The idea of kissing a girl was scary enough and now there was the fear of doing it and feeling nothing. Amber tried to push all these thoughts away as she enjoyed the company of her friend. 

Sam was having similar anxieties swirling around in her head as she detailed the structure of a plant cell. She was afraid that she could not hold back her feelings when it came to James. He was exactly the thing Sam feared, a boy. He was also a bad boy who smoked and cursed. Maybe she was too young to be dating. Maybe all she should be thinking about is kid stuff. Maybe she should just tell this boy to leave her alone. 

When the final bell rang Sam ran off in a hurry. Her feet slowed to a crawl as he made it outside. The sun warned her of the outside dangers. Sam gently pushed through yelling kids as she moved around the school. Once she got to the point of no return she peered around the corner. It was her worst nightmare. There he was crouched behind a dumpster smoking a fat one. Sam pulled together all her courage as she moved around the building. James just blew smoke into the air as she approached. 

“I don’t think I should see you anymore.” Sam stared at her feet trying to get her point across. James just stood trying to grab her attention. “You're a cigarette addict and I don't want to fall down a bad path like you!” As James pulled himself close she pushed him. “Are you listening to me?!” James backed up against the dumpster as he took another drag. 

“Ok I'm listening, then this will be my last smoke ever.” Another drag left his lips. Sam pulled her eyes up watching him make his vow. What these two did not know was that another set of eyes were watching them. And these quiet eyes did not like the view in front of them. Sam waited patiently for him to finish his last cig every. “Ok it's got a couple more hits left in it, hold onto it while I go take a leak.” James pulled up Sam’s hand as he placed the cigarette in it. She could barely protest s she held it out at arms length. Not a signal thought about this thing touching her lips crossed her mind. Sam was just waiting for this thing to be pulled out of her hand. And she got her wish as someone did exactly that. Sam’s arm was quickly snatched up by her mother as the smoke was taken from between her fingers. Sam’s eyes went wide. Her lips trembled trying to make words. 

“You want to explain yourself?” Sofia asked, holding Sam up by her arm. Sam fumbled her speech not knowing what to say. She came back as quick as she could with a it's not mine response. “Then who's exactly is it?” Sofia's raging stare made Sam’s arm limp as she hung from her mother. It would have been so easy for her to name drop James. But he would get in massive trouble and she wouldn't be able to see him. Sam clinched her mouth shut. “So it's your's?” 

“No! It's not mine! But I can’t tell you who it belongs to!” Sofia stomped out the cig as she continued to pull on her daughter. “You have to believe me!” Sofia wasn't hearing any of it. Sam just started crying her eyes out. It was the most unbelievable event that her mother would appear out of thin air catching her with a cigarette in her hand. Or was it. As Sam struggled to get away from her mom her eyes caught another set hiding behind the building. “You! I can't believe you!” Sam yanked her arm away as she juked past her mother. Sam tackled her sister to the ground. “You told on me!” The gils rolled around on the ground as Sam struck Amber over and over. Sofia quickly dragged Sam up by her hand. “I hate you! I never want to talk to you again!” Amber just wanted to say sorry over and over but Sam wouldn’t stop screaming at her. Amber just started crying before she ran off. Sofia couldn't catch her and hold Sam still so Sam took off running as well. Luckily for the parents their kids just ran to the car. Sam and Amber sat quiet and motionless on the drive home that is until Sofia spoke. 

“I found a cigarette in her hand.” Brian didn’t even get a chance to chime in as Sam spoke up. 

“Oh wow that’s so much proof! Thanks for believing your child mother!” Sofia turned around scolding her as Brian kept his eyes on the road. Sam turned her attention to Amber with anger in her eyes. “Snitches get stitches, hope you sleep with your eyes open.” 

“Hey!” Brian and Sofia both yelled simultaneously. Sam just punched Amber right in the face. Amber unlocked her seat belt as she launched at her sister scratching her arm. The car quickly pulled off the road as Sofia Sam off her sister. “What the fuck is wrong with you?!” Sam just wanted to scream into her mother’s face. 

“What the fuck is wrong with me? What the fuck is wrong with you?” Brian and Sofia both scoffed at her words. Sam pushed her mother off of her as she grabbed the seat in front of her trashing it. “Why don’t you tell Brian what you do in the backyard and you think no one is looking?” Sofia quickly covered Sam’s mouth as she picked her up out of the car. Sam bit her hand, dropping her to the floor. Sam circled the car running from her mom. “There's a hole in the backyard under the tree where mom buries cigarettes so no one knows she smokes.” Sofia finally got a hold of her as she spanked her on the hood of the car. “Ahhh! I wasn’t smoking, I swear!” Brian just sat quietly gripping the steering wheel. 

“Sofia, if I dig under the tree am I gonna find anything?” His question stopped Sofia mid spank. Sam crawled away as she pulled out her phone quickly calling someone. Sofia threatened Sam as she circled the car. Amber just curled in hiding her eyes from the drama. 

“Who are you calling? Give me that phone!” Sam stayed on the opposite side of her mom as she continued her call. 

“Sofia!” Brian leaned out his window grabbing Sofia's attention. “Have you been smoking? Are there cigarettes under the tree?” Cars zoomed past on the highway. Sofia turned to Brian with a face of weakness. Sam stayed on the phone as minutes passed. Brian climbed out of the car as he kept eye contact with Sofia. Sofia just slowly circled the car trying to get away from Brian and closer to Sam. As she got in reach of Sam she launched for her. Sam jumped back on her feet as a car cut in between them. Doge’s truck cut the distance between them. Sam ran to Doge hugging her as she got out. 

“I'm sorry Mommy, I promise I wasn't smoking don't hit me.” Sam pleaded as Doge held her tight. Doge turned to Sofia with angry eyes.

“Have you been hitting our daughter for something she didn't do?” Doge’s words were quickly interpreted by Brian's. 

“How long have you been smoking?” Sofia felt trapped in the middle. She had to defend her actions.

“She said the F word twice to me!” Sofia said, pointi at Sam. Sam just gripped Doge tight. 

“I'm sorry for cussing, please don't hit me again, I was mad because you weren't listening to me.” Sam played the victim well. Doge definitely picked a side. 

“So you pulled over the car and hit her.” Doge wanted answers. Sofia wanted to explode. Cars started honking and stopping to make sure everything was ok. Everything was not ok. Sofia just grabbed her head trying to stop a pounding incoming headache. Amber just sat quietly covering her ears. This was one of the first times she heard her father yell. 

“Ok! I'm sorry! I should have listened to you!” Sofia turned to her daughter. “I'm sorry for hitting you!” Sofia turned on her feet away from Doge and Sam. Sofia just broke down on the side of the highway. “I'm such a bad mother!” Tears formed on her face running down adding to the soil. “And I don't communicate with my wife or my friends, I just sneak a cigarette behind my house.” Brian just walked over to her. He peered down at her on her knees. 

“You done?” Sofia just wiped her face as Brian tried to get her onto her feet. “I'm sorry for raising my voice, just stop hiding things, if you're gonna smoke tell us.” Brian hugged her tight. Sofia turned back to her family.

“Who's cigarette was that?” Sam pulled off of Doge as she pushed her fingers together. “I'm not mad anymore, I shouldn't have yelled, or hit you, now you're not in trouble.” 

“I can't disclose that information.” Sam stood her ground while Doge rubbed Sam's back. Sofia just shrugged and followed them to the truck. As Brian climbed into the minivan he glanced at Amber in the mirror. He turned around quickly as he noticed blood dripping down her face. 

“Oh this is bad,” Brian said, pulling on his seat belt. Both car rides were practically silent. Only little murmurs eked out of their mouths. As the cars pulled up to the house Amber rushed out in a panic. Brian tried to play defense but she pushed him aside. As Amber pulled open the door she gasped.

“What happened to your face?” Amber didn't know how to respond to her daughter's face. Amber just wiped blood onto her arm as she grabbed her backpack. 

“S-s-sam hit me.” Rage turned Amber around as she spotted Sam leaving the truck. As Amber marched over Sam hit behind her parents.

“I'm sorry!” The girl screamed. Amber couldn't control herself. She wanted to snatch that child up by her throat. 

“Oh the things I could….how would you feel if I…..” Amber could feel the strange tension in the air but that didn't stop her. “I don't know who you think you are but no one hurts my child!” Amber's stern and angry voice almost brought Sam to tears as she bolted inside. Sofia and Doge just glanced at each other before heading inside. Amber quickly pushed Brian out of the way as she picked her daughter up carrying her to the bathroom. Sam was full of emotion and had to let it all out into her pillow. She just cried and cried. Her phone buzzed. James was making sure she was ok. She was not. 

-You have to tell my mom it was your cigarette-
-Sam-

There was no response. He ignored her message for a moment.

-You didn't rat me out?-
-James-

Of course she didn't. Dems the rules around here. She pleaded with him.

-No way my dad will kill me-
-James-

His words crushed her soul. She ached and cried. 

-Then I don't ever want to see you again-
-Sam-

And like that she blocked his number. Sam just curled up in bed using her pillow as a tissue. Soon the door opened as she used her tissue as a projectile.

“I hate you! Don't ever talk to me again!” Amber used the door as a shield as she took in the spiteful words. Amber could feel her body falling apart as she closed the door behind her. ",1,1742016334.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I'm planning to buy the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser with Niacinamide and the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion for my skincare routine. This is my first time trying them, and I want to be careful, especially since I have sensitive skin. I don’t even use razors because I get rashes when I do, so I stick to using a trimmer. I’m thinking of using a small amount of the niacinamide to test how it reacts to my skin, particularly for my pores and dark circles.

I’ve also heard good things about using coffee cream for under-eye dark circles. Any recommendations on that?

I’m considering buying from Amazon, but I’ve had mixed experiences with Nykaa (not offering COD, so I’m a bit skeptical). Could you suggest where I can buy these products online with COD or good customer support?

Thanks in advance

1jbnz6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jbnz6j/i_need_help_navigating_a_workplace_friendship/,I need help navigating a workplace friendship,"Hey Reddit. I don't usually come on here for advice but I feel I have nowhere else to turn because I don't want to compromise my situation, and feel it would be inappropriate to vent to other mutual friends. 

I (29F) had recently moved town and made some new friends. At work I felt comfortable with the friendship I had made with my close coworker (45M) due to similar personalities and working backgrounds. Let's name him K.  
Recently I was struggling with my mental health and decided to apply for an ADHD diagnosis, as I feel this has been a life-long issue. My diagnosis requires a statement from a close friend/coworker that sees how I function day-to-day and I chose my coworker to vouch for me. K has been diagnosed with ADHD so I felt with how supportive he has been, and his experience he would give me some good insight. I started to see him as a mentor figure with how grounded he appeared and I opened up a lot to him about my life.

Fast forward one month, we have hung out a few times outside of work (grabbed coffee etc.). I have seen nothing wrong with this as I have had much older platonic friends before. However, K has mentioned multiple times that he has not informed his wife of us hanging out and it's made me feel very uncomfortable. He has also bought things for me and told me not to tell anyone. He had dropped this like a guilty conscience a few times, and I figured because I don't want our hangouts to become inappropriate from his side, I have declined future public hangouts  (only hosting at his while his wife is home) and have decided to distance myself a little.

K has become uncomfortable with me suddenly pulling back, I have slowed down with answering texts and become less responsive. At midnight last night he sent me a long-winded message about me triggering his core wounds with becoming unresponsive and that he still wants to help me. I have informed him to back off and reminded him of my personal boundaries and that he needs to respect them. For now, we have left it there, but I have become uncomfortable with how needy he has suddenly become over the last few weeks, and I don't want to feel responsible for how he feels. I have told him that now it feels like I'm walking on eggshells to keep the peace.

Is there any way we can come to a neutral standpoint? I have come so far with developing a connection with K as he will help me with my diagnosis, but at the same time, I am feeling overwhelmed with the expectations he has put on me to be responsive 24/7 to him, where I prefer to withdraw and have my own space. 

Any help is much appreciated!

Cleaning a shrimp generally means that you split open the back with a sharp knife and remove that black line.

But shrimp shit isn't at all like human shit. Calling it ""shit"" is purposeful hostile language people use to justify their opinions. Shrimp shit is a mix of even tinier sealife that make up a shrimp's diet, and algae. In other words, plants and other seafood. Shrimp ""shit"" doesn't even resemble human shit, so there's no intrinsic disgust reflex. Its totally fine and edible just like how lobsters were once considered cheap prison food that has now been reframed as an expensive delicacy, the semi-common pejorative that shrimp are basically ocean cockroaches is entirely a social construct. The same thing applies when people excoriate others for not deveining a shrimp before serving it.

When I make shrimp for myself, I don't clean that part out. Most of the time I don't even take the shell off, but it depends on the recipe. I would never get upset at someone who generously cooked for me if I find veined shrimp in my meal. If you're not looking for it, 99% of the time you won't even notice it. Its just that fancy chefs and cooking shows have made this into some kind of cooking crime that they need to draw attention to.

There are probably a very tiny number of people where they can't help but recoil in disgust at the thought of it. For these people, I get it, you have a reflexive reaction so its not your fault, devein away. But while I don't personally like the texture of accidentally biting into ocean grit, the vast majority of time there's so little of it that I hardly notice. For most people, you can easily ignore it. And f you don't like it, just brush it off and eat the shrimp. If you see shrimp with veins being served to you, shut up and eat it, or don't eat it and shut up anyways. Nobody needs to be called out for not deveining. If people can drink civet shit coffee and pay out the nose for it, then you can eat a microscopic amount of seafood and algae and not act like a 5 year old being forced fed brussel sprouts.",6,1742015626.0,The10thDentist,17,0.67,False

In Factorio, I love watching the bots fly all over the place as well as the trains chugging around, and in Satisfactory, I love watching the trains run.. but I just can't bring myself to use vehicles :(.

The main reason, at least to me, is that they need fuel, and not an amount to scoff at either - if your route doesn't have coal or oil along the path / part of the supply chain, it's a painstaking process to get fuel over, and if it \*does\*, the fuel consumption of the tractor/truck eat enough of the coal/oil supplied that it becomes unattractive quickly. While drones are a cool option, they're just vastly outclassed by trains because they cost even more fuel for significantly less throughput.

I would totally get way more into the vehicles if there was just an option to electrically power them - there's a really awesome feeling watching vehicles run around that's worth it in factory games. This is why I built a worldwide highway.. for trains. No vehicles, just for trains.

Please Coffee Stain, I beg of you for electric vehicles. I don't care if they're a tier 7 unlock or beyond, I just yearn for them ;-;

1jbnoa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jbnoa3/under_a_blue_sky/,Under a blue sky,"Testing out a concept that I'm playing around with. Not yet a project, but the kernel of one.

\----------------------------------------------

*I have never seen a bluer sky in my life.*

That was the first thought to cross my mind as I stared out at the endless blue. The second was that I was dead—or close enough that the distinction may not have mattered. With my heart thumping in my chest it was hard to believe, but I really should have been dead.

Rain. Slick roads. Exhausted from back-to-back projects. Trying to make my next appointment. Going just a little too fast, the coffee too weak, the car sluggish. Or maybe I had been sluggish. Five weeks with no downtime will do that.

My last memories: the approaching curve, the car slipping on the wet road, then the headlights of what I assumed was a truck—the noise, the jolt, closing my eyes, readying for the inevitable.

The only truly amazing thing was that it hadn’t happened sooner.

Then I awoke and saw the sky.

The vista greeting me from atop the absurdly tall hill was nothing short of breathtaking.

\[WELCOME\]

There was a message floating in midair, just in front of me. The text followed the movements of my head, remaining firmly affixed in the same position.

*Huh, neat. Heaven’s digitised nowadays.*

It crossed my mind that I probably should have been reacting differently. Have a little panic attack, wave my arms, scream… that sort of thing.

I could remember everything up to the flash of headlights that I knew I couldn’t avoid, but not the pain that should have followed. Wasn’t there a study saying that we block traumatic memories?

I should have been freaking out. Bright light. Waking in a meadow—or on a green hill, as the case might be. Sense of calm. Wasn’t this how it was supposed to go?

But if I was dead, why freak out? Done and done. Couldn’t say I lost much of a life and I had a hard time caring.

And if I was in the process of dying in the contorted ruins of my Ford Focus, and that green pastoral view was my brain’s coping mechanism, I was fine with it. I could have felt much worse.

That was neat thought, though. I *could* have felt *far* worse. But the weather was pleasantly warm, the air crisp and fresh, and nothing hurt at all. All in all, I was finding it hard to muster up the anger.

The welcome message was annoying though.

“Hi,” I said, giving a small wave at the air. I wanted to swat it away from my face.

\[ARE YOU COMFORTABLE?\]

Well, that was a hell of a question. I wasn’t feeling any worse for wear. A few experimental pats revealed no aches or pains—not even the old stiffness I got saddled with on that winter project working sub-zero for weeks. I felt fine—better than fine even.

At that moment I was feeling amazing.

“Yes,” I replied, not sure what else to say.

\[I AM ETERNITY\]

\[I WELCOME YOU\]

\[INTERFACE WILL MANIFEST MOMENTARILY\]

\[THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE\]

The text flashed several times, then vanished without a trace. I can’t say I had much reaction. It was the kind of whackadoodle experience I always figured you’d get when your head served as a truck’s hood ornament.

I stood and turned, taking in the full scenery.

Above was the bluest sky I’d ever seen, despite a few scattered clusters of clouds. They resembled cotton, drifting high above a world of pure, raw green. Blue mountains lined one edge of the horizon. On another side, some twisted structure crawled up from a crater in the earth, barely visible at the farthest point to my right, a mess of interlocking elements too far out to make out in detail.

Forests of silver-leafed trees—yes, silver—lay straight ahead, just at the bottom of my hill. And on the other side was a sparkling stretch of water extending to the horizon, with a tower scratching the sky beyond.

And I mean that literally. The thing looked like it extended into… space…

I gaped at the sight *above* the tower: a planet hung in the sky, half-visible,  dominating the entire view. A marble of blue and green, like Earth, with strange landmasses covering its surface. An alien world, just hovering there.

“That’s something…” I said to no one, just staring up, mouth agape.

I felt as though I could head there. If I got closer and reached out, I maybe could even touch it. I didn’t know where that certainty came from, but I was as sure of it as of how to shift gears in my car.

A settlement rose among the fields, homes nestled in the hollows between the near hills and valley. It was distant, but definitely some kind of village or town with red-roofed buildings clustering around a snaking river.

I blinked several times, surprised of the details I could make out in the distance. My eyes have been terrible ever since I was ten years old, yet now I could see better than I ever did with glasses. Made sense, I guess—if I was going to hallucinate vividly, I may as well hallucinate myself in better shape than real life.

Near to where I *awoke*—really, just a patch of grass flattened by my sitting—a sword stuck out of the ground, its blade shimmering blue. With no one else around, and a scabbard knocking against my trouser leg, I could only assume the sword is meant for me.

Much less *in tune* with the picturesque sights were my clothes. I was wearing scuffed jeans and a t-shirt—my ancient Nightwish one—with metal-toed work boots. My old proofs, scuffed, spattered, and survivors of at least a hundred events that would have taken my toes off.

Neat.

“Hello?” I tried again.

I wasn’t sure what an *interface* should look like or what I should be doing while I waited. No other message appeared. For lack of anything else to do, I headed down the hill and wrapped my fingers around the sword’s hilt.

Feather light, the blade was a shimmering blue almost the colour of the sky. I rapped a knuckle against the blade, expecting some sort of plastic or glass, but it sounded like metal. I’d never heard of any steel that blue or light. A long, black metal spine held one side of the blade and connected to the hilt, giving the weapon some heft. How was it supposed to fit in a scabbard?

A quick check showed it would fit quite neatly actually: the scabbard had one side cut away, allowing for the blade to nestle easily within. Definitely not a classic sword.

I tested the edge on my thumbs. Blood welled up on the barest touch, revealing a razor-sharp edge that I could’ve shaved with.

\[YOUR INTERFACE TO ETERNITY IS READY\]

\[PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME\]

I almost reacted with the customary idiot “Uh”, but caught myself. The last thing I wanted was for my imaginary name to register as “Uh-Klaus”.

“Klaus,” I said loudly, not sure if it was requesting my last name.

\[KLAUS HAS BEEN LOGGED AS PREFERRED DESIGNATION\]

A wall of text flooded my view, hovering about a metre away from my face. So much random crap appears that it’s hard to keep track of or even understand it. Windows pop up, open, minimise, as if things are self-arranging. It goes on for nearly a minute before a single message remains.

\[INITIALISATION COMPLETE\]

\[INTEGRATION HOLDING STABLE\]

\[NAME: KLAUS\]

\[AGE: 23\]

Well, it got that wrong. I’d been thirty-eight when I had gotten out of bed in the morning, my birthday spent in a hotel room, then a plastic injection factory, then the road. Where was it getting twenty-three from?

\[SPECIES: HUMAN\]

The fact that was even a category suggested the existence of other species. I wasn’t sure what to make of that. Was I about to hallucinate some elves?

\[CLASS: UNASSIGNED\]

\[WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YOUR ATTRIBUTE SHEET?\]

“Like, in  a game? Sure, I guess.” The final moment of life hallucination was getting weird at this point, but I rolled with it. It was nice to see where my brain would go to prepare me for the end.

\[ATTRIBUTES CAN BE EXPANDED BASED ON PREFERENCE\]

\[CURRENT LIST IS CURATED FOR SIMPLICITY\]

\[LEVEL: 1\]

\[STRENGTH: 4\]

\[INTELLIGENCE: 7\]

\[CONSTITUTION: 2\]

\[WISDOM: 5\]

\[WILLPOWER: 3\]

\[POINTS TO ALLOCATE: 0\]

Exactly like a video game. I couldn’t help but wince at some of those ratings. Willpower only a three? Constitution a two? I hadn’t been—

I caught myself before getting into a huff. Truth of the matter was that I’d been a slob, eating in my car, living off cold gas-station sandwiches, getting fatter by the day, too stupid to recognise the problem in time or do something about it.

“What am I supposed to do?” I asked aloud, still trying to make sense of things. “What’s going on?”

\[LIFE MUST CONTINUE\]

\[PURPOSE, WHERE THERE IS NONE, MUST BE FOUND\]

\[LIVE\]

\[DIE\]

\[THE CHOICE CAN ONLY BE YOURS\]

Oh, that was just awesome. I was hallucinating a system dispensing fortune-cookie wisdom, projected straight to my retinas.

“Is this even real?” I asked, pointing the sword forward as though trying to drive the text away.

\[EVERYTHING IS REAL\]

\[NOTHING IS REAL\]

\[REALITY IS SELF-DEFINED\]

\[PURPOSE DEPENDS ON YOU\]

\[THIS WORLD DEPENDS ON YOU\]

\[ANSWER ITS CALL OR DO NOT\]

\[THE CHOICE IS YOURS\]

\[NO GODS\]

\[NO KINGS\]

\[NO MASTERS\]

\[ONLY TIME\]

I stared at those last four lines. *“No gods, no kings, no masters, only time.”* What an odd thing to get from an entity calling itself Eternity, speaking directly into my head. Wouldn’t that invalidate the very first line?

Though, the concept did appeal to me. If I were in a video game, then would’ve been the moment for a quest to pop up—something about killing wolves or rabbits for the promise of some reward. But this thing basically told me to fuck off and do… whatever. If that wasn’t ironic, I didn’t know what was.

With no clue what was expected of me or what to aim for, I sat in the grass and… thought.

“What’s this place called?” I asked, trying to sort out the questions crowding my head.

\[THIS WORLD IS DESIGNATED AS ORESSTRIA #2111\]

\[CURRENT POPULATION: 723.122.001\]

My eyebrows shot up at the number of people suggested. A tenth of Earth. Did that mean this was a smaller planet? But, at least I wasn’t alone. I could…

I frowned. What *could* I do actually?

If I was dead, what came next? It wasn’t as if I’d led some particularly interesting life. I spent a good fifteen years making my boss obscenely rich, ruining my personal life and health, and just existing in a perpetual state of exhaustion.

What came next?

“Why am I here?” I asked, hoping for guidance.

\[LIFE MUST CONTINUE\]

“So… have I… respawned or something? Reincarnated?”

\[NO\]

\[YOU HAVE NOT EXPIRED\]

\[RESURRECTION IS FORBIDDEN\]

Well, that was maddeningly unhelpful and cryptic.

“Are you sentient?”

I waited but got not answer. I guessed it hadn’t liked that one. Then again, it had been a loaded question.

Still, I was alive. How was resurrection forbidden if I was living proof of it? I recalled the moment straight before impact. I’d been doing a hundred and twenty. In the rain. On a winding road. There was no conceivable way in which I would have survived a front impact with a sixteen wheeler.

“Why did you resurrect *me* in particular? Does everyone get a second chance?” I was going to pick at its answers until I got one that actually meant something.

\[RESURRECTION IS IMPROPER TERM\]

\[RESURRECTION IS FORBIDDEN\]

“What’s the proper term, then?”

\[SELECTION\]

Aha—we were getting somewhere.

“Why me, in particular?”

Frustratingly, it refused to answer again. It wasn’t going to make things simple for me so I changed tacks.

“What do I call you?”

\[I AM ETERNITY\]

“Thank you, Eternity.” Some gratitude was in order. “I assume you’re responsible for me being here?”

\[YES\]

Progress! But the text floating in my sight was hard to focus on. I’d never been a fan of VR. I tended to slap myself in the face trying to move stuff around.

“Do you have a different way of communicating besides text?”

“Yes.”

*I swear to God* I nearly shat myself. The voice was right in my ear, vaguely female, a tad too loud. I dropped the sword in my scare. For a moment, I regretted my request if that was how it felt to be hearing disembodied voices.

“Tell me if I got this right” I said once I got back my dignity. Silence followed, expectant. “I died. I was brought here. There’s no set goal for me, and I have to find my own way. I must keep living. That’s all the instruction I’m going to get?”

“No. Yes. No and yes. Yes and yes,” the voice said.

Was it being intentionally obtuse just to frustrate me. “What are the ‘*no’s* then?”

“You have not died. There is a set goal for you.”

So I hadn’t understood anything correctly. “What is the goal?”

Silence.

I could have kept picking at that, but I was getting hungry and frustrated, a combination I knew from long experience would lead to me blowing my top off. Eternity or whoever was in charge of it, could go suck a lemon if it was going to be difficult.

Atop the hill I made my first choice.

Part of me wanted to head towards the sea for a closer look at that distant tower.

Another part was intrigued by the gargantuan twisted structure marring the far horizon.

But the only destination that made any sense was that village down there.

I had a crystalline sword and an annoying AI—assuming it even was an AI, though it could as easily be some jackass with a god complex—talking in riddles. The village seemed like it would offer a better chance of finding someone sane.

Dead or alive, I was under a blue sky, trudging through knee-high grass on an alien world. I felt a heavy stare on the nape of my neck, as if the planet above was turning to regard me. It was all nonsense, of course, so I ignored it, whistled an off-key tune, and set down the hill.

A breeze picked up, bringing with it the scent of lilac, cut grass, earth, and so much more. Honestly, I was reminded of my college days, back when I used to hike in the mountains with some regularity.

I expected the jaunt downhill to wear me out. I was nowhere near athletic for my age.. Yet my knees didn’t ache, my breathing was steady, and I managed the sword’s imbalance at my hip just fine. By the time I got halfway down the hill through the tall grass, I wasn’t even winded—or tired at all, for that matter.

My sheet said I was twenty-three. Had I been reverted to that age? If so, it must’ve been some ideal version of that age. I was much slimmer and fitter than I’d ever managed in life. Even in my early twenties I carried a paunch and got winded easily—too many video games, too much studying, and too few accepted invitations to step away from the computer and live a little.

I think hiking had been my only escape from being in front of a screen. Thinking back, I had to wonder why I had given it up so entirely.

Oddities aside, I wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth: I felt great. I could get used to not feeling like crap.

“Eternity, are you there?” I asked as more of the rolling vista stretched out before me.

“Your interface to Eternity is always active,” the voice replied. “You may communicate by speech or thought; it will be received.”

*Well, that’s neat. It would be nice to have some visual feedback though—maybe an avatar in the interface, something covering up part of my view. Or…*

“Can you… generate a hologram or something I can keep track of?” Not for nothing, but a disembodied voice following me around did not sit well with me.

I never liked Siri listening in for commands back home; I always found it creepy that I would say something, and my phone would answer from my pocket.

A blob of light appeared by my right shoulder, hovering roughly four hundred millimetres away from my head. It moved around as I did, keeping perfect distance and sync.

*Neat. Let’s see if I can push this little thing further. If it can be light, it can probably be other things too.*

“Can you shape your presence?” I asked. “Something like… uh…” I pause, considering who I’d want trailing me. Cortana maybe? I had a soft spot for sassy AIs and Eternity seemed to fit the bill.

Sure enough, the blob became a tiny silver-hued Cortana, floating in midair, modelled after the first Halo game—the one I actually played back in my misspent youth.

“Does this help put you at ease?” the avatar asked. It didn’t quite get the lip sync right.

“Much. But let’s try Syl this time, from Stormlight Archives.” Not for nothing, but Cortana just floating there, hands on hips, was still weird. A thought struck me. “Or no, no, wait. Mushu! Do Mushu!”

I was already impressed of how it reacted to my thoughts, and that it even knew who Cortana was. That it had insight into my mind—or my past, maybe?—wasn’t something I was overly worried over.

Normally, I would have found it creepy, but I was a dead guy on an alien world with a sword on my hip. I could handle a little creepy. The phone thing was the engineer in me aware of my privacy being trampled.

Eternity seemed to be some kind god-like AI—or even a god, now that I thought on it—with the power to whisk people away from certain death. It looking into my head was the least incredible thing about it.

Again, the avatar morphed into a perfect copy of the ancestral little dragon. It still kept away at a set distance, which was disconcerting. If I was going to have a companion shadowing me, I would’ve liked it to be at least lifelike. Without prompting, the avatar began moving, undulating through the air, like an actual miniature Chinese dragon.

“Yeah, that’s perfect,” I said.

Familiarity helped me keep calm in the face of all these changes. Over time, working too often alone, I had developed the unpleasant habit of talking to the gear around me. Robots. PLCs. My phone. The car. I didn’t need that continuing here, for however long this episode was to last.

With that settled, I continued down the hill, forging a path through tall grass. Nettles scratched at my jeans, their flowers in full bloom, smelling amazing. I couldn’t recall the last time I stood in a green field just being there, taking in the moment.

Eh, deadlines—always deadlines. Always late by five damn minutes. Always heading to the next emergency, I barely had time to exist outside of work. The never-ending cycle of house plants in my apartment spoke volumes of my lack of connection to nature.

The village and river weren’t getting any closer. At my pace, given the distance and lack of a real path, I expected at least a few hours of hiking to reach the place. Not too bad. And I still wasn’t out of breath, so I increased the pace.

Temptation nagged at me to poke around Eternity’s interface, though I resisted the urge. Any moment, my soon-to-be corpse would run out of juice—morbid, I know—and the whole experience would end. In that eventuality, I wanted to be in the moment, not absorbed in menus. I had done enough of that in life.

“You are not dead,” Eternity said by my ear, maintaining its monotone. “Nor are you dying.”

“Uh-huh,” I replied. “That’s exactly what I’d say if I wanted to deny reality.”

“Everything is real, and nothing is. Reality is self-defined.”

“So if I thought really hard that I’m dying, I’d be dying?”

“A single, unaltered mortal mind does not possess sufficient processing capacity to visualise change on a large enough scale to affect objective reality outside its subjective state. Ergo, you are not dying.”

Had the AI just snapped at me? And what did that even mean? If I understood it, a sufficiently powerful mind could potentially alter reality to suit its vision? Asimov would have been proud to hear it.

I wanted to keep probing and challenging the concept, but I wasn’t ready to accept reality as permanent. So I kept walking, trying not to think about anything that might spoil the moment. Alive or dead—what did it matter? I was there, and if that breathtaking scenery was the last thing I ever saw, I would at least bask in it.

Eternity coiled through the air behind me, sullen and annoyed. I could feel a shift in its mood, like a ghostly echo of an annoyance. By all rights, I was the one that should have been annoyed, being dead and all.

*How aren’t I raving mad right now?* The inconsistency kept nagging at me. I was good at bottling in my feelings, but this good? It was a bit worrisome actually.

The world stretched before me. The farther I walked, the more details I picked up, near and far. Copses of trees dotted the land, and the river bent and twisted through the scenery. Square fields cut across the distance, their shade a distinct green against the silver of the forests. A small orchard stood atop a hill by the village, the trees in neat rows, too orderly to be natural. There was life out there, and I was curious what kind it was, given the “species” tab in my character sheet.

I approached one of the copses—the trees tall and thin, with long pale leaves that reminded me of willows. They encircle a pond of clear water, softly swaying in the breeze. From the tall grass, a few bird heads poked out, but they kept their distance. The ones nearest me took off in the opposite direction avoiding me.

With the sun high overhead and the walk, thirst scratched at my throat.

The face staring back at me from the pool of clear water was one I hadn’t seen in at least fifteen years—exactly as I looked in my early twenties, minus a few kilos.

I looked like a slimmer version of my twenty-year-old self, only missing the scar on my right cheek—my badge of “good childhood behaviour” after I’d fallen off my bike. It was strange not seeing it in the reflection.

Otherwise, everything else was there—blue eyes, crooked nose, full head of black hair—that was a shock, considering I’d grown halfway bald in my thirties. No stubble yet; I had trouble growing a beard back then.

“Is the water safe to drink?” I asked Eternity as the avatar settled on my shoulder.

“It is within acceptable purity thresholds for your species,” it answered.

That didn’t tell me much, but I drank anyway, relieved to get something into my stomach. I was fairly sure Eternity hadn’t bothered grabbing the cold chicken sandwich I had in the car with me before the accident. My stomach gurgled, but it would get fed once I found something that wasn’t mechanical bird.

I had three things crowding for attention in my mind:

First, I wanted… no, I needed more information from Eternity. Whatever it wanted, there must be a way around its silence. Whatever kept it from telling me more could be circumvented, I was sure of it. Running into dangerous man-eating birds—I may be exaggerating—had a way of making me consider the stakes of my presence there.

Second, a new tab was flashing in my vision: \[SKILLS\]. It was as annoying as the first welcome message, but I wasn’t going to dive in without more information first.

Third, I wanted to reach that village. If there were more of those birds around, I would’ve liked to steer clear of them. For all I knew, I could’ve just slaughtered a farmer’s livestock, which could lead to very awkward conversations.

*No, sir, really, I thought I was in a video game. That’s why I went around murder-hoboing your livestock. Sorry—I didn’t realize your family would starve this winter.*

Right. First things first.

“Eternity,” I said, settling in the shade to choose my next words.

“Yes?” it answered.

“What happens if I just sit here and never move again?”

“You would eventually succumb to starvation and exposure.”

I walked myself into that one. A quick reassertion later, I tried again, “Let’s say I decided to eat those birds.”

“Squawker meat is inedible for humans. Animal products harvested from glitch-artefacts do not provide nourishment.”

Well, that was something. I filed away the concept of “glitch-artefacts” for later.

“Let’s assume I find suitable food, I have water and shelter, and I decide not to budge. Then what happens?” If there was one thing I learned from dealing with stubborn LLMs over the past couple of years, it’s that the best approach is sometimes a completely off-the-wall direction.

Eternity wouldn’t tell me directly what I wanted to know, so I was going to try and piece it together from other vaguely related bits.

“After enough stagnation, your interface to Eternity would be disconnected,” it said.

“So I’d be killed?”

“No. Life must continue.”

“Then would I be returned to where you found me?”

“No. That would ensure your fatality. Life must continue.”

“So I’d just be left here, fending for myself?” Seems a bit cruel.

“In your hypothetical, you have food, water, and shelter—enough for self-sufficiency. It is your choice to stop. Your choice would be respected. Another candidate would be selected.”

So, if I refused my task someone else would be brought in to do it. This would be a cycle. That wasn’t a lot to go on, but it did confirm there was a task that needed doing, and I might have been brought in to clear someone else’s mess.

Why wouldn’t Eternity just straight up say what that was?

I recall its earlier words: “No gods, no kings, no masters, only time.” Something I should note. Whatever Eternity was, it didn’t force me to do anything—just expected I’d stumble onto the job.

That seemed like poor design to get anything accomplished.

The fact that it didn’t promise anything also felt odd. It had brought me there for something, but it wouldn’t demand it of me. Why?

“Will the next person’s job be more dangerous than mine?” I continued my questioning.

“Possibly.”

“Depending on what?”

“Time.”

I expected it to depend on what the next person is—maybe another human, maybe something else. But from this, I gathered that inaction would lead to more danger. Sure, it was a leap, but it fit.

""How will it be more dangerous?"" I tried to press.

Silence answered.

But , I had enough to go on for a time. There was a job to do. If I didn’t do it within a particular time frame, something bad would happen.

“Are you the danger, Eternity?” I asked, not expecting much.

I never would’ve guessed its answer.

“I am that which is in danger,” Eternity said in its usual flat tone.

Food for thought. It could have mentioned that sooner.

*Hello, human. I’m a weird AI in danger. Please help.*

It couldn’t be that hard to state the premise up front. Why the secrecy? I’d figure it out eventually, but for now it sufficed.

Now, about those skills. I gained one earlier, but I saw no direct way to use or access it. My interface only showed two tabs in the bottom right: \[STATS\] and \[SKILLS\], nothing else.

“Uh… how do I view my skills?” I asked.

Eternity didn’t miss a beat. “Focus on the tab you want opened.”

I did—and holy fuck!

I staggered back from the burst of text filling my vision. It was so zoomed out that the words were minuscule, unreadable even at a squint.

My skill selection looked like a flower of branching paths—an eight-petal flower, in fact. Four petals were large and arranged in a cross shape, while the other four were shorter but wider, filling in the gaps between. I willed the entire assembly to zoom in on its centre.

Now it was clearer. Four main categories, with four secondary ones in between. Clockwise, they read: \[PHYSICAL\], \[ARTISAN\], \[MAGIC\], \[ALTERATION\], \[STEALTH\], \[SURVIVAL\], \[TRAVERSAL\], and \[PATHFINDING\].

There were tons of skills listed, each with a few starting nodes branching out. I didn’t bother reading them all yet. Instead, I focused on \[PHYSICAL\], since it was the only one lit up. Its starting nodes were aptitude skills—swords, staves, bows, axes, and more—implying I could learn to wield whichever I liked best.

“Okay, that’s a bit much,” I groaned, mentally scrolling. Beyond the first level of the branches, everything was blurred, as if the interface wouldn’t let me see yet.

There was also magic…

I was thrown by the notion of magic being there. Could I… toss fireballs around? Would I even want to? Was this Tolkien-level magic, with minimal rules? Or some modern system operating like a game?

I resisted the urge to peek further.

Thing was, I liked the idea of magic, but hated “guess the formula” game magic. If this was some bullshit “technology so advanced” then I didn’t want anything to do with it. Magic, for me, needed to be raw, complex, and unmanageable, a force of the universe with its own goals and agenda.

If it could be distilled into a “skill”, then it was boring.

This world still felt whimsical, and until it sunk in that I was here for the long haul—or that I was just vividly hallucinating—I would have rather not delved too deep into this particular subject. I could lose days in that menu.

I knew how easily I could obsess over systems.

However, I did check out my sword skill. I focused on that node and mentally requested an explanation:

\[YOU HAVE LEARNED WHICH END OF A SWORD IS MEANT FOR THE ENEMY\]

That was it. There was no other part of the explanation available.

“Are you taking the piss?” I said, blinking at the nonsense. “Eternity, are you for real?”

“Everything is real. Nothing is real. Reality is self-defined,” the silver tiny dragon replied, as though trying to annoy me on purpose.

I debated getting angry but decided against it—at least until I knew more. If Eternity was some troll controlling everything, I’d eventually learn and deliver my anger properly. No point wasting it now.

I drew my sword again, checking for changes. I’d always known which end goes where—hilt to me, point to the enemy—so it was hardly complicated maths. But something did feel different. The blade settled better in my hands, less awkward to grip, more familiar. Maybe it was just confirmation bias. After killing three squawkers, I could simply felt more comfortable with a weapon.

Maybe that was how I earned the skill to begin with—a notification that I was slightly less terrible with a sword.

The second skill, Heavy Blow, is just as impenetrable as the first.

\[DELIVER A POWERFUL BLOW THAT STAGGERS AND PUSHES BACK YOUR ENEMY\]

That was nice and all, but it said nothing of how to use the thing, if it had a cost, or if it quantified what “powerful blow” meant. Vibes. The system was giving me vibes.

I stopped myself from overthinking. Like everything else, I shelved it for later. I kept trying not to add an “if there is a later” to the end of all my thoughts. Eventually, I may have to accept everything was real—and then I’d have plenty of reacting to do.

Up to that moment, I focused on seeing what that village held and what sort of people might be living there. If they all acted like Eternity, at least I’d know then this was a mad land, and it was happening in my head. I hadn’t seen any white rabbits yet, but I could just as easily assume myself an uglier Alice in Wonderland.

I took one last drink of cool water and set off downhill. The slope gave me clear view of the village and its surrounding hills. I could even make out a snaking road leading to it. If I got lost, I could still follow the river downstream.

A few more of those squawkers clustered in groups of three or four, dispersed through the tall grass. I gave them a wide berth. If three attacked me at once, I wasn’t sure I could survive. One? Maybe. Two? Risky. Three? Likely a smashed skull. No thank you.

A part of me kept whispering, “But levels, skills, loot…” With the skill flower in mind, it was easy to slip into game logic: kill starter mobs, level up, reach the first town, pick up a cheesy starter quest—probably involving stolen or lost cheese wheels—get a better weapon, rinse, repeat.

But a more sensible part pointed out that a fantasy prison would probably suck—especially the bucket-for-a-toilet scenario.

Something shifted as I stumble down the hill. It was in the air—like the faint smoke of a chilly autumn evening. Not exactly wrong, but it didn’t feel exactly right either. The closer I got to the village, the more odd details stood out.

Among the whitewashed buildings, several stood a shade darker than the rest. Some of the field were withered. Some were a faded green, far different from the rest. Pockets of gnarled, withered trees dotted the orchard, their dead branches contrasting with the silver leaves of the rest.

It might have been nothing, but something in the back of my head suggested otherwise.

The village itself, at first glance, was not much different from my grandparents’ village in my youth—yet something was off. No place would be perfectly idyllic, but this wasn’t just disrepair or neglect.

It hit me suddenly that the feeling of wrongness wasn’t mine. The same way I’d been feeling Eternity’s displeasure earlier, I was now feeling its worry. Or something akin to that. The closer I got to the village, the more intense the feeling.

I finally spotted other people. From afar, they were just specks on the main road or out in the fields and orchard. But they were definitely there, moving about, doing the chores of the day.

Hopefully, they weren’t going to greet me with torches and pitchforks when I emerged from the tall grass onto a dirt road winding downhill like the river. Better to appear as a traveller on the road than crawling out of the undergrowth.

What felt like hours later, as I approached the tall fence surrounding the village, I became pretty sure my name was Alice now.

I never touched drugs in my life. I wasn’t a *fun* youth, didn’t even like drinking too much, much less anything more intense.

At that moment, standing in the middle of the road, staring at the sight, I really wondered if Eternity could have doused me with something. LSD, maybe?

Because the sight could either be from a sever concussion, or from drugs. I was not ready to accept *this* as reality.",1,1742014743.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Ensure that all heating equipment is properly installed and maintained, and that you have clear safety guidelines in place for both staff and customers. Consider weatherproof patio heaters for exposed locations. Also, look into patio heater regulations.*   **Considering Aesthetics:** Your heating equipment should complement the overall aesthetic of your patio space. Choose heaters that are stylish and visually appealing, and that blend seamlessly with your existing décor.
* **Patio Heater Rentals for Businesses**: Short term considerations of a commercial outdoor space may benefit from renting patio heaters for restaurants, cafes, and bars. Event planning or a one-time event could find this beneficial.

### Optimizing for Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness

While customer comfort is paramount, it's also crucial to consider the cost of operating your heated patio. here are a few tips for maximizing efficiency and minimizing operating costs:

*   **Choose Energy-Efficient Heaters:** Opt for heaters that are designed for energy efficiency. Infrared heaters, such as, are generally more efficient than propane heaters becuase they directly heat objects and people rather than the air around them.
*   **Use smart Controls:** Invest in smart controls that allow you to adjust the temperature and heating levels based on occupancy and weather conditions. This can help you avoid wasting energy by heating empty areas or overheating the space.
*   **Insulate Your Patio:** Consider adding windbreaks, screens, or other forms of insulation to your patio to help retain heat. This can significantly reduce your heating costs and improve customer comfort.
*   **Offer Blankets or Throws:** Provide customers with complimentary blankets or throws to help them stay warm and cozy. This is a simple and cost-effective way to enhance their experience and reduce their reliance on the heaters.

### Addressing Concerns About Safety and Regulations

Operating a heated patio comes with certain safety and regulatory considerations that you need to address:

*   **Fire Safety:** Ensure that all heating equipment is properly installed and maintained, and that you have appropriate fire extinguishers on hand. Train your staff on fire safety procedures.
*   **Ventilation:** If using propane or natural gas heaters, ensure that your patio is adequately ventilated to prevent the buildup of carbon monoxide.
*   **Accessibility:** Make sure that your heated patio is accessible to people with disabilities. This includes providing accessible seating and ensuring that pathways are clear of obstructions.Commercial outdoor heating solutions must consider all aspects of accessibility.
*   **Local Regulations:** Familiarize yourself with all local regulations regarding outdoor heating, including permitting requirements, fire codes, and noise restrictions.Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines or other penalties.

### The Future of Heated Patios: Trends and Innovations

The world of heated patios is constantly evolving, with new technologies and innovations emerging all the time. Here are a few trends to watch out for:

*   **Smart Heating Systems:** Smart heating systems that use sensors and algorithms to automatically adjust the temperature and heating levels based on occupancy and weather conditions are becoming increasingly popular.
*   **Sustainable Heating Solutions:** As concerns about climate change grow, there is increasing demand for sustainable heating solutions that minimize environmental impact.
*   **Aesthetic Integration:** New designs are blending heaters into the patio design so the fixtures are not obtrusive.*   **Outdoor Dining Igloos**: These provide an individual room outdoors for a unique dining experience.

By staying informed about these trends and innovations, you can ensure that your heated patio remains competitive and appealing to customers.

1jbnm4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jbnm4h/fumbled_a_shy_guy_help/,Fumbled a shy guy- help?,"i (19f) took a bit of a break from dating, but my last talking stage made me realise just how much i miss it—the late night chats, the playful “i miss you more” back and forth, all of it.

there’s this guy, J in my class who is exactly my type—tall, brown hair, glasses, goes to the gym. he actually asked me out once, but he was so subtle abt it that i completely missed what he was getting at and (like an idiot) said no. now i wanna see if something could happen between us.

so, my questions are:
	1.	do i just ask him out myself? casually mention i’d be up for it if he asked again? or is there a better way to go abt this?
	2.	if we do end up going on a date, what should i keep in mind? it’s been ages, and i’m kinda nervous.
	3.	i don’t think convo will be an issue since we’ve got loads in common, but he can be a bit shy. how do i help him feel more at ease around me?

for context: we’re both med students, obsessed w coffee, horse riding, classic books, and rock music (arctic monkeys, nbhd, tame impala, 1975, cage the elephant etc). he’s honestly adorable, and i really wanna do this right.

tldr: there’s a shy guy in my class i’m very into. he asked me out once, but he was too subtle and i didn’t realise. now i wanna show i’m interested, figure out how to handle a first date after ages out of the game. how do i go abt it?",1,1742014528.0,dating_advice,7,0.67,False

1jbnkja,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jbnkja/navigating_financial_gap/,Navigating Financial Gap,"Hii! My (25F) boyfriend (28M) makes significantly more than I do. I make like <35k a year and he makes >400k. I’m a barista and an artist, and he’s a business owner. We met at a metal show where I thought he was super cute so I tapped him on the shoulder and struck up conversation. 

He does a fantastic job at reassuring me that he doesn’t see me as lesser than, or think I’m a loser, because of how much money I make. 

I often still feel this way though; especially because he pays for everything whenever we go out! I like to contribute and I’m used to being independent. (Used to pay for my ex’s groceries even if it put me in the negatives because that ex made less than I did.)
Sometimes I try to buy my bf and I our drinks or our coffee, but I already have so little after bills that it always takes a decent chunk out of my bank account lol. It’s hard because I want to treat him well in the same way he treats me. 
I told him I missed the beach and he flew him and I to Cancun for Valentine’s Day, as an example of how he treats me. 

My bf sometimes has anxiety that I’m only with him for his money. Anytime he’s brought it up he says he’s not actually worried about it, he just thinks I’m way out of his league. But I look at him and think he is so handsome and I love him down to his heart and soul. So, I try not to stress about it since I’m already very low maintenance when it comes to going out / spending money, and my love language is quality time so I just like to be around him. I want to think of things that don’t involve spending money on him to show him my love. (I loveeee gift giving.)
I feel like finding other sweet things to do with him will reassure him that I look at him without the lens of how much he makes. 
We’ll be doing lots of hiking this summer, and other fun things outside as well which is at the forefront of my brain for upcoming dates that I can plan for us. He’s new to my state and I want to show him my favorite spots. 

Here’s what I’ve done gift-wise… I’ve already made him a painting and some cute cards. I wrote him a poem. I offer to give him massages since his love language is also physical touch. Also I’ve made him a playlist. Help haha, I feel like I need more ideas because I WANT to do more for him. 


TLDR; my bf makes literally 10x more than I do. How can I show my love for my boyfriend without spending money, since I can’t afford the high quality things he likes? And also, how can I contribute to him more in the relationship when he pays for everything on our dates?

additional info: I’ve been job searching for 6 months and cannottttt score a job for the life of me. I used to be a manager at a previous shop and made a lot more money, but haven’t had the opportunity to move up at this current job (been there for two years). I got my associates degree but that hasn’t helped me one bit either. It’s rough out here yall. If anyone has any tips on how to score a remote job with minimal experience that would be fantastic.

1jbneg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/1jbneg9/i_hate_everything_about_my_university_rant/,I hate everything about my university (Rant)!,"**I wish I had gone to Western University.**

In high school, it came down to a final choice between Western University and Ryerson (now TMU). I really wanted to go to Western, but some family members had gone to Ryerson, and the financial strain of living in residence at Western was more than my parents could afford. So, I was pressured into choosing Ryerson.

I'm currently in the TMU Finance Co-op program as a third-year student. I didn’t get AEO for Western and was denied admission to the HBA program. I also applied to UBC Sauder as a third-year transfer this year but was rejected. However, I was accepted to UBCO — but I’m not going. I hate my university.

I'm frustrated. My daily commute is over 2.5 hours, and I feel completely disconnected from campus life. Despite everything, I’m actively involved in extracurriculars, networking events, and investment clubs. The problem is, I want to work in Capital Markets in the U.S., and target business schools have a strong pipeline for that. Coming from a non-target school makes networking for consulting and capital markets opportunities so much harder. No matter how many coffee chats, workshops, and networking events I attend, it feels like all the real opportunities go to target school students because their alumni network is 10x stronger.

My friends who went to Western are having a great time. Meanwhile, I’m a commuter at a commuter school. What makes it worse is that I barely have time to hang around after class because I have to catch the GO train. My commute is brutal: I have to wake up at 6:00 a.m., leave my house by 6:45, drive 15 minutes to the GO station, and take the GO train to Union. From there, I take Line 1 Train to Yonge and Dundas and walk five minutes to class — all to make it to my 8:10 a.m. class. If I wake up even 10 minutes late, I’ll miss the GO train and have to wait another 30 minutes, which disrupts my entire schedule. It’s even worse during finals when I spend three hours commuting just for a two-hour exam. The struggle is real.

Looking back, I regret not having more options. I don’t come from a wealthy family, and being stuck at home sucks.

I'm tired of getting rejected for capital markets and top-tier internship opportunities. It feels like as soon as they see my resume from a non-target school, I’m automatically counted out. Most of the opportunities go to students from UofT, UBC, McGill, Queen’s, and Western. I regret not applying to Queen’s Commerce in high school.

I’m frustrated. I know I can’t change the past, but I’m trying to figure out what to do going forward.

I definitely want to do my MBA at a top U.S. school down the line. But right now, I hate my life as a student. It feels like it's filled with regret, frustration, and hardship.

I have two years left since I’m taking university at a slower pace because of the Co-op program.

Fuck. THe delete key is broken. Oh well. I'm in a creative mood so I'm just going to type anyway - just really really slowly.

  
This is the full transcript from the audio I took from the interview with my dear friend the rising star.

  
TI (the interviewer) : So tell me, where did you come with the name ""The Rising Star?""

RS (the rising star) : Well it was a nickname I'd acquired while touring up north. We were playing poker with tarot cards. One of my cards was ""the rising star"" paired with ""the new face"" card and it someone thought it was really funny. So I go to a party a few weeks later with my new band and it's being organised by the same guy who I had played tarot poker with that night. When it comes time to introduce us, he forgets what are actual band name is and says ""ladies and gentlemen, here is the singer you've wanted to listen so so badly, The Rising Star!"" because that's the only name he remembered me by.

TI : Wow! That's wild!

RS : Yeah, right? So our manager, who had never actually listened to our music, actually thought that was our band name and that's how we started getting billed that way.

TI : Yeah, I was actually at one of your early shows before you changed your name - you guys were just so cool during a time in my life where everybody else around me felt so uptight.

RS : Oh wow, thank you. It's so nice to hear that.

TI : What do you think got you such outstanding TikTok and Youtube appreciation?

RS : I wow, I don't know what you mean.

TI : Oh yes you do. Your guitar solo video - the one that got more than a million streams on Spotify.

RS : Oh, that one. Yeah, that was a hard one to do, to. I got really lucky though and got it on the second take. I played cribbage that night and won five bucks, too.

TI : Ok now this one, I have been dying to ask you: what about the death rumours?

RS : Totally true.

TI : Haha. No they aren't.

RS : Haha. Yes they are.

TI : Wow! For real? You aren't trying to trick me?

RS : It is for real.

TI : What happened?

RS : Hold on a second. Oh wow. I'm really thirsty. Is there a can of Canada Dry anywhere nearby?

TI : Have this one on the house, Rising Star.

RS : (opens the can of Canada Dry) Wow, delicious! Nice and cold, too. Thanks very much for this very flavourful and tasty Canada Dry. Anyway. So I'm on a transcontinental tour and we get abducted by a cult. They tie us to chairs and ask us questions about cars. It makes no sense to any of us and one of us is getting horribly electrocuted. Oh man, it's awful. Like - they look at me straight in the eye and say ""you're next,"" they push a button but it's the other guy that gets electrocuted. Following the electrocution, they concoct a mummification elixir from the electrocuted victim's hair and skin and they used it to make me dead for a while as punishment for some lyric I'd written that really really pissed them off.

TI : That's just so wild.

RS : So then I come back to life and they're looking right at me, all holding baseball bats, and one of them says to me, ""how did you like being dead?"" I couldn't really recall but like it's different from being alive and unconscious. I've woken up a couple of times from being unconscious for one reason or another. Let me tell you something : waking up from being dead is a million times different. I was definitely dead and then brought back to life.

TI : Do you mind my asking how they killed you?

RS : As a matter of fact, I do. That's too personal.

TI : Of course, of course. So you're back to life, what do you do next?

RS : Well as it happened, I hadn't been dead very long so I could get back to what I was doing. I've got the new song out soon and I think it sounds ok.

TI : But what about the people holding the baseball bats?

RS : Oh, that. Well, that one was a lucky break, let me tell you. Just before they could pulverise me, one of them had a heart attack and they kept me alive for at least as long as needed to avoid adding any further stress to the individual. The ambulance was called the heart attack sufferer is saved just in time, and they decide to let me live afterall.

TI : I've got a question from username Athenia1251: what other people's music have you ever been likened to?

RS : Hmm. When I was younger, I got likened to Jesse Cook a lot which made sense - I had seen him live a couple of times.

CP (camera person) : Just to remind you, you are live on the air.

TI : Yes, I know that.

CP : Very good. So you should know that anything you do or say can and might be used against you in a court of law. Do you understand me when I say that?

RS : I think I'm going to go now.

CP (to RS) : You will stay exactly where you are.

CP (to TI) : I am not fucking around. I have been patient with you and i have got easy on you. If you don't live up to your end of the bargain, we will stab you horribly and repeatedly. What's going to be?

TI : What you are asking for is actually an impossibility due to the way chemistry works. It was in a Professor Dave video. It was very very thorough.

CP : You do have a point. Let me think it over. (there is a long silence in the audio and visual). Well we may as well get you a snack. What would you like?

RS : What have you got?

CP : Not much. We've got some vegan Coffee Crisp and Skittles. Actually, you can have them both.

RS : Oh wow! Thanks! Those are delicious.

TI : Glad to hear it.

(more silence, then the camera person's phone rings. The camera person answers the phone.)

CP : Yes... well ok then. (phone call ends). Nobody is sure what to do. I guess you're free to live for now but you still owe fucking big time.

TI : Well that's wonderful news. Anyway, just one final question before we wrap this up, Where are you playing next?

RS : We've partied pretty nicely in Tokyo but pretty soon, we'll be headed to Vancouver.

TI : I hope it goes really well. Thank you so much for the interview.

My norm is to be a sullen homebody but as usual the warm weather and sunshine remind me that being sociable is a good thing. I’m hoping that this weekend someone might be willing to meet up for coffee, preferably in the Highland or Merriam Park area. 

About me: my favorite band is the Struts. My favorite author is Stephen King but I’m currently finishing audiobooks by Jasper Fforde and Ursula de Guin, next on my TBR list is one of the King Arthur classics. I’m going down a rabbit hole listening to old Coast to Coast episodes with Art Bell, among other similarly supernatural and creepy podcasts, but I also listen to a few comedians too. I’m working my way through Star Trek (I just finished TOS and started the animated series) and the original Twilight Zone. 

If you’re down to chat with an awkward middle aged woman, hit me up. I’m better at listening than talking so if you have a story to share, *hell yes*. If you’re also awkward and want to bring a puzzle or something for an activity to do in companionable quiet time, I’m down for that too, I just want to meet a potential friend or two.",2,1742013025.0,twincitiessocial,0,1.0,False

I’m so impatient for the day I move out, but honestly I think it won’t be for a very long time unfortunately. my mom and her bf treat this apartment like a pig’s den. Is that the phrase? idk. 
They chain smoke cigarettes inside, my mom doesn’t fold clothes and leaves them in piles in the living room, also it’s extremely outdated and nothing is clean. she leaves the TV and lamp on when she’s not home, and it’s hard to turn it off because the tv remote is broken + the tv button is sticky. The lamp is hard to access because her trash and clothes are in the way. 
She has cigarette ashes all over the carpet. There’s also burn mark holes in the couch as well as the floor, both in the living room and bedroom. 

her bf has over 100 boxes of colognes laying out on their dresser, along with atleast 30 pairs of shoes taking up space that he will never wear because he doesn’t go out anywhere except work. he has a fucking guitar and speakers that he will NEVER use again in his life. He also had a heart attack and still continues to eat only fried foods and only drink 2 lt sodas and coffee

The dog shits and pees on a pee pad inside (occasionally she takes him outside), and they close their bedroom door so my cat is stuck inside with the cigarette smoke and i feel annoyed to keep opening the door for her. 
I have to throw out pizza boxes every night because her bf only orders take out even tho he works at a restaurant!!!!! Why is it my responsibility? I have to unload the dishwasher even though I hand clean my dishes and put them back in the cabinet ? 
My mom puts all of her mail on top of the STOVE !!! she uses the oven as storage for pots, pans, containers, and occasionally FILES??? there is a corner on the kitchen counter where it’s simply piled with old items she needs to go through and still hasn’t - i’m thinking about slowly throwing everything away, the pile has been there for atleast 5 months. 
Her bf leaves his old to go cups in the bedroom. He doesn’t wash his hands after he uses the bathroom. He doesn’t replace the toilet paper when he uses the last piece. He doesn’t clean the toilet after he shits on the seat (how is that possible?) 


My mom will also drink the last cup of some drink in the fridge- milk, orange juice, etc, and leave maybe 1/4 cup left, wtf? I will buy icecream and they will leave me maybe 1/2 cup left within one night. 
They have 3 cars- 2 new mercedes, 1 lexus. I’m driving a 2008 honda … 
 
im busy doing college, working, and trying to become an adult. I have to come home to a disgusting environment where i WANT to clean and do chores happily- but the surrounding environment is disgusting.

+

I’m very anxious I won’t find a stable job after I graduate. Im anxious I won’t even pass my classes- my current classes are so difficult and extremely boring, it’s so difficult to focus and stay motivated. I’m only in my 2nd year of college and I am only working part time; I don’t have much money saved. I’m also trying to save to either fix my car (axel, ball point issues, brakes, rotors) or just get a different one. My bf and I planned last year to move out but it ended up being bad timing and he was left with more of the financial responsibility so we chose not to until it is more fair for both of us. It’s also difficult to eat clean and stay healthy because it’s so expensive/time consuming to cook every night. also my mom and her bf will eat my food if i food prep🥲eventually I’ll get it all organized but for now it’s extremely difficult.

I finally listened to the doctor and decided to get an endoscopy where they found that I have a 2MM hiatal hernia and mild Gerd. I realized I might have it because I would burp all day so often and my chest would be hurting, but I also had a lot of sensitivity in my stomach as well and I thought it was because of my Gerd, but my doctor told me it is not something that is associated with Gerd and that’s why I should do a colonoscopy. I have a colonoscopy scheduled in a few days, but I wanted to share some of my symptoms And see if anyone can relate other than having a lot of gas and bloating depending on what I eat sometimes I immediately have to go to the bathroom and most of the days my stomach hurts rather than it feeling fine. For the past few days I’ve been having diarrhea, even if I eat something completely normal like watermelon and eggs. I also don’t smoke or drink and I’m not overweight. In fact I am at a healthy weight the only thing that I do as a risk factor is I’m not very active so I’m not really sure if it’s IBS or something worse like colon cancer. There was a time when I thought I saw a blood in my stool, but that was also when my mom was making me beetroot juices and after I stopped drinking them, I didn’t see blood in my stool, but I don’t know if the bleeding just went away. so far I’ve gotten a rectal exam where my doctor only found very tiny external hemorrhoids. I’ve also done a stool sample where it came back completely normal so I’ve decided to go for a colonoscopy. I also was wondering if anyone can relate where they find it hard to eat out with everyone else because so much food makes either their Gerd bad or Causes them to have diarrhea and stomach pain. 

Aside from that I was prescribed pantoprazole which I took for four weeks and then I stopped because I saw the bad side effects but now my girl is back and I don’t know what to do because I don’t wanna continue to take medicine that’s just gonna cause more problems what do you guys do to help your Gerd because this sucks not being able to eat my favorite things like coffee, chocolate, and tomato based Foods.

“Also I do remember you mentioning you wanted to meet up w mentors or people in Seattle in general, I def want to take you down to see the cherry blossoms but in addition to me taking you I do want to reserve some time for me & my partner to see them, so whenever you’re coffee chatting we’ll do our own cherry blossom sighting”

She reacted with a thumbs up emoji, I thought nothing of it. 3-4 days later she tells me a friend of hers is also coming to Seattle during the same time. I send 2 texts upfront about how excited I am and the groups we can get together to go out. 

3rd text, I tell her this: “feel free to hang out w her by yourself too, especially while my partner& i go out for cherry blossom sightings”

She then asks if i prefer to just see the cherry blossoms with my partner, and I’m confused because I thought I already emphasized that I do want to take her, but I also want to reserve a small pocket of time to take my partner and not neglect them. I wanted to separate the times since I don’t want either person to feel like they don’t have enough time with just me to do something special as this .

I reassure her again that I want to take her, and also take my partner separately. I told her i will take them early in the morning so she can sleep in or use the opportunity to see her other friend. i then mention i will take her another day and also tell her lots of trees have been popping up so we’ll run into them either way. left on read. she has a job that gets busy sometimes so i’m assuming it’s that and also her saying she has ADHD.

yesterday i realize i was left on read for all of wednesday so i send her another text not related to that convo but to meeting up with her friend. she instantly read what i sent but has not replied since. it’s friday evening now. 

I still have no idea if she’s just very busy with work and is finding the right time to talk about this? she has confronted me about her honest feelings in the past (felt disappointed that we couldn’t call one day, etc) so i think she would’ve told me if she was upset, but also i feel like she is actually upset and not telling me.

I think she doesn’t have the right to be upset… I don’t think what I suggested is unreasonable? I don’t know what she could be mad at me for?

Further context: 

•I live in Seattle and she’s coming during peak cherry blossom season (2 weeks). Trees have been popping up throughout the city so there’s a good chance we’ll just run into them wherever we walk

•I had a friend over in February who neglected me for a fling, so I hated being the one waiting around for a friend. I don’t want to wait around and be lonely while she hangs out with other friends, doesn’t seem fair to me. Seems more efficient that we both do our own thing and reconvene? This also affected my relationship with my partner since the stress from her visiting made me unknowingly neglect my partner and they got upset. 

•My friend knows about the situation above and we talked about our expectations; how often do we want to hang out when she’s visiting and is she okay with exploring on her own, who she plans to visit out there, etc. and we were on the same page during that convo. She is fine with doing some things alone and she mentioned wanting to meet mentors and old friends in Seattle 

•My friend does not have the money upfront but contacts me often and we are close, she mentioned wanting to visit me a lot so I agreed to buying the ticket for her and finding a time that works. She gave me 35% upfront and I told her she can pay it back slowly.

He recently moved to a different state a few hours away for something temporary work related, but it’s in an area we both were open to living in, so we talked about me moving there with him if he likes the area after a few months. Or he would just come back home after the few months of long distance. But that’s not going to happen because now the man I saw myself having a future with is cutting me out of HIS future.

It started with his work making him too busy to call me as often, but he’d still be posting on social media and his location would be at the gym or coffee shops or whatever. He’s allowed to have a life, but it hurt I was being prioritized less. 

Then he started following random women from that city on social media. At first it was few enough that I assumed they were genuine friends or connections but at some point there were so many random hot women, who didn’t even always follow him back, I realized he must be on a dating app or meeting them more than just randomly. 
Then he started answering my texts less and less, and turning his location off more and more often. 
Even when he does reply to me, our dynamic has changed. He just acts like a coworker that doesn’t want small talk and makes it uncomfortable and weird. 
As of today, I haven’t heard from him in over a day but he’s posted multiple times on his instagram. I’m assuming the relationship is beyond saving but it hurts me so much that this is how it’s going to end. We weren’t ever fighting, we got along so well and spent every second together just having amazing memories before he left. 

At least if there was disagreement or any kind of issue I would have closure but instead the man I thought I was going to marry is basically ghosting me like some meaningless talking stage.",2,1742012081.0,offmychest,5,1.0,False
