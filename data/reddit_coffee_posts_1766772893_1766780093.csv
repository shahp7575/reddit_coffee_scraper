Is it possible to create a Github/Pixel Habit Tracker using the iPhone Notes app with the input from “Ask for input/Choose Menu” action in the Apple shortcut?

The habit to track would be something like: “Have you had Coffee after 3pm” with a “Yes” = 🟩 and “No” = 🟥. 

In Notes, the first column should be the Days of the Month and the Column to be the first letter of the Months of the Year. 

The menu results in the Notes app should place the emoji result in the spot for today’s date.

We were accompanied by her clg bestie (idk she fears i will kidnap her or something).

I had a huge crush on this girl (SB) since feb 2025 and finally confessed my feelings on 7th july 2025 and she was fine with it.

We did some chatting and get to know each other more and more and more and also multiple deep talks about future too but due to some circumstances she says she cannot commit to me main reason being the future of workplace as i plan to move abroad and she decides to stay in India (we both are doctors) and caste (she is brahmin and im non brahmin general)

There were instances when i tried to push her away she stayed and also when she tried to push me away i stayed..... Major incident was on 4th dec when she said that she was not feeling a connection with me.... Now how can i give up on the only woman i desired for over a year.

Now i really like this girl..... sorry ""like"" is an understatement..... I really LOVE this girl because i dont find other girls worthy of my time as i think only about her 24/7 which i never did for anyone not also for my parents. 

Her fav flower is 🌻 
Her fav color is lavender 🪻 and shades of pink🩷 
My fav color is magenta and turquoise.

I hated mutton because of its smell but its her fav dish so it suddenly became my fav dish too.

I disliked tea as it ruined my mouth odour but i started liking it because she is a tea-holic 

I loved the fact that one time i told her that i like coffee more and now she remembers it and orders coffee for both of us

But she has huge mood swings which i like about her because whats a woman without a child-temper

One time she grabbed me by my arm and strolled down a crowded street and every one was looking at us.... I felt like i have to protect this lady at all cost because my inner husband material behaviour was kicking in which i never thought i had. 

Now things are not going well with her as she is trying to distance herself from me which i dont want to as i love her and don't want to lose her as she fits all my criteria and has a great personality which i adore

Even my mother likes her too as she took me to iskcon temple and my mother loved it as its religious and showcasing her home upbringing (i shared about her with my mother and this is the first time she is seeing her son in love)

She doesnt love me i know that but she will love me oneday as good things take time to achieve and she is worth all this trouble

1pwdi53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1pwdi53/secrets_akumal_review/,Secrets Akumal Review,"https://preview.redd.it/daelavdhtl9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bbdbb231828567d40ca351128a66ff79f83606f

Hello World!

I wanted to share an **honest take on Secrets Akumal**, because it’s one of those resorts that gets mentioned *constantly* and almost always in a very positive way. It’s an adults-only resort right on Akumal Beach and is known for its calm vibe, strong service, and genuinely great snorkeling — including swimming alongside sea turtles right off the beach.

It’s not a party place at all. Think spacious rooms, multiple pools, good food, and a relaxed, grown-up atmosphere. It’s especially popular with couples and people looking for something a bit more refined without being stuffy. That said, it’s not cheap, so the real question is whether it actually lives up to the hype and price tag. Here’s how our experience played out.

*This review is more of a snippet of our much more detailed review which you can find at* Travel Properly.

# Our Room at Secrets Akumal Riviera Maya

https://preview.redd.it/29m2ajojtl9g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=36da885104bb4e4db35cfaeb6e975a9a99cdb9f4

We stayed in a **Junior Suite**, and it ended up being a really solid choice. The room felt properly spacious rather than just somewhere to crash at night, which made a big difference on longer resort days. The balcony overlooked the resort’s greenery and was surprisingly peaceful — great for a morning coffee or winding down with a drink in the evening.

Inside, everything felt comfortable and well laid out: big bed, seating area, and a large bathroom with a soaking tub. Nothing over the top, but it definitely felt more like a luxury resort room than a standard hotel setup.

# Pools at Secrets Akumal

https://preview.redd.it/m033xx8ltl9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=679bf25370553d20e2b52068eae53e6e3617859b

The pool setup at Secrets Akumal was a pleasant surprise. For a fairly large resort, nothing ever felt overcrowded or stressful, and we never had to hunt for loungers. It was easy to just turn up, find a spot, and relax.

There are a few pools with different vibes. The main pool has a bit of energy with a swim-up bar and light music, but it never turns into a party. The quieter pools were our go-to when we wanted to properly switch off — calm, tucked away, and ideal for relaxing.

Poolside service was consistently good, with quick drink refills and staff checking in without being overbearing. Overall, the pools strike a great balance, though anyone who’s followed our content for a while will know we’re still very much **beach people**, and that’s where we spent most of our time.

# The Beach at Secrets Akumal

https://preview.redd.it/8s80qoqmtl9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0db23c5bb7622ea631afe9fb718b88d0c46554a6

Quick note on the photo above — it’s from the **left-hand side of the beach at Secrets Akumal**. It honestly doesn’t do the beach justice. We were having such a good time snorkeling and relaxing that we didn’t stop to take many proper photos.

The beach was easily one of the biggest highlights of our stay and a huge reason we’d go back. If you care at all about snorkeling, this place really stands out compared to most resorts in the Riviera Maya. The water is calm and clear, the sand is soft, and the bay-like layout creates ideal conditions for marine life.

We’re keen snorkellers and spent hours in the water, often barely swimming far from shore. We saw loads of tropical fish, rays, a sea turtle, and even an **endangered eagle ray**, which was honestly unforgettable. This wasn’t a lucky one-off either — marine life here feels normal, not rare.

On land, the beach itself is just as good. Plenty of loungers, shaded areas, and attentive service, but it never felt overcrowded or overdeveloped. The adults-only atmosphere really adds to the calm.

**Snorkeling tip:** swim along the **marked buoy line** and look for **sea grass** — that’s where turtles tend to feed. Take it slow and stay calm in the water. Also, bring your own snorkel gear if you can. It’s cheap to buy beforehand, saves renting, and having a properly fitting mask makes a huge difference.

For us, this beach wasn’t just somewhere to sunbathe — it was an experience in itself, and one of the best resort beaches we’ve snorkeled from.

# Restaurants & Dining at Secrets Akumal

https://preview.redd.it/wu4509aotl9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31a5d1d5e0412352568eda305612a799ef125ea

Dining is a major part of the overall experience at **Secrets Akumal Riviera Maya**, and it’s one area where the resort genuinely stands out. The sheer **choice of restaurants is impressive**, especially for an all-inclusive resort — with a strong selection of **à la carte dining options** that go far beyond the typical buffet-heavy setup. Having this many sit-down restaurants included in the price adds real value and means you can enjoy a different style of meal almost every night without feeling like you’re repeating the same experience.

https://preview.redd.it/tnlo4lmptl9g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8f005e8521026eea9dcaad71a0f00cecdc7092b

# Entertainment at Secrets Akumal

Entertainment at Secrets Akumal is pretty well balanced and never feels forced. During the day, most of the action happens around the bars and pool areas if you want something social, but it’s just as easy to keep things low-key.

In the evenings, the theatre hosts proper shows, and there are also live music options around the resort. On top of that, there are extra activities like pool games, beach activities, and organised jungle tours if you feel like doing more than just relaxing. Overall, it’s easy to be as active or as chilled as you want without the resort pushing entertainment on you.

# Final Verdict – Is Secrets Akumal Worth It?

When we started looking into Secrets Akumal, the main questions were pretty simple: *is it actually worth the price, is it genuinely luxury, and does it live up to all the hype?* After staying there, the answer for us was honestly **yes to all three**.

There’s a reason this resort keeps popping up at the top of Tripadvisor and gets so many strong reviews. It didn’t feel like overhyped marketing — it felt like a resort that consistently delivers what people expect when they book it.

This is easily **one of the best resorts we’ve ever stayed at**. The beach alone puts it in a different category, with snorkeling straight from shore, regular wildlife sightings, and calm water that never got old. Add in the tropical setting and the overall atmosphere just feels peaceful and well balanced.

Food was another big win. Having access to so many à la carte restaurants made a huge difference, and the quality — especially at dinner — felt well above average. It’s one of the few all-inclusive resorts we’ve stayed at where dining didn’t feel like a compromise.

That said, it’s definitely **not a party resort**. This place is clearly aimed at couples, honeymooners, and anyone looking for a quieter, more relaxed trip. There’s entertainment and live music, but it’s all polished and controlled, not loud or chaotic.

For us, the luxury here isn’t about flashy extras — it’s about consistency, atmosphere, and experience. If you care about a great beach, snorkeling, good food, and a calm adults-only vibe, Secrets Akumal really does live up to its reputation.

If anyone wants a deeper dive, we’ve written a **much more detailed review** on our blog that goes into way more depth on rooms, food, snorkeling, entertainment, and activities. Happy to answer questions here too if you’re considering it.

I really did put my best self out there. Joked around. Mentioned her name with a smile when asked. Pretended that everything's ok. 

Midnight. Magsisearch lang sana ako ng dota 2 posts when I noticed na nasa search history ko pa pala sya. Same name. New profile pic. 

Decided to check her profile. *(Alam kong bad idea)*. Wala naman ako masyado makita since naka lock profile sya. Di naman na din kami friends sa fb. 

She already removed our pic as a cover photo and replaced it with random color. Same with mine. Mas nauna lang ako. Removed all of our photo. Sinama ko na lahat maski solo pics ko just to disguise it as fb cleansing. Ayaw kong mahalata ng family and friends ko ang nangyayari.

I decided to check her profile using my CP just to make sure na talagang nagpalit nga sya ng profile pic. *(Since I remember di naman nagbago yung image nya sa fb app ko)*

Confirmed that she updated her profile pic. Need lang iclick sa mismong profile nya para makita ung changes since sa chat head di pa sya naguupdate. 

Sa CP, I could see her photo clearly. She looked beautiful and really happy. I'm really happy for her. Mukhang na enjoy nya ang December. Especially it's her birth month and of course Christmas. 

That's when I noticed that. That cover photo na akala ko eh random gradient color lang. Meron palang text sa gitna. Di ko maview fully since napuputol yung upper half but I could still read it clearly:

***""Let go""***

Everything went back. That Tuesday morning. The day I knew everything. Our conversations after. *Their* conversations.

The moment that I realized we won't be the same. 

Alam kong inamin mo na lahat sa chat natin. Sinabi mo din na sana mabuo ulit tayo. Honestly... Magsisinungaling ako kung sasabihin kong ayaw ko din. (Takte, walang araw na diko pinipigilan sarili ko na ichat ka) 

But I really believed na ito ang right decision. Para sating dalawa. 

Ang hinihingi ko lang naman sana ay closure. Gusto ko sana magkausap tayo ng personal. 

You said you needed space. Di mo kamu ako kayang harapin dahil sa ginawa mo sakin.

Gets ko naman. I really do. It just... sucks. 7 years natin natapos lang ng ganito. 

Thru chat. Ni hindi ko man lang nakita ano reactions mo. Explanation. Answers. Iiyak ka din ba? Maski ung sinabi mong walang wala ako kumpara sa kanya. Kahit yun gusto ko mismo marinig galing sayo. 

Siguro nga mas ok din na ang last na pagsasama natin eh day before ko malaman ang lahat.  Yung pagyaya mo sakin ng coffee date, yung kwentuhan natin, tawanan, plans ko sana para ngayong Christmas at New Year para makabawi sayo sa mga time na wala ako . Yung last effort sayo ng parents ko na ihatid ka kahit nasira pala ung tricycle namin nung bumaba na ako. Kinumusta ka pa nila sakin pagkauwi ko. Kasi nag alala sila baka nalate ka. Monday pa naman daw.

Naalala ko ung first letter ko sa'yo nung Valentine's Day, kada palit ko ng CP pati un nililipat ko din eh.

There's a line there that is always in my mind and made me cherish those years:

An interesting experience with [Breville Bambino Plus and Breville Smart Pro Grinder],"Dialing In Help. Anyone have this combination? The result was too sour even though it was too slow. Roast date of beans was December 9th. Coffee roaster was Pilot Coffee. I am putting 18grams (medium dark roast) into a 54mm portafilter, using a blind shaker, a WDT tool, a weighted spring loaded tamper. I run the bambino holding the double shot button down for 8 seconds before releasing it then stopping at 36 grams. And the timer is somewhere around 45 seconds or higher to get that 36 grams So you can see I am at least 15 to 20 seconds to slow. Puck ended up perfect in the sense i cracked it open and it had gone all the way through ( wasn't soggy when i took it out or dry).

Many go with higher end grinders as they say it can handle finer grinding and less static. I figured I would stick with my smart pro grinder as it got good reviews on youtube. I figure it would turn out too fast but it was the complete opposite. It went far too slow. Meaning its too fine. So what was my settings? I changed the internal on the smart grinder pro to 5 from (6 the default) and ran it at 11 on the outside but it was too slow. I changed it to 13 on the outside, but again too slow but faster than before.

Tomorrow I may put the internal grind from 5 back to 6 and then pull 3 more shots through it. Trying around 13 to 16 in grind settings and see if it speeds up.",1,1766779141.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Hello World!

  
I wanted to share an **honest take on Secrets Akumal**, because it’s one of those resorts that gets mentioned *constantly* and almost always in a very positive way. It’s an adults-only resort right on Akumal Beach and is known for its calm vibe, strong service, and genuinely great snorkeling — including swimming alongside sea turtles right off the beach.

It’s not a party place at all. Think spacious rooms, multiple pools, good food, and a relaxed, grown-up atmosphere. It’s especially popular with couples and people looking for something a bit more refined without being stuffy. That said, it’s not cheap, so the real question is whether it actually lives up to the hype and price tag. Here’s how our experience played out.

*This review is more of a snippet of our much more detailed review which you can find at* [Travel Properly.](https://travel-properly.com/2025/12/26/secrets-akumal-review/)

# Our Room at Secrets Akumal Riviera Maya

https://preview.redd.it/23wy7wm5rl9g1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=68553da1448ea1f79f79fef921f046ddfe01551e

We stayed in a **Junior Suite**, and it ended up being a really solid choice. The room felt properly spacious rather than just somewhere to crash at night, which made a big difference on longer resort days. The balcony overlooked the resort’s greenery and was surprisingly peaceful — great for a morning coffee or winding down with a drink in the evening.

Inside, everything felt comfortable and well laid out: big bed, seating area, and a large bathroom with a soaking tub. Nothing over the top, but it definitely felt more like a luxury resort room than a standard hotel setup.

# Pools at Secrets Akumal 

https://preview.redd.it/gzi1uvgerl9g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c7a5ab062fe4387edf88a207aa12ff1886ac65

The pool setup at Secrets Akumal was a pleasant surprise. For a fairly large resort, nothing ever felt overcrowded or stressful, and we never had to hunt for loungers. It was easy to just turn up, find a spot, and relax.

There are a few pools with different vibes. The main pool has a bit of energy with a swim-up bar and light music, but it never turns into a party. The quieter pools were our go-to when we wanted to properly switch off — calm, tucked away, and ideal for relaxing.

Poolside service was consistently good, with quick drink refills and staff checking in without being overbearing. Overall, the pools strike a great balance, though anyone who’s followed our content for a while will know we’re still very much **beach people**, and that’s where we spent most of our time.

# The Beach at Secrets Akumal 

https://preview.redd.it/7y8o743prl9g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b20c94c74fc306643b5a883b32b4082ef1c4af8

Quick note on the photo above — it’s from the **left-hand side of the beach at Secrets Akumal**. It honestly doesn’t do the beach justice. We were having such a good time snorkeling and relaxing that we didn’t stop to take many proper photos.

The beach was easily one of the biggest highlights of our stay and a huge reason we’d go back. If you care at all about snorkeling, this place really stands out compared to most resorts in the Riviera Maya. The water is calm and clear, the sand is soft, and the bay-like layout creates ideal conditions for marine life.

We’re keen snorkellers and spent hours in the water, often barely swimming far from shore. We saw loads of tropical fish, rays, a sea turtle, and even an **endangered eagle ray**, which was honestly unforgettable. This wasn’t a lucky one-off either — marine life here feels normal, not rare.

On land, the beach itself is just as good. Plenty of loungers, shaded areas, and attentive service, but it never felt overcrowded or overdeveloped. The adults-only atmosphere really adds to the calm.

**Snorkeling tip:** swim along the **marked buoy line** and look for **sea grass** — that’s where turtles tend to feed. Take it slow and stay calm in the water. Also, bring your own snorkel gear if you can. It’s cheap to buy beforehand, saves renting, and having a properly fitting mask makes a huge difference.

For us, this beach wasn’t just somewhere to sunbathe — it was an experience in itself, and one of the best resort beaches we’ve snorkeled from.

# Restaurants & Dining at Secrets Akumal 

https://preview.redd.it/0nvn76sxrl9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c947baa83d275fd5fcbc75cd8922f1de1dd2d8

Dining is a major part of the overall experience at **Secrets Akumal Riviera Maya**, and it’s one area where the resort genuinely stands out. The sheer **choice of restaurants is impressive**, especially for an all-inclusive resort — with a strong selection of **à la carte dining options** that go far beyond the typical buffet-heavy setup. Having this many sit-down restaurants included in the price adds real value and means you can enjoy a different style of meal almost every night without feeling like you’re repeating the same experience.

# Entertainment at Secrets Akumal

Entertainment at Secrets Akumal is pretty well balanced and never feels forced. During the day, most of the action happens around the bars and pool areas if you want something social, but it’s just as easy to keep things low-key.

In the evenings, the theatre hosts proper shows, and there are also live music options around the resort. On top of that, there are extra activities like pool games, beach activities, and organised jungle tours if you feel like doing more than just relaxing. Overall, it’s easy to be as active or as chilled as you want without the resort pushing entertainment on you.

# Final Verdict – Is Secrets Akumal Worth It?

When we started looking into Secrets Akumal, the main questions were pretty simple: *is it actually worth the price, is it genuinely luxury, and does it live up to all the hype?* After staying there, the answer for us was honestly **yes to all three**.

There’s a reason this resort keeps popping up at the top of Tripadvisor and gets so many strong reviews. It didn’t feel like overhyped marketing — it felt like a resort that consistently delivers what people expect when they book it.

This is easily **one of the best resorts we’ve ever stayed at**. The beach alone puts it in a different category, with snorkeling straight from shore, regular wildlife sightings, and calm water that never got old. Add in the tropical setting and the overall atmosphere just feels peaceful and well balanced.

Food was another big win. Having access to so many à la carte restaurants made a huge difference, and the quality — especially at dinner — felt well above average. It’s one of the few all-inclusive resorts we’ve stayed at where dining didn’t feel like a compromise.

That said, it’s definitely **not a party resort**. This place is clearly aimed at couples, honeymooners, and anyone looking for a quieter, more relaxed trip. There’s entertainment and live music, but it’s all polished and controlled, not loud or chaotic.

For us, the luxury here isn’t about flashy extras — it’s about consistency, atmosphere, and experience. If you care about a great beach, snorkeling, good food, and a calm adults-only vibe, Secrets Akumal really does live up to its reputation.

If anyone wants a deeper dive, we’ve written a [**much more detailed review**](https://travel-properly.com/2025/12/26/secrets-akumal-review/) on our blog that goes into way more depth on rooms, food, snorkeling, entertainment, and activities.

I awoke in a house I didnt know. The people that I could recognize. I couldntt put names to each one since this dream is a blurr. I was trapped in this house. They lock it at night to keep 'bad men' out. A crazy guy lived next door that hated women. As I was laying in a bed next to the girl that was close to my age. We both wanted to kiss eachother. So we did, it escalated to us grinding on eachother but than I heard someone at the door. So I pulled the covers over us and pretended I was asleep. The mom came in drug her daughter, said shes locking the door so that guy doesnt come back in and cause havoc. I got an immediate uneasy feeling and snuck my way to the front door. I realized I've escaped this house before in a different dream wtf. So I put on random shoes as fast as I could and just started running. One of the bigger ladies decided she was gunna chase after me. But I'm really fast and catch on so I figured after running straight I'd turn left than left again. I was on a completely different street. I traveled downtown trying to escape and than I saw a child almost dropping a little black cat. So I took it from her and continued on my way finding home. Well long story short I found my way home. Which I never go to in my dreamworld because bad things always happen when I'm there. So I toughened up and went inside. I immediately up in my bed but I felt weird. I couldnt cry even though I was upset, my body felt numb and distant. I walked to the bathroom and turned on the light. Everything was normal. I was awake or so I thought. I looked in the mirror and my eyes looked really tired. Like I smoked a big joint. When i didnt. My moms coffee mug was in the bathroom like she was sup for work getting ready. So I assumed I woke up really early. I told her I had a bad dream and my body now feels weird. I said the same thing to my stepdad as I gave each my parents a hug. As I hugged my stepdad than stood there after I realized my body doesnt feel real. I than woke up for real in my bed.

1pwd9jm,https://i.redd.it/nm8tq6oasl9g1.jpeg,The importance of agenda piece (useless rambling),"Idfk what i was thinking making this post but i just wanted an excuse to use this pic ig

A majority of people have heard pf the dead internet theory, its basically the assumption that either now or in the near future, the amount of bots online will vastly outweigh the number of human users online, i'd like to propose a different branch or idea of that theory, something like ""limbo internet theory"" or ""limbo fandom theory"" (holy pretentious)

Instead of a fandom or internet being filled with mostly bots, its full of people who just karma-farm / like-farm with absolute minimal effort, and even if the joke isnt funny at all, or outdated, or if they're just singing empty praises, they somehow receive attention parroting the same things. 

The initial joke of ussop not being sogeking was probably funny back in 2005, or those ""u mad bro"" style memes (idk how to describe them), but in the beautiful gracious year of 2019-2021, why were they *still* making those jokes? 

I have the answer, its because all the jokes are built off of *praise*, a majority of the older one piece jokes have the same foundation, and that is swallowing whatever joke oda put on the plate, no matter how many times he kicked the horses corpse.

Ussop is a pussy, Nami is a high-tempered gold digger and hits luffys head a lot, luffy is an airhead that likes food, zoro is lost, sanji is a simp, brook likes panties, wheres zoro? Franky is 100% SUPERRRRR, *where the hell is zoro?*

It even extends outside the strawhats, with characters like señor pink, who made the joke that he was sooo manly and hard boiled? Oda. 

An example similar to this phenomenon is the jjba fandom, i LOVE jjba, but outside of agendapiece-style humor i see on insta or X, jjba has the most unfunny and parroting fandom ever, because the jokes lingered for WAY TOO LONG.

Now, how did the one piece fandom become so goated? How did we achieve peak humor? peak handsomeness? How are we so *goated*?

We made jokes built off odas shortcomings. Mihawk is a fraud because despite being the best swordsman, he has no on screen feats. Shanks is a fraud for using haki knots instead of his own haki, Shanks is a golden boy for always being there to save the day, wether it be coby or the scabbards, hes always *there* for some reason, and dont even get me started on dogshitman, or fraudger, or runbeard

All of these jokes are build off poor writing decisions, bad choices done with beloved characters, all odas fault

Agendapiece helped balance the completely unnecessary over-glazing, its like adding sugar to a bitter cup of coffee, makes every fumble in odas writing something to be a little excited for, since many minds are on standby ready to make peak slander the moment the spoilers drop, like toadgashi 

Ever since the birth of agendapiece a tone shift has occurred in the one piece fandom, theres still good moments to praise, wonderful backstories and characters, but theres a lot of fuck ups to capitalize on, writing mistakes to point out and criticize using slander ",3,1766778745.0,Piratefolk,1,1.0,False

bom, primeiramente, não gostei desse excelente iem, o que tornou essa tarefa de extrair seu potencial torturante, sei que repetirei essa tarefa outras vezes, é bom para descobrir o meu fit de áudio. 
concordo que esse fone compete com fones mais caros, mas nem tanto, no máximo com fones até R$150, paguei R$68.

pontos positivos:
esse fone é extremamente técnico detalhoso, analítico, guitarristicamente falando é ótimo para tirar músicas tanto as notas quanto o timbre. os baixos são incríveis, só poderiam ser mais aparentes, (deve dar pra corrigir com eq), na verdade tudo é bem definido, o nível de detalhe chega perto do kz decet.

Ponto forte/característico:
os médios são bem aparentes e de qualidade ok. aguenta qualquer tipo de mix, desde as menos até a as mais densas, com maestria, nada embola.

Pontos negativos:
o principal é que ele soa seco, 'sem molho', sem reverb, sem ressonância ou algo assim, sabe aquela cama de teclado que algumas músicas tem?, aqui fica em terceiro plano. os agudos são tratados da mesma forma, as percussões ficam um pouco escondidas.

pontos ok:
os vocais soam bem, em algumas musicas muito bem. separação de instrumentos são ok.

como é ouvir o kunten com a zisin:
mantem todos os apectos já falados, mas soando mais natural e mais detalhado, parece que vc está assistindo a um ensaio de uma banda, no meio da banda, ouvindo as vozes como se fossem a capela, as percursões e as camas de teclado continuam numa sala ao lado. eu gostei bastante do resultado, me faz ter vontade de ouvi-lo, menos os flashback, que ficam broxante.

1pwd4ub,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pwd4ub,My findings: Nervous System and Tinnitus,"Quick recap: my tinnitus started in Oct 2022, it's in both ears and sometimes in my head. No hearing damage or loss. Every doc I've seen (internist, neurologist, dentist, maxillofacial, ENT...) says it's stress-related. In 2022 I was going through a tough emotional time, but by 2023 I was doing great and couldn't figure out where the stress was coming from. I'd ask myself, stress about what? I don't feel stressed mentally or emotionally in my day-to-day.

Turns out it's my body that's stressed... 

It's physiological stress. 

Sleepless nights, demanding work, not leaving the house, no hobbies outside work, too many stimulants (coffee, soda, blue light...), irregular meals, eating on the go... it all started messing with my central nervous system. Not to mention the super annoying tinnitus in both ears 24/7 that disrupts rest, sleep, etc.

I realized I grind my teeth at night, my posture's always stiff, shoulders and neck always tense, headaches, waking up a lot at night, major fatigue... My maxillofacial doc sent me to an osteopath and that's when things started improving. I've been going regularly since April 2025. I improve when I go, but symptoms come again if I stop.

2 months ago I got a smart ring that measures stress, sleep, heart rate, etc. Turns out my physiological stress is through the roof! My heart rate's elevated at night, not getting restorative sleep… like I'm not sleeping at all. The ring's data's been crazy.

I saw a cardiologist, got a holter monitor (24hr heart rate tracker), results in Jan (doc's on holiday). Everyone (docs, AI tracking my symptoms, smart ring, me) thinks it's sustained physiological stress causing central nervous system hypersensitivity. 

Maybe that's the tinnitus cause: a dysregulated CNS.

I've been on work vacation for days. Sleeping loads, resting at home... and the ring's still showing crazy stress levels. My mind and emotions are fine, but my body's stuck in alert mode. The cardiologist mentioned maybe a year-long med treatment to calm the nervous system + osteopathy + lifestyle changes.

No treatment plan yet, but wanted to share. Maybe some of us are like this: sustained physiological stress, body's super sensitive and we didn't notice. Symptoms show up when stress is huge. Hopefully my story helps. Let's keep fighting this annoying symptom and getting our CNS back.

I'll post my smart ring graphs from vacation days where I rested a lot. Imagine a demanding 8-10hr workday. That is what's causing/maintaining my tt, I think. When it gets this extreme, you need comprehensive treatment and lifestyle changes for sustainable improvement. I'd recommend a smart ring/watch that tracks heart rate, stress, sleep… might discover something interesting. I use Oura Ring, lots of options out there. 

Will update more later.

PS: 

I've also noticed, from the graphs, that consuming short video social media (TikTok, Instagram...) spikes my stress. And that response seems obvious if we look at the science. Short videos, info overload in 1 minute, one after another... they activate dopamine to crazy levels and then drop it. This causes induced attention deficit and hyperactivity. A hyperactive brain from overstimulation will also affect the central nervous system. When I stop consuming social media and do stuff like read a book, paint, write by hand... the Oura ring shows restorative time. Maybe that's part of the path.",5,1766778408.0,tinnitus,0,0.86,False
1pwd4hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1pwd4hz/newbie_questions/,Newbie questions,"Sorry in advance, I know there are lots of questions from newbies. I did a lot of research after I got my Moka pot and have followed the advice from so called “coffee experts” on YouTube, but my cup ended up super bitter. Here’s what I did:

-Used hot distilled water from a kettle 
-Used a medium roast coffee ground slightly finer than brew coffee but not as course as espresso. It was bought during a trip in the Dominican Republic so it’s not a name brand but has a nice flavor typically 
- used an aeropress filter
- preheated electric stove to medium heat, dropped to medium-low once the brew started
- as soon as I heard/saw sputtering I took it off the heat and ran the bottom under cold water to stop the brew 

I tried this twice and got a very bitter extraction both times. I’m going to go to a coffee shop and buy another coffee to try and ask them to grind it for me. Outside of that, I’m not sure what else I did wrong! If anything, my coffee was too course,
but I’ve read that wouldn’t contribute to bitterness. ",2,1766778384.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

Especially, the fingers. Mine has gotten so much worse in the last year. Doctors/Specialists I have seen are out of ideas with the exception of surgery. But, I do not want surgery as it doesnt always help in all cases.

I have a hard time opening any jars, bottles, just generally doing anything which involves fingers. The knots on finger joints are painful but I have accepted that its just going to be that way except for that small amount of time after lidocaine cream, etc.

I have accepted that my two favorite hobbies are gone. Both required a lot of hand and finger work. 

So, how do I manage unavoidable things like:

Holding onto coffee cup, cellphone  screen stylus, pens, markers, even pulling pants on and tying shoes.

Oh, I can eventually tie shoelace or pull velcro straps off but its a struggle. Looking for everyday small tips that worked for you. I'm really tired of dropping things from lack of grasp.

Three weeks into ADF, and it’s going better than I expected, even through the holidays. I would like to hear from anyone combining GLP-1 medications while doing ADF? I’m curious how others are using ADF with the jabs, are you doing ADF continuously, in cycles, or just occasionally? Has anyone come off the meds and continued with ADF, and the outcome?

I’m 61 and was diagnosed with Type II diabetes a few months ago. It hit hard. One morning I thought I was having a stroke. I couldn’t get out of bed, my hands and feet were numb, and my glucose was over 400. Cholesterol was over 300. Doctors wanted me on insulin immediately, which I really wanted to avoid.

What’s interesting is this all happened *after* I’d already lost 78 pounds. Looking back, it was years of insulin resistance catching up with me. Instead of insulin, my doctor and I decided to try Mounjaro. I weighed 218 at the time.

I live in Mexico half the year, close to a large fresh market, and knew I could clean things up. Within two days on the medication, my glucose dropped to around 140. Appetite dropped quickly, digestion slowed, and overeating became uncomfortable. The only real side effect I experienced was my intestines readjusting to the shot, some days diarrhea, then a week without pooping, which freaked me out. It all worked out in the end, pun intended, and things are back to normal now.

Three months in on the jabs, I was down to 188 and hit a plateau. The issue with these meds is the push to keep increasing dosage and stay on them long term. That’s not my plan. I plan to taper off when I hit my goal. I take a low weekly dose, aim for a goal weight of 150, and focus on fixing years of bad habits. I don’t want this shot to be forever. Today, I’m down to 183, which feels great and shows the progress is still happening. I am now able to listening more to my body instead of being hyperglycemic and numb.

A supportive partner matters. Mine wasn’t at first, then she was diagnosed with diabetes too. Misery apparently loves company. Now we’re aligned. Funny how that works.

We eat mostly whole foods now: no sugar, no sugary drinks, no beer, no processed junk. Eating this way is far easier outside the U.S., where eating healthy has become absurdly expensive. What I used to spend on groceries, in the US, now covers rent and food in Mexico.

When the plateau hit, I added alternate day fasting (36-hour fasts). Thanks to the medication, it was surprisingly easy, even a Christmas family meal wasn’t an issue; I enjoyed it and went right back to routine.

ADF restarted weight loss right away without increasing meds. I walk 30 minutes daily, even on fast days. My glucose stays around 85-100 (which has always been my norm), hunger is minimal, and on eating days I sometimes have to remind myself to eat.

Muscle loss is the downside at my age. Walking alone isn’t enough, so I target 100g+ of protein on eating days and plan to restart resistance training soon after a five month break.

I find that electrolytes matter when fasting. It took away the headaches and dizziness that came with fasting. I make my own mix. On fast days it’s water, electrolytes, and coffee with cream. Old habits are hard to break. Purists won’t love it, but It works for me.

Once hunger is controlled, everything changes. Weight loss is steady at about two pounds a week, and for the first time this feels sustainable. We will see when I eventually taper off the jabs.

This was never about aesthetics as commercials now pump regarding the jabs. The jabs were literally a life saver to get me stabilized. It’s now all about health, longevity, and avoiding my feet getting chopped off.",2,1766778283.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False

I am a thorough person so this is the post-op report I would have liked to read before deciding on a surgeon and hope it helps someone in the future. Shoutout to the other few guys who posted their post-op pics from their surgeries with Dr. Nash on this sub. They were so helpful to me and I hope this is helpful to someone else too. 

**Pics at the bottom!**

**TL;DR:** DI with free nipple grafts, large chest. I am a bit of a bear of a guy and wasn't told I had to lose weight to qualify. Needed stable weight for 6 months, 1 WPATH letter from licensed mental health professional. Dr. Nash takes insurance. I waited about 1.5 years from initial referral to surgery date. I would highly recommend him to other bigger guys. 

I have had a good experience and am feeling great on minimal Tylenol a week after surgery, so I took some time to write this up from my house rest, post-holiday. :) 

**Procedure:** DI with free nipple grafts

  
**Relevant about me:** 

Coming up on about 2 years on T, lived socially as nonbinary for a long time before that. None gender with left beef (transmasc) but the government's got me as M on all the important papers for ease. 

I have a BMI that fluctuates between 36-38 depending on how many delicious treats are a part of the season. I do a LOT of walking/cycling and I typically do a fitness classes for fun about once a week, so I am proudly stocky. Last time I bought a bra I was a 36F/G cup. T made me broader and my outward chest projection larger than that for sure but I never exactly measured it. 

**Timeline to Surgery:** 

First Referral from GAC provider: April 2024

PA Appointment with OSU Plastic Surgery: July 2025

Consultation with Dr. Nash: October 2025

Insurance Approval: November 2025

Surgery: Originally scheduled for June 2026, but moved up to December 2025

**Insurance:** Yes, takes insurance. Was in-network with mine (which is not fantastic insurance either) and my out-of-pocket cost was under $1k including facilities fee, physician fee, surgery fees, anesthesia fees. OSU has financial assistance/payment programs available as well if you need to split up your out-of-pocket and the financial counseling team is reachable via your MyChart. 

**Surgeon and Surgeon's Requirements:** 

[My surgeon was Dr. David Nash at OSU. ](https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/david-w-nash)

His profile on OSU Wexner's website use to list GAC as a specialty and other guys have posted their great results from him. Unfortunately, as you know, \[insert national and state-specific idiocy here\] so it's no longer listed, but he specializes in reconstructive procedures and is VERY skilled at them. I was originally scheduled for surgery over the summer but due to \[insert national and state-specific idiocy here\] I had to move it last-minute to the holidays and got very, very lucky that a date opened up. 

I was given no BMI requirement. I was just asked that my weight remain stable for 6 months before surgery, as the procedure would be tailored to fit my body-as is. I really liked this approach, as I also have no desire to lose weight and have greatly enjoyed my personal bearification process on T. 

I needed 1 WPATH letter from a licensed mental health professional. I don't recall ever discussing a requirement to be on T or live socially as a certain gender for a period of time as a surgery requirement either. I was not required to stop T before surgery, just not apply it the day-of because I use gel. 

  
**Thoughts on the process:** 

I was not looking forward to big hospital bureaucracy but it was better than expected. A lot of the plastic surgery department at OSU is medspa advertising and there's a lot of subtly gendered stuff that comes with plastic surgery you have to tune out, but I never had an issue with anyone working at OSU. Reception, nurses, MAs, PAs, all lovely. 

Dr. Nash is great. He is subtly funny and has a calm demeanor that puts you at ease. Just a chill guy. 

His PA is very straightforward and easy to work with. You'll meet with her for your final pre-op appointment a week before and get your instructions on what meds to take/not-take, how to use surgical drains, your antiseptic wash for the night before, etc. 

His office staff communicates well. He has a separate scheduler from the rest of the OSU plastic department, who you will talk to via MyChart. You will get a nicely formatted message from her with all your pre-op appointments after you pass the PA gauntlet and are deemed a good candidate for surgery. 

The month before your surgery, you'll do a virtual anesthesia consult with a nurse, then you'll have a final pre-op appointment a week before surgery. I did not get charged for either, but you may have different insurance and YMMV. 

**Surgery Experience:** 

My surgery was at the Eye & Ear Institute Building in Columbus but sometimes Dr. Nash will also do surgery at the Dublin, OH Outpatient Surgical Center. 

I got a MyChart message from Dr. Nash's scheduler as well as a call from OSU central two days before to confirm the time to arrive at the outpatient surgery and my estimated out-of-pocket cost. 

I was told to go NPO at 11 PM the night before surgery. Day-of, I arrived at 9 am. Typically they'll have you there 2 hours before you're scheduled to go into the OR. 

The check-in process was nice and the obligatory scarlet and grey branded OSU folder they give you of your post-surgery instructions includes a little card your friend/family member/chaperone can take to the first-floor cafe for a free coffee or tea while they wait for you. 

OSU also has a text alert system they will sign your chaperone up for that will give them updates on your progress through the day (pre-op, in surgery, out of surgery, ready for pickup) like that one Tumblr post about getting updates on their roommate like a pizza on the Domino's delivery tracker. 

  
My actual surgical experience was great. I have been fortunate enough to not ever require surgery so this was my first one. They preloaded me with some anti-anxiety meds before they started pumping the big stuff into me via IV. I was able to ask for the IV to be placed via ultrasound before anyone spent time poking me and failing and nobody seemed annoyed that I asked preemptively. The nurses kept bringing me warm blankets and updated me on progress because the day of my surgeon was running a little late on a surgery before mine. 

You'll also meet the anesthesiologist the day of as well who will go over the plan with you and run through a final medical history and day-of checklist.

Once they're ready, it's very quick. I remember absolutely nothing after they wheeled me down the hall and woke up comfortable in warm blankets and presented with a chocolate chip cookie by a kind nurse who helped me get dressed and put chapstick on my cracked-ass lips from no water and intubation. 14/10 experience.

  
I was sent home with 3 days of Roxicodone but didn't need to use it after the first two days. I also had scripts for ibuprofen 800, docusate (for opioid/post-anesthesia constipation, it's very real, do not skip docusate even if you don't use the stronger pain meds), and 7 days of twice-a-day antibiotics. 

**Post-Op:**

I mainly slept on my couch for the first week because with the drains I wanted to make sure I wasn't rolling around in my sleep and could not really be assed to climb into bed. It was hard enough to get around. The drains are deeply annoying and the worst part about DI, I won't lie, but once they're out you feel 10000x better. I asked to have mine placed a little lower so I could strip/empty them myself because my friend who was coming over to help me after surgery is squeamish. It was very doable myself, even groggy and in pain. 

Around day 6-7 post-op you have a follow-up appointment at the clinic where they remove your drains if the output is less than 30ml for the last 3 days. Dr. Nash also does not bolt down his nipple graft dressings with stitches the traditional way, so the nipple dressing removal was very straightforward and painless. Mine adhered perfectly to the skin below. They look very scary when the dressing comes off but that's normal. The drain removal was worse than the nips: not painful exactly, but a weird feeling. Just... prepare yourself. 

Dr. Nash's restriction and 24/7 post-op binder period are a bit longer at six weeks each. I was told not to lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (5 lbs) for that time and am operating with t-rex arms around the house. I was sent home with extra gauze and xeroform for the nipples. After a week of xeroform dressing, you can switch to Aquaphor and regular cotton gauze pads under the binder. 

**Overall:**

I would highly recommend Dr. Nash for larger guys. My incisions are great and look so natural on my body. I have very minimal swelling and bruising just a week after. I am very excited to see how I heal up over the next year and will try to remember to post healed progress and link here for everyone's collective knowledge.  Happy new year!

  
**Pics:** 



[Dr. Nash will leave the tape on the incisions until it falls off in about two weeks from showering. I had some oozing through the tape when I went to my first post-op appointment that the PA was not worried about at all and a bit more post drain-removal.

I will explain, but just know that I honor I ruined my life and am responsible for my own decisions/oversight.

**TL;DR: Took CBD daily for past few years through debilitating insomnia; eliminated CBD, sleep improved dramatically. Found real, sound empirical research demonstrating that CBD can hurt sleep in some individuals.**

*(Please be kind. This is my honest, lived experience. I know I am a bit of an idiot. I also know this isn't going to be the ""cure"" for many of you, but it seems to be mine.)*

Let me start by saying that I am 24 and have struggled with extreme insomnia for the past four years. I specifically remember the day it started: Cinco de Mayo of 2021. After a lifetime of sleeping perfectly every night, even under the worst conditions, suddenly, I was up until 5 AM with a mind that would not slow down. Blindsided and confused, I did not understand what was happening to me.

From never having to worry about sleep, it eventually became all I thought about. I would continue to suffer from debilitating insomnia for years. I became a shell of a person. For months on end, I couldn't muster more than 3-4 hours a night. My mental state deteriorated in every possible respect.

More context:

Like I said, I have always been a perfect sleeper. My general temperament had always been mellow— the kid who can knock out immediately anywhere, anytime. Planes, bumpy car drives, odd positions. Just... a chill temperament by nature, little to no anxiety, and *always* the most excellent sleeper.

Even when I had a reckless period of time in my late teens/early adulthood where I was regularly on a chemical cocktail that, yes, was extremely unhealthy, this pattern remained. I was pretty wild around when I graduated high school, and this was EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY, but I mention this only to tell you how flawless my sleep always has been even under the worst possible conditions/sleep hygiene.

I tell you truthfully and without hyperbole that, for a period of about a year or two, I was on many milligrams of Vyvanse (ADHD medication/stimulant) daily, while drinking coffee, while ingesting nicotine (that is three stimulants!) both vaped and sometimes in gum for the extra kick. I was taking Lexapro at the same time, smoking a lot of weed at the same time, often daily. I would go days without eating sometimes just to lose weight. I was on a severe caloric restriction, while working out like a horse.

The point of this isn't to analyze how unhealthy my lifestyle was. The point is to say: even through all of this, I still slept like a baby every night, somehow. I could go days without eating and sleep fine. I could take stimulant after stimulant at any time of day and sleep fine. I never, ever, ever had to worry about sleep — before, during, or for a time after this episode.

That behavior subsided, eventually.

Then? Something switched at 20 (a year or so after that insane behavior dissipated) that has long been a mystery to me. The insomnia began that aforementioned night. I didn't understand why. In hindsight, the only two things I can identify that changed are the following:

\- I began supplementing D3 daily

\- & I began taking CBD daily

**One critical variable: the very day the insomnia began, I started taking CBD oil.**

I never once considered that the CBD could have had any remote effect on my sleep. I considered it a net positive in every respect. To me, it was the one thing that I thought had any chance of helping. I took it daily, rigidly convinced I needed it.

Eventually, I began to accept my reality. I had a hard time sleeping. I began to adapt as well as I could. I went back to school and performed well enough, even on peanuts of sleep compared to what I used to get.

My mental state improved and I discovered things that could help, such as maintaining excellent sleep hygiene. My sleep was still very far from perfect— probably averaged 5-6 hours a night of broken up sleep. But I made do.

*(Let it be known: I ran the gamut of trying literally anything that could help. I added things and removed things. Magnesium, melatonin, sleep aids, everything under the sun. I read that D3 caused insomnia in some individuals, so I tried going without for a few weeks. There was zero measurable improvement, despite getting a blood test confirming that my D3 levels had dropped from 70 to about 50 as a result of the supplement's elimination.)*

However, never once did I even consider removing the CBD from the regimen.

That is, until several years later— I had a couple days where I felt so positive mentally that I felt I didn't need the CBD. I'm truly stunned at how rigid my behavior was— I'm definitely someone who could be accused of OCD-like thinking and behavior. I can get ensnared in rigid patterns of thinking and being in the world, so I really mean it when I tell you I never missed a single day of taking my CBD, convinced that it was the sole thing helping me get through the stress.

But, one day: I felt like I didn't need it, so I didn't take it. That night, despite incidentally poor sleep hygiene (was just too busy too late in the day to do my usual self-care), I slept near perfectly.

The same thing happened the next day.

I was a little stunned and confused... so, I looked into the pattern.

Lo and behold— somehow, I never discovered that CBD has been documented in research, and even clinical trials on Epidiolex (medically-prescribed CBD), to produce insomnia in certain individuals. *It is officially documented as a potential adverse reaction for Epidiolex.*

Further, It is noted that CBD:

\- Blocks adenosine receptors, which are crucial for feelings of sleepiness and tiredness

\- Is a POTENT inhibitor of the liver enzyme required to break down caffeine; therefore, if you drink coffee daily (which I do), the half-life of the caffeine ingested in the morning skyrockets. This can make it like having just had a cup of coffee at 8 PM.

I eliminated the CBD, and suddenly began... sleeping 8 hours again. Getting tired, turning off the lights, and just... falling asleep. I can't stress how big of a deal this is for me... I used to need to sit and watch TV for hours until I eventually nodded off. If I laid in the dark, I'd anxiously toss and turn for hours, wide awake.

To test, I re-introduced the CBD, and eventually the insomnia came back.

I am quite honestly floored. Ultimately, I am the idiot for my own rigid behavior and lack of serious research and insight. I should have realized that the day the insomnia started was the day I started taking the CBD oil and acted accordingly. But seriously: I never once considered that CBD could hurt sleep in any respect, in any capacity.

The truth is that it doesn't affect everyone the same, and for some, CBD can help; but my own n = 1 experience, along with backing from real research, corroborates the apparent fact that CBD can seriously hurt sleep in some individuals.

*CBD didn't ruin my life— but I may have ruined my life with CBD.*

Ultimately, I feel like I have my life back. I want to travel, I want to go camping, I want to do all the things that scared me before because I thought they would hurt my sleep. I feel free.

I know that this isn't the cure for many of you; however, if I myself found this post earlier, I may have saved myself from years of stress and insanity. It felt worth sharing. I wish you all the best.

And, I know I'm an idiot. Thank you.",0,1766777911.0,insomnia,4,0.5,False

The Justice Society: At some point Khufu was reincarnated in Carter Hall eventually becoming a vigilante superhero known as Hawkman formed the Justice Society in 1980 to fight crime and defend the world more effectively, joining Kent Nelson, a powerful sorcerer known as Doctor Fate, and Al Pratt, a vigilante with capabilities to alter his size according to his convenience known as Atom Smasher. The group mainly believes in fighting for truth and justice, having multiple adventures that would be reported by the media and gaining many fans in their glory days. Due to the adventures they had, they eventually became great friends, coming to regard the team as a family. Meanwhile Scientist in 1981 Hank Pym ,work for S.H.I.E.L.D. as a consultant and become the Ant-Man, fighting beside his own wife, Janet van Dyne, who operate as Wasp.


Hank's collaboration with Bill Foster and Elihas Starr on Project G.O.L.I.A.T.H. had ended in disaster when Starr’s obsession with the Quantum Realm crossed ethical lines. Pym shut the project down, destroyed what he could, and ruined Starr’s credibility to prevent the technology from spreading. 

Starr fled with his wife Catherine and daughter Ava, vanishing into Buenos Aires, where he continued his work in secret. 

Impressed by their effectiveness, Hawkman personally approached Pym and Janet, inviting them to join the Justice Society. 

Hank immediately refused. 

He disliked large teams, distrusted hero organizations, and bristled at the idea of sharing space with someone whose powers overlapped with his own,Al Pratt. Hank viewed Atom Smasher as redundant at best, reckless at worst. Janet saw the value in allies and urged Hank to reconsider. 

Tension between Pym and Pratt escalated until Hawkman proposed a solution: a sparring match.


Atom Smasher grew to colossal size, relying on sheer strength. Ant-Man countered with versatility,shrinking, growing, repositioning, exploiting angles and momentum. Hank proved what he needed to prove, outmaneuvering Pratt and forcing a clean victory. 

His ego satisfied, Hank finally agreed. 

Ant-Man and the Wasp officially joined the Justice Society !



Recognizing the value of a grounded operative and with the team expanding, Hawkman extended another invitation—this time to James “Bucky” Barnes, co-founder of S.H.I.E.L.D., war hero, and living relic of World War II. 

Now in his sixties, Barnes remained physically enhanced thanks to Zola’s experiments. He accepted Hawkman’s offer 
The Justice Society officially began working in coordination with S.H.I.E.L.D.


Bucky quietly searched intelligence networks for Diana of Themyscira, hoping Wonder Woman would join the team but he couldn't find her



With egos soothed and camaraderie growing, all five pledged to work together under S.H.I.E.L.D.’s command. Bucky made one more push to find Wonder Woman, but despite his efforts he could not locate her — instead, he dedicated himself to protecting his new teammates as best he could.


Their mission took them to Buenos Aires. S.H.I.E.L.D. intelligence had detected that Dr. Elihas Starr – bitter former colleague of Hank Pym – had resurfaced. 

Starr had built a hidden lab using stolen Quantum Realm technology. Under cover of night, the team gathered in a smoky downtown bar to observe. Janet (Wasp) and Hank (Ant-Man) joked over coffee and flirted quietly, while Doctor Fate’s helmet glowed faintly as he sipped tea and practiced focusing on subtle mystic currents. 

Fate sensed danger in the future and urged patience, but Ant-Man found Starr’s disappearance agonizing. Janet’s ants, each equipped with tiny EMP communicators, scouted outside, relaying whispers about Dr. Starr’s panic. Suddenly, Starr bolted. Hank and Janet vaulted over tables in pursuit, quickly joined by Hawkman, Atom Smasher, and Bucky. 

The chase tore through dark alleyways and industrial streets. Hawkman’s Nth-metal wings unfolded; he circled above like a vigilant hawk, his golden mace drawn. Bucky grabbed first one henchman with a well-placed punch, then flipped over the car hood that blocked their way, advancing on Starr’s retreat. 

Atom Smasher grew to giant height, trampling a parked truck that threatened to block the chase. Doctor Fate, using his mystic vision, silently muttered an incantation to foresee Starr’s next turn.


Despite this combined effort, Starr leaped into an abandoned warehouse yard and scrambled up a chain-link fence, nearly invisible in the shadows. Fate whispered to his teammates to get ready, that because the ennemy got a lab somewhere in that complex 

In the vast industrial compound guarded by machine-like men, the heroes split up. Ant-Man and Wasp shrank to the size of insects, gliding past outer guards on an ant-backed approach. Hawkman swooped down from above, incapacitating a sentry with a blunt thwack of his mace. Ant-Man’s colony of ants swarmed another guard, spelling “HELLO” with their tiny bodies on the cold concrete, just as Wasp re-expanded to full size and delivered a well-aimed energy blast that knocked a gun out of the last man’s hand. 

As gunfire erupted, the trio darted under cover. Atom Smasher, meanwhile, had grown to sixty feet and waded through debris toward the main building, drawing the attention of reinforcements. 

Bucky and Fate covered each other: Fate created spectral ankhs and magic barriers to shield Bucky from stray bullets as he nonchalantly tossed knocking-out gas grenades 

Inside the underground lab, the team finally surrounded Starr’s Quantum Tunnel. Hank recognized the gleaming device: a dimensional gateway powered by unstable energies. Dr. Starr, panicked and wild-eyed, clutched a control lever said that his machien was working. Nearby, Catherine Starr clutched at the console, hands trembling. 

Little Ava (Ghost in the future) peeked from behind her mother, terrified. Fate’s eyes glowed under the Helmet of Fate as he cast a sudden illusion: the entire room shimmered with multiple possible futures, revealing the deadly collapse of the Tunnel. In a grave voice audible only to the team, Fate warned to stop him now or people will die. 

Bucky took the lead on neutralizing Starr. With clinical precision from his soldier’s training, he rushed forward, tackling Catherine out of harm’s way just as she tried to flee. Wasp darted at Starr, tiny again, deploying an energy stinger to hit the lever on the control panel. Atom Smasher, still giant, raised a fist to smash the quantum engine’s core. 

As the machinery protested, Fate formed a protective mystic forcefield around Ava to keep her intact. Hank, however, yelled to Janet to not touch the lever yet because he feared the Reactor would overload. But the chaos was too great; Starr was frantic, Catherine hysterical. A stray bullet ignited a spark, and alarm klaxons blared.



Suddenly the quantum tunnel pulled itself out of sync. A BRILLIANT BLAST of Quantum energy erupted. Fate was momentarily stunned by the temporal feedback; Hawkman’s mace deflected flying debris that would have hit Ava. Ant-Man clung to a giant ant, desperately trying to hold onto Catherine as a violent implosion began. Bucky shouted for everyone to go 

Doctor Fate’s premonition grants them split-seconds to act differently – he teleports Catherine and Ava to safety mere moments before the Tunnel’s overload. Hawkman and Wasp hold it together long enough for Hank to reverse the power flow. Starr is subdued rather than vaporized, sorrowful but alive. 


Hank studies Ava closely as Fate confirms the strength of her quantum signature.
S.H.I.E.L.D. officers step forward to secure the area and prepare for debriefing. 

The team prepares to depart before the press overtakes the site.





Within forty-eight hours, the Justice Society, Ant-Man, and the Wasp were back on U.S. soil, debriefing inside a reinforced S.H.I.E.L.D. safe facility. The official report framed Buenos Aires as a joint containment success, but privately, the consequences ran deeper.


• Elihas Starr still alive unlike his MCU counterpart was placed under indefinite house arrest with full medical supervision. His obsession was gone,burned out by terror and guilt. Hank visited him once. They didn’t reconcile, but they did something more important: they closed the wound. 

Ava (Ghost from Ant-Man & The Wasp) didn’t become a S.H.I.E.L.D. weapon and instead
Doctor Fate insisted she remain with her parents, Nd Bill Foster was brought in quietly as a mentor and engineer. Janet volunteered time with Ava and Bucky became Ava’s anchor. 

When Ava phased involuntarily panic flickering her between solid and intangible,Bucky stayed still, talking her through it with steady, grounded words. 

By the end of the year,Ava could control her intangibility for several minutes at a time
S.H.I.E.L.D. still wants her. Badly but Hawkman,Bucky and Fate blocked them every time.



During the events of WW 1984 Lord begins to grant wishes
in exchange for whatever he takes. After an audience with Ronald Reagan, he
discovers a satellite broadcast system and he takes it in exchange for more nuclear weapons. The Russians quickly discover this and declare a nuclear
war against the United States. 


Prince and Trevor attempt to stop Lord once again but Minerva, who refuses to give up her powers, stops the two and lets Lord escape. The Justice Society noticing all of the nukes being launched into the air and the destruction of the world. Seeming imminent the team makes their Last Stand

Carter knocked one into the ocean with his mace. Doctor Fate banished one into a temporary pocket dimension. 

Hank and Janet each wrapped rockets in shrinking fields, slowing their speed.  Al smashed an ICBM out of the sky with a fist the size of a house. 

Most of the Justice Society is able to take out the nukes that they see with wasp
being the only one having trouble with hers. 

Hank arrives to help Her and they then grappled onto the missile and tried to disarm it in mid-flight. Knowing the only way to disarm it was to go inside, they tried to cut through the plating, but it was too thick, leaving them with the only other option of shrinking between the molecules.
With threats of a nuclear war underway and Lord reaching absolute control, Trevor convinces Prince to renounce her wish, which she reluctantly does. With her powers fully restored, she dons the armor of Asteria and confronts Minerva, who has now become an ""apex predator"".



After subduing Minerva, she confronts Lord, who has already begun granting wishes around the world. He manages to hold Prince off, but Prince uses the Lasso of Truth to convince the world to fucking somehow renounce their wishes. 

Meanwhile with Hank and Janet,they both knew that in doing so, there would be no returning. Ant-Man tried, but his regulator was damaged, so Wasp decided to make the sacrifice herself, as hers wasn't damaged. She told Ant-Man to tell Hope she loved her, before turning off her regulator and going inside the missile, despite Ant-Man's desperate cries. Meanwhile while distracted, Prince uses the lasso to show Lord a vision of
his son amidst the chaos which he brought upon, which finally convinces Lord to renounce his wish and reunite with his
son.



As Janet shrinks down the missile disappears Ant-Man flies down not understanding what happened as Hawkman swoops down to save him the ream wonders what just happened why is all the chaos disappearing. 

They discover that Wonder Woman reappeared after decades and somehow managed to convince the world to renounce their wishes once Hank realizes that Janet basically died for nothing he loses it he is hysterical and completely gives up on heroism he ditches his Ant-Man costume and leaves the Justice Society attempting to spend the months finding a way to save Janet from the quantum realm the whole incident leaves the society scarred and Janet's death leads the team disbanding.


Kent Nelson resigned from thr team and 
his work as a hero, sheltering in the Tower of Fate to achieve inner peace without having to resort to wearing the Helmet of
Fate.With his wife seemingly gone forever,
Pym was forced to return to his home, where he informed his daughter that
her mother would not be returning home.
Hank threw himself into lab work and searching quantum physics texts, trying to find any edge that might let him retrieve his wife from the Quantum Realm.

1pwcwtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1pwcwtc/trying_to_trust_mil_more_with_second_postpartum/,Trying to trust MIL more with second postpartum,"Like many, I had a good relationship with my MIL until I became a mom. I'm trying to mend this and have a better relationship with her moving forward. We are about to have our second baby in the spring, when our first child will be about 2 years old.

My husband's mother is an incredibly capable person and I know that she brings a lot to our family. She raised four children, she has a background in early childhood education, and she helps the little cousins that live in her hometown currently. She's in her '60s and fit as a fiddle! My toddler also adores her and she takes incredibly good care of him when she visits now. She is very careful to always respect what I ask of her, and is very differential to me. She knows how to play this game.

For background, when I had my first, she made a lot of missteps that really damaged my trust. She texted me and called me several times before the baby was born and told me that she was going to ""baby-hog"" when she got to our house (in their family, that means holding the baby for more than your fair share.) Unfortunately, that really set me on edge and made me super protective and defensive of my baby. I felt like she just hovered around me that whole first visit with my newborn. She would tell me ""Let me know when you're done and I will go in"" like no, I'm with my baby right now, why don't you just be helpful around the house? That first visit was just truly awful. I had prepped so much food that just needed to be put in the oven, and I remember coming down for breakfast one morning \*on my actual birthday\*, where I had put out a breakfast casserole and just asked someone to put it in the oven- no one put it in the oven, but everyone was sitting at the table waiting for me to start cooking breakfast. It was an actual nightmare, and really just doesn't seem very characteristic of her because she's usually such a helper. She also encouraged me to breastfeed in front of my father-in-law, despite my telling her that I wasn't super comfortable- her response was ""oh, he sees stuff all the time because he volunteers the hospital."" Well, I think that gives you the perspective that she didn't realize that I, the new mom learning to breastfeed, wasn't comfortable whipping my boobs out and doing this new skill in front of him. I know she was just trying to say hey. It's not a big deal, don't feel like you have to go hide in your bedroom to nurse him. But I felt invalidated that she didn't consider MY comfort.

Anyways, fast forward a few years, we have definitely had a few uncomfortable moments in parenthood where where she said some very judgmental things that she doesn't realize come across as judgmental. Like telling me I might be causing an eating disorder in my 8 month old child...telling me this at 545am before I have had coffee when it was just the two of us and she knew she could get her barb in. 

I have put my foot down several times telling her like ""hey, can you just chill? I am a new mom and I'm getting my feet underneath me. Please give me some space.""

Most recently, she and father-in-law watched our toddler for a full week while we went on a babymoon. Yes, this was absolutely miraculous and I did truly trust her to take really good care of him the whole time. While she was visiting, she was definitely campaigning to get some time up here with our newborn when they arrive in the spring. And right now, I'm just not sure how I feel about all of that. I have a very hard time trusting her in the vulnerable postpartum weeks. I am prone to anxiety and depression, and sleep deprivation takes a very significant toll on my mental health very quickly. I'm just not myself those first few weeks and months, and I know it.

I definitely don't want her coming up for the first month or so, but after that, where does she fit in? Should she visit when Dad goes back to work at 6 weeks? That means it will just be her, me, my toddler, and a newborn.... I usually like my husband around as a buffer because I feel like she is so INTENSE and just so eager that she tries to get ahead of me in mothering and I will just be competing with her all day. Last summer, when our baby was probably 5 months, I remember her saying that she was probably the most maternal person who had ever lived. Saying that in my presence, as a new mom, that she was just the MOST maternal. What the actual fuck.

My own mom is coming, and I know that with her I can relax and say ""no, I haven't started lunch.... no I haven't started laundry, can you please help me"" But with MIL, it feels like everything needs to be done because she is mothering competitively.

She has put a lot into building a better relationship with me, and she does take excellent care of my son. I just don't want to get into an uncomfortable situation where she is planned to stay with us for a full week, and by the third day she's driving me crazy and I just want some space. She's unfortunately the type of person who will just start telling you how SHE did things and why that was such a good solution, when you are definitely not asking for advice. I also don't want to ice her out because she doesn't deserve that and I know I could use the help.

Hey everyone,

I’m in my early 30s, ex-Muslim for over 10 years now, and I’ve recently moved to London. The move itself has been good, but if I’m honest, it’s been a pretty lonely transition so far. The London meet ups just don't seem to happen anymore and I joined my local areas's meet up spaces but not a lot of traction even with the run clubs.

I don’t really have an ex-Muslim (or even just “gets it”) circle here yet, and I miss having people I can talk to openly without filtering parts of myself. I’m not looking for debates or trauma-bonding — just genuine connection, shared experiences, and maybe the odd laugh about how weird life can be after leaving religion behind. I have close friends but they're busy with either work/life in general/kids/relationship etc. We speak often but seldom meet up and as someone who works from home it's difficult despite having nice housemates.

I’d be up for chatting over phone/video first, and ideally meeting in person if we get along. Coffee, walks, casual hangs — nothing intense. I’m based in London and open to meeting people of any background as long as you’re kind and respectful. I am still single lol aged 30 if any girl likes my profile pic or muscles lol.

1pwcmah,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/25/trump-labor-unions-afl-cio,US labor unions gear up to fight against Trump’s ‘Billionaire First’ agenda,"Donald Trump has staged a year of “unrelenting attacks on working people,” according to the head of the largest federation of the labor unions in the US. Now they’re preparing to fight back.

Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said it was gearing up to challenge the US president’s “Billionaire First” agenda in 2026 – and drive candidates in key elections to stand up for “struggling” Americans.

In an interview with the Guardian, she described how the federation has pushed to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers, and filed lawsuits against the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken unions and worker protections. “People were pissed,” said Shuler.

The House of Representatives passed a bill on 11 December that would restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers in response to Trump’s executive orders that stripped the rights from more than 1 million federal government employees.

“It was through a lot of good old-fashioned organizing,” said Shuler, who accused the president of overseeing “the biggest attack on unions in our history” by moving to eliminate collective bargaining for federal workers.

The AFL-CIO is now steeling itself for a fight to pass the bill in the Senate in January, kicking off what it likely to be another hectic year. The threat of another government shutdown looms at the end of January. The fight over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies is far from over.

“We’re organizing as we speak,” said Shuler. “We can move actual people, in workplaces, in every city, in every state, across the country.”

Affordability has come into sharp focus, with inflation still stubbornly above typical levels, and many Americans grappling with rising bills and prices. The federation intends to build momentum into the 2026 midterm elections on such kitchen table issues, according to Shuler, who said labor organizations were already reaching out to working people, canvassing and knocking on doors, in an effort to break through the noise.

“People are fed up,” she said. “They’re saturated. I think they’re distrustful of institutions and the media. All of the folks that we have come to rely on over the years seem to be waning in trust, and there’s only one organization left that people do trust, and that’s the labor movement, unions. Our credibility and trust is actually going up. And so we think that we have to capitalize on what our sweet spot is, which is using our sphere of influence.”

About 68% of Americans support labor unions, according to Gallup, despite a downward trend of union density in the US over the past several decades, which has correlated with the growth of income inequality.

Trump promised to lower costs on day one and create good jobs, especially in manufacturing, noted Shuler. Those promises have not yet been fulfilled. Trump described apprehension over affordability as a “hoax”, and sought to downplay economic concerns such as the sputtering job market.

“That’s not what people are experiencing,” Shuler said of Trump’s narrative. “They’re having to run up their credit-card debt. It’s at an all-time high, just to afford groceries. They’re looking at how they’re going to make their car payment, how they’re going to afford rent.

“When I’m out on the road talking to people, housing and healthcare are two issues everybody is feeling. And that is not on the ‘Billionaire First’ agenda.”

Trump is “rewarding the big corporations and the rich” while many Americans are “actually struggling”, she added. “I think that’s going to come into sharper focus as we go on into 2026. And that is what the labor movement is going to be very clear on. What are workers’ demands? Who is standing with us when it comes to candidates, and elected officials? And which side are you on?”

Thousands of Starbucks baristas are currently on strike, as they campaign for the world’s largest coffee chain to grant them their first union contract.

“This strike has really brought it in sharp focus, this divide that we’re seeing of an economy that’s working for the very rich, for the billionaires, the corporations and working people are piecing it together,” said Shuler. “They’re often working two or three jobs just to get by.

“The future of this economy is absolutely in peril, if you think about how inequality is rampant, but also AI and advanced technology is going to continue to create this divide between the ultra rich and everyday people just trying to make a living.

“It’s only going to get worse if we don’t get the guardrails in place, have more power for working people to negotiate what they need and bring some balance back into our economy.”

I was at my local pharmacy yesterday, and instead of the usual 40-minute wait with 20 people crammed in a tiny space, I scanned a QR code and... that's it. I went to a coffee shop next door.

**The platform is called Tokins and here's why it's insane:**

🔥 **No app download** \- Just scan the QR code with your phone camera. That's it. Boom, you're in the queue.

📱 **You get a digital tokin number** \- Like #12 or whatever, and you can literally SEE your position moving in real-time. ""Position 8 of 15... Position 5 of 15..."" It's oddly satisfying.

🔔 **SMS + automated calls** \- They text you when you're close, and if you somehow miss it, they literally CALL you. I've never missed my turn.

💊 **For pharmacies: Just snap your prescription** \- Upload a photo of your prescription through the interface. No more explaining to the pharmacist while everyone behind you sighs.

💳 **Pay online for priority** \- I paid online and got bumped to the front. Got my meds in 12 minutes total vs the usual hour.

📊 **Works EVERYWHERE** \- Once you're in the system, you can use it at ANY shop that has Tokins. Same account, zero friction.

**Real talk:** I used this at a salon last week too. Selected my stylist, booked a slot, got notified when she was ready. Walked in at the exact time with zero wait.

The crazy part? The shop owner told me they also use it for inventory tracking, staff management, and even run email campaigns from the same dashboard. It's like... their entire business OS?

**Why this matters:**

* No more standing in crowded spaces
* No more ""is it my turn yet?"" anxiety
* Freedom to actually DO STUFF while waiting
* Works across pharmacies, retail stores, clinics, salons, even government offices

I genuinely think this could be huge. Like, why are we still standing in physical lines in 2026?

Has anyone else tried this? Am I late to the party or is this genuinely new?

**Edit:** Holy crap, this blew up! Some FAQs:

* **Is this India only?** \- Started in India but concept works globally
* **What if shop doesn't have it?** \- You can actually suggest shops to join the platform
* **Privacy concerns?** \- They use standard SMS, no weird permissions needed
* **Cost?** \- FREE for customers. Shops pay a subscription

I was always sitting alone at a different table. I wanted to approach her, but wasn’t sure how. 

it looked like maybe she had earbuds in so I usually take that as a sign of someone not wanting to be disturbed. I know women complain a lot when men try to talk to them while they’re busy, reading, have headphones in, etc. and say that’s a “sign” to leave them alone. I don’t want to assume it’s different and automatically fine just because i’m also a woman. 

as I was leaving I did say I liked her style and to have a good day. that’s when it was confirmed she \*did\* have earbuds in because she had to pull them out to hear me. when I was walking out the door I wondered if maybe a friendship could’ve started there. but I don’t want to bother someone when they’re just trying to enjoy some quiet time alone with a cup of coffee. I know someone sitting alone isn’t an invitation to offer company. 

sooo what do you do in this scenario? I got strong queer vibes (I was I was giving off those too). but she didn’t seem like she wanted to be approached because of ear buds and reading? or maybe she wouldn’t have minded? i’m also diagnosed autistic and awful at reading cues so i’m extra careful to not overstep.

1pwckjp,https://i.redd.it/7vx7o5b5nl9g1.png,Fill in the Blanks,"The tune of the cuckoo clock, with a jarringly postmodern, EDM remix, rang painfully close to her ears.

She woke up with a start, hair in her disoriented eyes, groping for her phone to put an end to the miserable sound. It was 9 o’clock. She was supposed to be at work right now. 

Holly was late. There was this whole presentation about a plan to roll out composite packaging instead of plastic jars for the healthy snacking brand she worked for. Her boss had entrusted her with it and she expected Holly to present it today. 

Holly considered herself, in her own words, to be a “spontaneous young lady”. She had been an amazing saleswoman in her day, chased the greatest targets at every company, hopped a ton of jobs too quickly to be trusted, yet every interview she gave was perfect. She was about to make short work of this presentation, maybe improvising it would impress Miranda more than her being overly prepared. 

As she thought of openers and witty punchlines, she brushed her teeth. Alcohol still on her breath, come what may, she would still face some music for being late. 

She wasn’t always like this. Holly was a focussed woman, married to her career and the legendary corporate ladder. The last few hours had been a blur and the more she tried to remember, the longer that time frame of amnesia got. With a half-eaten apple in hand, she opened the door and stepped into her prized 5.0 Mustang. 

The apartment building’s parking lot roared, in resonance with the engine, but it couldn’t compare to how loud the thoughts in Holly’s brain were. For someone with a plan of “winging it”, today was a day of overthinking and self-doubt as well.

Holly wasn’t really a “young” woman. She was well into her forties, perhaps still young in spirit. She had no family left, no children or a husband, except when she was briefly married to her high school boyfriend, Josh. 

After a very intoxicated and irresponsible graduation night, she was with Josh, at City Hall the next morning, with a keyring on her finger, taken from his motorcycle keys. It didn’t last, as the booze of youth wore off. She had dreams, something to prove to herself, and a teen marriage only came in the way of college. She rarely thought of him these days, wondering what became of him when she moved away.

The brakes squealed as the 5.0 halted in the parking lot. She scrambled under the seat for her heels and dragged herself out with her briefcase and handbag.

The incoming clatter of her urgent pace caught the attention of the receptionist, who, in the 18 months she’d been at the company, was now her ally at work. 

Mike, a very bubbly young man in his twenties, gave her a pretentious grin. Holly found him to be exasperating and painfully sarcastic.

“You must be here for your things, Miranda asked me to clear your desk, because ‘Miss Holly deserves her whiny little tantrum every now and then’... ”, Mike said in a falsetto, mimicking their boss. It was obviously a joke, knowing Miranda, that is far from how she would put it.

“Clear my desk? What?”

“That’s what they ask you to do when you show up to work, drunk, on the day of a presentation. Wait, you don’t remember?!”

“But, that’s today, today is… “

“Friday! My deadbeat father was better at showing up, you know? Anyways, here’s your stuff.”, he said, handing over a cardboard box containing her things. “You were too wasted yesterday to collect it.”

“What’re you gonna do now? Forget that, just leave, because if Miranda sees me chatting with you, I’m next. Text me!”, Mike said, almost shooing her away from the desk.

Holly took two steps away, forgetting to breathe, the box resting in the loose grip of her arms. She felt time bend the space around her, to the point where all she could feel was her racing heart.

Today wasn’t Thursday. Yesterday wasn’t Wednesday.

She had been knocked out for a while.


Holly stormed off, humiliated, and reached the parking lot. She couldn’t really say anything to Mike, as the events of the last 24 hours weren’t exactly registered in her conscious tape of mental footage. Not many cars were parked and her Foxbody 5.0 stood alone in her now-former parking spot, the engine still hot from the hasty, spirited drive to work earlier.

Holly had never been fired before. It was an unusual feeling. Calling Miranda would be a good idea, an apology could maybe save her position at the snack company. But there were more pressing matters at hand. She stashed the box on the passenger seat and tightened her grip around the steering wheel.


The frustration of having an unknowably bad day, not just today, but yesterday as well, was a vortex of self-destructive hypotheses. Bashing her head against the wheel, her ugly-crying could barely be heard from outside, but in the cabin, the void of amnesia was sucking away at her wits. 

She knew of the blank spaces in her memory, but now, when they actually came to bite her, she realised how little she actually remembered.

Closing her teary eyes and crunching the days of the week in her head, she remembered what Wednesday night was spent doing. 

She remembered getting off work and going to a bar nearby to drink alone. Miranda had been a real pain in the ass that day, probably something about that presentation. Holly’s usual joint was the one not far from her apartment building. Driving in near autopilot, she left the office complex and headed to the bar in search of answers.

She drove with no variation in speed, plain shifts and light feet. Her limbs moved robotically about the wheel and pedals, while her mind wandered within itself, searching for the next clue. After an eternity and 20 minutes, she was there at the bar. She parked in the nearly empty parking lot, understandably so, it was about 10 in the morning.


Katie’s was Holly’s comfort zone, which she visited about thrice a week. It was a dimly lit, warm and tastefully decorated establishment. Katie was probably the first friend Holly made when she came to the city. Katie was right there, polishing her glasses, a few daytime regulars chuckling in celebration of wilful unemployment, Holly wasn’t all that very different from them, for now. The TV was running a news channel on low volume.

“Hey Kat! Guess what, I got wasted and my boss fired me like, yesterday.”

“Yesterday? I’d drink to that! Shoulda seen you yesterday then! Where were you?”

“The thing is, I don’t know. Didn’t even know I was fired until this morning.”

“I’m happy you took a break yesterday, because the day before, you really overdid it.”

“I did, huh?” Her voice cracked. “Can you… “ Holly slumped into her arms resting on the table. 

“I’ll fix you coffee, gimme a sec”, Kat said, gently touching her shoulder and rubbing it in hopes of reassuring her.

“I’m such a mess.” Holly sniffled and said in a muffled voice, head snuggled in her arms still. 

She really was a mess.

Katie’s was pretty much the only constant of today. The jobless grunts laughing at trashy jokes, the TV chattering away, Kat being on toes, running her struggling establishment. She was a 50 year old bar owner who tended to all who still desired to visit this corner of the bustling city, in search of certain ‘vibes’ and getting drunk. The competition was fierce.

Holly looked up when the mug of brew was placed at her elbow and put it to her lips, not bawling anymore. Perhaps caffeine held the keys to what remained locked. The news anchor was doing the morning city newsflash.

“...Robertson denies all allegations of appearing in the files, states ‘he was just an acquaintance’ “
“The bank on the 21st street was robbed Thursday morning 5:33 a.m., when two masked criminals stormed in with firearms as seen on camera. The robbers opened fire on the police, who rushed to the scene as soon as the manager notified them. One suspect was shot and killed, now identified as one ‘Joshua Tompson’, but the other fled the scene and is still at large with the stolen cash.”
“Micheal Tarry, the man who attempted the assassination of the DA, has finally been sentenced to life imprisonment.”
“The Italian grocery store on the 11th street announced a clearance sale on cheese wheels, much to the locals’ disappointment the cheese has been found to be long expired. The owners admit to such ‘clearance scams’ being done before, blame the pandemic for lost inventory and customers.”
“Mark Cooper, rising Hollywood star in preparation for a meet and greet at Westside Nature Park, was attacked by hornets after accidentally disturbing the hive, hospitalised and now stable, recovering from 73 sting injuries from the near-fatal encounter…”

The monotonous voice of that horrible anchor was interrupted by Kat.

“Holly, just go home, get some sleep. You’ll figure this out. Hey, maybe you can give what’s-his-name a call when you’re better. He seemed nice.”

“Who? Who is what's-his-name?”

“It was just some dude you left with on Wednesday, remember? He said he was new in town and y’all ‘went waaay back’, remember? How’d it go with him?”

“Uh, who? I can’t recall.”

“Girl… You know what? Nevermind, he didn’t seem like your type anyway. Just go home and allow yourself to heal. Positive vibes only, okay?”


Holly felt better. The coffee yanked some spirit into her. The mountain of winding theories came crashing down. She just had a bad hook-up on a weeknight. Just some swindling man in search of prey drunk and lonely enough to take home, but like every one-night-stand Holly had ever had, it led to nothing. It was a pitiable thing that she hated herself for indulging in, but a much kinder explanation to her behaviour, in contrast to the things she had imagined. 

The gaps were filled now, she thought. A disastrous hook-up on Wednesday night, morning drunkenness and lashing out at Miranda yesterday, all events leading up to: waking up today. The loop was complete now. Ignoring her unnervingly suspicious instinct, telling her a piece was missing, she settled for this theory. She gave herself a nod of satisfaction and left the bar shortly after thanking Katie.

Holly felt like pampering herself today. She went to a supermarket and bought some groceries. She needed to cook for herself, to clear her mind. It was therapy for her. And maybe, contemplate the next big move for her career. She needed some time alone. With a large bag of groceries in hand, Holly managed a wry grin at the cashier and walked to her car in the parking lot. She was relieved. Back in control.

Things felt fixed. A minor rough patch, that happens to everyone. Two reckless days, being fired from a job. Nothing unrecoverable, in fact on her way to recovery already. 

Holly cracked open the boot to put the bag of groceries in. It squeaked open to reveal a duffel bag sitting plump on the mat. Confused, she unzipped it.

Money. Bundles and bundles of cash, an ocean of it, contained neatly within a duffel bag in the boot of her car.

Am I wrong for wanting to use it now?,"My wife and I have been married for over 14 years and we have 3 kids, all under 10. Many years ago, before we even had our first child, my wife cheated on me with a coworker. Our marriage was sort going through a rough patch at the time, but the affair still shocked me badly.

I seriously considered leaving. What stopped me was how hard she worked to reconcile. She went sober, quit her job, went to therapy, read books/listened to podcasts about infidelity, and took full accountability without minimizing anything. I decided to try to work through it.

One thing I never fully got over was the sexual aspect. My wife was pretty much my first and only partner, and the idea of her being with someone else sexually really messed with me. I told her upfront that if we were going to reconcile, I needed a one time hall pass. She was really hesitant about it but ultimately agreed because she really wanted to save the marriage. I poured a lot of energy into the gym, fitness, and getting myself together mentally and physically, but also to cash in the hall pass.

However our relationship genuinely improved after reconciliation. I honestly stopped thinking about the hall pass over time. My wife would occasionally ask about it, and I always told her I wasn’t interested anymore and that was the truth. She seemed really relieved and happy, and life moved on. We had three kids and, by most measures, our marriage has been solid.

Last year, I met a woman at a restaurant while I was out having dinner. She came up to me and said she thought I was cute. Normally, I shut things like that down immediately, and I have in the past. This time I didn’t and to be honest, it was because she was really beautiful but also because of resentment. I thought: my wife had someone else inside her, why am I supposed to be above even talking to someone?

I told this woman upfront that I’m married with three kids. She’s also in a long term relationship. We exchanged numbers, and that was supposed to be it.

But she kept texting me a lot. Over the next few weeks, then months, we started meeting up maybe once every couple of weeks, library, park, coffee, lunch etc. Nothing overtly physical at first. She also has a history of being cheated on by a partner, which we bonded over. The physical side barely progressed beyond hugs and holding hands. She brings in homemade snacks and desserts often, and also really likes writing love letters etc.

Last week, she told me she’s in love with me and wants to kiss me badly. We both acknowledge this would be a secret and that neither of us plans to leave our partners. I made that boundary clear and told her upfront we can never leave our partners.

Am I “entitled” to cash in that hall pass now, even though it’s years later? Technically, this wouldn’t be taking time away from my family, we see each other maybe once every two weeks. I haven’t kissed or been with anyone besides my wife in my entire life, so I will admit that really adds to the allure.",0,1766776821.0,AskMenAdvice,296,0.48,False
1pwchji,https://i.redd.it/3h50jvliml9g1.png,Fill in the Blanks,"The tune of the cuckoo clock, with a jarringly postmodern, EDM remix, rang painfully close to her ears.

She woke up with a start, hair in her disoriented eyes, groping for her phone to put an end to the miserable sound. It was 9 o’clock. She was supposed to be at work right now. 

Holly was late. There was this whole presentation about a plan to roll out composite packaging instead of plastic jars for the healthy snacking brand she worked for. Her boss had entrusted her with it and she expected Holly to present it today. 

Holly considered herself, in her own words, to be a “spontaneous young lady”. She had been an amazing saleswoman in her day, chased the greatest targets at every company, hopped a ton of jobs too quickly to be trusted, yet every interview she gave was perfect. She was about to make short work of this presentation, maybe improvising it would impress Miranda more than her being overly prepared. 

As she thought of openers and witty punchlines, she brushed her teeth. Alcohol still on her breath, come what may, she would still face some music for being late. 

She wasn’t always like this. Holly was a focussed woman, married to her career and the legendary corporate ladder. The last few hours had been a blur and the more she tried to remember, the longer that time frame of amnesia got. With a half-eaten apple in hand, she opened the door and stepped into her prized 5.0 Mustang. 

The apartment building’s parking lot roared, in resonance with the engine, but it couldn’t compare to how loud the thoughts in Holly’s brain were. For someone with a plan of “winging it”, today was a day of overthinking and self-doubt as well.

Holly wasn’t really a “young” woman. She was well into her forties, perhaps still young in spirit. She had no family left, no children or a husband, except when she was briefly married to her high school boyfriend, Josh. 

After a very intoxicated and irresponsible graduation night, she was with Josh, at City Hall the next morning, with a keyring on her finger, taken from his motorcycle keys. It didn’t last, as the booze of youth wore off. She had dreams, something to prove to herself, and a teen marriage only came in the way of college. She rarely thought of him these days, wondering what became of him when she moved away.

The brakes squealed as the 5.0 halted in the parking lot. She scrambled under the seat for her heels and dragged herself out with her briefcase and handbag.

The incoming clatter of her urgent pace caught the attention of the receptionist, who, in the 18 months she’d been at the company, was now her ally at work. 

Mike, a very bubbly young man in his twenties, gave her a pretentious grin. Holly found him to be exasperating and painfully sarcastic.

“You must be here for your things, Miranda asked me to clear your desk, because ‘Miss Holly deserves her whiny little tantrum every now and then’... ”, Mike said in a falsetto, mimicking their boss. It was obviously a joke, knowing Miranda, that is far from how she would put it.

“Clear my desk? What?”

“That’s what they ask you to do when you show up to work, drunk, on the day of a presentation. Wait, you don’t remember?!”

“But, that’s today, today is… “

“Friday! My deadbeat father was better at showing up, you know? Anyways, here’s your stuff.”, he said, handing over a cardboard box containing her things. “You were too wasted yesterday to collect it.”

“What’re you gonna do now? Forget that, just leave, because if Miranda sees me chatting with you, I’m next. Text me!”, Mike said, almost shooing her away from the desk.

Holly took two steps away, forgetting to breathe, the box resting in the loose grip of her arms. She felt time bend the space around her, to the point where all she could feel was her racing heart.

Today wasn’t Thursday. Yesterday wasn’t Wednesday.

She had been knocked out for a while.


Holly stormed off, humiliated, and reached the parking lot. She couldn’t really say anything to Mike, as the events of the last 24 hours weren’t exactly registered in her conscious tape of mental footage. Not many cars were parked and her Foxbody 5.0 stood alone in her now-former parking spot, the engine still hot from the hasty, spirited drive to work earlier.

Holly had never been fired before. It was an unusual feeling. Calling Miranda would be a good idea, an apology could maybe save her position at the snack company. But there were more pressing matters at hand. She stashed the box on the passenger seat and tightened her grip around the steering wheel.


The frustration of having an unknowably bad day, not just today, but yesterday as well, was a vortex of self-destructive hypotheses. Bashing her head against the wheel, her ugly-crying could barely be heard from outside, but in the cabin, the void of amnesia was sucking away at her wits. 

She knew of the blank spaces in her memory, but now, when they actually came to bite her, she realised how little she actually remembered.

Closing her teary eyes and crunching the days of the week in her head, she remembered what Wednesday night was spent doing. 

She remembered getting off work and going to a bar nearby to drink alone. Miranda had been a real pain in the ass that day, probably something about that presentation. Holly’s usual joint was the one not far from her apartment building. Driving in near autopilot, she left the office complex and headed to the bar in search of answers.

She drove with no variation in speed, plain shifts and light feet. Her limbs moved robotically about the wheel and pedals, while her mind wandered within itself, searching for the next clue. After an eternity and 20 minutes, she was there at the bar. She parked in the nearly empty parking lot, understandably so, it was about 10 in the morning.


Katie’s was Holly’s comfort zone, which she visited about thrice a week. It was a dimly lit, warm and tastefully decorated establishment. Katie was probably the first friend Holly made when she came to the city. Katie was right there, polishing her glasses, a few daytime regulars chuckling in celebration of wilful unemployment, Holly wasn’t all that very different from them, for now. The TV was running a news channel on low volume.

“Hey Kat! Guess what, I got wasted and my boss fired me like, yesterday.”

“Yesterday? I’d drink to that! Shoulda seen you yesterday then! Where were you?”

“The thing is, I don’t know. Didn’t even know I was fired until this morning.”

“I’m happy you took a break yesterday, because the day before, you really overdid it.”

“I did, huh?” Her voice cracked. “Can you… “ Holly slumped into her arms resting on the table. 

“I’ll fix you coffee, gimme a sec”, Kat said, gently touching her shoulder and rubbing it in hopes of reassuring her.

“I’m such a mess.” Holly sniffled and said in a muffled voice, head snuggled in her arms still. 

She really was a mess.

Katie’s was pretty much the only constant of today. The jobless grunts laughing at trashy jokes, the TV chattering away, Kat being on toes, running her struggling establishment. She was a 50 year old bar owner who tended to all who still desired to visit this corner of the bustling city, in search of certain ‘vibes’ and getting drunk. The competition was fierce.

Holly looked up when the mug of brew was placed at her elbow and put it to her lips, not bawling anymore. Perhaps caffeine held the keys to what remained locked. The news anchor was doing the morning city newsflash.

“...Robertson denies all allegations of appearing in the files, states ‘he was just an acquaintance’ “
“The bank on the 21st street was robbed Thursday morning 5:33 a.m., when two masked criminals stormed in with firearms as seen on camera. The robbers opened fire on the police, who rushed to the scene as soon as the manager notified them. One suspect was shot and killed, now identified as one ‘Joshua Tompson’, but the other fled the scene and is still at large with the stolen cash.”
“Micheal Tarry, the man who attempted the assassination of the DA, has finally been sentenced to life imprisonment.”
“The Italian grocery store on the 11th street announced a clearance sale on cheese wheels, much to the locals’ disappointment the cheese has been found to be long expired. The owners admit to such ‘clearance scams’ being done before, blame the pandemic for lost inventory and customers.”
“Mark Cooper, rising Hollywood star in preparation for a meet and greet at Westside Nature Park, was attacked by hornets after accidentally disturbing the hive, hospitalised and now stable, recovering from 73 sting injuries from the near-fatal encounter…”

The monotonous voice of that horrible anchor was interrupted by Kat.

“Holly, just go home, get some sleep. You’ll figure this out. Hey, maybe you can give what’s-his-name a call when you’re better. He seemed nice.”

“Who? Who is what's-his-name?”

“It was just some dude you left with on Wednesday, remember? He said he was new in town and y’all ‘went waaay back’, remember? How’d it go with him?”

“Uh, who? I can’t recall.”

“Girl… You know what? Nevermind, he didn’t seem like your type anyway. Just go home and allow yourself to heal. Positive vibes only, okay?”


Holly felt better. The coffee yanked some spirit into her. The mountain of winding theories came crashing down. She just had a bad hook-up on a weeknight. Just some swindling man in search of prey drunk and lonely enough to take home, but like every one-night-stand Holly had ever had, it led to nothing. It was a pitiable thing that she hated herself for indulging in, but a much kinder explanation to her behaviour, in contrast to the things she had imagined. 

The gaps were filled now, she thought. A disastrous hook-up on Wednesday night, morning drunkenness and lashing out at Miranda yesterday, all events leading up to: waking up today. The loop was complete now. Ignoring her unnervingly suspicious instinct, telling her a piece was missing, she settled for this theory. She gave herself a nod of satisfaction and left the bar shortly after thanking Katie.

Holly felt like pampering herself today. She went to a supermarket and bought some groceries. She needed to cook for herself, to clear her mind. It was therapy for her. And maybe, contemplate the next big move for her career. She needed some time alone. With a large bag of groceries in hand, Holly managed a wry grin at the cashier and walked to her car in the parking lot. She was relieved. Back in control.

Things felt fixed. A minor rough patch, that happens to everyone. Two reckless days, being fired from a job. Nothing unrecoverable, in fact on her way to recovery already. 

Holly cracked open the boot to put the bag of groceries in. It squeaked open to reveal a duffel bag sitting plump on the mat. Confused, she unzipped it.

Money. Bundles and bundles of cash, an ocean of it, contained neatly within a duffel bag in the boot of her car.

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a (at the time) co-worker of mine who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with her boyfriend, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was **wednesday around 3pm**

next day, **thursday at 11am**, she texts the group again, saying: ""hey all, plans changed and i arrived in town earlier. i canceled my class (she's a professor) and will be here from today until sunday x"" man, i swear i felt in my gut she came earlier to try to see me... i didn't even open the message, and decided to cut her off after this

lo and behold, when i'm leaving the building i was working that day, who i see at the stairs? yeah that woman... with her past coordinator and a random girl. i briefly stopped by, greeted everyone, and ran away as if my life depended on it

didn't open the group chat and of course she directly texted me on monday after my silence. she was upset at how weird was bumping into each other at work and how sad she was because she couldn't keep in touch with me and another colleague (both of us didn't reply to the group chat). she asked if everything was all right between us. after thinking about it, i said our fling was toxic as hell and that i'd step back from our connection. but wished her well and hoped she understand

she blamed me for being hot & cold, and wish me well too. then, i blocked her and left the group chat

Hi everyone,

I use ChatGPT quite a lot, and one friction I kept hitting was navigation. Once a conversation gets long, finding an earlier prompt becomes surprisingly tedious. 

To solve this pain point I built a Chrome extension called ChatGPT Prompt Scroller. 

What it does: 

* Adds a sidebar that lists all the prompts in a current chat. 
* Clicking a prompt instantly takes you to that exact spot in the conversation. 

Pricing: It has a 7-day free trial (no card required). If you find it useful, there’s a one-time lifetime license for $20 USD.

Known Issue: If you start a brand new chat, the sidebar may not appear until you refresh once. I’m actively working on a fix, but wanted to get this out early to gather real feedback. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts—does this actually save you time? Anything you’d want added or changed?

On Sunday, December 21, between 2:00–2:30 PM, my snowboard (Burton Ripcord with Mission bindings) was stolen from a rack near the base area while I stepped inside briefly to get coffee.

When I reported it, multiple staff members—including Lost & Found and Ski Patrol—told me that ski and snowboard theft happens often there. That was honestly the most frustrating part. There were no warning signs, no reminders to use locks, and no visible security presence around the racks.

I was also told there’s a camera facing the racks, but staff can’t access it unless a police report is filed, which I’ve since done.

Posting this mainly as a warning to others:  
👉 Use a lock  
👉 Don’t assume the racks are safe  
👉 Be extra careful at the base area

This is a long shot but hey... silver lining, am I right? If you fancy someone whom you can enjoy the silence with and also talk to for hours nonstop, you might find this interesting.

**About me**  
I will tell you my actual name once we hit it off, but right now it's **Jeff** for you. I'm 25 and turning 26 next year (Almost a grandpa). I like Dogs, books, good films, a smoke at the right time and place, and a good dirty chai.

**Why I'm Here**  
I've had a few relationships in the past, and none of them worked out long-term for various reasons. Looking back, there was a sense of performance that I had to partake in to keep the ""idea"" of me alive in their heads. I believe that exhaustion contributed to things ending. After a long while of being just by myself and a lot of intellectualization, I realized that the more unfiltered I am, the more I attract things that actually *stay* with me. This proved true in almost every aspect of my life. So, the answer to the question is: When I lay things about me out in the open like this, it means I don't have to look over my shoulder waiting for some mask to come off. It allows me to just BE.

**The Details**  

* ***Books:*** My two favorite books I've read so far is *The Stranger* and *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.* Currently reading *The Moral Animal* and *Why Buddhism is True*. 
* ***Music:*** My current daily listen is *Heaven* by Blaze. I also make some amazing Spotify playlists but there's nobody to share them with (hence why I'm here). 
* ***Films:*** I have 5 films I will never forget: *Before Sunrise, Filth, The Jacket, Trainspotting 2,* and *Requiem for a Dream*. 
* ***Career:*** I work as a **Video Game Artist** (started off as a designer). I believe I will always find purpose and joy despite whatever I am doing or the circumstances.  

I make an amazing tea for myself almost every morning while watching my dog play in the sun, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. I find happiness in the smallest things: the warmth of the sun on my skin, birds chit-chatting, the cold wind at night, and branches of medium-sized bushes grazing my skin (I promise I'm not crazy).

One of my biggest fears is that I would go on living my life not being witnessed by anyone. I would want them to notice each and every part of me. The good, the bad, and the ugly. the paradoxical traits that makes me, ME. I don't want to wither away like a piece of art hidden in a museum's vault nor be collected by someone who does not admire.

**Extras** (Randoms)

* I'm a huge lord of the rings nerd.
* I like to make things just for the sake of creating something out of nothing.
* I have a pretty cool PC setup.
* As of now I have sold 10 really cool big artworks to my friends and they love it (at least they tell me they do)
* I like getting into the lore and the details of anything, especially in films.
* I really like riding motorcycles.

**Socially**

* I have about 3 extremely close friends whom I would gladly call family; I would kill for them.
* I love to cook for other people and it's something I take a bit of pride in ( I make a killer spaghetti)
* I may not be the most altruistic person, but I try to help anyone that I care about.
* I like doing stupid risky things with my friends that don't always guarantee safety...but you only live once, right? RIGHT????

**Few philosophies** (or one)  
I view life through a mix of absurdism and a primal appreciation for the small things. I don't believe in a grand pre-destined plan, which I find very liberating for me because it means ""meaning"" is found in the immediate moment, whether that's a cup of tea/coffee, the warmth of the sun, or a conversation that lasts until 4 AM and you don't sleep the next day. I believe we spend too much of our lives performing for an invisible audience, letting people fall in love with versions of us that don’t exist. I judge character by authenticity and how you treat people who can do nothing for you. I’d rather be disliked for the raw reality of who I am than loved for a person I am not.

**What I Look Like**  
I would say I'm not on the unattractive side of things.

* **Build:** Lean, Brown Skinned, 70kg (hah, metrics!) and about 5'9"".
* **Features:** Deep-set eyes and high cheekbones... do these even matter?

**The Logistics**

* **You:** Ideally aged **18-26**, healthy, single, and female.
* **Dealbreakers:** Kids.
* **Communication:** I would like for things to come slow. Given the nature of my work, I'm pretty much always online on Discord, WhatsApp, and whatever else.

If any of this resonated with you, whether it’s the love for a life filled absurdity, the hatred of performing, or just the need for a good dirty chai OR SPAGHETTI...shoot me a message ;)

1pwc4od,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/1pwc4od/stripped_of_technical_language_how_simple_is_the/,"Stripped of technical language, how simple is the ‘cure’ for this disorder?","Forgive me if i sound ignorant, or naive, i am only trying to remain hopeful for the year ahead. I had a thought that i would like someone to help me follow through to completion. With disorders such as NPD, BPD, HPD, schizoid PD, Bipolar ect… the path forward in given situations is highly dependent on context. The disorders delude their ability to perceive objective reality, and thus therapy is almost required to help them to be able to distinguish objective and perceived realities, while also helping them build up coping mechanisms during times of distress. 

For AVPD, (specifically self aware avpd) it’s very different. The correct path forward is clear, it’s just disproportionately terrifying. To me, avoidance is like a bruise, and when it feels as though it’s being pressed, and i feel the need to withdraw entirely, then i know that the correct path forward is just to do the scariest possible thing in that situation. Ofcourse, that in itself is the hard part; many factors prevent me from even conceiving of doing the afformentioned thing. Like a physical brick wall, and a million miles and years between myself and the other side of that wall. But still, i KNOW that the right place to be is on the other side of that wall. I know that the right thing to do is to make the bruise hurt more and more until it numbs. My perception of reality is distorted only up to a certain point. All of my problems would be solved if i just did things. If i filled out my day with scary things, and then kept doing that. If i had uncomfortable conversations with people when i know that i should, instead of playing it out in my head whilst holding resentment for them. The path forward is to just follow whichever thought paralyzes you. It’s the only crippling personality disorder that i feel could be ‘brute forced’ into remission.

For example, i saw a post the other day about an extended meditation retreat to help with symptoms, and some of the comments noted how meditation was ‘too uncomfortable’ to do, as it forced them to face themselves, and they didn’t like it. They also discussed how you don’t need to ‘traumatize yourself’ in order to get better. They were not referring to an extended retreat, but to meditation in general: The act of sitting by yourself in silence and breathing. If that cannot be done, then nothing can. No amount of shallow exposure therapy (like saying thank you in coffee shops)  can make up for the fact that you cannot sit with yourself and breathe for 5 minutes. The idea that we should not encourage a given beneficial thing to pw AVPD because some people might find it uncomfortable is ridiculous to me, because surely uncomfortable is the emotion we are aiming for at this stage. Everything we are scared of can be brute forced, albeit with varying levels of strength and time. Becoming an overall more secure person requires several thousand compounded instances of brute force, whilst being unafraid of going to the gym requires anywhere between 2-10 instances of brute force.

Okay, I suppose this also assumes intellectualized artificial confidence: to know objectively that your view of yourself is misguided and extreme, and that you do have a right to be here, despite your intrinsic belief lagging behind your grounded rational truths. Brute force works only if you’ve crossed the line between believing you truly are inferior, and knowing that you objectively aren’t but still cannot act or think outside of the belief. So maybe i’m speaking from a privileged perspective. 

I welcome all criticism of my overly optimistic piece. Please help me understand. I have just been diagnosed and i don’t want to live this way, and i cannot afford therapy. ",17,1766775917.0,AvPD,1,0.96,False

This is a long shot but hey... silver lining, am I right? If you fancy someone whom you can enjoy the silence with and also talk to for hours nonstop, you might find this interesting.

**About me**  
I will tell you my actual name once we hit it off, but right now it's **Jeff** for you. I'm 25 and turning 26 next year (Almost a grandpa). I like Dogs, books, good films, a smoke at the right time and place, and a good dirty chai.

**Why I'm Here**  
I've had a few relationships in the past, and none of them worked out long-term for various reasons. Looking back, there was a sense of performance that I had to partake in to keep the ""idea"" of me alive in their heads. I believe that exhaustion contributed to things ending. After a long while of being just by myself and a lot of intellectualization, I realized that the more unfiltered I am, the more I attract things that actually *stay* with me. This proved true in almost every aspect of my life. So, the answer to the question is: When I lay things about me out in the open like this, it means I don't have to look over my shoulder waiting for some mask to come off. It allows me to just BE.

**The Details**  

* ***Books:*** My two favorite books I've read so far is *The Stranger* and *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.* Currently reading *The Moral Animal* and *Why Buddhism is True*. 
* ***Music:*** My current daily listen is *Heaven* by Blaze. I also make some amazing Spotify playlists but there's nobody to share them with (hence why I'm here). 
* ***Films:*** I have 5 films I will never forget: *Before Sunrise, Filth, The Jacket, Trainspotting 2,* and *Requiem for a Dream*. 
* ***Career:*** I work as a **Video Game Artist** (started off as a designer). I believe I will always find purpose and joy despite whatever I am doing or the circumstances.  

I make an amazing tea for myself almost every morning while watching my dog play in the sun, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. I find happiness in the smallest things: the warmth of the sun on my skin, birds chit-chatting, the cold wind at night, and branches of medium-sized bushes grazing my skin (I promise I'm not crazy).

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Lately it feels like sleep is the only time in my life where nobody needs anything from me. No messages, no “quick question”, no thinking about what I forgot to do or who I disappointed today. When I’m asleep, I’m not a daughter, not a friend, not a worker, not a responcible adult. I’m just… gone for a bit. And I kinda love that. I used to stay up late scrolling for no reason and thought I just had bad habits, but now I realize night was the only time that felt quiet and safe. No expectations at 3:14am. No pressure. Just silence.

What’s funny is that during the day I’m constantly tired, but at night my brain suddenly wants to replay my whole life like a badly edited movie. Random memories, awkward conversations from 8 years ago, things I should have said, things I def didnt need to remember. But even with that, laying in bed still feels calmer than being awake. The lights are off, the world is smaller, sounds are softer. Sometimes I just stare at the ceiling thinking “wow this is the only moment I’m not performing being a human”. Even my thoughts feel slower, like they’re walking instead of sprinting.

I remember in my early 20-s I treated sleep like an enemy. Bragging about running on 4 hours, coffee instead of rest, alarms every 5 minutes. I honestly thought being exhausted meant I was doing life right. Now? I guard my sleep like it’s a secret treasure. I cancel plans, I leave messages unread, I let laundry sit there another day. And yeah, sometimes I feel guilty about it, like I’m being lazy or dramatic. But then I notice how much better I feel when I actually let myself rest. My mood is better, I’m less snappy, my body hurts less.Crazy how that works, right.

Sleep now feels less like “rest” and more like a boundary. A quiet no to the world. I don’t owe explanations when I’m asleep. I don’t have to justify why I’m unavailable. I can just disappear for a few hours and reset. And honestly, in a world where everyone expects you to be reachable all the time, that feels almost rebellious. I’m still bad at routines, still doomscroll sometimes, still overthink at night. But learning to respect my need for sleep feels like learning to be kinder to myself.

**The Quick Mill Pop Up / 3 Kilos in**

TL;DR up front: A great machine with some annoying (because easily preventable) caveats. Right out of the box, the machine looks great. I love the design and form factor.  
Setting it up is very easy, and using the sideways water tank is a treat.  
I love how quickly it heats up and how many functions they packed into it. That, paired with the good build quality, gives you a really compelling machine at the price.  
I think the Profitec Go beats it in build quality and finish, so does the ECM Classika (at a heftier price point), which also offers a lot more functionality, especially if you upgrade it.

Pulling the first shot was very easy to do, and only steaming milk is much more tedious than it would have to be if they only changed the steam wand (again) and the steam knob.

Now, let’s get into it. 

After a really stressful year and having dealt with some bullshit I wish on no one, I decided to treat myself to a new espresso machine.   
So a month ago, after a lot of milling around, and a lot of consideration and trying out different machines in person in different stores, I decided to buy a Quick Mill Pop Up (Lucca Tempo in some parts).

I drink a mix of espresso and cappuccino, sometimes my wife wants a cappuccino too.  
Based on that, I was looking for a machine that would have the following features in descending order of importance:

PID. 

Fast heat up (for a boiler machine).

Good steam power.

A design that I would enjoy looking at every morning.

Option for pre-infusion.

Some way to play around with pressure.

Repairable locally.

Local dealer.

Doesn’t break the bank (but that was more a bonus than a must).

**Based on that, I had a look at the Pop Up at a local store and got it the next day.**

**The pros:** 

1. Looks great. I love that angular chrome design language and the simple UI layout in the front. The lights of the menu and the buttons are really nicely integrated into the whole design.
2. Fast heat up. Like ready in 7 minutes fast. Which is great for boiler machines. 
3. PID. Seems really stable shot to shot. Even when playing around with a new roast for a while, it still seems to be really on point.
4. Easily adjustable overpressure valve that allows for playing with pressure during the shot. 
5. The build quality is great. It’s a super solid machine that won’t have you worrying about anything breaking (maybe except the steam valve/knob). That also goes for the insides. The internal layout is so good, I would feel confident in repairing the machine myself, if no welding was involved.
6. The drip tray is great. It’s very well built and has a small lip that goes into the machine (for the OPV). There’s no sharp corners that feel unpleasant, it doesn’t get hot (hello Rancilio Silvia) and it’s pretty voluminous (hello again Rancilio Silvia). 
7. The sideways water tank is amazing. Not only does it allow for really easy access, it also kind of locks in, thanks to the silicone hoses holding it, without the risk of it falling out when refilling, when you stop at those hoses. It being sideways and see-through also means you always know when you need to refill. 
8. Pulling a shot is a really snappy process with buttons that feel super tactile and react immediately.
9. Doesn’t use a lot of energy. I measured an average of 0.06 kWh from a cold machine to having pulled the first espresso and 0.9 kWh from cold to a 150ml cappuccino.
10. Rather compact. Fits on my counter really well. Doesn’t feel small or too light though. So the form factor is perfect for me.
11. It’s really quiet for a vibration pump machine. Their muffler seems to work very well.

Pulling Espresso is a really pleasant experience that leaves little to be desired. However, there are some cons, most of them having to do with the whole steam assembly. So let’s have a look at those.

**Cons:** 

**First and foremost,** and excuse me if I go on a bit of a rant, but this annoys me to no end\*\*:\*\* Everything about the steam assembly, from the design of the wand and the knob to the height and the awkward placement of the wand in relation to the OPV paddle, SUCKS. SO. MUCH. Especially since all of those things could have been avoided with not much hassle. 

 I fucking hate steaming on this machine. It’s so bad I am almost tempted to sell it again if I can’t mod it (I am pretty sure I can though).  
The newer steam wand is bent a bit backwards instead of forwards, so tilting the pitcher to get a good swirl going is unnecessarily difficult and awkward. It’s also rather short, so you have to be very selective with your pitcher and milk amount, if you don’t want to waste milk.

The over-pressure valve and the steam wand are in each other’s way, so you have to be on either side, and they often catch, and you have to move the wand around the valve paddle.  
And worst of all: The twisting valve/knob is a terrible design. It’s essentially, like most steam handles, a faucet knob, but it’s round and smallish, so it’s hard to get purchase. It’s also unpleasant to use, since there is a groove milled around the whole circumference that kind of pinches your fingers. There’s a reason every faucet lever ever is either, well, a lever, or wavy, like old-school E61 valve handles, or triangular, or it has grooves through in depth, not circumference, to allow for purchase. If your hands get even a little wet while pulling your shot, you are probably going to slip while trying to open or close the steam valve. Why oh why? It’s so unnecessary! Just make it wavy or triangular or something. Seriously, next time you use a faucet, imagine having a small round knob there instead of whatever you have.  
Oh, and I had to fasten it thrice already. It keeps rotating without activating the steam after a couple of weeks.

Moving on:

1. Adjusting the OPV is not flow control. It’s similar, but you can’t just push it back and forth and expect it to react immediately. If you go down too fast, it will trip the OPV (not the solenoid) in a way that it takes a while to get up to pressure again.
2. The shot timer turns off immediately after you stop the shot. So you will often miss how long your shot was if you are preoccupied with something else. That also seems like such an unnecessary negative.
3. The OPV handle is bent in a way that you have to grip it sideways on the Pop Up (not on the Tempo), which feels kind of odd.
4. The finish isn’t quite there. Some of the corners feel and look rough, especially at the meeting of the drip tray and the machine and around the steam handle and the OPV lever. I had to use a screwdriver to align the panels on the left side of the machine. The pressure gauge on the front just looks kind of cheap. Plus the steam handle feels like low-quality wood. I am also not a fan of random wood accents that don’t follow the rest of the design language.
5. The menu is odd. Why is the PID menu situated AFTER the option to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius? How often do they think people adjust that?
6. The pre-infusion works without the machine’s pump and dispenses around 20ml of water. Way too little to saturate almost any puck. The cheaper Quick Mill Pop uses its pump for that. A much better solution.
7. Parts availability. It is unnecessarily hard to find parts. Somehow the Quick Mill homepage is a mess and trying to find out that all regular Quick Mill E61 portafilters and baskets fit took way too long to find out. However, I did buy the bottomless portafilter for Quick Mill E61 and it is amazing. Super well built and it looks gorgeous. For anyone wondering. The portafilters with the ears at 9 and 6 seem to be good generally. My Rancilio filters all fit too.
8. Weak solenoid valve. Even perfect pucks often come out muddy. 

**What I learned after using it extensively over the past month.**

  1.  Keep an eye on the shot timer or you will miss it.

1. Tilt the steam wand sideways and then forward to get a good swirl.
2. I am way more irked by small inconveniences than I thought when I pay a lot of money fr something.   
3. A shower screen and spring will keep the puck dry.
4. I rarely touch temperature.
5. I need reliable pre-infusion at least like the one on the E61 on a day-to-day basis. Not pressure profiling.

**How it compares to other single boilers I own:**

ECM Classika: the Pop Up has faster heat up and the water tank is much nicer. In any other regard, the Classika is a lot better. Better built, much more functionality, better steaming and better boiler. The drip tray is kind of a wash, but the Pop Up might eek that one out actually.

Rancilio Silvia (V5): The Pop Up is better in almost every regard. More functionality, especially with the PID and pressure valve. The drip tray is leagues better.  
The Silvia has much better steaming and the build quality is a lot more sturdy. Like a LOT. But that's what the Silvia is famous for, isn't it?

I also looked at and decided against: 

**Olympia Cremina:** Too expensive for what it is. You have to hold onto it to not tip it over when pulling higher-pressure shots. It gets really hot, so holding onto it is unpleasant, even when putting a towel on the machine. Does make really nice espresso though.

**Profitec Go:** Really nice machine. Looks great, fast heat-up, pressure easily adjustable, good steam. Almost got that one, but the Quick Mill beat it out because of some more functionality and the Profitec was a bit more expensive here and only available in a color I didn’t like.

**La Marzocco Linea Micra:** Absolutely gorgeous, incredibly well built, incredible heat-up, and great steam. I decided against it because I just hate that you kind of need an app if you want to be more involved and it doesn’t allow you to adjust a couple of its functions in body. It doesn’t even have a shot timer. I hate that so much that it was over the top there, even though it looks just so nice.

**A host of different ECM machines:** I already have one and wanted something different than another E61. I almost got the ECM Puristika though, just because of how well designed and built it was. Seriously, you kind of have to see it in person to appreciate just how nice it is. I am still considering getting it, just because it’s so amazing in person.

**Profitec Move:** Really nice, high-quality machine that ticks every box. I just absolutely loathe the design. It looks like an appliance found in any southern German bakery that also serves cake and coffee. Seeing it in the flesh, I could not get around that and I hate myself for it, but that’s how it is.

 

I did a bit of a write-up here because you find so little on this machine online and I hope it will help some people when looking it up. Hope you liked it.

1pwbtrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1pwbtrq/have_faith_youll_get_through/,have faith -- you'll get through,"I am writing this thirteen nearing fourteen weeks post discard. I got a little lucky because it was a short relationship (almost three months), but I was devastated in the aftermath. He really, seriously hurt me and I felt achey and depressed over him for way longer than I felt was normal for such a short relationship. It is the nature of it -- a ""discard"" completely wrecks your nervous system. This isn't a ""normal"" breakup and I experienced something completely different from anything I've ever been through in previous breakups. 

  
But, now, it is getting better. I realized the other day that I hadn't thought of him in a couple of days -- a first through this journey of moving on. I stopped rereading my last letter to him a couple weeks ago. I haven't had the urge to unblock him to stalk a little -- I haven't had weak moments where something like that would even be interesting to me. 

I woke up this morning and didn't think of him at all. I made coffee and read poetry and listened to music and thought about my garden and ceramics and work. The only time I think of him is when I open reddit -- which is rarer now that I don't feel much of an urge to find solace in this discard anymore. 

Here are my tips, generic as ever, but what worked for me: 

1. **seriously, seriously cut them off -- disappear from their life, their access.** I wrote my ex an angry letter during the discard where I very plainly told him that I wouldn't be his friend (what he explicity wanted in our breakup) and that I specifically wanted him to turn around and avoid me if he ever saw me in our city because I hated his guts. I was so angry in my letter (angrier than I actually was) that I am absolutely certain he won't dare to reach out. This is what you want -- you do not want them to think they can access you anymore. **They're not entitled to have you on their terms. I definitely regreted this hard boundary in moments where I wished he'd reach out, but, trust, it is infinitely better to have them avoid you than to have them orbit you.** 

2. **block them**, block their friends, block their band and also stop going to the bar they hang out at. Unless their friends are your friends -- in which case you should stay friends with them, but, for me, his friends were HIS friends, so I had no qualms about drawing a line in the sand. Their friends will understand, hopefully, that you won't want any reminders of your ex. 

3. **Write as many angry letters as you want, tell yourself that you'll send them on X date, and then never do.** I got out all my anger and questions and sadness over the course of a dozen word documents -- and I said that I'd send him a letter around now, and yet I won't. This has been a good way of processing for me. 

4. **When you've gotten to the point where you feel open to meeting new people, go ahead.** I felt for a while after the discard that he was perfect for me and it would be impossible to have that soft, lovely connection with another person -- which was proven false. I met many men who I found funny and interesting and attractive -- just go on those first dates. You don't need to have a new relationship or sleep with anyone -- just meet people and be reminded that there are many fascinating people out there who will find you just as fascinating. I think it is important to take new connections slow, too, in this time -- **be open, be cautious.**

5. It is silly and generic, but **do what you need to do to feel like you're evolving past the breakup.** Self-improvement type stuff. I personally took the plunge and got braces (something I had always wanted to do) and got deeply involved in my ceramics and started painting stars and flowers on my walls. I now feel a bit like a different form of myself from who I was with him -- and I like that, because I am myself. Do not try to change yourself to be better suited for them -- like, for example, I considered in the breakup attempting to become more his ""type"" and get a tattoo and dye my hair and work myself out to be curvier and edgier, but that isn't me. I am soft and scrawny and I was not put on this earth to be his ideal woman. I was cool and sexy before him and I'll be cooler and sexier after him, because that is just me.  

My experience is probably more oriented towards women, but I hope that anyone regardless of their gender or orientation can get something from my experience. <3 sending you all love and prosperity into this new year!!",6,1766775192.0,AvoidantBreakUps,3,1.0,False

As far as keeping my house upright, it's been up and down. I think some of my biggest problems are time management (especially when waking up on a work day), buying too much furniture & stuff, and trying not to let half my fridge waste away. I think I'm also getting used to the fact that my apartment's laundromat closes at or around 11pm, which is tough, but that's the rules unless I do better.

Design-wise, I've got work to do. I [need a coffee table](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1otdyap/) in my living room, I need to find a place to keep my mail, I gotta organize three boxes of assorted items, and I probably need to go through my closet and make sure I got it sorted out too.

On the personal and social side, I'm really concerned for myself. It wasn't a good year for me. I broke up with my now second ex-girlfriend, but it honestly wasn't as good a fit as I had hoped a year ago when we got together. Ever since, I've done very little for myself to make it better. While I've had my share of social outings to find a way to grow a social circle here, I've grown increasingly inconsistent in communication and socializing with potential new friends. I've become more and more anti-social...finding myself having plans to go out somewhere and then turning around and staying home because my place is a mess or other excuses. And probably the most hurtful is that I went the entire year without going on a first date post-breakup. It hurts because I can't start a relationship without getting far enough to spend time on that level. This combined with some setbacks such as a seizure a month ago and an accident that left me without a car most of the summer really left me distraught. Whatever I do in 2026, I need to do better in that department if I want to thrive despite coming home every day as a single man living alone.

Despite the challenges, again, I'm still thankful that I get to do this. I've been starving to get away from family since college. And though times have fallen hard lately, I hope and want to find the optimism so that next year, the look back is much more positive and joyful!

And yet, there’s a very specific kind of emptiness that job doesn’t fill. The absence of someone to come home to and have deep conversation. I miss the simple intimacy of checking in: “How was your day, really?” The kind of coffee talk that starts with small updates and ends somewhere deeper. Hopes, fears, silly stories, and the comfort of being understood without having to perform.

You obviously do not understand shit about quality control! it’s making assumptions based in statistical test for features rankend by their individual risk. 
Made up example of a coffee machine: a batch of 1000 machines got produced. You test the pressure valve of 128 machine to make sure it does not fucking explode while using it, but only 2 machines whether the drip tray was cut within their specifications. Because it’s less of a risk/more acceptable if there are 5% or more of machines with a drip tray that does not perfectly fit (might make an annoying sound during brewing but what ever it’s not safety related). AND IF there is usually post market surveillance, means if a lot of people complain about drip trays there will be investigations about the root cause and process improvements etc. thinks a subject to change, always! Machines age, input material quality changes too. Maybe you have a new supplier for your aluminum which is not as pure as the old. Something you might not know at the time of the change because one can’t test anything!

I was so excited to surprise my wife with these, and I figured I’d give an update with how things went for Christmas. Here’s what I sent to my friend, who’s not an ACNH player: (Names changed to “My wife” and “My daughter”)

——-

*So, my wife was very much surprised and appreciative of the “fossils” you made.* 

*The game has a thing where you’ll hear the wind, and if you look up, many times there is a balloon flying overhead. You pop the balloon, the present falls, and you open it to find whatever. Then, there’s four fossils on your island every day. While you don’t normally find fossils in a floating present, I filled them up, put them in a box, decorated it like one of the floating presents, and tied a balloon to it.* 

*You use a slingshot to shoot them down, and I saw that Walmart had similar slingshots in the store for like $7, so I* ***HAD*** *to get one. I go on YouTube and find a video that just has the wind sound, and I get my daughter in on things. I’d left the slingshot on the coffee table before my wife woke up, so yesterday, when it came time for stockings, I excused myself from the room and gave my daughter a “Okay, ready?” wink.* 

*My wife is on the couch, and she starts hearing the wind from a speaker in the great room. “What’s going on?’ “Mom, you should grab that slingshot and pop the balloon!” Out I come with the “floating” package, and my wife is just laughing and smiling at it all. She then opened it up and found chocolates in the little fossils, and chap sticks in the bigger one.* 

*All and all, for at least my wife, daughter and myself - which is to say, those flat on fully addicted to Animal Crossing - it worked out very, very well, and I can’t thank you enough for your part in that.*

i'd love some feedback from you all

long story short: i got involved with a (at the time) co-worker of mine who's in a long distance relationship. she's bored with her boyfriend, wanted to open her relationship to date me, but we ended up fooling around a couple of times before that. things got messy, with a lot of back and forth especially from me, and we stepped back from the sexual/romantic fling

we kept things friendly since we were part of the same group of colleagues/friends, but she'd always hint at something romantic when i was moving on

she finally got a job in another city, so i quietly moved on and left her behind until a few weeks ago. she texted our group chat asking for our thanksgiving plans bc she'd visit out town. i already had something, so said so. then, she announced she'd be here two weeks prior to that - and i scheduled a trip to another state to avoid bumping into her. i liked the message in the chat and didn't say anything

fast forward to the week of her visit. she directly texts me, saying to ""let her know if i would like to meet for coffee or just hangout with our friends."" i told her i wouldn't be around in the weekend, but wished her lots of fun and next time i'd join. this was **wednesday around 3pm**

next day, **thursday at 11am**, she texts the group again, saying: ""hey all, plans changed and i arrived in town earlier. i canceled my class (she's a professor) and will be here from today until sunday x"" man, i swear i felt in my gut she came earlier to try to see me... i didn't even open the message, and decided to cut her off after this

lo and behold, when i'm leaving the building i was working that day, who i see at the stairs? yeah that woman... with her past coordinator and a random girl. i briefly stopped by, greeted everyone, and ran away as if my life depended on it

didn't open the group chat and of course she directly texted me on monday after my silence. she was upset at how weird was bumping into each other at work and how sad she was because she couldn't keep in touch with me and another colleague (both of us didn't reply to the group chat). she asked if everything was all right between us. after thinking about it, i said our fling was toxic as hell and that i'd step back from our connection. but wished her well and hoped she understand

she blamed me for being hot & cold, and wish me well too. then, i blocked her and left the group chat

I have kind of made a hotel date with a guy I met for Sunday and it's only just hitting me now, I don't really know how to do anything lol

Sorry for the long read but I need to get all this out in the open, I'm 40 and until very recently lived a totally straight life.  Always been curious, had some fantasies over guys before, but largely ignored it and felt into girls.  About a month ago I go into a coffee shop on the city and as soon as I get to the counter I'm greeted by this amazing looking young guy.  The way our eyes met and his smile stopped me in my tracks.  He takes my order and holds eye contact with me.  I'm thinking ""I think I am in here????"".  Anyway I go have my coffee and before I leave he comes over and asks me how are things.  I couldn't believe I was doing this but I decided to flirt, I say that the coffee shop is really smart having him as the first thing people see when they walk in.  We go back and forth, crazy intense eye contact the entire time.  I ask if if he wants a coffee on his break, he says he actually finishes his shift in 15 minutes and we can go have a chat.  So I finish up and head outside.  My heart is thumping waiting for him, I could not believe I was doing this.  Eventually he comes out and gives me the biggest smile.  I just blurt out ""this is very new for me"", he laughs and says he can tell and not to worry he's not going to jump on me.  I'm literally just gazing at him.  Before I knew it, in a total blur, we are making out right there on the street.  It felt incredible, but I just felt shocked I was doing that.  Yada yada yada he gives me his number and we part.  I didn't message him for about 5 days as I needed to process how I was feeling.  Eventually I give in and message.  We message for a bit and then arrange to meet up for a coffee date.  So I met him a couple of weeks ago and I had by far the best date of my entire life.  It felt so natural and comfortable.  We greeted eachother with a full on kiss and after about 2 minutes walking I just reached out and started holding his hand.  We had breakfast and went for a walk holding hands the entire time and eventually sat on a bench by the river and made out for about an hour lol.  I absolutely loved spending time with him and I'm so attracted to him, I just think he's beautiful.  

I haven't been able to meet due to work and trips since then, but we have just set up to meet this coming Sunday and it's going to be at a hotel.  So obviously sex is going to happen.  I'm terrified, but really want it with him.  He's totally cool with going at my pace and what I'm comfortable with.  I'm scared of my lack of experience turning this into a disappointment for him.  So some advice on showing him a great time would be much appreciated!

I'm cut, but I don't think he is.  Therefore I don't even know my way around his cock lol.  Any suggestions on giving really good head?  I love eating girls ass so I'm definitely going to do that to him.  I brought a douche kit and I'm going to go ""fully prepped and ready"" if the energy takes us in that direction.  

Weirdest part of this for me is how OK I am with it?  Like I'm perfectly comfortable with myself.  I don't feel wrong, I'm not hating on myself.  It does feel crazy and still have processing to do.  But right now I just can't wait to be in bed with this stunning guy lol

I struggled with addiction (alcohol) for years & our fights would get physical & out of control, Ive been to jail & got my head open, got a few stitches, because of our fights, I had zero control & he knew what buttons to push. I did 6 months of rehab & been sober for almost 2 years, I got pregnant without even thinking it was possible, but being sober seemed like help with my fertility , we accepted we weren’t going to have kids but baby was always wanted since I found out about my pregnancy & now that I’m sober, have a clear mind & most importantly I’m a mother to a beautiful baby boy that I love! I changed so much in a positive way & I  started to realize how toxic our relationship has been all these years & how the same patterns have been repeating in situations like this. So this just happened, He ruined baby’s first Christmas & I’m deeply hurt about it, How it happened; we got invited to a Christmas gathering that he didn’t want to attend, we basically needed a ride to go, he drives us & you can tell he is mad, he stays in the car for hours, people go offer him food & try to convince him to come & nothing, throwing a fit like a god damn child, 5 hours go by & he is done, he comes to the gate & starts screaming that  we have to go, In front of everyone, my dad saw how rude he was acting & didn’t want to expose the baby & me in that car with a person acting like that or us arguing In front of the baby, , so I got a ride with my dad, this pissed him off that he came for nothing, what does he do? He disrespected my family & almost made my dad loose his temper, made a big as scene screaming that we lied to him, so embarrassing & doing all this sober, first xmas ruined. Next day comes, he wakes up like nothing happened! Gets a coffee & sits in his computer to play video games, so I confronted him about it, told him to at least apologize to my dad, that what he did was wrong, he then stands up from his chair & tries to just leave without taking any responsibility or accountability for his actions, he hops in his car & without a care in the world he leaves all the responsibility to myself. He didn’t even look at the baby, he didn’t even try to do anything to fix the situation but made it worse & started blaming it on me, he then said “I hope it was worth satisfying your new family”  & bounced, he also left me & baby alone to go sleep for 2 days when we first came home from hospital & needed him the most. When I was a drunk I used to beg him to stay, or I’ll be calling his phone denigrating myself, well not anymore & seems like this really hurts him & pisses him off, that he starts to act this crazy, playing the victim! before it was ok to walk away we didn’t have a baby, I was a drunk whatever, but now that Theres is a child involved & u want to act the same, I’m tired of it. This time is definitely different I don’t even want him back anymore, he takes out the worst version of myself & I don’t want to expose the baby to this toxic environment, I don’t drink anymore & he still manages to push my buttons & make me act like before, he is not going to change & it just sucks to accept this, that I’ll have to raise my child without a dad. Not that is wrong or I can’t by myself but it sucks, I come from a divorced family & know how much it sucks. Now if he decides to apologize I feel like is too late for any fixing, & for what? To repeat this again? Do I put a fake smile & raise my baby with a child? Or do I take full responsibility & erase him for our lives? Im still recovering from giving birth going thru postpartum & so many physical & emotional changes & all he can think is  to leave us. ",5,1766774434.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

19 F here. I need to rant because this has been sitting in my head for months and I am tired of carrying it quietly.

A few months ago, I was traveling by metro when a guy struck up a conversation. It felt normal and easy. We realised our colleges are nearby, talked for a bit, and he asked for my number. I did not overthink it. We started talking regularly and he asked me out. First date was coffee. Second was Chowpatty, just walking and talking by the sea. Third was go karting and then long conversations after. Nothing dramatic. Just two people getting to know each other.

I was nervous the entire time because I had never dated before. This would have been my first relationship if it became official. I do not do situationships and I do not entertain people for timepass. If I show up, it is because I mean it. On the third date, there was a moment where he leaned in really close. I thought he was going to kiss me. Then he stopped, pulled back, and said we should meet again sometime. I went home confused but still hopeful, thinking maybe he wanted to take things slow.

The very next day, he sent a text calling it off. He said we are not a good match and we should not see each other anymore. No conversation, no explanation. Just that. I replied calmly and asked for clarity. I even called a few times. He did not respond. He ghosted me completely.

A few days later, I saw him near his college, which is close to mine. I waved and said hi. He saw me clearly, gave a kind of annoyed, almost angry look, and then ignored me and walked away like I did not exist. That moment hurt more than the text.

What I do not understand is the logic. If this is what he wanted, why not after the first date. Why go till three. Why plan things, say meet again, get that close, if he had already decided he was done. I know no one owes me a relationship. I know people can change their minds. But basic respect would have been nice.

And honestly, I keep thinking bhagwaan kis janam ka badla le rahe hain mujhse. Main genuinely sabse achha behave karti hoon. Unnecessarily rude nahi hoti. Studies pe focus karti hoon, apna kaam karti hoon. Phir ye dardnaak haadse mere saath hi kyun hote hain. Jab koi khud aata hai aur phir aise chala jaata hai jaise kuch tha hi nahi.

Maybe this should not hurt as much as it does. It was only a few dates. But when you are 19 and it would have been your first relationship, it stays with you. Not because you lost him, but because you lost the belief that something simple and normal could happen without becoming confusing or hurtful.

That is it. Just a rant. I will move on. I just needed to say it somewhere instead of pretending I am unaffected all the time.

Hope you are having a nice holiday season! 

I'm thinking about a surf trip in French polynesia and was wondering the cost of it.

  
For those who went there recently, how much did it cost you on average for: 

\- One night in a surf house/shared bedroom

\- One meal/coffee/drink

\- Transportation between surf spots (not talking about international flights)

\- One day rental for a surf board

  
For a 4 weeks trip, I'm budgeting all of this at €5k (approx $5.9k) without the plane tickets. Do you think I'm delulu?

  
Thanks a lot!

Washington’s last 7 straight home games have seen more than 225 points, and while I know Toronto hasn’t exactly been crushing points lately, the Wizards’ defense leaves plenty to be desired.

1pwb5ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1pwb5ig/how_to_work_4_hours_a_day_and_still_achieve_more/,How to Work 4 Hours a Day and Still Achieve More: The SCIENCE Based Productivity Framework Nobody Talks About,"For years, I thought being busy meant being productive. I'd grind 12-hour days, respond to every notification, and attend every meeting. Then I'd collapse at night, wondering why I accomplished nothing meaningful. Sound familiar?

Most productivity advice is garbage. It's either toxic hustle culture that glorifies burnout, or lazy life hack  BS that oversimplifies everything. The truth is somewhere uncomfortable in between. After diving deep into research from Cal Newport's work on deep work, Alex Hormozi's content on focus, and studying how top performers actually structure their days, I realized we've been doing this completely wrong.

The 4-hour workday isn't about working less. It's about working differently. It's about understanding that your brain literally cannot sustain high-level cognitive work for 8+ hours. Biology doesn't care about your deadlines.

Deep work is the cheat code. Cal Newport's book  *Deep Work* will genuinely change how you view productivity. The guy's a computer science professor at Georgetown who's published multiple books and runs a successful podcast, yet he's done by 5:30 pm daily and never works weekends. The book breaks down why our addiction to shallow work, constant communication, and endless meetings is destroying our ability to do anything meaningful. Newport defines deep work as professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. This type of work creates new value and is hard to replicate. Most people spend their entire careers never entering this state.

**Here is what actually works**. Protect your morning like your life depends on it. Your prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for complex thinking, is freshest within the first few hours after waking. This is when you should tackle your most cognitively demanding work. Not emails. Not meetings. Real work that moves the needle. I'm talking writing, coding, designing, strategizing, whatever requires genuine thought in your field.

Time blocking is non-negotiable. Block out 2 to 4-hour chunks where you are completely unreachable. Phone on airplane mode. Slack closed. Door shut. Tell people you're in deep work and will respond later. Most urgent things can wait 3 hours. The ones that truly can't are rarer than you think. During these blocks, work on one thing only. Task switching obliterates productivity. Your brain needs roughly 23 minutes to fully re-engage after an interruption, according to research from UC Irvine.

The app Freedom is genuinely life-changing for blocking distracting websites and apps during focus sessions. You can schedule recurring block sessions so you don't even have to think about it. Costs like $40 yearly but saves you hundreds of hours of mindless scrolling. Another good one is Forest, which gamifies staying focused by growing a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Sounds silly, but the visual feedback is surprisingly effective.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around your specific goals. Built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads, it's designed for people who want structured growth without dedicating extra hours to reading. You tell it what skills you're working on or what kind of person you want to become, and it generates custom podcasts at whatever depth you need, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on how you interact with the content, and you can pause anytime to ask questions or explore tangents. It's been useful for turning commute time and gym sessions into actual learning instead of doomscrolling. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous improvement without adding more screen time to your day.

Energy management beats time management. You can't deep work for 4 hours straight on 5 hours of sleep while running on coffee and stress. The research is brutal here. Matthew Walker's  *Why We Sleep* should be mandatory reading. Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired; it literally impairs cognitive function equivalent to being drunk. You're making worse decisions, solving problems more slowly, and retaining information poorly. Most high performers are religious about 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep.

Batch your shallow work ruthlessly. All those emails, messages, and administrative tasks are necessary, but they're not what you're paid to think about. Dedicate specific time blocks, maybe 1 hour after your deep work session, to blast through all of it at once. Trying to sprinkle it throughout the day fragments your attention and kills momentum.

Here is the part people hate hearing. Most meetings are productivity theater. They exist to make people feel busy and important. Before accepting any meeting, ask what decisions need to be made or what specific outcomes are expected. If there's no clear answer, it's probably a waste. Many meetings could be an email. Many emails could be a quick Slack message. Many Slack messages could be nothing at all.

The Pomodoro Technique helps if you struggle with sustained focus initially. Work for 25 minutes, break for 5. After 4 cycles, take a longer 15 to 30-minute break. It trains your focus muscle gradually. The timer creates urgency that combats Parkinson's Law: work expands to fill the time available. When you only have 25 minutes, you stop fucking around.

Protect your attention like it's your most valuable asset, because it is. Every notification, every pop-up, every person interrupting, they're all stealing your capacity to do meaningful work. Your attention is finite, and once it's fragmented, it's incredibly hard to reassemble. Companies spend billions trying to capture your attention. Don't give it away for free.

The 4-hour workday is not lazy. It's strategic. It's recognizing that knowledge work rewards output quality, not input hours. You can either spend 10 hours being busy or 4 hours being effective. The market doesn't care how long you worked. It cares what you produced. This shift in thinking, from hours logged to value created, is what separates people who burn out from people who build sustainable success.",1,1766773533.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

Long story short.

I met a girl through friends, she’s at every family party I go to. She made it seem like she liked me with flirting and wanting to hang out but opened up she wasn’t ready for a relationship but wanted to continue talking as friends. She would still call me everyday and face time at night. 

We hung out this morning for a quick coffee and I told her I couldn’t continue talking everyday because I can’t be friends with someone I like and before things get awkward end it now so I can move on and gave a little speech. 

Instead of saying something about what I said she switched the whole conversation to something about her job. I just got out of the car and left. 

I felt stupid afterwards, after pouring everything out to her. I feel like calling her and saying something but I know there’s no point because that’s my answer there that she doesn’t care. But it’s super frustrating ",1,1766773469.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1pwb4lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pwb4lg/aitah_for_not_putting_up_with_a_friends_crap_even/,AITAH for not putting up with a friend’s crap even though they’re chronically ill.,"This has to do with someone who has been my friend for well over 30 years. She has been chronically ill her entire life with congenital heart defects. She had a transplant ten years ago. However, she now has lung issues due to her congenital defects. She’s had two strokes in her lifetime as well - one at 6 and one in her late 20’s. As we have aged, the effects of the stroke have gotten worse. She cannot be left alone and stays with a friend who lives nearer to her while her husband works. And, she says whatever she wants to ALL of the time.

My husband and I moved 1700 miles to help out. But, we get here and really can’t help much. She and her husband live in a 30 year old motor home that I don’t think runs anymore, and it is absolute squalor. She’s not able to clean it and her husband doesn’t really have the time. I would offer to help clean but it is beyond gross. They live an hour from us and he commutes to his job. We chose to move where there were jobs. They say that they don’t want to pay to live closer and, while I understand it… The amount of money they have to spend for gas and her Ubers to get to doctor’s appointments has to make up for it.

She has come and stayed with me a few times when I have time off from work and I take her to appointments and things. However, here is my problem: she criticizes EVERYTHING. It is a constant barrage of how bougie I am because of where I live (it’s just a normal apartment, for now), the kind of deodorant/moisturizer/dish detergent/body wash I buy… I wash my clothes too much…. I clean too much… I use bougie detergent when I wash… The brand of coffee that I buy isn’t as nice as what they buy… Probably because they are more comfortable than we are (yes, it can turn that quick).

She is so critical of any church that we have visited, because it’s not her church, that I have kept where we’re attending a complete secret because she’d really blow a gasket. Oh yeah, my Bible version is wrong, too. I’ve dealt with narcissistic and spiritual abuse and this about sent me off the deep end.

She criticizes how much my husband works. She speculates that he might be cheating on me (he’s a truck driver and doesn’t work a 9-5). She actually went so far as to tell him, in front of me, that I was feeling unloved and rejected by him. I had NEVER said this to her, nor did I feel this way.

She doesn’t shower. She attributes this to not being able to shower when she got her transplant 10 years ago.

She wasn’t always like this. And, when I try to talk to her about what she does, it becomes tearful excuses about being sick. Or, this was how she was raised, etc…

We both have narcissistic fathers and she has a narcissistic mother. Both of us are no contact with our toxic parents. I’ve done counseling and go to a 12-step group. I’m working on healing. She is just constantly ruminating on the toxic parents. I moved 1700 miles from the crap and have worked on forgiveness. I don’t want to live there mentally or physically.

I have recommended counseling. She did go to a couple of sessions, but stopped, saying that she didn’t want to deal with her stuff because it was too much. And, I understand but she’s destroying herself.

She also tends to be very narcissistic herself. She is always talking about what she does. And, she has to be the smartest person in the room, always. She will interrupt; give some religious platitude; tell you about what her church has done or she does at church. And, that stuff is great, we just don’t need to hear about it 30,000 times. I realize that, because of her health limitations, there’s not a lot she can do. I also know that, if she wants to do something, she will do everything in her power to do it.

All of this has made me want to back off as a friend. I hate it, but all of this stuff has mentally drained me. AITAH for wanting to give this friendship to kabash when I’m not sure that she can help a lot of her bad behavior?",2,1766773466.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False
1pwb4kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1pwb4kz/text_2025_foodie_trends/,[Text] 2025 Foodie Trends,"I run a food and drink experience company (Avital Experiences) so am constantly looking for fun foodie trends for our events. Here are the top trends I saw in 2025, plus my predictions for 2026. 

**Croissant Craziness** \- Croissants became the canvas of the year. Oversized, hybridized, stuffed, stacked, and reimagined, the croissant trend continues to prove that people crave familiarity but are pushed into new formats. 

**Jello Shots & Cakes** \- Jello made a return this year, but all grown-up. In 2025, gelatin became architectural, playful, and downright beautiful. This trend taps into nostalgia while elevating it for adult audiences through form and, of course, alcohol.

**Mini Portions & Pairings** \- Smaller bites ruled 2025. Not out of restraint, but intention (and maybe a touch of inflation). Mini portions, like spoonful desserts, allow eaters to try more, pair thoughtfully, and experience food in a different way. 

**Potato Chip Nachos & Crisp Plates** \- Move over tortilla chips, 2025 was the year of the potato. From charcuterie nachos to the Euro #crispplate, potato chips were topped with serrano ham, corn, mayo, steak, sardines, and so much more.

**McDonald’s Soft Serve Tupperware Dump** \- Why eat one soft serve cone when you can eat six topped with cookies, hot fudge, sprinkles, and caviar?? This trend gets its virality from the “wait, what the heck is going on here” we’re all asking ourselves for the first half of the video. 

**Dubai Chocolate** \- This year Dubai chocolate continued to reign supreme. From candy bars and drinks to brand fusions and dessert, we saw this flavor combination everywhere! Dubai-style pistachio chocolate dominated feeds, signaling a broader shift toward globally inspired luxury sweets.

**Savory Goes Sweet** \- Instead of desserts going savory, 2025 flipped the script. We saw so many traditionally savory foods getting a sweet makeover, like ice cream burgers and sweet pasta. 

**Parmesan With Ice Cream** \- Adding salt to sweet isn’t new, but 2025 was the year of parm on ice cream. Salty, umami-rich cheese paired with cold sweet cream. We are here for it. 

**Quirky Veggie Arrangements** \- The vegetable plate got a glow-up in 2025. No longer sad carrot sticks served with a bowl of ranch, they became centerpieces. Veggies arranged with intention, artistry, and sometimes even humor. 

**Piping Bag Snacks** \- Bayw0lf, the self-proclaimed traveling snackaholic, loves piping bags. And she’s found a way to eat almost everything from them! From mashed potatoes and deviled eggs to hummus and bundt cake, we’re starting to wonder what can’t be eaten from a piping bag? 

**Beautiful Butter** \- For as long as we can remember, butter has had a seat at the table with chefs, recipe developers, and food influencers. And let’s not forget the viral butter boards and butter candles. But this year butter got beautiful. Radish Butter Terrines were the “it” appetizer and butter became the new ice sculpture in 2025. 

**Fun & Unique Food Bars** \- From french fries and butter to marshmallows and cheesecake, it seems like there was a bar for everything in 2025. These bars provide structure to eating out, but enough freedom to customize to make it feel unique to you. We expect to see a lot more of these in 2026. 

**Taco Variations** \- Tacos proved once again that format is king. Sweet, Indian-inspired, dessert-forward—the humble taco became a vessel for creativity across cuisines in 2025.

**Vanilla Ice Cream & Red Wine** \- Affogato, but swap the coffee for red wine. The cold cream softens the wine’s tannins for a rich, balanced flavor. Fun, approachable luxury. 

**Tiramisu Unhinged -** This year, a classic dessert turned into a full-blown spectacle. Tiramisu gingerbread houses,  tiramisu bars. And even tiramisu served in cars, wheelbarrows, and wildly oversized vessels. The point wasn’t elegance. It was abundance.

# 2026 Food Trend Predictions

**More Interactive, Fewer Plates** \- Food will continue moving off plates and into hands. Expect more stations, carts, build-your-own, and finish-at-the-table concepts. People don’t just want to eat. They want to participate.

**Luxury Made Casual** \- Luxury isn’t disappearing. It’s relaxing. High-end ingredients in low-pressure formats. Think caviar bars without white tablecloths, truffles on fries, champagne at walk-up counters.

**Supersized Everything** \- Food is going to get even bigger. With inflation still top of mind, people want food that feels like value. Oversized croissants, giant desserts, shareable portions that make you pause. Big food feels generous. And generosity feels good.

**Edible Vessels** \- More food will come inside other food. Stuffed, filled, wrapped, and poured into. The vessel will become part of the experience. It’s efficient. But more importantly, it’s fun.

**Flavor Perception Play** \- In 2026, food starts messing with your brain even more. But in a great, delicious way. Ice cream shaped like steak and dessert that looks like fried chicken. Savory dishes pretending to be sweets, and vice versa. Is it sweet? Is it savory? You don’t know until you bite. That’s the magic.

1pwb1p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANTM/comments/1pwb1p5/my_thoughts_on_every_contestant_cycle_18/,My thoughts on every contestant (CYCLE #18),"Intro: After a brief Christmas pause I am ready to continue with British Invasion! I hope you all got some gifts😊 and are in a good mood for this discussion! So, USA vs UK:

1. In order to comment on Jasmia, I had to revisit her photos taken on BNTM first. I haven’t watched her season but the first impression I got she seemed much more vivid and joyful. I cannot say her pictures were incredible though, but they were definitely better than on cycle 18. Do I agree with her elimination? I guess so. She didn’t come across as someone I’d be interested in keeping longer.
2. Mariah always reminded me Britney Spears, but luckily, just to some extent. I was very surprised when she got eliminated though, since a handful of girls did worse that week. I agree that she was too sexy in pose but her strong cold-blooded face has evened the triple X in my opinion. Hell, even Kyle was worse – she was just so basic whereas Mariah’s energy fit perfectly into the set.  I’ll come to Kyle soon, but Mariah…. Should have stayed at least one week longer.
3. Speaking of Louise – this cycle has probably the messiest call-out order of all cycles. She did phenomenal, maybe just not a “plus-size” we normally want to see (rather somewhere in the middle). Considering the early stage of competition, she was literally a pro, and I still cannot believe that she left so early. Both pre-makeover and after makeover her presence was so striking and it’s very sad that Cutrone incident completely broke her. Kelly was a total snob sometimes I agree, I just wish Louise handled it better. But I still respect her for taking such decision.
4. Theoretically I could see Candace going far, but realistically she was just so weak, probably worse than Mariah that left second. It’s just something about her presence… She got all the goods, what a face, what a body, but the energy is so blah. I barely remember something besides her good performance with Kardashians and being so bossy to those topless guys. Literally nothing else. Ah yes, BUY THAT COFFEE. JUST BUY IT.
5. I think my love to Ashley is everlasting because I liked her so much in her original BNTM cycle. She was such an interesting contestant there, but for some reason this time she just deflated rapidly. I love how well she portrayed a child and her photo with old cars in haute couture was just magnetic. Nevertheless, this time production looked for something different, and I guess Ashley was a bit too “lovely” for their taste, though personality-wise she was more memorable than half of the cast, since she could be easily both villain and a sweetheart (and that’s why I liked her so much in BNTM!). At this stage I’d eliminate Alisha instead.
6. It feels pretty ridiculous commenting on AzMarie so early simply because she was the first candidate for overseas in my opinion. I am not going to comment on her fabulous photos (we all know how dope they were), but I will say something about her attitude. Normally girls that are taking such bold initiative get immediately praised by judges, but I guess not in her case. I mean she did got praised, but her “image” seemed too rigid for this competition and at some point she started lacking variety. I immediately compared her to Kim(5), but she wasn’t obsessed with masculinity as much as AzMarie was. I feel like Kim was willing to learn and improve without compromising herself whereas AzMarie saw herself as a star already and just wanted to remain “unique” in the first place. Yet I am still shocked how early she left.
7. My God, there were 3 Ashleys?? Lol, I didn’t know that. Well, Ashley number 3 or “Kyle” was probably the most controversial model in this cycle. She did so well on photoshoots, but I barely remember her good performance beyond dramas that were constantly surrounding her. I feel like girls just didn’t like her since she could easily just be “there” on set and her photo turned great – that is not easy to achieve. That being said I am not seeing Kyle going overseas simply because she lacked depth. Models like her can earn good money right off the bat, but they aren’t someone you’d want to watch on TV or listen (sorry Kyle).
8. It feels like I am writing this forever, but we are only reaching Seymone. She was a solid plus-size model, probably one of the best in all cycles, and unlike Kyle I expected her to go overseas. Her bottom 2s weren’t that bad in my opinion and considering how spectacular (the best of all Americans!) she was in that music video I’d give her another chance. Well, she had bad temper occasionally, but I wouldn’t eliminate her for that. Especially considering how young she was.
9. If all of the previous names had some “uncertainty” linked to them, Catherine would be the one I’d describe as one of the most stable contestants. Her pictures were beautiful, maybe not as strong as some FCO but her royal queen-like presence was just what this cycle needed! Such poise and elegance, even when disappointed she never let herself be unlikeable. This is probably one of the few placements that I completely agree with! Going overseas but not making it to the final is exactly what I expected from her.
10. I think next two contestants are the reason that this cycle got so messed up in order, so Eboni and Alisha both were extremely beautiful girls, maybe the most beautiful of all, but they got SO MANY CHANCES, beyond my understanding. Even though Eboni rocked on go-sees and Alisha had the right amount of “spice” to her, I was stunned to see how long both of them lasted. Louise, Seymone, AzMarie were all stronger in my opinion, but they never got a second chance. I mean Seymone failed quite a few times as well, but her lows weren’t as low as Eboni’s or Alisha’s (I’ll come back to it down below). So, coming back to our “brown sisters”… If we consider how striking both of them looked they could be easily in the final two (USA vs UK), two black girls would be an iconic ending, just like in cycle 3, but their performance was too deplorable even for 4-5^(th) spots they got. That being said, I liked both of them a lot, but they definitely overstayed.
11. Annaliese was a consistently solid competitor, even more solid than Catherine. One of the rare cases in this cycle when someone was actually progressing. Her initial level was pretty commercial and primitive, but towards the end she became much more editorial, and I liked her just for such growth. Miss “Excite-to-buy” was probably the only one BNTM contestant that improved since her original cycle and her personality was just on point. Such a great spokesperson, she would be irreplaceable on TV! I don’t know if agree with her placement though, ‘cause I feel like production didn’t expect her to go this far, but nevertheless she earned the bronze 100%. Maybe even top 2, because I don’t feel like Sophie was much better than her.
12. I could never imagine that Laura would get this far. Even though her pictures were so beautiful, she just wasn’t a model to me. Maybe an actress, because her go-see performance was just dreadful. I feel like she was kept just for her creativity and dramas since there was nothing interesting about her performance besides outstanding photos. Yet, unlike girls like Brittany (8) or Ann (15) they weren’t even editorial. Just beautiful pictures for some magazine, but definitely not high fashion. In other cycles girls like Laura got cut even before top 3 so she just got lucky.
13. Sophie was probably the closest to what I’d call a winner, but she was SO UNLIKEABLE in her original BNTM cycle that I still can’t get over it. Her pictures remained as editorial as they were, but I cannot say she improved as much as Annaliese did. Sophie was the best on the runway and only based on this criterion I’d give her 1^(st) place, but definitely not for her photos.

So, let's move to the final part.

“British Invasion” was quite interesting to watch just because of the number of girls I could call MEDIOCRE. If iconic cycles like 5 or 9 had a huge abyss between top 6 and bottom 6 girls, this time it’s a complete and total mess. I can barely define who was actually the best just because this cycle was full of unexpected eliminations, disqualifications and quitters. Seymone, Louise, AzMarie, Eboni, Alisha, Catherine, Kyle were all mediocre to me. Someone did better, someone did worse but nobody who’d stand out in their performance.

When it comes to the top, Sophie wasn’t that bad in my opinion but placing her with emotional wreck Laura was just unfair. That’s why in my imagination much more interesting final would be:

Alisha vs Eboni (two struggling black girls)   \\ Or

AzMarie vs Sophie (pure high fashion)  \\ Or

Sophie vs Annaliese (ultimate British battle)

Such outcomes would be the finals that a viewer DESERVED, since they are much more BALANCED in terms of competitive setting. Laura is someone I am not seeing making it to the final under any circumstances.

1pwayj6,https://i.redd.it/51jd14cdbl9g1.png,"Officially introducing my spider girl, Aranea Parker (no she isn't a spiderman OC, and the name Parker doesn't mean she is related to the Peter Parker. It's a reference.)","Aranea Parker is the fifth of six monster sisters. She is usually very quiet and keeps to herself, as most people who know what she is are either terrified of her, or call her gross.

While she may look human at first, her mouth can open to produce spider like fang and pinsirs. 
She also can open her six other eyes that are usually hidden.
And lastly, and most damning, she had four long, sharp, spider-like appendages that can extend from her back. They full on pierce out of her is a gross and gorey manner, this being the purpose of her common use of wearing more open shirts, so she doesn't rip her clothes.


Because of her recluse (hah get it, like a recluse spider) nature, she doesn't have as extravagant of a backstory as her sisters do. She does however seem to be the most fully ""adult"" of them all. In terms of saying she is the most functional. She had worked a job prior, and only had to leave in risk of, well, being a spider person. 
She has actually gone to online college classes.
And so she is the lost Knowledgable about human traditions. 


One night, she was in a bar, and was trying to enjoy a drink, not that alcohol was super effective in her. She could withstand many poisons, including that of alcohol, and so she wouldn't get drunk no matter how much whiskey she downs.

However, coffee, that was different. And so she paid the bartender a little extra, and knowing she was a regular, he hooked her up with a ln expresso shot.

She did end up leaving, intoxicated on caffeine, and was actually slobbering droll and her spider jaw hung loose. She pumped into a woman, knocking her in her butt. Aranea reached out an arm to help... A spider arm. She didn't even notice her spider limbs came out, but the sight of a drooling woman with spider limbs and a sharp jaw and pinches over a woman in the floor was a bad look.


However, to her surprise, the man that first intercepted this meeting was quick to notice Aranea seemed concerned and apologetic, and didn't actually want to hurt the woman. The man helped the woman to her feet, but she began to cuss and swear and slur at the spider woman, who accepted the words without much hassle.

The man took her back into the bar, and bought her another expresso shot, at her request, and himself a simple lemon drop.

He had a feeling where this was going, his massive home and laboratory was already housing multiple monster girls, and so he wasn't even halfway surprised when he carried her drunken, half asleep, half unaware body back to his home, and gave her an empty room to sleep the night away.


Come morning, she had a talk with the man who she learned was a scientist, and also met the other four girls who were living there. But to everyone's surprise, which they all assumed she would also be joining them, she declined. 

She explained she actually lived on the other side of the city, and was renting an apartment.  So she kindly thanked them all and left, heading home.

However, over time, she began to feel lonely once more, as the thought of having friends to live with would actually be pretty fun. 
A fewo that go by, however, without incident, except she was running out of money, and finding a new job was getting harder. She eventually was unable to pay her rent on time, and then a second and last month, she was told she would have to pack up. 

She thanks her landlady and leaves, with one location in mind. She knocks on the door to the massive house, and the scientist answered. She explained her situation, and while she didn't actually expect him to take her in, he kindly did so. Letting her stay, free of charge, for as long as she felt comfortable. 
Which happened to be a long time.


After a while, she went to check in the scientist, along with her new sisters, as it was his birthday, and she of all people wanted to show her gratitude for all his kindness. But they found he had passed away in his sleep. 

They buried him in his backyard beneath a tree, and made the mutual agreement to visit this laboratory every year, then wnt in to go their separate ways. 


Aranea, had managed to find a job while staying at the lab, and so she didn't have trouble paying for a new apartment. She works as a window cleaner for store and companies. It's good money. And so she spent her time either working, or at her apartment, comfortably in her own private domicile.
