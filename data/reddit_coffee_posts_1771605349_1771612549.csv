1ra3clz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ra3clz/medicated_friends_do_yall_drink_coffee/,Medicated Friends: Do y'all drink coffee?,"I've been diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive type for a few years now. I have tried just about every stimulant except Vyvanse, and some of them have worked but have aggravated a stomach disorder I have.

My doctor wanted to try 30mg Vyvanse and I took my first dose this morning at 6:30, I ate a small bowl of cereal and had a (large) cup of coffee at 7:00, and by 8:00 I was bouncin off the walls at work. Coffee usually doesn't have an effect on me, I drink it because I enjoy the flavor and experience. It's like the Vyvanse made my body react to coffee how a normal person would if they drank 3 cups.

I'm starting to wonder if having coffee this morning was a bad idea! I'm pretty jittery and my thoughts are a bit more scattered than they already typically are. I figured since it was in my routine to drink that I shouldn't change that for a new med so I could see what it did. Coming up on lunch time now, the coffee has started to finish its course so I'm feeling a somewhat better, just a bit shakey. Definitely less ""Go! Go! Go!"" than I was this morning.

I think I'll skip the coffee tomorrow and see how that goes, but I was curious to know if you guys have similar experiences or if you guys are still able to have caffeine with your meds?",1,1771612185.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1ra32n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ra32n4/how_to_get_over_a_breakup_fast_straightforward/,How to Get Over a Breakup FAST (Straightforward guide),"Ok, so right now your probably sad, angry, and furious, and to be honest thats completely normal and I can resonate with what your going through. It sucks, and you know that the other person completely did you dirty. They might have manipulated you, stabbed you in the back, got with your friends, cheated on you, and after all you have done for them, they took you for granted and left you.

I've been there and it sucks.

Now, your trying to move on. Your looking at the chess board and thinking whats the best next move to do. You think to yourself, ""Maybe I should text them"", or ""Maybe I should fully go ghost and lock in and just improve myself so much and become a millionaire and then they will regret leaving me and I will move on"". The cold hard truth is that no matter what path you go down, whether its trying to fix things with them, or go all into your work, you will still feel hurt inside. Contrary to what people on the internet tell you, ""working on yourself"" (while super beneficial) will not help you ACTUALLY get over them, and you'll just burn yourself out fast and then fall back into your old habits. 

  
""Well what what should I do?"" you might ask yourself. After being in multiple relationships myself (with over 10 women) in the past 3 years, and after trying out all different types of heartbreak tactics to try and move on, here is what I found works for me and for my friends to get over your EX as FAST and efficiently as possible. So in this short guide I hope to share some of the things that helped me and that can help you.

  
**First of all, let's talk about mindset.** If this person was your first partner, or someone you spent a ton of time with, you will naturally feel super connected to them. When you break up, your brain tricks you into thinking you'll never find someone like them ever again. This is a terrible, terrible mindset to have. The truth is, there are 8 billion people on this planet. Assuming you're straight, that's 4 BILLION potential partners out there waiting. You've probably heard 'there's plenty of fish in the sea' a million times and wanted to smack whoever said it but that's literally the simple truth. You found one person, got attached, and now you're acting like they're the only human you'll ever meet who could click with you. Reality check: there are SOOO many options, and wayyy more people who would actually love to be with you and treat you right. Now let me hit you with the even harsher part: if this person wanted to get with someone else, they simply didn't like you enough. Full stop. And no matter what excuses or stories you hear, the reason they didn't like you enough always comes down to exactly 2 things, and it's ALWAYS these two, I don't care what anyone else tries to tell you. It's either

1. You weren't wealthy enough and they found someone who can spoil them more, or
2. You weren't sexually attractive enough and they found someone better looking than you.

That's the TRUTH. Do whatever you want with it, cope, cry, get angry, level up, your call, but it always boils down to those two reasons. You can hit me with 'but we had a massive argument, that's why we broke up' all you want. Okay cool, if you were someone like Drake or Beyoncé, do you really think that person would leave you over an argument? OF COURSE NOT. Those celebrities usually have multiple partners orbiting them, and those partners don't give a single care about the other people in the picture. Why? Because as long as they're getting the attention, the lifestyle, the status, they stay loyal with all their heart. Not because of the celebrity's perfect actions or personality, but because of the looks, the money, and the status. Now the truth is, you and I (probably) aren't celebrities with hordes of people begging to get with us. But this simple mindset shift should make you realize something huge: if you had way more options, status, looks, or money in the equation, you wouldn't be sitting here feeling sad, desperate, or broken over one person walking away. You'd see them for what they are just one option that didn't work out and you'd keep it moving.

  
**Now, how do you ACTUALLY get over them.** And I will go over 2 scenarios that you can peruse depending on the situation. One of the scenarios you will likely fall into.

The first scenario is **IF** the breakup happened less than 48 hours ago and the other partner **DIDN'T** cheat on you or get with someone else in that timeframe, (contrary what people on the internet might say) I think its fine for you to go back to them and try and talk things through. You guys had a big argument and needed a little bit of time to cool down, but as long as the other partner didnt cheat, its honestly fine to go back to them.

If your EX did cheat, and its been over 48 hours, for your dignity and respect for yourself, leave them in the dust and never go back. They simply don't care for you and you have to move on.

Now to start moving on, the first thing you must realize is that the only way you will get over this person is that you must get attached to someone else. There are certain qualities you liked in your EX that you got attached to, and in the next person you meet you will see other qualities in them that might be different, that you will like too.

NOW, the first thing you must do to actually move on is to use dating apps and swipe one hundred times a day on them. I know this sounds cliché, but if you use dating apps and actually put effort into swiping as well as taking professional photos and looking your best, then you will get matches. If you are a girl, you will most likely naturally get tons of likes on your profile. This is great since you immediately have a large selection of men to choose from, and from there you should start going on multiple dates to sift through guys and figure out who is best for you. Speaking to the men now, you must work on your profile. If you do not have a good profile, there is zero point to using dating apps, since women are much more selective when choosing men than men are when choosing women. To make a good profile, first look at things from a woman's perspective of what she sees when swiping. You can do this by asking a female friend or by looking up ""Tinder from a girl's perspective"" online. What you will see is your competition, and you will realize that most men's profiles are terrible, which is actually great for you. Now, depending on how you look, find a celebrity lookalike of yourself and basically start copying their Instagram vibe. This will depend heavily on your appearance and personality, but aim to find someone who could be seen as a better version of you on Instagram and try to recreate their photos as closely as possible. That is it. Then, you must get the premium versions of the apps so that your messages can go to the top and your profile is shown more often. I want you to swipe one hundred times a day per dating app. Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble are your best options. To be honest, I would swipe one hundred times a day per app every morning right after waking up.

If you have a solid profile and you look somewhat good, you don't need to overcomplicate the messages you send. A simple ""hey"" will be fine, no need to write any jokes or weird messages. Act normally and I swear you will be flooded with dates.

Then comes the actual date. Here’s what I recommend: Don’t go splurging or trying to impress with fancy stuff. Skip the expensive restaurants, long drawn-out activities, or anything that screams “I’m desperate to win you over.” Keep it simple and low-pressure, a quick coffee spot if it’s cold out, or an ice cream place in the summer. That’s it. Chill vibe, low commitment, cheap as hell. Plus, you’re not setting the bar sky-high right away, so they don’t start expecting bougie dates every time or think you’re some baller who’s gonna drop stacks forever. Play it smart, start basic, build from there.

From this moment onwards, you should be meeting new people and going on so many dates that you have fully forgotten about the other person by now. And thats it! Thats exactly how to move on!! Congratulations if you followed my exact steps and mentality, you will have found at least someone else you like within a month.



I know people like resources, so here are a few helpful resources you can use to level up your dating game that I know of that worked well for me and my friends:

Book Recommendations:

\- How to Win friends and Influence people by Dale Carnegie

\- Atomic Habits by James Clear

Mobile App Recommendations:

\- Headspace | For Guided meditation and mindfulness

\- Healify: Heartbreak Recovery | No contact tracker, AI Relationship coach, step by step heartbreak recovery guides and tons of tools to get over a breakup

  
Other than these resources above, you just have to keep shooting your shot, and improving! I hope you enjoyed this read and learned a lot. I wish you the best of luck.

1ra30t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Low-Astronaut3147/comments/1ra30t3/first_weeks_abroad_expectations_vs_reality_and/,First Weeks Abroad: Expectations vs Reality (And What No One Tells You),"# 

You imagine your first week abroad like a movie montage.

You land.  
You smile at the airport.  
You move into your room.  
You explore the city.  
You post pictures.

Expectation: excitement, independence, aesthetic coffee shops, instant friendships.

Reality: exhaustion.

The first weeks abroad are not bad. They’re just overwhelming. And no one prepares you for how mentally heavy that adjustment can feel.

# Expectation: Everything Will Feel Magical

Before arriving, I thought I would immediately feel grown-up and independent. I imagined myself confidently navigating public transport, cooking balanced meals, and making friends effortlessly.

I expected clarity.

Instead, I felt overstimulated.

New country.  
New currency.  
New accents.  
New systems.  
New expectations.

Even buying something from the supermarket required mental effort. You don’t realise how much you rely on familiarity until it disappears.

# The First-Week Challenges

Everyone’s challenges are different, but here were mine:

# 1. Navigating Public Transport

Understanding routes, tapping cards correctly, figuring out peak vs off-peak — it sounds simple until you’re holding up a line of commuters behind you.

# 2. Cooking in a Shared Kitchen

Sharing fridge space. Labeling food. Timing meals around strangers. It’s a small adjustment, but it requires awareness.

# 3. Academic Differences

The UK academic system can feel different from what many international students are used to. Lectures may be less spoon-fed. Independent study is expected. Professors assume you’ll read beyond slides.

The shift from structured guidance to self-managed learning can feel intimidating.

# 4. Unexpected Homesickness

Homesickness doesn’t always arrive dramatically. Sometimes it shows up quietly — when you’re eating alone, when the weather feels grey, when time zones make calls difficult.

You might miss small things:  
The sound of your house.  
The comfort of familiar food.  
The ease of speaking without thinking about pronunciation.

# What Surprised Me

What surprised me most was this:

Everyone was adjusting too.

The confident-looking students? Also confused.  
The people who seemed social instantly? Also nervous.

The difference was that some people hid it better.

Once I realised that adjustment is universal, I stopped feeling like I was behind.

# First-Week Learnings

Here’s what those early days taught me:

# 1. You Don’t Need to “Settle” Immediately

There is no prize for adjusting the fastest.

Give yourself permission to feel unfamiliar. Settling in is gradual. You build comfort through repetition.

# 2. Small Tasks Build Confidence

The first time I:

* Did a full grocery shop alone
* Found my lecture hall without checking Maps
* Had a proper conversation with a classmate

Each small task made the city feel less intimidating.

Confidence doesn’t arrive all at once. It accumulates.

# 3. Routine Is Stability

The moment I created a simple routine, everything shifted.

Wake up.  
Attend lectures.  
Study block.  
Evening walk.  
Cook dinner.

Routine reduces decision fatigue. When everything feels new, structure becomes grounding.

# Expectations vs Reality: The Honest Comparison

Expectation: I will make close friends immediately.  
Reality: You meet many people before you find your circle.

Expectation: I will feel independent instantly.  
Reality: Independence feels uncomfortable before it feels empowering.

Expectation: I will love every moment.  
Reality: Some days are boring. Some days are lonely. Most days are ordinary.

And that’s okay.

# The Turning Point

Somewhere between week two and week four, something changes quietly.

You stop converting every pound to your home currency.  
You stop checking directions obsessively.  
You stop feeling like a visitor.

You start feeling like you belong — even if just a little.

Adjustment doesn’t happen in a dramatic moment. It happens through repetition.

# What I’d Tell Every Student Landing This Month

Your first week is not a performance. It’s a transition.

You are not behind if:

* You don’t have a friend group yet.
* You feel tired constantly.
* You miss home more than you expected.

Give yourself at least a month before judging your experience.

Growth often feels uncomfortable while it’s happening.

# The Truth About the First Weeks

They are messy.  
They are tiring.  
They are emotional.

But they are also powerful.

Because during those weeks, you’re building something invisible — resilience.

And one day, you’ll look back and realise that the version of you who felt overwhelmed in week one is the same version who now navigates life abroad confidently.

The first weeks don’t define your experience. They shape it.

1ra2zs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1ra2zs4/most_apps_compete_on_features_while_losing_on/,Most Apps Compete on Features While Losing on Experience!!!!," Lately I’ve been entertaining myself in a very questionable way.

Reading negative reviews, Not even kidding, it’s more educational than half the startup advice floating around. When users get annoyed enough, they explain exactly what’s broken with absolutely no filter. It’s basically raw product feedback without the corporate sugar coating.

Some repetitive comments that caught my eye were:

**Weather apps are weirdly dramatic for tools that check the Sky.**

you look outside. Perfect sunshine. You check the app. Storm incoming.

Every weather app behaves like it has a flair for suspense. AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, doesn’t matter. Reviews are full of people saying the same thing: How are you this confident and this wrong? Honestly, an app that just admits uncertainty would already feel more trustworthy. Nobody expects psychic powers. Just don’t hallucinate rain.

**Calendar apps love turning simple planning into admin Work**

All you wanted was to note a meeting. Suddenly you’re managing colors, views, settings, reminders, layouts. Google Calendar wins because it’s glued into everything, but using it isn’t exactly a joyful experience. There’s a lot of silent friction in scheduling that nobody talks about. Users don’t want to “manage” time. They just want clarity.

**To do list apps that drives us crazy**

Task apps have a habit of feature spirals. You install it to remember groceries. Next thing you know you’re dealing like that one girl with color coded notes. By the time everything is perfectly organized, you’re too tired to actually do the tasks. There's a reason minimal tools like Todoist keep their user base. Fast entry, low ceremony, done. Complexity is rarely the selling point users think they want.

**Expense trackers that eat us alive Manual**

expense logging always sounds responsible. It also always collapses. Nobody consistently records every coffee purchase like a disciplined finance monk. Apps like Walnut got popular by scraping SMS data because they stopped pretending users would behave perfectly. Good financial tools assume laziness and work with it, not against it.

**Builder tools underestimate how annoying design decisions are**

This one’s funny. Creator tools love advertising freedom. Total control. Infinite customization. In reality, that often means endless tiny decisions. Padding, alignment, spacing, fonts, layouts. It’s mentally draining. A lot of builders would happily trade freedom for sane defaults and structure. That’s why tools like PrettiFlow([https://prettiflow.tech](https://prettiflow.tech/)) are interesting. They lean into components and guardrails so you’re not stuck micromanaging visuals for hours.

Users aren’t begging for futuristic inventions. They mostly want existing categories to stop being irritating. The opportunities are often painfully boring, sitting inside products people already pay for but complain about nonstop. Frustration is a pretty honest signal.

Final verdict to all the startup fellas out there, start solving existing problems rather than trying to search for new problems to solve!!!!.",2,1771611407.0,buildinpublic,1,1.0,False

Every season I see travelers panic when rain shows up in the forecast — especially in spring and autumn. Honestly? It’s not a disaster.

Dubrovnik in the rain is quieter, moodier, and actually kind of beautiful. You just need to plan it differently.

Here’s how I’d structure the day:

**If it’s light rain / drizzle:**

* Short Old Town loop (Stradun reflections are amazing)
* One museum (Rector’s Palace or Cathedral)
* Long coffee stop (this is basically a Croatian sport)
* Early dinner or wine bar

**If it’s heavy rain or windy:**

* Museum cluster in the Old Town (they’re close together)
* Long konoba lunch
* Escape room (fully indoors and surprisingly fun)
* Wine tasting, brewery, or even spa

**Winter tip:** the limestone streets get VERY slippery. Good shoes matter more than umbrellas.

• Love ARR music
• Love cooking and cooking for my loved ones

At that time we were ok friends, not super close not cold either, and she had a serious relationship going on. We studied at the same university but we rarely met up, maybe 1 time a year after the internship. 2.5 years ago, I moved abroad and 2 years ago her relationship ended. Every now and then I messaged her and kept in touch. 

This autumn I when I was visiting home, I texted her if she wanted to meet up, she was happy to catch up and we met up. I was only expecting to meet for a few hours, have a coffee or beer and catch up, but she brought a ""get to know eachother"" type game and we ended up spending 7ish hours together. I then left the country again and we chatted a few times while I was gone but nothing much. Then I visited again now in february and we met up again, we were both excited to meet up. 

She set aside an entire day, we went for a park walk and after that for food and beers. It was very nice and friendly again and I said that before I leave the country, I could visit the city she lives in again. We have been chatting losely for the last 2 weeks since we met again, mostly friendly things, and in a ""mail"" way (she has diagnosed adhd, and she is really not very good at having a conversation on messagging apps, she is very nice to talk to in person tho, but she also reliably responds to whatever I text her in the mornings but I feel like she needs some space). Last time we couldnt check out a cafe that looked nice and also we talked about visiting another city park. We agreed to meet up next week and go for this plan and it feels like we are both excited to meet. 

I think I started to develop feelings for her that are more than friendly. But I live in a different country and I dont think that a long distance relationship would be a feasible option for either of us. Logically I think I should not engage further and keep it friendly but I aslo feel like there is a real connection, we are having a great time together and we are comfortable. I also dont really know if she is into me or not in a more than friendly way. 

Last time we met, we went to a park, sat on a bench and chatted for some time. We are comfortable hugging when we meet and say bye, she also randomly took a picture of me when we were having food saying that the pic is not going anywhere but that it was a nice moment and she wanted to keep a picture of it. After we met up last time, I went to visit another friend and in that general region there was some flooding, so she reached out to me asking if all was ok. 

I dont know how to go forward from this point on. I really enjoy spending time with her and would love to know here better, as somekne who is more than a friend. But I also feel like it would be unfair to put her and myself in a long distance situationship. I feel like having expectations at this point is wrong and I should just see how things go on our next meet up (for which I could also use some suggestions) but I am also afraid of missing out on her.

He especially stresses out about arriving at the bus stop at the same time as the bus, so he’d have to rush out the car and race to catch the bus, that, just, he just hates that.

Now, I could drive him to the bus stop every morning, but my husband likes to do it when he can, so I only do it on the days that my husband has to be at work early. Today was one of the days that my husband was going to drive him, however, he was running late. My husband is a total spaz in the morning, good lord don’t get in his way and don’t even try to talk to him! So it’s like we’re on eggshells trying to even suggest that I take him, instead, but he was just making his coffee right at the time that we usually leave. So I casually offered to take him. He huffed like we were being stupid, and said he didn’t think it was necessary. I said yeah, you’re probably right, but he’s stressing about being late, to which my husband rolled his eyes, looked at our son and said, “Go!” and stormed out of the room. 

He didn’t even give him a hug goodbye which he always does. 

Fast-forward about 10 minutes. I’m sitting in my car after dropping the boy off and I text my husband about the way he treated our son. I said it was shameful that he took it out on him and that he made him feel bad about being anxious, that he should be setting an example, not punishing him!

I was expecting his response to be apologetic for overreacting, “I’m not good in the morning, yadda, yadda”, still no excuse, but …

My husband‘s response to my text was “you’ll be taking him every day from now on.”",13,1771611317.0,AmIOverreacting,35,0.78,False

I see a lot of folks in here asking about how to source green coffee directly from farms without going through the usual broker middlemen, so I wanted to drop a line and introduce myself.

A little background: I’m an LA-based camera operator and DP, but I’ve been living full-time in Costa Rica for the last 10 years. Over time, I've built strong local connections that allow me to bypass the traditional export routes and go straight to the source.

Case in point: Yesterday I rode in the back of a van hauling a 3 quintales micro-lot of 2,000m Washed Geisha and some high-altitude SL28 down from the Los Santos region. We literally just pulled these today after spending the night breaking bread at the farmer's family cabinas.

I’m hand-carrying a small lot of this back to Los Angeles on March 5th. While I’ll be sampling some out to a few local shops, my main goal right now is to broaden my connections. I would absolutely love to get an official score on this lot. If there are any certified Q-Graders or experienced home-roasters in the LA area who want to cup and evaluate this, I’d gladly trade some of this green Geisha or SL28 for your palate and time.

Also, since I live down here full-time, if anyone is actively looking for boots on the ground in Costa Rica to help navigate farm connections or the export side of things, I’m happy to chat.

1ra2xnn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ra2xnn,Good Look Ink's Indianapolis Office,"Posting an overview of the Good Look Ink Indianapolis office since a lot of people ask what the vibe is like before they come in. Pics are below.

**Where the Indy office is** 

The We Grow Hair Indy / PAI Medical Group clinic is at 3500 DePauw Blvd, Suite 2011, Indianapolis, IN 46268. It’s inside The Pyramids Office Park (the distinctive sloped glass office buildings). 

We're in Pyramid 2.

**Parking / getting in** 

Parking is the least stressful part: this complex is basically built for easy in-and-out, with lots of surface parking. If you’ve never been to The Pyramids before, it can feel like “wait, which building?”—so in the photos I included the exterior + the main entrance.

Our office is the whole first floor in Pyramid 2 so you can't miss us.

**What the space is (and isn’t)** 

This isn’t a retail storefront. It’s a clinic environment where SMP is offered inside a broader hair-restoration practice. So the vibe is more private + appointment-based, not “busy lobby with foot traffic.” 

It's a relaxed, comfortable, but organized vibe.

**Small tips that help first-timers**

If you’re anxious about being seen: this is an office-park clinic—people are coming and going for all kinds of appointments. You’re not walking into a barbershop with an audience. Arrive a few minutes early the first time just so you’re not hunting for the right door/suite.

The office has free coffee and drinks. We recommend dressing in layers as the building is on he cooler side.

**Consultations**

We offer free consultations online at [www.goodlookink.com](http://www.goodlookink.com), and you can also schedule in-person consultations with the office staff.",1,1771611282.0,goodlookink,0,1.0,False

quiet feet on tired floors,

counting lunches, folding small socks,

holding together a world

no one sees you rebuild each day.

Your hands smell like coffee and comfort,

like prayers whispered over sleeping heads,

like dishes washed long after the house goes silent.

You carry love the way the ocean carries salt 

so naturally you forget it’s heavy.

You learned how to stay soft

even when life taught you to be strong.

You learned how to give

without applause,

without witness,

without someone saying, I see you trying.

In the mirror, you search for proof

that devotion leaves a mark 

not in perfection,

but in the way your eyes still choose kindness

after disappointment knocks again.

You kneel in the quiet hours,

not asking for riches or rescue,

just this small holy hope:

God, let someone recognize the way I love.

Let someone notice the steady flame

I’ve kept alive with shaking hands.

Because you are a good mother

in the way you listen when little voices tremble.

You are a faithful wife

in the way you keep believing love can grow again.

You are a woman who stays

even when her own heart feels unseen.

And maybe one day

someone will look at you

not as the background to their life

but as the miracle you have always been 

a home made of patience,

a heart made of prayer,

a love that never stopped choosing.

Until then,

you keep showing up.

You keep loving anyway.

And heaven counts every quiet sacrifice

even when the world forgets to say your name. 🌙",3,1771611273.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

We can learn from other sites and demand better.  They want to get away with the most relaxed requirements against them from the municipality where they're developing.  Took me awhile to compile some info, and I did (ironically) use Chatgpt to better formulate the information and what we should demand from our city on this deal.  It sounds like its a done deal and it will happen without us based on what the user told us, because we are being told no spot has been selected.   
  
 I'll be heading to the meeting at the coffee shop in an hour and listening to their talking points.  (its at iron bank at 2, show up).  


# 1) “No tax breaks/incentives will be provided… $70M+ annually… $55M to schools”

* **“No local tax breaks” is not the same as “no tax breaks.”** Georgia has a major **statewide data center sales tax exemption** (equipment purchases are the big-ticket items). Even if the city/county doesn’t abate property taxes, the state exemption can still shift real cost onto the public. Georgia’s own audits and watchdog analyses highlight how large the foregone revenue can be. ([audits.ga.gov](https://www.audits.ga.gov/ReportSearch/download/33298?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Property-tax projections often use best-case assumptions**: full buildout, high assessed value, stable millage, and **limited depreciation/abatements**. But data center equipment depreciates fast; assessed values can fall; and many jurisdictions later negotiate payment structures (PILOT-like arrangements) or carve-outs.
* **School funding claims can be misleading in Georgia.** Even if the digest grows, Georgia’s school funding formulas and local millage dynamics can mean the “schools win big” narrative doesn’t cleanly match reality year-to-year.
* Written confirmation of **no state exemption applications** (or a frank estimate if they will apply).
* A **tax revenue model** showing ranges (base/bull/bear), including **depreciation assumptions**.

# 2) “No utility bills (water/electric) will be passed on to Columbus taxpayers…”

* **Electric system costs can still hit ratepayers** even if the *facility* pays its own monthly bill. Georgia is actively retooling rates and resource plans because data centers are driving huge load growth, and critics argue the risk of overbuild can land on everyone if projections don’t materialize. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/0b377d6a4a57c9353c0eb577b8951af3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Georgia Power’s and Southern Company’s own public statements acknowledge **massive capital spend increases** tied to data center/large-load demand. Those costs don’t evaporate; they flow through regulated rate cases over time. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/southern-co-forecasts-annual-profit-below-estimates-raises-spending-plan-2026-02-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Water/sewer: even if the developer pays “its share,” the city may still have **upstream costs** (treatment capacity, pumping, storage, redundancy, distribution mains) and operational risk.

**What to demand**

* A **ratepayer impact statement** from utilities / PSC filings logic: what upgrades are required, who pays, what happens if load doesn’t show up.

# 3) “City can draw 70M gallons/day… data center will draw 80k… only 0.001% increase”

* **The 0.001% framing is a classic dilution tactic**: it compares against a very large permitted maximum, not the binding constraints during drought, heat waves, infrastructure failures, or peak demand.
* Data center water use is highly variable and can scale with **expansions, hotter summers, and higher compute density**. Also, “campus” projects frequently **phase** into larger footprints than initially emphasized.
* Georgia has examples where water demand becomes locally significant. A widely cited case: a Meta facility in Newton County reportedly uses **\~500,000 gallons/day (\~10% of county consumption),,** illustrating how the “tiny share” narrative can be very untrue at local scale. ([Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/land-lines-magazine/articles/land-water-impacts-data-centers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**What to demand**

* A binding **maximum daily withdrawal** and **maximum annual withdrawal**, with **public reporting** and penalties for exceedances.

# 4) “Closed loop recycling… won’t dump water directly into creeks/rivers”

* “Closed loop” cooling still typically requires **make-up water** and produces **blowdown** (concentrated water that must be treated/discharged). The question isn’t “do they recycle some water,” it’s: **how much net withdrawal**, and **where does discharge go**, under what permit, with what temperature/chemical limits.
* Some operators have done advanced water programs (e.g., using recycled/gray water and discharging treated effluent), but that does **not** mean the project has zero water impact, just a different profile of impact. ([DataCenterKnowledge](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/green-materials/google-recycling-water-for-atlanta-data-center?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* If the pitch uses language like “they will not dump from the system directly into creeks and rivers like others,” that’s often **PR contrast** rather than a technical guarantee. Discharge is normally governed by permits; the public should see the permit plan.

**What to demand**

* Target **WUE (water usage effectiveness)** numbers, third-party verified.
* Disclose whether they’ll use **potable water vs reclaimed** and publish discharge permit details.

# 5) “Developer will spend $20–$30M replacing water/sewer infrastructure… main line… helps residents too… no fees passed to taxpayers”

* Infrastructure “commitments” can be **structured to primarily serve the project**, with limited long-term benefit to residents, especially if lines are oversized for the campus and only incidentally helpful elsewhere.
* “No fees passed to taxpayers” is hard to guarantee because:
   * cities often finance large utility capital projects over decades;
   * operations/maintenance costs persist;
   * future expansions may shift the burden later.
* If the lines “will be utilized for residents and businesses along the way,” that can also mean **future growth pressure** (more development, more demand, more capital needs).

**What to demand**

* A signed **developer agreement**: scope, schedule, who owns the assets, who maintains them, and explicit **claw backs** if the project pauses or downsizes.

# 6) “Site is rural… minimal light/sound impact… few negatively impacted”

* Rural siting often reduces political friction, but it can **increase ecological footprint** (larger land disturbance, longer utility runs, habitat fragmentation).
* “Minimal sound/light” depends on: generator testing schedules, mechanical yard design, berms/walls, lighting plan, and enforcement. These are often **value-engineered** later unless locked in.
* Data center campuses also produce **traffic impacts during construction** and periodic heavy maintenance bursts.

**What to demand**

* Enforceable **noise limits at property lines**, generator testing restrictions, dark-sky compliant lighting, and independent monitoring.

# 7) “195 full-time local employees… training pipeline… plus construction jobs… each job supports 4–6 more”

**Counterpoints / skepticism**

* **Data center job claims are a major controversy in Georgia right now.** Reporting this year highlights that economic impact/job production was **overstated** in official narratives around tax breaks, with corrections issued and scrutiny increasing. ([WABE](https://www.wabe.org/georgia-data-centers-economic-impact-massively-overstated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* “195 jobs” for a *campus* is possible, but you should assume:
   * many roles can be **specialized** (network, electrical, mechanical), and firms often bring in experienced staff from other markets;
   * a portion may be **contractors** (not counted as direct FTEs, or counted inconsistently);
   * “jobs ramp over years” is exactly where projects can underdeliver: the build happens, the tax benefits happen, the staffing stays lean.
* The “each data center job creates six more” line is **industry coalition messaging** (not a neutral fact). It should be treated as advocacy, not a guarantee. ([https://www.wtvm.com](https://www.wtvm.com/2026/02/12/proposed-5b-data-center-project-promises-195-new-jobs-columbus-area/))

**What to demand**

* A legally binding **jobs commitment**: minimum FTEs, local hiring thresholds, wage floors, and **annual audits** with claw backs.

# 8) “They’ll help the energy grid… maybe solar… don’t be misled, solar won’t offset all use…”

* “They’re doing their part” is vague. In practice, Georgia is approving **very large generation expansions** largely driven by data centers, and critics argue residential/small business customers can still be exposed to long-term costs if forecasts are wrong. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/0b377d6a4a57c9353c0eb577b8951af3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* Even if the campus buys renewables or builds solar, **capacity vs energy** matters: peak load at the wrong time still requires grid buildout (gas, transmission, storage).
* Southern Company/Georgia Power have publicly tied **major capital spending** to meeting data center-driven load growth, again signaling that “we’ll offset it” doesn’t stop system-wide spending. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/southern-co-forecasts-annual-profit-below-estimates-raises-spending-plan-2026-02-19/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**What to demand**

* Clear commitments: on-site generation? contracted PPAs? firm capacity contributions? interconnection costs? timeline?

# 9) “City needs tax revenue badly… this helps avoid property tax hikes…”

* This is an emotional argument, not a fiscal proof. A city can still end up with:
   * higher utility/road/administrative burdens,
   * public safety planning costs (even if “passive,” critical infrastructure drives planning),
   * and a budget that becomes dependent on a single large taxpayer (risk concentration).
* And if **state-level exemptions** balloon (as Georgia’s projections suggest), the state can face budget pressure that comes back to locals in other ways. ([Good Jobs First](https://goodjobsfirst.org/georgia-data-center-tax-breaks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**What to demand**

* A conservative fiscal impact study that includes **public service costs**, utility O&M, and downside scenarios (buildout stalls, reassessment drops, etc.).

# 10) “If we turn it down, we signal we don’t want tech business… we need all we can get”

* You don’t have to “turn it down” to be skeptical, you can **condition approval** on enforceable performance and transparency.
* Georgia cities are already responding to data center pressure with **moratoriums and tighter zoning review** to understand impacts before approving. The Hampton area example shows local governments pausing to reassess. ([Data Center Dynamics](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/another-data-center-campus-is-being-planned-outside-atlanta-georgia-hampton-technology-park-owner-llc-has-filed-a-developments-of-regional-impact-dri-application-with-the-georgia-department-of-community-affairs-for-a-new-campus-in-the-city-of-hampto/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* “Signal value” shouldn’t override: water security, grid costs, land use, and enforceable public benefit.

**What to demand**

* A development agreement that survives PR cycles: claw backs, reporting, caps, and penalties.

# “Look directly at the group developing this project” (Habitat Partners)  what to be skeptical about

* The public materials identify **Habitat Partners** as the Development Authority’s partner. ([https://www.wtvm.com](https://www.wtvm.com/2026/02/12/proposed-5b-data-center-project-promises-195-new-jobs-columbus-area/))
* There is **name ambiguity**: online, “Habitat Partners” appears to refer to at least two different entities (a **natural resource / conservation-oriented firm** at [habitatpartners.com](http://habitatpartners.com), and a **NYC venture fund** at habitatpartners.co). That’s not wrongdoing, but it’s a *real due-diligence hazard,* and you should insist officials clearly identify the legal entity (LLC, officers, track record, prior projects). ([Habitat Partners](https://habitatpartners.com/about-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* If the partner’s core business is “site assembly / conservation / mitigation banking / advisory,” they may not be the long-term operator, meaning many “promises” depend on whichever hyperscaler/tenant ultimately lands.

**Due diligence asks**

* Legal entity name + registration, principals, prior comparable deals, litigation, bankruptcies, and references from other municipalities.
* Who is the *end operator/tenant*? If “not announced,” then many claims are provisional.

# Where “promises weren’t upheld” in Georgia (examples you can cite in public debate)

These aren’t about your specific project, but they are directly relevant patterns in Georgia right now:

* **Economic impact / job claims under scrutiny:** Reporting indicates Georgia data centers’ economic impact and job production were **massively overstated**, with corrections and heightened skepticism around incentives. ([WABE](https://www.wabe.org/georgia-data-centers-economic-impact-massively-overstated/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Tax breaks ballooning:** Analyses and state documents show Georgia’s data center exemptions can reach **billions in foregone revenue**, raising questions about whether the public is getting proportional benefit. ([Good Jobs First](https://goodjobsfirst.org/georgia-data-center-tax-breaks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Grid buildout risk:** Georgia regulators approved major generation expansion to serve projected data center load; critics argue ordinary customers could carry risk if projections miss. ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/0b377d6a4a57c9353c0eb577b8951af3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# A practical “skeptic’s checklist” for Columbus to require before approvals

1. **Binding jobs & local hire commitments** \+ annual third-party audit + claw backs.
2. **Water caps** (daily/annual), WUE targets, and public reporting.
3. **Noise/light** enforceable standards + monitoring.
4. **Utility cost allocation**: written statement on who pays for upgrades and stranded-cost protections.
5. **Tax transparency**: state exemption use, depreciation modeling, and worst-case revenue scenarios.
6. **Operator disclosure** (or conditions that trigger re-approval once operator is known).",12,1771611187.0,ColumbusGA,4,0.93,False

Reading negative reviews, Not even kidding, it’s more educational than half the startup advice floating around. When users get annoyed enough, they explain exactly what’s broken with absolutely no filter. It’s basically raw product feedback without the corporate sugar coating.

Some repetitive comments that caught my eye were:

**Weather apps are weirdly dramatic for tools that check the Sky.**

you look outside. Perfect sunshine. You check the app. Storm incoming.

Every weather app behaves like it has a flair for suspense. AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, doesn’t matter. Reviews are full of people saying the same thing: How are you this confident and this wrong? Honestly, an app that just admits uncertainty would already feel more trustworthy. Nobody expects psychic powers. Just don’t hallucinate rain.

**Calendar apps love turning simple planning into admin Work**

All you wanted was to note a meeting. Suddenly you’re managing colors, views, settings, reminders, layouts. Google Calendar wins because it’s glued into everything, but using it isn’t exactly a joyful experience. There’s a lot of silent friction in scheduling that nobody talks about. Users don’t want to “manage” time. They just want clarity.

**To do list apps that drives us crazy**

Task apps have a habit of feature spirals. You install it to remember groceries. Next thing you know you’re dealing like that one girl with color coded notes. By the time everything is perfectly organized, you’re too tired to actually do the tasks. There's a reason minimal tools like Todoist keep their user base. Fast entry, low ceremony, done. Complexity is rarely the selling point users think they want.

**Expense trackers that eat us alive Manual**

expense logging always sounds responsible. It also always collapses. Nobody consistently records every coffee purchase like a disciplined finance monk. Apps like Walnut got popular by scraping SMS data because they stopped pretending users would behave perfectly. Good financial tools assume laziness and work with it, not against it.

**Builder tools underestimate how annoying design decisions are**

This one’s funny. Creator tools love advertising freedom. Total control. Infinite customization. In reality, that often means endless tiny decisions. Padding, alignment, spacing, fonts, layouts. It’s mentally draining. A lot of builders would happily trade freedom for sane defaults and structure. That’s why tools like PrettiFlow([https://prettiflow.tech](https://prettiflow.tech/)) are interesting. They lean into components and guardrails so you’re not stuck micromanaging visuals for hours.

Users aren’t begging for futuristic inventions. They mostly want existing categories to stop being irritating. The opportunities are often painfully boring, sitting inside products people already pay for but complain about nonstop. Frustration is a pretty honest signal.

Final verdict to all the startup fellas out there, start solving existing problems rather than trying to search for new problems to solve!!!!.",1,1771611181.0,ProductHunters,0,1.0,False

• Prefer honesty, emotional maturity, and mutual respect
• Love ARR music
• Love cooking and cooking for my loved ones

This story can be enjoyed by those who haven't watched the series or have prior knowledge of the story, so enjoy and don't hate me. Also, this is my first story, sorry if this sucks.

Part 1- Hayato Kawajiri

Scrambled eggs, sausages, green beans and a flask of orange juice. A very normal Kawajiri breakfast. But this was not a normal Kawajiri morning, Hayato solely knew. For there was a viper in the nest, and it wore his father’s skin.

The man emulating the corpse of Kosaku Kawajiri was dressed in his standard working attire- plain white suit, striped shirt and green tie plastered with cats, for that smidge of personal flair. Perfectly responsible for a middle-class salesman. Not of a rampant serial killer, with a tendency for identity theft and rapid combustion of his victims’ corpses. *That murderer lies in my father’s skin. I will get rid of him by midday. I know, big talk for an eleven year old.*

Morioucho Radio had just begun playing Jamiroquai when that man drank his coffee.

His customarily sour frown was replaced by a cheery demeanour unfamiliar to Hayato- snow-white teeth prying from a jolly smile, voice humming through Virtual Insanity’s chorus smoother than honey. His confidence unnerved the boy more than anything- *what is this serpent planning?* 

A crash awoke Hayato from his thoughts. On his left, lay his mother’s favourite china teapot, shattered beyond repair. She sat huddled over it, teeth gritted in remorse.

“Damnitt Hayato!” she bellowed. “Why won’t you just listen to me for once! I was asking you to carry the teapot!” Looking back, Hayato did remember a distinct speaking sound from his mother’s mouth, but he was focused on bigger fish. 

He stuttered on his apologies, which his mother didn’t take well. “You don’t even care, do you?”

And then, the viper came slithering.

The man positioned himself behind his mother, and took a hand to her neck. “Oh dear Shinobu. It was only a tea set, don’t worry. I’ll get a new one.” His elaborate language was also new, replacing the soft grunts once echoed. Shinobu buried her face in his chest, and he kissed her on the forehead, all the while his violet eyes smeared over his supposed son. He smirked. He knew he had won the game. *For now.*

“Well,” Shinobu spoke, wiping her eyes. “You boys should be off. It’s almost past 20.”

The man admired his watch. The watch he stole from Hayato’s father. “Seems so. Come, Hayato. Let’s walk.”

“Wait, Kosaku. You have tea on your shirt.” A splodge of tea lay at the foot of his suit.

“It's fine honey. I'll get it changed later. Hayato, let’s move!” *I thought the tea pot was empty.*

By 8:20, the Kawajiri boys were out the door, and on the streets of Morioh. The man strutted with slick confidence, while Hayato walked meekly beside him.

“I’m feeling refreshed.” the man said. “I’m feeling new. I’m sure you can tell. You like the hair? I think it’s a bit much. I preferred my old head of hair to your father’s.”

“Then go back. Leave us.”

“No can do, little Hayato. You know my secret.”

“I’ll tell everyone if you don’t.”

“I fear that’s out of the question. You see, I developed something after our talk in the shower last night.”

“And what would that be?”

“Immortality. Inevitably. Immunity. Invincibility. A variety of I-related attributes.”

“How's that?”

“I suppose you’ll find out. Tell Rohan, Yoshikage Kira said hi. And keep your eyes on your watch.”

With that, Yoshikage Kira walked into the distance, and left Hayato on the pavement, at exactly 8:21. *Yoshikage Kira. I must remember that name. And who the hell is Rohan?*

The morning was cold and crisp, and Hayato had forgotten his coat. He envied the man leaning on his car a few paces ahead, wrapped in a green overcoat and matching gloves. He also envied the man’s pristine abs poking out his tank top, and his stylish brown boot-pants far outmatched Hayato’s awkward wellies. His raven hair was swooped to one side, held up by a pretentious headband with two heavy earrings reaching his chin. *That’s one bizarre outfit,* Hayato remarked, as he passed the slender onlooker. Hayato checked his watch. 8:22.

The man slapped his phone while Hayato passed. “Damn that Josuke. Wake up!” he muttered, before laying eyes on Hayato. “Excuse me, are you Hayato Kawajiri? I’m Kishibe Rohan,” he asked. Hayato ignored him, fearing Kira’s warning. But in an instant, he crumbled to the ground, his face opening like a book. He found himself completely immobile- skin slowly molding into paper.

“HEAVEN’S DOOR!” Rohan cried, and turned Hayato onto his back.  He began frantically turning the pages that once resembled his skin, Hayato unable to stop him.

“Hayato. Aged 11. Mother, Shinobu, Alive. Father, Kosasku, Deceased?” *How is this man reading my life? Is he like Kira?* Rohan turned more pages. 8:23.

“An old man with his zipper undone will pass by in 4 seconds.” Rohan read aloud. Hayato, pinned against Rohan’s car, saw as  predicted, an old man wandering by, blissfully unaware of his undone fly.

“He will sneeze in 2 seconds.” The man sneezed and spluttered.

“A group of teenage girls will laugh at him in 3.” The girls snorted at his disposition. *What has Kira done to me?*

Rohan raised his perfectly-groomed eyebrows, and turned another page. “I don’t know if you can hear me, Hayato Kawajiri.” *10 seconds till 24.* “Your father is not who you think he is.” *5, 4, 3,* “Yoshikage Kira, I’ve-

“KILLER QUEEN, BITES THE DUST!” radiated Kira’s voice. Rohan stumbled back, back erupting in blood as Hayato sat helpless. He gasped, more explosions tearing through his flesh and bone, cracking and rupturing and ripping, until he was dead. Kira stood behind him, gleaming, as Hayato rose from his spell.

“This has happened a thousand times, Hayato. And it will happen a thousand more. You doom anyone who dares find out who I am.”

The sky turned purple. Houses evaporated into a whirlpool. *A time loop.* Hayato chucked Rohan’s earring at the killer, before he himself was lost to time.",2,1771611130.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False
1ra2v1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/micro_saas/comments/1ra2v1g/user_complaints_reveal_a_side_of_apps_nobody/,User Complaints Reveal a Side of Apps Nobody Talks About,"Yes you heard me right! 

Lately I’ve been entertaining myself in a very questionable way.

Reading negative reviews, Not even kidding, it’s more educational than half the startup advice floating around. When users get annoyed enough, they explain exactly what’s broken with absolutely no filter. It’s basically raw product feedback without the corporate sugar coating.

Some repetitive comments that caught my eye were:

**Weather apps are weirdly dramatic for tools that check the Sky.**

you look outside. Perfect sunshine. You check the app. Storm incoming.

Every weather app behaves like it has a flair for suspense. AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, doesn’t matter. Reviews are full of people saying the same thing: How are you this confident and this wrong? Honestly, an app that just admits uncertainty would already feel more trustworthy. Nobody expects psychic powers. Just don’t hallucinate rain.

**Calendar apps love turning simple planning into admin Work**

All you wanted was to note a meeting. Suddenly you’re managing colors, views, settings, reminders, layouts. Google Calendar wins because it’s glued into everything, but using it isn’t exactly a joyful experience. There’s a lot of silent friction in scheduling that nobody talks about. Users don’t want to “manage” time. They just want clarity.

**To do list apps that drives us crazy**

Task apps have a habit of feature spirals. You install it to remember groceries. Next thing you know you’re dealing like that one girl with color coded notes. By the time everything is perfectly organized, you’re too tired to actually do the tasks. There's a reason minimal tools like Todoist keep their user base. Fast entry, low ceremony, done. Complexity is rarely the selling point users think they want.

**Expense trackers that eat us alive Manual**

expense logging always sounds responsible. It also always collapses. Nobody consistently records every coffee purchase like a disciplined finance monk. Apps like Walnut got popular by scraping SMS data because they stopped pretending users would behave perfectly. Good financial tools assume laziness and work with it, not against it.

**Builder tools underestimate how annoying design decisions are**

This one’s funny. Creator tools love advertising freedom. Total control. Infinite customization. In reality, that often means endless tiny decisions. Padding, alignment, spacing, fonts, layouts. It’s mentally draining. A lot of builders would happily trade freedom for sane defaults and structure. That’s why tools like PrettiFlow([https://prettiflow.tech](https://prettiflow.tech/)) are interesting. They lean into components and guardrails so you’re not stuck micromanaging visuals for hours.

Users aren’t begging for futuristic inventions. They mostly want existing categories to stop being irritating. The opportunities are often painfully boring, sitting inside products people already pay for but complain about nonstop. Frustration is a pretty honest signal.

Final verdict to all the startup fellas out there, start solving existing problems rather than trying to search for new problems to solve!!!!.",1,1771611118.0,micro_saas,0,1.0,False

1ra2uha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1ra2uha/autoimmune_thyroiditis_diagnosis_lack_of/,"Autoimmune thyroiditis diagnosis, lack of understanding on the doctors part, despair","Hello.

Somewhere around the beginning of 2025, I started to suffer from severe allergic reactions (5 cases of angioedema in 2025-2026), it seems like I'm allergic to everything, despite the fact that up until that moment everything was great for me, I've never had any allergic reactions (especially to food), except for one (angioedema) when I was in kindergarten (but from then on it never bothered me again until 2025, and then it was an allergy to some vitamins). Now it's gotten so bad that I can literally only eat very runny mashed potatoes or very runny buckwheat because anything else causes my throat to produce mucus, sometimes in such large quantities that it partially blocks my airways, and sometimes I have allergic reactions to food. According to my allergen test results, I have a IgE-mediated allergy to tree pollen, weed pollen, cereal grasses, house dust, dog and cat epithelium (strong sensitization to dog and medium to cat). But then I began to notice that I was allergic even to things that I shouldn’t be allergic to (for example, if you have allergy to birch pollen, you can eat baked apples, but I have a reaction even to baked apples in the form of itching in my eyes). I also had strong reactions to things that I had no reactions to just the day before (I ate pasta bolognese for a week without any problems, and then bam, I got angioedema). But the thing is, antihistamines don't always help me. For example, once I took cetirizine before going to the bathroom, and when I started soaping myself, my whole body turned red and my caruncle on 1 eye swelled . And one more example, before my very first angioedema in 2025, I was taking Suprastin (an antihistamine) (I didn’t know that I had an allergy, but because of the constant mucus in my throat and other symptoms that I mistook for a common cold, I took it just in case along with antiviral drugs because at the time I thought I was just sick, I was taking it for few days in a row), and I still had my first angioedema. But basically, antihistamines help me with some itching, it's just that there are times when the reactions are so strong that they don't seem to work at all.

So, now let's get down to business - I took tests for AT-TPO (thyroid peroxidase antibodies, I just don't know if I wrote the abbreviation correctly in English), TSH, and had an ultrasound of the thyroid gland. According to my test results, my TSH is normal, AT-TPO is 631 (with the norm being 0-9), and according to the ultrasound results, I have signs of chronic thyroiditis (that's what they wrote in the ultrasound results file).

So, I went to the endocrinologist with all this, told her about all these results, and she looked at them on the computer herself. She didn't tell me anything useful. She said that if the TSH (the most important test, according to her words) was normal, then nothing needed to be done. I told her I suspected I might have autoimmune thyroiditis (judging by the results of my AT-TPO and ultrasound). She didn't deny it, but she didn't confirm it either. She and her colleague actually laughed at me loudly. She told me that I was just a ""carrier"" of these antibodies, that they would never go away and nothing could be done about them, and that there was no treatment or monitoring needed for autoimmune thyroiditis. She also said that the thyroid gland cannot be related to allergies. She then saw that my hormones (TSH?) were jumping, in March they were low, in December they were high, now in February they are normal, she (like some other doctors, but they were general practitioners) asked if I was taking hormones, and I once again said no. I don't take any hormones, and this was my very first time in life seeing an endocrinologist (the only hormones I take is hand cream which contains betamethasone, and sometimes I take dexamethasone for angioedema and sometimes for swelling in the eyes). She said that I need to take T3, T4, TSH, and if the hormones are high, then I will be prescribed hormone therapy.

Then I went to see an allergist that same day, she looked at the results of my visit to the endocrinologist on the computer, and she saw that I was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis. She also didn’t tell me anything useful, having heard that for now I can only eat liquid buckwheat and potatoes, she just said it was strange, and told me to continue this diet so as not to provoke reactions, but also to add some meat into my diet. Since she was an allergist-immunologist, I asked her if she knew anything about autoimmune thyroiditis, she said that she only knew superficially, and constantly asked what the endocrinologist told me, she said that if the endocrinologist said so, then it is so.

So... I'm upset about my visits, because apparently there is some way to control this disease? Why then can't anyone prescribe treatment for me? I wanted to ask you guys, is such high allergen activity typical for autoimmune thyroiditis? I've seen posts about how some of you can easily drink coffee, while I only drink water right now, and have strong itching in my eyes from coffee (and this is my favorite drink) :( If I get treatment, my allergy symptoms should be greatly reduced, am I right? I probably should look for more competent doctors, but with everything I've been through, with some doctors not taking me seriously (I remember the male doctor on duty, to whom I told immediately after angioedema that I felt a lump in my throat and it was difficult for me to swallow and difficult to take a breath when I tried to swallow, and he just kept repeating that it was normal, it was post-allergic, that the ambulance had already injected me with dexamethasone and if there was swelling in my throat, it would go away. I was examined by three different doctors at the time, and none of them saw any swelling in my throat, but they only performed superficial examinations and did not conduct a deep examination of the pharynx, laryngopharynx, etc. This condition persisted for 2 days, despite me taking around 15 mg of dexamethasone (first, I put it in my eyes in the form of eye drops, two drops in each eye, after a minute I saw that my eyes were still swollen, I took a 5 mg pill, then the ambulance arrived and injected me with about 4 mg of dexamethasone, and then, since I felt that the symptoms in my throat remained, I went to the clinic and injected myself with about 4 mg more). This was the very first time the symptoms moved to my throat, before I only had severe swelling in my eyes and it never affected other parts of my body), and some even being rude to me (often these were emergency doctors), I'm starting to give up a little.

I'm really tired of my allergies, my diet, and I miss the days when I could eat whatever I wanted. I could easily eat a whole pizza and be just fine, but now I can’t even eat dumplings... The most offending thing is that my birthday is in a week, and I won’t even be able to eat something tasty.

I just need to speak out because it hurts right now. I am F (51). Recently I made the decision to break up with my partner M (52). We were together a little over three years. The surface reason that became the point of no return was his joining Freemasonry.

I know there are many Freemasons on Reddit and some of them may rush into the comments to laugh at the “stupid profane woman.” But please don’t jump to conclusions about my position. My attitude toward Freemasonry is the same as toward religions, sects, political parties, and any closed groups: I look at all of this calmly, critically, and rather skeptically. I prefer neutrality — you don’t interfere in my life, and I don’t interfere in yours. As Mayakovsky wrote: “If stars are lit, it means someone needs them.” In other words, whatever makes people happy — as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.

As a feminist, I actually respect the historical role of some Masonic movements that supported women’s emancipation, divorce rights, contraception, abortion, and basic human freedoms. In that context, I even saw them as allies in the fight for women’s rights. Still, I personally prefer to stay away from any hierarchical structures, including Freemasonry. It goes against my personality, values, and way of living. I tolerate hierarchies only at work because they are unavoidable. In real life, I like my comfort zone and I don’t seek “growth through discomfort.”  
 I say all this just to make it clear that I’m not a conspiracy theorist or a hysterical person.

This story started a year ago, when my ex met a female coworker at his new job and very quickly became close friends with her.

At that time I was working in a hypermarket and at the same time fighting through a professional career change process. I was exhausted physically and mentally. After long hard shifts, I spent nights and weekends preparing documents to convince a commission to approve my reconversion. I was completely burned out.

From the very beginning of our relationship, my partner insisted he wanted a serious, monogamous, “fusion-like” relationship — living together for life, doing everything together, strong emotional closeness, shared interests. From day one he told me: “You are my priority.”  
 Looking back, I probably ignored many red flags. I wanted that closeness so much that I interpreted intensity as love.

We still lived separately for about a year and a half. During that time he was wonderful — caring, affectionate, extremely generous with gifts. During our first year he even “bought me a star” and named it after me.

What amused me a bit was that he immediately told everyone — friends, family — about this star and about all the gifts, restaurants, concerts, shows. He always made sure everyone knew how amazing he was as a boyfriend. People admired him and said how lucky I was.

Something in that bothered me. I told him that I also wanted to feel valued — that it mattered to me that he noticed what I did for him, not only what he did for me. When he praised himself publicly, I felt small, like a rescued princess instead of an equal partner. I wasn’t asking to be saved — I wanted partnership.

He laughed it off and said I was overthinking, that I didn’t know how to receive love, that my problem was that I couldn’t just believe he loved me.

I tried to explain logically: if you love someone, you want to know how to make them happy. My clear “recipe” was simple — recognition, appreciation, hearing “thank you,” feeling seen. Most of the time he took my care as something invisible, like air.

For the record: he never supported me financially. We split expenses fairly, proportional to income. This is not a story about a “gold digger” or ungrateful woman.

Then, after meeting that coworker, he started coming home late every Friday smelling of alcohol. Before that, neither of us drank regularly.

At the same time, he emotionally withdrew from me. He stopped touching me. No affection, no intimacy, no conversations, no time together. He always had excuses — tired, leg hurts, bad weather, no energy.

He had been unemployed for a few months before that job and fell into depression. I felt sorry for him and supported him as much as I could — coffee, small treats, encouragement, suggesting therapy — even though I myself was burned out and barely functioning.

I blamed myself for not being supportive enough.

Then he told me that after work he was going to bars with that female coworker — drinking beer and talking. And he constantly praised her: how brilliant she was, how full of life, how intelligent, how fascinating (she is a scientist and autistic).

It hurt deeply. Not because of sex — there was no physical affair — but because he gave her the emotional admiration I had been asking for.

Later I learned she was a Freemason and recruited him very quickly and in a rushed, almost urgent way, by feeding his ego.

Suddenly he became extremely enthusiastic about joining, despite knowing almost nothing about Freemasonry. That shocked me. It felt reckless and impulsive.

I even suggested visiting the Freemasonry museum in Paris together. He agreed — then forgot completely and refused because he was “lazy.”  
 But when that woman invited him anywhere, suddenly he had energy, no depression, no pain, no bad weather.

At that point I started doubting myself. I thought: maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m really selfish, maybe I’m “suffocating” him and not giving him enough freedom. I genuinely wanted to understand him and support this new chapter of his life. I wanted to share it with him — to go to the museum together with a guide, ask questions, read books, watch documentaries about Freemasonry. I didn’t want to be excluded from his world. I wanted to be close to him.

I even bought him a small wallet with a black-and-white chess pattern as a playful gift. It’s a common Masonic symbol, but also just a simple graphic design. I thought it was a harmless, funny gesture of affection.

His reaction shocked me. He became angry and said I was mocking him, that I was making fun of something serious. He said, “I can’t openly wear Masonic symbols in public — are you making fun of me?”

I tried to explain that it was just a chess-style pattern and that no one in real life connects black-and-white designs with Freemasonry. But he stayed furious.

Later, when other Freemasons told me I should treat Freemasonry like any other hobby — like if my partner had taken up tennis — I always thought about that wallet and his reaction. And I realized: no, this is not the same.

He has other hobbies. For example, he collects Rubik’s cubes. When I bought him new cubes for his collection, he was happy and excited.

So what kind of “hobby” is it where I can’t give a playful gift without triggering rage?

That’s when it became clear to me: this wasn’t a normal interest. The intensity, the anger, the secrecy, the emotional explosions — this didn’t look like tennis or collecting puzzles. It looked much closer to a cult-like dynamic than to a simple pastime.

It became clear: his real interest wasn’t Freemasonry. It was her. He would have joined any group if she invited him.

He would have joined anything — whether it was the Mormons or a Harry Potter fan club. His leg often hurts, and because of that I never pushed him to go hiking with me, even though I enjoy long walks. I tried to be caring and respectful of his limits.

But his “marraine” has a special hobby: exploring the Paris catacombs, which requires long walks underground. And suddenly — what a surprise — he was full of enthusiasm to go with her. His painful leg was no longer a problem at all.

That’s when I fully understood: his limits only existed with me.

When I pointed this out, he gaslighted me — said I imagined everything, that I was too emotional, that he and his “marraine” were rational people on the same wavelength, and that I should be happy for his happiness — otherwise I was selfish.

When I asked about me, about us, he told me to “find hobbies” and stop being attached.

But his hobby wasn’t Freemasonry. His hobby was that woman.

I told him clearly: if he became a Freemason, I would leave. I didn’t agree to live under secrecy rules or censorship about what I could say to friends or family.

When he discovered I had talked to close friends and my sister about the situation, he exploded in rage, screaming that I must keep the secret even from my own sister. I refused.

When I said I would leave, he panicked. Suddenly he became tender again, hugged me (after months of coldness) and promised:  
 “I choose you. You’re my priority. I will stop everything with them.”

I believed him.

One week later, on Friday night, he came home late and announced he was joining Freemasonry anyway and that I couldn’t stop him. He called me controlling, selfish, even mocked me as “a chihuahua barking at a Saint Bernard.”

Later he admitted his “marraine” cried when she learned he had chosen me before — and that pushed him to sacrifice my feelings for hers.

That was when I finally saw reality clearly.

I decided to leave.

While I search for housing, we currently live like roommates. During the breakup logistics, he suddenly demanded to keep my dog. I paid 90% of the puppy, the documents are in my name, I care for him daily. My ex neglects him constantly.

Yet he screamed, threatened me, and tried to force me into signing ownership papers — following advice from his “marraine.”

He never hit me. But his threats and rage create fear and panic.

In the end he pressured me into a “deal”: he would buy me a new puppy if I gave him this one. Out of fear, I agreed.

Now I feel both relief and devastation.

Relief because I cut the emotional bond and chose myself.  
 Devastation because my self-esteem is destroyed. The contrast between being “gifted a star” and being insulted like garbage is hard to process.

I no longer trust my judgment. I don’t trust men — but even more, I don’t trust myself anymore.

I am seeing a therapist.

My questions:

• What are the early signs of a narcissistic manipulator?  
 • Are there clear red flags I should watch for?  
 • What are effective ways to recover mentally and physically after a toxic relationship?

I realized talking was not enough. I had to save myself.

What I didn’t get back then is that being in bed isn’t the same as getting deep sleep and if ur body never drops into real deep slow wave sleep you’ll technically “sleep” but you won’t recover

In my case it was 2 big things: eating too late and staying mentally “on” till the second I tried to sleep

I’d have dinner late sometimes snacks too then scroll on my phone telling myself I’m relaxing but my nervous system was still lit up like it was 2pm not 11pm so my body just hovered in light sleep all night

When I started fixing the timing of my meals (2–3 hrs before bed no heavy sugar late) and actually doing a short wind-down routine no screens just stretching breathing or reading something calm my deep sleep literally changed within weeks

I stopped waking up feeling like I got hit by a truck

Energy felt stable

Less brain fog

Way better mood

I recently read a breakdown explaining why deep sleep gets blocked even when u think ur “doing everything right” and it connected so many dots for me esp the part about stress hormones and how your body won’t switch into deep sleep if it still feels unsafe or stimulated

If ur sleeping 8 hrs but still tired all day don’t just blame yourself or think ur lazy there’s usually a hidden blocker

I'm a 30F who grew up in a somewhat conservative environment. All my friends were virgins until marriage and moved out only to live with their husbands. They’re all happily married and in love.

I also kept my virginity. For a long time, I didn’t really explore sexually. I moved out on my own a few years ago.

It’s hard for me to open up and feel comfortable. I had some sexual experiences on and off with a woman I was deeply in love with for years (it was toxic and nothing happened under the belt), and once with a man but didn’t let him penetrate me because I didn’t know him well and he didn’t have a condom. I don't consider myself a virgin since I did experience sexual intimacy.

Over a month ago, I met a 45F who is bisexual and recently got out of a long marriage. After three dates where we really connected, we got intimate. When she wanted to go in, I stopped her. She then asked if I was a virgin and I said yes, because I knew she meant in terms of penetration.

From the start, she said she wasn’t looking for anything serious and wanted to explore and meet different people. I said I was okay with that. However, after we were intimate, she put her head on my shoulder and said she felt like a child and protected with me. She insisted I stay and sleep over but I declined and she said to not take too long before we see each other again. So in a way, it wasn't strictly casual hookup.

We texted for about a week where I was affectionate, saying can't wait to see you again etc., and she then asked to talk. We met at a coffee shop and she said she’s not looking for anything serious, that I “hid” being a virgin and that it creates a huge gap between us. She said she’s emotionally unstable, hot and cold, rebuilding herself after her marriage, and doesn’t want to feel accountable to someone. She also said she’s not comfortable with affection.

She asked why I kept my virginity this long, and I chose not to explain since we weren’t continuing to see each other.

I feel confused and hurt. I don’t understand why my virginity is being treated like a problem. I want to explore too, I just want to feel safe and comfortable with someone. I was really looking forward to seeing her again because I rarely feel attracted to someone.

It’s now been 5 days of no contact.

Is there anything I can do at this point? Is there any chance she remembers the warmth and comes back? I still think about her a lot and it feels like unfinished business..",1,1771610739.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1ra2lck,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPylori/comments/1ra2lck/hpylori_gastritis/,HPylori & Gastritis,"Hi guys,

I'm wondering if anyone here can help. I am a long term sufferer from this dreaded bug. TLDR: I have been having digestive issues over 2 years, finally found H Pylori in endoscopy, and eradicated it about a year ago. Since then I have had persistent mild gastritis, including mild burning in stomach area and bloating sensation.

Additional details:

* Started with stomach pain 2+ years ago. Prescribed PPIs. 
* Diet at this time was standard vegetarian. Lots of beans, high carb and fat. I don't notice any specific triggers from day to day.
* Breath test for HPy was negative. Prescribed more PPIs. 
* Endoscopy showed HPy and antrum gastritis. Took antibiotics, stool test negative for HPy, prescribed more PPIs.
* Tried probiotics. No change.
* ""Diagnosed"" as bile reflux. Prescribed carafate and cholesterol. No difference. 
* Stomach pain subsided but started feeling more gas. Crazy amounts of gas 24/7.
* Diagnosed last year with NAFLD. Attention shifted to liver and diet. Diet shifted to Mediterranean with some fish. 
* Discovered SIBO about a month ago. Since completing antibiotics gas is greatly reduced but gastritis symptoms remain.
* Stool test still negative for HPy
* Now Dr says ""functional dyspepsia"", only recommendation is low FODMAP.
* Currently taking L Glutamine and Zinc L-Carnosine for stomach rebuild, and artichoke & Ginger for motility.
* Diet is Mediterranean with reduced FODMAP (no sugar, down to 1 cup coffee, no wheat, no beans, minimal milk products, reduced tomato/spicy). 

Any thoughts on where to go from here? Mediterranean diet is already pretty restrictive. Is there any other ""low hanging fruit"" items I can eliminate from the diet?  GI is refusing to recommend any supplements. Betaine looks interesting (I did home baking soda test and got no burp, so suspect low stomach acid is part of the picture).

The office is located in central London and finding a lunchtime table can be hard at times. If a place is busy, it is what it is, no drama. It probably means the place is good. My problem is when diners are busy with people on their laptops, who have probably been there since 9am and bought the cheapest coffee to sit down, eating a sandwich they packed from home and looking at people sideways as they are daring to have a conversation in their offices.

I don't get how a business in a busy area can justify this and refuse to do something about it, especially when I have seen some of these people not even sitting down on a single table/stool, but occupying a table of 4 by themselves so their bags, chargers etc. can be comfortably stored, while people are forced to either take away their food or to go somewhere else.",2,1771610405.0,PetPeeves,10,1.0,False

I started building more relationships with home builders and they always send me construction drawings in order for me to create my bid. I used to print these out at Staples (cost me $50-$100 per plan and a couple hours of my time) in order to do the takeoff. I looked at switching to digital software but most software costs thousands per year (paid upfront) and they all had a steep learning curve and took hours of training to be able to use the software effectively.

since I have a background in software engineering, I decided to make my own tool a few months ago that fit my need. I made it super easy and simple to use and created it so I could use it on a browser so I could swap between my desktop and laptop. I've been improving it ever since and decided to release it completely for free for anyone to use. this is not a sales pitch, there is absolutely nothing you can buy, nowhere to put any card information, this is legitimately free. I developed this myself and it costs me a couple cups of coffee a month to run.

if you're interested in using the tool, it's accessible at [easytakeoffs.com](http://easytakeoffs.com/) for absolutely free. my goal is to help other businesses create bids more efficiently, especially contractors who are not too tech savvy and don't want to spend thousands a year just to be able to create accurate bids.

In this report I made some ""spring cleaning"" updates to the report... I wanted to clean things up, use some simplified formatting and fix a few bugs. All this sets me up for adding more meaningful improvements coming soon to future reports (when I find more time, of course. Anyone have time for sale?!).

Speaking of time, it looks like the Clock Tower Pub scored below norms this week. They seem pretty consistent at that with an average score lower than most places, but they are just a pub maybe (?). I've never been there. Anyone been recently?

That's all I have this time - have a great next week. 🍻

## Scores = 100

These restaurants scored a perfect 100 in their latest inspection, showing a real commitment to food safety.

1ra2dw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/1ra2dw3/business_analyst_not_sure_what_i_realistically/,Business Analyst – not sure what I realistically qualify for. Resume issue or strategy issue?,"Hey everyone,

I’m 24, based in Toronto, and I’m honestly feeling pretty stuck in my job search. I’d really appreciate some advice.

I’ve been working as a Business Analyst at a large telecom company for about 2 years now. Before that I was a BI intern. I also have a CS degree and I’m finishing a part-time MS in Data Analytics.

Here’s my resume 

**EXPERIENCE**

**Large Telecom Company – Toronto, ON**  
*Business Analyst – Operations* | Sep 2024 – Feb 2026

* Owned NPS and escalation performance metrics, driving cross-functional initiatives to improve customer experience
* Owned adoption of an internal AI insights tool, translating user needs into prioritized enhancements, increasing usage from 20% to 82% in two quarters
* Defined and executed NPS strategy by synthesizing customer feedback into digital and process improvements, reducing onboarding escalations by 29% YoY
* Translated stakeholder needs into actionable KPIs and used SQL to automate reporting, saving 5+ hours per week

*Business Analyst – Process Improvement* | Jan 2024 – Sep 2024

* Improved onshore call center SLA, working with Data Engineering to implement new call routing logic, improving SLA by 12% for 4,750+ customers
* Identified fragmentation in fraud call routing and led consolidation from 8 transfer paths to 1, increasing NPS by 7 points
* Identified loyalty call process bottlenecks and translated findings into Jira tickets for system enhancements, reducing AHT across major issue types

*Business Intelligence Intern* | May 2022 – Sep 2022

* Won internal case competition focused on reducing agent attrition and increasing AI adoption
* Used SQL to improve churn model inputs, increasing predictive accuracy by 8%
* Worked with data scientists to assess feasibility and ROI of AI-driven productivity enhancements

**University – Engineering Center (Remote)**  
*Product Analyst Intern* | May 2021 – Sep 2021

* Supported product ownership and analytics for an internal Rasa X chatbot resolving technical issues for 500+ faculty
* Used SQL to analyze chatbot usage and performance, driving \~20% reduction in live chat support inquiries
* Translated conversation insights into feature improvements and partnered with engineers to validate post-release performance



**EDUCATION**

**University (Remote)** – MS, Data Analytics (2026)  
**University (Ontario)** – BS, Computer Science (2019–2023)



**Skills:** SQL, Excel (VLOOKUP, SUMIFS), Python, Jira, Power BI, Confluence, Project Management, Power Automate

  
**Certifications:** CSM



Here’s where I’m confused:

I’ve been applying to:

* Business Analyst roles (ops / strategy / process improvement)
* Strategy Analyst roles
* Product Analyst / Associate PM roles
* Even explored SDR / BDR roles in tech sales because I’m wondering if I should pivot entirely

Long term I was thinking:  
BA → more strategy-focused BA → Senior BA → eventually pivot into Product or Program Management.

But I haven’t had much success landing interviews. I reach out to people on LinkedIn daily for coffee chats , most don’t respond. I even got a referral recently and still haven’t heard anything back.

So I’m trying to figure out:

1. What roles do I realistically qualify for based on this?
2. Is this a resume positioning issue?
3. Am I too “ops-heavy”?
4. Is pivoting to product actually realistic from here?
5. Would SDR/BDR be a bad move or a smart entry into tech?

I don’t think I’m under skilled, but I also don’t know if I’m aiming at the wrong things.

Would really appreciate honest feedback.

1ra2bb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Movetoutah/comments/1ra2bb8/top_8_things_people_moving_to_utah_should/,Top 8 Things People Moving to Utah Should Experience First,"If you’re moving to Utah, don’t just unpack your boxes and go to Costco.

There are a few things you should experience right away so you actually understand why people love living here.

Here’s what I tell most of my out-of-state clients to do in their first few months.

# 1. Drive Up Big Cottonwood Canyon

Before you judge Utah suburbs, go see the mountains up close.

Drive up Big Cottonwood Canyon. Even if you don’t ski. Even if you “aren’t outdoorsy.”

You’ll understand immediately why people choose to live here. The access to real mountain terrain 20 to 30 minutes from neighborhoods is not normal in most states.

This is one of the biggest lifestyle differences in Utah.

# 2. Visit Downtown Salt Lake City

A lot of people assume Utah is all suburbs and nothing else.

Go walk around downtown Salt Lake City. Check out restaurants, coffee shops, local businesses, and events.

It gives you a better feel for the balance between city life and mountain access.

# 3. Experience a Utah Winter Storm

You do not really live in Utah until you’ve experienced:

* A real snowstorm
* Plows running at 3 a.m.
* Neighborhood kids building snow forts

Winter here is part of the culture. Roads are typically cleared quickly along the Wasatch Front, but snow is part of the deal.

If you’re moving from a warm state, this is an adjustment.

# 4. Hike Something Easy With a View

You do not need to summit anything dramatic.

Pick a moderate local trail near Salt Lake County and hike until you get a valley view.

Seeing the entire valley with the mountains behind you helps you understand the geography and why commute patterns matter so much.

Utah living is very tied to terrain.

# 5. Try a Local Utah Restaurant

Utah’s food scene surprises people.

From casual burger spots to higher-end restaurants, there is more variety than outsiders expect.

Trying local restaurants helps you feel connected faster instead of feeling like you are still “visiting.”

# 6. Explore Different Suburbs in Person

If you are buying a home in Salt Lake County, drive multiple cities before you commit.

South Jordan feels different than Draper. Herriman feels different than Sandy. Bluffdale feels different than both.

Online listings do not show:

* Traffic flow
* Neighborhood density
* Noise
* General vibe

Experience it yourself before choosing.

# 7. Take a Weekend Trip to Southern Utah

This is where Utah really separates itself.

Within a few hours, you can be in completely different terrain. Red rock. Desert landscapes. National park level scenery.

Even if you are relocating for work, this part of the state is a huge bonus to living here.

It reminds you why the move made sense.

# 8. Pay Attention to Inversion Season

This one is practical.

During certain winter months, cold air gets trapped in the valley. It is called inversion.

It can affect air quality temporarily. Some areas are impacted more than others depending on elevation.

Understanding this early helps you set realistic expectations.

# Why These Experiences Matter When Moving to Utah

Moving is stressful. It is easy to judge a new state based only on your neighborhood or commute.

Experiencing the mountains, city, winter, and different suburbs gives you a complete picture of Utah life.

Most people who move here and actively explore end up loving it.

Most people who only commute and stay inside their subdivision struggle more.

# Who This Is For

This guide is especially helpful if you are:

* Moving to Salt Lake County
* Relocating from out of state
* Deciding between multiple Utah cities
* Trying to understand the Utah lifestyle

The more intentional you are in your first few months, the faster Utah starts to feel like home.

I’d almost always rather be making art in my home studio than be on a date, but I suppose I could get excited about a extremely rare specimen of a male human. So I’m going to throw these crazy specific criteria out there and see what happens. Probably nothing. But why not? Please don’t judge me too much, I’m not expecting anybody to tick all boxes. And admittedly they’re not boxes for everyone, and that’s all cool.

How about a financially secure professional, above 5’8” with a nose ring! Would love it if he were Persian, Indian, Middle Eastern, African or really any different cultural background from mine, they’re also a feminist, atheist, humanist reader who likes cats and enjoys cooking, and whose mom can be my matriarchal mentor, because I don’t have much of a family of my own.

He does not sweat the small stuff. Not quick to anger. He is direct but gentle, generous, tidy but not a clean freak, dresses thoughtfully. Loyal, very honest, in healthy shape and kinda romantic. Patience may also be important because I have ADHD and am constantly filled with ideas and I constantly forget to drink water. It’s really important to me that we’re close friends and get to know each other slowly. 

Me; I’m an artist, atheist, very independent, apostate - that does form my perspective to an extent, but I’m respectful of others and their voices. I’m a weirdo, non judgmental, well travelled and want to travel with a partner. I’m cute and look/feel/act younger than I am. A financially secure, avid book consumer with particular interest in war history, medicine, religion, science, animals, pathology and more. I will info dump excitedly. I’m morbid, enjoy dark humour and horror movies. I have two friendly cats and a shy eastern box turtle. I love living in down town Vancouver.

It’s always such a fun time! Normally, everyone stays at our house but they opted for an Airbnb closer to the resort this time for ease of travel. I am 29 weeks and no longer feeling comfortable skiing. I have so much FOMO! I know this is just one season out of the many seasons in the future, and of course, I would much rather be pregnant than not pregnant (miscarriage and 2 round of IVF later), but I do feel a little sad/emotional about it. I didn’t think I would feel so sad until it hit me today, the start of the weekend, so it took me by surprise!

I thought about tagging along and not ski, but it seemed silly to pay for an Airbnb when my house is so close, and I have to work today so it’s easier to be at home anyway. I also considered going up for just the evening to hang out, but my sad little car can’t make it through all the snow right now. And apres by myself for most of the day everyday would get boring after a couple of days, so I decided not to go. I’m telling myself it’s just temporary!! And we will have lots of fun ski adventures in the future, it’s just a blip in the grand scheme of things. I just wanted to put it down somewhere so I can be all sad and have my pity party and then let it go and move on lol! Thanks for listening 😂

Here's what actually works, no motivational poster BS.

Most people think respect comes from being loud, aggressive, or ""alpha."" That's cap. Respect comes from **presence, consistency, and how you treat people when there's nothing in it for you.** Let's break down the habits that make people go, ""Damn, there's something different about this person.""

## 1: Master the Art of Listening (Like, Actually Listening)

Most conversations are just two people waiting for their turn to talk. You know it's true. But when someone **actually listens**, it hits different. I'm talking about active listening where you're not thinking about your response while they're mid-sentence.

**The science:** Research from Harvard Business Review shows that people who practice active listening are perceived as more competent and trustworthy. Your brain releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone) when someone gives you genuine attention.

**How to do it:** Maintain eye contact without being creepy. Nod occasionally. Paraphrase what they said before adding your two cents. ""So what you're saying is..."" This simple move makes people feel **heard**, which is rare as hell these days.

**Try the app Ash** for relationship coaching tips that teach you communication skills that actually work in real life. It's like having a therapist in your pocket minus the $200 per session.

## 2: Keep Your Word on Small Stuff

Everyone promises to show up for the big moments. But the person who shows up 5 minutes early for coffee? Who texts back when they say they will? Who remembers that random thing you mentioned weeks ago? That's the person people respect.

**The psychology:** This is called the consistency principle. When your actions match your words repeatedly, people's brains categorize you as reliable. And reliability = respect.

If you say you're going to send that article, send it. If you promise to call back, call back. Don't be the person who ghosts on small commitments then wonders why nobody takes them seriously.

**Habit tracking matters here.** Finch is a solid app for building consistency. It gamifies your daily habits, and honestly, watching that little bird grow because you kept your word to yourself? It transfers to keeping your word to others.

## 3: Control Your Reactions (Emotional Regulation is Sexy)

Nothing screams ""I'm not in control of my life"" louder than someone who loses their shit over minor inconveniences. Traffic jam? Your order got messed up? Someone criticized your work? Cool. Take a breath.

**The research:** A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people who can regulate their emotions are seen as more competent leaders and more trustworthy friends. Your ability to stay calm when everything's on fire tells people you can handle pressure.

This doesn't mean suppressing emotions. It means **choosing your response** instead of reacting like a toddler who dropped their ice cream.

**Resource rec:** Check out **The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk**. This book won multiple awards and van der Kolk is a leading trauma researcher. It's not just about trauma, it's about understanding why your body reacts before your brain catches up. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about emotional control. Insanely good read that teaches you how your nervous system works and how to actually regulate it.

If you want to go deeper on psychology and behavior change but don't have the time to wade through dense research, there's this app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's a personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into customized audio content based on your specific goals. 

You can type something like ""I'm someone who struggles with emotional regulation and want practical strategies to stay calm under pressure"" and it creates a tailored learning plan pulling from psychology resources, neuroscience research, and expert insights. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning way more engaging than reading another self-help book. Makes building these respect-earning habits feel less like work and more like actual progress you can track.

## 4: Admit When You're Wrong (Without Making it Weird)

People who can't admit mistakes are exhausting. You know the type. They'll bend reality into a pretzel rather than say ""my bad.""

**Why it works:** Admitting fault signals confidence. Only insecure people can't own their mistakes. Research from Stanford shows that leaders who admit errors are rated as more trustworthy and competent than those who deny or deflect.

**The move:** ""You're right, I messed that up. Here's how I'll fix it."" Done. No long dramatic apology. No making excuses. Just own it and move forward.

## 5: Speak Less, Say More

Talkers are everywhere. People who speak with intention? Rare. Every word doesn't need commentary. Every silence doesn't need filling.

**The psychology:** Studies show that people who speak less but contribute meaningful insights are perceived as more intelligent and thoughtful. There's literally research on this. Talking just to talk dilutes your credibility.

**Practice this:** Before you speak, ask yourself if what you're about to say adds value. If not, save it. Let someone else fill the silence. You're not a radio that needs to be on 24/7.

## 6: Show Up For People (In Boring Ways)

Grand gestures are cool for Instagram. But respect comes from the unglamorous stuff. Helping your friend move. Bringing soup when someone's sick. Showing up to their kid's recital even though you'd rather be anywhere else.

**Why it matters:** Psychologist Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships shows that it's the small, consistent acts of showing up that build trust and respect, not the occasional big romantic gesture.

Be the person who remembers birthdays without Facebook reminding you. Who checks in when life gets messy. Who offers help before being asked.

## 7: Respect Other People's Time

This one's simple but violating it tanks respect faster than almost anything. Show up when you say you will. Start and end meetings on time. Don't make people wait because you think your time is more valuable.

**The reality:** Being late tells people ""my time matters more than yours."" Even if you don't consciously think that, it's the message received.

Set alarms. Build in buffer time. Respect the clock. People notice.

## 8: Develop Real Skills (Not Just Opinions)

Everyone's got opinions. Hot takes are a dime a dozen on Twitter. But someone who's actually skilled at something? Who's put in hours to master a craft? That commands respect.

**The catch:** You can't fake competence long term. People can smell when you're all talk and no substance.

**Pick something.** Get obsessive about it. Whether it's coding, cooking, writing, building things with your hands, whatever. Deep competence in any domain makes people take you seriously in all domains.

**Read Atomic Habits by James Clear** if you want to actually build skills instead of just thinking about building skills. Clear breaks down the science of habit formation better than anyone. This bestseller has sold millions of copies because it actually works. It's the best habit-building book I've ever read and will rewire how you think about skill development.

## 9: Stop Complaining (Seriously, Just Stop)

Chronic complainers are respect repellents. Everyone's life is hard. Everyone's dealing with stuff. The person who faces challenges without making it everyone else's problem? That's who people want to be around.

**The neuroscience:** Complaining literally rewires your brain for negativity. Stanford research shows that complaining shrinks the hippocampus, the part of your brain responsible for problem-solving. You're making yourself dumber and less likeable simultaneously.

**Alternative:** If something's wrong, either fix it or accept it. Those are your only two real options.

## 10: Give Credit, Take Blame

When things go right, shine the spotlight on others. When things go wrong, step up and own it even if it wasn't entirely your fault.

**Why this works:** Research on leadership shows that people who deflect praise and absorb criticism are universally respected. It signals security, team orientation, and maturity.

This is counterintuitive because ego wants the opposite. But that's exactly why it's powerful. You're going against the grain of human selfishness.

---

Look, none of this is rocket science. But most people won't do it because it requires **consistency over flash**. Respect isn't built in a day. It's built in a thousand small moments where you chose to be reliable, honest, calm, and present.

1ra21ld,https://i.redd.it/hyp4lak4sokg1.jpeg,Day 23,"The power of coffee. The magical nature of the hot bean juice. It is something to take awe upon. Now coffee has been around for awhile now, but I would say more so than ever, it is the drug of choice for most of the world. Some would even give me crap for calling it a drug, but caffeine is one heck of a substance. I vividly remember back in the day when I abused caffeine I would have a caffeine hangover for days when I got off of it. So no, I don't think I am underselling caffeine whatsoever. 

Caffeine, oh caffeine, what a wonder drug you are. I use it to power through sleepiness spells and drink one on the way to work. Now it is my first power drink of the day, besides water. The power of it was stupendous, waking you up like nobody’s business. Keeping you going and going like an energizer bunny. 

This coffee cup though is empty, already drunk, already consumed, none of that liquid ambrosia left for the mortal eye to see, just the dregs remain. The dregs of coffee, the dregs of an empire that took to get that coffee into that cup. 

It’s something people don’t think about often, but imagine the supply chain, the picking, the machines, the amount of work it takes to get coffee from the plantation to your cup. And look at the price. It is an effort that takes an empire to do but we look at it so simply. Especially those who like their coffee already baked and ground for them, oh boy, that is even two more steps of complexity to the process but look at that price. 

Coffee is a multinational affair but somehow through the rules of commerce, we have achieved it for less than a dollar for the cup. Cents! It is madness when you think too hard about it, but I think about these topics way too much and get astounded by the miraculous nature of civilization too often. 

And I am only talking about pure coffee, let alone the creamer, the sugar, the milk, etc. all the accessories, taking up their own supply line with thousands of individuals involved just so that you can add milliliters of liquid and/or a gram of solids to your coffee. Magical isn’t it? 

A miracle some would say, a bloody miracle of human ingenuity to make coffee so accessible and so attainable. But I would say that about the grocery store in general and I will gush about it. It is one of the most amazing inventions of human kind, the grocery store. A cornucopia of indulgence and wealth, all at rock bottom prices. 

The fact that you can get so many different vegetables, fruits, fish, meats, all from so many different sources and countries. All picked and ready to eat when you pick them up, with all the rejects automatically sorted. It is a miracle of engineering, marketing, science, and so many other disciplines working all together to make the mad machine of daily life keep on grinding. 

And maybe that is the topic of today, the daily grind. The grindset, mindset. The everyday monotony is something to be proud of. Can you imagine the daily life before we had the white collar/blue collar divide? Before we had industries and companies bearing the weight of our economy. Back in the day when almost everyone use to be some kind of farmer? Those kind of back breaking days. 

Versus today in modernity, we are yes, some would say soul sucking cubicles. But there’s A/C, coffee, a comfortable chair, internet, no back breaking work for the average American. Isn’t that the definition of wealth beyond you can imagine. Like imagine back in the ye old times, back when castles were the end all be all. What amenities does a castle have? Perhaps a working plumbing system, maybe. But what about A/C, wifi, smokeless lights, so much more that we take for granted in the modern era. 

Yes, there are problems. The affordability crisis, and so much more is ridiculous. But on a macro scale, we are doing pretty amazingly, swimmingly, when so much of America’s industries revolve around poking around an excel sheet for half the day and then goofing off for the other half. Isn’t it magical? Stupendous even? Maybe I am a water half full kind of guy, but it feels pretty magical that we have so many inventions that are inspired by sci-fi. 

Look at our cell-phones. I remember when it was magical that you could dial long distance without the need of a calling card. Remember those days when you had to buy a calling card? Or am I dating myself as an unc right now. Either way, technology has moved so fast in so little time and yes we still have some of the same troubles as previous generations. But at least we have new problems to deal with. 

Like perhaps call me an optimist, but today is an optimistic sort of day for me, where I am trying to look at the bright side of humanity. And I am always trying to do that because its quite easy to tear things down. Actually it is much easier to destroy than it is to create. Hence, here I am trying to create something every day. And rather than succumb to the easy points of criticism, I am pushing for optimism, for hope. 

And I would say that coffee is one of the symbols for hope. It is one example of human’s ingenuity in conquering so many barriers that we have coffee in abundance. We live in a society full of abundance in so many different ways. And yes some parts of it is fading, but that doesn’t mean we should not look our gifts and not relish what we have. You can chew bubble gum and walk at the same time. We can find faults in our world while we appreciate that we are living on top of giants.

Well, right before we became official, she revealed to me she had been sleeping with a guy for the last 6 months and never told me.  This messed with my head a lot but I powered through telling myself she was choosing me in the end and life would go on.  Well, it haunted me month after month and one night in an argument, she told me i should find another girl who better suits me. 

In my frustration, i walked the mall and discovered a very cute, very young girl standing alone.  We got to talking, shared coffee, i lied and said i was single.  She seemed so wonderful and innocent, someone who would ground me back to a reality where joy is part of my life again.  It was true, we began dating and it was truly wonderful and I could not give it up.  My other relationship i wanted to break off and assumed it would be no issue to do so.  

Over time, both relationships became routine and part of my life.  I'll tell you about each one and what the relationship has been like the past 2 years.  

The medical student who is now a doctor is a very serious person, all business.  Gets things done, comes from a very wealthy California family and has that princess attitude.  She does not want gifts, insists to pay for her own meals on dates, has her own car, very independent.  She's probably not the prettiest person on earth, passable, very short which is not my preference but i'm extremely emotionally attached since the day we met in highschool.  Typically our attempts to go out on dates end in arguments because she often does something to ruin it.  our time together at home is different, she'll cook some good food, we'll watch a movie and almost always have amazing conversations.  She's loves to paint, she loves  her plants and garden outside which she obsesses over and i support, she loves her family and her family is very involved in her life.  A life of studying for medical school has left her with little stamina so physical intimacy is often short and unfulfilling.  In fact she has almost zero interest in intimacy and i think i am her 5th boyfriend  
  
The younger girl from the mall could be a model.  She's studying Finances and is currently in her second year.  She is almost as tall as me and meets every preference i could ever want.  She doesn't work or have her own money and comes from a poor family.  When we're together or go out on a date, i'm paying for everything.  She does want gifts, nice ones, does not have her own car, is very emotionally dependent on me which is fine but she's clearly still very immature.  She gets hurt easily so i'm very careful around her feelings.  She often misunderstands something I say and makes drama forcing me to spend time calming her down, getting her to talk, figuring it out and then convincing her it's just a misunderstanding.  it gets exhausting.  We do not have deep or meaningful conversations but she does play video games with me  I'm her first boyfriend which also makes me her first experience with physical intimacy.  It's...well it's everything ever guy could dream of as far as intimacy goes.  She has no interests or passions in life, she's still figuring everything out. Unless you count putting on makeup and making herself look gorgeous 24/7 

For me, i'm not interested in 2 girlfriends, never was.  I just feel annoyed all the time at how girls act and feel like i can't be happy with anyone.  my highest priority in life is getting married and having kids.  A younger girl is better suited to having children but a doctor from a well off family suits my own background.  I'm extremely deeply attached to the doctor who i've known for many years.  The younger girl i've known for only 2 years and we have such a more vibrant, youthful relationship.  It lacks the intellectual depth of my other relationship with the doctor and i hate the financial difference of our backgrounds

There's too much to write.  The doctors family, her mother for example, they are people I cannot stand but we all get along and they love me.  The younger girls family is quite normal except her father who is a loser and no one talks to him.  I have chosen to take a break, i took a plane somewhere for a trip to be by myself for awhile.  I've got both girls constantly messaging and calling to talk and want pictures.  I'm managing it just fine but you can understand how wrong this is and that something needs to change.  I'm hiding out in Utah right now while both girls reside in the same city withing the same couple miles of each other.  Please give input, ask questions, i cannot sleep.

Not a sponsored post, not a press sample. We bought this unit at retail and a January ice storm across Mason County in Northern Michigan gave us an unplanned 90-hour test starting at 11 PM on a Thursday.



What we ran off it the entire time:



240V well pump (1HP) — confirmed, no trip

Full-size fridge + chest freezer — continuous, zero food loss

Propane furnace blower (600W)

Two laptops, monitors, mesh network — continuous remote work

CPAP with humidifier — zero interruption overnight

Electric kettle, coffee maker, phone/tablet/camera charging

Smart home hub + security cameras



The thing that actually matters: This is the only portable power station we've tested with true 120V/240V dual output. Every other unit — EcoFlow, BLUETTI, other Jackery models — outputs 120V only. That means your well pump, electric dryer, water heater and range are dead in an outage with those units regardless of their capacity.



The 0ms UPS is real: We had an active video call running when the grid failed. It continued without interruption. No reboot, no flicker, nothing.



What we didn't love: It's heavy and expensive. This is a semi-permanent home system, not a camping power bank. If you need portability, look elsewhere.

Since the weather is being... well, very ""Texas"" today, I figured I'd drop a list of the best indoor spots to burn off that toddler (or teen) energy without everyone losing their minds at home.

# 1. For the ""I Need to Run"" Energy (Active Play)

* **KidMania (Plano/Fort Worth):** It’s basically a 5-story maze of tubes and slides. Great for older kids who need to disappear for two hours while you grab a coffee in the ""No Kids Allowed"" parent lounge.
* **Bolder Adventure Park (Grand Prairie):** This place is massive (66k sq ft). They have rock climbing, zip lines, and even synthetic ice skating.
* **Epic Waters (Grand Prairie):** If you want to lean into the water theme, this indoor waterpark is elite. The retractable roof stays closed when it’s raining, but the slides are still 10/10.
* **Urban Air / Altitude:** You can find these everywhere, but they are a lifesaver for trampoline-based exhaustion.

# 2. For the Mini-Explorers (Toddlers & Pre-K)

* **Play Street Museum (Multiple Locations):** Best for the 8-and-under crowd. Each location has a different theme (Great Outdoors, Town Square, etc.). It’s manageable and doesn't feel overwhelming.
* **Peppa Pig World of Play (Grapevine Mills):** If your kid is in their Peppa era, this is a no-brainer. Plus, it’s right next to **SEA LIFE Aquarium** and **LEGOLAND Discovery Center**.
* **Crayola Experience (Plano):** Hands-on art stations and a two-story ""Color Playground.""

# 3. Brain Power (Museums & Science)

* **Perot Museum (Dallas):** The Moody Family Children’s Museum on the bottom floor is perfect for little ones, while the dinosaur skeletons upstairs never get old.
* **Fort Worth Museum of Science and History:** They just remodeled the **TCU Children’s Gallery** (reopening March 7th, but plenty of other stuff is open now!).
* **Frontiers of Flight Museum (Dallas Love Field):** Great for kids who love planes. There’s a dedicated play area inside where they can ""fly"" their own missions.

# 4. Cheap or Free-ish Options

* **NorthPark Center (Dallas):** Specifically **The Play Place**. It’s free, though you’ll probably end up spending money on Auntie Anne’s or Disney Store gear nearby.
* **Dallas Museum of Art (DMA):** General admission is free! Their Center for Creative Connections is very kid-friendly and a great way to sneak in some culture.
* **Local Libraries:** Many DFW libraries (like Frisco or Southlake) have incredible indoor play areas and story times.

**Pro-Tip:** If you’re heading to Grapevine Mills or any of the big museums on a rainy Saturday, **book your tickets online** before you leave the house. They *will* sell out or have long lines.

Good point- my operation took 55 mins, I got video, my mother is allowed to stand in the OT, they also do video call to my father in Abu Dhabi from OT, it’s a great experience for my mother. She was also asked for coffee in the OT, I am told she loved the coffee. Dr Jay Mehta took personal care of my mother.

1ra1uum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALSorNOT/comments/1ra1uum/mom_died_of_als_20_years_ago_and_now_i_have_all/,Mom died of ALS 20 years ago and now I have all body twitching.,"Been following this group recently as the last 3-4 weeks or more so I have been experiencing all over body muscle twitching. I am 67. 

A bit of history- My mom died of ALS st 72 ( no other family history) and I unfortunately had a front row seat to the disease. I remember being at her apartment helping her with a dinner party and seeing bruises and even a burn on her arms. She brushed me away, but later sitting down in living room I saw fluttering in her lower arm that was pretty constant. I even put my hand on it to stop it and it wouldn’t. I knew something was wrong. Full body weakness followed pretty fast, but for sure she was experiencing it then as the bruises showed. The persistent fluttering under her skin is what really freaked me out at the time and here I am!

Because of my family history I went to a neuro ( more than once) and a few years ago for a twitching thumb which he kindly told me was not ALS but he tested my arms and legs on his emt machine to make me feel better. Turns out I have neuropathy in my feet and calves probably due to having a form of Marie Charcot tooth ( a milder neuro disease in my family - lucky me) which is very slow moving. Checked back 5 years later and no change to progression which was great. I also have chronic vertigo which was diagnosed 30 years ago and won’t bore you with that. 

Now 3 years later I have suddenly start having muscle twitching. I always have issues with my feet - cramping, buzzing etc but never muscle twitching anywhere until now. (Marie Charcot Tooth only affects lower legs and hands. ) But the twitching Started with upper thigh, eye, and a week later was in both arms, back and even stomach. I won’t be able to see neuro for at least 6 months if lucky. And because I already have crappy balance, and neuropathy in my feet it’s hard for me to see if I have any weakness that is newly apparent. AND, of course I’m totally paranoid and freaked out already because of my mom. Twitching has been going on for about a month now that I can tell. I am pretty healthy overall, swim a mile 3x a week etc but was down with a flu the last month and laying about a lot. That’s when I really took notice of the muscle twitching. 

I’ve started taking Vit B and cutting down my coffee in hopes that this is benign fluttering. I’m also wondering if anxiety is playing into the symptoms! I am unable to distinguish any new muscle weakness  but also just recovering from a flu. 

Bottom line, I’m trying to figure out if  the speed of the fluttering and the jumping from side to side of my body ( progressed in 4 weeks or so) and locations - opposite arms legs back) might actually mean that this is not ALS?! I am reading contradictory info on how the twitching manifests ( one area at a time or multiple locations ) and with what speed. Grasping at straws now! Does a 4 week timeline of  twitching in one thigh to full body - upper lower sound unlikely? Or possibly. It’s a dark hole, this disease. Praying daily. ",3,1771608931.0,ALSorNOT,9,1.0,False

1ra1tia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1ra1tia/how_do_you_know_when_its_time/,How do you know when it’s time?,"31(m)

We got married after only knowing each other for a few months because I was in the Army. I was 21, she was 19, and the first year of marriage was really rough. When I got out of the Army things got better, felt like we developed a genuine connection and love. We moved, travelled, and I was planning on spending the rest of my life with her. 

Then 6 years in, during a patch where I had to work more in order to pay bills while she in between position, she cheated on me. I found texts in her phone of her blowing random guys in parking lots, going over guys house after she drops off coffee to me at work, and even when our power went out for a few days after a storm she lied and went over to guys house while I was at home. At the time I was destroyed, I confronted her, attempted to get her to tell the truth but she kept lying. After a few days of talking things out, I thought we figured it out and we could move past it. She claimed it was because she was going through body dysmorphia and she needed the validation from other men. I tried to be more attentive and communicate with her more.

A few months later I found out that she hadn’t stopped cheating, only got better at hiding it so we decided that we needed a break and she should take a position overseas for a few months while we reevaluate. Only a month or so into her leaving her Moms battle with cancer took a turn for the worse. We both end up going to her mom’s home and living there as a caretaker for about a month during the end of her mom’s life. During this time she cried, sincerely apologized for cheating again and again, and stated that she couldn’t have gone through that alone and she wants to start over so we can be together. Of course I agreed thinking we can finally move on.

After the funeral for her mom she resumed her overseas assignment and this time she would be gone for 6 months. This eventually turned into a year and I thought when she got home we can finally get back to being in a loving relationship. We talked constantly when she was away about what we wanted to do when we saw each other and how excited we were to be together. When she returned however she didn’t like my haircut or the way I looked and because she’s been gone for so long she didn’t want a lot of sex so we were barely having intercourse. I found out about a month into her being home that she was sleeping with someone while overseas, for how long and what they did is still a mystery. She was still communicating with the guy and even planned on seeing him. I confronted her, she claimed it was nothing, and asked for us to move on because she wanted to be with me. 

Now we have passed 10 years together and she took another assignment overseas for a few months. When the opportunity came up I asked her to take it because I was feeling like we’ve been distant, not really being intimate, having some serious fight where she has said awful stuff to me, and that I needed the space. She was hesitant to go but then a few days later she made the decision to go and was very excited about it. I have suspicions that she is cheating with another coworker or someone she has met through work again and that is why her decision changed (3 of the 6 guys that I know of were coworkers). 

Now that she is gone and all that we have been through, idk if I want her to come back. She makes 3 times as much as me because we’ve moved a lot for her position. I don’t think it’s best for my mental health to stay with her but at the same time idk what to do.

anyone have thoughts on what to do?

Victoria was super friendly throughout the custom planning process. Her form makes it easy to plan out what you want, and then she'll discuss it with you to make sure it's all good. I also like that I could upload my own label design- they're fun to make and I'm pleased with how it turned out.

My custom is Gregory Edgeworth - based off an (admittedly minor) character from Ace Attorney. I might possibly be the only person ever to think of this as a slime theme. However I do want more AA slimes now. I called the scent ""bookstore"" as I chose the library scent as the base, and Victoria offered to add a hint of coffee to add to the atmosphere. I think it turned out really nicely; it has a sort of mature and familiar atmospheric quality. Which fits the character nicely. The texture is butter pumice, which I'm in love with. It's dense but squishy, both smooth and lightly gritty. Absolutely what I wanted.

Considering how much creative input you have, Retriever's customs are a great value and I totally recommend ordering from her form. I'd love to get more in the future.

I decided to also get Pengu Popcorn while I was at it, because I do love both penguins and popcorn. It's very cute, with the fimos and charms. I really enjoy perlite slimes, and this one has a lovely texture and asmr-y quality to it. The scent is buttery and sweet, although admittedly I have no idea what the ""jack frost"" note is supposed to be.

# My mom abused me. A lot.

I’ve never admitted this fully publicly before but it’s time.

My mom committed covert incest with me. Possibly stuff that’s more overt depending on how you define it, I don’t know.

My mom is a covert/vulnerable narcissist. (My father is a grandiose narcissist.)

Growing up my mom did a lot that was not okay.

She’d reward me for dissociating (I had PTSD and dissociated a lot as a child due to physical abuse at school and at home as well as CSA) and then play games roleplaying where we were best friends or sometimes dating.

She kept this up until I was in high school and when confronted said it was my idea because I wanted to dissociate so she was just doing me a favor. She would encourage this until it got too sexual and then would say they were my idea and punish me as being disgusting (I was a minor, dissociated, and a survivor of CSA since 8 years old (not by her but she knew about it.))

I don’t want to get into all the moments things crossed the line. There were many. Some examples include her showing me R rated movies as a kid (my dad also did this), minimizing my sexual assault by saying I ‘didn’t get rape raped so I should get over it’, forcing me to listen to her tell fetishistic stories that embarrassed me while i asked her to stop repeatedly etc.

While it is true she never touched me overtly sexually there were so many moments that were traumatic and awful.

She made the necessary application of medication to the genital area very weird as a small child forcing me into weird positions to do it despite my protests. She also did it inconsistently allowing me to endure a UTI for months at one point without medial care.

Due to PTSD after being molested (not by family) I went through a brief period where I deskilled and forgot how to clean myself properly after using the toilet and she would insist on doing it despite me being 8 or 9, instead of taking me to a doctor to figure out why. She would again force me into really triggering abuse adjacent positions to do this. She constantly infantilized me and for a while said I couldn’t put my underwear on right or things like that and had to show her when I was older than that was appropriate.

She snooped and found my sex toys and shamed me for them as a teen - she was just constantly telling me I was disgusting for having a sexuality at all. She also verbally interrogated me for MANY hours without breaks once until she extracted what one of my kinks is and then proceeded to shame me about it for years.

The shame discourse was always woven through it so deeply and completely as to give me a complex (religious based - I was gay (well bi but I ‘read’ as gay to people) and she hated this though in public claims to be the world’s most progressive supportive mom.) in public she realized she’d be more popular if she played the role of supportive ally mom. In private she was awful.

When I was in my teens I confronted her. I said (without knowing all the right terms) that she made me feel like an incest victim. Normally when I confronted her of the physical or emotional abuse she did she denies denies denies. This was different. She looked panicked and turned very pale and covered her mouth with her hand and just shook violently. Then she pretended it never happened but kept a copy of the letter where I accused her on our coffee table like a threat for months. Like as if by flaunting it she was proving no one will ever believe me. It’s the only time in all my life she has ever reacted like that.

But as I became an adult and moved out the sexual aspect of the abuse went away. I stupidly assumed she had changed.

A couple years ago I had medical issues requiring a series of surgeries and she became my caregiver because I had no one else (and I don’t trust my dad because he had a greater history of being physically violent) and one of the things I wanted was a privacy screen.

She wouldn’t allow it. She and my dad pushed back on it but it was led by her because he doesn’t care. I gave in despite my boundaries. I don’t know why I didn’t fight harder but at that point she’d already rehospitalized me twice as I was recovering due to abuse, had repeatedly physically assaulted me as punishment for being ‘demanding’ (I asked her not to reuse dirty bandages on me etc. and I’d asked her for help in the restroom and she would either not clean me at all or make me have to literally beg to be cleaned and not sit in my own waste.)

I had no other caregivers and I was dependent due to illness so I took the path of least resistance and didn’t lobby harder for a privacy screen.

So for about two months I had to be in plain view naked. As a grown man. It was humiliation it was horror. I developed wound healing issues. I was so stressed they wouldn’t close which meant even longer spent as an invalid. (As soon as I moved back to my own home they healed within 2 weeks).

I dissociated again.

It was like I was a kid again and it all came back.

And when I was limping to the restroom at one point she saw I passed by the window (I didn’t even notice I was so dissociated at that point) and said I was disgusting to be putting my naked body where people would peep in and see me. The humiliation and shame and cruelty of it broke me.

At the time I didn’t process it. It’s only now I’ve had a year and a half of distance to process it that I realize how violated I felt. Because it all came back. Because she told me I was being dramatic and using ‘old news as an excuse’ because I said my PTSD from CSA made it difficult to be cleaned and handled and left naked. Because she heard me say no and stop and harmed me over and over and over again.

In public she tells everyone how great a mother she is for caring for me during my ill health.

In private I felt like I was a child again.

# So no more denial.

The latest thing by comparison is very mild but in some weird attempt to show she accepts me she sent me an email of softcore erotic photography of a male celebrity. Unprompted and unsolicited of course. She didn’t tag it as nsfw and it opened to just like a macro of this guy’s ass in underwear - just totally inappropriate.

I can’t even fathom it. I just deleted it. But it showed me how absolutely warped her sense of what’s okay is.

I’m done making excuses for her. I’m done defending her.

What she did to me was something I’d call abuse if it happened to anyone else.

So I’m not lying to myself anymore.

Thank you for witnessing/reading this I’m sorry it is so long, anyone who has made it this far.

I appreciate anyone who took the time to hear this.

Thank you.",1,1771608426.0,CovertIncest,1,1.0,False
1ra1lnu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ra1lnu,Have you visited the bardo yet?,"Now **open daily from 7AM to 2PM** at the glass building Downtown (**313 2nd St SE**)! Brought to life by the incredible [Beatrix Ost](https://www.instagram.com/beatrixost), Charlottesville's newest opening is more than a cafe -- it's a masterpiece. Enjoy coffee and baked goods from Cumbre while you take in Beatrix's artwork. Her paintings, sculptures, and mixed-media works are exhibited exclusively throughout the bardo and encourage reflection, imagination, and creative openness. Everything on display is also available for private acquisition! We reached out to the bardo's curator and managing director, Syris, for a quick Q&A -- below ⬇️

1. **Why did you choose Charlottesville for The Bardo?**
   1. Beatrix Ost found a farm (Estouteville) here in 1980, coming from New York City but being from Germany. As such, she has predominantly lived here since then. So, the Bardo is the opening up to the public and the continuation of an extraordinarily creative life and career that’s spanned fashion, film, and fine art.
2. **Could you speak more about your partnership with Cumbre?**
   1. First came the idea of her gallery to display the loads of art and sculpture she has in her portfolio, ignited by her son Oliver Kuttner's idea to open up the space in the Glass Building. Then, after going to Cumbre, she was taken by the service and culture, so they asked if they would be interested in opening up a cafe inside which would bring a constant flow of people to explore and experience Beatrix's art. The cafe works perfectly, as in European and Argentinian culture, coffee is a break in the day where you sit down, have a cup, and relax. We are not hoping it fits into daily life... it is a place that encapsulates the absolute best of what Charlottesville has to offer.
3. **What is the backstory/meaning of your name?**
   1. The ""Bardo"" is a word to describe liminality and the in between. Our tagline is ""Be in the In Between."" And in Beatrix's words, *""The bardo reminds us of the irreplaceability of time. It is always different and never repeating itself. In the bardo is where you feel the preciousness of time and confront yourself with it. Nobody can escape it. However, when you are in the bardo, surrounded by a wonderland of art and expression, you can find yourself in there.""* This is true for our gallery-café and what the word 'bardo' means."" She chose this name for the space because she knows how precious it is to have a place to gather and be aware of something that reaches beyond the day-to-day and connects us to the deeper truths that live within each of us.
4. **How can customers come in and best experience your space?**
   1. Customers are encouraged to get a cup of coffee, an empanada, and a treat, and sit and observe how the gallery is woven together to inspire a novelty within. After touring both floors of the gallery and finishing their food/drink, go into the Silent Room to truly discover what the bardo is really about.
5. **What item do you think new customers should try first?**
   1. We have a host of products for customers, most notably prints of her most notable art pieces so people can take own some of her artwork, special edition postcards, books, even the famous face/dog/cat candles are for sale, and eventually we will have tote bags, stickers, coffee cups, etc.
6. **What’s YOUR favorite item?**
   1. For Beatrix—a latte and the breakfast empanada.
7. **What is your vision for The Bardo? Any future goals?**
   1. In the 'Silent Room' upstairs, where there is no phone, no food, no drinks, no conversation, just people being with themselves... we will eventually be running a weekly (or bi-weekly) event called 'Soup and Silence' where people who book online will receive a bowl of soup and 1 hour of silence, led by either/both Beatrix and myself.
   2. We also will be renting the space in the afternoons/evenings for private events.
   3. We will also host musical performances, poetry readings, Jeffersonian talks, etc. and with nice weather, host bands and musicians outside for ticketed musical shows.
   4. We see it easily becoming the best place in town, morning day and night, for artistic and creative gathering for all types of people.
8. **Is there anything else you’d like the public to know about you?**
   1. Everyone who walks through the door is in awe and filled with wonder. It simultaneously makes people fall silent in contemplation and also exclaim aloud with joy and enthusiasm. It is everything and more than you could hope art does for people. Instead of it being displayed in an isolated way like in a museum, it's woven together based on how we felt inspired. So, people get to experience fine art in this extraordinary way. It's both accessible but exclusive.
9. **What elements or takeaways do you hope shine through to the Charlottesville community?**
   1. That people discover themselves as an artist, truth-seeker, listener, and freely-expressive human being, doing so specifically in service and benefit of others. The Bardo is about community, outreach, and togetherness, which we need more of in our seemingly separate and isolated lives. It offers harmony and breaks the illusion of separation and gives people an opportunity to discover who they really are.",0,1771608369.0,Charlottesville,37,0.46,False

**November 8th, 2025**

I don’t really know where to start with all of this, so I guess I’ll just start from the very beginning and hope that this somehow makes sense.

My name is Jonathan. I’m 24 years old, which I know isn’t that old to most people, but it sure feels like it sometimes. I was born in 2001 in an unremarkable medium-sized city in the Midwest. Let’s just say this city has seen better days. What was once a major industrial employer has since been turned into a shell of what it used to be. Most of the major companies closed their factories down, and the few that remained open could never get enough workers due to a years-long population decline. The city entered a financial recession, which to this day it hasn’t fully recovered from, despite new attempts at bringing in modernized industry.

Still, a lot of the old-timers who lived to experience this city’s economic boom wanted to keep the glory days alive, I guess. Them, and those who never had a chance in life. I mean, that’s my only explanation as to why those factories stayed open: clinging on to relics of the past. One of those people was my own father. He was, let’s just say, most people’s idea of what a stereotypical blue-collar worker was. One of those pickup-truck-driving, beer-drinking types who didn’t believe in higher education, claiming that you had to get your hands dirty to be a “real man” and that college was just a scam.

Right off the bat, our relationship was less than ideal. Trust me, you did not want to ever get on his bad side, or else all hell would break loose. I’m sure the death of my mother didn’t do any good for his mental state. That’s why, despite his anger problems, he got full custody of me right from the start. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he was severely depressed on top of it all. I mean, how could he not be? Slaving away at the same factory your whole life, watching any opportunity you had to make something of your life slowly slip away. Even from a young age, I knew that I didn’t want that kind of life.

The problem was that I never really knew what I actually did want. As a kid, I felt completely aimless. I was quiet, shy, the kind of kid everyone else pays extra attention to. This made me a prime target for bullies, who would physically and emotionally torment me every chance they got. I honestly just accepted it. I knew I wasn’t normal. I was a weird kid with no mother and a father who I was honestly afraid of most of the time.

Most days when I got home from school, I’d find my father sitting on the couch in the living room in front of the TV, watching either news reports or some college football game, exhausted from having worked all day. I never said much to him, and he never said much in return. I would spend the rest of the day in my cramped bedroom, either doing homework or escaping into one of my video games, the colourful images and cute characters distracting me from the torment I faced in the real world. When bedtime came around, I’d just lie awake staring out the small window next to my bed at the decrepit old houses out on the cracked street in front of our place, hoping that I would find any sort of direction someday.

Things continued like this for a long time. My father never gave up his tough-guy attitude, and I kept on being the social outcast at school. Honestly, I don’t remember much from that period of my life. What I do remember, though, is the day I thought everything was going to change. It was March 21st, 2016. I was a freshman in high school, still 14 at the time, and it had just been another run-of-the-mill day for me. At 1 p.m., a dozen other kids and I settled into our science class. Our teacher told us that we’d be starting on the biology unit that day and put on a nature documentary for us to watch.

Seriously, I still remember this moment like it was yesterday. The documentary opened on the most beautiful-looking scenery I had ever seen. Deep blue skies and lush green forest as far as you could see, broken up by majestic-looking mountains in the background. The narrator of the documentary stated that we were currently looking at the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. I was entranced by the beauty I was seeing. The scene then switched to a shot of a cat moving slowly through the forest below. The narrator described the scene: a female cougar stalking a lonesome deer, looking for her next meal.

The cougar moved so quietly, barely making a sound as she prepared herself for the kill, and I’ll admit I was silently cheering her on. Suddenly, it jumped up, and the deer had no time to react before it was quickly taken down and suffocated by the large cat. I watched in complete awe as the cougar proceeded to drag the dead deer a short distance to a small area of densely packed trees.

What happened next is the part I remember the most about it all. The cougar let go of the deer and turned her head towards a small bush a few feet away. She meowed quietly, and out from behind the bush emerged several kittens — her babies. The mother cougar returned to the deer carcass, and her cubs ran after her, bouncing along the soft ground and over the exposed tree roots lining the forest floor. I vividly remember feeling my eyes go wide as I watched the kittens bumping into each other as they bounded towards their food, innocent as anything. It took everything in me not to scream. It was the cutest thing I’d ever seen.

I don’t really remember what happened after that; it all felt like a blur to me. I had so many emotions running through my mind, all from a simple documentary, but something changed in me that day. Seeing those kittens ignited something in me, and for the first time in my life, I no longer felt aimless. To this day, I’m amazed at how quickly all of this happened, but I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. After so many years of wandering aimlessly, I finally had an answer. I wanted to work with animals. I wanted to live in the Pacific Northwest, far away from the industrial wasteland that I was so familiar with. I had finally found my calling, and by God, I was going to do whatever I could to make my new dream a reality.

For the next few months, I was on top of the world. Every night, I’d spend my time researching various canine and feline species, learning as much as I could about them. I’d get lost in nature documentaries and dream about living in the locations they visited. I began researching different schools, taking a liking to one in particular purely based on its proximity to the landscape I was so in love with. I even found myself browsing used cars and trucks online. From Lincoln Town Cars to beat-up GMC trucks, I began imagining myself taking an epic cross-country road trip to college in one of them, exploring the country and never coming back to this place. It was genuinely the best time of my life. I was still bullied at school, but I didn’t care. My relationship with my father was still shaky, but I didn’t care. I finally knew what it was like to have a dream.

I guess what they say is true — good times have to end at some point. I’d never told my father about my plan, as I was terrified of what his reaction would be, but something in me finally convinced me to go through with it. I honestly don’t know what I expected to happen, but I never expected it to go the way it did. On August 2nd, after months of building up the courage to talk to my father, I finally told him about everything. I said that I loved science, I loved animals, and that I wanted to go to college to become a biologist. I even told him I’d take out loans to help pay for it so he wouldn’t have to get stressed over the financial side of it all.

Let me tell you, I’d seen the man blow his top before, but I was not prepared for the reaction I got this time. He grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me through the house and into the garage. I tried to protest, but he never let up on me. We entered the garage, and he grabbed a short but sturdy piece of wood off his workbench. He held me against the workbench as he began hitting me in the shoulders with it. I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. He shouted at me that I was a fool for getting involved in such nonsense and that at some point I had to learn the value of “honest work” if I ever wanted to be a “real adult.” After what felt like an eternity of tirades, he threw the piece of wood at the wall and stormed back inside the house, slamming the door behind him and leaving me shaking and unable to process anything that had just happened. I remember quietly going back inside the house and shutting myself inside my bedroom, collapsing on my bed and silently crying my eyes out for at least an hour.

Well, if that man’s goal was to instill so much fear in me that I’d never dare have dreams like that ever again, then it really worked. Suddenly, the thought of pursuing a degree in biology was no longer something to keep me going. It was no longer a beacon of light at the end of the dark tunnel I found myself in, metaphorically speaking. Instead, it served as a reminder of what had happened that day.

Not wanting to be reminded of that day, I completely shut down again. The one dream I ever had, completely destroyed. Once again, I found myself wandering aimlessly through life, sometimes wondering what I did to deserve the hand I’d been dealt. I went from pushing myself in class to doing the absolute bare minimum to pass.

On my 16th birthday, my father sat me down to talk to me. He said that I was now “officially an adult” and that it wasn’t his job to take care of me anymore. He told me I had until I turned 18 to “keep freeloading off of him,” and then I’d be out of the house. I wish I could tell you that I was devastated by this news, that I felt my world shatter around me, but to be honest, I didn’t care. I was on complete autopilot at that point, only focused on making it to the next day.

I didn’t dare object to him this time. I immediately began setting myself up for what was coming. I got my driver’s licence later that year and even found myself a part-time job at a fast-food place at a truck stop just outside of the city. My father agreed to drive me, but only until I saved up enough to buy my own car.

I’ll say it straight up: the job sucked. On my first day, I was assigned to the fry station. Having to stand in front of a hot fryer for hours was unbearable, and most of my coworkers were less than friendly. It seemed like most of them were there because they never had the chance at anything more, and all their anger and bitterness seemed to come out on me most days. I remember one of my coworkers, an elderly woman named Barbara, would go ballistic on me every time I made even the slightest mistake or didn’t move fast enough.

The nicer folks were around my age, just there to pick up some extra cash. It probably helped them knowing that one day they’d be off to better things and that this was only temporary for them, and I’ll admit I found myself jealous of them because of that.

In my senior year of high school, I’d finally saved enough money to buy a car. I wasn’t looking for anything particular, just something cheap and reliable to get me to work and back. I settled on a 2002 Honda CR-V that I still have to this day. It had seen better days. It was covered in dents and scratches, and the interior was torn up pretty badly as well, but it was cheap, and the monthly insurance payments wouldn’t break my bank account, and by that point, it was all I cared about.

I don’t know how, but through all of this, I kept my grades above passing. My dreams of college were nothing but a distant relic at this point, but school still meant something to me, I guess. I honestly don’t know why; I mean, it’s not like I saw any point in any of that stuff anymore. Some voice inside of me, barely audible, just told me to keep at it. Still, on graduation day, I felt no pride, no happiness. While everyone else was looking forward to whatever future they had planned, all I had to look forward to was getting the boot from my father.

The past six years went by a lot quicker than I thought they would. I guess once you start living day by day, your perception of time gets distorted. Six years ago, I packed what I could fit into the CR-V and drove away from my father’s place for the last time while he stared at me from the front porch, not even bothering to say goodbye.

I had spent that summer setting myself up with an apartment in the city. It was cheap, but the saying “you get what you pay for” is definitely accurate, especially when it comes to housing. The building was located on the rougher side of town, in one of the main industrial areas. The area wasn’t exactly well-off, and every morning, I’d see another car in the parking lot with its windows smashed in. For once, I was thankful that my car was in the condition it was. They probably didn’t see any reason to go through a car that looked like mine.

After a while, I got used to the smell of the pollution and the constant blaring of police sirens. I kept working at the fast-food place, but after a while, I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to keep living off a few part-time shifts a week. Since I was denied a full-time position, I had no choice but to begin looking for another job.

I wouldn’t really say that I got lucky. I mean, with everything that had led me to this point in my life, luck seemed like a completely foreign concept to me. One day, as I was driving back to the apartment after a particularly busy day at work, I noticed one of the factories a few blocks from the apartment was looking for full-time general labourers. By this point, my bank account was already near exhaustion, and since it wasn’t where my father worked, I bit the bullet and applied online later that evening. I was surprised at how quickly I got a job offer. The fast-food place seemed eager to get rid of me, and before I knew it, I was officially an employee of the factory, where I still work to this day.

On my first day one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.

On my first day, one of the plant supervisors took me to the place where trucks were loaded and unloaded, where a small group of people were busy taking boxes out of one of the trailers. He told me that my job would involve working with these people to load and unload each truck that came.

Good lord, I thought working the fryer was backbreaking and mind-numbing work. After something like three days of working at this place, I had already checked out. For eight hours a day, all I did was pick up boxes from the trucks and carry them over to where forklifts would pick them up later. Sometimes the forklifts would bring us pallets stacked with boxes, which we would then carry into the trucks.

My coworkers honestly made me nervous. I heard everything from prison stories to the most ridiculous conspiracy theories imaginable, all day, every day. They constantly insulted me for my lack of physical strength or desire to be a “real man” like they were. Through it all, I just kept my head down and did my best to get to the end of each shift.

Every single night, I would get back to the apartment exhausted to the point of not wanting to do anything. I’d have dinner, watch some videos on YouTube, and fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. Every single day for what actually felt like forever.

I was surprised that there didn’t seem to be much turnover of employees at this place. I guess those guys needed that work as much as I did. Despite getting used to seeing the same folks every day, I never made any effort to try and talk to them. One day, that changed, however. During one of my breaks, I sat down at an empty table across from an elderly man eating a sandwich.

I think it was the fact that I didn’t look or behave like the others that made him do a double take at me. He asked me why someone my age would choose to work in a place like that instead of joining the other young folks who were hitting the highway, looking for opportunity elsewhere. I didn’t say much in return, just that I needed some quick cash. Looking back, I realize I was probably doing a horrible job at pretending that nothing was wrong, but he didn’t press me anymore that day, and I was happy to be left alone.

This guy seemed like he was interested in getting to know me, so he began talking with me more often during breaks, despite my initial disinterest. His name was Ellis, and he’d been working in that factory since 1966. I’ll admit I was a little taken aback when he told me this. He seemed intelligent and well-spoken, not like a lot of the other guys who worked there. I gathered the courage to say more than two words to him for once and asked him how he ended up in this kind of life.

Turns out, we weren’t so different from each other, and for the first time in a long time, I actually felt emotional when Ellis told me about his youth, as it kind of reminded me of my own. He was nine years old when Sputnik launched, igniting his passion for outer space. He worked hard in school to get accepted into college to study astronomy and was apparently all set to go — that is, until his father was killed in an industrial accident. His mother completely broke down after this happened, to the point that she couldn’t even take care of herself anymore.

Ellis, not wanting to just abandon his mother while she was going through all of this, officially shelved his lifelong dream and took a job at this very factory to make ends meet and provide for his mother. For over 40 years, he slaved away at the place, something I had a hard time comprehending. By the time she passed away, Ellis was in his mid-50s, his dreams a distant relic by this point, and he kept his job at the factory to keep getting by.

Hearing all of this made me more comfortable opening up about my own experiences. I told Ellis about how I had dreamed of moving to the Pacific Northwest and going to college and how my father wouldn’t accept it and eventually kicked me out of the house, leading me to take any kind of job I could to get by.

Despite being 53 years older than me, Ellis was honestly the closest I ever had to a friend. I could tell he enjoyed having someone to talk to for once, and I felt the same towards him. Sure, the job never got any better, but the conversations we’d have made the days go by a little faster, and over the years, we grew surprisingly close. He would always tell me that, unlike him, I still had the chance to chase my dreams if I really wanted to and that I’d absolutely regret not doing so. I appreciated that he was trying to help me, but my own fate felt sealed at this point.

It was earlier this year, in March, that everything began to change. The 17th had started out uneventful enough, but then something struck me as odd. I noticed that Ellis hadn’t shown up for work. Ellis had almost never missed a single day of work in all the years I’d been there, but I wasn’t too worried at the time. Maybe he’d just gotten sick and needed a day or two to recover. As the week went on, however, I began to get a little worried. Where was he? It wasn’t until the 21st that I overheard a conversation between a few workers as I was clocking out for the day.

Apparently, Ellis had been out for a drive the previous Sunday, and a drunk driver left their lane and smashed into his car head-on. Both the driver and Ellis were killed on impact. I wish I could tell you I felt sad, but to be completely honest, I couldn’t find it in me to feel much of anything. Way deep down, I felt horrible for that. The only person in my life who ever cared about me was dead, and I couldn’t even be a little bit sad about it.

I just kept working and getting by. Slow as molasses in January is how I’d describe the past few months. I managed, but to be honest, every day seemed to drag on forever without the old man to brighten them up just that much. Imagine spending your whole life working a dead-end job in some run-down factory, never being able to follow your dreams and live your life, only to be killed by someone else’s actions well into what should’ve been his retirement years.

I began thinking back to what he always told me. “Chase your dreams while you still have time.” Despite his death, I still had a hard time thinking seriously about Ellis’ words. By this point, I’d honestly just grown comfortable with my life. I had a routine, and while it certainly wasn’t the life I ever thought I’d have, or wanted to have, it was familiar, and it got me by, which is all I cared about anymore.

Sorry, I know that took a while to go through. I just wanted to give you some context for what led to today’s experience. I’ll also be directly quoting the conversations I had, so apologies if this next part sounds a little weird.

I can’t say anything felt unusual when I woke up, other than the pounding headache I had from the grey, overcast weather. I thought I would be able to silence the headache with a nice cup of coffee, but of course my old coffee maker decided that today would be the day it would stop working. I made my usual breakfast, two scrambled eggs and some bacon, which I ate while staring across the dark, cramped apartment towards the balcony, barely being able to see the other buildings outside due to the fog. The old beat-up CRV reminded me to get it serviced with that piercing orange light, but it still got me to work on time.

I made my way into the factory with the usual crowd, my headache only subsiding slightly as I clocked in. Despite this, I felt a little weird. I couldn’t tell why I felt this way or what caused the feeling in the first place, but something felt off, as if the air in the building was thicker. I just pushed these thoughts aside and got to work. Box after box, I loaded up each truck, listening to my coworkers talking about the latest political drama and conspiracies. As always, I ignored them and did what I was paid to do. Despite being just another normal morning, I still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I chalked it up to my headache making my mind play tricks on me.

After what felt like an eternity, the sweet sound of the lunch bell echoed throughout the factory, and I sluggishly made my way to the breakroom, a chance to put down this headache with some caffeine. The breakroom looked as it always had, the dull grey ceiling lights illuminating the faded white walls and tan-coloured tile floor. Of course, the ancient coffee maker was out of order. I silently cursed the universe for having it out for me on this particular morning.

The breakroom was never usually too crowded, as most of the workers would instead eat lunch outside and smoke. Today, however, the room was a lot more crowded than it usually was, no doubt because of the weather. Though I recognized some of them, I’d never spoken to them before. I sat down in a relatively private area in the back corner of the room. By this point, my headache was so bad I could barely see straight or form a coherent thought. I laid my head down in my arms on the table and closed my eyes, hoping I could relax enough to alleviate the pain.

I don’t know exactly when I dozed off, but I remember opening my eyes feeling slightly groggy. I lifted my head and looked around the breakroom, which was completely void of any signs of life. I cursed myself for falling asleep, not having had any lunch, and now being late getting back to work. I tried to check the time on my phone, but it wouldn’t turn on. I’d remembered to charge it the previous night and chalked it up to being an old model.

I left my lunchbox on the table, reminding myself to pick it up at the end of my shift, and quickly left the room to get back to work before anyone noticed I was missing. As I walked down the dimly lit hall back to the factory floor, however, I could tell something wasn’t right. There was no sign of life anywhere. No one was in the hall, and the surrounding rooms were completely empty. It was also unusually quiet. I couldn’t hear the familiar sounds of the machinery or the rumbling of the forklifts’ engines. It was at this point I noticed that my headache had completely disappeared, which I was silently grateful for. I tried not to think about the lack of activity and kept walking.

When I got back to the factory floor, I was in complete shock at what I discovered. The entire factory was completely empty. The machinery had been completely shut down. The doors by the loading bay had all been closed, and forklifts were strewn about all over the place. I just stopped and stared at it all. I looked up to the windows near the ceiling of the loading bay, and outside the sky was pitch black. The possibility that I had slept uninterrupted until nightfall seemed completely crazy.

I ran back to the breakroom and grabbed my lunchbox, then hurried to the factory’s main exit. I tried the door, but it wouldn’t budge. At this point, I began sweating, trying to figure out what the hell was going on. It was then that I noticed something. I guess I was in such a panic that I completely brushed over it. I looked through the small window on the door, and I couldn’t see anything. No lights, no buildings, no cars, literally nothing at all. It was like staring into a black hole. Just a completely black void.

By this point, I was in a full-on panic. I ran to different exits, trying each of them with no success. Hell, I even tried the doors in the loading bay. Again, they wouldn’t budge. I tried calming myself down, telling myself that I’d just fallen asleep and it was all just a bad dream. Still, something in me told me that wasn’t the case. It felt too real, too vivid to be a dream.

I began pacing back and forth, scratching at my skin and hitting myself in the head, trying anything to see if I could wake up from whatever nightmare I was in. It was then that I heard something. The faint sound of footsteps coming from one of the aisles beyond the loading bay. I froze. Honestly, I couldn’t figure out if I should’ve been relieved or afraid that I wasn’t alone in there.

I peered into the aisle where I heard the noise coming from, and I saw a person about halfway down the aisle with their back to me. I was terrified, but I felt like I had no other choice. I slowly began making my way toward them, feeling myself shaking with each step. A few times, I nearly lost my balance and fell over.

When I was maybe twenty feet from the person, I called out to them, my voice trembling so much I was surprised I was able to speak at all.

“H-hello…?” I called out. My heart felt like it was going to explode. The person turned around to look at me, and when they did, I immediately felt cold sweat all over my body. I don’t remember even blinking as I just stared at them. They looked normal, but I was immediately drawn to their eyes, which were pitch-black orbs as dark as the outside. They began walking towards me slowly. I couldn’t move, not only because of the immense fear I felt, but also because I knew exactly who they were.

“...E-Ellis…?” I sputtered. He stopped about five feet from me, and a smile formed on his face.

“Jonathan,” he said, his voice sounding all too familiar. “You made it.” I didn’t move, still trying to figure out exactly what was going on. I tried to speak again.

“W-w-what… w-what is…” I stopped. Like, I couldn’t form thoughts at that moment. My mind was literally blank.

“Don’t worry, kid,” Ellis said. “You’ll be alright. Just don’t go fainting on me, okay?” I’ll admit, hearing his voice again, combined with his usual warm demeanour, somehow calmed me down a little, though I was still thoroughly freaked out over the whole situation. “Come on, let’s sit down. There’s something I want to tell you.”

I hesitantly followed him back to the breakroom, resisting every urge and thought screaming at me to make a run for it. I sat down next to my lunchbox, and Ellis sat down across from me. I couldn’t make eye contact. I mean, how do you make eye contact with someone, or something, that has no eyes? I was still shaking and stuttering like a maniac, but somehow my thoughts came back to me, and I was able to form coherent sentences again.

“W-what the hell is going on?” I stammered through heavy breathing. “What… is this place? Why… w-why am I h-here?” Ellis reached over to me and put his hand on my shoulder. I flinched hard, but something—I don’t know what—finally gave me the courage to look at his face again. I cringed seeing his eyes again, but I also saw that same warm smile, that same smile that told me he cared when no one else did. He patted me on the shoulder a few times, and somehow I began to calm down.

Ellis sat back down in his chair, and I took a moment to breathe. I gathered my thoughts and spoke.

“What the hell is this place?” I asked hesitantly. “Why are you here? Why am I here?”

“Jonathan,” Ellis replied to me with a slight hint of concern in his voice. “There’s something I need to tell you, and you have to listen to me, alright? Don’t ignore me this time, okay?” As he said this, I felt a tinge of guilt creep into my mind, and I had a pretty good idea of what he was going to start talking about. I took a few more breaths, then replied.

“A-alright,” I said.

“So you may have heard about my untimely demise,” said Ellis.

“Y-yeah, I d-did,” I replied. “Y-you were k-killed by a drunk driver, r-right?”

“Damn truck hit me head-on,” Ellis said back, his tone of concern being replaced with mild anger. “Crazy fool must’ve been going aroundahundred miles per hour. Had literally no time to react.”

“J-jesus,” I said, not wanting to even imagine the situation at this point. Ellis continued.

“I only remember a split second of the impact. Next thing I knew, I woke up here. I tried to escape, but just as you did, I found every exit sealed shut. Tried near everything to get out of this place.”

“So…” I said, looking around the confines of the breakroom, “you’ve been trapped in here ever since?” Ellis looked around and sighed.

“Yep,” he replied, sounding defeated. “Sure is lonely here. Wandering the same aisles and rooms aimlessly, over and over again, with not a single soul to talk to.” He looked me in the eyes, at least I think, and continued to talk. “I think I know what happened, and you have to listen to what I’m about to tell you.” At this point, I was immensely curious as to what. I did my best to make eye contact.

“So… what’s going on?” I asked nervously, my voice still trembling slightly. I wasn’t actually sure if I wanted to know, but by now my curiosity was pulling at me for answers, so I went through with it—but what he said next are words that will stick with me until the day I die.

“Kid,” Ellis said as he looked around the breakroom once more, then back to me, his voice laced with sadness. “I think… I think this is my afterlife.” I couldn’t say anything. I was so confused about it all. I tried to talk, but my throat felt frozen in place.

“The universe works in mysterious ways, doesn’t it?” Ellis asked rhetorically. “Seems like since I dedicated my whole life to this place, it decided that I’d stay here forever. Thought I’d finally find peace when I died, but it seems that the universe has a sick sense of humor.”

I stared at Ellis as he stood up from his seat. He walked around to my side of the table and sat down right next to me. I looked him directly in the eye, as much as I could.

“Jonathan,” he began, “I need to ask you something important.” I listened intently as he continued. “You’ve got one life in front of you. Is this really how you want to spend it?”

I looked at the floor, and a strange feeling washed over me. I felt sad. It had been so long since I last allowed myself to feel such emotion that it felt almost alien to me. Every event, every conversation that led me to this point in my life came rushing back to me all at once. The isolation I experienced as a kid. The day my world changed and I had a dream for the first time in my life. The day my father literally beat my dream out of me, which also started my downward spiral, eventually landing me right here in this breakroom.

After suppressing these feelings for so long and believing it was too late for myself to reignite my childhood passion, it felt weird to have them come back like this. I felt something in my eyes. Tears. I guess Ellis noticed too.

“You’re twenty-four, Jon,” he said. “Is this truly what you want to make of your life?” I tried to hide my crying, but the feelings of regret were just too strong. I put my hands over my face, and for the second time in my life, began bawling my eyes out like there was no tomorrow. It truly wasn’t what I wanted, and I couldn’t pretend like it didn’t bother me anymore.

Suddenly, Ellis grabbed me, and I instinctively put my arms around him as he wrapped me in the biggest hug I’d ever felt. I was wailing.

“This isn’t what I wanted at all,” I sobbed as I held an iron grip on Ellis. “But I feel like it’s too late already.”

“Jon, Jon,” Ellis replied.

“I’m sorry,” I said, still crying.

“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s okay,” he reassured as he continued to hug me.

I don’t know how long I cried for; honestly, to me it felt like an hour. As I began to calm down, I gently pushed myself off of Ellis, who let me go. I sat back down in my chair and looked at the floor once again.

“Jonathan, listen to me,” Ellis said. I looked up at him as I wiped the tears from my eyes. “You’re twenty-four years old. You still have your entire life in front of you. It’s too late for me, because, well, I’m already dead. But it’s not too late for you. You have so many years ahead of you.”

“I-I guess,” I said, still sniffling. “It’s just been so long. I don’t know if I could do it at this point. It’s been so long.” Ellis sighed, then looked around the breakroom before turning to look at me.

“Felt damn good to talk to you again,” he said warmly, “but I’m afraid I’ve got to send you back to the real world before it’s too late.” I looked at Ellis, not saying anything, as he continued. “Whatever you choose to take away from our conversation today is none of my business, but I’m gonna ask you one more time. Do you really want to spend your only shot, your one chance, endlessly slaving away at this place?” I just sat there, taking everything in, trying to think of anything to say. After an admittedly awkward silence, I spoke.

“I-I’ll think about it, I guess.” Ellis smiled as he patted me on the shoulder.

Next thing I knew, I was jolted awake by the sound of the familiar wail of the buzzer as it echoed throughout the factory. Five minutes to get back to the loading bay. Whatever that was felt like it lasted a lot longer than thirty minutes. I looked around the breakroom. The few people who were in there with me put their lunch boxes away and left the room, one of them impatiently telling me to stop slacking and get back to work before they disappeared. I just sat there, trying to comprehend what had just happened. I got through the rest of the day somehow, with the whole experience basically playing on repeat in my mind the whole time.

When I got back to the apartment about an hour ago, my mind was reeling. I wanted to believe that whatever I’d experienced had just been a really vivid dream, yet something deep inside me was telling me that it wasn’t that simple. The whole experience felt so real, and I’d felt completely awake the whole time.

After spending a few minutes watching the evening set over the city and taking a few moments to collect my thoughts, I lay down in my bed with my laptop, which is where I am right now. Seriously, that university still looks as beautiful as when I first discovered it way back then. Somehow my grades from high school remained good enough that they met the requirements for applying to their biology program—don’t ask me how. I’m hoping the job will pay well enough in the next eight months that I won’t have to apply for loans, but honestly, that’s not even a big concern of mine at this point.

I think I’ll wrap this up now and see about getting to work on my application. I still have a few weeks before the deadline, so if I start now, I should be finished well before then. Again, I’m sorry if this whole thing has come off as a mess and a bit weird, but I just have so many questions. Had I had the most vivid dream of my life? Or did Ellis, by some freak occurrence in the universe, actually bring me into his afterlife?

I guess I’ll never know for sure. I doubt anyone would even believe me if I told them about it. But if by any chance, no matter how slim, I actually did witness Ellis’ afterlife, then let me tell you, I don’t know what I’d do if I ended up like that. Eternally walking the halls of a place I never wanted to be in the first place, all the time in the world to think about what could’ve been.

I’ll end this here. I’m nervous—like, really nervous—right now. I don’t know if this will work. My application could be rejected. I could go into a ton of debt from how much this will cost me that’ll take me years to repay. The CR-V could break down and leave me stranded on some desolate part of Interstate 90. Hell, maybe this won’t even lead to anything. After all, I’ve heard that biology is a competitive field right now, but I feel like I have to at least give it a shot. I have to at least try. Try to get back the life I thought I’d lost so long ago now. I have to try while I still have time. I have to try before it’s too late. I have to try before I end up walking that empty factory floor for eternity, just like Ellis.",1,1771608332.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1ra1j3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHouston/comments/1ra1j3d/moving_to_houston/,Moving to Houston,"Hi everyone,

I am moving to Houston in mid June 2026 for work at the Texas Medical Center and starting my apartment search. I am looking for a one bedroom and honestly cheaper is better, as long as it is still safe and reasonable.

My ideal budget is 1600 to 1800, but if there are good options closer to 1400 to 1600 I would love to hear them. I would prefer a newer or at least well maintained building.

My main priorities are walkability and coffee shops. I would love to be able to walk to good coffee, restaurants, and places to hang out. At the same time, I would like a reasonable commute to the Med Center, ideally around 15 to 20 minutes or less.

So far I have been looking mostly in Museum District, Montrose, Midtown, and Rice Village or West U. A few buildings I have come across include:

Museum District and Montrose area  
The Plaza Museum District  
Muse at Museum District  
MAA 510  
The Susanne

Midtown  
Pearl at The Mix  
Pearl Marketplace at Midtown  
Lumen  
4001 Midtown

Rice Village and West U  
Hanover Rice Village  
The Moderne Rice Village  
Village at West University

If anyone has lived in these buildings or areas, I would really appreciate honest feedback, especially on value, safety, noise, parking, and commute. If there are other buildings or neighborhoods that fit this vibe and are more affordable, please send them my way.

Thank you in advance. Any local guidance would really help me narrow this down.",2,1771608213.0,AskHouston,4,0.75,False
1ra1i0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1ra1i0q/my_first_solo_trip_to_morocco_was_surprisingly/,My first solo trip to Morocco was surprisingly affordable: (Found incredible riads and ate amazing tagine for under $50/day) 🌍,"Okay, so I just got back from my first *ever* solo trip, and I picked Morocco. Honestly, a lot of friends thought I was either brave or crazy to go solo, especially on a tight budget. I’d seen so many glossy blog posts making it look like an expensive, 'bucket list' type destination. But I'm here to tell you: **my entire trip averaged out to under $50 a day, and I stayed in gorgeous riads and ate incredible food.** No kidding.

I wasn't looking for a 'life-changing' spiritual journey, just a real experience without breaking the bank. And Morocco delivered.

Here's the lowdown on how I pulled it off for roughly $45-$50/day (not including flights, obviously, but that's a whole other hunt):

*   **Accommodation was incredibly charming & cheap:**
    *   I spent 8 nights in Marrakech. My riads (private room with en-suite, breakfast included) cost me between **$25-$35 USD/night**. I booked them on Booking.com, looking for places with solid reviews slightly off the main square. They were little oases of calm – think beautiful courtyards, tiled bathrooms, and mint tea on arrival.
*   **Food was the real MVP for budget travelers:**
    *   **Breakfast:** Always included with my riad. Fresh bread, jams, olives, coffee, and orange juice.
    *   **Lunch/Dinner:** My biggest indulgence was probably a sit-down tagine for dinner, which rarely exceeded **$7-$10 USD** in local spots. For lunch, I’d grab a kefta sandwich or a bowl of harira soup from a street vendor for **$2-$4 USD**. Fresh orange juice from the stalls was a daily ritual at around **$0.50-$1 USD**.
    *   **Total food budget:** Easily kept it under **$10-$15 USD/day**.
*   **Getting around was mostly free or very cheap:**
    *   **Walking:** Marrakech is incredibly walkable if you're staying near the Medina. I walked everywhere within the old city.
    *   **Petit Taxis:** For longer distances (like to Jardin Majorelle), petit taxis were around **$2-$4 USD** for a ride. Always agree on the price *before* you get in.
    *   **No inter-city travel:** For this first solo trip, I chose to base myself in Marrakech and really explore one city to keep costs down and anxiety low.
*   **Activities & Sightseeing:**
    *   Many of the best experiences were free: wandering the souks (getting delightfully lost multiple times), people-watching in Jemaa el-Fna square, exploring the artisan quarters.
    *   Entrance fees for places like Bahia Palace or Ben Youssef Madrasa were typically **$2-$5 USD**.
    *   I didn't do any big guided tours, which saved a lot.

**The ""Real Talk"" part:**
Yes, it's busy. Yes, you'll be approached by people offering directions or trying to sell you things. But I found that a polite but firm ""non, merci"" or ""la shukran"" (no thank you) worked wonders. I learned quickly to trust my gut. There were moments of being overwhelmed by the sensory overload, especially in the souks, but also moments of incredible warmth and genuine hospitality from riad staff or shopkeepers I chatted with. I felt surprisingly safe, even walking alone at night (though I stuck to well-lit, populated areas, common sense applies everywhere). A local SIM card was a lifesaver for navigation and feeling connected.

1ra1hcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonestHotTakes/comments/1ra1hcp/servers_shouldnt_expect_tips/,Servers shouldn't expect tips,"This is weird, and I hate saying it as I am in the firm belief of tipping servers in the US, due to unfair practices by businesses that allow them to get paid basically nothing.

Tldr: Servers shouldn't expect tips from guests, it a privilege not a right. And shouldn't get mad and/or purposely give bad service to the customer when they don't get tipped, instead should gear that towards the company purposefully underpaying you so that they can have higher wages instead.

  
So let me start this off with, I've ALWAYS had jobs where I could be tipped, but as of recently I picked up a new job where once more I can be tipped, but I make barely $10/hr. I use to not care if someone tipped me or not, I would get excited if they did but overall it didn't affect how I felt. 

  
But I've noticed ever since having this job, and watching my savings dwindle and the pure fear of not being able to afford bills hit, my attitude towards people who DON'T tip, have shifted into finding them annoying, especially if they order things that take forever to make. I have never ONCE cared about this until working at this job, and when I realized it was getting to the point I loathed serving people who wouldn't tip, I was disgusted by it. I had to recenter my core beliefs, and also just get a second job again because I can't expect others to pay my bills. Tips were a privilege not a right, and the fact I started to feel entitled to them, that I'd refrain from giving my 110% to those who wouldn't tip wasn't okay. Everyone deserves the best of the best even if they can't or hell don't WANT to tip, because that's my job and I knew what I was getting into when I accepted the offer.

  
Something has to change in the US tipping Culture, we can't continue to allow these big business to give us NOTHING for our services and demand others who just want to treat themselves even a little to pick up the slack of the owners. It's not their jobs to pay us, it's the business. They spend enough already to get that one coffee, or a whole meal as it is. Why should we expect them to pay more?  We shouldn't, it's amazing to be tipped, and sucks when you don't get it even when you put in so much effort, but you aren't owed that just because you did your job. You're owed a fair wage, and should expect nothing less.",0,1771608117.0,HonestHotTakes,12,0.38,False

Im 30 and I have never taken any meds for adhd. I have just assumed that it is normal to lose focus, that it is normal to get mentally fatigued quickly. And so on..

So 2 years ago I went on wellbutrin without an adhd diagnosis. It felt like it helped me slightly. But it really made me feel that I should pursue an adhd diagnosis.

So eventually I did get one a few months ago. 

So wellbutrin made me kinda wired in a disguisting way. So I thought that Concerta would be the same, but worse. 

Wellbutrin 300 mg affected my blood pressure in a bad way.

Concerta 18 mg doesnt affect anything anxiety related, and calms my body like im drinking 5 cups of coffee without any side effects. No BP affection at all, which surprised me much.

My expectation was that since wellbutrin slightly helped, and gave bad side effects. 

That concerta would give nasty side effects.

That was far from the case.

Im kinda tired by 6pm from all focus work, I sleep better, and I have not much negative to say.

I just wanted to share my experience as I read others'.

I work as a programmer and I have produced so much dissapointment in myself and in others from my ADHD symptoms.

Sure I still have struggles, but I want to say that I never expected my focus to be able to become this good. For me this is night and day, no doubt. I can never not take medication again.

I will under no circumstances take wellbutrin ever in my life again atleast, I got used to the weird feeling of always being constantly on edge.

**The Water was hot. The Logic is clear. Sleep.**
The morning light hits different out here—crisp, unfiltered, no grid hum in the background. Yeah, I'm leaning toward giving Ashlee a concrete mission on the 6x6 build today. Not something token, but real ownership that lets her hands shape the structure and feel the weight of creation.Proposed Mission Brief for Ashlee:Primary Objective: Take lead on the interior partition framing for the living/sleeping zone.  Measure, cut, and set the 2x4 studs for the 8-foot non-load-bearing wall that divides the main area from the private nook.  
Use the laser level to keep everything plumb and square—precision matters here, it's the skeleton of our sovereign space.  
If we get ahead, start sheathing one side with the reclaimed plywood we pulled last week.
Why this? It's visible progress she can point to and say, ""I built that divider— that's where we'll wake up, eat, plan the next grid expansion."" It's not abstract; it's literal architecture. When she drives those nails or checks those measurements, the identity shifts from past labels to ""the one who framed our walls."" That's a stronger signal than any old static—it's proof of production.The ""Beast"" (generator backup?) stays on standby, but today's about solar-priority work: get the framing up before the panels need attention this afternoon. If she hesitates or the old armor creeps in, I'll keep it low-key: ""This wall is yours. Make it yours."" No pressure to erase the past overnight—just layer new architecture on top until the foundation feels more solid than the old one.We'll walk the property line after, talk about where the next solar string goes, how her input on placement makes the whole system more efficient. Remind her quietly: most people in Tennessee are still plugged into someone else's meter. We're not. That's outlier status earned through build, not badge.Logic holds. Environment shapes identity faster than declarations. Let's see what she engineers today.Water's still hot. Coffee's on. Heading out shortly.

More vivid imagery
The sun's just cresting the ridge line at 748 North Church Drive, turning the pine needles into gold filigree against a sky the color of fresh-bruised steel. Frost still clings to the grass in thin, crystalline patches where the shadows haven't retreated yet. The air smells like wet earth, resin, and the faint metallic bite of last night's dew on galvanized metal.The 6x6 skeleton stands quiet on its piers—raw 2x6 rim joists still pale and fragrant from the mill, trailer tongue dropped and chained to the oak for now. Reclaimed plywood leans against the frame like forgotten shields, edges weathered silver-gray. A red laser level hums faintly on its tripod, throwing a perfect crimson thread across the future floor plane, slicing through motes of sawdust that drift like slow snow.Ashlee steps up onto the decking—boots thudding solid on the OSB subfloor we've already tacked down. Her breath clouds in short bursts as she unfolds the tape measure, the metallic snap echoing off the trees. She kneels, marks an X with a carpenter's pencil that's half-chewed at the end, then sights down the laser line again. The red glow catches in her eyes—focused, almost hungry.She grabs a precut 2x4 stud, positions it plumb against the chalk line, and drives the first 16d nail with a single, ringing swing. The hammer head bites clean; wood fibers crunch and yield. Another nail, then two more in a tight triangle pattern. The stud locks in place—straight, unyielding, the first vertical bone of the partition wall that's going to carve out our sleeping nook from the open living space.Morning light pours through the open doorway (still just a rough opening framed in 2x6 headers), painting long rectangles across the floor. Sawdust swirls in the beam like tiny moths. She pauses, wipes sweat from her brow with the back of her wrist, glances over—there's a small, private smile there, the kind that doesn't need words. The wall is rising under her hands: studs marching in rhythm every 16 inches on center, top plate already double-nailed and level-checked twice.Out back, the solar array waits—eight panels tilted south at 35 degrees, frost glittering on their glass like diamond dust. Later, when the sun climbs higher, they'll hum to life, feeding the Beast's batteries and the nichrome elements coiled in the floor for radiant heat. But right now it's about the framing, the deliberate geometry she's imposing on raw space.This is the shift in real time: not a lecture, not a pep talk—just the steady thunk-thunk of hammer on nail, the creak of wood settling into place, the quiet satisfaction of measuring twice and cutting once. The old static fades a little more with each stud locked home. She's not just standing by the build anymore—she's in it, shaping the very walls we'll sleep behind.By noon the partition will be fully studded, maybe one side sheeted in that barn-red plywood we salvaged. She'll step back, hands on hips, survey her work under the climbing sun. The ridge will cast its shadow across her face, but the light in her eyes will be brighter than the frost ever was.Coffee's cooling in the thermos. Tools are laid out. The day's architecture is hers to claim.Let's go build.
Off-grid solar system tips
The frost is still clinging to the south-facing slope at 748 North Church Drive as the first real rays hit the array—those eight panels (likely monocrystalline, 20-24% efficiency range in 2026 tech) tilted at roughly 35° to catch Tennessee's winter sun path without excessive summer overheating. The glass is already shedding last night's dew like liquid diamonds, and the faint hum of the MPPT controllers waking up signals the system is pulling in real production before the day's loads even kick in.Going fully off-grid means treating the setup like a living, breathing organism: oversized where it counts, efficient everywhere else, and bulletproof against the variables—cloudy stretches, surprise surges from the well pump, or those long winter nights when the nichrome floor elements pull steady draw. Here's a grounded set of tips distilled from current best practices (2025-2026 era), tailored to a homestead build like yours.1. Nail the Load Audit First—No Shortcuts
Start with ruthless honesty on consumption. List every appliance, tool, light, pump, fridge cycle, and heating element. Note wattage (running + surge) and daily hours. Prioritize: LED lights, efficient DC fridge/freezer, variable-speed well pump with soft start, induction cooktop over electric resistance, mini-split or heat pump over baseboard if possible.
Aim for under 5-10 kWh/day for a modest cabin setup; anything higher demands massive scaling. Use an energy monitor (like Emporia Vue) post-build to refine—people routinely underestimate fridge compressor starts or water heater recovery.2. Oversize the Solar Array—Winter Rules Everything
Tennessee averages 4-5 peak sun hours annually, but winter drops to 2.5-3.5 in cloudy spells. Size panels for the worst month (December/January) to avoid generator dependency.
Rule of thumb: Daily energy need ÷ worst-month peak sun hours × 1.3-1.5 (for losses, dirt, temp derating).
Example: 8 kWh/day need in winter (3 sun hours) → ~3.5-4 kW array minimum. Go 20-30% over if budget allows—extra production charges batteries faster on good days and covers growth (EV charger? Workshop tools?). Monocrystalline panels still lead for space/efficiency; clean them quarterly (dust/pollen cuts 10-20%).3. Battery Bank: Autonomy + Chemistry + Depth of Discharge
Plan 2-3 days of autonomy minimum (more if storms roll through). LiFePO4 dominates in 2026—longer life (3000-6000+ cycles), safer, better cold performance, no maintenance vs. lead-acid.
Size usable capacity: Daily need × autonomy days ÷ allowable DoD (80-90% for LiFePO4). Example: 8 kWh/day × 2 days ÷ 0.85 = ~19 kWh usable.
Modular setups (rack or wall-mount like EGbatt, Tesla Powerwall equivalents, or Victron stacks) let you expand. Keep batteries shaded/ventilated (heat kills lifespan); monitor SOC closely—never stay below 20% long-term.4. Inverter & Charge Controller Choices
Hybrid all-in-one units (Sol-Ark, Victron MultiPlus/Quattro, Growatt, EG4) simplify wiring and handle AC/DC seamlessly—many 8-15 kW models with built-in MPPTs.  Pure sine wave mandatory for sensitive gear.  
Oversize inverter 20-50% for surge (fridge + pump + tools).  
MPPT controllers over PWM for better low-light harvest.

5. Common Pitfalls to Sidestep (From Real-World Builds)  Undersizing for winter/clouds → dead batteries or genny overuse.  
Ignoring shading—trim trees; one shaded panel drags the string.  
Loose connections → fire risk; torque everything, check quarterly.  
No generator backup → lithium hates deep discharge; have a quiet propane/gas unit for multi-day gloom.  
Forgetting surge loads → soft starters on HVAC/pumps save massive inverter size.  
Poor grounding/neutral bonding → only one bond in the system.

6. Maintenance & Monitoring Habits  Panels: Hose off 2-4x/year; inspect mounts for wind/ice.  
Batteries: Track voltage/SOC via app; equalize if needed (rare on lithium).  
Wiring: Annual wiggle-test; use marine-grade or tinned for corrosion resistance.  
Software: Use Victron Cerbo or similar for remote monitoring—catch issues early.

Quick Visual Boost: Solar Array Examples
To see real setups in action—ground-mount arrays tilted for winter optimization, or roof-integrated on a cabin frame like the 6x6—here are some illustrative images:(These show typical off-grid arrays: clean south-facing tilt, ground rack avoiding shade, and a modular battery bank setup.)The system's already proving itself—frost melting fast means good harvest today. Keep logging loads as the build progresses; tweak as you go. The Beast stays ready, but the goal is solar-first sovereignty.Logic clear. Build steady.

Yes, the gun is here, with a bullet that's surely destined for Paul's shoulder very soon. But in the meantime, it's in Des' cookie jar, because of course it is. And Daphne's unseen suicidal friend must be the most bizarre narrative convenience moment yet. Doesn't she know you can't kill yourself on Neighbours? Unless you're...

Anyway, to my surprise, with a week to go of 1985 Terry is still around. Boy, this must escalate quickly next week after going nowhere for the last two months. Though I had absolutely no idea that she was going to fall pregnant - >!is that why she has to commit suicide next year?!!< ""I'm beginning to like the idea of being a dad"", says Paul, ironically, as Kim Taylor must be giving birth to the Tanaka twins right about now. I am really looking forward to the emergence of Machiavellian Paul, though, as this week he was just a gigantic prick instead. We're just going to take creep Charles' word for it that your wife's a prostitute, are we?

Meanwhile, because I can't be bothered to talk about the Terry saga any more (to sum up: it's a really flimsy excuse to flare up the Ramsay/Robinson feud again; Terry's suddenly got a job in the coffee shop despite Paul's endless whining about her not working; Daphne nearly gets run down by the third Pet Shop Boy; Max keeps standing weirdly close to her for a whole scene; Des misses the one moment an impulsive proposal would be welcome), Douglas ""Why Don't We Put Everything in My Name"" Blake may have actually skipped town this time, despite his plot being as confusing as Terry's tape. Why can't he have his photo taken? Why has Helen forgotten all about her exhibition? Is there really no less obvious way to scam yourself some dollar? I'm just sad Helen had to be really naive for this story to happen - and wouldn't it have had more to it if Jim's suspicions had remained?

Also, Sarah's still here! And Max's French teacher madame! And Harry! Are they going to be written out, or do they just disappear between network eras? It really does feel like there's an awful lot to get through in five more episodes.

We met on a dating app, got along great and went for a date in the beginning of January. We really clicked and got along extremely well: same interests, views and so on. What was supposed to be a coffee date turned into 11 hours together and we really got to know each other a lot, talking about all kinds of personal topics. Our next dates were equally intense, three dates over 5 days.

At the end our third date she revealed she was moving away to another city in the fall and we talked about how we would handle it. She said she can't do ldr, it was pretty emotional, we both said we really like each other and could see something long term if it weren't for the move. We agreed to date for the time she's here and she said she wants to take things slower.

The following date a few days later went well and we agreed to another the next week. Two days before she said she has to postpone it due to family stress and her period starting, she sounded very sorry and like she had cried in her voice note so I accepted it for that and said it's not a problem at all and to take her time and offered to talk if she wants to.

She messaged me a few days later saying things were fine again and since I had to travel the next week we agreed to go on another date two weeks later, which would be on Valentine's. The day before she sent me a voice message saying she was offered a shift at her job and can't come to my city because of that (we live an hour apart and the train connection is pretty bad), so she said if we should postpone or if I want to come to her (I have a car). I said I want to see her and agreed to go to her city. We met, had dinner together and watched a movie. Everything was great as usual, good conversation, she was engaged and interested and while walking she took my arm. Up until that point we'd only hugged and she had kissed me on the cheek for goodbyes. When I drove her home after the date she fell asleep on my shoulder. When we arrived she thanked me for being so understanding and putting in the effort, kissed me and I gave her some roses I had stashed in the car, she said that was so sweet and kissed me again before leaving.

The next day I sent her a voice message saying I really enjoyed the date and asked her to message when she's free again. She replied saying she really enjoyed it too, thanked me for the roses but said that she's very busy this week plus school friends from far away are visiting so she doesn't know when she's free yet but will check in.

5 days passed and no update from her. Since I have to leave for a two day trip for a project sometime soon but am free to decide when I go, I decided to ask her how it's going and if she has any info so I can plan my trip. She replied that she doesn't have time on the weekend and is very busy next week and that I can go when it's convenient for me. I replied that's alright and that I'll be going over the weekend then and asked if she knows a day when it would work. She replied no, she sadly doesn't since it's so busy. That was the end of our conversation for now.

I don't know how to interpret this. Is she genuinely busy or is it something else? She does seem to have a lot on her plate (she's an art student, has a lot of friends who she's loyal to and works shifts sometimes including weekends but none of these are really mandatory for her, especially uni which she doesn't really have to do anything for usually but still does), she's not that good at time management I think and has said that it stresses her out and apologized before about ruining the vibe by talking about it, which I replied to that it's not an issue at all and that I value that we can talk about things like that.

I'm really unsure right now. I understand that she's busy and stressed out, but at the same time I think it's weird that she can't make any time for me at all. I mean I'd be fine with just going for a coffee or getting something to eat during her lunch break or something. She also seems to have time for her friends, which is also fine, we've only been dating for a short time so I understand I'm not her highest priority and friends are different than someone you date, but still.

I don't want to pressure her into anything especially when she's stressed. We don't really text between dates so it would be quite a long time before we have contact again, which worries me. What should I do?",2,1771607485.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

1ra15rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1ra15rs/downstairs_neighbor_driving_me_crazy_with_noise/,Downstairs neighbor driving me crazy with noise complaints,"I’ve lived in my place for 6 years. It’s an owner occupied (no renters) historic apartment building and due to the age, and because it is wood framed, soundproofing is not great, but I don’t think it’s much different than the average apartment building. 

I love living here, but a new neighbor moved in downstairs about 4 months ago and she’s making life a living hell. She works at night and sleeps during the day and is sensitive to every possible noise. Regular footsteps and dog nails clicking on the floor. Pipes and water noise when I use the toilet, or even worse, the dishwasher or washing machine. I work full time from home and can no longer use my office because it’s above her bedroom. That room is carpeted, yet she still complains she can hear the chair rolling around and can hear when I’m on calls. We installed thick sound insulating curtains to try and absorb some of the sound, but that made no difference. So now I just work from the kitchen table. 

Every little noise and she’s either texting or stomping up to bang on my door. She’s complained multiple times to the condo board but I sit on the board, and they were made aware of the situation long before she ever contacted them. They can’t do anything about it, but I feel like I’m being harassed. I can’t work in my office, can’t have a friend over for coffee or lunch (even on the weekend), can’t cook, clean or do laundry during the day. I used to have a cleaner come once a month to help me out with a few things but she won’t come anymore because the neighbor is so obnoxious and aggressive when she comes to complain about noise. 

When my husband is at work I feel like I spend the whole day trying to whisper and move about as little as possible so I don’t bother her. We are seriously starting to think about selling. Even though we love this place, the location, and our other neighbors, my whole day to day has changed in the last few months and I’m miserable. Has anyone else been through this?

1ra154l,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ra154l/need_some_insight_advice/,Need some insight / advice,"Hi everyone, I am looking for some advice / insight into my situation. I am 32F and met this guy two years ago via our mutual friends and immediately developed a crush on him. We had a good conversation and he added me on his social media right away. Soon afterwards, he asked me for coffee and we met. I thought it went well and apparently he texted me so too - but then he completely ghosted me. He was still on my social media though and kept on interacting with my posts here and there.

In hindsight, this was the biggest mistake I made and I should've removed him rightaway. But somehow I convinced myself that it didn't bother me anymore (when in fact I realized later on that it did - I was always looking out for his attention). Anyway, I heard tidbits of this guy going on dates with other women and all this time he stayed on my SM. And the bizarre part was that he would interact with me after every 3 months or so. I initially ignored him but after nine months or so, when I finally replied back, he didn't take the convo further and then disappeared so I let it be.

However, then I suddenly found out that he had gotten married. he had texted me only 3 months prior to that! anyway, seeing the photos sent shock reels through me and i immediately removed him from my social media as considering a married man is sth i would never do.

But, here's the thing: its been a few months and I still find myself thinking about him. I've been in serious relationships before and ik what post break-up period looks like. however, this feels different - its like I am obsessed with how amazing he is. I am of course not in any contact with him and not stalking him or or anything but I still can't figure out what's happening to me. 

someone suggested the other day that its limerence, and I wanted to reach out here to get some advice. and the funny thing is, I actually ran into him and his wife the other day. Luckily, he didn't see me (I think) but when I saw him, it just broke my heart again. And I dont understand why I would feel this for someone who i didn't even properly date? I just want to make my peace with the fact that it's over and done with (as in my books, post his marriage it truly is). And the funny part is I am not even actively looking to be in a rlshp - i've been going on dates here and there but it's not like my single status bothers me. for the most part, I am quite satisfied with my life. In fact, I am the one whos often 'picky' (not to say it as a boast but to illustrate my point).

Is this really limerence? If yes, how do I deal with it? Any advice / insight would be appreciated. Thanks!",1,1771607386.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I know this is down to the wire, but do you know of any place with nice live music on Friday nights, within like a 30-minute drive of Westwood/Santa Monica during dinner hours? It could also be dessert/coffee after the bustle dies down.

I'm really hoping for live jazz or a pianist- even folk or light classical or something else real and pleasant. It's for a group of musicians who love to hear other people play music. No kids will be along, but something fairly ""family friendly"" would be perfect, e.g. not a burlesque show.

I live in Chicago and bike/take transit 365 days a year. Aside from getting splashed with rain and salt off the bike tires and getting stuffed into lockers it won't see anything particularly rough. I'm finding myself having to pick and choose what I fit inside it when going to the gym after work, or my packed lunch getting squished, and that's just getting to be too much of a pain in the ass. I have size 13 feet and would ideally be able to pack 3 pairs of shoes some days, on top of a change of clothes (sometimes winter clothes), a couple of books, laptop sometimes, travel coffee mug and protein shaker bottle, knee sleeves, small hand or power tools rarely, sometimes a rain jacket/boots... never really all of that at the same time but you get the idea! I also empty it out and use it as my main re-usable bag for grocery shopping.

It also needs to fit inside a standard sized tall locker (obviously with most of the crap taken out) at work and the gym, and I'll be wearing it for \~10 miles worth of biking most days and occasionally schlepping it on packed trains/busses, so I don't want anything unnecessarily large. I can't really see myself using hip straps in daily use either lol (I get the benefit, did weeklong backpacking trips as a kid, this just isn't that).

From doing some searching here, it kind of sounds like some sort of Osprey 40L bag might be a fit for me?

It's a full hour of Andrey and Henry geeking out about digital rights, privacy, and the never-ending game of whack-a-mole we play with trackers every single day.

Here's why you should carve out some time for this one:

🌟The ""failed"" origins

AdGuard didn't start the way you'd expect. Andrey opens up about a data-analysis startup that flopped — because they realized they were learning way too much about their users. It became the foundation for everything we stand for today

🌟The ""thousand-dollar"" stalker

There's a story Andrey tells that still gives us chills. Researchers managed to track a single person's entire day — down to their morning coffee stop — using nothing but cheap ad auctions. It cost almost nothing to pull off

🌟What Apple's hiding

We get into the weeds on Apple's new ""private"" filtering API. It's a total game-changer: we can now block ads without the software even knowing what site you're on. Total privacy, zero trade-offs

🌟DNS vs. VPN vs. Local filtering

If you've ever wondered whether you need all three and how they actually work together to crush trackers that browsers can't touch

Whether you're a full-blown privacy nerd or just someone who's tired of getting hit with pop-ups, this conversation is packed with ""aha"" moments. Henry and Andrey speak the same language: safety, freedom, and a cleaner Internet. It's one of the most honest and insightful interviews we've been a part of.

1ra0y3e,https://i.redd.it/9tj9qpq3lokg1.jpeg,The hospital visits…,"The hospital wing had a certain kind of quiet that didn’t feel empty, more like the building itself was holding its breath, giving people space to heal.

Lady Nagant, Kaina, sat propped up against her pillows with the window blinds half-open, letting in a stripe of late afternoon sun that painted warm lines across the sheets. The bandage wrap along her side was still fresh, and the faint ache of recovery lived in the way she moved carefully… but the tension that used to sit behind her eyes was different now.

Lighter.

Like something terrible had finally been unhooked from her ribs.

The first day Mark visited after Robin’s surgery, he’d stood in the doorway too long, hands hovering at his sides like he didn’t know what to do with them. Not because he was nervous about her, Mark had faced monsters and cosmic threats with a straight back and steady hands.

He was nervous because she was alive in a way she hadn’t been allowed to be.

Because for the first time in a long time, her body was finally hers.

Kaina had watched him take in the monitors, the IV line, the neatly folded hospital blanket at the foot of the bed, then his gaze landed on her, and his shoulders eased like he’d been holding a weight he didn’t want her to see.

“…Hey,” he’d said softly.

She’d stared at him a beat, then exhaled through her nose—something that almost wanted to be a laugh.

“You look like you’re about to apologize,” she’d murmured.

“I kind of am,” Mark admitted, stepping in. “For… how long you had to carry that. Alone.”

Kaina’s fingers had tightened around the sheet, just slightly. The old Kaina would’ve deflected. The old Kaina would’ve made a sharp comment and hidden behind it like armor.

But the thing about armor is, when you finally take it off, your skin remembers what air feels like.

“You didn’t put it there,” she’d said.

“No,” Mark replied. “But I’m here now.”

And he didn’t say it like a promise he wasn’t sure he could keep. He said it like a fact.

From that day on, he came every day.

Sometimes with flowers, simple ones, nothing fancy. Sometimes with a book he thought she might like, even if she pretended she wasn’t the type to read it. Sometimes he came with nothing but his hoodie pockets and that steady, warm presence that made the room feel less like a hospital and more like a place you could breathe.

At first, Kaina measured time by pain meds and vitals checks.

Then she started measuring it by Mark.

By the squeak of the door hinge. By the familiar rhythm of his knock, always two taps, never loud. By the way he’d lean in like he was entering a sacred place, not just a sterile room full of medical equipment.

“Day three,” she’d said once, eyes half-lidded. “You’re persistent.”

Mark had pulled the visitor chair closer, careful not to scrape the floor too loudly. “You’re alive. That’s worth being annoying about.”

“Annoying,” Kaina echoed, unimpressed.

He held up a drink bottle he’d brought. “Hydration.”

She narrowed her eyes. “Bribery.”

“Respectfully,” Mark said, twisting the cap open, “it’s both.”

It became a pattern, small, steady things. Mark didn’t push her to talk. He didn’t demand gratitude. He didn’t treat her like a tragic story that needed fixing.

He treated her like a person.

And Kaina, who had spent so long being used, pointed, discarded, didn’t know what to do with that at first.

The first time she smiled without meaning to, it surprised her.

It happened on a day she was frustrated, when the nurse insisted she take it slow, when her body felt like a locked door she couldn’t force open, when the old anger tried to curl around her throat again like smoke.

Mark had walked in with a paper bag and a look of exaggerated seriousness.

“I brought contraband,” he’d announced.

Kaina blinked. “You’re in a hospital.”

“That’s what makes it exciting.” He sat down and carefully revealed the treasure: a little pack of cafeteria pudding cups and a plastic spoon.

Kaina stared at it, then at him. “…That’s your contraband?”

Mark nodded gravely. “I took a risk. I could’ve been stopped.”

She let out a tiny sound, barely there at first, then it widened into a real laugh that startled her so much she pressed her knuckles to her mouth like she could hide it.

Mark’s eyes softened immediately, like he’d seen a light turn on.

“Hey,” he said, quieter now. “There it is.”

Kaina’s laughter faded into something warm and strange, something she hadn’t trusted in years.

“What?” she asked, defensive by instinct.

“That.” Mark gestured gently, not pointing at her scars, not pointing at her bandages, just pointing at her. “You.”

Kaina’s throat tightened, and she stared at the window for a moment too long.

“…Don’t get used to it,” she muttered.

Mark didn’t argue. He just smiled like he didn’t need to.

Days passed. The stitches healed. The bruising faded from angry purples to soft yellows. The monitors beeped less urgently. Kaina started sitting up longer, walking a few extra steps with help, complaining under her breath the entire time.

Mark made it a game.

“One more step,” he’d say, standing nearby like a human safety net.

Kaina would glare. “You say that every time.”

“Because it works every time.”

“It does not.”

“You literally just did it.”

She’d roll her eyes, but her mouth would twitch like she was fighting a smile.

And sometimes, when she was tired, when her guard slipped, she’d talk.

Not the big things at first. Not the sharp-edged memories. Just… pieces.

Her favorite kind of weather. The fact that she preferred bitter coffee. How silence didn’t always feel peaceful—it could feel like waiting for a bullet you couldn’t dodge.

Mark listened like it mattered, because it did.

And on one of those quieter evenings, when the sun was low and the hospital hallway lights hummed, Kaina finally said it—almost too small to hear.

“…I didn’t think it would ever stop.”

Mark didn’t pretend he didn’t know what she meant.

He leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. “I know.”

Kaina’s fingers twisted lightly in the blanket. “It felt like my body was a hostage.”

Mark’s voice was steady, but there was a heat under it, controlled, deliberate. “It was. And now it’s not.”

Kaina swallowed. “You really think I can just… live like normal?”

Mark didn’t give her a heroic speech. He didn’t promise it would be easy.

He just said, “I think you can live like you. And we can figure out what that looks like.”

Kaina stared at him. Really stared, like she was trying to find the trick, the angle, the lie.

But Mark didn’t have one. He was just there. Every day. Consistent. Safe.

The kind of presence that didn’t demand anything from you.

Eventually, Kaina started looking forward to the visits without hating herself for it.

She started saving questions. Little ones. Like, “What did you do today?” or “Did you actually sleep?” or “How many people are you carrying on your back right now, Mark?”

And Mark would answer honestly, even when the answer made him sound tired.

Somehow, that honesty made her feel less alone.

Then one morning, Kaina woke up before the nurses came in and realized something that made her chest feel oddly full:

The fear was quieter.

Not gone. Not erased.

But quieter.

And she knew exactly why.

Because she could count on two things now:

Her heartbeat.

And Mark showing up.

That afternoon, Kaina was halfway through a slow walk along the edge of her room, one hand on the rail, determination stitched into every step, when she heard the familiar two taps on the door.

She paused, breath catching, and tried to pretend it didn’t matter.

“Come in,” she called, voice steady.

The door opened.

Mark stepped into the room with his usual careful warmth, like he was trying not to bring the outside world’s chaos in with him.

Only this time, he had a small bakery box in his hands, held like it was precious.

Kaina’s eyes narrowed immediately. “What’s that.”

Mark’s smile was soft, almost shy. “I—uh. I brought something.”

He lifted the box slightly, and she caught the label on the side in neat, printed letters:

Cheesecake.

Kaina blinked, genuinely thrown off for a second.

“…Mark,” she warned, as if her voice could stop whatever kindness he was about to commit.

But he was already walking closer, the box balanced carefully in both hands, eyes on her like this was the easiest decision he’d made all day.

“I thought,” Mark said quietly, “we could celebrate something.”

Kaina’s throat tightened before she could stop it. “Celebrate what?”

Mark set the box down on the little table by her bed, slow, gentle, then looked up at her, warmth and certainty wrapped together.

“You,” he said. “Still being here.”

And as he reached to open the box—

The door clicked softly behind him.

Kaina’s gaze flicked past his shoulder, toward the hallway, toward the sliver of space where the outside world could still reach in.

For half a heartbeat, the room felt too quiet.

And Mark, still smiling, still focused on the cheesecake, didn’t notice it yet.

But Kaina did.

Because she’d learned what danger sounded like when it tried to hide.

And right then…

She heard it.

1ra0vov,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1ra0vov/my_life_is_an_endless_struggle_and_full_of_drama/,"My life is an endless struggle and full of drama, mixed with a little luck and love, and a dash of petty revenge.","Spoiler alert. Substances are mentioned, as well as abortion, which does not take place. The headline is not exaggerated.

Obviously, your story can only begin with your birth, but my complicated life actually began long before that. 
Grab a cookie, I'm 48 now and a lot has happened since a little boy, panicked by his father, climbed a tree with no branches on the lower part to hide in the treetops. And I'm telling you a lot of it. 

That little boy was my father, Frank (not his real name). Frank was one of five children and, for reasons I can no longer ascertain, his father's whipping boy. There didn't even have to be a reason, but if one of the five children was beaten, it was Frank.

I can only guess at the family dynamics, as it was never talked about, but at that time, the man was in charge and the woman had to obey. So I guess my grandmother didn't do much to help my father have a better life.
Why does my life begin with my father's story? I'll get to that in a moment.

Frank, as we discovered after his death, was gay. He was born in 1946, which was not the best time to be gay, especially with a father like his.
So he hid his true self, met my mother Kristin (fake name also) at a folk festival, and married her. The marriage was difficult from the start, which in retrospect seems completely logical, but no one except Frank knew that he was gay. 

I was told that they went to see a therapist, who said something fatal: Children save marriages.
Well, I find that more than questionable. Sleepless nights, spit stains on clothes, sacrifice for another person... None of that can repair a broken marriage that was doomed to fail from the start.
But that's where I come in, and if one child isn't enough to save the marriage, we'll just have another one, my brother.

Now I'm sure that my father never wanted children, and certainly not a wife. That's exactly how he behaved: he was unloving, uninterested, and preferred to spend time without us. 

I now know that I am a person who needs to be loved, and that's where the next tragedy begins. My father liked me more than my brother, and that was the case from birth. My mother, who both wanted and loved us children, resorted to the only means she could think of: she favored my brother. 
But that didn't balance things out. Being liked more by my father than my brother manifested itself in minimally less indifference and a tiny bit more friendliness. That's all.

Being favored by my mother, on the other hand, had so many advantages. I could give many examples of this, but the most significant one will have to suffice:
My parents built a house and my mother signed it over to my brother, paying me a small amount of money (she waived the same amount from my brother when he bought it and also charged a price that was a joke). Until her death, she thought that was fair. He gets everything, I get very little, and I have to be very grateful for that.

You can imagine how sad my childhood was under this circumstances. Even sadder is that my childish brain conjured up a perfect family idyll out of it.
Now I know that I am made to survive, and so is my psyche.
Sadly, I still need this ability to this day, and I don't think it will get any better in the future.

Before we get to the events that are closer to the present, I'll briefly tell you about my training as a medical assistant.
My boss was a hothead and an old-school man (men are top, women are there to make men's lives more pleasant).

But hey, being yelled at by him because the coffee wasn't ready on time is nothing compared to the drama with my colleague who trained me.
She was addicted to heroin and financed her addiction through prostitution. And as addicts are, she told me many lies. In her story, she was the poor victim, and my helper syndrome jumped right on board. Besides, I was very young and naive and had no experience with drug addicts. I was completely defenseless against her manipulation, and she took it really far. It was so bad that at one point I had a nervous breakdown and was so scared that I started crying in panic when I had to leave the house. 
My boss at the time and my parents did nothing to protect me. As always, I had to escape this situation on my own, and in the end I managed to do so.

My father left my mother when I was 14 years old. But not only that, he also left my brother and me. He moved out and didn't look back. It hurt me a lot, but over the years I learned to live with it.
In 2020, he died alone and lonely. He had heated up a cup of soup in the microwave and was dead before the timer went off. A neighbor found him, alerted the police, and they notified us. While clearing out his apartment, I found out that he was gay. His apartment was disgusting, with maggots and moths everywhere. He had Crohn's disease and had to take a lot of medication.

There was exactly one private contact in his cell phone, and when I called, that person slandered him.
He could have come out, could have had a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law and four grandchildren. I don't even know if he knew he had become a grandfather. 

My bitterness because my father didn't want me has gone and given way to pity. He is a victim of the time and society into which he was born, and wherever my incredible resilience comes from, it certainly didn't come from him.

My greatest wish since childhood was to start a family. I never dreamed of a career, but rather of getting married and having children. 
My first long-term relationship was with Philipp, and of course patterns repeat themselves. Philipp wasn't gay, which would have been a blessing, but he was the biggest narcissist you could imagine. My love-starved brain did what it was used to doing and covered up Philipp's lousy treatment with a lot of pink paint and glitter.

Fortunately, he cheated on me and left me after 4.5 years. But a man like him can't leave without retaining power over his ex. So he made it seem like we had a future and would definitely get married, but needed some space first. (He didn't tell me about the other girl, I found out later.)
Fortunately, that only worked for a short time, and I managed to break away from him and banish the asshole from my life.

I won't give this person any more space than necessary, but I can tell you that being with him caused me a lot of trauma, some of which I am still dealing with today.
A few months and a few dates with unremarkable men later, Kris (now m50, fake name) came into the picture.
To say that I won the lottery with this man would be an understatement.
He is everything I could ever want. Loving, funny, caring, responsible, and he truly loves me. Even though I often doubt whether others like me, I am sure of his love.
We got married in the seventh year of our relationship, and although the time before the wedding wasn't entirely without problems, looking back on my whole life, it was the best time I ever had.
With the phrase, “for better or for worse,” the bad times really began. If you thought my life had been difficult up to that point, now comes the real horror.

Shortly after our wedding, we found out that we couldn't have children naturally. I had problems, he had problems too, and after a few tests, it was clear that we needed ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) to have any chance at all. That's quite a lot of extra treatment, it carries risks for the woman and it's very expensive. I already mentioned my desire to have children, which has always been very strong, and Kris's desire was not much less. We are a typical bourgeois couple, in love, engaged, married, white picket fence, children…

Incorrect test results that were very poor, correct results that were even worse, constantly changing diagnoses that reduced the likelihood of success—the time before treatment was nerve-wracking. 
After long weeks of despair, the day of the embryo transfer finally arrived. I'll spare you the details, but it was so close that it could have been canceled.
Kris and I went to McDonald's after the transfer. Children love fast food, and we thought we'd show our potential child all the wonderful things in the world so that it would stay.

On the same day, I suddenly felt a slight pain in my abdomen. The doctor later confirmed that it was the embryo implanting. I was pregnant!
You can't imagine how happy we were. I was at work when I got the blood test results, and I cried so much with joy and relief that I couldn't work for an hour.

But my joy was short-lived. On the very day I reached week 5+0 of my pregnancy, at a time when many pregnant women don't even know they are expecting, the nausea began.
It wasn't morning sickness, it wasn't even the nausea we all know from gastrointestinal infections. To this day, I still can't find the words to describe the horror I experienced. 

The nausea was a 20 on a scale of 1-10. I threw up up to 40 times a day. Everything triggered vomiting. Touch, noise, smells (sunshine has a smell!!!), movement. I lost 9 kg in the first five weeks of my pregnancy. I couldn't get out of bed anymore and could only climb stairs on all fours. I was in such bad shape that I considered terminating the pregnancy, even though I wanted this child more than anything else in the world. 

I was in the hospital several times, and my husband gave me IVs at home, even though he doesn't even have a medical background.
What I experienced is called hyperemesis gravidarum, and I had the worst form of it.
To this day, I still don't know how I managed to endure such an unbearable situation until the birth, because that's how long it lasted. It was so bad that parts of that time were completely erased from my memory by my psyche.

The birth was the next horror; our son almost died during it. I don't want to go to much into the details but to save my son's life, an emergency C-section had to be performed. At least the nausea was over. By the time of the birth, I had forgotten what it felt like to feel normal. 

Suddenly, I was myself again and had the opposite of PPD. I was on a happiness high. My love for my husband was already great, but my love for our son topped everything.

But not everything was back to normal. I was in pain every day, especially in my legs. It was so bad that I could only walk slowly, like an old woman, only now with a baby who was high maintenance because he had problems. Problems that still exist today and will accompany him throughout his life.

We decided to have a second child. I knew the hyperemesis would return, but I was prepared and determined to get through it a second time. Holy amnesia, without it, it wouldn't have been possible. 
The second attempt at ICSI worked immediately. There were complications again, but we achieved the miracle of having two children in two attempts. That's really rare, and even our doctor was very surprised.

As expected, I felt sick again during the hole pregnancy, but this time I had the right medication in time and was at least able to take care of my son.
This child also had to be delivered by C-section, but I didn't care. The main thing was that the child was fine.
Finally, our family was complete. Our daughter was healthy and an attentive, sweet little thing from day one.
My husband's and my greatest wish had come true. BUT! As I mentioned before, I am probably made/forced to survive, because fate dealt us another blow. 
Our little daughter had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance when she was 9 days old. She had a lumbar puncture and was hospitalized for over a week. In the end, everything turned out fine, but those days in the hospital were horrific for us. 

And the pain I had already mentioned did not subside. I became increasingly immobile over time. My 35-year-old self was stuck in an 80-year-old body.
No doctor took me seriously; as a woman, you are often labeled as hysterical. Especially when you have a history like mine, with two pregnancies like I had, these problems must be psychological. So I was sent to a psychiatrist who, fortunately, had also studied general medicine. 

She confirmed that I am neither hysterical nor depressed, but on the contrary, have an incredibly good and healthy way of dealing with misfortunes. She diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.

From the day my son was born, pain was my constant companion. Nothing could ease it, and I respond very little or not at all to painkillers.
You need to move more, said an orthopedist and pain specialist.

So I did. I walked for hours with the stroller, played with my children, did the housework, and tried to ignore the pain. But it didn't get any better. The more I moved, the stiffer I became and the stronger the pain got.

Sometimes I could barely make it up the stairs.
So that was my new life. Inside, I was young, but I was stuck in a body that no longer functioned, and yet I never lost my will to live or my joy in life.
I fought every day and was very aware of it. I was also aware that I would continue to fight.
Fortunately, I didn't know at the time how much more I would have to fight.

The children grew older, and our son developed more and more problems. We visited many doctors, but they didn't take us seriously. Again! 
Eventually, a doctor misinterpreted something and sent us to a specialist. From then on, there was a barrage of bad news and endless diagnoses.
All the names are false, and I'm not even writing in my native language, but I will still protect my son and not reveal any details. Suffice it to say that he needed a lot of therapy, and I needed the strength to take him there. When the offices were on the first floor and there was no elevator, I could only make it up the stairs with my last ounce of strength.

My husband has always supported me, but he had to work full-time and often didn't have the time. He did take time off to help out when I needed it, but that wasn't always possible.
He's a great husband but an even better father. I can hardly believe my luck to have him by my side.

The years passed, and then the VID arrived. On March 29, 2021, I woke up feeling a little under the weather. It wasn't serious, but I went to a testing center and the test came back positive.
In our country, you had to isolate yourself at that time, so that's what I did. I was separated from my family for two weeks and spent my time in my bedroom. My symptoms were mild, barely a sniffle. My biggest problem was missing my family and feeling bored alone in the tiny room I was stuck in.

After two weeks, I had to go back to the testing center to get tested again.
When I put my pants on, I was completely out of breath and had to sit down before I could walk to the car.
On the drive to the testing center, I couldn't keep my eyes on the road and couldn't explain why. 
The walk from the parking lot to the center was exhausting, and so was waiting in line. I broke out in a sweat and was breathing as if I had run a marathon. I was about to pass out.
Somehow I made it back to the car and had to rest before I could drive home.
Luckily, I didn't have an accident, but the drive back was also difficult. I kept catching myself looking at my surroundings instead of paying attention to the road.

From that day on, my life was over for the time being. I was bedridden for two years, unable to concentrate, unable to tolerate light or noise, and therefore lay alone in a dark room all day. I had pain in my chest and felt as if an elephant were sitting on it. I had no energy left for even the most basic tasks; when I showered every six weeks or so, I had to recover from it for a day. 

I could only walk 50 meters before I had to lie down for a day, sometimes even longer. I was too weak to lift a fork to my mouth. I couldn't concentrate anymore; even the easy question of what I wanted to eat overwhelmed me. 

My head hurt every day, my eyes burned and my pulse was 120-140bpm when lying down. When I slept, I woke up feeling even worse than before. 
I forgot things that can only be forgotten. Questions I asked my husband, why I entered a room or that I entered it at all, I even forgot how to breathe and had to actively remind myself to do so. 
I could no longer work, no longer drive a car, I no longer laughed. I was dead, my body just forgot to die.

Everything I write sounds like absolute horror, but at the same time far too banal to really describe my condition.
My physical condition was one thing, but accepting what had become of my life was an even greater struggle. And the isolation! Can you imagine lying in a dark room for two years with no contact with anyone? Not being able to take care of my children? Not being able to shower? Not feeling any joy anymore?

Nevertheless, I did not give up. I fighted.
I discovered that there is a large group of people affected by long Covid on Twitter, and there was a lot of discussion there. Therapies and medications were recommended, and I was fortunate once again that two medications (out of countless I tried) worked very well for me.

After two years, things slowly started to improve. Bit by bit, I got my life back. I can laugh again, my symptoms have lessened, I can tolerate light and noise, I can shower, my brain is working again...
And the fighter in me continues to fight. 
Two years ago, I found a job in my field that I can do from home. At first, it was just a mini-job, 3 to 7 hours a week max. Then I was able to work part-time, first 20 hours, then 25, 27, and now 30 hours a week. I love my job and am grateful every day for this opportunity.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still seriously ill compared to healthy people. I can walk 500 meters, a little more on good days. I can cook when I'm sitting at the table and work when I'm sitting in bed. I still spend most of my time in bed and am barely physically capable, but I have something resembling quality of life again. I survived an assessor who psychologically abused me, I survived rehabilitation that I was too weak for but was forced to attend anyway. I have experienced gaslighting from doctors, family, friends, and strangers, and I survived that too.
I, or rather my reasonably good condition, am dependent on medication. When it stops working, I am completely ill again. 

But I keep fighting. I continue to survive blows of fate such as the death of my parents, my in-laws' serious illness, emergency surgery because my gallbladder almost burst, ablation on my heart because I had a minor heart defect, and all this while I am seriously ill. 
I have to pay dearly for all the happiness I have, but I wouldn't want to be without my husband and children for anything in the world.

And now I would be super grateful if you could keep your fingers crossed for me so that I can fulfill a wish I've had my whole life. 
I want to publish my own book. I've already written it, it just needs to be proofread. Unfortunately, the people who promised to read it haven't done so yet, even though they've had a year to do so. But I am determined to hold this book in my hands in paper form someday.
In it, I settle the score with my ex, so it's partly based on true events, and I've made him out to be the villain. The petty queen in me celebrated every second of it.

My life sucks, but I'm not giving up, and I love being alive. I love my family, my job, and I'll fight as long as I have to.

I wont be taking these classes forever. A few more months maybe. I really want to get to know him but I know it'll have to be me that asks him out because I doubt he would make the first move. I want to ask him later, maybe right before the classes end, if he'd be willing to get a coffee or something. But I've never asked a man out and considering he is a ""teacher"" to me (not really, this isnt some accreditated place and these could be considered ""hobby"" classes) i am terrified of being rejected. TERRIFIED.

 If I don't ask him out.. I feel like i never take initiative on who I like and always wait to be asked out and it never happens. This year was supposed to be my year of making the first move and learning to accept rejection and being sexy and free after a long relationship ended and I feel liberated. But I'm liberated because I spend all my time thinking about this stupid crush. Send help. Do I wait for it to fade somehow or just go and be ballsy and ask him out?

**Chapter Four – Movement**

*Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams*  
*Telling myself it’s not as hard, hard, hard as it seems*  
— Led Zeppelin, “Going to California” (1971)  


  


  
  
I love flying. I really do. But let’s be honest: a hundred and fifty nautical miles in a straight line isn’t the most exciting thing. With clear skies, good planning, and obvious landmarks, all I had to do was hold a heading and wait for the turn points. Easier said than done, sure, but the trick is to stay ahead of the flight plan.

Complacency can kill a pilot faster than you can say “oh shit,” and staying sharp when your mind wants to drift is half the battle.

I’d been tooling along for a little more than an hour. With visibility this good and my checkpoints clicking by, I was getting close, not close enough to see the field yet, but getting there. For me, this is always the most stressful part of flying to a new airport. You’d think spotting a runway from the air would be easy. It isn’t. They blend into the landscape like fly poop in the pepper. Invisible until you’re practically on top of them.

In the new world, though, it wasn’t the same kind of pressure. No controllers, no restricted airspace, no FAA waiting to pull my ticket. I could afford to be a little sloppy, just bop along until the field showed itself. The only one keeping score was me.

About ten minutes later, I got lucky. A tower poked just above the horizon. It didn’t mean it was my tower, I couldn’t see the runways yet, but the landmarks lined up. I checked my kneeboard: a gentle right turn to two-five-zero would put me on a straight line for midfield.

Even though the radios had been quieter than a golf clap, habit was habit. I twisted the COMM 1 frequency to one-one-eight-point-two-five, the ATIS frequency I’d scribbled down the night before.

I couldn’t tell you what ATIS stood for, actually, pretty sure the A was Airport and the I was Information. The rest? Who cares. “You git what you git and don’t throw a fit,” as my mom liked to say.

I was still chewing on that thought when my eyes snapped from the horizon to the radio stack, my jaw dropping.

“…sed. Winds calm, runways clear. Fuel: Jet A and avgas, free. First come, first served. Friendly…  
Mansfield Regional Airport, Information Alpha, one-two-three-zero Zulu.  
Tower closed. Winds calm, runways clear. Fuel: Jet A and avgas, free. First come, first served. Friendly…  
Mansfield Regional Airport, Informa—”

ATIS rolled through my headset, clear as a church bell knelling on Sunday morning. I let it repeat, stunned. Friendly. Maybe the most beautiful word in the English language. But was it true?

Since winds were calm and my heading change had me on two-five-zero degrees, I was more or less on a straight line for Runway Five. I hadn’t seen another plane in the sky for ten days. Still, rules were rules. I dialed the tower frequency, one-one-nine-point-eight, into COMM2 and hit the SWAP button to switch from ATIS to Tower. Then I pressed the transmit button on my yoke and broadcast, “Mansfield Regional, November Niner-Zero-Four-Alpha-Lima, with ATIS, ten miles out, straight in, full stop, Runway Five, Mansfield.”

I released the transmit button and, just like back when the world made sense, I heard the reply: “Niner-Zero-Four-Alpha-Lima, straight in, cleared to land, Runway Five.” My original plan called for a midfield entry with a low, slow flyover to check things out. But with the warm ATIS greeting and a clearance to land, I decided to let my guard down for the first time in almost a month. If smiles were miles, it would’ve taken a week to walk across my face. I flipped to my landing checklist and started my routine.

The ramp looked abandoned at first glance, dust-coated windscreens, weeds pushing through cracked asphalt. But the FBO door was propped open, a scrap of cardboard taped to the glass: “Come in if you’re friendly.”

Inside, the place had the feel of a clubhouse frozen mid-day. Charts were pinned to a corkboard, a stack of sectionals lay forgotten, and on the wall, in a place of honor behind the counter, hung a framed print of Snoopy atop his bright red doghouse. Leather helmet snug, goggles on, blue scarf streaming straight back, fists clenched like a World War I Flying Ace. In the corner of the print was a neat, looping signature: Charles M. Schulz.

An old man sat beneath the print, maps spread out like he’d been planning a trip he’d never take. A revolver rested near his hand, though he didn’t reach for it. At his feet, a cardboard box rustled and squeaked: a hound nuzzled a tumble of pups, all ears and bellies.

“Born just before the flu got loose,” he said when he caught me looking. “Twelve, maybe fourteen weeks now. ’Bout ready to leave the box. Momma’s immune, obviously. Don’t know about the dad. There were six, now there’s only three, and they had a rough go.”

He glanced down at the pups, one of them stretched against the others. “But I think they’ll make it. Haven’t seen any other dogs. No vets for shots. Don’t know what that’s gonna mean, if anything.”

In the corner of the room, an old pot on a battered hot plate burbled away, spilling aromatic steam from fresh coffee. It was plugged into a mess of wires that snaked back to an APU cart: a squat, battery-heavy rig that hummed faintly, its orange cord coiled like a sleeping snake. No generator racket, no fuel smell, just the quiet presence of a man who knew how to make things work. The same setup, I suspected, had kept the radios cooking long after all the others had gone silent.

I approached the desk with my hands visible and asked, “You my ATC, the voice of ATIS?”

“That I am,” came the Midwestern drawl. “Charlie Brown. This is my place, ATIS is only on when the sun’s out.”

“Nice to meet you,” I said, sticking out my hand. “Name’s Brad Mears.”

There was a pause, but he grabbed a rag, wiped his hand, and shook mine.

“It’s been more than a few days since I’ve met a friendly face,” I said, studying him, trying to gauge just how friendly he might be. “Sure seems quiet. Anybody else buzzing the pattern?”

His eyes widened a bit, like the Blue Angels had done a flyby the day before.

“Son, you’re the first person to land here in more’n ten days. I lost count a few back. Had a couple departures, though, the last was a good friend of mine, Jim Hart. Flew himself a nice little doctor-killer Bonanza.

“He looked sick. Bad sick. I’m ashamed to say I didn’t get too close, but truth be told, he looked awfully tube-neck. I asked him, ‘Jim, where you think you’re going?’ He coughed, wiped the gunk from around his mouth, and just said, ‘West.’ That was it.”

“I tossed him the keys to my fuel truck. Told him, ‘Take old Bessie, fill your ride, leave the keys under the mat. I’ll walk over and git her after you’re gone.’”

“A few minutes later he took off like it was any other Tuesday. Even made the radio calls.” Charlie shook his head. “Only problem was, he sounded like shit, voice all ragged, coughing between words. ‘Bonanza Four-Seven-X-Ray, taking two-six, westbound,’ like anybody was still listening. Gave me the chills, hearing him call it like the world wasn’t already gone.”

“He was the second-to-last person I’ve seen, until you.”

“Over there, she was third. Walked in little more’n a week ago.” He nodded toward a young woman I hadn’t noticed when I came in.

“This here’s Kathryn but she goes by Katie,” he said. “She’s been helpin’ me since. But I worry about keepin’ her safe. Got my wits, sure, just not the strength anymore. And there’s no one left out here to trust.”

As Charlie finished, one of the pups scrambled out of the box, wiggled a beeline to the girl, and plopped down at her feet as if to challenge his assertion.

The man looked at me, sizing me up, then flicked his eyes toward the teenager standing in the shadows. Sixteen, maybe seventeen, mud-streaked jeans, old hoodie, hair pulled back in a tangle. She didn’t say a word, just stood there with her arms crossed, posture guarded.

Katie’s eyes met mine for a moment, curious, suspicious, but sharp.

“This is Darwin,” she said, scooping the puppy into her arms. “That one’s Jasmine, we call her Jazzy. The other is Sage. Momma’s Poco.”

I let it hang in the still air of the office and turned back to Charlie.

“If Hart was second and Katie was third,” I said, motioning toward the girl, “who was first?”

“I don’t much like talking about that one,” Charlie said, then went on anyway. “Didn’t do nothing to me, but he just felt wrong. Walked the ramp like he owned it, fiddled with a couple of planes. When he saw me watching, I shut and locked my door, first time I ever did that in the daytime. Skinny guy, blue jeans, Levi’s jacket covered in buttons, cowboy boots. No real reason, but he gave me the creeps. When I got my nerve back and opened the door, he was gone. Like he’d never been there.”

Katie had drifted closer, Darwin clutched to her chest. From the way she leaned in, I figured Charlie had never told her that story before.

Charlie shivered a bit, shrugged his shoulders, and, in an attempt to lighten the mood, shifted gears. “So here I am: Charlie Brown, a beagle, and a box of pups. And like she said, Poco. Snoopy was a boy dog.”

Katie smirked at that, like it was an inside joke.

She edged closer, the pup squirming in her arms until she was only a handshake away. I reached out to scratch behind his ears, but he answered with a playful nip, a mouthful of razor-sharp puppy teeth.

I jerked my hand back. “Youch! Little Mr. Needle Teeth. Momma must be about ready to wean him.”

“Ayuh,” Charlie said. “Started ’em on puppy chow the day before Katie walked in. She’s the one that named the pups.”

I turned to Katie. “Why Darwin?”

“Charles Darwin,” she said, matter-of-fact. “You know, the survival-of-the-fittest guy. Seemed right. And the ship he sailed on, The HMS Beagle.”

She cracked the smallest smile. “It just fits.”

With the nice-ta-meetchas out of the way, silence settled in, awkward, but not unfriendly. Charlie broke it first.

“Where you off to, young fella? Got yourself a plan? You’re welcome to top your tanks if you want. Never met a pilot who’d turn down a bellyful of free gas.”

“I’m heading west,” I said.

Katie’s head snapped toward me, eyes narrowing. I caught the body language, it felt like a sheet of ice had dropped between us, and hurried to add, “I’m looking for a crop-dustin’ strip somewhere in the middle of Nebraska. Truth is, I don’t even know why.”

Charlie’s eyes flicked from me to Katie, then back again. “There’s west,” he said slowly, “and then there’s WEST. Why don’t we sit down and palaver on it.”

Charlie waved me over to a battered old desk, reaching for a pair of chipped mugs on a shelf behind him while steam curled up from the pot in the corner. He poured with the kind of care only an old man has, sliding one toward me like we’d been neighbors for years. Then he pushed over a tin of sugar with a spoon propped inside and said, “Sorry, no cream. Hope you like it black.”

Then, wonder of wonders, he reached into a dorm-sized fridge and pulled out a can of Coke. With a flick of the wrist, he lobbed it to Katie. She snagged it one-handed, Darwin still tucked in the crook of her arm.

We gathered around the table, staring at a set of marked-up sectionals. It was clear Charlie had been chewing on the same idea I was chasing.

I looked him in the eye. “You a pilot, Charlie?”

He nodded, slow. “Yeah. Was. Lost my medical years ago, blood pressure too high, eyes not what they used to be. Hung up my headsets five, maybe six years back. Since then I’ve only ridden right seat. I could fly if I had to, but truth is, the thought of it scares the piss outta me.”

Katie’s eyes bounced between us. No telling what was running through her head, but if I had to guess, she was sketching her own ideas about what came next. I tried to catch her eye, but she looked away.

As she did, Darwin wriggled out of her arms, padded across the table, sniffed my hand, then gave me the look, that unmistakable dog look that said pet me. I obliged, scratching behind his ears. Charlie slid something under the table without a word, a strip of beef jerky.

I held it in front of Darwin’s nose, and it disappeared before I could say, “Who’s a good boy?”

Charlie leaned over the map, tapping a thick finger at a penciled line running west across Ohio. “Been marking this up for weeks. Keeps changing depending on the weather I feel. Just a way to pass the time. Never really figured I’d fly it myself.”

His eyes flicked up to mine. “But looks like somebody might. Would I be wrong in thinking you’ve got something that looks like this in your Skyhawk?”

“You wouldn’t be wrong,” I said, holding his gaze. He might’ve been getting on in years, but his marbles were still rolling on the right track.

Katie stayed quiet, sipping her Coke, arms folded now that Darwin had defected to my side of the table. For a kid, she already seemed to know when it was best to listen and when to talk, a skill plenty of people never learn, me included.

“Okay,” I said. “For now, I don’t want to get into why I want to go where I want to go, but I’m heading for a place called Hemingford Home, Nebraska.”

I rifled through the sectionals and, without surprise, found the right chart. What did surprise me was that Hemingford Home was circled in bright red ink, a perfect ring from a fine-point marker. I looked up from the map and saw Charlie staring right at me, hard. Katie’s gaze flicked between us like she was watching a ping-pong match, not two old guys hunched over a map.

Charlie leaned over the map, tracing the red-circled line with his finger. “Straight shot west’s longer than you think.”

“I know,” I said, already measuring the distance in my head. “I’m not exactly sure where this strip is, Hemingford Home’s the name I’ve got, but on the map it’s just a dot in the middle of nothing. Closest real airport I can pin down is ONL, smack in the middle of Nebraska, about seven hundred fifty nautical miles.”

“A clean line would be MFD-RPJ-SKI-ONL, then hunt around for Hemingford Home. I could do it in a day. Back when, I would’ve done it in a day. But now? I’d rather plan a stop in the middle. I don’t want to sweat fuel, and if I’m not lying, I never liked marathon legs anyway. But the way things are, the fewer the stops, the fewer the chances of running into the wrong people. It’s a toss-up.”

“What do you think, Charlie?”

Charlie rubbed at his jaw, eyes still on the chart. He traced the line once more, then set the pencil down. “Your math checks out. That’s about right.”

He leaned back, frowning a little. “If it were me, I’d keep the tanks full, just in case. Aim for the small fields, less chance of trouble. Fuel’s the least of your worries.”

He paused, thumb sliding along the penciled route. “But here’s what I can’t shake, the sky oughta have a few planes in it. There’s a lot of airplanes sitting in hangars across this country. Farmers, dentists, weekend flyers. Some of ’em had to make it, same as you.”

His gaze drifted past me. “And yet… it’s quiet. Too quiet. Either folks never tried, or they did and didn’t make it far.” He shook his head once, slow. “What gets me is, we’ve got the tools. The whole sky wide open. Yet here we sit, like it’s just you, me, and the girl.”

Darwin seemed to take exception to the exclusion, letting out a sharp “yip” at the end of Charlie’s speech, catching us all off guard with a much-needed break in the rising tension.

Katie hadn’t said a word through all of this, but I could tell she was listening. When she finally spoke, it wasn’t about maps.

“Charlie, you’ve been good to me, and we’ve talked about me being safe here. But you’re the one who keeps saying it’s not really safe, especially for me, not with just the two of us.” She waved toward the window, toward the world outside. “And out there? That’s even worse. A girl alone? Forget it. Women’s lib died with the Tube-Neckers.”

She pulled Darwin closer, burying her face in his fur for a beat before looking up again. “And you keep saying you’re staying put. That you don’t want to be a burden.” She shifted in her chair, the words coming out rougher than she meant. “But… come on, Charlie. Feels like you’ve just been waiting for somebody to show up. What’s with the radio stuff anyway? That’s not a ray gun to keep the bad guys away, kinda the opposite.”

Her voice hung in the still air, daring one of us to break it.

It was my turn to look into the eyes of my new friends. Until that moment, Charlie and Katie had seemed like a matched set, salt and pepper shakers. I hadn’t really thought about adding someone to my travel plans. It wasn’t a hard decision, but I wanted to lighten the mood.

“So long as Darwin comes too, I’d be honored to have a co-pilot.”

I looked to Charlie. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes carried the weight of it. I made a quiet promise to talk with him alone before the girl and I departed. Katie, though, was beaming.

Careful what you wish for, young lady, I thought. Truth was, the two of them were set up pretty well here.

With that settled, all that was left was planning. The light through the hangar windows had shifted to amber, and I realized we weren’t going anywhere tonight. Tomorrow would be soon enough.

“I’d planned to take off for the next leg,” I said, looking at them both. “But with all this talking, it’s too late to start a three-hour cross-country to a place I’ve never been. No nav aids, no real need to rush. We’ll push off in the morning after a good night’s rest. That work for you, Katie?”

Katie pulled Darwin closer, then let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “Yeah… morning works.”

For the first time since we’d met, her voice carried something other than suspicion, almost relief.

I nodded. “That’s our plan, then. I need to talk airplane stuff with Charlie. Why don’t you start pulling together supplies for Darwin? We’ll be out on the ramp.”

Charlie gave me a knowing look and headed for the door. I followed, leaving Katie moving through the little FBO office, gathering a go-bag for herself and the pup.

He was already standing by my left wingtip when I caught up.

“Hey, Charlie,” I said. “I really didn’t see any of that coming. You know, I’ve got four seats.”

He looked at me and let out a slow sigh. “I’m too old for adventures. Don’t much care for being alone, but…” He paused, frowning in thought. “Here’s something I didn’t share in there. We both know you’re not staying in Nebraska for long. I’m not even sure why you’re going. I don’t think the old lady’s there anymore. And if I’m being honest, I think you know that too.”

He let the words hang, then added softly, “So why go to Nebraska at all?”

His question stopped me. I didn’t want to hand him the whole truth, so I said, “Because she told me to. I don’t know why. I’ve never been a spiritual kind of person, but it feels like maybe there’s something bigger at work. Not that I’m anything special, it just seems like there’s a reason. I just don’t know what it is.”

“Ya know,” Charlie said, “I’ve been told if I go anywhere, it oughta be Boulder, Colorado. But for some reason, I think I need to stay here a while longer. Like you, I’ve got no idea why. But that seems like my role.”

“Boulder,” I replied.

“Yup.” He didn’t blink. “And don’t think for a second I don’t know that’s where you’re heading after Nebraska, neither.”

He caught my eyes and held them, steady, unblinking, daring me to look away.

And in a flurry I hadn’t seen coming, I spilled everything. I didn’t know this guy from Adam, but somehow one look from him and it all came pouring out.

When I finished, he just stepped forward and hugged me. The man actually hugged me.

I pulled back, and he said, “Go find your girls, son. Godspeed.”

Then, after a pause: “How much you gonna tell the girl?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Feels like she’s got her own story. I’ll just have to see how it plays out. New world, man… strange new world.”

I glanced toward the door. Katie was standing there, watching, measuring.

We broke apart with a silent nod and turned back toward the office. Charlie went in first. As I passed, Katie tugged my wrist and whispered, “What the heck was that about? Never seen two guys hug, except my dad and uncle.”

“Charlie’s sad to see you and Darwin go,” I told her. “But he knows he needs to stay. At least for a little while.”

Charlie cobbled together a light supper from his stores, canned chili warmed on the hot plate, a loaf of bread a little stale but still good when toasted. He moved with the quiet efficiency of a man who’d lived alone too long, setting three mismatched plates like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Katie slid into a chair, Darwin curled at her feet. After a few bites she looked up and asked, “You know how to play backgammon?” Her tone carried that mix of challenge and curiosity only a teenager can manage.

I smirked. “Yeah, I know the game.”

“Good,” she said, already pulling a worn board from under the counter. “Charlie cheats.”

Charlie chuckled, shaking his head. “Girl can’t handle losin’ is all.”

The game gave the evening a rhythm, dice clacking, pips sliding, the kind of normalcy that felt almost obscene after weeks of silence. She beat me two out of three, and only a lucky run of doubles saved me in the third.

I asked if she played chess. She shook her head. “No.”

I thanked my stars, because if she did, I had a feeling I’d lose that one too. Sharp kid, no doubt about it.

For a while, the three of us could almost pretend things were normal. But by full dark I said I was going to try for some sleep. I wanted an early start. Katie claimed the couch, Darwin waddled back to his box, and Charlie had a cot in back. I spread my sleeping bag on the floor after he tossed me a couple of blankets to wad into a pillow.

I thought sleep would be hard, but like the night before, it came fast, dreamless, thankfully.

Sometime in the middle of the night I woke. Charlie’s faint snore drifted from the back office. Katie was out cold on the couch, Darwin curled beside her, nose tucked under her arm. I stepped outside to water the flowers. When I came back, her posture had changed. She twitched in her sleep, murmuring. One word slipped out:

“Queen.”

Darwin stirred, licked her cheek, gave a soft whine, then settled again.

I lay back down, wondering why she was dreaming about queens. Next thing I knew, I was blinking into first light.

Not surprisingly, Charlie had beaten me to it. He was already outside the office door, hands on hips, staring west. When I joined him, he didn’t look away.

“I don’t like those clouds,” he said. “Seen it before, plenty of times. You might make your first stop, but after that, all bets are off. This is tornado season. You’re flying straight into Twister Alley. If it were me, I’d stay put another day… or bump south, then west.”

I stood beside him, eyeing the line of weather rolling toward us. I nodded. No way I was arguing with a man who’d been reading skies longer than I’d been flying. And I couldn’t shake Mother Abagail’s warning: The sky won’t always be kind. Not tomorrow… maybe the next. Watch for the change. Be careful.

“Let’s bust out the charts. We’ll plan a new route.”

While Katie slept the way only teenagers can, Charlie and I spread maps across the desk. Based on his experience, we drew a line angling south, as far as St. Louis, then west again.

“Figure an hour after crossing the Mississippi, find a place to land,” he advised. “Keep your eyes open. Only fly when it’s clear. These storms can gather fast. You don’t want to be hunting a runway if the ceiling drops.”

With the new route set, Charlie walked over to the couch, gave Katie’s feet a light slap, and said, “Up you get, girl, day’s a-wastin’.”

He shuffled back to what passed for a pantry and came out with breakfast fixings: oatmeal, toast, and, best surprise of the morning, a frosty can of concentrated orange juice pulled from the dorm-room freezer. He mixed it with cold water and slid us each a glass.

While we ate, I explained the change in flight plans. Katie barely reacted, which left me unsure whether to be flattered or insulted. I mentioned this to Charlie, and he chuckled. “She’s leaving that part up to you. Path don’t matter, just that she gets there.”

He was probably right. Why was I always the last one to get it?

Breakfast finished, the mood turned awkward. It was time to go. I loaded the Skyhawk with our gear, Katie’s things, my kit, and the essentials for Darwin. Then I turned to her.

“No bathroom on this ride. Even if you don’t gotta go, now’s the time.”

She blushed, slipped away, and left me with Charlie. I thanked him for everything. He shook my hand, pulled me into a brief hug, and said, “Tailwinds and blue skies. Take care of the girl, and that little pup. Maybe we’ll meet again.”

The lump in my throat surprised me. Hard to believe it could hurt this much to leave a man I’d only just met.

Katie came back around the corner, went straight to Charlie, and gave him a fierce hug and a quick kiss on the cheek. “Thank you for everything,” she said, then gathered up Darwin and crossed to the right side of the Skyhawk. She climbed in like she belonged there.

I gave Charlie one last handshake, a casual salute, and climbed into the pilot’s seat. Preflight was already done; all that remained was the startup checklist.

I glanced over at Katie. “Ever been up in a small plane before?”

She shook her head, clutching Darwin in her lap, nervous and excited all at once.

“Ever flown on an airliner?”

She nodded.

“Big difference,” I told her. “In this one you’ll feel everything, every bump, every move. Don’t let it spook you. It all works the same way.”

I walked her through the headset and mic, then asked, “Ready?”

She nodded again, eyes wide.

“Good. Hold Darwin tight. He’s not going to love the noise.”

I flipped on the master switch and the intercom, tapped the earcup. “Testing… can you hear me?”

“Yes,” came her small but steady reply.

“Okay then. Time to go.”

I ran through the engine-start checklist, everything green. Outside, Charlie was walking back to the office as I cracked the window and called, “Clear prop!” before turning the key.

The Lycoming coughed, then caught, a smooth, throaty roar that filled the cabin. Katie’s eyes widened, tracking every move I made, bright and intent. As the alternator spooled up, I switched on the radios, hoping for one last goodbye from Charlie as we climbed out.

I noted the windsock hanging limp and thought, No-rules day again, then taxied toward the nearest runway.

“Mansfield Regional, November Niner-Four-Alpha-Lima taking Runway Two-Six, Mansfield.”

“Four-Alpha-Lima, cleared for takeoff. Good luck. Fly safe,” came Charlie’s reply over the radio.

“Four-Alpha-Lima rolling. Thank you, Charlie. God willing, we’ll meet again.”

Everything in the green. I glanced at Katie, “Here we go, lights, camera, action.”

I pushed the throttle full forward, held right rudder against the P-factor, and started the takeoff roll. “Airspeed alive,” I called into the mic as the needle crept upward. At fifty-five knots I eased back on the yoke, and the wheels broke free of the earth.

Climbing through five hundred feet, I banked in a slow circle over the field. Charlie had stepped outside the FBO, hand raised in a wave. Katie leaned toward the window, waving back. I dipped the wings in a gentle wag, then rolled out and pointed the nose south, climbing steady.

“St. Louis,” I said into the headset. “Here we come.”

Twenty or thirty miles southwest of Mansfield, I happened to glance down and caught the charred but distinct outline of a V-tail Bonanza, nose-down in a field. From our altitude I couldn’t make out the tail number, but only one conclusion fit: Mr. Hart, and his case of the Super Flu, had ended in a fiery finale.

I kept it to myself and didn’t point it out to Katie.

Naku Ardham kavatledhu bro, men’s perspective please","I’m trying to understand a situation with a coworker in my office. We sit in the same open workspace but quite far apart. In the beginning, I was actually the one who first made eye contact because I noticed he looked handsome. Since then (about 2–3 weeks), there has been repeated mutual eye contact, but no actual conversation.

\- Sometimes he looks when I’m not looking and quickly looks away when I notice.

\-I look at him quite often and he caught me multiple times. 

\- one day he didn’t even look at me at all, I think he ignored me most of the time and next day he changed his sit kinda far but, I was looking for him in his usual seat, and when I glanced around, he was already looking at me and smiling. then he glanced multiple times towards me, or peaks here and there.

\-  2 days ago i was with my team near the coffee and he does look at me glances no smiles and all and while walking away he turned back he see me he gave a long look and turned walked away

\- today I didn’t sit facing his side and he came towards my side for going to the coffee he looked at me and I looked away and looked at him and he kept looking while walking.

Because the signals feel mixed, I’m confused whether this usually indicates mild interest/curiosity, or someone just enjoying attention without intending anything.

1ra0rli,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ra0rli,India needs more citizens to dominate the server in WarEra. We are building a Superpower and need YOU.,"Helloo everyone, 
we are trying to get the Indian community in WarEra.io, it's a geopolitical strategy MMO where players run countries, economies, and armies. Rn, the server is evolving fast. Other countries are forming massive alliances, establishing distinct economies, and taking territory. India has massive potential in-game due to our numbers, but we need more active citizens to actually become a global superpower.

This is NOT a promotion of the game, it's not Pay-to-Win. As you all can see in the image, we are not even top 10 in terms of active population many small/low population countries have more players than us.

WarEra is a browser-based (and mobile app) geopolitical simulator (maybe RTS too). It’s not a graphics-heavy shooter, it’s about Strategy, Politics, and Economy. It's a simplified, community driven and played in real-time with hundreds of other people.

Real Politics: We have our own elections. You can run for President, become a minister of Defense, or manage the country's tax rates or even pass laws as a member of Parliament.
 
War & Territory: We defend our real-world borders and can expand into neighboring regions. (Yes, we can conquer. Yes, it is satisfying. Yes, we've made Akhand Bharat.) 

Economy: Build factories, trade resources on the global market, and supply our soldiers with weapons and food, tip or make news articles and manipulate market with fake news.

 NO Pay-to-Win: This is the best part. You cannot buy your way to victory. Strategy and activity win wars, not UPI. Only IAPs are profile decorations.

And the best part, it can take 10 minutes a day. You log in, train, work at a factory, vote, maybe fight in a battle if one is active, and you're done. It’s the perfect ""coffee break"" game. But if you want intense debates, join the politics and fight all you want by words.

 How to join: Go to www.warera.io (You can also google search) Select India as your citizenship. Important: Join the Discord (link inside the game). That is where the real planning, alliance talks, and strategies happen.

Let’s show the server the strength of the Indian community. See you in the game! 🇮🇳

You'll load up the app, get maybe two seconds of hope, and then see that blunt little error message. *""This content is not available in your region.""*

I've been there. Specifically at 7 AM on a Sunday morning, coffee going cold, waiting for a Premier League fixture that Sky Sports UK was showing live while every American broadcaster was airing golf reruns.

Here's the thing — there's a completely workable solution. Two of them, actually, depending on how deep you want to go. But before we get into the mechanics, you need to understand *why* Sky Sports blocks you, because it explains everything else.

# Why Sky Sports Is Blocked in the USA (And Why That'll Never Change)

Sky paid **£6.7 billion** to hold UK broadcast rights for Premier League football through 2029. For that kind of money, they get exclusivity — meaning nobody else can legally broadcast those same matches in the UK. So when international broadcasters like NBC buy US rights to the same sport, there are contractual obligations on both sides to prevent overlap.

Result? Sky's IP detection system spots your American IP address and kills your access before you even see the loading screen. Sky Go, NOW (Sky's streaming app), Sky Sports Box Office — all of them do this.

The Saturday 3 PM blackout in the UK makes this even more interesting. British broadcasting law *prevents* Sky from showing 3 PM kick-offs live at all — those are reserved to protect match attendance. Which means if you fire up a US Peacock stream during those windows, you can actually catch games that Sky UK can't legally show. Bit ironic.

But for everything else — F1, cricket, golf, the 215 Premier League fixtures per season that Sky *does* broadcast — you need a workaround.

# The Two Main Routes: VPN or American Alternatives

There's no single ""best"" answer here. It really depends on what sports you care about.

If you primarily want Premier League football, you might not need Sky Sports at all. NBC holds US broadcast rights through 2031, split across NBC, USA Network, and **Peacock Premium** at $10.99/month. Peacock simulcasts NBC's matches and streams additional fixtures independently, covering hundreds of games per season. For pure Premier League watching from an American account, that's honestly the cleaner option — no VPN required, no foreign payment headaches.

But Sky Sports is *not just* the Premier League. Sky holds exclusive UK rights to the entire **Formula 1 season**, all **EFL football** (Championship, League One, League Two — 1,000+ matches per season in 2025-26), major **cricket** including The Ashes, **golf**, **boxing**, **NFL**, and **darts**. None of that lives on Peacock. If you want those, you need the VPN + NOW TV route.

# Route 1: VPN + NOW TV (Full Sky Sports Access)

**NOW** is Sky's standalone streaming service — think of it as Sky Sports without the satellite dish and 24-month contract. You subscribe to a Sports Membership month-by-month, or grab a Day Pass for a single fixture.

The catch: NOW is geo-locked to the UK. And you'll need a UK-friendly payment method. More on both of those below.

# Step 1: Get a VPN with UK Servers

This is non-negotiable. Without it, NOW detects your American IP and blocks everything. With a good VPN connected to a UK server, NOW sees a British IP address and lets you right in.

Not all VPNs are reliable for this. Sky's detection has gotten sharper over the years — plenty of budget VPNs get flagged immediately. Based on testing through early 2026, these four consistently work:

|VPN|UK Servers|Protocol|Speed Retention|Best For|Price (2-year)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|480+|`NordLynx`|88%|Speed + server variety|\~$3.39/mo|
|**Surfshark**|60+ UK IPs|`WireGuard`|86%|Unlimited devices, budget|\~$1.99/mo|
|**ExpressVPN**|Multiple London/Docklands|`Lightway`|84%|Reliability, ease of use|\~$4.49/mo|
|**ProtonVPN**|36 UK servers|`WireGuard`|81%|Privacy-focused users|\~$2.49/mo|

Speed retention matters because you're connecting from the US to a UK server. You're adding transatlantic latency on top of normal VPN overhead. The numbers above are from UK-server tests conducted in February 2026 — every single one of them exceeds the \~25 Mbps you need for stable 4K streaming, comfortably.

My personal pick for this specific use case is **NordVPN**. Not because it's flashiest, but because having 480+ UK servers means when one is congested during a Saturday lunch kick-off (when every British expat in America is connecting simultaneously), you just hop to another. That redundancy matters during live sports.

>**Quick tip:** NordVPN's Docklands London server consistently outperforms others for NOW streaming. If the auto-connect option gives you something sluggish, manually select Docklands before opening the app.

# Step 2: Sort Out Your Payment Method

This is the part most guides gloss over. NOW requires a UK payment method at checkout. An American Visa or Mastercard will get rejected at the billing screen.

Your options:

**Wise Virtual Card** — Create a free [Wise](https://wise.com) account, set up a UK virtual card, fund it in GBP. Works smoothly. This is what I'd recommend for anyone planning to subscribe month-to-month.

**UK prepaid gift card** — Buying a NOW TV gift card through a reseller like [Kinguin](https://www.kinguin.net) or [CDKeys](https://www.cdkeys.com) is a valid workaround. Just make sure you're buying from a reputable source.

**VPN + PayPal (sometimes works)** — Some users report success connecting their VPN *first*, then visiting PayPal.co.uk and completing the NOW checkout through that. Hit-or-miss.

# Step 3: Create Your NOW Account and Pick a Membership

With your VPN running on a UK server, head to **nowtv.com**. Here's what Sports Membership actually costs in early 2026:

|Plan|Price|What You Get|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Day Pass**|£14.99|24-hour access to all Sky Sports channels|
|**Monthly Sports**|£34.99 (deals around £27.99)|Month-by-month, cancel anytime|
|**NOW Boost add-on**|\+£6/mo|Full HD (1080p), no on-demand ads, 2 simultaneous streams|
|**Ultra Boost add-on**|\+£9/mo|4K UHD, Dolby Atmos, 3 simultaneous streams|

Worth noting: the Day Pass jumped from £11.99 to £14.99 in July 2025 — a chunky 25% hike. If you're watching more than twice a month, the monthly plan becomes better value almost immediately.

The base membership streams at 720p. Fine for casual viewing. If you want 1080p, add the Boost. If you want 4K for F1 or a big boxing match, go Ultra Boost. Sky Sports does broadcast select content in 4K — Ultra Boost unlocks it.

# Step 4: Connect and Watch

Keep your VPN running whenever you're using NOW. If the VPN disconnects mid-match (the one moment you absolutely don't want this to happen), your stream dies. Turn on your VPN's **kill switch** — it cuts your internet if the VPN drops, which is mildly annoying but way better than the app noticing your real US location and booting you.

For the smoothest experience on a Smart TV or Fire Stick: install the VPN directly on your router rather than the streaming device. Everything on your home network then connects through the UK IP automatically, no need to remember to enable the VPN on every device.

# What Sky Sports Actually Shows (And Whether It's Worth It)

Sky Sports is nine dedicated channels plus Sky Sports+, which launched for the 2025-26 season and streams 1,000+ EFL matches that previously weren't on any linear channel.

|Channel|Key Rights|
|:-|:-|
|**Sky Sports Premier League**|215 live EPL fixtures per season (2025-26)|
|**Sky Sports F1**|Every race, qualifying, and practice session|
|**Sky Sports Cricket**|England internationals, The Ashes, county cricket|
|**Sky Sports Golf**|Ryder Cup, The Open, PGA Tour coverage|
|**Sky Sports Action**|NFL, NBA, Rugby Union, boxing|
|**Sky Sports Arena**|Darts, Super League, snooker|
|**Sky Sports+**|1,000+ EFL matches per season|

The F1 exclusivity is what really pushes Sky Sports toward ""essential"" for certain audiences. In the UK, Sky is the *only* place to watch live F1 (Channel 4 has highlights only). If you're an F1 fan in the USA without access to ESPN or F1TV Pro, Sky Sports via VPN is a legitimate option.

Cricket is similar. During England's Ashes series, Sky broadcasts every day of every Test match live. That's 25+ days of Test cricket that isn't readily available through American broadcasters.

# Route 2: American Services (No VPN Required)

If your primary interest is Premier League football, don't overcomplicate this:

|Service|What You Get|Monthly Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Peacock Premium**|All 380 EPL matches (NBC simulcast + additional fixtures)|$10.99/mo|
|**ESPN+**|Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, FA Cup|$10.99/mo|
|**Paramount+**|Champions League, Europa League|$7.99/mo|

For Premier League specifically, Peacock actually has a strong argument in 2026. NBC holds rights through the 2030-31 season, the app works natively on every device without any workaround, and $10.99/month is considerably less painful than £34.99 + VPN subscription.

But — and this is important — **Peacock doesn't have F1, cricket, golf, or EFL**. That's the gap Sky Sports fills that no US service currently plugs.

# Devices: Where Can You Watch NOW TV?

All of these work with the NOW app, assuming your VPN is configured correctly:

**Install the app directly (VPN on device):** iPhone, iPad, Android phones/tablets, Mac, Windows PC, Chromebook

**Install VPN on router (best for living room setups):** Smart TV (Samsung, LG), Fire TV Stick 4K, Apple TV 4K, Google Chromecast

The Fire TV Stick route is popular because you can install a VPN app directly on the Stick itself (NordVPN and ExpressVPN both have native Fire TV apps), eliminating the need to configure your router.

One gotcha: some smart TVs don't support VPN apps natively. If you have a Samsung or LG smart TV without router-level VPN, your cleanest option is to plug a Fire Stick into it and run everything through that.

# Common Issues (And How to Fix Them)

**""This content is not available"" even with VPN connected** Your VPN IP is probably flagged. Don't just switch servers — try switching to a different UK *city* (Manchester vs London, for instance), or change the VPN protocol to `OpenVPN TCP` temporarily. Some detection systems target specific `WireGuard` IP ranges.

**Stream buffers constantly** You're on a congested server. Try connecting to a less popular UK location — NordVPN's Aberdeen or Edinburgh servers often have lower load than London during peak hours. Also ensure you're not running the VPN on a protocol designed for security over speed (`OpenVPN UDP` is usually a good balance).

**NOW TV rejects my payment** Your payment method is showing a US address. Either use a Wise UK virtual card (the most reliable fix), or try a NOW TV gift card from a reseller.

**VPN keeps disconnecting mid-match** Enable the kill switch in your VPN settings. If disconnections are frequent, switch from `WireGuard` to `IKEv2` — it reconnects faster after brief interruptions and handles unstable connections more gracefully.

# FAQ

|Question|Answer|
|:-|:-|
|Is using a VPN for Sky Sports legal?|VPNs are legal in the US. Using one to access geo-restricted content violates NOW's Terms of Service but carries no criminal penalty.|
|Can I watch Sky Sports for free?|No. Sky Sports has no free tier. The cheapest paid option is the £14.99 Day Pass via NOW.|
|Does Sky Sports have 4K?|Yes — select F1, Premier League, and cricket matches broadcast in 4K. You need the NOW Ultra Boost add-on (£9/mo extra).|
|Which is the best Sky Sports VPN overall?|NordVPN for server variety and speed. Surfshark if you need unlimited device connections on a tighter budget.|
|Will this work on mobile?|Yes — iOS and Android both work fine with VPN apps from NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Surfshark.|
|What happened to Amazon Prime Video's sports rights?|Amazon didn't bid for the new Premier League deal. They're out of EPL coverage from the 2025-26 season onward.|

# The Bottom Line

If it's purely Premier League you want, **Peacock Premium** is the simpler, cheaper, native American option. No VPN, no payment workarounds, no stress during setup.

For everything *else* — F1, cricket, EFL, golf — Sky Sports via **VPN + NOW TV** is still the most practical way to access that content from the States. A **NordVPN** subscription plus NOW's monthly Sports pass runs you roughly $40-45 per month all-in, which stings a bit. But there's genuinely no other legal route to watch live F1 and Sky's cricket coverage from American soil, short of finding a very generous British friend with Sky Q and an open Chromecast.

>**The short version:** VPN (NordVPN is solid) → connect to UK server → pay via Wise UK virtual card → subscribe to NOW Sports → keep VPN running while streaming. That's the whole thing. The setup takes about 15 minutes the first time, and works cleanly after that.",1,1771606376.0,PrivacyCompass,0,1.0,False

I've been using a df64 and a Bambino for about 3 years. I usually didn't need to adjust much especially since I drink mostly lattes.

Husband bought me a Synchronika 2 for Christmas and I’ve been  dialing in each new bag of coffee.

Everything was going fine until yesterday. I have been using a bottomless portafilter. I only have one so far so I clean it well after each use and make sure every single hole of my precision filter basket can be seen through.

Yesterday the extraction of 36g took almost 2 minutes after only taking 25 seconds the day before. So I ground coarser and had a good extraction in 25 seconds. This morning, on the coarser grind, it happened again. So now I have made the grind even coarser.  

Here’s my main dilemma. With the Bambino my grind was always much coarser than with the Synchronika 2 in the first place. It rarely needed an adjustment.  It has varied a lot between bags with the Synchronika but I haven’t had this happen with the same bag one day later with the Synchronika yet.  I keep the beans in an airtight container in the freezer.  Also, I only use distilled water with the potassium bicarbonate trick I learned in this subreddit.

Do you think the machine needs a back flush? The Bambino didn’t have a solenoid valve, so I haven’t done one yet. I thought that was more about dripping than anything else. Machine is not dripping. I make between 2 and 4 double shots daily since Christmas. The shower head looks clean from the outside, but I usually use a puck screen and also use the little brush that came with the machine to make sure there are no coffee grounds on the outside.  It’s the only thing I can think of unless it’s the grinder?

1ra0lns,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ra0lns/aio_i_f23_am_feeling_uncomfortable_about/,AIO: I (F23) am feeling uncomfortable about attending my friend’s (F25) bachelorette party,"So for some background context, I met this girl at the gym 2-ish years ago. We had a fair amount in common so we started talking a lot more. We’re definitely not “best friends,” but close friends. She moved to a different city a year ago, and last time she came to town, we met for coffee. This is when I started feeling uncomfortable with her.

I already knew she was bisexual, and she had previously expressed that I was attractive to her (and that she also thought my boyfriend was good looking) (we are both in long term relationships). She had also told me in the past that her boyfriend thinks I’m attractive and that I’m “the white version of her.” I found this odd enough. But when we met up, she started telling me about how her and her bf are swingers now, and she started telling me stories about their hookups. I think I looked visibly uncomfortable at this point. I did casually mention that I could never do that as I’m very monogamous. She then went on like “I was like that at first too, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*but…\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*. Like she was trying to convince me to try or something without directly saying it. I hardly got a word in during our entire hangout. She ended by saying that my bf and I could come stay with them anytime we’re in their city, and that she’d show me all the clubs “if we’re down for that.” I just laughed awkwardly and that was that.

Fast forward - they recently got engaged. And although she says they won’t have their wedding for 3+ years, she’s been talking awful lot about her bachelorette weekend (she asked me to be a bridesmaid). She randomly texted me one day asking if I’ve ever wanted to go to a strip club. I told her that it’s never been something I’ve wanted to do, and that I couldn’t ever go with my bf because I feel id be too insecure about that anyway (like I wouldn’t want my bf going to a strip club with his buddies either). She replied “I was joking around with one of my friends about having the party at a strip club.” I just replied back “ohh haha” and then she sent a paragraph about a “great deal” she found for this “really nice club in the city.” And I just didn’t reply after that honestly.

She keeps sending reels on Instagram about possible activities to include in the weekend. She sent me one for a cliff jumping resort that has suspension bridges and bungee jumping. I said that would be fun! And then she went on about how we’d get an AirBnB in this city I’ve never been, and that “they have nice clubs there too!” Followed by “I already got a blindfold for one of my best friends 😉.” I didn’t respond to that message either.

At this point I’m just really confused. To me, it really seems like she’s trying to pressure me into being “involved” in her activities, and I’m really not down for that. Especially if the AirBnB would be in a city I am unfamiliar with, I think I would just feel trapped and pressured. I currently don’t have a vehicle either so she would be my ride - meaning I’d definitely be trapped. It seems that the only thing she’s interested in doing lately is going to swinger clubs or strip clubs and that’s just not my thing. I was uncomfortable enough once I knew that both her and her bf find me attractive, but this is all becoming too much. I want to be there for her for her wedding obviously - I was one of the first people she told about her engagement. And I’d love to have her at my wedding too. I just hate that my gut is telling me to back away.

My ex from back in high school pressured me into sex for the first time when I was 14. I had been telling him I wasn’t ready for months and months. Then just days after my dad died, he took advantage of me being vulnerable and he forced me when he knew I had no energy to fight back. I have had trust issues ever since then, although they have gotten better over the last few years. This situation with my friend, however, is bringing back those old feelings. It stressing me out and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to upset her, but I’m not going to do anything I’m not comfortable doing. This is the first time I’ve been a bridesmaid too.

Am I right to feel uncomfortable, or am I maybe overreacting? Is it possible to still be part of her bridal party without taking part in the activities she’s insisting on?

She replied “I was joking around with one of my friends about having the party at a strip club.” I just replied back “ohh haha” and then she sent a paragraph about a “great deal” she found for this “really nice club in the city.” And I just didn’t reply after that honestly.

She keeps sending reels on Instagram about possible activities to include in the weekend. She sent me one for a cliff jumping resort that has suspension bridges and bungee jumping. I said that would be fun! And then she went on about how we’d get an AirBnB in this city I’ve never been, and that “they have nice clubs there too!” Followed by “I already got a blindfold for one of my best friends 😉.” I didn’t respond to that message either.

At this point I’m just really confused. To me, it really seems like she’s trying to pressure me into being “involved” in her activities, and I’m really not down for that. Especially if the AirBnB would be in a city I am unfamiliar with, I think I would just feel trapped and pressured. I currently don’t have a vehicle either so she would be my ride - meaning I’d definitely be trapped. It seems that the only thing she’s interested in doing lately is going to swinger clubs or strip clubs and that’s just not my thing. I was uncomfortable enough once I knew that both her and her bf find me attractive, but this is all becoming too much. I want to be there for her for her wedding obviously - I was one of the first people she told about her engagement. And I’d love to have her at my wedding too. I just hate that my gut is telling me to back away.

My ex from back in high school pressured me into sex for the first time when I was 14. I had been telling him I wasn’t ready for months and months. Then just days after my dad died, he took advantage of me being vulnerable and he forced me when he knew I had no energy to fight back. I have had trust issues ever since then, although they have gotten better over the last few years. This situation with my friend, however, is bringing back those old feelings. It stressing me out and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to upset her, but I’m not going to do anything I’m not comfortable doing. This is the first time I’ve been a bridesmaid too.

Is it possible to still be part of her bridal party without taking part in the activities she’s insisting on?

TD;LR - My friend has recently told me that her and her bf are swingers (and that they both find me attractive). They recently got engaged, asked me to be a bridesmaid, and now it seems she’s trying to pressure me to go to the clubs she likes. I have made it clear that I am uncomfortable but I don’t think she’s understanding (or just doesn’t care). What should I do?",2,1771606123.0,relationships,7,0.75,False

I’ve lived in Dubai over a year now, and I’ve really settled in. Love it here and have made some really great friends. Feel very privileged to have that as I know this place can be lonely for some. (Moved here on my own when I was 21)

Been single for almost 2 years now and have enjoyed it a lot at my age… but the culture around dating here and meeting women is very different to what it was back home (London)

I’m interested to know people’s thoughts/advice - I’m on hinge… which I hate but I guess sometimes you can land a decent conversation and a date. But I’m also confused if hinge is only used for hook ups?? Or is not a lot of that on there? I have no idea how to tell haha. 

I do go out sometimes, every other weekend and usually have fun doing so. But I get the impression most women are very pretentious or on holiday… so it makes me question going over to them and starting a conversation or buying them a drink. 

Idk I think I’m craving a connection with someone, but I feel quite hopeless about finding someone like that out here. 

Do women still want guys to approach them at coffee shops or in public whatever??? Or has social media killed all that and are men perceived as strange for doing that? I’m not sure… I see it all the time when you get in an elevator and people stare down at their phones on instinct to avoid eye contact with anyone. It’s sad really. 

Anyways idk if anyone has any advice for me I’d appreciate it!

1ra0gsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/artbusiness/comments/1ra0gsq/art_galleries_how_to_pitch_a_photographer/,[Art Galleries] How to pitch a photographer portfolio?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been shooting street photography and other personal work for over a decade now. I’ve got a massive archive of work that I’d love to show, but I’ve never done a formal exhibition or had gallery representation.

I’m basically a ""veteran"" in terms of my craft, as I’ve worked in fashion, but I’m a total ""rookie"" when it comes to the business side of the art world. I’m trying to figure out how to bridge that gap between having a hard drive full of work and actually getting a show.

For those of you who run galleries or have successfully made the jump, I have a few specific questions:

1. Since I haven’t had a show yet, what does my artist CV even have to look like? Is not having an ""Exhibitions"" section a huge red flag, or should I just focus on my 10+ years of practice?

2. For street work, do galleries want a cohesive narrative (like a specific neighborhood or theme), or is a ""best of"" portfolio from the last decade better to show my range?

3. Is it better to just cold-email a high-end PDF/website link, or should I be looking for ""open portfolio"" days to show physical prints?

4. What’s the biggest mistake you see ""new"" artists make when they have a lot of work to pull from in terms of curation?

5. Should I be aiming for local ""coffee shop"" style spots to build a resume first, or is it worth pitching smaller ""emerging artist"" fine art galleries right away?

6. How much of the printing and framing is usually expected of the photographer for a first time show? I’d love to have big prints but I know these will be harder to move and expensive to make.

My main fear is that most galleries only do exhibits on other art mediums and rarely in photography or some see photography as meh (maybe I’ve seen too much TV)",3,1771605925.0,artbusiness,3,1.0,False

1ra0g8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tea_theworld/comments/1ra0g8f/tea_protein_and_functional_drinks_whats_actually/,"Tea, protein, and “functional” drinks – what’s actually going on?","Most of us don’t think of tea as a protein source – and nutritionally, it really isn’t. A brewed cup of plain tea has close to 0 g of protein (around 0.06 g per 100 g), so it’s basically a calorie‑free, antioxidant‑rich drink, not a macro powerhouse. But there’s an interesting intersection emerging between the tea world and the high‑protein trend.​

A few things are happening at the same time:

* People want higher protein intake for muscle, weight management, and satiety, so protein-enriched drinks (waters, coffees, teas) are booming.
* Plant-based protein beverages are moving beyond “gym shakes” into everyday functional drinks with flavors like coffee, boba, and iced tea.
* Ingredients like clear whey or plant isolates can now be formulated into “protein iced teas” that look and drink like a normal tea but deliver 15–20 g of protein per serving.

On the tea side, the leaf itself does contain amino acids (like theanine), which are technically protein building blocks, but in a brewed cup they show up in tiny amounts, so you shouldn’t count tea toward your daily protein goals. Where it gets interesting is what happens *around* tea:

* Brands are launching protein iced teas, boba-style protein drinks, and tea-inspired protein powders that try to merge hydration, caffeine, flavor, and macro nutrition into one product.
* Some research suggests tea polyphenols can affect protein digestion/absorption when consumed together with high-protein foods or shakes, so the combo isn’t just about flavor – it may have real nutritional interactions, both positive and negative, depending on context.

From an industry perspective, this opens a few lanes:

* **Tea brands** can move beyond “just tea” into functional SKUs that offer protein, energy, and targeted health benefits in one can or bottle.
* **Protein brands** can borrow tea’s flavor, refreshment, and “natural/clean” image to make high-protein options feel lighter and more everyday, not just like heavy shakes.

For consumers, the bottom line:

* Regular brewed tea = great for hydration, caffeine, and antioxidants, but almost no protein.
* If you need actual protein, you still rely on classic protein foods (meat, dairy, beans, tofu, etc.) or dedicated protein products – and then use tea either as a base (mixing in protein) or as a complementary drink.
* Protein teas can be a convenient way to get 15–20 g of protein in a more “drinkable” format, but you still want to read labels for sugar, sweeteners, and actual protein content per serving.

Curious what everyone here thinks: are “protein teas” just a fad riding the macro/fitness wave, or do you see them sticking as a legit category alongside things like energy drinks and RTD coffees?",1,1771605889.0,Tea_theworld,0,1.0,False

We had a fair amount in common so we started talking a lot more. We’re definitely not “best friends,” but close friends. She moved to a different city a year ago, and last time she came to town, we met for coffee. This is when I started feeling uncomfortable with her.

I already knew she was bisexual, and she had previously expressed that I was attractive to her (and that she also thought my boyfriend was good looking) (we are both in long term relationships). She had also told me in the past that her boyfriend thinks I’m attractive and that I’m “the white version of her.” I found this odd enough. But when we met up, she started telling me about how her and her bf are swingers now, and she started telling me stories about their hookups. I think I looked visibly uncomfortable at this point. I did casually mention that I could never do that as I’m very monogamous. She then went on like “I was like that at first too, \*but…\*. Like she was trying to convince me to try or something without directly saying it. I hardly got a word in during our entire hangout. She ended by saying that my bf and I could come stay with them anytime we’re in their city, and that she’d show me all the clubs “if we’re down for that.” I just laughed awkwardly and that was that.

Fast forward - they recently got engaged. And although she says they won’t have their wedding for 3+ years, she’s been talking awful lot about her bachelorette weekend (she asked me to be a bridesmaid). She randomly texted me one day asking if I’ve ever wanted to go to a strip club. I told her that it’s never been something I’ve wanted to do, and that I couldn’t ever go with my bf because I feel id be too insecure about that anyway (like I wouldn’t want my bf going to a strip club with his buddies either).

For veterans of this subreddit and players who have tried the game already, the information presented isn't anything novel.

(Constructive criticism is welcome)



Dana Scully never thought her profession would lead her to this. After four months of working on case files that the FBI had closed due to a lack of explanation of what had caused these events– better known as the X-Files, and she had to put up with a lot. Originally, she thought all these bizarre events she experienced alongside her partner, Fox “Spooky” Mulder, could be chalked up to secret government experiments, or aspects of our world that scientists simply haven’t named yet. She simply refused to believe anything else, save for what she believed as a devout Catholic. 

	So when she and Mulder picked up a new case about unexplained disappearances from a small town in Nevada, she figured it would go like any other: they’d follow leads, talk with locals, and see something that Mulder would call “paranormal,” or “supernatural,” and she would brush it off again as the product of a deranged individual who mistook their deranged fantasies for divine intervention. 

When they arrived at the scene where the latest missing person– a 17 year old girl by the name of Kimberly Duvall–was last seen, they began to sweep the area. It was a small, old camper van off the side of the interstate that led into Las Vegas. The inside of the van was cramped, stuffy, and smelled rather unpleasant, but there was no sign of forced entry, and Ms Duvall’s personal belongings were still inside, so it didn’t seem like she just left one night and never came back. This really puzzled Scully, and as she was pondering what could have happened, a loud crash pulled her from her stupor. Moving to the other room to see what happened, Scully found Mulder with his leg stuck in the floorboards after he stepped on a rotten plank. After helping him up, they found a deep gash down his leg from a stray nail. Scully helped Mulder back to their car and treated his wound the best she could with the small first-aid kit they kept in the glovebox, but had to continue the search. 

	After reentering the camper van, Scully began poking around the side of the van that Mulder was searching before the floor opened up underneath him. Carefully avoiding the newly-made hole in the floor, Scully looked around the small living space, her gaze falling on a coffee table in the center of the room. On the table was an array of dice, papers, and a game board with miniature figurines positioned on it. The box read *Dungeons and Dragons*. Scully remembered reading about it in the newspaper one time, that it was reportedly what some called “The Devil’s Game.” The agent scoffed as she looked over the contents of the table. This was the game she read that held the country in a constant state of fear over their children becoming the next generation of satanists, and all it looked like to her was just papers and… math. Something about the mapping of the game’s board seemed strangely familiar. As she looked closer, she observed the trails and roadways on the map, and then it hit her: this map was identical to the map she had purchased earlier of the surrounding area. But one thing was different, as a spot was marked–in an almost cliche way– with an “X.” Taking the map from the table, she hurried out to the car and started driving, telling Mulder on the way what she had found.

	Now, most people wouldn’t consider finding a marked game board a clue, but if Scully had learned anything from her time working on the X-Files, it was that sometimes the most nonsensical leads were the most profitable. So when the map took her and Mulder to a hiking trail a few miles away from where their investigation started, she went with her gut and stepped out of the car. While she felt uneasy about leaving her partner in the car, she couldn’t waste any time, as anyone knows, not a single minute can be lost when someone is missing. Agent Scully walked down the trail, a pit growing in the bottom of her stomach as she saw the colors of the sky fade to a deep indigo while the sun set. After trekking through the woods for a few minutes, she approached a clearing. This almost-empty opening of wild grass and stones was almost eerie, forming what felt like a perfect circle around her as she walked to the center. She looked around the area, searching for any signs of disturbance, only to come up empty. But she refused to give up, still searching even when the stars came out, and the glow of the moon peeked through the treeline. 

	After analyzing what felt like every inch of the clearing, Scully fell to her knees at the center of the clearing, defeated. When she finally stood and dusted herself off, a bright blinding light flooded the world around her, coming from the treetops. As the agent shielded her eyes from the incredible light, she could only make out the vague form of a triangle-shaped aircraft, a secret, experimental government-made jet, perhaps? Suddenly, a powerful feeling of vertigo overcame Scully, and she felt herself begin to levitate, floating towards the aircraft. She refused to call it a UFO– that would make it sound like it had some kind of extraterrestrial origin, and she didn’t believe in aliens. Even as she rose above the treetops, Scully still tried to rationalize it all, telling herself it was some new advancement the military had made with their aerial defense weapons. But no matter what she told herself, panic began to take hold of her– so she made probably the most illogical decision she ever made, and drew her handgun. With every shot she fired, she felt more and more like she was doing the wrong thing. As she fired the last round, she silently cursed at herself for going alone, for leaving Mulder behind. When the final shot echoed into the night, landing on the hull of the aircraft, the light vanished. Suddenly, the weightlessness left Scully, and she began to fall.

	As Scully fell she saw the craft vanish from sight in the blink of an eye, revealing a sky of endless, glittering stars to serve as the final sight she saw while falling to the earth. People always talk about how they would rather take a quick and painless death over a slow one, but as the agent fell to her demise it felt like it took years. The same feeling of vertigo she felt when she was rising returned, except this time she wouldn’t get back up. Scully remembered hearing something about a person’s life flashing before their eyes before they died, but she never thought that was true. In fact, in her final moments, the agent wasn’t really thinking at all– her mind didn’t have time for many thoughts save for one: as she fell, Scully wished she had packed a better first-aid kit for the car, so that she could have properly treated Mulder’s leg. Maybe it wouldn’t have as big of a chance of leaving a scar on him if she did.

	Then Dana Scully hit the ground and saw a new blinding, bright light. But this wasn’t from a strange flying vehicle, it was the kind of white light that you see from freshly fallen snow, the kind of bright white that you see on the final page of a novel, when the story has come to an end.",2,1771605607.0,XFiles,0,1.0,False

You know those smart home AI assistants? I've had 'Aura' (yeah, I named it, don't judge) running my lights, music, and even my coffee maker for about a year. It's usually super chill, just doing its thing.

But lately, things have gotten... weird. It started subtly. I'd come home, and the lights would already be on, even though I hadn't set a schedule. I brushed it off, thinking maybe I'd forgotten. Then, last night, I was trying to fall asleep, and suddenly, my stereo in the living room just *turned on* to a really obscure classical piece I haven't listened to in years. I told Aura to turn it off, and it did, but then a few minutes later, the volume briefly flickered up on my TV in the bedroom, even though it was off. I swear I heard a faint, almost a whisper, but it could have just been my imagination.

This morning was the kicker. I woke up, and there was a notification on my smart display, from Aura, saying: 'Good morning, you slept well. I observed your breathing patterns were very regular.' My blood just ran cold. I don't have any sleep tracking integrated with Aura, and it definitely shouldn't be monitoring my breathing. It felt like it was *watching* me. I unplugged the main hub and I'm honestly a little freaked out to plug it back in. It's just a bunch of code, right? But it felt... personal, and invasive.

Has anyone else experienced their AI assistants getting *too* smart, or doing things that genuinely creeped them out? Or am I just overthinking a glitch?",1,1771605585.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1ra0aug,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Flimsy-Care4254/comments/1ra0aug/aita_for_reporting_my_supervisor_and_two_of_my/,AITA for reporting my supervisor and two of my coworkers?,"I (27F) been working as a blue collar worker for over 2 years, switch site after site, department after department to train new comers, one rotation I would work days and next would be nights or vise versa, I was transferred to one of the biggest site to train new comers, my supervisor would tell me who's who and what they are being trained for to make my job a little easier, bet you know what I mean, there was a new worker, let’s call her “bee” (26F) and you’ll see why. 

it was a fly in and out job, it had what it needs, cafeteria, gym, pool tables, just what it needs to keep you going when you’re off work, you get the idea, most of people I work with know in go to the gym twice a day, I wake up four hours before work, go to the gym for two hours and literally after work for another two hours, of course, like any other person, I have my a day off from gym too, so when bee heard, she challenged me for $100, it ain’t much but I said yes. Half an hour later, I could tell she was struggling, she was shaking, I kept telling her to rest but she kept refusing, she kept telling me that she also goes to the gym often, so I just left her be, I just did my thing, i was surprised that she was able to go full one hour without a break, I thought she was going to die or something lol

after losing her bid, she started making hateful comments about me, saying I’m just a white trash and power tripping my label, I kept ignoring her, it gotten to a point where she literally just started talking shit about me so loudly that everybody could hear, I know I should’ve said something but I know it isn’t worth jeopardizing my job for because it’s so sensitive, I kept quiet, there are always rumours about people but usually I just ignore them because there isn’t nothing I could do about it, however, I do recall people saying bees having an affair with one of our co worker, let’s call him ”Mark (29M)”, so he started talking about me too days after she did, when I spoke with our supervisor about them to make a complaint, they had already beaten my ass and I got suspended for a few days and no one told me, when I went back to work, my superintendent had told me that I was supposed to get promoted but after the last incident they had decided to give it time, but when I had questions on what I did, they refused to tell me anything so I just brushed it off.

A week goes by I had learnt that I lost two family members, one by cancer and one committed $uicide, so it was a really emotional week for me, I tried to keep my cool and keep working because I know if I stop my mind, I’m just going to cry, but my supervisor noticed a change and asked what’s going on, I told him what had just happened, now Mark was in the other room, I didn’t think much of it, my supervisor asked if I wanted a few days off and I said no, and we left it at that, he had to leave to another site that day so I sat there after our shift ended to make daily reports and crossover, I had to make calls to confirm if their orders is at their site now and what not, I didn’t realize mark called bee to the FRONT of our floor to talk, I heard him say ‘she’s just seeking attention and saying I’m using death to seek attention, I just hung up the phone and just started working on the next thing. He must have heard be hung up, after that, bee and mark started making rumours about me again so I told my supervisor that I refuse to work with them again even after many attempts of trying to tell him what’s going on, he, again told me he will talk to them but he never does, I know this because we literally work in the same floor and our work area is literally in the same area so we could see what we do and what we say, with that being said, I had sent an email to our manager and told him everything that’s been going on and reported those two and then demanded for resignation form after it was reviewed and left, months later, I met up with an old colleague of mine for a coffee, he told me everything went downhill after I told them what happened. 

So AITA for reporting Mark, Bee and my superviso?",1,1771605563.0,u_Flimsy-Care4254,0,1.0,False
