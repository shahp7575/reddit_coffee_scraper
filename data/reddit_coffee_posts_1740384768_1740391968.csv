1iwyrmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterenergy/comments/1iwyrmc/what_side_effects_have_you_experienced_after/,What „side effects“ have you experienced after stopped drinking energy drinks,"I drink 500ml of Monster Zero every day (and a coffee in the morning and often Pepsi Zero in the evening), so I drink a lot of caffeine every day. Then I was on holiday for 4 days and didn't drink any energy drinks and on the 2nd day I had a bad headache and was extremely tired throughout the day. Was it because I didn't drink any energy drinks? I never normally have headaches.
Did you also experience some bad headaches and were tired after stopped drinking energy drinks?",1,1740391856.0,monsterenergy,1,1.0,False

1iwyodh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iwyodh/71f_doctors_please_advise_this_is_a_lengthy_post/,"71F, Doctors please advise. This is a lengthy post and I would greatly appreciate your input! My grandmother is 71 years old, 5'1"" tall, currently weighing 83 pounds! She was 98 pounds at her last appointment in October. Meds listed at the end."," She is diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, alzheimers (almost 3 years ago), history of depression and major depressive episode (spent 5 days in hospital on psych hold after emergency room visit in December 2018, followed by 4 weeks of partial hospitalization program), COPD, colon cancer survivor (2008), history of diverticulitis and bowel resection surgery.

She still lives at home with her spouse. She is adamant that she does not want to go to a nursing home/assisted living facility. She is basically starving herself and she already struggles with her weight because of EPI. She has food in the home, she has a large variety of Ensure and similar brand shakes. She won't drink the shakes she says she doesn't like the taste or the texture. She literally snacks on chocolate and decaf coffee. Although yesterday she told us she hasn't been drinking coffee because she doesn't have a desire for it anymore. She's been complaining about being constipated and uncomfortable. 

To be clear, she still has decision making capacity. She pays their household bills online, plays games like solitaire and words with friends on her phone, does basic housekeeping things. She is capable in the sense that she has the mobility to do things like eating, bathing, getting up and going to the bathroom, but she chooses not to. She will sit around in the same clothes for 5-7 days sometimes. She will go anywhere from 5-10 days between showers at times. She says she doesn't change her clothes or shower because she's just sitting in the house. She wears adult diapers. About a year ago she kept complaining that she was urinating frequently and I was concerned. I suggested she go to the doctor. She kept putting it off. It went on for a few months before she finally agreed to go to the doctor. She told the doctor she was urinating so often that she would just keep the same diaper on instead of getting up to change it right away because she knew she would have to go again soon. The doctor told her she had a UTI from her sitting in her own waste for such lengths of time. The UTI eventually went away after being treated but her hygiene hasn't changed much. 

She has prescribed medications she is supposed to take in the morning and at night. She has a medication dispenser that is locked and has alarms for the times she is supposed to take her meds and will dispense them when she turns off the alarm. For the past 7.5 weeks she has been skipping meds anywhere from 3 to 8 times per week. When the pills are dispensed she just sits them in a pile on a shelf next to her recliner instead of taking them. The reason for the dispenser is because when she was filling her own pill organizer she kept getting pills mixed up that looked similar and wasn't taking them properly then.

I live next door so I am very much aware of her day to day activities or lack thereof. She doesn't leave the house, she sits in the living room watching TV, doom scrolling Facebook and news sites, or sleeping. She constantly watches and reads about things that are extremely triggering to her and she knows they're triggers. She getting upset and angry if anyone suggests she take a break from that content. She gets mad when anyone tries to get her to leave the house, whether it be to go out to eat, shop, or go to appointments. 

She uses an oxygen machine at night and has an ambulatory oxygen tank for times when she leaves the house and will be walking around; however, she refuses to take the ambulatory tank with her anywhere. 

She has been prescribed Creon for more than a year, which was covered by her insurance when she had United Healthcare. As of a little over a month ago she no longer has UHC and now has Medicare Part D.  She ran out of Creon at least 3 weeks ago. Even with her current insurance she was told her out of pocket cost would be $700 now so she will not be getting it refilled. She and my aunt (my grandmother's daughter) asked me to see if there were any kind of discounts or assistance available to help pay for it. There is an assistance program for Creon which I have requested info on and provided to my grandmother and aunt, including the application for the program. They have yet to take the application to her doctor to have it filled out and faxed. I have also shared info with them about the Medicare ExtraHelp Program. 

I am adamant that she needs to get medical care sooner rather than later. Her continued weight loss, lack of eating, general lack of interest in any form of self care, and continuing to skip medications is alarming to me. My grandmother, her spouse, and my aunt all disagree with me. My grandmother doesn't want to go to the doctor or hospital. Her spouse and my aunt don't want to argue with her so they just agree with her. My aunt said she and my grandmother agreed yesterday that if she hasn't improved in any way in 2 weeks then they would consider going to the hospital. I think this is ridiculous and borderline neglectful. She's not just magically going to improve in 2 weeks. At this rate I feel like she's one foot in the grave from malnutrition and dehydration. I have genuine concerns she might not make it 2 weeks and no one in my family seems to have any sense of urgency about getting her care. 

Her medications consist of the following: 
Creon, Sertraline, Lozartan, Aricept, Astorvastatin, Cilostazol, Colestipol, Trazadone, Risedronate, Omeprazole, Folic Acid, Fiber, Probiotic, Vitamin B12, Omega 3 Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Baby Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Melatonin

I live abroad and currently in India and would love some recommendations for great coffee to bring back with me. Whether it’s single-origin beans, unique blends, or local roasters doing something special, I’d love to hear your favorites.

I typically enjoy medium/dark roast beans, with chocolate, cocoa nibs, toffee, caramel notes if its dark roast and fruity, black currant, berries, etc if its medium roast. I mostly prefer Columbian, El Salvador, Ethiopian, Kenyan and Brazilian region Coffee beans. Light roasts are not for my taste :)

But don't want to stop lifting weights in the meantime,"Have had LPR fairly bad past few months, under control with strict diet, no smoking, no alcohol, 1 coffee a day, alkaline water all that jazz. 

I am not sure if it's HH yet or just long term poor diet etc. 

I am starting to lose muscle as it's been a few months out the gym during the LPR. 

I am cautious to go, I have a lot of anxiety in general and I don't want to lose muscle which might make it worse. And not exercising. But I'm cautious if I do have HH maybe I'll make it worse. 

Is there a way to know I am lifting safely? I was going to do higher reps lighter weight and not do any chest/back day. Basically just arms and shoulders. 

Can anyone speak from experience that lifting can be done safely and not make things worse? How would I know if I was making it worse?

Normally I am able to fall asleep on shift between calls without issue. Over the last several months, I noticed that even if the county is slow overnight, no calls are coming in and I am extremely tired, for the life of me I can’t fall asleep. It is just all night of tossing and turning.
Then there are some nights where I am running back to back calls and don’t even get the chance to lie down.

My question for others who work 24s : Do you normally stay awake the entire shift or are you able to sleep?

I feel like the grogginess I am experiencing is starting to affect my mood on calls. Would it be better just to stay up the entire 24 and religiously drink coffee?",1,1740391180.0,ems,4,1.0,False

1iwyl42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iwyl42/my_ex_let_a_girl_take_my_clothes_before_i_moved/,My ex let a girl take my clothes before I moved out.,"I (20F) and my ex boyfriend (22M) split a few months ago, after being together for 3 years- we were living together. For context my family lives in a different country. We split in December (because he cheated several times), so I decided to go home early for Christmas, and then I was going to come back and move out the rest of my things in the new year once I had found a new place to live. However my childhood best friend very suddenly passed so I took some extra time at home. He had assured me multiple times my stuff would be safe and to just look after myself and come back when I was ready. Last week, I went over to get my things, and instantly I noticed there were several things missing. We broke into argument, he called me “psychotic” because I simply asked if he had anyone round who would’ve stolen it. It went back and forth for so long I genuinely started to believe I was going crazy. He assured me he hadn’t slept with anyone since our split (so me an idiot slept with him again when I saw him.) He said he’d look for my things and then bring them to me, we met up for a coffee yesterday. And shocker, he did not bring my stuff. I confronted him as a friend of a friend had informed me of him sleeping with this one girl. So I confronted him, as I only slept with him under the premise there had been no one else (as I obviously hadn’t touched anyone since.) and then I managed to get the full details out of him, he had dozens of girls over in the flat, and he let one of them go “shopping” in my wardrobe. I stormed off in extreme anger. We have been messaging back and forth about this, and he is again making me seem like I am overreacting about MY stuff, and says he doesn’t know when to sort it and if he can. He won’t even give me the girl’s name. Do I get the police involved it’s about £800 worth of clothes.",1,1740391168.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1iwyjxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1iwyjxl/quitting_our_most_beloved_plant_toxin_caffeine/,Quitting our most beloved plant toxin - Caffeine. Anybody saw significant improvements after stopping coffee?,"I know, coffee is one of the most controversially discussed topics among carnivores and in my opinion it tends to be portrait as benign. Because I get it, everybody loves coffee and for some of us, like me, it is the last thing I actually look forward to every day that is not meat. I mean I fricking love coffee, to the point where I am actually pissed when I cannot have it. I think at the end of the day most of us have to admit that we are addicted to coffee, because as of now we cannot live without it. It is a drug. And it's not a harmless one. The more I read on the effects of caffeine on the body, the more I started questioning the detrimental effects it actually has on our bodies. Probably the most beneficial and healing effects of carnivore is that we are removing all of the plant toxins and antinutrients, yet caffeine always gets excused as being ""okay"". From what I have read, it is not and it is definitely not harmless. 

So here are some more insights on caffeine and its effects:

* Caffeine is a natural insecticide and neurotoxin for bugs; not biologically intended for human consumption.
* Impacts your deep sleep and REM sleep, thereby harming your recovery, no matter what time of day you have it.
* Since caffeine blocks adenosine and down-regulates the receptors, over time you need more and more caffeine in order to get the same wakefulness response. With long-term consumption coffee no longer boosts your energy but you will end up needing caffeine to feel some kind of energy.
* Increases cortisol & adrenaline, putting the body into constant “fight-or-flight” mode
* Caffeine drains B1, B2, B6, B12, leading to fatigue, brain fog, poor nerve function, and mood swings (if you never have, definitely look into B1 deficiency and how insane the impacts on your body can be). 
* Reduces iron absorption by up to 60%, increasing risk of anemia and fatigue.
* Increases urinary excretion of Mg & Ca, causing muscle cramps, poor sleep, and weaker bones.
* Blocks zinc absorption (lowers testosterone, weakens immunity); depletes taurine, inositol and potassium, causing dehydration.
* Can lead to adrenal fatigue over long-term consumption through overstimulation of cortisol & adrenaline, leading to energy crashes and hormone imbalances.
* Spikes insulin resistance, leading to blood sugar crashes and cravings.
* May lead to gastrointestinal inflammation, bloating and reflux.
* Adds an extra detox burden on the liver, slowing metabolism and recovery.

I know it is going to be a long and hard process, but I have decided to quit caffeine and maybe after reading this, at least some of you are going to join me. After removing all of this toxins from my diet, I  figured why should I leave in the toxin that I am most addicted to and depended on.

1iwyimf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwyimf/theres_something_wrong_with_the_soft_play_centre/,There’s something wrong with the soft play centre.,"When my Manager offered me extra shifts last week, I said yes without hesitation. I don’t do much in the evenings, and I could use the extra cash. 

“Get Nadia to show you round the play centre before you leave today,” said Craig.

Nadia’s my coworker. The soft play centre is her patch. Most jobs at the Leisure centre take two, maybe three hours at most, but Nadia rarely got away before ten each night. 

My tongue was already in knots. “Sorry–would it be ok if I got here for, like, 5pm?”

He gave a smiling nod. “Nadia doesn’t usually start the clean ‘til six.”

I thanked him again. Good manners make up for all the times I’d taken his instructions way too literally. Craig’s been much more tolerant with me than other bosses. His slow, plodding steps and thick Blackpool accent made it hard to feel afraid of him.

“See how you like it,”  he fell in step beside me as I continued down the corridor to find my colleague. I thought he was making a joke, and tried a laugh. “I’m probably a bit old for soft play.”

He laughed. “No, I meant the cleaning shift.”

“Oh–of course.”

“It’s a very different job from cleaning the gym. But if you like it, you could maybe take these hours on for good.”

“Is Nadia leaving?” 

Craig gave a slow shrug. “She’s off on holiday this week… we’ll see what happens after that. Thanks, sweetheart.”

 I liked Nadia. We didn’t know each other that well, but I’d only ever had kindly smiles from her and she never seemed annoyed when I asked for help. What’s more, I always thought that she kind of looked like Mary from Silent Hill (!) Eventually I found her in the cleaning cupboard, twirling her earphones round her finger. 

“Sorry.” 

At the sound of my voice, she let out a stifled gasp. 

I smiled an apology. “I should have knocked.”


She stared at me, wide-eyed, for a second or so, waiting for her brain to process whose face she was looking at. “Oh,” she laid her hand on my arm. “Sorry, honey, sorry.”

“N-no worries. Um–Craig says you’re off, tomorrow?”

She nodded. “I’m c-covering your shifts this week,” I continued, “...just wondered if you had a second to show me how you clean the soft play sometime this morning?”

Nadia looked at me in silence for a minute. It made me feel a little awkward. Had I offended her? “Craig asked you to cover me?” 

“Yeah,” I smiled. Her eyes grew wider. I felt myself wilt. I guessed she thought I wasn’t competent (but was too nice to admit it.)

“Uh-huh.” She shook her head, and stuck her phone back in her pocket, leaving the earphones trailing. Ushering me out, she smiled hard. “I start upstairs.”

The experience of that first walk-around was one of nostalgia. The faded walls, the gaudy illustrations of cartoon animals, and the playful shadows cast by snaking slides and sprawling ball pits were precisely as I remembered them. The sickly smell of birthday cake and vomit inspired in me a wave of memories. As we plodded round the parent’s cafe, I could almost see Mum sipping tea at the corner table, like some disconsolate prisoner. I felt my brother’s spirit running to the rope swing that dangled barely half a foot from the cushioned floor. Even the squeak of Nadia’s trainers against the spongy green floor was tinged with childhood. I remembered every lonely moment, playing by myself at the back while the other kids giggled behind me. 

“I don’t mop everyday,” Nadia’s voice brought me back from reverie. 

“Oh. That’s good.”

“Only once or twice a week. Or when someone’s spilled juice.”

I was glad to hear it. At the back of the soft play, the dimly lit corridors wound left and right without any discernible pattern. We passed a solitary waste bin. Shaped like an anthropomorphic beetle, its sordid smile betrayed ten years’ grime. “We…change the bins too, right?” I asked, when the silence had lasted a little too long between us.

“If you want,” Nadia turned to me. “We’re not technically meant to start clean-down until 6pm. But I try and sneak in here at 5. That way I’m not here after dark.”

“I imagine it’s a bit spooky after dark, back here–”

I meant it as a joke, but Nadia took me seriously. “You don’t have to stay the whole three hours, you know.”

Her heavy tone caught me off guard. But as I studied her face, I saw her features bore a strange, almost protective quality. “Just make sure you don’t hang around if you don’t need to. You…it doesn’t take a whole three hours. And if you feel weird about being here alone, just lock up and get out. Ok?”

I was touched. “Thanks.”

She held my gaze. It was as though she wanted me to say something more, but I couldn’t think of anything to say that wouldn’t sound contrived. “Still,” she added, at last. “Don’t put yourself at risk. It’s not worth it.”

My first shift was that night. I got to the sports centre just before 5 and got a redbull from the vending machine. Before I went any further, I pulled my earphones carefully over my head. The long, strip-lit corridor has that hard, vinyl flooring that makes footsteps offensively loud. I pattered past the disused lockers and the old squash courts, until I reached the door emblazoned:

TunnelWig Play Centre

I swiped my card and opened the door. As it was nearly closing, a handful of kids were visible through the rope mesh that separated the play centre from the parents’ cafe. A tired looking young woman called her child from one of the tables as the supervisor appeared behind the counter. She was tall and blonde; maybe 28, or 29 years old, and very pretty. “Hey,” she flashed me a sunny smile. 

“Hello,” I mumbled. “Am…I too early to get started?”

“Where’s Nadia?” 

“She’s on holiday.”

“Oh–you’re covering?”

“Uh-huh,” the sound of my voice was egregious to me. 

She nodded over to the cafe. “Would you mind getting started over there, please? Someone’s just wee-weed on the floor.”

My attraction to her died that instant. I filled my bucket full of lemon soap and hot water, before dragging it over to the pool of “wee-wee” (!) I finished up the floor and got started in the cafe; sweeping crumbs off tables, wiping down chairs, before running the shitty Henry-Hoover over the sticky floor. 

It was nearly half eight when I got done, and all the play centre staff had left. I sighed. I was so tired, and the constant smell of nappies grated on my senses. Waiting for me upstairs was the wreckage of a birthday party. Garish cellophane and dishevelled party hats were strewn over the floor. I crouched down and crawled inside the jungle gym itself. Cake crumbs and sticky fingerprints were smeared across the interlocking foam flooring and walls. I cleared as much as I could, before shuffling back out of the cramped tunnel to empty the pan. 

It takes a lot to gross me out these days. What I noticed in the pan didn’t gross me out as such, but gave me pause. Amidst the party crumbs was a single strand of human hair. There’s nothing abnormal in that; kids pull each other’s hair out all the time. The weird thing is that this hair was silver. 

Wrinkling my nose, I lowered the dustpan into the cafe bin. Someone’s grandma must have followed their grandchild into the squishy tunnel and got stuck. Maybe they had smuggled in some red wine to pass the time, while their infant threw themselves at other kids and into ball pits for hours. It must have been a very small old lady who could fit in there. 

Once the crumbs were clear, I shuffled back out of the tunnel. It wasn’t easy; even at five foot five, I was too long for the environment and ended up back-crawling out of the warren like a fat badger. The soft play’s cushions were warm to the touch, but it was freezing in the cafe area. I pulled my jacket closer over my uniform. If the janitors had turned the central heating off, I was probably the only person left onsite. I never thought I cared about working late, but the idea of the empty swimming pools and miles of deserted corridors gave me a creepy feeling. I’d never been at the Leisure centre this late before. Maybe that’s why my soul left my body when I caught sight of a leering face out of the corner of my eyes. 

It was, of course, only the beetle-bin; its plastic mouth  incapable of anything more than a shit-eating grin. Laughing, I sauntered over to it and produced another cloth from my pocket. I sprayed the synthetic cheek with blue window cleaning fluid and scrubbed coffee spots off the white cast teeth. 

“Why would they put this in a kids’ play centre?” Don’t get me wrong; the hideous, sordid creature was probably charming when it was new. In its present state, only Russ McKamey would choose it for furniture. The sleazy effect was not helped by the slogan slapped on the wall above in yellow bubble-writing: Can you find the tunnel Wig?

I fucking hope not. I finished polishing the bin, and reached to unscrew its grey head. I carefully held my breath as I ducked close to its mouth to prevent the damp, rotten smell of the rubbish from invading my senses. It did not. 

I jumped back from the beetle-bin. Its many limbs were fixed in a perpetual shrug. You get used to freaky stenches when you clean for a living, but this smell was different. Think sickly-sweet birthday cake frosting, mixed with banana peels and those button mushrooms that languish at the bottom of the vegetable draw. Think mould furring on apples, or a halloween pumpkin left out in the rain until January. 

What the hell were they putting in there? I peered at the bin with renewed caution. It probably hadn’t been changed in months. I double-gloved my hands and craned my neck back as I reached forward to carefully unscrew the beetle’s head. Had someone brought their hamster in, only for it to escape and die at the bottom of the barrel? It smelled too sweet to be a carcass, but as I inched closer and closer to the beetle-bin, I reconsidered. Sweaty hands closed round suppurating peaches. A stomach distended from a manic binge. The devil’s smoothie. It actually made my head swim as I placed my hands on the Beetle’s smiling cheeks and slowly unscrewed the top. 

The black plastic rustled, and a waft of death assaulted my senses. I turned my nose away, pressed my lips together and coiled the bin bag closed around my finger. Slowly, I lifted it, only to find that the liner was stuck to the bin’s bottom. Whatever was making the unholy smell had leaked through the plastic and solidified. 

“Oh God,” I gingerly shook the bin to loosen it, to no avail. No wonder Nadia never changes it, I thought, they should just chuck this in a skip. It was too far behind the cafe area to get proper use anyway, yet I could not (in good conscience) neglect my duties by leaving the spoiled bag in situ. Kids use this space. Whatever was in the bag, it wasn’t safe. Besides, I didn’t want Nadia to think I had half-arsed it (or Craig, for that matter.)

“Come on, come on,” I whispered, half to the beetle and half to myself. That was when I felt it: a sharp, piercing stinging on the back of my clenched palm. It was acute, like a dog bite, but as I pulled my hand away with a cry, it oozed until my whole hand throbbed.

“What the fuck?!” I staggered back, pressing hard on my hand that shrieked in pain. I lifted my fingers for a second to see if my skin was broken. I turned my hand over, then back again, looking for a welt or a cut. Not only was there no blood–but there was no mark to be seen at all. Worse still was the feeling that succeeded; a cold, prickly realisation, like sweat breaking on my brow, that I was not alone. 

My nerve broke like a twig beneath my feet. I kicked the hoover back into the cleaning cupboard. grabbed my cleaning caddy and hared out of there. I thundered down the stairs and back into the reception bay, before jamming the key code in and throwing back the door. I didn’t stop running until I got to the cloakroom. Just as I pulled my bag over my shoulder, I realised how absurd the whole thing was. I stood there, panting, and checking my hand over again. Nothing. 
I sighed, and trudged back to reception to clock out. I scribbled something down in the incident book. If there was some kind of biting-bug infestation in the beetle-bin, there was no way the play centre was fit for public use. Perhaps the closing mechanism on the lid was rusted and my hand had caught on the hinge. That explained it. The stench…well, that would be gone as soon as the janitor team saw my note in the maintenance book. They’d just cart the bin off and hurl it in the landfill, where it belonged. As for the creepy feeling? That was me, I thought, just being a scaredy little bitch. 

These explanations are so rational that I can almost bring myself to believe them. Thing is, I’m on the bus to work now to start the next shift. Has anyone got any idea what might be in that beetle-bin that stinks so horribly? Ideally I don’t want to hear suggestions about severed limbs or dead kids. I’d feel a lot better if I knew what to tell the janitors so they take it away asap. If anyone’s come across anything like this before, please let me know if you can. 

Thanks for reading. Once again, sorry for any typos. I’m writing this on my phone. I’ll post an update tomorrow sometime if anything else weird happens.

I don’t want to bore anyone with my long-winded tales of adventure, but I’ll do my best cutting-to-the-chase. One scorching summer day of training in a cumin-stenched wasteland somewhere along the border between America (US) and Mexico (MX), I soon found myself separated from my unit somehow not of my own incompetence, full of hate but nowhere to express my hate glands, much like you would a bichon’s anal glands when she leaves marks on your coffee table doily. To my relief, I discovered a strange fruit that the locals in where I believed to be deep in the jungles of the Yucatán called “dong chong xia cao”, or what we in the Great American States would be more familiar with: Cordyceps sinensis. 

Although those strange words were practically Mexican to a peanut-and-chicken-bred Georgian (U.S.) such as myself, I had familiarity with this fruit of the groin, as I had learned through my escapades through the Da Nang Valley as a covert agent of a well-funded subversion team that this prized Latin-sounding seed would, once consumed and digested, cause quite the stir within the crotch of my hiking shorts, so much so that buttons not designed to snap would I snap, opening a chasm to split, bursting forth a phalxhehridwla$:!",1,1740390508.0,OnCinemaAtTheCinema,0,1.0,False

Can you please help me restore this piece of furniture? This is my first time restoring instead of upcycling, so I need some guidance.

I picked up these drawers yesterday and found the original online (see the photo). I have the following questions for you:

1 Is the black color a type of paint? It doesn’t feel like regular paint to the touch—it’s super smooth and has a ""film-like"" texture. I need to repaint the whole piece as there are some chips on the legs (see the photo).

2 I sanded the top, but I plan to restore it to its original color. What should I use? I attached a photo of the sanded top and the sides before sanding so you can see the color comparison.

3 There are also two small chips on the top surface. How can I fix them so they blend in with the rest?

4 What is the best way to clean the pulls and the lock?

5 Lastly, are these locks glued in place? I was planning to remove them before repainting and then reattach them, but I don’t want to damage the wood.

Thank you in advance!",1,1740390311.0,furniturerestoration,0,1.0,False
1iwycp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_infinityguests-/comments/1iwycp7/whats_the_key_to_unlock_local_business_success/,What’s the Key to Unlock Local Business Success Online?,"In today’s digital landscape, having a strong online presence is crucial for businesses of all sizes. Whether you run a local café, a law firm, or an e-commerce store, your potential customers are searching for your services online. This is where Mississauga SEO comes into play. 

If you’re a business owner in Mississauga, understanding and implementing SEO strategies tailored to your local audience can give you a significant edge over competitors. 

Let’s explore why **Mississauga SEO** is essential and how you can leverage it to grow your business.

**Why Is SEO Important for Mississauga Businesses?**

Mississauga is one of Canada’s fastest-growing cities, with a thriving economy and a diverse consumer base. With such a competitive business environment, standing out online is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. Here’s why:

1. Increased Local Visibility

When someone searches for a product or service in Mississauga, Google prioritizes local businesses in search results. If your website is not optimized for local SEO, you’re missing out on potential customers. Ranking high in local search results ensures that your business is easily found by people looking for what you offer.

2. Higher Website Traffic and Conversions

SEO isn’t just about getting more visitors to your site; it’s about attracting the right audience. When your site ranks well for relevant keywords like “best coffee shop in Mississauga” or “Mississauga SEO services,” you attract users who are genuinely interested in your products or services. This leads to higher conversion rates and increased revenue.

3. Competitive Advantage

Many businesses in Mississauga still rely on traditional marketing methods. While those can be effective, SEO provides a long-term competitive advantage by keeping your brand visible 24/7. If your competitors are investing in SEO and you’re not, you risk losing potential customers to them.

**How to Improve Your Mississauga SEO Strategy?**

Now that we understand why SEO is important, let’s dive into some actionable strategies to help your business rank higher in local search results.

1. Optimize Your Google My Business Listing

One of the most effective ways to improve local SEO is by optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) profile. This ensures that your business appears in Google’s local pack, maps, and search results.

* Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate and consistent across all platforms.
* Choose the right categories and add high-quality images.
* Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews.

2. Focus on Local Keywords

Keywords are the foundation of any SEO strategy. To target the Mississauga market, include location-based keywords naturally throughout your website content.

Examples of local keywords:

* “Best digital marketing agency in Mississauga”
* “Affordable SEO services in Mississauga”
* “Mississauga SEO expert”

Using these keywords in your website’s headings, meta descriptions, and content will help improve local rankings.

3. Create High-Quality Local Content

Content marketing is a powerful tool for boosting SEO. By creating valuable, locally focused content, you can attract and engage your audience while improving your rankings.

4. Build Local Backlinks

Backlinks (links from other websites to yours) play a crucial role in SEO. Acquiring backlinks from reputable Mississauga-based websites can improve your domain authority and search rankings.

5. Ensure Mobile-Friendliness and Fast Loading Speed

Most users today browse the internet from mobile devices. If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you could be losing potential customers. Google also considers page speed as a ranking factor, so ensure your site loads quickly and offers a seamless user experience.

6. Leverage Social Media for Local Engagement

While social media doesn’t directly impact SEO rankings, it helps drive traffic to your website and builds brand authority. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn allow you to engage with the Mississauga community, promote your content, and attract local customers.

**Choosing the Right Mississauga SEO Company**

If SEO sounds overwhelming, hiring a professional **Mississauga SEO** agency can be a smart investment. An experienced SEO agency can:

* Conduct in-depth keyword research and competitor analysis.
* Optimize your website for local searches.
* Create a tailored content strategy.
* Build high-quality backlinks to improve rankings.
* Monitor performance and adjust strategies for continuous growth.

When selecting an SEO agency, look for one with a proven track record, positive client testimonials, and experience in local SEO.

**The Summary**

[Mississauga SEO](https://www.thirdeyedesigners.com/mississauga-seo/) is more than just ranking higher on Google—it’s about connecting with your local audience, building trust, and driving business growth. As you implement the right SEO strategies, you can enhance your online presence, attract more customers, and stay ahead of the competition.

Whether you choose to optimize your website on your own or hire an expert, investing in SEO is one of the best decisions you can make for your business in Mississauga. Start today and watch your brand thrive in the digital space!

Birds were chirping like a well-rehearsed orchestra, beautifully harmonized, as if they were performing at a sold-out theater. Sunlight sneaked into my room, gently caressing my eyelids like a mother waking her child for school. I groggily opened my eyes, peeked through the window, and behold—a beautiful day. The weather was perfect. I smiled at the world, appreciating its warm welcome into a new day.



Feeling the good vibes, I brewed a cup of coffee, toasted some bread, and cooked an egg like a civilized human being. Then, as if my body had been pre-programmed, I instinctively booted up my computer and launched Wuthering Waves. After grinding through my dailies, I was hyped for the newly unlocked stage in the multiplayer event. Since I was in such a great mood, I decided to pick Encore as my resonator because, well, I felt just as cheerful as she is.



Matchmaking found a game, and we were off! I rushed to the first booster—only to realize I was in last place. Just as I was about to grab my well-deserved speed boost, a guy (using Shorekeeper) swooped in and snatched not one but BOTH of the boosters, leaving me behind, rooting alone in despair.



Alright, no big deal. I pressed on, hoping for a chance to catch up. I spotted the next booster up ahead—but wait. SK was just standing there. Suspicious. What was he doing? Praying? Meditating? Telepathically communicating with a sentinel? Whatever. I ignored him and went for my booster—only for him to snatch it AGAIN.



At this point, I realized: that SK wasn’t playing to win. He was playing to ruin my life. He kept waiting for me at every booster, only to steal them away at the last second. It was like watching a villain in a Saturday morning cartoon—except I was the only one suffering.



And just like that, my perfect morning crumbled. My day? Ruined. My mood? Obliterated. My trust in humanity? Shattered.

I'm looking to start a casual book club here in Bangkok for anyone who enjoys reading and wants to discuss books in a relaxed setting. The idea is simple:

We pick a book each month.

We chat about it on WhatsApp throughout the month.

If there's interest, we can meet up at the end of the month for coffee or a drink to wrap up our thoughts.


No pressure, just a fun way to read more and meet people with similar interests. Open to all genres—fiction, non-fiction, classics, whatever the group is into!

Right now, I'm reading:

Eversion by Alastair Reynolds

The Trial by Kafka

Cycle of Arawan 

The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin

Mindful Learning by Ellen J. Langer



If any of those interest you or if you have other suggestions, let’s get a group going! Drop a comment or DM me, and I'll set up the WhatsApp group.

Hope to read with some of you soon!

I was invited to admin a site long after it was created. At one point in time things happened and we all got locked out our account, thus I needed to access plugins directly and disable some of them. For that purpose I was granted a [10web.io](http://10web.io) access.

At that point of my life I was a hard worker with big dreams. I worked in construction part time while starting a computer flipping business which created some decent money. I’ve never drank or did any drugs or even drank coffee my entire life. I have has soda but I usually choose water over soda. Around my 16th birthday my godfather past away and I had to travel to Mexico for the funeral (I live in the IS). I ate something there that made my stomach very upset and caused me to throw up the entire day of my birthday. After that I noticed that my intestines had a lot of pain every week. I also had mild acid reflux every 2 days. Then after 2 months of the pain I suddenly got another stomach bug that stayed in my stomach for almost a month now looking back it might’ve been the pepto bismol causing me to not recover fast.

I was sent to the hospital almost a month after I got the stomach bug cause I lost 40 pounds.I noticed that I had frequent acid reflux during and after that bug. Then around September 2022 my gallbladder decided to create human made stones. I ended up getting my gallbladder removed, but the gallbladder removal took my acid reflux to a whole other level. I finally got a GI doctor around late 2022. They did an endoscopy and found I had h pylori. I ended up going through 2 rounds and several months of antibiotics which were pretty awful I looked like I was dying and felt like I was dying. Thankfully I did not have h pylori after that my entire family got an h pylori test too but no one tested positive.

After that I had 4 rounds of omeprazole 20mg/40mg treatment with not much change. My diet gradually became extremely strict I usually ate peanuts, bananas, and mangos as a snack and for the meals I ate chicken with broccoli, carrots, avocados, and baked potatoes. I don’t put seasoning on my food if I want my food to taste better I usually add cilantro. I’m currently on pantoprazole 20mg but still no progress. In the past year I’ve done small progress but it almost seems like I can’t get under a curtain line, like I’m stuck if that makes sense. No matter if I have a good meal I’ll still have acid reflux. At least I’ve fixed my intestinal pain issues that I’ve mentioned earlier with the vegetables.

I’m now turning 19 in a week and that means it’s been 3 years since I was throwing up all over the place. GERD has deeply effected my life I’m not the same person I was and I miss. It deeply effected my education and caused me to graduate much later. It’s unfortunately caused me to loose best friends I’ve had people tell me that my illness is too much for them so they don’t wanna be friends anymore. Since my parents move around a lot I ended up being isolated cause I usually never went out. I couldn’t seem to keep a regular sleeping schedule so that caused me to be too unreliable to go get a job or go to school I had to go Into independent studies and get a 504 plan. I’m trying to find a job that fits my needs through a program but I have no idea if this will work it’s just a leap of faith.

An additional piece of information that I’ve been thinking recently might be related to the GERD is that I live in a toxic and abusive household and have been since I was a baby. I remember my doctors saying GERD can be connected to stress. Maybe my unsafe living environment might be contributing to my GERD but I can’t tell it feels like I can manage my stress and emotions very well by just putting on headphones and listening to music but no amount of music stops my GERD. I used to been a nervous wreck but I’ve learned to manage it in the past year. Thank you to anyone who has read this long story thoroughly 🙃 If you have any questions I am happy to answer.

Michelle and I (27f) have worked together for two years now, she is sweet and kind and always has the best intentions. Her fiancé broke up with her last week and I’ve been hanging out with her a little more lately because she’s heart broken and today I went over to help her pack her exes things. 

I’ve been awake since 1:00 in the morning and she knows this and it’s 12 in the afternoon when I get to her house. She says we should go eat somewhere so we do and we invite her brother to come with us. Mind you I haven’t eaten all day and she HAS to take a picture of everything. We ordered some drinks and she took a picture, our food came out and I was about to dive in and she said hold up I need a picture and I got hangry and maybe a little visibly angry. Like I just wanted to eat! But ok, she’s heart broken and she needs to post it so everyone who knows her ex can say she’s not phased. 

So it’s now around 3:00, and she talks about going to play pool so we try this one place and can’t get in because her brother is underage. So we say, let’s go to the next town then they invite her other friend and as we’re waiting for her the sleepiness is starting to get to me. I told them that I’ve been awake since 1:00 and everyone including Michelle is like “whaaat??” So we get coffee and it works a little bit, we go back to Michelle’s house so I can get my car and we talk to her mom for a little bit. 

We get into town and it’s around 5:00 and she calls me and says “can we stop by the car dealership real fast?” So we get to Mercedes and we’re looking around then she says let’s go across the street to bmw so we’re looking around.

she finds a car she really likes and it’s now 6:00 and the dealerships are closed and I say “let me go get my car” I bring it over to where they were and they’re gone. Michelle calls me and says she has to take her friend home and I should probably go home to because I’m tired and I say yeah. So I go home and fall asleep and wake up at 11:00 and see she text me “hey do you want to hang out with me and Stephanie” from 3 hours ago and that made me a little mad. I’m tired, I’m sleeping and I already saw you and you want to hang out again even though you know I’m tired? 

Now me, I’m going through a little something with a man right now, its been on and off for a couple months and it hasn’t been good, I know that. I really value my alone time, I want to be home and heal instead of going out and looking for another person. I’m not a big drinker anymore, we had two drinks together and I already felt like throwing up and anxious. But now that she’s single she’s talking about being in her hot girl era and going out and drinking and I don’t have to drink. But I don’t have the money to always go out and if I don’t drink then I’ll just be taking care of drunk people all the time and that’s not fun… but she is heart broken and maybe she needs to do that. 

I don’t know why but her, as she says, “girly pop era” makes me mad and i know it shouldn’t. It’s just anywhere we go she says “oh I like this! It’s so girly pop!” “This is so boujee I want it” “whatever I’m in my hot girl era” “gotta take a pic for the gram!” “Omg we should go eat here and here” In a heavy valley girl accent. 

The thing that scares me is she seems dependent on other people. She says a couple years ago her and her friend Jennifer used to hang out everyday and talk about their days every day. I think she’s going to put that energy on me and I can’t do that I don’t even talk to my family that much.

1iwxy61,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iwxy61,"Second Time in Paris, and I’m Even More in Love","Bonjour, Parisiens,

I just returned from my second trip to your incredible city, and I’m still buzzing from how amazing it was. I wanted to take a moment to share how much Paris means to me and to thank everyone who makes it such a special place.

First of all, the people. Parisians, you are the soul of this city. I know there’s a stereotype out there about Paris being unfriendly, but that hasn’t been my experience at all. From the kind server who patiently helped me practice my French (*""Un café, s’il vous plaît"" -* I’m getting there!) to the stranger who pointed me in the right direction when I looked lost (*""C’est par là!""*), I’ve always felt welcomed here. There’s a quiet confidence and warmth in the way people carry themselves, and it makes the city feel alive in the best way.

And then there’s the city itself. Paris, you are breathtaking. Every corner feels like it’s straight out of a postcard, but in the most authentic way. The way the light hits the Seine in the evening (*la lumière est magnifique!*), the way the cobblestone streets seem to tell stories, the way the Eiffel Tower peeks out at you when you least expect it.. it’s all so magical. This time, I made sure to slow down and really soak it all in. I spent hours just wandering, letting myself get lost in the charm of your neighborhoods. *Flâner* might just be my new favorite word.

I’ve always been obsessed with fashion, and Paris is like the ultimate playground for that. The style here is so effortless, so *chic*. It’s not about trying too hard, it’s about owning who you are and looking good while doing it. I spent way too much time (and money) in Le Marais and Saint-Germain-des-Prés, but honestly, it was worth every penny. *C’est la vie!*

What I love most, though, is the lifestyle. There’s a rhythm to life here that feels so balanced. People take the time to enjoy their meals (*bon appétit!*), to sit and talk, to appreciate the little things. It’s such a refreshing change from the rush of everyday life back home. I’ll never forget the mornings I spent at a corner café, sipping coffee and watching the world go by. Or the evenings spent picnicking by the Seine, surrounded by laughter and music. *C’était parfait.*

This trip, I made it a point to explore beyond the usual spots, and I’m so glad I did. Canal Saint-Martin and Belleville were such gems, quieter, more local, but still so full of life. It reminded me that Paris isn’t just a city; it’s a collection of a million little moments and places, each with its own story.

So, to the people of Paris: *merci* for sharing your city with the world. To the city itself: *tu es magnifique.* And to anyone thinking about visiting: don’t hesitate. Paris has a way of staying with you long after you leave.

*À bientôt, Paris.*",23,1740388376.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False
1iwxv1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1iwxv1a/emotionally_immature_parents_as_grandparents/,Emotionally immature parents as grandparents?,"How do you cope with having emotionally immature parents, specifically a mother, and having kids? My situation is such, I am married and we have a baby girl who soon turns 10 months old. We live with my parents and grandparents. We have two houses on the properity, we live in the one with my parents, my mothers parents in the other. We mostly live here to help around the properity and houses.

My mother has always been emotionally immature, I started realizing it when I went to a psychologist at 16 yo. because I was having suicidal thoughts and she just didn't care. She refused to talk to me about it or let me look for comfort from her. We have always had a rocky relationship but I started realizing what sort of a person she actually is around 17-18, when I would talk to her about healing our relationship. She would flat out deny there is anything wrong, she would just make it all about her, end up saying things like ""I guess I'm the worst mother ever"" or telling me I'm selfish etc. I am almost 30 and I have given up having these talks with her and understood I cannot fix something she denies needs fixing.

I have never had my mother babysit my daughter, she has never shown interest in it either. As we live together you would think it would be natural she would want to help, feed, put her to sleep, go for walks etc. None of this. She doesn't even offer to ""babysit"" while I'm cooking or doing laundry etc. If we have had outtings, me and my husband leave our daughter with his mother, who is just amazing btw. We have left her there overnight too with zero problems. 

I have babyproofed as much as the house as I can. My mother just doesn't seem to care thought. I vaccum everyday, try to keep floors clean af. She does none of this! She is a grade 1 hoarder and has ""piles"" everywhere, if I hadnt yelled and made a deal about it for multiple months (coming up to baby being able to crawl) her things were just all over the place. Now every empty ledge and counterspace is full of her piles. 

Today I was answering an email and my daughter stood up next to the coffee table where my mother had just placed a hot cup of coffee onto THE EDGE! I did not see her do it as I was focused on my email at the moment. Of course my daughter grabs the cup and spills it all over the carpet, table etc. Luckily it didn't spill on her and she escaped with no burns etc. I immediately asked my mother why she placed her HOT coffee on the edge of the table as she knows my daughter is grabbing and throwing everything she can at this stage. She answered ""sorry for even existing"", not even apologizing for the actual action at hand. I barked back that its such a silly response, that she should own up to her mistake and not repeat it. She looked me up and down and starts blabbing about ""if you fix your mistakes too then i'll think about fixing mine"", even smirking like she was saying something so smart and ""getting back at me"" type of vibe. She also blamed me for not watching my daughter thus why the whole thing happend. I admit I was occupied but I baby proofed this living room and did not see her put the cup on the table. This just infuriates me. She didnt even initiate to clean the split coffee or help, she just made herself another cup of coffee while my husband had to clean the coffee. And she now plays the silent game with me. 

How do these people even exist. ",2,1740388000.0,emotionalneglect,1,1.0,False

Reality checks are welcome.

For Christmas a year ago, my spouse gave me a cup with the text ""my favourite person"". I loved it, and whenever i was feeling insecure i would use that cup for my coffee and be happy thinking i was ""the favourite"".

Now i do not believe love can be quantified and compared really. But my spouse is still my favourite. That is why i am married to him. I still absolutely love my boyfriend. 

Yesterday i found a box that the cup had arrived in, it made me smile and i showed my spouse. He then informed me that he had gotten the same cup for his two other partners. 

I am absolutely crushed. I loved that cup and it was so special to me. And now i feel it ment nothing to him.

I would never give the exact same gifts to several parters like that. It feels disrespectful and like i am just one of many. 

My spouse feels that i am blowing it completly out of proportions. It is just a cup. And he says that me wanting to be the favourite leaves a bad taste in his mouth. That he doesnt want to compare partners like that. 

I feel like i am not asking him to compare partners. But that i want to feel special. I dont believe all partners can be equal, we all have completly different relationships that cant be compared to eachother. And him giving the same gift, that ment so much to me, to others as well makes me feel like i am replaceable and nothing special to him.

Please do not come here and suggest I take a class, or sell baked goods. That is ablist, unsupportive, and upsetting.

A little about me:

📖 I love world-building and have probably started thousands of stories, though finishing them is another matter entirely! One day, I’d love to write a solar-punk slice-of-life fantasy with Studio Ghibli vibes, something about everyday people just trying to live a good, meaningful life. I prefer stories about regular people over “chosen ones,” and I read *a lot* of fanfiction across all sorts of genres.

☕ You’ll usually find me reading history books (currently on A History of Private Life, Vol. 1: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium), drinking too much coffee with oat milk, or editing vintage house plans for fun; even if they’d never work in real life. It’s oddly meditative.

🧠 I have been diagnosed with ADHD and likely autism (several therapists have suggested I get tested, but I don't exactly have the fungibles for testing right now), so I’d love to connect with other neurodivergent individuals. I’m also progressive, so if you lean further right than left of (U.S.) center, we probably won’t be a good match.

🏡 Right now, I’m working on law school applications and looking for temporary work until I can (hopefully!) move out of Florida. Although, the job market here is kind of barren at the moment. My dream destinations? Oregon, Washington, Northern California, the Northeast, or maybe even the UK or Spain.

🐶 I’m an indoor cat with three dogs, introverted but always up for deep, silly, or philosophical conversations. I’d love to know if you have a strong opinion on something completely insignificant (like, is cream cheese superior to butter on toast, and are you willing to fight to the death to defend that absurd opinion?).

💬 I have basic proficiency in Spanish and would love to improve. I understand much more than I can actually speak, so if anyone is interested in chatting over the phone to help me practice, I’d be up for that!

💜 I’m a cisgender woman, minromantic, and demisexual and have no dating or relationship experience. I'd like to make friends with people who can relate. While I am open to finding a future partner, building lasting friendships are at the forefront of my mind. I’d like to connect with people close in age, preferably within five years of my own (so 25 to 35), but I won’t protest if you skew a bit older.

📬 I’d like to start with emails or casual chat and move to letters once we build a solid rapport and I feel safe enough to hand out my address. An international pen pal could be fun too!

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message. I’d love to hear about your world, your passions, or just your favorite way to drink coffee! 😊",2,1740387264.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

But I like these frames and I DONT WANNA REPLACE THEM. I'm still legal to drive. But I want better vision BUT i WANT THESE FRAMES.

A little about me:

📖 I love world-building and have probably started thousands of stories, though finishing them is another matter entirely! One day, I’d love to write a solar-punk slice-of-life fantasy with Studio Ghibli vibes, something about everyday people just trying to live a good, meaningful life. I prefer stories about regular people over “chosen ones,” and I read *a lot* of fanfiction across all sorts of genres.

☕ You’ll usually find me reading history books (currently on A History of Private Life, Vol. 1: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium), drinking too much coffee with oat milk, or editing vintage house plans for fun; even if they’d never work in real life. It’s oddly meditative.

🧠 I have been diagnosed with ADHD and likely autism (several therapists have suggested I get tested, but I don't exactly have the fungibles for testing right now), so I’d love to connect with other neurodivergent individuals. I’m also progressive, so if you lean further right than left of (U.S.) center, we probably won’t be a good match.

🏡 Right now, I’m working on law school applications and looking for temporary work until I can (hopefully!) move out of Florida. Although, the job market here is kind of barren at the moment. My dream destinations? Oregon, Washington, Northern California, the Northeast, or maybe even the UK or Spain.

🐶 I’m an indoor cat with three dogs, introverted but always up for deep, silly, or philosophical conversations. I’d love to know if you have a strong opinion on something completely insignificant (like, is cream cheese superior to butter on toast, and are you willing to fight to the death to defend that absurd opinion?).

💬 I have basic proficiency in Spanish and would love to improve. I understand much more than I can actually speak, so if anyone is interested in chatting over the phone to help me practice, I’d be up for that!

💜 I’m a cisgender woman, minromantic, and demisexual and have no dating or relationship experience. I'd like to make friends with people who can relate. While I am open to finding a future partner, building lasting friendships are at the forefront of my mind.

📬 I’d like to start with emails or casual chat and move to letters once we build a solid rapport and I feel safe enough to hand out my address. An international pen pal could be fun too!

If any of this resonates with you, send me a message. I’d love to hear about your world, your passions, or just your favorite way to drink coffee! 😊",1,1740386651.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

I'm also a bit on the awkward and weird side. My crush is the most perfect person i've ever met. Curly brown hair, big brown eyes, funny personality, and way more popular than I am.

We both CO-OP and me and my crush are both in high school. They are a senior and are leaving this year, and I think I will never forgive myself if I don't tell them I like them. It was September 18th, 2024 when they sat next to me on a couch during a club we were both starting. It's called Key Club, (You can look it up if you're interested) and we immediately started talking. I found out we were fairly similar. We both like the same artist, have read the same books, have the same beliefs. Unfortunately this club only meets twice a month and you only have to go to one meeting a month. So, I don't see them as often as I wish I would. I kept saying that if they were the one to let me see them again, and i'm not fucking joking the same day I walk into a coffee shop that I had been going to for ages, and they were working there! 

At first they showed no interest rest in me. It took them weeks to reply to messages, but when I saw them at Key Club they were as perfect as ever. As time has gone by though, i've started to hint at liking them and they have done to same back. We stare at each other during Key Club, we always sit next to each other (And I mean like thighs touching close), and they have gotten better at texting me back. I know so much about them. The other day they told me about this girl who was hitting on them by adding them to their close friends list of Instagram only after knowing them for a week or two, (Obviously that means they correlate someone doing that to having a crush) and I kid you not the next day they added me to their close friends list. Also, they reply to a lot of my stories on Instagram too. Their texts are a little dry though. Sometimes it can take them hours on end to respond, but other than that they are perfect.

 We are friends and i'm scared to screw up what we already have. Should I tell them? Do they like me back?",1,1740386635.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1iwxiq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1iwxiq5/am_i_wrong_feeling_useless_and_pushing_mam_too/,Am I wrong? Feeling Useless and Pushing Mam Too Soon?,"Hey folks,
 
I need a bit of help to see if I’m totally out of line, slightly off the mark, or bang on the money. This could get long but I’ll try my best to keep it short.

 
Our first will be 5 months old later this week, and this feeling of “being useless” is starting to really build.
 

At the moment, I’m doing everything I can to support my wife in the day to day. She’s still on Mat leave with me working M-F during the day, but our system is that I’ll take the wee man from 4am (or whenever he wakes up) until about 07:15-07:30 when I need to leave for work at which time I’ll pop him back into my wife.

 
When I get back I’ll usually take him from her for an hour or 90 minute before doing some house admin (bottles, cleaning, dinner, bins, etc etc) while my wife puts him to sleep for 7pm. She hates those jobs and I don’t mind them which is why we landed on that model.
 

At the weekend all pretty much remains unchanged accept I’d keep him in the mornings until she woke up to let her get a lie in.

 
All in all, this has worked broadly well, however since my son has been born, I feel like I’m “fighting” my wife to stick to this.

 
She wants me to have some downtime after work when I get home so is resistant to give me him. She also wants to make sure I get enough sleep so often wont wake me if the wee man starts to stir beyond 4am and just manage it herself.

 
In the last couple of weeks, we’re trying to get him into a sleeping routine and she asked that I drop him back up to her on weekends, too, with a big factor for her being to “give me some time to myself”. I did this for a couple of days but one morning I genuinely just forgot, kept him myself, and we’ve kinda not looked back on that since.

 
Before my boy ever arrived, I was concerned that this would happen, and we both agreed on a few key milestones.

 
1.       We’d leave him with a family member for 30-40 minutes before January 1st so we can go on a quick coffee date.
2.       She’d start a once-a-week yoga class in January at any time during the week that she wanted.
 

Neither of these have happened yet despite me (softly) trying to push her in that direction.

 
Then, yesterday, it all came to a bit of a head. The LO is teething at the moment and in the mornings and evenings, he’s in a foul mood. This has ment that the last 7 days have been personally rough because their the only times I get to see him during the week. But that’s parenthood.


Yesterday morning, though, after about 5 hours of meltdowns, my wife got out of bed and I was just wiped. I had to go to bed for a couple of hours nap.

 
When I woke up I had this feeling of just being useless, essentially because while I know I’m helping, my wife isn’t getting the breaks away from my son like I am.

 
I ended up, softly, bringing all this up yesterday evening, and while it was met with openness to discuss, I could tell my wife’s brain was going 100 miles an hour. One thing that stuck out to me at  the time was that she said “I am the primary caregiver” – as in, I wasn’t. It wasn’t ment as a dig, just an insight into how she seen the dynamic.

 
The conversation ended in a positive tone, and while we knew there was more to talk about, we ended up having a nice evening together.

 
Then, this morning, my son woke at 4am, and as I got up to get him all I got was a “I have him”, in a tone that I knew not to push. She got him back asleep.

 
Same at 5am.

 
I asked if she was ok, she said she was awake since 12, thinking about our conversation, and was upset. I asked if she wanted to talk about it, but she said not now. Her tone was hostile.

 
Eventually 6am came around and I got out of bed, asking her if I could take him with me. She said no, “she had him”.

 
About 30 minutes later, they both get up and get started for the day.

 
At this stage, I’m feeling even more useless then ever, realising that there was some weight in her caregiver comment, and just decided not to push it any more until I got home from work. I went to do some yoga. As I was getting my mat from the kitchen she asked if I wanted to hold him, and a conversation started.

 
Turns out what I had said was incredibly hurtful to her, but I’m not sure why. She then also threw out some other things that have apparently been on her mind, so there’s definitely some underlying annoyance on her side which I’ll need to dig into.

 
My question for you all is – am I out of line here? Am I pushing her too hard, too soon, and being selfish? Or am I right to be pushing her to take a hour a week for herself this early into parenthood?

 
Our relationship is incredibly strong. We’re normally very open and proactive with conversations and very vary rarely do we argue. I feel like the solution is simple and a single conversation based on solid foundation with some small tweeks moving forward would put this all to bed, but I need to know if I’m on the money or just wrong to know what that foundation is.
 

Am I going insane?

1iwxhes,https://www.reddit.com/r/medschoolph/comments/1iwxhes/how_to_help_a_struggling_friend/,How to help a struggling friend,"[Incoming rambling]

Mid-semester, I’ve noticed a growing distance between me and a close friend. It feels like they’re still struggling to adjust, and I don’t know how to bridge the gap.

I never flaunt my grades—I just nod along when people say an exam was impossible—but my friend seems to see through that. Lately, they’ve been avoiding me more and more whenever results come out. We used to study together at coffee shops, but now they keep declining. Sure, maybe they just prefer studying alone, but something about it feels off.

It also seems like they’re avoiding me because of the people I hang out with. I’ve gotten closer to classmates who are also doing well, and I can’t help but wonder if that’s making them feel even more distant. Whenever grades are released, there’s this awkward tension between us, like an unspoken divide neither of us wants to address. I can feel them pulling away, and if I try to call them back when we’re in a group, they just say they’re tired. They used to be so excited about studying and hanging out, but now... it’s like their spark is gone.

It doesn’t help that they’ll use the introvert excuse whenever I ask if something’s wrong. I get that people need space, but it feels like a convenient way to shut down any real conversation. On top of that, they struggle socially—they're not the type to easily connect with others, and I know med school has been overwhelming for them in more ways than one. They’re also pretty rigid when it comes to studying, sticking to the same methods even when they’re not working. I want to help them find a better way to study, but I don’t know how to suggest it without making them feel worse.

The thing is, I genuinely like being around them. They’re not just a study buddy—they’re my friend, and I don’t want to lose them over this. I don’t know if I should reach out or give them space, and now that grades are out, I have no idea how to comfort them. Am I overreacting? Has anyone else been in this situation?

1iwxhcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1iwxhcw/restrospective_jealousy/,Restrospective jealousy,"I, 31 F have been with my boyfriend 34 M for 2 years. We have known each other for 16 years due to him being a close friend to my family. Since I’ve known him, he has dated maybe around 5 girls, 1 of them, a friend of mine for around 2 years but we’re not that close. During the time he was single, he would message me and ask me to go out but I have always declined, (even though I’m attracted to him) due to that friend. I know a lot of people wouldn’t even care, considering we’re not even close but for me, it’s a huge hurdle because I know what I’m like. 

I grew up in a very toxic environment with a lot of domestic abuse so I guess that made me scared of being in a relationship, so I’ve been single for the first 29 years of my life…. For me, being in a relationship seemed stressful and I guess I was kind of avoiding it too, I mean the only person that could hurt me is me really, plus I’ve been fine all these years. I just had to deal with all the “why don’t you have a boyfriend”, “are you a lesbian?” “I have someone that’s perfect for you!” Don’t get me wrong, there were a few guys that I did find attractive but I guess my standards were too high so I didn’t even bother (I realised that list of standards was absurd and was there to protect myself in a way). 

So I went out one night and something happened, he ended up helping me and got me home. From then on, the people around me kept telling me to give him a chance and after a few months of pestering, I gave in and asked him out for some coffee. The date went really well and we got to know each other properly, and I told him the reason why I never went there with him in the first place was because of his ex and how I didn’t want to deal with it but I guess I’ll let it go. So we started dating and I was genuinely happy. After a bit, I found out that he has hooked up with 2 of my friends (both from different friendship groups) and so I confronted him about it and he apologised, saying it meant nothing, during that time he thought he’ll never get a chance with me and he also gave up on the idea of settling down so that’s why he did what he did and he didn’t want to tell me at the start because he knew I wouldn’t want to be with him at all. Which is correct, if I knew all that then, I would not have asked him out for coffee. 


Fast forward to 2 years later, we’re still together but I’m still so insecure. I get it, it’s in the past but it still affects me. I found out the correct term for it is retrospective jealousy. I’ve tried listening to podcasts about it to try and better myself but it’s not really helping. He has always been a nice guy and treated everyone, girls especially really well, but that just makes me not feel special at all. He follows a lot of girls on insta and I told him I had an issue with it, especially since he’s flirted and taken them out for dinner prior to us dating and so he deleted all those girls. He also deleted all the chats and likes which made me extremely mad cause it seems like he’s hiding things but he said there’s no need to keep past chats if they mean nothing to him. Which I get too but I can’t help feel what I feel. Don’t get me wrong he treats me really well but we do have our small fights which we work through together and he also gets moody sometimes and doesn’t tell my why he’s upset because he doesn’t want to fight, so I just let him be, even though it does make me sad too. 

He use to be very active online doing twitch, discord etc, which is something I’m not familiar with and so knows and has A LOT of friends. So when I’m on social media, I’ll randomly see old posts of some of the girls he’s ’liked’(bikini photos etc), the things they say about him and, the nicknames they gave him and I’ll get triggered. I’ll question him about the girl and he’ll say they’re just friends and I do believe him but calling him “my precious (bfs name)”….It’s a bit much right? oh and he also goes out of his way to follow their pets accounts as well as their business accounts/side accounts… its just not something I would do, I have boundaries when it comes to my guy friends and I definitely would not do anything to ‘lead’ them on. 

I have really bad anxiety/social anxiety and a lot of health issues as well, so I like to keep my life simple, friendship circle small and only go out when it’s necessary. He’s helped me a lot during these past few months with all my issues but every few weeks/months, I’ll see these triggers and it’ll upset me, which is unfair for him because it’s his past. I don’t want to be like his exes and make our relationship toxic and we do love each other very much. I mean he is my first for everything but it’s just upsetting that I’m just one of many for him and I guess that’s why I’m so insecure. So now I’m at a point where I just don’t know what to do. It’s also not fair to break up with him for something that’s happened in the past, he’s been working hard trying to build a future for us but I also don’t want to burden him with insecurities.

1iwxehl,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1iwxehl/tips_for_eating_fast_food_while_losing_weight/,Tips for eating fast food while losing weight,"I love fast food and eat it several times a week. Yeah, cooking for yourself is healthier and cheaper, but it's hard to beat the convenience, and you can't really replicate certain favorites from home. And you can make weight-conscious choices even while eating out often. I've lost almost 30 lbs in the last 5 months, yet fast food has stayed a cornerstone of my diet. If I want fast food one day, I just plan my day around it so I don't exceed my calorie target.

Some tips I have to trim calorie counts on fast food meals:

* Skip the combo and get just the entree. It saves you a couple of bucks, and most of the time the side is fries, which is very heavy in calories. If you need a side, try to sub it for something less caloric. Fried chicken places like Popeyes or Golden Chick often have mashed potatoes, and even with gravy those are usually less calories than fries. If you want a drink, it's both cost- and calorie-effective to drink something at home (if you eat at home) or bring something with you in a thermos.
* And speaking of drinks, zero calorie drinks only! I haven't drank sugary soda in four years and recoil at the thought of it now. Diet soda tastes marginally worse but trims off hundreds of calories. Worth it several times over. Or you could just get water. I always only get water at sit-down restaurants, and you can ask for a water cup at any fast food or fast casual restaurant. 
* Beware of sauce. Sauces are hidden killers. Chick-Fil-A sauce is 140 calories. I used to have 3 of those with a 4-count strips meal. But the strips are just 410, so I was having more calories from sauce alone than the chicken. One Cane's sauce is 190. Skip the sauce when you can (or ask for it on the side so you can control how much you use). If you need sauce, each place's recipes are different, but usually BBQ sauce, ketchup, hot/buffalo sauce, and honey mustard are much lower than mayo, ranch, or specialty sauce. Regular mustard is the lowest. If you really want a caloric sauce, you don't have to use the whole packet.

And specific options by restaurant:

* **McDonald's:** I haven't eaten here much since the McChicken stopped being a dollar. But it's still just 390 cals, and without mayo just 290. A cheeseburger is only 300, 250 if you don't want cheese (I need cheese, myself). If you want a real sandwich, the Big Mac is 590 and just 450 without the sauce, and a quarter pounder with cheese is 520. It's hard to imagine eating something like a Big Mac without the sauce but kind of like sugary sodas, I started losing my taste for these sauces once I realized how many calories they were. For breakfast, you can't beat the Egg McMuffin (310). A hash brown (150) is also way less for a side option than fries (medium is 320).
* **Domino's/Pizza Hut/Papa John's/etc.:** Switch to thin crust. At Domino's, a cheese pizza with regular crust is 280/slice. Thin crust? Just 200. If you want a topping, go for chicken or ham over pepperoni or beef. Or better yet, veggies. They have a $10 any toppings deal right now which I just used. I put chicken and then slapped on like 6 or 7 veggies so it was pretty filling. Not going to dig into other places' menus but same concept.
* **Taco Bell:** I eat here the most. Their value boxes are good for the money but caloric. The $7 Luxe Box they have now is good and has a lot of food but is 1210 calories. You can save a bit by not eating all of the nacho cheese, but yeah, it's a meal to plan your other meals around. The value menu is better. The chicken flatbread melt (330), double stacked taco (320), and classic stacker (400) are good. The regular combo meals are rip-offs. And I haven't tried the cantina chicken bowl (540, 490 without the sauce packet) but it looks great for the food/calories ratio. (Their normal sauces are almost no calories, but watch out for the ranches/cheeses/etc.)
* **Chipotle:** Speaking of food/calories ratio, you'll probably want to maximize that to stay full and less hungry. Veggies are the easiest way to do that. I mention this under Chipotle because you can also maximize the food/price ratio here since you can ask extra of everything besides meat and guac. Last time, I got chicken, rice (you can ask light rice if you want), extra beans, extra corn, extra fajita veggies, extra lettuce, and red salsa for 890 calories. Light rice makes that 785. And if you like pico, extra pico is only 50. If you get sour cream, be careful cause they like to douse your bowl in it. Also keep in mind that portion sizes are more variable at places like Chipotle.
* **Panda Express:** And speaking of variable portion sizes, my Panda always loads my plate with rice, so I usually assume a full side of white rice (520) is more than it says. But if you get half rice half greens, that's just 325, and full greens is just 130. A half/half with double teriyaki chicken is 875 calories. I *used* to order full white rice and double orange chicken, which is 1540. The string bean chicken breast (210) and mushroom chicken (220) are good and even lower than teriyaki (275). Also the soy sauce is almost no calories, though the teriyaki sauce is 70.
* **Sonic:** I worked here years ago and employees got free drinks and shakes, so you can guess part of why I've had to lose weight. A medium slush is 250-300 cals, and I used to drink at least one during my shift and bring another home when I left, so... yeah. The problem with Sonic is that their signature items (like slushes, mozzarella sticks) are very caloric and it's hard to make calorie reducing substitutions, so you're probably best off not going to Sonic at all. A coney by itself (470) isn't bad, I guess. The burgers are a lot, too. Just the regular cheeseburger is 720, though that's with mayo so you could probably trim 50-100 by asking for no mayo. But yeah, if you're just going to get a burger, go somewhere else.
* **Subway/Jersey Mike's/Jimmy John's/etc.:** Sub places are great for maximizing the food/calorie ratio because you can get your sandwich loaded with veggies, and for (usually) no extra cost. But *watch* for sauce. Hold the olive oil if you get it Mike's way, and you'll save 250 cals. That brings down an average sub from 700-800 to 450-550. Hold the mayo too if something comes with mayo. I don't even notice it's gone. For these places, check out the menu on the app before you order so you know what's in it and where you can save, since the in-restaurant menus usually don't list all the ingredients for each sandwich.
* **Chick-Fil-A:** They have grilled chicken options. It says a grilled sandwich is only 30 less than the regular (390 vs. 420) but that includes the 60 cal sauce which comes on the side only for the grilled, so you can either not use it or use just a little to save. I haven't tried the grilled nuggets (130) as when the calorie count is *that* low, I don't know how full I'll be for that price point, but I've heard they're good. I'd probably stick to the sandwich or strips if getting non-grilled. The waffle fries are a guilty pleasure of mine, but still caloric like normal fries (420 for a medium). I haven't tried their salads but they look like good options. Just keep in mind that the dressing is a very large chunk of the calories. The southwest salad is 680 normally, but the dressing is 290, so if you only use half, you could bring that down to 535.
* **Raising Cane's/Popeyes/KFC/etc.:** Fried chicken in general is never going to be calorically cheap. But watch for the sides and sauce the most. At Cane's, the sauce is 190. You probably don't want to skip it altogether if you're going to Cane's in the first place (there's better chicken out there) but using only half of it saves you 100 calories. That takes a 3-finger combo from 1050 to 950 and a box combo from 1290 to 1190. If I get a box combo, I usually replace the slaw (100) with another toast (140), which is another guilty pleasure of mine. Places like Popeyes have mashed potatoes as a side option, which is 110 cals vs. 270 for fries. Can't speak to how good those taste though as I rarely eat there. Watch for ranch sauces, which are very fattening compared to ketchup.
* **Jack in the Box:** I love their artery-stopping burgers but man those things are not good for you lol. The bacon ultimate burger is 930. You can hold the mayo, I guess? I don't know how much that saves but based on other places, probably 50-100. Their chicken is good. The spicy chicken is 550 with mayo so probably 450-500 without. A lot of their sandwiches come with plenty of sauce so you need to pay attention to how much you're eating. Even if you leave the sauce on when you order, you can probably wipe a bit off with your napkin when you eat and save 30-50 calories just from that. Same principle with any sandwich-heavy restaurant (e.g. Whataburger), really.
* **Starbucks:** It's hard to tell how much exactly, but in general you can shave off a good amount of calories by subbing in sugar-free syrup and nonfat milk. By my estimating, that would take a grande hot caramel macchiato (my favorite order) from 250 cals to like 150. Pure coffee (Pike roast, Americano, etc.) is very low in calories, probably like 10 for a grande, but if you take it with cream don't neglect how many calories that can add. One tablespoon of heavy cream is probably 35-50 depending on what brand they use (I used to work at Starbucks too but have forgotten by now). Same idea with sugar, brown sugar, etc. so I just use Splenda in mine.

The principle is, you can still eat (most of) your favorite things from your favorite places, but making little substitutions here and there is going to add up in the long run. Some of the substitutions might seem like they hurt the flavor too much to be worth it, but just like with diet vs. sugary soda, the knowledge that I'm saving dozens or hundreds of calories is more than enough to compensate. To lose weight, you will have to make sacrifices. But skipping the mayo on your favorite sandwich is a much smaller sacrifice than skipping the sandwich altogether. 

I was inspired to do this post by rediscovering this book called Eat This Not That which my mom bought in like 2012. It has way more restaurants than this (including sit-down places) along with supermarket food swap options, and it goes into macros too if you're into that. But the version of the book we have has a bunch of items which don't exist anymore, and surely many chains have tweaked the recipes for the items that do. But it was still fun to look through. Maybe they have a more recent version? Just remember, we live in a time where pretty much every major chain has all their nutritional information available on their websites and you can access it in seconds from behind a screen before you even go to the restaurant.

1iwxbwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1iwxbwz/recurring_issue/,Recurring issue,"I 31 F have been with my boyfriend 34 M for 2 years. We have known each other for 16 years due to him being a close friend to my family. Since I’ve known him, he has dated maybe around 5 girls, 1 of them, a friend of mine for around 2 years but we’re not that close. During the time he was single, he would message me and ask me to go out but I have always declined, (even though I’m attracted to him) due to that friend. I know a lot of people wouldn’t even care, considering we’re not even close but for me, it’s a huge hurdle because I know what I’m like. 

I grew up in a very toxic environment with a lot of domestic abuse so I guess that made me scared of being in a relationship, so I’ve been single for the first 29 years of my life…. For me, being in a relationship seemed stressful and I guess I was kind of avoiding it too, I mean the only person that could hurt me is me really, plus I’ve been fine all these years. I just had to deal with all the “why don’t you have a boyfriend”, “are you a lesbian?” “I have someone that’s perfect for you!” Don’t get me wrong, there were a few guys that I did find attractive but I guess my standards were too high so I didn’t even bother (I realised that list of standards was absurd and was there to protect myself in a way). 

So I went out one night and something happened, he ended up helping me and got me home. From then on, the people around me kept telling me to give him a chance and after a few months of pestering, I gave in and asked him out for some coffee. The date went really well and we got to know each other properly, and I told him the reason why I never went there with him in the first place was because of his ex and how I didn’t want to deal with it but I guess I’ll let it go. So we started dating and I was genuinely happy. After a bit, I found out that he has hooked up with 2 of my friends (both from different friendship groups) and so I confronted him about it and he apologised, saying it meant nothing, during that time he thought he’ll never get a chance with me and he also gave up on the idea of settling down so that’s why he did what he did and he didn’t want to tell me at the start because he knew I wouldn’t want to be with him at all. Which is correct, if I knew all that then, I would not have asked him out for coffee. 


Fast forward to 2 years later, we’re still together but I’m still so insecure. I get it, it’s in the past but it still affects me. I found out the correct term for it is retrospective jealousy. I’ve tried listening to podcasts about it to try and better myself but it’s not really helping. He has always been a nice guy and treated everyone, girls especially really well, but that just makes me not feel special at all. He follows a lot of girls on insta and I told him I had an issue with it, especially since he’s flirted and taken them out for dinner prior to us dating and so he deleted all those girls. He also deleted all the chats and likes which made me extremely mad cause it seems like he’s hiding things but he said there’s no need to keep past chats if they mean nothing to him. Which I get too but I can’t help feel what I feel. Don’t get me wrong he treats me really well but we do have our small fights which we work through together and he also gets moody sometimes and doesn’t tell my why he’s upset because he doesn’t want to fight, so I just let him be, even though it does make me sad too. 

He use to be very active online doing twitch, discord etc, which is something I’m not familiar with and so knows and has A LOT of friends. So when I’m on social media, I’ll randomly see old posts of some of the girls he’s ’liked’(bikini photos etc), the things they say about him and, the nicknames they gave him and I’ll get triggered. I’ll question him about the girl and he’ll say they’re just friends and I do believe him but calling him “my precious (bfs name)”….It’s a bit much right? oh and he also goes out of his way to follow their pets accounts as well as their business accounts/side accounts… its just not something I would do, I have boundaries when it comes to my guy friends and I definitely would not do anything to ‘lead’ them on. 

I have really bad anxiety/social anxiety and a lot of health issues as well, so I like to keep my life simple, friendship circle small and only go out when it’s necessary. He’s helped me a lot during these past few months with all my issues but every few weeks/months, I’ll see these triggers and it’ll upset me, which is unfair for him because it’s his past. I don’t want to be like his exes and make our relationship toxic and we do love each other very much. I mean he is my first for everything but it’s just upsetting that I’m just one of many for him and I guess that’s why I’m so insecure. So now I’m at a point where I just don’t know what to do. It’s also not fair to break up with him for something that’s happened in the past, he’s been working hard trying to build a future for us but I also don’t want to burden him with insecurities.

My question is, what soaps, shampoos and body lotions are you using?  I read that cetaphil, so I switched to it and my whole body peeled and I itched all over for 2 days.  It also made the psoriasis that I’ve had for 12 years far worse.  Maybe I’m allergic?

I got gloves to help with my hands when I’m washing dishes.  But it’s been very frustrating because I can’t film videos of myself or go live until I get this and the dermatitis on my face fixed.  I tried to use filters, but that didn’t really hide anything and that makes me feel even more insecure.  I also tried EOS lotion and an eczema specific body butter with colloidal oatmeal in it from the dollar store but it hasn’t really helped anything.

I’m not big on meds.  But I’m allergic to chicken and beef so I already don’t eat those.  I am already limited on dairy and no eggs as a result of my allergies.

This is my story in short:

* I realised who I was after some time in Europe for my higher education years. Coming out wasn't easy, but I'm glad that I did.
* I moved back in 2018 and struggled with finding community here. Finding a job as a foreigner in the UK was really tough. Since then, I've been struggling from invisibility here and not really knowing how to do that balancing act of safety and being out enough to find people like me.
* At the moment, I'm out to my family but they are lukewarm about it and to a few friends who told me to stay low key for my job and safety. While people do not actively hunt for LGBTQIA+ to harm, some people may resort to more passive aggressive tactics, e.g. smear campaign, ostracism, quiet firing etc. It's still unpleasant and enough to make anyone anxious.
* We all take some time to find our people, it's an understandable trial and error. I feel like this is harder because of the mask I wear regarding my sexuality.
* I tried finding it by going online. The pandemic created a lot of online communities. I joined an online group and had Coffee Meets Bagel account in Singapore. It was hard to not be physically present and connect for the ones who I clicked with for a date and with friends. When you've never been in anything romantic before, it's hard to love long distance at level 1. I felt awkward and divided, like standing in a doorway with one foot on one end and the other at the other end.

With the way the global economy is, I doubt I would be able to move out of my home country. Even with the way things are, I want connect with others like myself

We both CO-OP and me and my crush are both in high school.  They are a senior and are leaving this year, and I think I will never forgive myself if I don't tell them I like them.

 It was September 18th, 2024 when they sat next to me on a couch during a club we were both starting. It's called Key Club, (You can look it up if you're interested) and we immediately started talking. I found out we were fairly similar. We both like the same artist, have read the same books, have the same beliefs. Unfortunately this club only meets twice a month and you only have to go to one meeting a month. So, I don't see them as often as I wish I would. I kept saying that if they were the one to let me see them again, and i'm not fucking joking the same day I walk into a coffee shop that I had been going to for ages, and they were working there! 

At first they showed no interest rest in me. It took them weeks to reply to messages, but when I saw them at Key Club they were as perfect as ever. As time has gone by though, i've started to hint at liking them and they have done to same back. We stare at each other during Key Club, we always sit next to each other (And I mean like thighs touching close), and they have gotten better at texting me back. I know so much about them. The other day they told me about this girl who was hitting on them by adding them to their close friends list of Instagram only after knowing them for a week or two, (Obviously that means they correlate someone doing that to having a crush) and I kid you not the next day they added me to their close friends list. Also, they reply to a lot of my stories on Instagram too. Their texts are a little dry though. Sometimes it can take them hours on end to respond, but other than that they are perfect. 

We are friends and i'm scared to screw up what we already have. Should I tell them? Do they like me back?",2,1740385032.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
