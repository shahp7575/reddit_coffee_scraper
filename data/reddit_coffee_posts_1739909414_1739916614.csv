We met in college & every hangout we've done ends with a dutch run, it has really become a staple of our friendship. She texted me about this drop that was happening and we both weren't sure what time to head over to our nearest dutch so we went around 4:30pm, these we're dropping at 5pm. We got in line and asked one of the very sweet broista how the drop was gonna work and he adviced us to come back around 4:55pm and get in line. We wait in this parking lot right across the dutch bros and I find a parking spot where I can directly see dutch & my friend and I are just chatting, killing time and from the corner of our eyes we see the broista jump up and down and motioning his hands for us to come over. I drive over & he tells us that it's the first one of the day that he's going to give out. We order 2 coffees & tipped that man $5 cause he really went above and beyond for us. He was such a nice guy and honestly we wouldve missed out on the drop if it wasnt for him because not even 10 minutes later there was a line out the door. We pulled up the the window and what I assumed was the boss, which I later asked him if he was, handed us our drinks & I hyped that broista up so much, gotta let the big man know that he has an amazing employee☺️ even joked around & said that the full $5 tip better go to him (i know the tips are split amongst all the workers)

Whether you're a globe-trotting traveler, a dedicated remote worker, an adventurous outdoor enthusiast, a diligent student, ⁤or simply preparing for unexpected emergencies, a reliable power bank is no longer a​ luxury – it's‌ a necessity.‍ The Apowking portable‌ power bank, with its range of capacities ​and features, aims to​ be that solution.

## Understanding Power Bank Capacity: More ‍Than Just ⁤a Number

Before diving into specific Apowking models, let's clarify ⁣what ""capacity"" actually⁢ means. Measured ​in milliampere-hours (mAh) or watt-hours (Wh), capacity indicates how much energy a power⁣ bank can store. A higher mAh or Wh rating means the power bank ‌can hold more charge and,consequently,recharge ​your devices more times. However, not all mAh values are created equal. Factors like voltage conversion efficiency ‌and the device being charged influence the actual number of ‍charges you'll get.

Think‌ of it like this: ⁢a 10,000 ⁣mAh power bank won't necessarily charge your 3,000 mAh phone ‌three-plus ⁢times. Some energy is inevitably ‌lost ​during the charging process. This article takes these factors into ⁣consideration ‍when helping you find the ideal **portable charger apowking capacity**.

1isohii,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1isohii/i_broke_up_with_my_fiance_a_week_before_the/,I broke up with my Fiance a week before the wedding and now his family will not leave me alone.,"I am in desperate need for advice and I cannot really talk to those in my family or my friends as they are very angry on my behalf and want me to scorch the earth and burn all the bridges. I met my now ex about 3 years ago. I was 22 and he was 27. We got along really well at first, and we stayed friends for a while. It wasn't until the very end of 2023 that we decided to go on a date. It was more of a joke date because we had a few friends that kept trying to push us together. However, being by myself with him that night really changed how I looked at him. We spent hours talking and laughing at dinner. I felt lik we connected on a different level. We spoke about what we each wanted for our future's and they almost completley alligned. We started going on several dates a week after that. Some just to coffee shops or walks in the park with our dogs, others to nice restaurants or movies etc. 

I say all this to show that the relationship was always easy, fun, and happy. We had very few disagreements, and those we did have were not about serious topics. It breaks my heart knowing that he was lying to me the whole time. We got engaged in May (I know it was fast, but it felt right), and planned our wedding for the last week of February. I am Mexican and he is Indian, so we planned a traditional Mexican wedding for the 23rd and then the rest of the week were going to be the big parties and ceremonies following his families traditions. Four days ago, on Valentine's morning, I was approached by my ex's cousin at my home. I was finishing packing when she knocked on my door. We sat on the floor (since all my furniture had been moved) with coffee and started talking. We had been very close since before I started dating my ex, and the engagement just brought us closer. After some small talk, she told me that she had something serious and difficult to discuss with me. She wanted me to listen to a voice recording my now ex and a family gathering of his. I was unable to attend due to work commitments. In this recording he was bragging about a case he had a few years ago. He sounded drunk and was telling whoever he was with to not say anything to me.

As I listened longer, he let details about this case slip, and it became apparent he was talking about a case that I was sued in. In 2020, I rear-ended a truck who slammed on their breaks while we coming up to a red light. I wasn't paying proper attention and hit the trucks back bumper. We were going less then 10 miles an hour when it happen, and the truck had one stratch above the license plate as a result. I called my insurance and reported the accident. Within an hour I was being told by my insurance that the driver of the truck had retained a lawyer and were claiming there were 5 people in the truck and all had serious injuries. They couple that were actually in truck didn't know that we had a lot of mutual friends who they bragged to. They bragged to those mutual friends that they were going to get all the mony that they could because I looked rich, and openly admitted to those friends all the lies they were claiming. Which included the amount of people in the car, all the injuries, and that their lawyer insisted on claiming injuries and emotional trauma from the accident. 

I was also told by these mutual friends that their laywer had given them my address and phone number, which then led to harrassing phone calls, messages, and people parking in front of my driveway and blocking my car in. There was much more, but then this post would longer than it already is. It was terrifying, and emotionally exhausting. It did not end until a few of those friends told me that they would volunteer to be witnesses in court if needed. I called my insurance and spoke with the investigator assigned to my case and let him know everything with my friends permission. Within a week the case was settled and they got a payout. My insurance rate almost doubled. They whole siutation from the accident to settlement lasted almost an entire year. It was exhausting, fustrating, and horrible. 

I now know that their laywer was my ex fiance. The lawfirm which handled the case was owned by my ex-fiance which he relocated and renamed before we met (almost immediatley after the case closed). According to the voice recording, he apparently knew who I was not long after we first met. Knowing that he pushed those people to harrass me, to lie, and try to get me to pay them on the side broke my heart. I asked his cousin how she got the recording, and she told me she was there and when she realized the situation he was talking about, she began recording on her phone. At that moment, I felt as though the floor was ripped out from under me. I even thought about forgiving him, until she showed me the messages bewtween my ex fiance and her. She confronted him about it the next day, and instead of feeling remorseful, he threatened her and said he would reveal her previous drinking problem to her husband. 

I gave up on the relationship in that moment. I couldn't believe what I was reading, but I confirmed it was his number, and the time was when he was with me on a lunch date. I recall he had been on his phone a lot throughout the date and was a little more irritable that day. I broke off the engagement the next day. I went to his house with my brother, cousins, dad and uncles to get all my stuff and move back to my house while I spoke with him. I wanted to know why he did what he did years ago, and why he would let it our relationship get this far. I didn't get any meaningful answers. He just kept repeating himself and saying that he loves me, he didn't think it was a big deal, and I should be able to forgive him. I gave him his ring back, and told him no, It was over. I called his parents immediatley after I left and told them what happened and why. I explained that nothing they could say would allow me to trust their son again. They were quiet on the phone, and didn't say much. I went home and cried. My sister and mother handled canceling what they could of the things I paid for. 

All was quiet until yesterday, his whole family has been calling me, messaging me, emailing me, and showing up at my house to try to convince me to get back with him. I keep being told that I was too hasty in my decision, but I don't believe I was. I spent an entire 24 hours trying to convince myself I can move on and stay with him before I called my dad and asked him to help me move my stuff. However, the onslaught of messages, phonecalls, and now visits have been a lot to handle. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm exhausted, over-whelmed, and feel like crying every 5 minutes. Maybe I have made a hasty decision, but I can't see myself trusting him again, and I can't see him as the same man with the good morals I fell in love with.

I'm a beginner freediver, started a couple months ago and I'm basically attending training once per week. My DYNB PB is 75m, and today I swam a DNF PB of 62m. After I finished and started my recovery breathing, I started to feel pressure / pain in the back of my neck, or rather in the back of my skull, above my neck. This feeling started getting stronger, like a mixture of pressure and sore / straining muscles, burning feeling? It's hard to describe. Even my swimming cap was irritating and I had to remove it. Massaging the area seemed to alleviate / help. This lasted for about 3-5 minutes and then slowly dissipated. Never had this feeling during a dive before. The feeling slightly came back towards the end of the training (just a dull pressure, not really pain) and I decided to call it a day for breath hold exercises at that moment. I'm wondering if this could be a blood pressure related thing as I am quite over-coffeinated today (5 coffees and about 1l of black tea, lots of work had to be done).

It provides with a text format of endpoints as well as a full packet capture per process. About 5 months ago i published the initial release and since then, i've implemented: 

- functionality of monitoring every TCPIP and DNS activity of every process running on the system at the same time
- DNS responses to processes (resolved IP adresses of domains) are generated as DFL filters (Wireshark filters). In other words, if you have a pcap file with lots of different traffic, and you only want to see traffic going to suswebsite\[.\]io, you can simply copy the generated filter into wireshark.
- A timer for running a monitoring session for a specific set of seconds
- Executing WhoYouCalling as another user
- And ofcourse lots of optimizations...

**Version 1.5** includes visualizating the process network traffic with an interactive map as well as automatic API lookups to identify malicious IPs and domains. The API lookup is completely optional, and i've made the instrucitons very simple and clear on how to use WhoYouCalling and the visualization method. If anything is unclear or doesn't quite work, you're more than welcome to create an issue!

I've done a short FAQ summary that may help in understanding WYC.  
**Who is WhoYouCalling for?** 
- Sysadmins (For understanding which traffic a host or process requires to function)
- Blueteamers (Incident response, malware analysis) 
- Security researchers (Understanding what an application is doing to identify vulnerabilities)
- Game hackers (Understanding game traffic for possible packet manipulation) 
- Red teamers (Payload creators for testing detection)
- Paranoid people (Like me, that just wants to understand who the heck my Windows machine is calling)

**What do i need to run WhoYouCalling?**
- a Windows machine
- Admin access to a terminal (For being able to listen to ETW and if you want full packet capture)
- Python 3.11 (If you want to visualize the output from WhoYouCalling)

**How does it work?**
- It uses the [Windows ETW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-) listening to TCPIP and DNS activity made by processes. It also starts a full packet capture before monitoring which is later subjected to a generated BPF-filter based on the ETW recorded TCPIP activity, ensuring an as close as possible packet capture file to the processes. When the monitoring is done, if the session is closed with CTRL+C or the timer ran out, the results is placed in a filder to a specified directory to the working directory. 

**Do i need to pay for a license?** 
- No, and you never will. But you can buy me a coffee if you want

**What about licenses for including WhoYouCalling in my own malware analysis sandbox?**
- WYC is under the MIT-license and i've made sure that all other dependencies i've included is also under open licenses such as MIT.

This is the punch card that gives you 15 punches, each coffee drink costing one or two punches depending on size.

First question is do I 'need' it? I'm by no means a coffee snob, but I don't like most of the coffee served in restaurants - it tends to be watery and not taste good. I make good coffee at home with a $15 French press and good-quality supermarket coffee, i.e. Green Mountain or similar, and I enjoy it.

I'm not expecting the coffee in the MDR or elsewhere to be that good. Is that accurate, or will I be pleasantly surprised?

Also, I don't take sugar with my coffee but do enjoy cream or half-and-half. How do they serve milk/cream for the coffee? - in those little paper cupfuls of half-and-half, in a metal or ceramic creamer, or (God forbid) in non-dairy packets or little paper cups?

Where, outside the MDR and Windjammer, can you find the 'free' coffee?

I have the same question about where I can use the punch-hole Cafe Select Card. Can I use it in the MDR or Windjammer? It looks like it can be used in the Park Cafe. What about Latitudes (and while we're talking about it, it looks like you need to purchase coffee, of whatever type, in Latitudes. Are the pastries included in the cruise price or do they cost extra?

Do they have the free coffee, or can I use the Cafe Select card, in any of the other bars? I've looked at the menu and haven't seen any 'traditional' coffee drinks, but I'm sure there are things they do that aren't on the menu.

Any advice or assistance would be truly appreciated!

I’m not sure where this train of thought started, but I’m just…conflicted. I know she’s an adult and I’m ultimately not responsible for her or anything, I just love her and I…kinda want her to grow up.

We were discussing Harry Potter (LOL) and I was ranting about how much l love the series but I hate the author’s bigotry. My sister is lowkey transphobic (She spends a lot of time on twitter and there were a few viral commentaries about how some trans women think they are better and more valid than ciswomen and it’s permanently altered her stance on this population).

I’m very much against her belief, it’s like a feminist opinion that’s gone wayside, and I’ve never heard any of my trans friends personally alude to this. Twitter is a cesspit anyway, full of loud and wrong people from all walks of life.

Anywho, that’s the biggest thing we disagree on. She’s otherwise extremely feminist, anti-racist, anti-religion, etc.

So, it made me have a conversation with my husband about how my sister is chronically online and is a little nihilistic to cope with—what I believe—is an extreme fear of the world.

She hates men; has never dated. Not even a coffee date. Years ago my dad watched a guy say hi to her, and she literally glared at him until he walked away.

She has never had a job outside of working for my mother, who will be returning to the corporate world and is no longer self employed. So, she won’t be able to pay my sister.

She can’t drive, and refuses to take public transportation. Not even Uber or Lyft. Thus, she doesn’t want to work outside of the home. (We all know remote work is hard to find especially without a degree or a job that involved talking to people.)

I know these sound like separate problems but stay with me.

My dad passed away. She lives with my mom and my mom is getting older. She has so much introspection and claims to know a hell of a lot about life but is over 30 and has never experienced life. She’s very smart; I love having deep conversations with my sister. But a lot of ends with “well nothing matters and nobody cares anyway, the world is gonna end with global warming or who ever so…”

I’m basically wondering if our relationship will crumble after my mom passes because if she remains like this, she will ultimately rely on me. All of her believe are cripplig her ability to get herself out there, and she believes it’s all 100% justified and self-preservation. I think it’s all a coping mechanism and if I even brought it up it would be a hellish conversation. We’ve discussed her becoming more independent before and she blew up on me and we didn’t speak for two weeks. We’ve never gone more than a day without calling or texting each other. We have no other family where we live, if you’re wondering.


TDLR: My sister is a grown adult who is chronically online and refuses to experience life and challenge her perspectives, and I’m worried she won’t change until she absolutely has to and I will be directly affected by it.

ADD: I’m married with children, I work full time and I also help my husband care for his sick parents. So I’m just wanting her to actually experience life instead of forming every opinion based on watching other people online, and whatever she hears from me and a few other friends.",3,1739914134.0,AskWomenOver30,12,1.0,False

**Version 1.5** includes visualizating the process network traffic with an interactive map as well as automatic API lookups to identify malicious IPs and domains. The API lookup is completely optional, and i've made the instrucitons very simple and clear on how to use WhoYouCalling and the visualization method. If anything is unclear or doesn't quite work, you're more than welcome to create an issue!

I've done a short FAQ summary that may help in understanding WYC.  
**Who is WhoYouCalling for?** 
- Game hackers (Understanding game traffic for possible packet manipulation) 
- Red teamers (Payload creators for testing detection)
- Blueteamers (Incident response, malware analysis) 
- Security researchers (Understanding what an application is doing to identify vulnerabilities)
- Sysadmins (For understanding which traffic a host or process requires to function)
- Paranoid people (Like me, that just wants to understand who the heck my Windows machine is calling)

**What do i need to run WhoYouCalling?**
- a Windows machine
- Admin access to a terminal (For being able to listen to ETW and if you want full packet capture)
- Python 3.11 (If you want to visualize the output from WhoYouCalling)

**How does it work?**
- It uses the [Windows ETW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-) listening to TCPIP and DNS activity made by processes. It also starts a full packet capture before monitoring which is later subjected to a generated BPF-filter based on the ETW recorded TCPIP activity, ensuring an as close as possible packet capture file to the processes. When the monitoring is done, if the session is closed with CTRL+C or the timer ran out, the results is placed in a filder to a specified directory to the working directory. 

**Do i need to pay for a license?** 
- No, and you never will. But you can buy me a coffee if you want

**What about licenses for including WhoYouCalling in my own malware analysis sandbox?**
- WYC is under the MIT-license and i've made sure that all other dependencies i've included is also under open licenses such as MIT.

Has anyone had good experiences with selling coffee beans? I’m currently running ads for a client who sells coffee beans with an average order value of around €30. I’ve mostly worked with niche products with higher order values (€70-100), and my usual strategy worked well there: test different target groups against each other, then test various ads manually, and consistently scale the winners.

With this coffee project, however, I’ve tested several target groups and always get similar results – no clear winners. I even split them further by gender and age and ran tests again. Still no success. Broad campaigns were also a nightmare. We’re stuck at around €50 per sale, even though CTR is decent and link clicks cost €0.50-0.70.

Now I’m considering switching to an Advantage+ Shopping campaign and increasing the budget to €150/day to give it a fair shot for a month (50€/Sale, so 3 Sales a day hopefully and 90 Conversions in a month for finding the best customers). 

The website is optimized, loads fast, has high-quality images and videos, and customers are sent directly to the coffee or the sample package.

I’m genuinely stumped and would love to hear if anyone has faced similar challenges or has some ideas to try. Thanks in advance!

EDIT:
Best Target was:
Only Story and Reels (Interest coffee beans, coffee machine 25-65)
Budget: 935€

CPM: 11,61€
CTR: 4,5

I read their explanation and honestly, I am more confused than at the beginning. They talk about how it creates a living wage where they pay all of their workers very well and they pull all of the money and distribute it. I asked the bartender is this the tip? He said it is but you can leave additional.

I don’t feel I should have to leave any additional money, especially considering they’re charging 22% for a cup of coffee, 22% for a to go order that I picked up and the like. But I still kind of feel like a jerk filling in zero.

As we approach 2025, mastering the latest SEO strategies is essential to ensure your content ranks high, attracts the right audience, and drives meaningful engagement. Are you ready to future-proof your content and dominate search engine results? This guide will walk you through the top 10 SEO strategies for 2025, empowering you to create content that not only resonates with your audience but also excels in search rankings.

## 1. Embrace AI-Driven SEO

AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it's an integral part of modern SEO. According to Semrush, AI-driven SEO is essential for adapting to algorithm changes and optimizing content. How can content creators leverage AI to enhance their SEO efforts? Start by using AI tools to identify content gaps, optimize existing content, and even generate SEO-optimized blog posts. Platforms like idestuner.com harness cutting-edge AI to streamline content creation—empowering creators, marketers, and businesses to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized content quickly and cost-effectively. Ethical AI practices are paramount, ensuring content originality and avoiding plagiarism.

## 2. Optimize for Voice Search

Voice search is transforming how users interact with search engines. Neil Patel predicts a significant shift towards voice search optimization. How do you optimize your content for voice search in 2025? Focus on natural language and conversational keywords. Craft content that answers common questions directly and concisely. For example, instead of ""best coffee makers,"" use ""what is the best coffee maker for home use?"" This approach aligns with how people speak, making your content more discoverable through voice search.

## 3. Prioritize User Experience (UX)

User experience remains a critical ranking factor. Forbes Advisor emphasizes the importance of user experience and engagement. How can you improve UX to boost your SEO? Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, loads quickly, and offers a seamless browsing experience. High-quality content that satisfies user intent is also crucial. Focus on creating content that is informative, engaging, and easy to navigate.

## 4. Focus on E-E-A-T

Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) are more important than ever. Lily Ray highlights the need for E-E-A-T in SEO. How do you demonstrate E-E-A-T in your content? Showcase your expertise through well-researched, accurate, and detailed content. Build authority by earning backlinks from reputable sources and establishing yourself as a thought leader in your niche. Ensure your website is secure and transparent to build trust with your audience.

## 5. Leverage Video SEO

Video content is increasingly favored by search engines. Forbes Advisor notes that video content is gaining prominence in search rankings. What are the best practices for video SEO in 2025? Optimize your YouTube videos with relevant keywords, compelling titles, and detailed descriptions. Use transcripts to make your video content more accessible and search-engine friendly. AI-driven video editing and optimization tools can also help streamline the process.

## 6. Master Mobile-First Indexing

Mobile-first indexing has been a key focus for several years, and its importance will only grow. How important is mobile-first indexing in 2025? Extremely important. Ensure your website is fully optimized for mobile devices. This includes having a responsive design, fast loading times, and a user-friendly mobile interface. Neglecting mobile optimization can significantly harm your search rankings.

## 7. Build High-Quality Backlinks

Backlinks remain a crucial ranking factor. What are some effective link-building strategies for 2025? Focus on earning backlinks from authoritative and relevant websites. Guest blogging, creating valuable resources, and participating in industry discussions can help you build a strong backlink profile. Avoid black-hat tactics like buying links, as they can lead to penalties.

## 8. Implement Structured Data and Schema Markup

Structured data and schema markup enhance search engine understanding of your content. Search Engine Journal highlights the importance of structured data. How do you implement schema markup effectively? Use schema markup to provide search engines with detailed information about your content, such as articles, events, and products. This can improve your chances of appearing in rich snippets and enhancing your visibility in search results.

## 9. Stay Updated with Algorithm Changes

Search engine algorithms are constantly evolving. How do you stay up-to-date with algorithm changes? Follow industry blogs, attend webinars, and participate in SEO communities to stay informed about the latest updates. Adapt your SEO strategies accordingly to maintain your rankings. Tools like idestuner.com can help you monitor algorithm changes and adjust your content strategy in real-time.

## 10. Focus on Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords can drive targeted traffic to your website. What are the benefits of focusing on long-tail keywords? Long-tail keywords are specific, less competitive, and often reflect user intent more accurately. Incorporate long-tail keywords into your content to attract users who are searching for specific information. This can improve your conversion rates and overall SEO performance.

### What are the key SEO trends to watch out for in 2025?

Several key SEO trends are emerging as we approach 2025. These include the increasing importance of AI-driven SEO, the rise of voice search, the continued focus on user experience, and the need for E-E-A-T. Staying informed about these trends and adapting your strategies accordingly is crucial for success.

### How will AI impact SEO in the next few years?

AI will continue to transform SEO in numerous ways. AI-powered tools can help with content creation, optimization, and analysis. AI algorithms will also play a greater role in search engine rankings, making it essential to adapt to AI-driven SEO practices.

### What are the best SEO tools for content creators?

Please help me with your wisdom, plant elders!","Hey Guys, I have this single money tree trunk living from a money tree I got from Lowe’s in June (the big, hefty ones with trunks maybe two or three inches in diameter each at the base, if that matters). Can I repot it in a two-ish foot tall glass vase that I drilled holes in for drainage if I have the right soil combination (and one of those plastic things that go at the bottom of pots to fight against rot)? It’s tall and narrower than my other pots. I’ve had trouble with other pots being too wide in diameter and have gotten root rot more than one time having had to separate the living trunks after overwatering, and the trunk wants to fall in shallower pots. The root ball of this trunk has grown at a sideways angle, making it hard to figure out how to support it without one side of the trunk squishing up against the side of the pot, which can't be good for the little roots growing on that side. I had my living trunk (maybe 4 feet tall) in a (outside-glazed?) terracotta pot about five inches in diameter and a foot tall to avoid root rot, then its new baby growth started to yellow and fall off and not grow at the very fast rate my newer, similarly large (but fully intact and braided) money tree is growing. I was thinking maybe I was choking it with a lack of room to for the roots to spread, but didn't plan to repot it. I was checking for root rot one day and accidentally dislodged it pretty much all the way. I thought if I basically had to repot it, I might as well try to fix the problem of it being space-hampered. 

My plant-nursery-friend suggested using lots of peat moss if I want to use glass. I have some peat moss, a brick of coconut coir I just hydrated, and the Lowe's brands of seed starter mix, citrus/palm/cactus mix, orchid mix, and vermiculite and perlite at my disposal. I don't plan use all of that, unless y'all think some sort of combo actually would be useful. I don't have any decomposed granite, like I have seen some recipes call for. It's been out of the pot nearly a week now with a moistened coffee filter around its roots, so I'm afraid the clock's ticking for getting it planted. I'd really like to use this tall glass pot with a drainage cone thing at the bottom, but I need soil combo help and maybe the hard truth as to whether it will live in glass. (Indoors.) I really need this last trunk to live. Thank you for any help. If I need to take direct pot measurements I will gladly do so. 

I appreciate you all. :)))))",2,1739913787.0,pachira,1,1.0,False

Yesterday she decided not to move forward with it because she still didn’t trust me and was still upset about how we broke up. I was actually kind of glad because I knew that my therapist would be pissed and I agreed that it was not good for my mental health, but I have also been deprived of touch so that was mainly why I was okay with going over to her house and cuddling. 

we had a pretty big conversation about why my actions led to our break up and the whole situation. She seemed like she understood my side. 

 it seems like even though she mentioned that she doesn’t trust me anymore, didn't feel comfortable with me being in her bed and doesn’t wanna revisit that part of our relationship anymore she said that she still wants to be friends. 

which I’m glad because the last couple times I’ve seen her downtown she used to literally either bolt out the door or look at me pissed so if we can at least be cordial with each other that would make my life so much better. 

Would it be weird if I contacted her and asked her to get coffee sometime or am I just doing too much? 

We haven’t talked at all in two months and then now in the past two days, we’ve been texting each other more frequently. 

I don’t wanna date her again and she actually mentioned that I ruined our future chances by what I did but I don’t see myself dating her because she’s not the woman I’m looking for, but I still wanna have her in my life and I still want to be friends am I stupid? 

My current plan is just to let things be and maybe text her in a couple days and see if she wants to get coffee, but not trying to reinsert me in her life, I want things to be more natural and more chill. My life has been fine without her for the last two months so I don’t see why I need to jump in with both feet in now.

1isnzbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/simpleliving/comments/1isnzbn/dear_espresso_machine_its_over/,"Dear espresso machine, it's over","A few years ago, I was gifted a nice espresso machine. Nothing too fancy, somewhere in the €150-200 range. It was meant to free me from the tyranny of capsules, those convenient little pods that my friend loathed with a fiery passion. “You *HAVE* to learn how to make proper espresso,” he insisted. “You’ll never look back.” Well, here I am, a few years later, looking back, because I’m officially done.  
  
Making espresso, I naively thought, would be a straightforward affair. Grind some coffee, press a button, and voilà: a perfect cup of rich, aromatic goodness. Spoiler alert: it’s not that simple. It’s an obstacle course of coffee-induced frustration, and the reward at the end? Maybe a decent shot of espresso. If you’re lucky.  
First, you’re faced with an overwhelming choice of roasts and cultivars. Some claim to taste wildly different, but honestly, most taste… fine. Not revolutionary, not life-changing, just fine. Then there’s the grind size, which has to be just right. Too coarse, and your coffee is weak. Too fine, and your machine might go into overdrive and refuse to brew anything at all. And then comes the preparation process, which requires the precision of a neurosurgeon. You can’t just scoop coffee into the portafilter and hope for the best. No, you have to measure it out *exactly* the right amount and tamp it down perfectly. Not too loose, not too tight. It has to be flat, but if you flatten it too much, the water won’t flow properly. Oh, and if the coffee doesn’t come out and your machine starts huffing and puffing? Guess what? That’s your fault too.  
Then there's the maintenance. The sheer maintenance required for this endeavor is enough to drive anyone to tears. Did you clean the filter? *Are you sure*? Because you need to check, *every  damn  time*. You have to wash it, dry it, and hold it up to the light to see if any microscopic pores are clogged. And if they are? Grab a needle and start poking. But don't poke *too* hard or you'll mess up your filter and then it will be trashed. But wait, there’s more! You also need to run water through the machine without the filter to flush out any rogue coffee grounds stuck in the system. And sometimes, the upper mesh won’t come off easily, so you’ll be fiddling with it while the machine sputters and sprays coffee grounds all over your counter. It’s a never-ending cycle of clean, brew, clean again. Want another cup of coffee? Great! Time to repeat the entire process. First, remove the used coffee grounds by either banging the portafilter against the counter (messy) or rinsing it under the tap (also messy). Congratulations, your kitchen is now coated in coffee debris. Better grab that towel you’ve wisely kept nearby because espresso machines are like toddlers: perpetually messy and completely unpredictable.  
  
Over time, I did manage to make some half-decent espresso. But the consistency? Nonexistent. The result is so dependent on a million tiny variables that I can seldom replicate the same coffee twice. Making good espresso is clearly an art. The thing is, I’m not an artist, and I don’t want to become one. I don’t care about optimizing water pressure, nailing the perfect temperature, or extracting the high and low notes from my grounds. I don’t need my coffee to be a masterpiece. I just want a cup of coffee. Simple, reliable, and mess-free. So, I’m calling it quits. Capsule coffee, drip coffee, whatever, at this point, they all sound like paradise. No more overthinking. No more maintenance marathons. No more coffee-covered countertops. To those who swear by the craft of the espresso: I salute you. But as for me, I’m out. Life’s too short to spend it cleaning filters and chasing the elusive perfect shot. I’ll take my coffee without the drama please.",13,1739913447.0,simpleliving,13,0.81,False

Compound is a journey.,"Background:  I started this journey of compounded Tirzepatide discovery in August of 2024.  Those first steps included a phone consult with my Functional MD, her asking if I would be interested in microdosing Tirzepatide, suggesting that I listen to some podcasts and read some of the research. 
 I started on 0.6 mg in September 2024 and felt immediate benefits. At that time, SW 196, F62, 5’10”, insulin resistant, post-menopausal 2 yrs, and no amount of dieting and exercise was changing any of those stats.  And I would not have qualified for brand name. Along comes October and the first FDA announcement about lifting the authorization to produce compounded meds —- aka, compounding is over.  I made a quick and expensive decision to buy 2 additional vials from the local compounding pharmacy. After that, I joined this sub and started looking at longer-term, less expensive options, and taking more control of where I was going with all of this. 

I placed an order with LSH in November and had a good experience with South Lake, but had to start at the initial 2.5 dose and by this time I was already at 3.0 mg…so not ideal. I also ordered wellness meds and there was a lot of chaos when I ordered the next level of Tirzepatide…they placed the order with Strive even though I re-ordered South Lake, sent another order of Glutathione (from Hallandale) instead of Tirzepatide😳. 

Based on pricing and the chaos, I placed an order with Brello in January to hedge against the FDA projected dates for stopping in February/March.  I had a very good experience with Brello and with Southend’s delivery.  I haven’t used any of the meds yet, although it is now next up for me to use due to the short BUDs. I also placed an order with Fifty410 to have some future meds with a longer BUD.  They were so easy to work with, fast response, excellent packaging and delivery from Hallandale.  Truly the best experience. 

So that was the condensed version of the process I followed and brings me to where I am today.  

Here’s my thought process…(CW: 176, still F62 5’10”.  GW: 160). After reading the tea leaves for the last few months about the current —> future state of compounding, I decided my path forward for the next year is to have a 1-year supply of reliably compounded tirz on-hand.  I realized that all of the shifting dates and uncertainty was making me both anxious and obsessive as I tried to figure out the best, most optimal, perfect plan ever.  As the February 19th date started getting closer, and the answers weren’t getting any clearer, I shifted to “what do I know now? And what steps can I take now that would make me feel relaxed and confident going forward?”.  

1.  Going with what I know:  
   A.  2/19 is the date I know for 503a’s
   B.  Hallandale is a source that I know and trust and meets my 1-year BUD needs 
   C.  Fifty410 has given me the simplest patient interface, the fastest response and fast, flawless delivery.  I placed a reorder with Fifty410 on Saturday (2/15) night through their portal,  They approved the order that night. I paid the invoice on Sunday morning (2/16) and received my order (perfectly packaged and shipped FedEx overnight) Tuesday morning (2/18) before 8am.  🥰

2.  Letting go of what I don’t know:
   A.  The future state and dates of compounding…I hope there is some path forward for long-term availability for patients to choose their own adventure…for me that means microdosing for the off-label benefits of clearing out inflammation and brain fog along with the weight loss. 
   B.  The need to figure out the alternative markets 🐭 right now…that approach feels rushed and coming at it for the wrong reasons for me right now which causes me to feel stressed and reluctant every time I start down that path. I’m fascinated and interested, but also trying to manage lots of other decisions.  
   C.  What else is coming that might replace what I’m taking today?  My current thinking is shaped by what I know, which is likely to expand. Retatrtide? Orforflipron?
   D. Cancelling with Brello today.  I don’t foresee being able to use it or need it within the next year (through 3/1/2026) at this point.

Injury happened playing lacrosse after a very active 7 day span. I look back and should’ve given myself more time to recover but alas, it is what it is. 

35M, love yoga, snowboarding,
mountain biking and pretty much any activity. I’ve had 3 microdisectomies, PCL tear, AC joint reconstruction, broken jaw and 2 heart ablations…so not my first rodeo! Each injury is a mental exercise first and foremost imo. 

Had mid substance speedbridge followed by 2 weeks in cast and then transitioned to Vacoped. 

Relocated outside of San Francisco for first 3 weeks…the calm environment and removal of city stimuli was a boon for healing. I spent most of my time resting, cooking, playing board games, ready, chatting on phone, listening to the Grateful Dead and Reiki healing music along with more television than usual. 

I went into vacoped 16 days post op and was FWB about a week after that. It took some time for me to understand that the boot is super protective and since then stairs and dog walking have been part of my daily routine. 

I’m icing 4-5x daily, elevating when off my feet and ditched the iWalk and crutches. Most cumbersome part of the day is showering, but the stool helps immensely. 

The incision areas at times give me feedback and feeling, at which point I’ll take that as a signal to rest, ice, elevate. The input of the anchors in sides of my heel are noticeable at times albeit not overly annoying. 

Eating healthy (soups, meat, bone broth, kachava smoothies, green tea, steel cut oatmeal w toppings, salads, fish w a few bread and heavier carb meals) along with coffee daily. I reduced alcohol intake. 

I sell real estate and have taken a pause to reduce outside stressors during this early healing cycle. Using Whoop to track my sleep, goal to get at least 4 hours of restorative sleep nightly. 

Start PT week 6, in meantime have been doing core and modified yoga at home along with active ROM (plantar flexion to no more than neutral). Wish I had access to a pool. Hope to set up my mtbike for inside stationary use once ortho/PT give green light. 

Definitely some tough days but overall all is well. Set little goals that are achievable and the bigger ones will fall into place.

Would love to hear what Reddit thinks about this. Would you ever talk to an AI therapist? Is this the future or just another dystopian Black Mirror episode waiting to happen?

Stopped drinking it when I started titration and I avoid all caffeine on the medication. Occasionally, I run out and have to resort to coffee again, but I've come to realise that I hate it.

Caffeine feels like chugging vodka from a plastic jug. I find it simultaneously too strong in terms of the physical reaction and too weak in terms of a corrective effect on the mind. I feel like coffee is more stimulating than the medication but in all the wrong ways. It only helps to get out of bed or when you desperately need to function and it's the only option, but otherwise it's an annoying racing heart and feels like spinning your wheels on empty while your brain still doesn't work.

I’ve gone down many online rabbit holes, subreddits, etc trying to figure out what it could be, but today was the first time I came across r/costochondritis, and I cautiously feel like I may have finally found the culprit. I have a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist next week, but in the meantime, I was wondering if anyone who has been diagnosed could describe whether my symptoms match a typical costo case? I have read through a bunch of posts but can’t fully figure out if what I have matches.

My pain is mainly localized to the crook of my left collarbone—it feels like the pain is under my skin in the gap between my collarbone and neck muscles. Sometimes it radiates a little higher into the neck muscles on the front and side. Most of the time, I feel no pain, but at intermittent and unpredictable moments I get an intense, low, ache that feels blunt and diffuse in its tone, but sharp in its area and medium in level of pain—it grabs my attention (and often, immediately activates my anxiety brain, fight or flight, I’m dying sort of feeling) then goes away a few seconds later. Sometimes a single burst will fluctuate in and out for about a minute, but it’s never sharp for more than 5 or so seconds. Sometimes this will happen ten times in an hour, sometimes it will go hours without happening.

I can’t figure out any specific rhyme or reason to what triggers it. Things that may seem to trigger it (but I can never 1:1 confirm any of these)—coffee, lying down, changing between lying down and standing, holding my arms up for long periods when i.e. doing the dishes, having trapped gas and needing to burp. The only thing I can say for sure triggered it was being hungover from alcohol—I first noticed it during a period I was drinking a lot, and stopped drinking because of this. The pain became less frequent/noticeable but it hasn’t gone away. I’m still new to costo so trying to figure out if what I’ve described seems typical, would be extremely grateful for any input, thanks!",2,1739912528.0,costochondritis,0,1.0,False

Budget-Friendly Upgrades to Enhance Your Kitchen Space
------------------------------------------------------

Revamping your kitchen can be an exciting project that doesn't have to break the bank. With a focus on budget-friendly upgrades, you can elevate your kitchen space while keeping your finances in check. Consider these effective ideas to refresh your kitchen without spending a fortune.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-improvement-items-kitchen  
  
### Refreshing Your Cabinets

One of the most impactful changes you can make is to your kitchen cabinets. Instead of a costly replacement, consider:

- **Painting:** A fresh coat of paint can do wonders. Opt for light colors to brighten the space or bold hues for a modern touch.
- **New Hardware:** Swapping out old knobs and pulls for stylish new ones can provide a fresh look. Choose finishes like matte black or brushed nickel for a trendy appeal.
- **Cabinet Refacing:** If your cabinets are in decent shape, refacing them can be a cost-effective option. It involves replacing the cabinet doors and covering the frames with veneer.

### Improving Lighting

Good lighting is key to a functional kitchen. Try these affordable lighting improvements:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-improvement-items-kitchen  
  
- **Install Under-Cabinet Lighting:** Add LED strip lights beneath cabinets to illuminate your countertops, making meal prep easier.
- **Replace Light Fixtures:** Upgrade outdated light fixtures with modern styles. Consider pendant lights over the island or a chic chandelier for a statement piece.
- **Utilize Natural Light:** Keep your windows clean and unobstructed. Use sheer curtains to let light in while maintaining privacy.

### Updating Countertops

Countertops can be quite an investment, but there are budget-friendly alternatives:

- **Laminate Solutions:** Modern laminate counters can mimic the look of wood or stone at a fraction of the cost.
- **Painted Countertops:** Yes, you can paint your countertops! Use a countertop-specific paint for a durable finish.
- **Tile Makeover:** If you’re up for it, consider laying tile over existing countertops for a unique design.

### Adding Storage Solutions

To maximize space in your kitchen, clever storage options are essential. Here are some wallet-friendly ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-improvement-items-kitchen  
  
- **Open Shelving:** Replace some upper cabinets with open shelves. It not only creates an airy feel but also showcases your best dishware.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Install magnetic strips to hold knives and metal utensils. This not only saves space but also adds a modern touch.
- **Rolling Carts:** Use a stylish rolling cart for extra storage. It can be stationed where needed or moved out of the way when not in use.

### Accessorizing Your Kitchen

Sometimes, it’s the little things that can make a big impact. Change your kitchen’s atmosphere with these accessory upgrades:

- **Fresh Paint or Wallpaper:** If painting cabinets isn’t in your budget, consider giving one wall a fun pop of color or patterned wallpaper.
- **New Rugs:** A cozy rug can bring warmth and comfort to your kitchen. Look for easy-to-clean options that can withstand spills.
- **Decorative Accents:** Incorporate decorative items like art prints, potted herbs, or stylish canisters to personalize the space.

### Smart Appliance Choices

If replacing old appliances, opt for energy-efficient models that save you money on your utility bills. Look for deals on last season's models, which often have a similar performance to their newer counterparts but come at a lower price. Additionally, consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-improvement-items-kitchen  
  
- **Small Appliances:** Upgrade small appliances like your toaster or coffee maker to match your kitchen's aesthetic.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Sometimes, simply reorganizing appliances can improve functionality without any additional cost—think about how you can make your layout more efficient.

With a bit of creativity and resourcefulness, you can transform your kitchen space into a stylish and functional area that you love to spend time in. Consider these budget-friendly upgrades, and enjoy your refreshed kitchen!

Food Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that applies engineering, natural sciences, and life sciences to the production, processing, preservation, and distribution of food. Food engineers are individuals who holds a BSc degree in Food Engineering (duh!) and are people who can ensure food safety, quality, and sustainability while developing innovative technologies for the food industry.

Key aspects of Food Engineering: 

* Food Safety & Quality Control: Ensuring that food products meet health and safety standards. 
* Food Processing & Preservation: Developing methods to extend shelf life and maintain nutritional value. 
* Biotechnology & Innovation: Applying modern technologies to improve food production. 
* Sustainability & Efficiency: Designing economic and environmentally friendly food production systems. 
* Scientific Research: Conducting studies that contribute to the industry and public health.

Whether you’re curious about the meaning behind the codes listed on food additives, wondering how nutritional values are calculated, fascinated by the process of Nutella production, or eager to know how sugar cane transforms into the syrup that sweetens your favorite breakfast cereal, or even interested in the chemical reactions that turn a simple cut of meat into the most flavorful steak - feel free to reach out and ask.

1isnivc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1isnivc/trying_to_recenter_after_nitpicking_testing/,"trying to re-center after nitpicking ""testing"" passive-aggressive comments","my uBPD is always making little comments on how I do the slightest things around the house. it's aggravating, but even though (logically) I know they're framing it in a passive-aggressive way to pretend like they're ""jUst hELping,"" I am expending a LOT of energy today trying to settle this in my body and in my mind, and I'd like some feedback from the community if you've been through this, or have any helpful encouragement or positive thoughts.

I am at a point where during the interaction, I essentially gray rock their commentary. I dont spiral in a shame attack afterwards (progress!). I do my best to ""do the thing"" anyway and get my needs met and refocus on my interests, instead of reworking my whole day around their petulant mood (years past). But, my PTSD brain does race to figure out what causes their remarks like today. I am okay with this, for now at least I am identifying patterns like what triggers them (recently, anniversary with nparent, so hopefully it blows over in a few days as per usual).

I found myself with a tense jaw at my desk. It angers me that my uBPD makes a stupid little comment at me, I hate that they think they can bully me and pick on me as a scapegoat, it's not wrong to have a reaction to that unfairness, how dare they!  I took a moment to check in with my current status, noticed my daily coffee ""wasnt working."" I'm fed up, wanted to smash things, knew they would laugh at me if they heard me smacking pillows (humiliating away any expression of anger). I checked in with my body, and my core was tense, but ""I'm not actually angry"" was my truth. I wasn't expecting that to be honest. I inquired further: ""I am not angry. I made my coffee anyway and drank it despite their subtle attempts at control. I did not cave to their attempts like I used to. I have done nothing wrong and I'm not actually angry at all.""

The tension released a bit but not completely. The physical symptoms seem to point to anger? I think I am processing some leftover grief: that this is the reality, and that for years I attempted to mitigate the *PROJECTED* shame by altering my behaviors and unintentionally denying my needs because of their negligence and volatility. I used to be VERY hard on myself about this, but this sub helped me redirect to the source: unchecked uBPD abuse. I'm allowed to be angry at the unfairness that random occurrences (like uBPD and nparent's anniversary, which was *their* choice, and has *nothing* to do with me i.e. is not in any way or form my fault), will *still* affect my life as of now, in the form of stupid passive-aggressive comments and thinly-veiled projection that I have to hear as soon as their footsteps meekly shuffle into the kitchen (behind me, always from
behind 🙄) and then I know what's coming. because it always does. I now fully understand I did nothing wrong, but I am still going to hear about it. 

I'd rather not hear a single word of this b.s., but I cannot afford to live elsewhere, and I am done internalizing shame for an economic situation that I had nothing to do with, for managers who do not protect their employees from harassment, and the time it takes to recover from past boyfriends who do not respect boundaries. Today? Today I made a cup of coffee. That's it. And I also lingered in the kitchen for longer than I'd like to, because the dishwasher drain needed cleaning. I decided to clean it, because I was in the mood, and I did not let uBPD question me or instruct me on how to do it ""properly"" (like they have) when they dont even clean or know how it works. I simply cleaned one piece, left the second piece for another day, and they took that opportunity to stroll by and make that comment, probably because nparent isn't talking to them much, who knows. they really took that out on me by projecting. I made a cup of coffee today and cleaned something in someone else's house (because let's be real, when have I had the same freedoms here that my parents do) and that is all. an immature parent threw a mini tantrum and I finished my coffee anyway. I have nothing to be ashamed over. I didn't ""make a mistake"" by choosing the ""wrong"" time to fix the dishwasher. I didnt overlook something which caused that comment, they were probably going to do it at some point today or tomorrow anyway. There is no such thing as the right time (and therefore I didn't make a fatal mistake by ""missing"" something) around someone who does not self-regulate well and picks on victims to expel it outwards (yesterday, it was the pet getting picked on).

I think my body is just acknowledging all the times I was falsely led to believe that the circumstances *WAY* outside my scope of responsibility were projected onto me unfairly. Now that I have a better awareness of boundaries (and went through the agony of fighting back, because yes they fought me on it, and I wasn't backing down) now there's no rainbow shining when I drink my coffee like today, there is no reward for me protecting these normal-to-have boundaries, besides a little less aggression and a little more peace. they still try and get through to me, and I guess they really always will. the comments have gotten less and less, they got less aggressive as uBPD went from witch to passive-aggressive waif, but it's there. I guess my body is acknowledging that this is entirely unfair to me, but at least the anger is no longer directed at myself. Id rather be a person who sees the truth anyway, even if it makes me angry—it should. I think next time an anniversary comes up, I will hear even less, and then I'll still be mad that I had a situation where I had to do that BUT I'll be glad that I'm standing strong in my boundaries anyway.",2,1739912399.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False

**February 18, 2025**

**BRONX** \- While February is Heart Health Month, given the statistics, heart health should really be a priority all year long. 

In New York State alone, almost 18% of adults 65 and older report they have some form of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 27% of all deaths are the result of CVD. And here’s another alarming fact: While many factors can increase the chances of cardiovascular disease and stroke, people with diabetes have twice the chance of developing CVD compared to the population as a whole.

As a registered nurse and care manager at the home- and community-based health care nonprofit VNS Health, I work with individuals who often suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. Diabetes in particular is common, especially among people of color. Diabetes is a challenging disease to manage, and it can feel overwhelming to contemplate other ailments on top of a diabetes diagnosis. But managing your blood sugar levels should be top-of-mind for the 1.8 million New Yorkers with type 1 or 2 diabetes, as well as their caregivers. 

For diabetics, blood sugar impacts blood vessels, increasing the chances that blood flow to the heart is impeded or stops, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. This is in addition to the normal aging process, in which our blood vessels become less flexible, making it more difficult for blood to move easily. These factors can combine to increase the chance that someone might develop cardiovascular disease.

The good news is many of the same things you may already do to address your diabetes can also lessen your risks for cardiovascular disease. For people with diabetes, in addition to regularly monitoring your blood sugar and taking medication as instructed, there are several lifestyle steps you can take that will help protect your heart health, and we all have the power to make positive changes to our health!

Here are a few tips on how to manage your diabetes and protect your heart:

Choose the Right Meals

For diabetics, watching what you eat is especially important, so keep “heart-healthy” foods in mind next time you head to the grocery store. Fresh fruits and veggies high in potassium and magnesium, whole-grains, and food with “good cholesterol” like avocados, nuts, and olives are great places to start. I often encourage my clients to plan their meals in advance, and swap out certain ingredients for something healthier where they can—like making a sandwich with whole grain bread, using a spice mix instead of salt, or making orange juice fresh at home rather than buying a pre-made brand. 

Sometimes those we care for struggle to afford food, or physical mobility issues make it difficult to shop—but there are resources such as local food pantries, free food delivery services, and others that make it easier to access fresh produce and other healthy foods.

Stay Active

Even moderate exercise can make a marked difference in your heart health. For people who have physical mobility issues or are primarily homebound, a little creativity can be helpful. You don’t need a full gym at home—start with small steps (literally). This might mean taking the stairs for a few floors instead of the elevator, or using a can of vegetables to “lift weights,” or doing leg exercises while you watch TV. Another approach is to break up exercise into manageable increments of ten minutes at a time, and set an alarm reminder for yourself.

One important note: Whether you have serious challenges with physical mobility or not, you should consult directly with a clinician before you start a new exercise regimen. Your doctor, nurse, or rehabilitation specialist can provide guidance on how to exercise safely.

Reduce Stress

Stress is a big trigger for high blood pressure, and reducing stress should be a priority for all of us. There are many relaxation techniques you can try—from deep breathing exercise, meditation, yoga, journaling, prayer, and more—so find what works for you. Another great way to de-stress is to plan quality time with loved ones, even if it’s just a weekly phone call or meeting up with a friend for coffee.

Get a Proper Amount of Sleep

Getting enough sleep is another important part of self-care. Most adults need at least 7–8 hours of sleep nightly. Keeping your room dark at night and avoiding screen time right before going to bed will also help ensure a sound sleep.

Stop Smoking 

No way around it, smoking has no health benefits, and is especially dangerous if you have diabetes. If you smoke, you’re more likely to have heart disease, kidney disease, eye problems, peripheral neuropathy, and nerve damage in the legs and arms that causes weakness, numbness, and pain. Quitting can be tough, but there are free resources out there, like calling 1-800-QUIT NOW or going to smokefree.gov.

Find Your Champions and Highlight the Positive! 

Making lifestyle changes can be hard but know that you are not alone. When checking in with my patients, I remind them that it’s important to celebrate progress and it’s also okay to have “off” days. What’s most important is to stay positive and do your best to be consistent. You may want to ask friends or family, your home health aide if you have one, or your clinician, to act as your “champion” and help you stay motivated. Putting forth your best effort, no matter where you begin, is a great way to start on the path to getting – and staying– healthy.

He said he understood and helped me load up the car. 

And then we sat down to say goodbye and cover anything we needed for closure. The roses he gave me for Valentine's Day (an hour before he passed out drunk on the floor so we couldn't be intimate) were on the coffee table and it felt like a bad joke. I was ready to go, I was fully resolved and I wanted to talk it through so we could both move on without regrets about anything left unsaid.

He admitted that he's felt guilty about dating me from the first day we were together. He says that  I've been what he considers ""a good person"" all my life, and he feels like he ""stole"" me or tricked me into a relationship, and doesn't really deserve a good partner. When I arrived in a sexy dress for Valentine's Day  he realized I was hoping for intimacy and immediately panicked and sabotaged the situation because of this guilt and the way he worries he's going to ruin my life somehow. He says that knowing I want this thing from him makes him not want to do the thing.  And that me being so open and direct about how I feel and what I want and need makes him want to distance himself and shut down. He apologized, and said that he wanted me to stay and give it some more time. So he is aware of what he's doing, he is aware of how it impacts me,  and he says he will ""work on it""

It seems fairly hopeless and the amount of shame he is carrying makes me so sad. Just my wanting and needing makes him feel so ashamed.  He's NOT a bad person. Not at all. But I'm not optimistic about his ability to change or my ability to change in this situation. 

But unfortunately, I just.... stayed. Again. The weekend ended up having  a lot of intimacy (for us) but I am doubtful it will last. Is it wrong to give him more time when I am so doubtful of the outcome? I feel like I know how this will end, but I am hoping for a miracle. ",6,1739911946.0,DeadBedrooms,12,0.88,False

At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of these sequential habits but none of the apps I found really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn. It’s now [available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498) Feel free to reach out with any feedback that you might have on the app if you decide to try it out.

We have been together for 6 years and are engaged, though we are waiting until I graduate to set up a wedding. We are also both in PhD programs, which we find stressful but both enjoy. I believe my program is quite intense, with most people around me coming in 6 days a week and routinely spending 8-10 hours a day each of those days. My fiance and I barely break 40 hours a week and take most weekend days off. I would like to work more hours so I can graduate quickly but she has pretty much always told me that I need to find that time by getting better organized, stand up to my boss, sleep less, or cancel my hangouts with friends or family, who I really only see once every two weeks. Thing is, i do all those things. I'm chronically tired, routinely dismiss my bosses for the sake of saving time, see my friends rather rarely, have given up participating in all my hobbies except for maybe once a month, and still rush to work, rush through the day, and rush home to make it back to her.

To be fair to her, she has chronic and severe depression and anxiety and chronic pain. She does ask for a lot of help, and I believe her when she says she needs it. I make most of her appointments, go with her to all new appointments, call and fight the billing people, and share all medical bills, including exercise classes to conquer pain. She is incredible. She is beautiful, funny, smart, and deeply interesting. I enjoy being around her when the stressor of work is not over my shoulder. 

Here lies the problem. I have tried everything to work more, but she seems to throw up obstacles every time.

Going in early? Great idea. But I need to wake up and make her coffee and lunch before I go.

Want to go to bed early? Great, but she's going to watch TV in bed.

Want to try going in late and getting all chores done in the morning? Great, but she needs me to wake up and drive her to her early classes, then pick her up at the end of the day (she has a car and parking pass, mind you)

Want to hang out with friends this weekend? Keep it to 2 hours please.

Want to have them over? She's tired and doesn't want to host.

We had friends over? Well now you can't go to work. You used up your time, sorry.

Want to work from home to get some extra hours in? I'd like to just sit down, because you working is making her feel guilty. 

I'm going in? Great, so can you, but you have to be finished at the same time I'm finished.

I have a doctor's appointment? I hope you're not planning on going in.

It's a holiday at my university but not yours? Please do a half-day so we can hang out.

Not all of these are all the time, but at least *one* comes up every time that I need to do work, resulting in me working as short as 3-4 hour days several days a week. I have tried to tell her I'd like to work more and have an exercise routine, but she tells me I either need to be more efficient with my time (I am running around nonstop at work), wake up earlier, or just says this is what being an adult is like. Then, if I do convince her I'd like to stay late one or two days this week, she calls me that day and asks me to come home earlier than we'd discussed.

I understand that I am an adult, and I need to give up hobbies for the sake of more important things like chores, financial planning, date nights, quality time, and taking care of the house and dog. But I also feel like completing my work should be a very high priority. It feels like my career is a low priority, substantially lower than quality time and helping her conquer her anxiety and health issues.

I'll add that we tried couples counseling on zoom, but she didn't like it because she felt that the councilor didn't understand her. 

Does this seem like incompatibility, or controlling behavior? Does it demonstrate abuse? I know that may be extreme, I would love to give her the benefit of the doubt because she is really incredible, but I find myself so stressed that I really don't know what to think.",11,1739911250.0,relationship_advice,61,0.8,False

1isn0uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/perimenopause_under45/comments/1isn0uc/extremely_anxious_today/,Extremely anxious today,"It all started yesterday. Long story short- our kids were off of school and we had left some of them chores to do which they did not do. On top of that, we have foster puppies who one of the kids took outside and they strew dirt and mud all over the house. When I got home from work, my son was trying to clean it up but I ended up having to mop, then make dinner. My husband was out last night. I didn't stop working until 8:15 pm after waking up at 4:30 am. Then my husband came home late and accidentally woke me up, so now I've been up since 1:45 am. 

I got to work today and was exhausted, so I had more coffee. I knew I shouldn't have, but I was so tired. I started having some frustrations at work and at that point, I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and I was having a total panic attack. I went to the supply closet and just started bawling. Thankfully, I had the idea to bring my meds to work so I took one before I started hyperventilating. I felt a little better after that but it's still like there's an elephant on my chest.

I can't wait to get to an HRT doctor. I do have anxiety but I think this is more than anxiety, obviously. And I'm exhausted. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Thankfully, my husband understands. We had a conversation about it and I was like, look, I need you to believe me. And he said he does and he will support whatever decision I make. My kids don't really understand why I've been so crabby, though.

1isn00d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1isn00d/a_few_story_beats_from_a_dingedup_entrepreneurs/,"A few story beats from a dinged-up entrepreneur's future memoir, for anyone who's ""going through it"" right now.","Been writing some notes for a memoir some friends have been trying to convince me to write for a few years now. Thought it would be fun to share my rambling here, just in case it helps anyone else feel less alone -- god knows I've needed that more times than I can count, and rarely have I found it.

Lost my dad at 14 to medical malpractice just before 9/11. I was the kid in school everyone picked on until the week after the funeral. A frequent bully taunted me in algebra class. I walked across the room, past the teacher, grabbed him by the collar and told him if he ever spoke to me again I’d beat the shit out of him. Then walked out and to the principal's office.

That’s when I realized confidence was something you could just *make the fuck up*.

Went to Virginia Tech for architecture. Always wanted to do that, since I was 8, though I can't fully remember why other than thinking the little models at the Naval Academy looked cool.

Finally Googled *day in the life of an architect* and immediately realized I was in deep fucking shit and architecture was going to make me miserable.

Decided to switch my major to graphic design. Went home for Spring Break and told my mom. She was so supportive and happy for me. A few weeks later, she died suddenly.

I became executor of two estates, my parents' and my grandparents'. Spent the summer of '06 clearing out my grandparents’ house and getting things in order to list it so I could go back to school, since I had nowhere else to be. Turned 20. Made it back to school for the Fall semester.

Virginia Tech shooting happened, starting in my dorm building. Lost friends. Watched friends grieve. Emotionally shut down and went into caretaker mode. Redlined mental collapse for the next year.

Sold the house.

Took a “professional writing” class with the former editor of *Golf Digest.* Something clicked even though I didn't know it at the time.

Had a full-on breakdown. Dropped out of school the day before I was supposed to go back for Fall semester '08.

For a year and a half, I basically stared at my ceiling.

After that, after years of feeling completely broken, I surprised myself by just feeling... *bored*. Feeling bored told me I had something in me to actually *do* something again.

I bought a laptop so I wouldn't have to spend all my time at my desk. Started writing online at the coffee shop. Started reaching out to people, pitching them on writing for their companies. I had no idea what I was doing, but I realized something: the pitch didn’t matter as much as *who* was open to the idea in the first place. It was just a numbers game.

On a fluke, just by already being writing at the time, I timed it perfectly to ride the content strategy and UX copywriting waves on their way up. Wrote for some incredible people.

One day, I landed a contract with a giant engineering consulting firm. They had no real starting point for sales materials and case studies, so I came up with my own approach to getting infodumps out of their 40 different division heads quickly and wrote new materials for all of them in like six weeks. Realized *I can just make up the process I think is going to work.*

Not long later, I was living alone in a farmhouse in the hills of North Carolina. Great for a quiet writer life when you can go into town whenever you want, *hell* when the world shuts down and nobody's in town when you get there. I learned something huge: I *need* to socialize a lot more than I realized in order to stay mentally healthy.

So when a space+nuclear company recruited me, I took the job. Moved to Seattle sight unseen because I needed to be around people again.

Company burned through $200M with little to show for it. Stole thousands of dollars from every one of its employees. One of my friends confided in me that he'd been harassed for internally reporting a major issue. He died by suicide 3 weeks after our conversation.

I took FMLA leave when my watch started telling me multiple times a day that my heart rate was staying at 100bpm for longer than it's supposed to. Used all of my PTO, then quit with 0 days notice the day I was supposed to go back.

Finally *deeply* grasped the whole ""grass is greener"" thing in practice, not just theory.

Going back out on my own, I hit the ground running. Old clients, new clients, people wanted to work with me right away. And that’s when I had another realization:

Being a college dropout who works with rocket scientists and nuclear physicists *sounded* cool as fuck. But a lot of those people have no idea how to run a real business. And from a communication perspective? Most of them have nothing useful or interesting to say.

I realized I was the best part of that all along. I didn't need them for what I do to feel cool to me.

The thread running through all of this?

Just keep using your ideas to paint pictures of what’s possible for other people. Make them *excited* about their own future in the most human way possible.

And then do that to yourself. Appreciate yourself and what you can do as much as you appreciate anyone else. You owe that to yourself, even if it takes you a while to get there.",2,1739911108.0,Entrepreneur,0,1.0,False

1ismypr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ismypr/how_should_i_go_about_asking_a_coworker_on_a_date/,How should I go about asking a coworker on a date?,"I (M) work in a different department than  my coworker (F), and we have never actually talked before, but we sit relatively close to each other. We both exchange glances quite often and we frequently catch one another looking at the other and there are sometimes smiles involved. I know this could be interpreted as a coworker just being friendly, and there is a small chance that this is the case, but I confidently believe this is more than just being friendly. There is a pretty clear indication that she is interested, through her body language, eye contact, etc, and honestly I don’t think I have conveyed my interest to her as much as she has conveyed hers to me.

I haven’t been able to properly introduce myself because of the circumstances. For example, we don’t work on any of the same stuff, we are never in the break room at the same time and it doesn’t help that my manager sits near her, so it’s been difficult to actually initiate or engage in a conversation. The opportunities just really aren’t there, so my thought was to message her on Teams and say something like,

“Hey I know this is random, but I think you are very cute. Would you have any interest in getting coffee or grabbing a bite to eat with me sometime? No hard feelings if not, I just figured I’d ask because I would love to get to know you“


I know most people think it’s a terrible idea to date a coworker as the saying goes, “don’t shit where you eat/sleep”, but I will not be working for this company that much longer so I want to shoot my shot. I’m in my 20’s and life is too short to not take risks and obviously if I get rejected, I will own it and not pursue anything further.

Any and all advice is appreciated! It would be helpful to her feedback from a woman’s perspective if they were in my coworkers shoes. How would you respond to a coworkers message like the one above?

Hey all! Some of you may have seen our posts on some other subreddits. We launched on Valentine's Day and are currently 21% funded. We are trying to reach a goal of 15,000 dollars in order to pay for the remainder of the pages, and do our first printing.

Our book is a fully rhyming graphic novel, (Think Dr. Seuss for adults, both in subject matter and vocabulary) and tells the story of a fictional prank war between Al Capone and Bugs Moran, which culminated in the Valentine's Day Massacre.

If you do not know about the massacre, it is a very interesting chapter in mob history because of how little is known about it. Allegedly, Al Capone sent 2 of his men in a fake raid to the warehouse of his north side, Irish rival, Bugs Moran. Despite being the person that Al Capone was really going after, Bugs Moran was the only one who survived. There are differing accounts as to why he was not there. Some people say he was getting coffee, other's say he overslept, and some say he was tipped off. 

That's the real story. ""The Original Gangster: A Historically Inaccurate Retelling of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" has a very different take on what happened, complete with Capone, Moran, bootlegging, gore, a whorehouse run by an intense madame, doppelgängers, explosive diarrhea, a party, a redheaded whore, burying bodies, a man with a mustache, the formation of the crime syndicate, Elliot Ness and his Untouchables, the Internal Revenue Service, the history of the Irish and their relationship to potatoes, pranks, and of course… syphilis.

Please take the time to check out our project! We have our Main Cover, an NSFW add-on cover which will be available if enough people are interested, a Limited Edition St. Paddy's Day Cover only available the last week of the campaign, and of course, our Secret Cover which will only be printed directly onto the book. Please check us out! Below is the Prologue and Chapter 1. It is also in our Kickstarter video, and Chapter 2 is available on the bottom of the Kickstarter Page. 

Thank you for checking us out! Your backing would mean the world to us.

I don’t own any other colors that are this sparkly. It’s almost aggressive lol.  Zooming into pic one will show some of the colorful sparkles mixed in there. Two pics in direct sun, two pics in the shade. 

While I was painting my nails and added the second coat, I even thought, “did I do this wrong? The polish looks straight-up silver due to all the sparkles, I can barely see any purple..”   It looks good indoors, but outside in the sun - WOW - the first time the sun came out this week, while I was driving to work, my nails were almost distracting.  When I picked up my coffee, the barista commented on liking my nails, and he’s never said anything before. These are attention-getters in the sun. 🌞 

I used one coat Hardcore base, two coats Serpent’s Tongue, one thickly applied coat Sally Hansen quick dry top coat.   My nails still feel slightly textured, though not rough, even with the top coat.  If you really need a smooth texture, perhaps a different top coat would be best (my Speed Demon is pretty tapped-out, so I grabbed what I could at the grocery store - it worked fine, but it’s a thinner product than SD). 

I know we say it all the time, but there’s no way to capture the level of ✨sparkle✨ in a photo! This color is insane in the sun.  Indoors or in dim lighting it almost looks like a silver polish, I think because it’s just so densely packed with glitter & shimmer, but in the sun that pretty lilac purple really shows. 

Thanks for your help in choosing this one! I know I bought it because I saw one of you wearing it, and I wouldn’t have known what to wear this week without you guys giving your input!

Because of this, I started looking up some items that would promote this skill in a safe manner. I found a little table called The Little Balance Box that a child can use to pull up, lean on, stand, and eventually walk with. I sent a video of my LO “walking” with it a week or so ago . I saw her in person yesterday and she brought up the table and why he is using it. Then, while baby talking to my LO, she was commenting about learning to walk on his own and only when he is ready. 🙄 I know the comments were directed at me. I gave her a confused look and she started saying “well he’s always been strong with his legs so..” as if trying to walk back the comment.  I told my husband that this irritated me and I feel like no longer sending pics and videos which I have already cut back on significantly.

More specifically, she is very good at copying the art styles of the children's books we read to our kids (3.5M & 2F). Shortly after we hired her, we noticed drawings appearing in the kid's arts & craft area that were darn near identical to the books.

On a lark, I asked her if she would be willing to draw a ""family portrait"" of us, but with myself, my wife (38F), and our kids as different characters from various children's book. Jane was elated by this idea and has been working on it diligently.

I want to give her something in appreciation for the portrait, but just giving her cash feels icky for some reason. The downside is, I don't really know much about what she likes...at all. She's very reserved about her personal life, and doesn't even eat while she's on duty because she practices intermittent fasting. Does she drink coffee? I dunno! Does she like novels? No clue! What about a gift card to Target? Beats me!

My only thought was to get her something art-related. A nice sketchbook? A beautiful artists pen?

I’ve had a pretty solid track record in BED recovery, especially since 2020 when I really started addressing my sugar addiction. My struggles began in early childhood and it’s only recently that I’ve felt some sort of peace with food.

However, lately, I have the worst food noise after lunch. I always eat breakfast and like to prioritize protein and fiber in my day-to-day eating. My meals all tend to be balanced (think: consisting of a complex carb, protein, vegetable, and fruit), but after I finish lunch it’s like something goes off and either I cant stop thinking about food or I can’t. stop. eating. It’s an insatiable craving for something dense and buttery, like a cookie or croissant. 

I’ve found that having a coffee or black tea after lunch helps, but I’d rather not have caffeine after noon. I’m trying to wake up earlier, and it really disturbs my sleep. Conversely I’ve also benefited from Ativan, but I would like to save my pills for emergencies.

I, Nick, am a gay male and back in the fall of 2003; after missing the bus after class my final year of college in Jan., I sprinted into a diner across from the bus stop to wait the hour for the next bus. As I drank a cup of coffee, the lone cook, Ray, and I started up a conversation as it rained. That casual talk eventually led to a casual dating to dating then a romance as I finished up extra courses in the summer of 2003. He told me of his being thrown out at 16 back in Arkansas and worked his way from there to California, landing the job as a dishwasher at that very diner, working his way up to cook while he got his GED.

 In Sept. of 2003, after securing my BA in business, my dad had just acquired another franchised investment branch of the investment group he had bought and named me manager of it. I offered Ray an assistant role to both help me and help him get a better job. After a few weeks of doing a great job, I convinced him to attend night classes to secure his degree in finance and move in with me. After getting his own degree after five years, I bought that investment branch from my dad and over the next three years added four more branches as well. Life was very good for both of us. 

We combined our social pages together when we married in 2010, a modest affair in Key West and he became part of my family. My parents, both brothers and sister welcomed him into their lives as one of us and slowly we began our lives. We purchased our first home in Orange County, a nice two-bedroom condo near the beach in 2011. Later on, we managed to purchase an A-frame cabin in Colorado, nestled near Denver and served as an Airbnb. When able, either family of we would spend a few weeks at a time there. Our work allowed us to travel a bit both in the US and abroad a few times a year either a weekend trip or the occasional week-long trip abroad, nothing glamorous or ostentatious, but nice, nevertheless.

Our social pages allowed us to post and share with friends and family, posting holidays with my family and pictures of our wedding, condo and renovations over the years, skiing in Denver and our trips. We4 also traveled to New York two times a year with either friends or family for shows and, of course, New Year's Eve celebrations. Even though we had our up and downs like all couples, we were always resilient.

After dad passed in 2015, he had acquired 8 investment branches scattered over southern California and had left two each to my brothers, sister and me. Mom was retired by then and he made sure she was very comfortable. She decided to retire to Austin, Texas where her family was from and was soon joined there by my sister and her family. We bought her inherited businesses from her and then in 2019, my oldest brother sold me and Ray his two businesses and he and his family moved to Maine where he and his wife retired near her family, seeking a slower way of life. Then in the fall of 2020, Ray had developed lung cancer despite being smoke-free and stepped back from the pressures of working so much to seek treatment. As the cancer progress, he constantly updated his post on social media, not only to document his journey but, deep down, hoping that maybe his family might care about him. Nothing. As he delt with chemo, I had stepped back from the businesses leaving my employees in charge as I spent more and more time with Ray.  

I removed the cabin from the Airbnb listings and we both settled in there in March 2021, complete with a full-time nurse for him and just lived quietly, occasionally hosting visiting family until Ray's death in August 2021 at age 43. It was then I decided to return to California and dived into work to keep my mind occupied. I rented our condo out and leased a small one-bedroom apartment near work and continued my life until I received a certified letter at my condo that was couriered to my apartment Sept. 20th, 2021. I could not believe what I read. After over two decades of absolutely no contact, no concern, no nothing, Ray's family had sent several legal pages of demands sent by a lawyer! According to them, I had forceable kept Ray a virtual prisoner, cutting him off from his family, hoarding everything he built for himself and destroying every letter, every plea from them for communication, denying him to ever add them to his (in their words) carefully construction social pages, rubbing in their faces everything Ray worked for and paid for so I could benefit from his labors! They even accused me of making him pay for all those vacations and isolating him from his family! Their demands, they wanted that cabin that he had bought alone. The condo that he had purchased that I forced him to add my name to. Majority ownership in those investments business that he bought claiming it was because of all the money that they had gave him in order to go to college to get that degree that I had forced him to beg them for! And, not sure how, they had included estimated amounts of money he had earn ever since he 'ran away from home to be with me' and demanded that as well! I hired a lawyer, and I went to war! Not for myself but for the life we had!

If anyone has showed an interest in the rest of this two-year battle, let me know and I'll follow up now that it's done and dusted.

I’m currently on the final countdown before my maternity leave begins on Friday. 
I will be 35 weeks on Saturday with my first and I am deeply looking forward to the time I have by myself before my world changes forever. This pregnancy has not been the most straightforward, we had a scare at the anatomy scan that fortunately resolved but was followed a few days later with a gestational diabetes diagnosis which risked me out of my desired care for my birth. 
Safe to say, it’s been challenging navigating this alongside the stress of an agency job that often finds me overwhelmed even before I got pregnant. 

I am so excited to be able to focus on enjoying the final weeks of this pregnancy, and preparing myself emotionally for this transition into motherhood. 

I have been brainstorming some ideas of how to spend this time, and thought I’d reach out to this community to see if there’s anything you wish you had done before you welcomed your first! 

My list so far:
- coffee shop visits to finish a few books I’m working through (the two I’m reading right now are ina May’s guide to childbirth and bringing up Bebe, please send recommendations if you have them!)
- journaling, I want to note down some experiences from this pregnancy for me to look back on and share with my daughter one day 
- long walks with the dog, fortunately I’m still feeling quite good in my body so going to keep this up for as long as I can 
- creating lists of things to do in my community with baby at various ages, researching baby groups and parent supports 
- resting and self care, letting myself have slow mornings, lazy days on the couch, keeping on top of skin care and staying well fed and hydrated 
- creating a list of all the things I want to eat post birth (this may be a GD thing but goddamn I dream about carbs) 
- doing all the baby laundry, getting the nursery all put away and tidied 
- visiting thrift and consignment stores to purchase the last few things we need for baby
- preparing nursing and diaper caddies for around the house to keep essentials close at hand 
- purchasing postpartum care supplies for myself 
- baking some lactation cookies. Fortunately our freezer is quite full of prepped meals already and we have a good support system in place for meals 
- Installing the car seat and getting the stroller set up


That is all I can think of at the moment, any suggestions, wisdom or anecdotes are greatly appreciated! ",6,1739909994.0,BabyBumpsCanada,21,0.88,False

On the highway when I drove above 90ish KMPH I noticed so much vibration in the car my coffee mug was shaking carzy, my steering wheel was also shaking. Any idea what can cause this?

My colleague who’s driving Kia also noticed it. Is there anything related to road conditions?

So, a little about me: I’m 23, 152cm tall, and weigh 40kg,istj and aquarius. I’ve got light brown skin and dark brown wavy hair.rn, I’m studying to become a primary school teacher, I’m a total homebody – tea> coffee any day, and I *love* spicy, salty foods>sweets

I’m really into anime and manga  they’re my escape and my inspiration. I also love drawing and am trying my hand at digital art these days. Oh, and I have this weird obsession with coloring things since i was a child– shells, rocks, clay figures, you name it. If it can be colored, I’ll probably color it! 😄  (I may be able to colour your life who knows ?👩‍🎨) oh and not to forget I'm really really really into flirting If you can consider it as a hobby 🤭.

Personality, I’m pretty independent. Being the oldest daughter, I’m used to figuring things out on my own i like to take care of the people i love. I’m also super empathetic – if I see someone crying, I’ll probably cry with them too because I just want to comfort them but i don't know how😭. I’m a great listener and love giving advice – my friends say I have the wisdom of an 80-year-old, even though I’m only 23. I’m also a rule-follower to a fault – even if breaking them would make life easier, I just can’t do it. And yeah, I’ve got a sense of humor – I love to laugh and make others laugh too.✋🙂‍↕️

When it comes to what I’m looking for, I’m drawn to mascs/butches between (21-27)– think short hair, athletic builds, and tattoos. A good sense of fashion and humor is a huge plus. And honestly? I kind of like the clingy, possessive side in someone – it makes me feel cared and loved. 😜 I’ve never been in a relationship before, so I’m looking for someone patient and understanding. I want to take things slow, learn together, and build something real. No games – just lots of hugs, attention, and love. 🫂💗  

Music-wise, I’m into pop, K-pop, jazz,rock I'm open to any loud song.. I don't want kids, and I’m serious about relationships – I put my whole heart into everything I do. I must also make things clear so that there is no misunderstanding and we start with complete honesty and transparency...I wear hijab and am a bit religious person, I respect your beliefs and won’t push mine on you.My relationships will certainly not be affected by my religious beliefs for sure ✋🙂‍↕️.

I’m all about sharing memes,reels, tiktok videos, having deep talks, and just seeing where things go. If you’re kind, serious, and ready for something meaningful, let’s chat!",1,1739909819.0,lesbianr4r,0,0.6,False

So, I’m a barista at a restaurant, but on slow days, I moonlight as a server. Enter: *The Table*. Three regulars—two guys and a girl with neon pink hair and enough chaotic energy to power a small city. Let’s call her… Pink Diamond (you’ll see why).  

**First interaction:** I’m taking their orders, and because I have zero chill, I ask Pink Diamond if she knows MBTI. Turns out she does! But when I guessed she was an ENFP (“the bubbly, creative type!”), she had no idea what that meant. She took the test on the spot… and bingo. ENFP. *Nailed it*. We vibed.  

**Second interaction:** I’m stuck at the bar. We exchange awkward “hellos” while I silently panic that I’ve become That Guy Who Diagnoses Strangers With Personality Types™.  

**Third interaction (aka The Incident):** They’re back. I’m their server again. We chat while they order—light, fun, nothing weird. But then… *the universe humbled me*.  

Before my break, I scribble a dumb inside joke on a napkin: “ENFP <3 ~ Pink Diamond” (yes, she *literally* looks like Pink Diamond from *Steven Universe*). I leave it on the bar, **fully assuming no one would ever see it**.  

Spoiler: *They saw it*.  

As they leave, Pink Diamond spots the note, reads it aloud, and goes, “*Ugh, he has no life.*” Cue me, across to the table i was setting at, freezing like a cartoon character caught mid-heist. I didn’t explain. Didn’t laugh it off. Just… absorbed the cringe. I wonder if she even noticed I noticed her and if she even knows who pink diamond is.

**So here I am.** Wondering if I’ve been unofficially crowned The Creepy Coffee Guy™. Was it the MBTI? The Steven Universe reference? The fact that I left a note like a middle schooler passing a crush a folded-up “Do you like me? ☑️ Yes ☑️ No”?  

Honestly? I’m over it… mostly. But if you need me, I’ll be in the walk-in freezer, marinating in secondhand embarrassment and wondering if ENFPs hold grudges.  

**TL;DR:** Tried to bond with a customer over personality types. Accidentally left a cringe-note. Got roasted. Send help (or memes).

1ismcol,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightlossdiets/comments/1ismcol/lifestyle_change_but_not_losing_weight/,Lifestyle Change But Not Losing Weight,"A few months ago (approx. 6 months) I decided to lose some weight and get my blood pressure down. As such, I introduced exercise and changed my diet completely. 

I briskly walk approx. 10km a day.
I stopped drinking alcohol in the week and limit the amount I have on weekends.

The most radical change I think is my diet / calorie intake and wondering if it is actually healthy / sustainable. I love the taste and texture of what I'm eating and look forward to my evening meal so, from that aspect, it is definitely something I enjoy and not a chore.
I don't eat breakfast except for 2 cups of coffee (no sugar, splash of semi skimmed milk).

Lunch (everyday) is an apple and banana.

Evening meal (everyday) is canned soup which I add a serving of brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage and either a serving of beans or tinned fish (alternates daily).

As a post meal snack an hour or so later I have a pear, tomato, a handful of sweets (approx 10 fruit pastilles) and a packed of low calorie crisps.

Throughout the day I drink water and in the evening I have a couple of glasses of zero sugar fizzy drink (pop).

I feel great, have lots of energy,  losing weight (still a bit overweight I would say) , blood pressure is down to normal levels, my cholesterol is back  within normal levels but, my weight has not budged (a couple hundred grams max).

What can I do to aid the weight?

Many thanks for reading and look forward to hearing from you",1,1739909565.0,weightlossdiets,0,1.0,False

1ismc8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ismc8m/valentines_day/,Valentines day.,"So me and the wife have, what i feel, falling apart. So Friday I gave her a 50 dollar gift card to star bucks. She loves the place but boy is it spendy, she loves their coffee. She then sent me a few spicy pics. I was giddy. 

9 am She spilled her coffee all over her lap. Calls me balling and wants me to run her a change of clothes. So I drop everything and bring her new jeans. Not a thank you. Your amazing. Nothing. 

I had flowers planned to be delivered at 10 am. They get delivered I get a selfie from her coworker just absolutely in love with them. My wife. Picture of the flowers asking If I sent them.

Yup. Do you like them? 
Sure.....

Its her friends birthday as well. So her girlfriend and friends where supposed to go out of town for the weekend. Plans fell through so they ended up staying in town.
Now i asked if the wife wanted to go out for supper she was really on the fence about it. But 2pm she goes... let's go out for supper. 

Went to the bar/restaurant and there her girlfriends are all enjoying themselves. So i got to hang out with the other husband.
I told him how disappointed I was with how my wife didn't care one bit about the gifts I got her. He kinda agreed.

Wife made a huge happy birthday post to her best friend on how she was amazing and a great friend and how she loved her so much. No happy valentines post to her husband. 

On our way home I made a comment how her coworker was the only one who enjoyed the flowers and it probably wouldn't look good on her Facebook profile if she showed love to her husband and also her friend.

1ismaqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamericanytsnark/comments/1ismaqr/yapbrinas_essay_on_her_ex/,Yapbrina’s essay on her ex,"Did anyone read Yapbrina’s essay on her ex boyfriend (cold brew man)? It’s on her substack and I read it out of curiosity. Of course, the essay is biased because we can’t hear cold brew man’s side but I’m surprised how childish both of them are. I’ll give a summary if you don’t want to read it.

The essay mainly talks about one thing that happened - cold brew man offering to make matcha lattes for her since there were no matcha stores nearby.

Cold brew man tells her that he is thinking of getting into matcha lately, which surprises yapbrina because she knows he’s an avid coffee drinker. Yapbrina thinks he’s doing it just for her. But then cold brew man says “it’s not only for YOU, I actually want to get into matcha for myself too”. Yapbrina gets upset. Cold brew man is making dinner for them and Yapbrina is so upset, she says she needs to leave. Cold brew man is visibly hurt and says that he knows it was wrong of him to make that comment, but he says it’s because his feelings for her are so strong sometimes, he feels like he does/says really strong things and this is what he does to tame his emotions.


First, what grown ass once divorced 35 year old man actually says this kind of thing? It screams childish. Not only that, it’s crazy that Yapbrina got upset enough by this one thing while her boyfriend was cooking dinner for them, to just get up and leave. Both of them have issues. There was a post a while ago from one of cold brew man’s friends defending him, and while I don’t think cold brew man is necessarily the horrible avoidant non-commital man Yapbrina portrays him to be, he definitely has issues as well",19,1739909433.0,asianamericanytsnark,12,0.95,False
