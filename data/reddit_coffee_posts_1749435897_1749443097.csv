Had two absolutely incredible meals this weekend and wanted to share the love...

Shout Out #1
Hong Kong Station 2go -  first time trying the second location (getting the food 2 go as the name implies) and first time trying the Szechuan Pork Belly (think it's called twice cooked pork on the online menu) and Beef Chao Fan...after a long day of yard work this was mind blowingly delicious (paired nicely with an ice cold Italian Pilsner from Upslope)

Shout Out #2 Bull and Bush Brewery for Brunch
First off, the service at this place is always top notch, efficient, friendly, but not over bearing....
For brunch we shared ""The Cure"" (with Chorizo) and the Brunch Chicken Fried Chicken, my wife and I almost got into an argument trying to decide which one was better, both were absolutely stellar and paired well with the Genessee Espresso Stout (brewed with Corvus Coffee)

Nothing like being absolutely delighted after enjoying a meal!

Oh little hatchback, swift and spry,
A 2016 star beneath the sky,
You carried dreams and coffee runs,
Through city streets and setting suns.

You weren‚Äôt the loudest on the lane,
No roaring beast or badge of fame,
But in your hum, I found my peace,
A quiet joy that will not cease.

Your fold-flat seats, your endless space,
Made moving life a simple grace.
From weekend trips to midnight drives,
You kept adventure well alive.

Gone now, too soon, my faithful friend,
Not by rust, nor time, but a violent end.
Struck from behind in a blink, a flash.
Metal on metal, a thunderous crash.

Goodbye, old friend, small warrior true,
You got me there, and safely too.
You gave me safety, joy, and grit,

Please give me some ideas of a good place for us to meet up. It could be in the middle somewhere, or closer to either one. 

We‚Äôre two families, with kids between 5 and 9 years old. We‚Äôll be in a motorhome, so it needs to be somewhere we can easily park that.

I‚Äôm thinking of either a nice lunch spot which the kids will enjoy and hopefully has a decent play area, and/or a park which also has somewhere we can grab some coffee/pastries on the way. There must be hundreds of good places but since neither of us know the area we need your help.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Anywhere between Sunshine and GC

After covid he flew back town and invited me to open a business which ultimately failed. However he saw an opportunity in a basic business. Let's just say it is a business in coffee, tea, ice cream, something you see and easily you can get anywhere.

I ended up going back to office while he started this business. He simply replicates another store just changed the recipe and logo. He got some hardship when opening, i lent him some money and he payed it back. Happy for his success, truly.

1 and a half year passed. Here i am still stuck on office while he is up to his 4th store. Thinking now, i felt like i can just open the same business, simply change the recipe and logo.

Talked to him and turned out he thought it is not ethic. We had a conversation, basically my point of view is, it is not a proprietary business, it wans't a tech business or something hard. It is just a normal business like tea, coffee, fruits, etc. He also replicate another business. But now i tried to get into the space, i understand we will become competitor as we are sharing the same marketplace.  But i also long to be a successfull person.

1l6vlmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FengShui/comments/1l6vlmm/adhd_and_feng_shui/,ADHD and Feng Shui,"Hello Feng Shui Experts,

My friend recently made a number of Feng Shui suggestions for my home and it felt overwhelming through the lens of my ADHD. I‚Äôve searched online and found very little guidance on how Feng Shui and ADHD can coexist. With the help of AI, I‚Äôve distilled a personalized system for navigating my space and focus needs. I‚Äôd be grateful if you could review the approach below and share any feedback or additional recommendations:

## ADHD and Feng Shui

*Preserving energetic clarity, minimizing friction, and honoring intuitive neurodivergent design.*

Traditional Feng Shui principles, while aiming for harmony, can sometimes conflict with the practical requirements of neurodivergent individuals. The core principle of Feng Shui is creating a space where energy (Chi) flows smoothly to support well-being and purpose. For individuals with ADHD, that smooth flow depends heavily on minimizing the friction between them and the tools or spaces they need to access. Therefore, accessibility, visibility, and unobstructed physical movement become key elements of harmonious energy flow. Forcing items into certain spaces based purely on traditional rules, if it introduces barriers or increases cognitive load, can disrupt the very harmony Feng Shui aims to achieve.

For executive function support in ADHD, the key is adapting Feng Shui principles into a neurodivergent-friendly design strategy that works with the brain, reducing cognitive demands and preserving precious mental energy.

### Key Principles to Consider

Think of daily energy for those with ADHD like a phone battery with a finite charge, which, unlike people who may not consider the energy cost of basic tasks, must be meticulously budgeted. Activities like setting up last-minute meetings, interrupting focused work, or even tasks requiring unnecessary extra steps (e.g., complex storage for daily items, navigating around obstacles) act like sudden, massive power drains, halting momentum and potentially causing severe overwhelm. Pushing past limits doesn't just mean being tired tomorrow; it risks a system crash requiring days of recovery and significantly reduced capacity afterward.

Therefore, simple, intuitive environments with visible, easily accessible essentials‚Äîminimizing steps, cognitive load, and physical friction‚Äîare the crucial charging infrastructure needed to prevent multi-day burnout and sustain focus.

*   **Accessibility and Visibility are Key:** For individuals with ADHD, having frequently used items within arm‚Äôs reach and sight supports focus, minimizes distraction, and reduces the mental burden of remembering where things are. ‚ÄúOut of sight, out of mind‚Äù is a very real challenge, so designing with consistency and visual reinforcement sustains executive function.
*   **Functional Zoning and Workflow:** Organize items in a way that makes sense for the individual's daily flow. Creating activity-specific zones‚Äîsuch as a work station, bedtime setup, self-care nook, or coffee prep area‚Äîhelps reduce decision fatigue and supports productivity by anchoring tools where they‚Äôre naturally used.
*   **Clarity of Movement = Clarity of Mind:** For those with ADHD, spatial and mental clarity are deeply connected. Interruptions to natural movement can be mentally taxing. Detours, blocked hallways, or inefficient layouts can trigger mental friction, disorientation, and decision fatigue. Direct, obstacle-free movement between high-use zones (e.g., desk to kitchen, hallway to bathroom) preserves crucial cognitive energy and momentum, reduces overwhelm, and keeps the nervous system regulated.

### ‚úÖ DO

*   **Prioritize Ease of Access & Intuitive Flow:** Keep frequently used items visible and directly reachable from where they are used‚Äîsuch as work tools at your desk, skincare on the sink, or nightstand essentials by your bed. This prevents energy leaks from repetitive searching or obstacle navigation. For ADHD minds, accessibility supports rhythm and predictability, not clutter.
*   **Create a ""Launching Pad"" & Activity Zones:** Designate specific areas‚Äîlike a hook, tray, or shelf near the entrance‚Äîfor keys, wallet, charger, or daily carry items. Implement activity-based ‚Äústations‚Äù for common routines. Whether it's a work zone, morning self-care area, or exit-prep corner, keeping all essentials for that activity grouped and reachable improves flow and eliminates last-minute scrambling.
*   **Create Clear 'Homes' for Items:** Establish consistent, visible locations where things belong‚Äîeven if that‚Äôs on an open shelf or surface. Don‚Äôt worry about tucking everything away. For ADHD functionality, predictability is peace. Reducing ‚ÄúWhere does this go again?‚Äù decisions decreases internal chaos and builds momentum. Remove excess items in bedrooms, especially work-related clutter, to restore rest energy.
*   **Use Open Storage with Visibility:** Choose open baskets, trays, shelves, wall hooks, or clear bins. These allow you to see what‚Äôs inside at a glance and reduce multi-step storage that drains energy. This strategy honors modern Feng Shui principles that embrace visibility as a tool for harmony, especially in small or shared spaces.
*   **Optimize Workflow Stations:** Arrange tools and materials logically by how they are used. For example, keep printer paper near the printer, coffee mugs near the coffee maker, or notebooks near the desk. Items should follow the natural sequence of tasks to reduce mental effort and keep your attention in rhythm.
*   **Support Energetic Flow:** Layouts should ensure spatial rhythm and prioritize direct, intuitive paths through the home‚Äîespecially between high-use areas like kitchens, workspaces, and rest zones. Interrupting these routes with clutter or clusters of objects can cause cognitive friction, disrupt momentum, and drain energy. ADHD minds rely on direct movement to stay in rhythm. Clear physical flow mirrors mental clarity; movement through space should feel instinctive, unbroken, and energetically smooth.
*   **Moderate Visual Stimulation:** Choose artwork with calming, spacious themes like soft landscapes or natural scenes. Reduce visual clutter and limit the number of images on the walls. Too much visual input‚Äîespecially covering every wall‚Äîcan fragment attention, accelerate mental fatigue, and prevent visual rest.
*   **Regulate Sensory Input with Grounding Design:** Use calming elements like natural textures (wood, stone, cotton), soft lighting, greenery, and earthy tones‚Äîincluding muted palettes and soft blues‚Äîto reduce overstimulation and anchor the nervous system. Representing the Earth Element in Feng Shui principles are especially beneficial for ADHD environments where nervous system grounding is key.
*   **Use Aromatherapy:** Diffusing essential oils like vetiver, lavender, or cedarwood can help regulate emotional overwhelm and restore clarity. Scent memory is powerful; choose consistent aromas for work zones or bedtime to strengthen state-based routines.

### ‚ùå DON‚ÄôT

*   **Don‚Äôt Hide Daily Essentials:** Avoid placing regularly used items behind closed doors, nested bins, or within storage systems that require multiple steps to retrieve. Complex containment = cognitive battery drain. Visibility and ease-of-access are not clutter; they are design allies for clarity, energy flow, and peace.
*   **Don‚Äôt Prioritize Aesthetics Over Function:** Avoid forcing design rules (like minimalism or ‚Äúno objects on the counter‚Äù) that interfere with real-life needs. If a critical cognitive anchor requests a visible system like a basket of chargers or a sink tray for skincare sustains flow, it‚Äôs functional harmony‚Äîeven if it breaks certain design rules.
*   **Don‚Äôt Force Complex Storage Systems:** Steer clear of highly segmented organizers, tiny compartments, or solutions that require precise placement to maintain. ADHD brains need intuitive systems with low maintenance. If it takes more energy to return the item than to leave it out, the system will fail.
*   **Don‚Äôt Mistake Clutter for Chaos‚ÄîRespect Functional Systems:** What looks like clutter to someone else may be an active working system for a neurodivergent mind. Function isn‚Äôt always minimalist. Respect the logic behind what‚Äôs visible vs. what is genuinely unused. Tidy can mean parallel lines, clear zones, or visible order‚Äînot emptiness. Intuition creates its own symmetry. Rearranging items based purely on aesthetics can unravel momentum, increase cognitive load, and damage emotional safety. Honor the flow-preserving logic embedded in lived-in systems.",1,1749442578.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False
1l6vkxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l6vkxe/i_27m_wish_i_never_met_up_with_my_online_friend/,I (27m) wish I never met up with my online friend (26m) of 10 years (LONG story),"I have such a mundane life, that I never thought I would have an interesting enough story to write into reddit, but the past 48 hours have been a complete nightmare, I couldn't pass up the chance.. I'm sorry, this is a long one guys, a lot has happened and I don't want to leave anything out.

I, 27 m, finally met my online best friend, 26 m, in person for the first time this weekend.
We met online in 2015 on an app called whisper, a social media app where you can anonymously post messages and pictures, comment on peoples' posts, and private messages. I was on vacation with my family after coming out as transgender (ftm) and posted on whisper asking if there were any other trans people who wanted to chat. My friend, let‚Äôs call him Sam, privately messaged me on the app, and we had an instant connection.

Sam has been there with me through a lot over the years (moving, job changes, relationships), but neither of us ever had the means to visit each other. We would have phone calls, text, Facetime video, you name it. We had breaks in our friendship where we didn't talk for a while, but no matter how much time had passed, we could always pick up right where we had left off.

About two weeks ago, Sam told me he is travelling close to my area for an event, and wanted to try and finally meet up. He was hoping to come Friday and meet up with me after work, go to his event on Saturday while I was working, come back Saturday night and get an air bnb, and head back home midday Sunday (today).

I have a lot of anxiety, but I knew that if I didn't say yes, we wouldn't know the next chance we would have to meet in person. So against my better judgement, I said yes. Fast forward to this past Thursday. My parents weren't comfortable with Sam staying in the house because they had never met him before, Sam knew this but he assured me he would find accommodations; whether it is finding an air bnb, sleeping at a truck stop in his car overnight, or finding a camping site between my parents' house and his event on Saturday. All sounded good. The plan was for him to leave in the morning Friday and meet me after I finished work around 4:30 pm.

I woke up Friday to a message from him at 3 am, saying he would let me know when he is leaving (it's about a 7 hour drive, and across the border), only for him to message me later saying he slept in. He didn't end up leaving until nearly 2 pm, meaning he wasn't going to be arriving until 9 pm. I figured, even though I was really annoyed, we could still have a good couple hours to chill and talk before the end of the day.

As I was finishing at work, he called and we talked about his drive so far, what we could do tonight, and agreed I'd go to a dispensary before they close, since we are both potheads. It was then he told me, ""you better have a pizza for me when I get there."" I responded, ""what? Why?"" and he said, ""because I've been driving all day and I'm going to be hungry when I get there."" I thought it was kind of demanding, but I understood where he was coming from, so I said fine and had the pizza order scheduled to arrive soon after he did.
I went home, tried to relax, and waited for this highly anticipated moment of finally meeting my long distance friend. I wait outside with my dog, scrolling on my phone and Sam pulls into the driveway. We hugged each other, sat on the front porch, talked for a few minutes before the pizza arrived, and agreed that we should call it a night around 12. Sounds good to me, I had to be up at 8:30 for work Saturday.

We smoke, we chat some more, and bounce around stories (ADHD made that interesting), and head inside around 11. We went to chill in my room, said hi to my parents and older sister on the way, and I grabbed Sam's pizza, leaving mine on the counter, intending to eat some after Sam left. My anxiety makes me very uncomfortable and nauseous when I try eating food when I'm nervous, but he was aware of this.

We spent maybe 30 minutes just chatting, when he asked if we could go smoke outside again. I said sure and we went out back for a bit. We went back to my room, and Sam was on his laptop when he told me he can no longer book an air bnb. I asked why, and it turns out after midnight, you can no longer book something for ""that night"" because it's considered the next day. It was at this point that Sam opened his pizza box and finally started eating his pizza (you know, the pizza that he so desperately needed as soon as he arrived).

We then spent the next hour looking for somewhere he can stay for the night. There were different cities between mine and the one his event was in, and he wanted to find a location that was EXACTLY half way, so he can drive some that night, and some the next morning. It's maybe a 4 1/2 hour drive to the event. We went through each city I mentioned but there was always something wrong with them.

The first city was a 1 1/2 hour and 3 hour split; he didn't want to drive 3 hours Saturday morning. The second city was a 2h 45m and 1h 45m split; that was too much driving for him right now. The third city was a 2 1/2 hour and 2 hour split; but that wasn't close enough to exactly half way. At this point it's 1 am, and I'm getting really tired after working all day, but I couldn't just kick him out without finding somewhere to sleep. We ended up finding a city that would be a 2h 20 minute and 2h 10 minute split, and apparently this time split was what he was looking for. Great, let's look for a hotel in that city and book it, right? WRONG.

He then finds a 4.3 star hotel, and borrows my phone to call the hotel, but hung up the phone without saying a word. ""Your phone sucks, I couldn't hear anything he was saying. Can you call?"" I was starting to get fed up, and grabbed my phone to call myself. I turned the volume up on the call and asked the man if we would be able to book a room for the night, to which he said yes. I look up at Sam, and he's not even paying attention to the call, not even looking at me. I ask the man on the phone if I can talk to my friend and we will figure out details to book the room.

I hung up the phone, told Sam about them having a room available, and handed him my phone to call back and book his room. He doesn't take my phone from me, but instead looks at me and says, ""Okay, well call them back and book me a room."" .... What.... I tell him absolutely not, I explain my anxiety on the phone and not having the information to book the room for him. He replies, ""you'll never get over your anxiety at this rate. Just call, I'll give you my credit card to book it.""

I flat out refuse to call the hotel back, at which point he says, ""fine, I'll just sleep in my car,"" and starts looking for truck stops between the cities. I'm getting increasingly tired and irritated, just playing dumb games on my phone, until he finds a spot and starts packing up his stuff for the night. He asked me to keep his laptop for the night, and he puts it in his backpack. ""yep, that's fine. We are hanging out tomorrow anyways.""

UGH! It's almost 2 am and we go downstairs. I hadn't eaten yet, and I'm about to crash. We are standing in the kitchen when Sam says, ""Can I say something unsolicited?"" I responded, ""Oh god, what is it?"" ... I sh*t you not, he looks dead in my eyes and says, ""I didn't realize how ugly your sister is."" WHO SAYS THAT. 

From that moment on, something changed and I no longer wanted to hang out anymore. I love my sister, and I guess I'm very protective of her, and this honestly broke my heart that he said this to me. I just turned white and said, ""Oh my god Sam, that's so mean! Don't say that."" He just laughs it off, and the send off was just weird. I felt so uncomfortable, and I ended up lying in bed after eating some food, overthinking how the next couple days are about to go.

Saturday, I get up for work, I am a complete zombie. Sam asked me to bring his backpack to work, because he forgot some stuff from it and needed it when he got back. I grabbed it in my slump/grumpy mood, and headed to the kitchen. My mom, bless her, asks me how my night was, and I'm honest with her, saying it was nice but I'm starting to feel uncomfortable/irritated about him not planning anything during this trip and keeping me up so late. She offered to have him stay here in the spare room Saturday night, but I just had this feeling in my gut that I did not want him staying with us. I told her I didn't want to, I was not going to offer it to him either, and I think that's when my mom was starting to pick up on my feelings. She drops it, I make myself a coffee, and head off to work.

Sam gets to his event and has a good time, and I am getting really anxious about the original plan; booking an air bnb and staying the night with Sam. As soon as Sam is done at the event and back on the road to my city, I let him know how much anxiety I'm getting about staying the night at an air bnb, because I've NEVER stayed at an air bnb before. He begs me to stay with him, so I just told him I'd think about it. This is around 3 pm, I won't be done with work until about 8. I had already decided in my head I was not going through with the air bnb.

A few hours go by, and I decide to text this to Sam: ""I don't think I can. I really liked the idea of it, but the more I think about it, I'm just too scared. I never used air bnb, I haven't slept in a bed that isn't mine in like 4 years. I can ask my mom again and see if you can stay the night here, but she said we woke her up a couple times last night. Maybe in the future, but I'm just not there yet."" I know, I lied. Honestly, I just really didn‚Äôt want to spend the night with Sam.

His response: ""We gotta work on your anxiety bro cause that's no way to live. Only you can do the work for yourself. It's a matter of if you want it, then you gotta do it. Tough love my guy. I just want to smoke and sleep."" This is where I pretty much just left it until finishing work. He met me there and waited until I was off, gave him his backpack, cleaned up and we headed over to my house again. By the time we had gotten up to my room and started talking about what to do for the night, it was 9:30. He was really pressuring me to still get an air bnb, showing me different listings nearby, but I kept saying no.

At 10:30 we had been going back and forth, and he said he is in a different country, doesn't know anything that's around, and would rather sleep in his car before staying at an air bnb himself, I just kept saying no. We both went quiet for a bit when he was getting really upset and said, ""why can't you just put your anxiety aside for one night?""
I knew for a fact that if we got the air bnb, I was not going to sleep and I would be extremely anxious. I knew we had to find something pet safe because my dog comes everywhere with me, and I wouldn't be able to go the night without her. I felt like I'd still need my space, and this listing had 3 beds. Well... I caved.

The people pleaser in me was overriding, and I picked an air bnb 30 minutes away and we booked it. I saw in the listing that it had the code for the front door  before booking, and was a little weirded out by it, but didn't mention it right away. It's a 3 bedroom, pet safe place with parking and wifi. We got the info and confirmation for the air bnb, packed up some stuff and headed to the car. I texted my mom the address (she knew I didn't want to go), and she texted me back that at any point I want to come home, just sent a message.

At 11, the car was ready, and he handed me the keys to his car, telling me to drive, since he was driving all day and was tired. I didn't want to start anything before spending the night somewhere new, so we got in the car. On the drive, I mentioned the front door access code was in the listing to Sam, and he got really sketched out, messaging the host about it. We ended up calling them to sort out the parking, got that situated, and took our stuff to the house.

We unlock the front door, and see a door in front of us with a key, and a staircase around the right corner. It's a split air bnb; 3 bedroom on the upper level, 3 bedrooms on the lower. We had booked the upper level, not realizing it was a split house, put our stuff down inside, and saw the bulletin for air bnb guests.. No. Pets. Allowed. Sam used the bathroom and came out seeing my worry, but reassured me the posting allows up to 6 people and 1 pet. That helped a bit, but I still had a bad feeling in my gut.

We went outside to smoke, and chatted for a few minutes before heading back in. I walked into the biggest bedroom with some of our stuff, and a spider is hanging from the ceiling right above the bed. I hate spiders, so Sam said he'd open the window and let it outside. It was at this moment we realized the window screen is broken, and the bedroom window doesn't lock. The spider fell, Sam said he ""dealt with it,"" and ""we are sleeping in the same bed now, you don't have a choice anymore.""

I sat on the bed, starting to panic. I listen to these types of stories on scary story podcasts; an air bnb with a stranger, someone breaks in, you get robbed, murdered, or both (Yes I know that's my anxiety talking, but I was starting to spiral at this point). Sam sat on the bed with me, and I started shaking, knots in my stomach. I did not feel safe, I was not staying here. I felt bad for making Sam spend money, and told him I can't stay. He said that if I'm leaving, that he is not comfortable staying here either.

As much as I felt I didn't want him staying at my parents, it is scarier for me to stay at this place than in my own house. I confessed to him that I lied about my mom offering the spare room for him to spend the night. I texted my mom that we weren't sober, and we were too scared to stay the night in the air bnb. I explained about the no pets allowed on the bulletin, the front door, the broken window, and I was having a horrible panic attack about staying the night. Sam was offered the spare bedroom, and my mom said she's on the way.

When I say this was the worst panic attack of my life, believe me. Sam and I sat on the bed talking for 15 minutes, then packed our things up and got tf OUT. We were just going to keep his car there and pick it up in the morning when we were sober again. My mom pulled into the driveway at nearly 1 am, and it wasn't until I opened the door that we saw my dad was also in the car. It was an awkward as hell 30 minute car ride, but we were both so thankful and made sure my parents knew that.

I told my parents I was sorry for keeping them up and telling them I wasn't comfortable with Sam in the house but I was more comfortable knowing he was staying at our house than the air bnb. I told Sam I was sorry I didn't just offer the spare room when it was first offered, and for keeping him up even longer. Sam told my mom that he was sorry for waking her up last night, and I realized I never told either of them I lied about that part (in my mind it was the reason my mom ""said he couldn't use the spare room"" the second night, but I hadn't clarified it to either of them).

My mom responded, ""You didn't wake me up last night?"" And Sam looked at me. I guess my mom saw me freeze and said, ""Oh. Wait. I.. thought it was you guys that woke me up, but I was just really hot last night. I don't think it was you guys."" That's pretty much where conversation dropped between Sam and I, and my parents for the last few minutes of the drive.

My parents were very easygoing with everything and tried to just make light talk with each other to ease the tension in the car. We got back to my parents house, made the bed for Sam and all headed to bed for the night. Sam was dealing with the host complaining about the car staying in the driveway, but when we brought up all our concerns about the air bnb, he shut up pretty quick. I messaged him saying that I was so sorry for lying to him, but he never acknowledged it so I wasn't sure where we were standing.

This morning I woke up with a pounding headache, messaged Sam to make sure he was up, and we took off for his car. He had all his things with him, and said he was just going to head home when he got to his car. Honestly, that was probably for the better since things had been so mucked up the night before, and there was still a lot of tension between us. He got his car, we made sure he was all sorted at a nearby gas station, and I bought him a couple drinks. We hugged and agreed next time we hang out, things definitely have to be planned out better. He started his drive home, and I headed home myself as well, ready for a nap already.

NOW.. I bet the past few paragraphs of this story, you have been confused about my feelings towards Sam. Honestly, so am I. Sam and I have been friends for so long, but I do recognize that some of the things he did this weekend are red flags and really controlling behaviours. I don't know if I want to continue this friendship with Sam, but I am so f-ing lost right now guys. I think I just want to know how other people see this post without being directly involved. My work friend and my sister both think I should ghost him, and my mom thinks I should cut him off.

I WAS still uncomfortable with Sam being in the house and riding in the car with my parents, but I didn't want to tip him off on how I was feeling towards him; the constant pressuring me to get an air bnb knowing how anxious I was, not taking no as an answer after saying it multiple times, not having anything planned and keeping me up until past 2 am on a work night for me, calling my sister ugly? It's been a really hard day trying to understand my feelings and emotions. Please. Help. Give me your input.",1,1749442514.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

(33F, 65F) We've known each other for ten years. NB started out as the  coach for my swim team but quickly grew into a friend of me and my mom's. I've also babysat for NB's dog and cats on multiple occasions. Well now NB is getting married to their longtime girlfriend. First NB decided to have the wedding on *my birthday*. Well, okay, that's fine. Maybe they couldn't get the venue for any other date. But my mom was originally supposed to be in NB's wedding party as a bridesmaid. The wedding is going to be really small, just 3-4 bridesmaids on each side and only close family and friends attending. A few weeks ago, my mom stopped receiving any information about the wedding, like no invites to rehearsal dinners or information about what kind of dress to get or anything like that. We just all thought it was because NB was really busy. The dress thing eventually got sorted out and now she has her dress, but today my mom and NB went out for coffee with some other friends and NB started talking about the wedding and the ""two bridesmaids"". Then NB was like ""Yeah you're not in the wedding party anymore sorry."" NB refused to explain why they had taken my mom out or why they had waited so long because they had apparently taken my mom out weeks ago and that's why my mom had stopped getting the updates. Now we're driving 6+ hours out of town ON MY BIRTHDAY and spending hundreds of dollars on a hotel so we can watch NB get married, and instead of being able to be next to NB and supporting them my mom's just going to be in the audience. I'm so pissed at NB because this is the first time they've ever done anything like that and they didn't even have the decency to explain to my mom that she was being removed from the wedding party or why.

Because your body can‚Äôt actually use what you‚Äôre eating as real fuel, even if you think it‚Äôs giving you energy.

Yeah, me too. Between work, side hustles, social plans (or the lack thereof thanks to Netflix), and a constantly buzzing phone, it‚Äôs like our minds are always in hyperdrive. **But what if I told you there's a magical pause button?** And no, it‚Äôs not the ""off"" switch on your computer. Let‚Äôs chat about a 5-minute breathing technique that can reset your nervous system while you sip your coffee.

**Studies say we're onto something here!** Science backs it up, fam. This isn‚Äôt just your grandma‚Äôs ""take a deep breath"" advice. This is a legit method to *calm focus* and keep that pesky cortisol (aka stress hormone) at bay. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

**So, what is this sorcery?** Let's break it down:

1. **Find Your Zen Space:** You don‚Äôt need a yoga mat in Bali. Just find your bedroom corner or your favorite chair. Whatever feels right.

2. **Sit Up, Not Stiff:** Make like a marionette with a soft string pulling your head up. Relax those shoulders, you‚Äôre off-duty.

3. **Breathe In, Hold, Breathe Out. Repeat:** 
   - Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 seconds.
   - Hold it. Yep, that‚Äôs for 4 seconds, too.
   - Exhale through your mouth for 6 seconds.
   - Rinse and repeat the cycle 5-6 times, or until your inner squirrel chills out. üí§

**Why this works?** Because when we control our breath, we control our stress responses. Ever noticed how your breath speeds up when you're stressed? This is like hitting the reset button. Instant chill vibes.

**But wait, there's more!** You might just notice:
- A boost in focus (because who doesn‚Äôt need a little clarity for that to-do list?)
- Reduced anxiety, which means more ‚Äúyou‚Äù time without the heart-racing.
- Better sleep later, thank you very much.

Why not give it a try next time your notifications ding, or your brain starts doing that anxious raccoon thing? ü¶ù‚ú®

I am making this post to extend a huge thank you to our growing group, and for another successful title that our members have enjoyed. For those who were unable to attend the last novel, we had the pleasure of reading Donna Tartt's third seminal work, *The Goldfinch.* In every facet, it is an amazing book, and I cannot recommend it enough. I think it is safe to assume that we will be reading another one of her works sometime in the not-so-distant future. 

This month, we are taking a bit more time until the next meeting to read *Heavy, An American Memoir*, by Kiese Laymon. This should be a great change of pace from the fiction we have been reading, towards something that offers a great amount of perspective. I can say for myself, just by reading the first paragraph alone, am looking forward to reading this book. We will be discussing the memoir in its entirety on Saturday, June 28th 11:00 AM at Sayfani Coffee House off of West McDermott Drive in Plano/Allen.

For anyone interested, come check us out! We are always accepting new members! Attached is my book club's official page with more details.

But some people still like to do roleplay playthroughs and plenty likewise have runs they prefer to think of as their ""true"" playthrough of the game. The way they like to imagine that their Joker is and thus no matter how many times they play the game again that one is their ""canon"". So I thought it might be fun to ask others what their ""canon"" Joker's love life was like and why.

For example, while I did have Joker romance Makoto on my very first playthrough of the game, and I'll likely have him romance Ann in my most recent one, and I don't think Joker has any bad love interests in the game, it's my second playthrough that I consider to be my ""canon"" playthrough, since I had a much better idea of the game, its story and characters, that I actually completed all the confidant stories and unlocked the 3rd semester in, and likewise with the way I preferred to play Joker and liked to imagine him to be the person who felt most fitting for him to romance was Haru.

She always felt the most fitting with the way I was playing Joker and I find their relationship really sweet. Bonding over coffee and taking care of plants and their similar senses of humor. Haru actually having someone taking an interest and valuing both her and the things she cares about. Joker finding her just really easy to talk to and get along with. Weirdly even how late into the game she's brought in feels like a bit of a factor too, like Joker didn't realize he'd been waiting for someone like her all this time until she entered his and they started hanging out. The idea of them maybe someday running a caf√© together like Sojiro's is certainly one he's found himself thinking about more than a couple of times.

Plus I like the idea that my Joker happily considers himself to be a ""bad influence"". I love the image of Haru running around Mementos terrorizing the shadows with her axe and grenade launcher and Joker's just leaning back against the cat-car with a cup of coffee and a smile on his face as he watches the mayhem and calls out ""Go get 'em, honey!"" in support. He's not why she's got a bit of a sadism streak going...but he's doesn't feel much of a need to hold it in check either.

And, hey, I like Morgana, and I like to believe that his chuckle on Valentine's Day is him giving himself credit for the two getting together, since he's the one who brought Haru into things.

# I

*They say memory fades, but some things never really leave you.*

*I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this down now. Maybe someone, someday, will need to understand what it was like. before everything changed.*¬†

I‚Äôve always taken the subway.

That‚Äôs just how it goes for most people in New York City. Cars can drain your wallet, and it's not worth it for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt have cash to spare or the patience for the hassle of alternate-side parking. Having a car here feels less like a ticket to freedom and more like a burden. According to Google, about half the city‚Äôs residents feel the same way. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not a bigger number. Just dealing with traffic can age you a decade. I‚Äôve watched cabs sit through a single red light cycle three times without budging an inch.

Of course, it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing and neatly folded newspapers. The MTA has its fair share of madness. Delays, reroutes, those mysterious ‚Äútrain traffic ahead‚Äù announcements, and the people. Not everyone is a problem. Most of us are just trying to get from point A to point B with our headphones in and our eyes down.¬†

But then there are the others, the quirky ones. The subway performers who treat the A train like it‚Äôs their stage at the Apollo. The cat-callers who think shouting a compliment across a crowded car is the way to someone‚Äôs heart. The folks sprawled across three seats, deep in slumber. And then there are the homeless, many quietly navigating life underground, blending into the scenery, while others make their presence felt in ways that are hard to overlook.

It‚Äôs a lot to take in. It can be overwhelming. It used to be for me.

I didn‚Äôt grow up here. My family moved to the city when I was seventeen, right in the middle of junior year. We came from a small town in Pennsylvania, the kind of place where doors are left unlocked and everyone waves, whether they know you or not. But my mom was ready for a change. She craved a fresh start, something bigger and louder than the quiet life we‚Äôd been living. I think the city was more of a distraction for her than anything else.

So we packed up what we could, sold off what we couldn‚Äôt, and ended up in a tiny, third-floor walk-up. That first year was a tough one. The city felt alive, like it had its own heartbeat, always bustling and demanding something from you. But as time went on, I started to find my rhythm. The clattering of the trains, the cadence of the announcements, and the way you begin to recognize familiar faces during your morning commute, even if you never exchange a word with them.

Now, the subway feels like a second home. A peculiar kind of sanctuary between my actual home. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs gritty, unpredictable, and can be downright frustrating at times, but it‚Äôs real. And in a city like this, sometimes that‚Äôs the best you can hope for.

Today felt like just another ordinary day.

I work one of those classic office jobs, you know the drill. Beige cubicles, flickering fluorescent lights, and coffee that tastes more like regret than anything remotely caffeinated. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind it. There‚Äôs a certain comfort in the routine. I‚Äôve never been the ‚Äúfollow your passion‚Äù type anyway.

¬†Passion seems like a luxury for those who don‚Äôt have to stress about rent, groceries, or whether their MetroCard has enough balance. For someone like me, a job that asks for exactly what I‚Äôm willing to give. nothing more, nothing less. Feels just right.

So, as usual, I clocked out after a long day, grabbed my well-worn suitcase, more of a work bag, really, but it‚Äôs taken enough hits to deserve the title, and threw on my coat. It was one of those early spring days when the weather can‚Äôt seem to decide what it wants to be. The sky was thick with clouds, but the air felt warm. I remember thinking I might have overdressed. Again.

The subway station was busier than usual. I could feel the day‚Äôs fatigue creeping in as I navigated through clusters of tourists clutching maps like they were trying to conjure a spirit. A group of them had gathered in front of the MetroCard machines, blissfully unaware they were blocking the entire entrance. I muttered an ‚Äúexcuse me,‚Äù knowing it would probably go unheard, and slipped past them with the quiet efficiency of someone who‚Äôs done this dance a thousand times.

I managed to find an empty spot on a bench, next to a guy who clearly was in the same predicament as me, just wanting to go home. He sat slouched over, tie loosened, eyes glazed in that universal post-9-to-5 stare. I pulled out my phone and started scrolling. News, social feeds, the same stream of curated distraction I‚Äôd scrolled through that morning. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Just the hypnotic flicker of blue light against my face.

The station hummed with a low mechanical groan, the kind that seeps into your bones if you stand still long enough. A saxophone echoed faintly from somewhere down the platform, its player hidden behind a row of pillars. The music was slow, mournful, something that might‚Äôve been soulful if not for the flat notes and tinny reverb.

The overhead lights flickered once, briefly, and I felt my eyelids droop. The kind of droop that comes not just from exhaustion, but from routine, bone-deep familiarity with a world that never quite changes. The same gum-stained tiles, the same peeling advertisements promising miracle diets and dubious lawyers, the same stale underground air tinged with hot metal and too many people in too small a space.

I blinked slowly. My phone sagged in my grip. Maybe it was the warmth of the tunnel, or the way the concrete seemed to hum in time with my heartbeat, but a fog started creeping in behind my eyes. A subtle pounding, dull but persistent, started at the base of my skull and worked its way forward. Not quite a migraine yet, but close. That hazy, unreal feeling where everything seems too far away or too close at once.

I shifted on the bench, adjusted the strap of my bag, and tried to focus on something, anything. A child across the platform was swinging his legs, counting tiles. An older woman tapped her cane rhythmically as if keeping time to some internal metronome. The train was late, of course.

My head dipped forward for just a moment. Or at least, I thought it was a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a start, heart thudding, phone sliding from my lap.

I quickly grabbed it before it could fall. My fingers wrapped around the phone just in time, its smooth surface slick with the sweat of my palm. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting my heart settle back into a more reasonable rhythm. The jolt had shaken off the last of my drowsiness, but something else had replaced it, an uneasy stillness. I glanced around, blinking hard.

The station was empty.

Startlingly, unnaturally empty.

The bench beside me, where the tired man had been sitting, was now vacant. The tourists, the child counting tiles, the old woman with the cane,gone. Every single person had vanished. No more quiet chatter, no more shuffling feet. The distant hum of the saxophone had stopped. Even the ever-present whoosh of air from passing tunnels was absent. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and disorienting.

My first thought was that I had fallen asleep for hours and missed the crowds, missed the rush. But that didn‚Äôt explain the silence. The subway never slept, not completely. There was always someone, always noise. Always something.

Confused, I moved to check the time on my phone. The screen stayed black. I pressed the power button once, twice, nothing. No buzz, no flicker. It was like the phone had simply died, or forgotten how to be a phone. I turned it over in my hands, wondering if the battery had given out. But it hadn‚Äôt felt like it was dying before I nodded off. And still‚Ä¶ It felt warm. Too warm.¬†

I sighed, my breath louder than it should‚Äôve been in the silent station, and slowly stood. The sound of my coat shifting, the scuff of my shoe against the platform, all echoed more than they should. My bag tugged at my shoulder as I adjusted it. The concrete underfoot suddenly felt less stable, like I was balancing on something too smooth, too polished to be part of a subway system that was never cleaned enough.

That‚Äôs when I heard it: the distant metallic screech of a train on the tracks, growing louder by the second. I turned toward the tunnel. Headlights cut through the darkness, spilling yellow beams that flickered as they passed over stray bits of trash and the tiled walls.

The train was slowing. Coming to a stop.

The front car hissed as it aligned with the platform, the doors sighing open in a mechanical exhale. I waited for someone to step out. No one did. No conductor visible. No passengers. The interior lights flickered, weak, sickly fluorescents that buzzed like an old ceiling fixture in a basement no one visited anymore.

I hesitated, my instincts buzzing now in a different way, telling me this didn‚Äôt make sense, that I should wait for the next one, that something about this was off. But logic took over. I told myself I‚Äôd simply take this train to my stop. Maybe this was one of those weird off-hours when everything just feels strange. Maybe there had been a power surge, and that‚Äôs why the phone was dead. Maybe I was just tired and overthinking it all.

I stepped closer, boots thudding softly against the concrete as I approached the open doors. They creaked apart slowly, like jaws easing open for a meal. Above the door, the flickering orange letters of the Destination Sign glowed through the gloom:

*‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù*

It scrolled, paused, then repeated.

*‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù*

I squinted at it, confused. The words were unfamiliar, clearly not English, but close enough to make me think I should know them. ‚ÄúSpanish?‚Äù I wondered. ‚ÄúItalian, maybe? Latin?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know. Whatever it was, it didn‚Äôt seem to be a station name, and definitely not one I recognized from the usual route.¬†

I shrugged to myself. I didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, at least, that‚Äôs what I assumed it was ,and besides, it didn‚Äôt matter. I was tired. I was cold. I just wanted to get home.

The doors finished opening with a heavy thunk that echoed down the empty station.

I stepped on.

The moment I crossed the threshold, a strange sensation washed over me, like I‚Äôd walked through a membrane of cold air, colder than the platform, almost like a refrigerated room. A shiver climbed my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me, trying not to look too long at the sterile glow of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Once again, the car was empty. Too empty. Not the lived-in kind of empty, not the kind that follows a morning rush or a late-night lull. This was something else. The seats were spotless, almost clinically so. The air was unmoving, stale but not from use, like it had been trapped in here for too long. Even the hum of the train's systems sounded muted, muffled somehow.

I picked a seat near the middle, my fingers gripping the plastic edge for balance. The cold seeped through my jacket, into my hands, into my bones. I let out a long breath, watching it fog slightly in front of my face.

I sat. I held my bag close.

I told myself this was just a weird delay, an alternate route, an old car maybe, something forgotten in the system but still functional. Nothing to worry about.

But my reflection in the window didn't seem convinced. The glass was too dark, too slow to catch up. I shifted slightly, and it lagged a fraction of a second behind, as though unsure whether to follow me at all.

The doors hissed shut behind me, sealing with an almost ceremonial finality. The train jolted forward, moving into the tunnel. No conductor‚Äôs voice came over the intercom. No rumbling announcement of the next stop.

Just that whisper of motion. That chill in the air.

And that sign, still blinking, still repeating, on the far end of the car:

*‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù*

I sat for a moment, hugging my coat tighter, the chill gnawing at my skin. The rhythmic clatter of the train against the tracks was the only sound now, a dull, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the car. I stared at the floor, at the speckled plastic between my boots, until something caught my eye outside the window.

Movement.

I turned my head slowly.

People.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, or my eyes playing games after the nap and the dim glow of the car. But no, it was unmistakable. Just outside the train, barely feet away, people were walking alongside it.

I gasped and bolted upright, pressing my face closer to the glass. The chill from the window stung my skin. The train hadn‚Äôt stopped ;¬† it was still moving, but so were they. A silent procession, keeping perfect pace. Dozens of them. Maybe more.

They walked not on a platform, but on something else, something dark and indistinct. The backdrop behind them was black, as if the tunnel had dissolved into a void. No walls, no lights, no signs. Just figures moving in lockstep with the train.

They didn‚Äôt look at me. They didn‚Äôt look at anything.

Their expressions were blank. Not peaceful, empty. Eyes open, unfocused. Mouths shut. No signs of communication, no hint that they even knew each other. Some were dressed in business suits, others in t-shirts, nightgowns, and uniforms. A teenager shuffled by wearing a backpack. An old woman in a house robe. A child with no shoes. A man in a soaked parka that dripped even though there was no rain.

No common thread, no reason, just people. All kinds of people.

And they were all walking in the same direction, right beside me, staring forward into nothing.

I felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the seat. I couldn‚Äôt look away. My brain raced to make sense of it. Some kind of art installation? A window to another train? A hallucination?

But they were too close. Too real. I could see the subtle sway of their steps, the twitch of a hand here, a loose thread blowing slightly there.

Finally, I sat back down, the seat creaking softly beneath me. I kept my eyes on the figures outside, watching them pass with that same slow, ghostlike pace. None of them looked back again. They just walked endlessly, obediently, as if drawn by some invisible tether. I don‚Äôt know how long I watched. Minutes? Hours? It felt like time had dissolved into the rhythm of the train and the hush of those blank faces drifting by.

Then, through the grime-streaked glass, a station emerged from the dark.

The train slowed, the brakes letting out a soft hiss like an exhale. The doors opened without a chime or announcement, just a quiet invitation. I stood, hesitating for a second. Then I stepped forward, drawn by something I couldn‚Äôt name. Maybe curiosity. Maybe instinct. Maybe the growing certainty that this was no ordinary ride home.

I clutched my bag tightly and stepped off.

The station was quiet. Too quiet.

Pale lighting flickered above, casting a soft ivory glow over every surface. There was classical music playing faintly, some string piece I couldn‚Äôt name, maybe Debussy or Satie,but it echoed as though it had been playing forever, looping in a forgotten corner of a dream. The acoustics were wrong. A fog dusted the floor, almost like dry ice had been hidden in the corner.¬†

The walls gleamed, tiles white as bone, without a smudge or crack. No stains, no ads torn halfway down, no gum under the benches. Even the trash bins were empty. It wasn‚Äôt just clean,it was sterile, like no one had ever truly been here. Or if they had, they‚Äôd been erased afterward.

And yet‚Ä¶ ads lined the far wall.

Not the usual ones for teeth whitening or discount lawyers. These were photographs, portraits. Faces I half-recognized. Not from life, but from dreams. From forgotten corners of sleep, from memories I could never fully place. One woman looked like a version of my second-grade teacher, but with green eyes and a crown of wheat. Another man reminded me of someone I once saw standing outside my apartment window at 2 a.m., ten years ago. I was certain I‚Äôd never seen these people in waking life, and yet there they were. Smiling. Still. Almost expectant.¬†

The brand names were vague, I wasn‚Äôt even sure if they were English. My eyes couldn‚Äôt focus enough on the logos to take in any details.¬†

Other passengers stood along the platform. At first, I thought they might board. But none of them moved. Some murmured to themselves. Others stood perfectly still, staring into space or fiddling with watches, pendants, and small objects clutched like charms. A few whispered phrases, fragmented riddles that made no sense.

‚ÄúThe river runs backward, and so do the clocks.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe never took the second stair.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more stop, or none at all.‚Äù

Their voices didn‚Äôt carry. It was like they were underwater.

I stepped further in. My shoes made no sound on the tiled floor. No one acknowledged me. No one reacted. I might as well have been a ghost among ghosts. I looked for signs. Exit, Uptown, Transfer, anything. But there was nothing. Just the gleaming walls, the frozen faces, and that low, looping melody.

There were no stairs. No escalators. No elevators. Just this platform. Endless, perfect, and sealed. My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag. The train behind me remained at the platform, doors still open. Waiting.¬† I took a step farther from the train. The lights above flickered faintly, not enough to go dark, just enough to feel like they could. My footsteps made no sound.

I looked around again, slower this time.

A strange pressure began to build in my chest. A low, crawling sense of wrongness. I felt like I was walking too far into something I wouldn't know how to leave. Like the further I got from the train, the less of myself I was carrying with me. Amid the crowd, a face called to me. I froze, staring, heart thudding in my chest as I traced each familiar feature. I knew it was my brother.

But that was impossible.

He‚Äôd died before we ever came to New York.¬†

That fire had taken everything. It caught in the middle of the night, silent and sudden, and by the time help came, it was too late. The cause had never been determined. Just one of those tragedies people nod solemnly about and try to forget.

Our family didn‚Äôt forget. My mom certainly wouldn't. We left.

So how could he be here, now?¬†

I shook my head, trying to clear it, to ground myself in reality. It couldn‚Äôt have been him.

It couldn‚Äôt.

I turned back.

The open doors of the train looked different now, less inviting, more like a wound in the wall. A slit of light in a place that shouldn't have any. I hesitated. Then the whisper of a thought brushed through my mind, not mine, but carried on the edges of instinct:

This is the only way out.

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. Without another glance at the other passengers or the sterile walls, I stepped back onto the train.

As my foot crossed the threshold, a chill rushed over me. Colder than before. Deeper. Like stepping into the memory of winter. I sat down quickly, bag clutched tight in my lap, and tried not to look out the window. The doors slid shut behind me with a slow, deliberate hiss. The train began to move.

And as I settled into my seat again and the train lurched forward, a cold, cutting wind crept into the closed car. It had started as a draft, but only a thin trickle of air which tickled my neck. But it came, bulging in the course of a few moments into a wild, shrieking gust, as if the train had opened its veins to the world. Wind whipped down the aisle, tugging at my coat, messing strands of hair, icy on the sweat glued to my skin.

The wind shouldn't have been that strong. The windows weren‚Äôt open. The train was closed, air-conditioned to perfection like always. But this wind had a presence, there but not seen. I pulled myself into my coat, holding my bag as if it would ground me. Then, under the shriek of air, I heard something else. A whisper. But unmistakable.

It was my name.

I sat upright, my heart pounding in my chest. The whisper came again, so low I could barely pick it out, but as distinct as my thoughts. My name, sung through like an echo of a tunnel, spoken not with cruelty but with hunger.¬†

I looked around at the car, still empty. Quiet still, other than the wind and the pounding rhythm of the beat of my heart. Lights above flashed. Not loosely, electrically. But on purpose. As if the train itself was trembling. And then there was the deceleration of momentum. Slowly slowing down, passing on of inertia, the gentle pull in my stomach. The train was slowing once again.

Forward, the darkness broke apart to let in light. Not sterile white of a sanitized station. Not even the pale light of industrial halogens. This was rich, red light, alive, pulsating as if it were imbued with its heartbeat. It poured in through the windows in heavy waves, cloaking the inside of the train in a cave of crimson.

I stood up involuntarily, as if my body had decided something by itself. My legs pulled me toward the door, forced by some energy that did not entirely feel mine. The train came to a stop, and the doors slid open softly.

It wasn't a platform that stood there.¬†

In its stead, a nightclub spread out like an underground cave. Black marble-lined walls glowed with crimson veins of neon. The floor shone beneath your feet like melted glass. Each surface caught the light in unnerving, twisted fashions, as though the room was shifting, reforming itself constantly to remain just this side of graspable.

And the music, deep, beaty, sensual, thrashed in the air. It wasn't brash. It didn't have to be. It shook in your bones, slower than a beat but closer. As if the beat had always been in you, and now the world is mirroring it.

Bodies moved in the room, dancing stiffly with elegance. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. Each of them chiseled like a dream or a Vogue cover, but wrong in a way I couldn't understand. Their faces were smooth and expressionless, like porcelain masks with a forever grin. Eyes black and impossible deep. Their movement was hypnotic, smooth, as if they weren't dancing to the music but were the music. And most strangely, they were all naked.¬†

A stench of scent hit me. Perfume so potent it was bordering on rotten, the astringent tang of sweat, and something below that, metallic and irrevocable. Iron. I gagged, the smell remaining on the back of my throat like blood. And then the voices. Whispers in a dozen different timbres, interweaving the bass, curling around my ears like smoke.

""Come in,"" they whispered.

""We've been waiting.""

""You've always fantasized about this.""

""We know what you want.""

I ached to run. I ached to turn back. But my feet stayed rooted just beyond the train, drawn to heat, rhythm, weight of the air. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. One of the riders. A man I'd not even noticed until now. How did I not see him?¬†

He stood up from a bench on the inside of the train. A young man, dressed in business clothes, his tie loose, his eyes opened wide with awe. He spoke not a word, fought not. He simply walked ahead, moving as slowly as a somnambulist. He stepped off the train and onto the glowing dance floor.

The dancers shifted without missing a beat. They didn't stop, didn't blink. They shifted, making space for him with an inhuman fluidity. They found him, every one of them, and he stood still in the middle of their circle.

He stopped. Then smiled. Not a happy smile. Not even a relief smile. It was empty. Like something inside him had been removed. The dancers closed in around him. And I heard the scream.

It didn't come from the crowd. It came from the wall.

I approached the noise and saw an enormous mirror hung on a gold frame, radiating faintly with the same red light that filled the room. And within this mirror, the young man was pushed up against the glass from within. His mouth was agape, screaming, but he was making no sound. His hands clawed the glass. His eyes were wild, desperate, frightened. The scene behind him was chaos. A twisted, true version of the lounge beyond the flashy red lights. The other patrons inside the mirror were screaming, thrown about by invisible winds. Everything within that reflection was warped, violent, and wrong.

Behind him, the dancers moved in step. As if nothing had occurred. As if he had never lived at all. The mirror pulsed. The whispers returned, louder now, piling and insisting:

*""You don't choose what you want.""*

*""The want chooses you.""*

I stepped back. My boot caught on the lip of the train door. The dancers adjusted in my direction,just a little. Just enough. Enough for me. I launched myself back aboard the train. My breath caught as the doors slammed shut. The train groaned and began to move again, dragging me from the red light, from the mirror, from the scream that still echoed inside my chest.

I fell into the chair, my heart pounding.

The gust of wind returned, almost soft. The way fingers combed my hair.

But the scent lingered. Perfume. Sweat. Iron.

I was disoriented and immensely confused. Where the hell was I?

This had to be a dream. Some kind of break from reality. A crack in the smooth surface of sanity. I‚Äôd read about astral projection before, back when I was dabbling in all that witchy stuff. crystals, herbs, and protection spells. I‚Äôd gotten into it for a while after I first moved to New York, just enough to recognize the signs. That had to be what this was. A lucid dream. Maybe an episode. Something my brain was doing to cope. I had to be under too much pressure.

Everything had been unraveling lately. Bills are piling up. The weird tension between me and everyone I cared about. And with the third anniversary of my mom‚Äôs suicide coming up next week... maybe that was the trigger. Grief had a way of slipping back into your life like smoke under a door, unnoticed until you couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I looked around, trying to orient myself. Fluorescent lights buzzed above me like angry insects. The walls of the subway car pulsed in a dull, metallic gray, a sterile cage on wheels. I pinched my skin hard. Nothing. So I slapped myself across the face. The sound cracked the silence, and my cheek flushed pink where the impact landed. It didn‚Äôt hurt, exactly. More like a shimmer, a tingle. Almost like when a limb falls asleep, pins and needles, but warmer. Buzzing, alive.

When returning to your body after astral projection, you usually just find your resting place and slip back in. But I didn‚Äôt feel like a floating soul. I felt dense. Solid. The seat under me was hard. The air tasted faintly of rust and electricity. My skin felt too real, too intact. Could you still feel your heartbeat during astral projection?

I stared at my hands, no glow, no transparency. Just flesh and bone and chipped nail polish. I flexed my fingers. Still me. Still trapped. Maybe if I stayed on this train, let it take me wherever it was going, I‚Äôd find my way back. The idea felt like a rope I could hold onto. So I held onto it. I chose to believe it.

I leaned back into the seat. The clack-clack-clack of the wheels echoed in my ears, the sound oddly soothing. Outside the window, tunnels rushed past in flickers of shadow and gold, overhead lights strobing through the darkness like nervous thoughts. The rhythm of the train pressed itself into my bones, the gentle sway creating an almost meditative lull. Almost peaceful.

The next stop came into view.

I leaned toward the window, squinting into the strange light ahead. It wasn‚Äôt a station. It was a food court. The train slowed, the rhythmic clacking becoming a groaning crawl. I felt the brakes shudder beneath me, and once again, as they had before, the doors slid open with that same exhale of air, mechanical and tired.

The food court stretched out around me, impossibly wide, far larger than it could be. It curved in on itself in strange, repeating angles, like I‚Äôd stepped into a place that had forgotten how to end. Everywhere I turned, the same pale tiles, the same buzzing lights overhead. The hum in the air wasn‚Äôt just sound; it was pressure, like the building was breathing around me. Holding something in.

The counters were still stocked. Endlessly, violently stocked. Trays of meat were piled high, slick with a sheen that caught the light too well. Some pieces pulsed faintly, as if remembering what it was to live. There were pastries, too many, bursting at their seams with gelatinous fillings that leaked in slow, sticky drips down their sides. The smell was sugar and rot, warm and sickly sweet. They looked like they‚Äôd been decaying for days, and yet were always just set out.

And then there was the sludge. Piles of it in steel trays, bubbling softly. Brown, green, gray, none of it resembling food. It steamed endlessly, like it was being cooked by the building itself. The ladles stood stiff in the mounds, handles glistening, untouched but never quite clean. Every time I looked away and back again, the trays had been refilled. Nothing was ever gone. Nothing ever changed.

Except for them.

The patrons.

They were scattered across the tables, if you could call them people. Bloated, distended, half-fused to their chairs. Some looked stretched thin, like their skin had forgotten how to hold shape. Others had grown around the metal frames, flesh bulging between the bars of their seats like rising dough. Their eyes were cloudy, mouths slack. One man chewed endlessly at something I couldn‚Äôt see. A woman held a fork midair, never lifting it to her mouth, never lowering it. Just frozen in the act. Like they were all trapped in some looping performance of hunger.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if they were alive. I told myself not to look too long. But I did. One turned toward me. Just slightly. The skin at her neck cracked when she moved. Then, she returned to eating.¬†

The lights overhead buzzed louder. The menus on the stalls flickered, showing food that didn‚Äôt exist. A cheeseburger with teeth. A milkshake that twitched. I kept walking, trying to find an edge, an exit, even a dead end. But the layout looped, warped. Every turn brought me back to the same corner. The sludge. The meat. The figures are in their seats.

‚ÄúFree me,‚Äù a voice called.

That stopped me in my tracks, the first human voice I‚Äôd heard since I boarded the train. A man slumped in a steel chair, grotesque and bloated. His flesh spilled over the sides like melted wax, glistening with sweat. His face, barely recognizable as human, quivered as he sobbed, yet his hands kept working, shoveling gray, unidentifiable slop from a tray into his mouth. Like he had no choice.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, stepping closer. My voice sounded small, unsure. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he rasped, not looking at me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it anymore.‚Äù

Suddenly, a speaker overhead crackled to life, sharp and cold.¬†*‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù*¬†The words echoed through the food court, sterile and inhuman.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said, but I didn‚Äôt know what I meant. I was sorry he was like this. I was sorry I couldn‚Äôt help. I was sorry I had come. He turned his swollen face toward me. For a moment, something real flickered in his eyes. ‚ÄúI just want to go home,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt was too soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was?‚Äù I asked. He opened his mouth, as if to answer, but the announcement cut in again.¬†*‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù*

The effect was instant. Like a switch had been flipped. The man turned away. His expression went slack. The tears stopped. The shoveling resumed, mechanical and precise. The hunger was still there, but it no longer belonged to him. I stood frozen, heart pounding, watching him eat. His eyes no longer saw me. He was already gone.¬†

I turned to head back to the train when a terrible scream tore through the air behind me. It wasn‚Äôt just loud, it was raw, like something being ripped apart from the inside out.

I spun around. The sound came from the woman, the one who had looked at me earlier. Her eyes were wide, wild with terror. Her body jerked violently as she was dragged backward, not by hands or machinery, but by something invisible. There were no ropes, no figures. Just an unseen force pulling her toward a dark doorway at the back of the food court.

She screamed all the way in. Then, silence. Moments passed. Just when I thought I might step forward, she reappeared.

She walked slowly, mechanically, and sat back down in her seat as if nothing had happened. But she looked‚Ä¶ smaller. The grotesque layers of flesh she‚Äôd worn before were mostly gone now, stripped away as if something had peeled her like fruit. Her eyes were hollow. Her limbs moved like they were no longer hers.

As soon as she sat, more trays of slop were delivered across the food court. The other patrons began to eat again, more eagerly now, like she had somehow replenished them. It hit me all at once: she had. She‚Äôd been used. Fed into whatever machine powered this place, only to be returned diminished, but not free. Never free.

I backed away slowly, the air feeling heavier with each breath. Then I turned and stepped back onto the train. As the doors sealed behind me, I cast one last glance at the food court. I felt something close to pity for the patrons, the sad, swollen husks that slumped in their chairs, but the feeling rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt people anymore. They couldn‚Äôt be. Whatever they had been was long gone.

This whole cycle, getting off at these stops, walking through the corridors, watching things fall apart, it all seemed strange now. Pointless. Like I was just one more cog in something ancient and uncaring. I sank into my seat, eyes forward, letting the soft rattle of the train lull me into stillness. The lights flickered overhead. The wheels groaned.¬†

I know a lot of you are missing that special person or in need of some compassion for your situation or circumstance, but if we get what we give, it‚Äôs important to ask yourself. 

Am I giving that which I want to receive?  Also, if you had that which you want, how would you act?  What would you be doing? What would you be putting out into the world?  I find the best way to get things you want is to give it to others first and then it will come back to you even more. 

Also guys with God you always get double what you lose. So if you have lost something and you believe and create with God you will get back more then you lost. Anytime I lost and I turned to my faith and God to right the wrongs I always got more then I lost. 

Also. I know at first when we begin manifesting and it does start to work we get a lot of things we don‚Äôt care about or need or really desire. We can sometimes get discouraged when the main desire doesn‚Äôt manifest and it‚Äôs easy to get a new bad story like I did. I once believed God won‚Äôt give me what I want so he gives me all these consolation prizes. Like here. To make up for not getting your person. Sometimes it‚Äôs big things we also needed like money. A lot of it too. I started to believe that was my blessing to say sorry you don‚Äôt get her but you get this. 

That‚Äôs just dumb. Why would God show you he is not only real but working with you and blessing you but then not give you your hearts desire?  He wouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs showing you that it‚Äôs all possible. They it‚Äôs so easy to turn around when you leave it to him. Also these desires we have are not as big of a deal as we think they are. It‚Äôs our fear that makes them seem unattainable. But remember. You‚Äôve had the sp before. It wasn‚Äôt a challenge. You‚Äôve had money before. It‚Äôs come back to you. Your relationship and being one with God is the most important thing you will do on this earth. Make that your life‚Äôs mission and watch how all the other stuff comes easily. When you drink from Gods well you‚Äôll never be thirsty again. That hole you are trying to fill with another‚Äôs love or money or whatever can only be filled by God and once it is, you‚Äôll never want again. 

In order to get your desire you MUST BELIEVE. WHAT BETTER WSY TO SHOW YOU BELIEVE THEN TO GET A CHANCE TO SHOW YOURSELF THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU DON‚ÄôT YET HAVE IT. Like when you pray for courage and God gives you a situation that requires courage so you can see you already have it, when you need to show belief wouldn‚Äôt God help you see that even if it‚Äôs not there yet that when you choose to ignore the 3-d and don‚Äôt take no for an answer and claim God always gives it you and never leaves you without any proof it allows you to prove to yourself that you are now a believer!!!  Once you feel that you are the sabbath washes over you and you are calm and ready to receive and it rushes to your door. The irony is once you believe you start moving forward again and suddenly don‚Äôt worry about it because you know IT‚ÄôS WAITING FOR YOU AT HOME. 

YOU‚ÄôLL KNOW WHEN YOU ARE IN THE SABBATH. ITS A FEELING THAT NEVER FADES AND GROWS STRONGER THEN YOU GET THE DEISRE AND IT STAYS. 

Your job is to believe until it shows. And I mean believe it‚Äôs yours before you have it and you do not waiver  EVER. 

Ok guys. I felt moved to share this info and to remind you if you manifest anything it‚Äôs proof you will get your ultimate desire with belief. Btw if you believe your desires are easy to get then they are. It‚Äôs why I said and so did my people I coached that the sp. The money was easier than a free cup of coffee. The coffee took longer because I hadn‚Äôt yet built my belief but once I did and didn‚Äôt waiver it was done so fast. 

Remember this isn‚Äôt a quick fix UNTIL you learnt it and have your belief. Once you do though you can face any situation and understand it‚Äôs really just a chance to become closer to God and it‚Äôs not really something bad happening to you. 

Ok guys. God bless!

**Title:** Woke up to my crows screaming at me through my window at 5am, was mad but turned out they wanted my help

Fast forward to me scaling a fence to wrangle a feisty little cat that was menacing my crows.

I feed my crows on my apartment patio, which is about 10 feet off the ground and overlooks an enclosed gravel parking lot for a nearby business. My crows can perch on my fence and see me through my window. This morning at 5:30 am they started absolutely screeching at me through the window, which they have never done before. I just got back from a camping trip so I thought they were mad I had been gone.

I went out there to be like, ""it is too early to be yelling for snacks!!"" Everyone was still screeching and I'm mad cause it's cold and I'm half asleep, so I go to toss the kibble into the parking lot instead of putting it on the railing so they'll move away from my apartment. That's when I see the cat.

Like duh, of course they were mad about something. Well the cat didn't look very old and was stuck in the parking area (it's fully fenced in and locked) and obviously a danger to birds. So I got dressed and went to get it.

Man, what an adventure. It took me 30 minutes to catch this damn cat. Not because it was scared of me but because it was having way too much fun terrorizing the birds and making me chase it. Plus I had to climb the fence to get it and then climb back over with the cat (I wrapped it tightly in my hoodie). At least there weren't a lot of people out to witness me pspspspspspspspsing and swearing for 30 min in the early hours.

My crows followed us around the whole time and kept showing me where the cat was when it would run away so I could go catch it lol. At one point the cat was rolling around on a roof shed and all these birds were perched in the tree above it screaming, and I swear this cat was eating it up.

Anyways, I finally managed to get the sneak wrapped in my hoodie and it's now resting safely in my puppies crate until I can find the owner etc. (already working on that part). I have two big dogs and a 560 square foot apartment so kitty is not staying here. Though my older dog is OBSESSED with this cat. She is just laying next to the crate staring at it.

I hope my crows are grateful because waking up at 5:30 am, climbing into a locked fenced area, and wrangling a sneaky juvenile cat in order to protect my crows was not on my list of things I wanted to do this morning.

**Update (Same Post): 1 hour later**

UPDATE: Kitty is back with owner, an older woman in the neighborhood who told me that kitty, ""is an indoor/outdoor cat and she has a lot of freedom."" I let her know that I apprehended her because ""the birds I regularly feed were very upset/going after the cat"" and reminded her that outdoor cats are a danger to birds. Probably won't change anything, but at least I told her.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I'm having a shadenfraude moment and chuckling away over here. Thanks for painting the vivid mental image.... The cat rolling around lapping it up sent me üòÇ

>**OOP:** I thought in the moment, man this would be a hilarious photo. But I was too mad and preoccupied hahaha. Will post a photo of the offending kitty though once I have a good one. It's in the back corner of the crate resting now. All in all a very cute cat. But a wile one!!

Commenter: üòÇüòÇüòÇ i literally ran out my house and over my neighbour‚Äôs fence this morning to save a fledgling starling from a cat (UK, starlings are native)!!! I didn‚Äôt even have my bra on! I came running out with my water gun but after getting over the fence I realised it was taller on the other side and I had to walk round the estate (block?) to get back home üòÇ fledgling was all good! üòÆ‚Äçüí®

>**OOP:** Yes!!!! Bird rescuers unite! I ran out on my patio in my boxers so can relate ü§£. Yay for you and that fledgling!

Commenter: Look at us go!!! I hope we get the opportunity to save many more wee beasts!

>**OOP:** We'll be on the look out for sure!! We're like a vigilante team and our uniform is not-dressed-enough-to-be-rescuing-critters. Our crime fighting spans continents and oceans!! (I'm in the US lol).  
ETA: will be buying a water gun as well so I can be fully prepared! The only acceptable gun for a vigilante crew (or really anyone) to carry regularly.

Commenter: What an amazing bond you guys have. You‚Äôre so in tune with them and I find that extremely wonderful.

>**OOP:** It was pretty cool that they asked for my help! I've been feeding crows for about two years now and I see crows everywhere I go. I feed them whenever I see them/have a snack available and I think many of the crows in the area at least know of me haha. I have two big dogs and live in an apartment so we go on at least three walks a day, which means we're out and about a lot with crow treats. They also come hang out with me on my patio. Crows are so cool! I love them.

Commenter: If you have to save it again, tell its owner it was trapped in an area with no escape, food or water, and embellish a bit that you were worried it would DIE where it got stuck and that the birds seemed to be TRYING TO EAT ITS EYES. Maybe a bit of fear for her ""outdoor cat"" would help it become an indoor cat...

>**OOP:** Oh for sure. If I have another encounter with this cat/owner I am hamming up the danger to the cat because she definitely didn't seem concerned about the bird population. I didn't even mention they were crows! I thought an older lady would understand being concerned about little birds being fed, but alas, she was not.

Commenter: I wouldn't mean crows. Plenty of stupid people already don't like them. No need to have her meds with them to 'protect' her cat. I would point out you've seen rodent pellets out, and her cat can die from catching/eating a poisoned mouse.¬†

>**OOP:** Oh I would not mention the crows as I know that most people don't realize that they are smarter than most pets and have no appreciation (idiots) for their beauty and perfection.  
I would likely mention eagles, falcons, ospreys etc. as we have tons of much more dangerous predator birds in this area that really could hurt her cat.  
ETA: the rodent traps/pellets are a good idea! There are plenty of traps around so it would be an honest warning!

*Crows and OOP's dogs:*

I was really surprised at first because my crows and dogs tolerate each other really well. I used to live in a home with a fenced in backyard and my crow family trusted my older dog with their fledglings. They would let them bop around in the yard even when my dog was out.

I have worked very intentionally though to train my dog not to chase crows and give fledglings their distance. The main things she chases are squirrels and raccoons and the crows, I think, appreciate her for that. Every now and then a crow would startle or move really fast and her natural instincts take over and she jumps up and acts like she's going to chase. But then she catches herself and stops haha.

Now I live in a new place and have a new puppy who is learning to be friends with crows too! I usually put my crow snacks in the potted plants on my patio and then also on the railing. The other day my puppy was out on the patio with the crow when it was trying to eat and Gregor (my puppy) kept getting into the planter the crow was going for. So he flew to the other end of the patio, knocked some treats off the railing onto the patio ground, waited for Gregor to notice and come bumbling over, and then went and got the planter treats while puppy was distracted. Genius.

Now I put all their treats on the railing so my silly puppy doesn't steal them.

But the short version is, my dogs and crows get along great! My crows regularly fly down right next to my dogs to get treats. My puppy alerted me to a nearby crow today before I even noticed and it was only a couple feet away on the ground.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowbro/comments/1kv6uvf/update_saved_my_crows_from_a_cat_now_im_famous/)**: May 25, 2025 (4 days later)**

**Title:** Update: Saved my crows from a cat now I'm famous with all the local crows.

A couple days ago I posted a story about my crows asking for help dealing with a menacing cat. I handled the situation with poise and definitely did not rip the seat of my pants on a chainlink fence.

You can read the original post here,¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/crowbro/s/9DtaimSuKc.

Everywhere I go lately crows show up and say hi.

Driving my car? They swoop down in front of my windshield. They fly by my window.

Walking my dogs? They follow us and hang out on nearby perches when we stop.

Drove 20 minutes to my parent's house? A murder of 20 was waiting for me in the trees and it really did sound like they were talking about me. Within a couple minutes there were 50 üòÇ.

My main bro? Says hi to me every chance he gets. He's the one who alerted me to the cat in the first place. I've never named him because it feels weird to name a wild thing, he probably already has a name! But maybe I should call him something. Open to suggestions. He makes this crazy ""whah whah"" sound I've never heard another crow make.

It's pretty fun being famous with my city crows. I bop around town a lot, so I'm making lots of new crow friends. It's very cool how they can tell each other about someone. I feel like the local crow hero and I'm down for it. Does your murder need protecting? Be there in a min.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Maybe that ""Whah, Whah"" sound is your new name in Crow Speak.

>**OOP:** Shut up, I'm crying.¬†[Here](https://imgur.com/a/GGTG4wQ)'s a sound clip of him.

Commenter: I've never heard a crow make that sound :0 sounds almost like a ringtone

>**OOP:** It's insane! The first time I heard it I was like, ""wtf was that?"" And then I watched the sound come out of his beak and was even more like, ""WTF WAS THAT??""

Commenter: Wallow is what I hear from your video, and I think that‚Äôs a super cool name for a crowbro

Also congrats on your celebrity status. I wonder if other crows will recruit you for side quests now?

>**OOP:** I actually love Wallow. Side quests are my jam, I am 100% open for recruitment for any crow needs.

Commenter: That sounds a little like ‚Äúwah-woah‚Äù - it could also be him trying to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù.¬†

‚Ä¶do you ever say ‚Äúhello‚Äù to him?

>**OOP:** I do! But he did not learn it from me. He made that sound at me a couple times after our first interaction and I don't say hello in any tones that sound like his.  
Very possible he learned it from someone else or is copying people he's heard and used it with me to say hello. That's what makes sense to me and was my initial thought the first time I heard him say it.

Commenter: The flex I need, you have. I wanna be a crow bro.

>**OOP:** You've got this! I've started from 0 with feeding crows twice now because I had to move suddenly and left my original murder behind.  
What works best for me is to go on a walk around town with a bag of peanuts. Every single time I hear or see a crow (whether I think they have seen me or not) I toss out some peanuts. The first couple walks you may not get any to come down at all. Don't give up! Patience and continuity are key.  
When you have your first crow come down for peanuts, then you can start putting out peanuts at home. They will follow you and find your home and then they will visit your home.  
In my experience, going to them first works much better than waiting for them to come to you. They want to see they can trust you and that you'll make an effort before they'll try peanuts you left out at home. What if those are poisoned?? What if it's a trap??  
Also for the first several weeks keep your eyes and face averted. They don't want you to make eye contact until you've got an established relationship. But when you get there, so good! Nothing like looking a crow in the eyes and it looking right back at you.

Commenter: This makes me want to be famous with crows. Think about the possibilities! I would travel the country just making friends with crows in every city, become a legend. You should do that. Let‚Äôs raise an army, start a cult, etc. üòÇ

>**OOP:** Yesssss Crow Cult has such a good ring to it. Murder Posse? So many options.  
But really, I do make every effort to befriend crows everywhere I go. I once backtracked on a bike ride so I could open a bag of chips two crows were trying to peck a whole in. Dumped out the crisps for them, threw away the bag. Win win!

Commenter: I recently read somewhere (I can't find the original post) that this sound if I remember correctly is actually a new trend that has very quickly spread across the country for crows. I wish I could find the original post I seen about this it was incredibly interesting.

>**OOP:** Oh wow! That would be so cool. If you do find it send it my way. I wonder if its purpose is connecting with humans. They're like, ""Hey, try this new slang with humans! They fucking shit their pants over it! So many treats!""

Commenter: My niece is convinced that Crows remember every misdeed against them and every loving gesture. She will be thrilled by this story!

>**OOP:** But they do!! It's been scientifically proven. Show her¬†[this](https://urban.uw.edu/news/crows-hold-grudges-against-individual-humans-for-up-to-17-years/)¬†study if she hasn't seen it yet. They have to keep changing the number of years because the crows just keep remembering. There's no telling how long they'll remember because now it's clear that they communicate about people to other crows and their offspring, so grudges span generations.  
Basically, fuck around and find out.

Commenter: If I may ask, how did you come by the knowledge of concealing your face and averting your eyes during the first few weeks?¬† If it was merely by intuition, or close observation, I think I may need to hang you with the title of ""The Crow Whisperer"".

>**OOP:** Ok this is so random. But it was a combination of intuition and the movie Nope. Not making eye contact with a wild creature is a key aspect of that movie (based on real evidence from nature) and when I was interacting with my crows I realized that they did not like it when I looked directly at them. So I just tried not looking at them and they would let me get so much closer.  
I built up trust with them by watching them from a distance or inside my house/apartment. They mind that less. Then slowly looking at them from the corner of my eye (they know you're watching them). Sometimes it takes months, but if you really give it a go and are slow and patient the reward is fantastic.

**Mini Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowbro/comments/1kx00pg/wag_wah_and_his_mate_saying_a_close_hello_also/) **2: May 27, 2025 (2 days later)**

**Title:** Wag Wah and his mate saying a close hello, also making sure the other crows know I've been claimed

*Video available for view in the post link*

Here's my main bro, calling him Wah Wah and Wallow after everyone gave suggestions for his nickname, and his mate. Mate is in the tree on the left and Wallow is hanging out on the right supervising. See my post history if you want more backstory.

While I was out on my walk with my dogs today, just before the tree hellos, a different crow came along with a treat in its beak and showed it off to me like, ""hey you got treats? I like them, you could feed me too!"" Unfortunately I did not have any crow treats with me at the time. Slacking, I know.

As soon as I started talking to this crow, Wallow comes out of nowhere and tackles them, knocks them on their back, and just lays into them. The other crow was fine, flew away a second later. I have to say I cracked up. Not the first time Wallow has kept crows away from me, but usually he's only territorial about my patio. Seems like he's upping the anti. üòÇ

Once the other crow was dealt with, Wallow and his mate flew in and perched on these two trees within feet of me. The video is not zoomed in, they were both within an arms reach, the closest they have chosen to get yet. We had a nice little chat and then my dogs and I went on our way. After promising further treats at home of course.

The second part of the video is Wallow on my porch strutting around on the railing. He just had his treats and is feeling pretty good about himself for claiming his territory.

I've been wondering why I only get one or two crows on my patio for a hot minute. Definitely confirmed it today that Wallow is keeping them away üòÜ. He and his mate are the only ones allowed, and he only brings his mate when he's feeling it.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowbro/comments/1l1nh4e/update_the_cat_is_back_this_time_my_crowbro/) **3: June 2, 2025 (5 days later, 12 from OG post)**

**Title:** update: THE CAT IS BACK. This time my crowbro helped me catch her.

TLDR: I saved my crows from a cat and became the neighborhood crow hero. Got my second call for duty today ü´°. Same fucking cat.

So I was on a walk with my dogs this morning when I hear a crow alarm going off in one of the trees ahead. I bustled my dogs along to see what was up, because if I can help obviously I'm going to. Bro was flapping around this tree screeching about something, which is when I realized it was my guy, Wallow. I looked up in the branches to see what was going on and it's that damn cat again.

All I had with me was my wallet so I tried throwing it at her to get her to come down. I'm not afraid to climb a tree (really I will climb a tree for fun) but this one would be difficult and it's on the grounds of a middle school. The last thing I need is to embarrass myself by falling out of a tree next to a middle school I walk by every day. Well I missed a bunch with my wallet and she didn't give a shit so, time to reconsider.

At first I thought it might be a different cat because it was wearing a different color collar and there have been signs up for a lost cat that looks similar. So I ran back to the local dog store (just up the street) to see if I could find the ""Lost Cat"" sign I had seen before. The sign was gone. Thus, I figured little miss kitty had to be a repeat offender.

I took my dogs home and went back out to check on the cat situation. Figured I might as well see if there was anything I could do. My bro (wah wah or Wallow is his nickname but I mostly just say ""hey friend"" to him), was sitting on the roof of the middle school a ways away keeping on eye on things. I couldn't see the cat anymore so I circled the tree looking for it, but no such luck.

I thought maybe she had left already so I turned to leave and that's when Wallow came flying down from his perch all fluffed up ready to go talons out. Kitty was just hiding further up where I couldn't see her. He got this cat so good she ran out of the tree terrified and I was able to grab her. So now I have a sidekick (Wallow not the cat).

Sally is the cat's name and she has a new collar with her owners phone number on it. I carried her back to my apartment in the embarrassing¬†*ass hanging free*¬†position that Wallow enjoyed so much last time and he divebombed us the whole way back to my apartment shrieking swear words at Sally. She was definitely scared.

Wallow got extra kibble today as a thank you for the assist. And Sally's owner got a voicemail explaining how her cat was in danger from large predatory birds that kept divebombing her (wouldn't tell her they were crows in a million years) and that she may want to reconsider having her cat outdoors.

Cat's in jail (my puppy's crate) for now. She definitely remembered me and I think wanted to be saved? Because there were a lot of birds harassing her in that tree. Not just crows haha.

And yet again I have dealt with little miss Sally before even having my first cup of coffee. So I'm gonna go do that while I wait for a callback from Sally's owner.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

*OOP explains:*

>I'm not trapping her pet. The cat was in danger, my crow literally knocked it out of a tree and the cat came running straight for me and willingly jumped into my arms. I called her owner the second I got her to safety and have already arranged for her to be picked up.  
ETA: I ham up the anti-cat in this story because it's for the crowbros. Obviously little miss Sally's safety is important to me as well and I only embarrassed her for a little while

Commenter: I hope the embarrassment of having your cat handed back a second time + a scared cat will put some sense in the owner.

>**OOP:** One can hope! Doubtful though she texted me back asking me to just let the cat out because she just got out of surgery and can't pick her up. I made sure to be very clear that she was knocked out of a tree by a large bird and was then divebombed repeatedly, but she didn't respond to that part. I felt so awful but I don't know where she lives and felt it would be too weird to ask, so Sally is out and about again. Owner is expecting her and said she would keep an eye out.  
She's an elderly lady who I guess just doesn't see a problem with having an indoor/outdoor cat. I'll probably have repeated run ins with Sally now. I put her owner's number in my phone lol.

Commenter: What a terrible update. Should‚Äôve just let it ‚Äúout‚Äù to a shelter without the collar.

>**OOP:** She's a little old lady who just got out of surgery. I'm not going to go against her request for her cat. It's not illegal to have outdoor cats but I'm guessing it is illegal to intentionally make it more difficult for someone to get their animal back. Did my best with a shitty situation ü§∑üèº.

Commenter: But you can bring the cat to a non-kill shelter to get the cat out of a shitty situation.

>**OOP:** And they will literally call the number on the collar and give the cat back to her owner.

Commenter (downvoted): A) Don't have to bring the collar.

B) That would still get the point across to them, hopefully getting a call from a shelter would make thing realize ""I'm being stupid""

>**OOP:** I may be a bit of a vigilante, but I'm not committing fraud. Taking her collar off and pretending I just found her on the street and don't know the owner potentially resulting in the cat not going home to an owner who is at least taking steps to keep an eye on her and is also a little old lady is a level I will not stoop to.",43,1749441844.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,8,0.94,False

1l6vdc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l6vdc4/there_was_never_a_dog/,There was never a dog.,"I was driving home, it was a normal day. I get off work at 7 p.m. every day and live only five minutes away, so I‚Äôm usually walking through my front door by 7:05. The weekends are different. Instead of going home and sleeping, I go home, change, then go pick up my daughter at daycare. And today was the weekend, my daughter was in the backseat. She was talking, like she always did, about her day at daycare‚Äîher friends, the playground, everything. I barely listened. Not because I didn‚Äôt care, but because I was just so damn tired. Every time I leave work, I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart. I can barely stay awake. That‚Äôs why I chose this apartment‚Äîjust five minutes from my job. I get home, crash, and sleep.

‚ÄúThere was a ladybug today at the playground! My friend Jermey let me play with his Hot Wheels! I got to pet a cute dog!‚Äù Delilah said excitedly.

‚ÄúUhuh. Yeah. That‚Äôs nice,‚Äù I mumbled, half-asleep behind the wheel. Over and over, like a broken record.

That was the first time she mentioned the dog. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But after that, she wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about it. Every ride, every weekend, she‚Äôd bring it up again‚Äîthis ‚Äúdog‚Äù she saw and would pet. She‚Äôd go on and on about it, telling me I should come see it.  
‚ÄúDaddy! You should visit the dog someday! Come on, see it!. I never liked dogs, I‚Äôll admit. They always unsettled me. I‚Äôm not sure why. Maybe it‚Äôs something about their instincts, something I don‚Äôt fully understand. Or maybe it‚Äôs from some old, buried trauma I‚Äôve never really faced. I‚Äôve always preferred cats. So of course, I‚Äôd just nod and say, ‚ÄúSome day, Delilah.‚Äù But deep down, I knew that day would never come. I could never bring myself to go near that dog.

One day, after working a double shift, I didn‚Äôt get home until around 9 p.m. I was completely drained‚Äîbarely able to keep my eyes open, let alone find the energy to play with my daughter. It was nearly her bedtime anyway. Still, I picked her up from daycare and started the short drive home. Delilah was cheerful as ever, chatting from the backseat about her day‚Äîmore stories from the playground, more excitement than I could process in my half-asleep haze.  
  
‚ÄúUhuh‚Ä¶‚Äù was all I could manage. I was just so tired.

But then, through the fog of exhaustion, something she said cut through.

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù she said softly, almost like it was a secret, ‚Äúthe dog followed you home today.‚Äù

I blinked and glanced up at the rearview mirror, meeting her eyes.

**‚ÄúHe was under your car,‚Äù** she added, her voice calm. **‚ÄúHe was watching us drive.‚Äù**

Strange, I thought‚Äîbut that couldn‚Äôt be right. When I left work, I didn‚Äôt see any dogs.  
The roads were empty. Then it hit me: Delilah had been at daycare all day. She wasn‚Äôt with me.  
So how could she have seen a dog following me? I brushed it off as a kid just making up stories for attention, and went on with the day.

By morning, it was Monday. Her mom always picks her up before I head to work, so she was already gone by the time I got back. My apartment felt too quiet.I missed my daughter, living with her full-time. But her mother and I just couldn‚Äôt make things work. Too many arguments. Too much distance. Still, I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîsometimes I envied my life before I became a father. The freedom. The extra income. The quiet.  
But I loved Delilah. That was never in question. I often had to fight just to get more days with her‚Äîmore time to hold onto something good. It makes me feel sick to even think it.  
How could I feel that way when all she ever did was love me?

The week passed by as usual. Nothing strange, nothing out of the ordinary. I was just looking forward to the weekend‚Äîlooking forward to seeing my daughter again. By Friday, I was too tired to think. Just counting the hours. But something was off. Normally, I come home, collapse on the couch, and fall asleep without thinking. But that night, I felt‚Ä¶ *restless.* Not alert, not awake‚Äîjust unable to settle. Like something was buzzing beneath my skin.

So I decided to keep myself busy. Chores, anything to fill the silence. I stepped outside to take out the trash. It was already dark. The air was cold and damp, thick in that way that makes even familiar places feel eerie, distorted‚Äîlike the world had gone just a little sideways. I walked slowly with the bag, lifted the lid of the trash bin with one hand, ready to toss it in‚Äî  
When I heard it. A sound I hadn‚Äôt heard in years, but instantly recognized. **Claws. The soft click-clack of claws on concrete, heavy, Deliberate. Like something large was approaching.**

Approaching, I froze. My heart skipped. I turned toward the sound. Nothing. Just shadows stretching across the driveway. But I felt it‚Äîthat cold, crawling sensation on the back of my neck. Then the sound again. Closer this time. By my car. I snapped my head around toward it‚Äîand there it was. A shape. A shadow, tucked low beneath the frame. I couldn‚Äôt see it clearly at first, but I knew it was there. Watching. Still. Waiting. I squinted, slowly crouched, and leaned down to get a better look. My chest tightened. My breath caught in my throat. A dog? As I‚Äôd suspected‚Ä¶ sort of. It was under my car. But something was wrong. Its body was just slightly off‚Äîtoo long, too still. Its legs were bent at unnatural angles, as if it hadn‚Äôt moved in hours.   
  
And its eyes‚Äîdark, glassy, soulless. Like two lumps of coal staring back at me. It didn‚Äôt blink. It didn‚Äôt growl. It just stared. I stepped back and immediately muttered to myself, ‚ÄúGreat‚Ä¶ not a dog. Ugh.‚Äù It was the way it stared at me‚Äîlike it wanted something. Like it was trying to make me understand. Food? Water? Attention? Too bad. Annoyed, I grabbed a bucket near the trash bin and hurled it toward the car. ‚ÄúSHOO! Get outta here!‚Äù I shouted. The thing scrambled out from under the vehicle with unnatural speed, legs moving wrong, too quick for something that size. It bolted into the street‚Äîbut right as it hit the middle of the road, it seemed to go limp for just a second. Collapsing. Then it started crawling again‚Äîdragging itself across the asphalt until it disappeared into the bushes on the other side.  
  
 I huffed, shaking my head, and went back to finishing the trash. God, I was so sick of stray animals around here. Always causing problems‚Äîdigging through garbage, darting into traffic, spreading disease. Just a nuisance. Tsk. But as I turned to head back inside, something stuck with me. The way it crawled. That moment when it went limp in the street, then dragged itself across the pavement with jerky, unnatural movements‚Ä¶ I had seen it before somewhere, I didn‚Äôt know where or when. It clung to the edge of memory like a dream I wasn‚Äôt ready to remember. But I knew it. That crawl. That limp. That moment where something living moves like it shouldn‚Äôt. I swallowed hard, shook my head and told myself I was just tired‚Ä¶ after all, I had probably seen it in a horror movie or something.  
  
 The next morning, I had completely forgotten about the dog. Brushed it off like a weird dream, nothing worth remembering. I went about my day like normal‚Äîdrove to work, endured another horrible, long, exhausting shift, then came home just long enough to change out of my uniform before heading to the daycare to pick up Delilah. As I pulled up to the school, I rolled down my window to wave at her. She ran up smiling, laughing, full of that boundless energy I just couldn‚Äôt match. I forced a smile and unlocked the door.   
  
‚ÄúHave a good day, kiddo?‚Äù I asked, not even with enough energy to lift my voice out of its flat, monotone drag. She nodded eagerly.   
‚ÄúYeah!!! It was great! I played with Jeremy again. Me and Michelle pretended to be part of a wolf pack‚Äîwe made up stories under the playground!‚Äù  
  
 Ah, that‚Äôs cute‚Ä¶ I thought. But then, without changing tone or expression, she added:  
  
 ‚ÄúAnd the dog came back today.‚Äù  
  
 ‚ÄúUhuh‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled, almost on instinct. Then it registered. My body tensed‚Ä¶ Dog?  
  
 ‚ÄúWhat dog?''   
 I asked, even though I already knew. Delilah tilted her head, puzzled that I‚Äôd even question it.   
  
‚ÄúYour dog. The one that sleeps under your car. He‚Äôs always waiting for you, Daddy!‚Äù   
I blinked at her. My throat tightened.  
  
‚ÄúDelilah‚Ä¶‚Äù I said slowly, trying to keep my voice steady,   
  
‚ÄúThere is no dog. I think you‚Äôre just imagining things, sweetheart.‚Äù She just smiled back at me like she knew something I didn‚Äôt.  
  
‚ÄúHe told me he‚Äôs not mad anymore. He just wants you to come see him.‚Äù  
  
 I looked straight ahead and gripped the steering wheel a little too tightly. My palms had started to sweat.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough with the dog stuff, okay?‚Äù I muttered, trying to sound annoyed instead of afraid. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not funny‚Ä¶ Okay? And don‚Äôt pet that dog anymore, in fact, if you see it, leave it alone and pretend it‚Äôs not there‚Ä¶‚Äù   
  
Delilah looked at me, then lowered her head and began softly humming a sweet tune to herself in the backseat. I could feel a hint of sadness in her. She didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could tell‚Äîshe was disappointed that I didn't care about the dog. Disappointed that I wanted her to stop talking about it. Like I‚Äôd ruined something important‚Ä¶ something only she understood. I know kids love animals, but that dog clearly had rabies or something. The way it moved, the way it watched‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt right. I didn‚Äôt want Delilah getting too close. I didn‚Äôt want her getting sick, or worse. And if it really had been under my car‚Ä¶ I could‚Äôve hit it without even knowing. Just thinking about that made me stomach turn. We drove home in silence. It was only a five-minute ride, but the quiet made it feel like much longer‚Äîthick and uncomfortable, like the air had changed. And in that silence, my thoughts started spiraling.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not mad at you anymore.‚Äù

Was she talking about when I shooed it away? When I threw the bucket at it? That had only happened last night‚Ä¶ And I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about that, there were no neighbors outside, so how did she know? I glanced at her in the mirror. She was still silently humming to herself. She couldn‚Äôt have known about that‚Ä¶ We got home like usual. I unlocked the door and held it open for Delilah. She hopped out of the car, clutching her stuffed animal tight, her mood shifting again back to joy. She was already bouncing with excitement, happy to be home, talking about which toys she wanted to play with first. Although, I couldn‚Äôt shake the unease. I kept telling myself it was nothing. Just a kid being a kid. Probably making things up. Or maybe I just hadn‚Äôt really listened to what she said earlier. I was tired. That was all. Just tired. That‚Äôs what I told myself, naively, maybe even desperately.

As I followed her inside and shut the door behind us. She ran inside shouting ‚Äúyay!!‚Äù started rummaging through her toybox, I let out a sigh and began taking my coat off, I hung it on the rack then began walking over to the kitchen, ready to get myself some coffee. Then I saw them. Wet pawprints. Across the tile. Leading in from the door‚Ä¶ and disappearing into the hallway. Too large for a cat, and they weren‚Äôt just muddy. But damp? Like whatever made them came in out of nothing. Like it never should‚Äôve been there to begin with. No starting point from anywhere in particular. I stared, frozen. My breath caught in my throat. I began slowly following the footsteps, and in the middle of the hallway was Delilah‚Äôs stuffed animal. Not the one she walked in with. Another one, one I actually haven‚Äôt seen in a while. It was dirty. Matted with grime, like it had been buried somewhere. The fur was damp and discolored, and one of the eyes was missing. I stared at it, confused. Then I heard it again. From somewhere down the hall‚ÄîI heard the low sound of claws dragging across wood. Click‚Ä¶ Click‚Ä¶ Click‚Ä¶ Then‚Ä¶ it stepped out. Just for a moment. From the edge of the hallway, half-lit by the warm glow spilling from the kitchen light, it emerged.

The dog. If I could even call it that. Its body was all wrong. Too long. Legs too thin. Patches of fur hung off like it had been rotting in the dirt. Its mouth hung slightly open, not panting‚Äîbut gaping. As if trying to speak. Its eyes‚Äîthose same soulless brown eyes‚Äîlocked onto mine. And it smiled, exposing its teeth. Way too many teeth. Teeth growing out of random places in its gums. No sound. No movement. No retreating footsteps. And we just stared. It stared at me like it was trying to remind me of something. I couldn‚Äôt breath staring at it, I couldn‚Äôt blink. We just stared at each other for a few minutes. Then as silently as it appeared, it stepped backwards, one leg at a time, almost mechanical, it disappeared into the hallway being swallowed by the darkness. 

I stayed frozen in place. Too afraid to follow. Suddenly, I remembered. Where it walked‚ÄîIt was heading toward the living room. Towards Delilah. Panic shot through me like lightning. My body moved on its own, I bolted down the hallway with adrenaline rushing through me, Without thinking, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my keys, slipping them between my fingers like makeshift brass knuckles, it was the only weapon I had. My footsteps echoed against the floor as I turned the corner into the living room, Empty. No dog, No movement, Just Delilah sitting there on the carpet with her stuffed animal in her lap. A few toys scattered around her, She looked up at me and smiled sweetly, like nothing had happened. I turned away from her and began trying to catch my breath. Clearly, there was something wrong. I was tired and must have started seeing things. There weren‚Äôt any muddy footprints anymore, and every door was locked. I let out a final deep sigh as I turned to walk toward my bedroom‚Äî  
But before I could move, Delilah spoke.

**‚ÄúDaddy, he said it‚Äôs cold where you left him. He said it hurts.‚Äù**  
  
I froze. The air felt suddenly thinner, like the room had lost its oxygen. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. Something in her voice wasn‚Äôt right. Not afraid. Not sad. Just... empty. Like she was just passing along a message. A message that wasn‚Äôt hers. I immediately turned around and rushed into my room, slamming the door shut as I sat angrily on my bed. I closed my eyes. I knew. I hadn‚Äôt told anyone. I hadn‚Äôt spoken a word about that night. But I knew what it was now. That night‚ÄîI was tired. It was late. I had just gotten off work, got changed, and went to pick up Delilah. I remember how heavy my eyes were, how loud the silence in the car felt. I remember drifting off, with only the blur of the streetlights making its way into the cracks of my eyelids. And then I saw a shape in the road‚Äîa small, low-to-the-ground shadow‚Äîand before I knew it, a loud thump as body met steel. I felt my car jerk up as it rolled over the shape. Immediately, I slammed on the brakes and sat for a moment. The world had gone still.

‚ÄúOh... God, no! What‚Äîwhat was that? Jesus Christ.‚Äù

I slammed my fists onto the wheel angrily. ‚ÄúOf course it‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Bad things always happen to me.‚Äù I finally opened the car door and walked to the front of the car, heart pounding so hard it hurt‚Ä¶ I saw fur. Dark, matted fur.

‚ÄúA dog... it has to be a dog.‚Äù

I stared at it, knowing there was no saving it no matter how hard I tried. I panicked. I dug. Out by the old tree behind the property. My hands shaking. My head spinning. I buried it. I never looked back. Just drove.  
‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ GOD‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ the dog‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be.‚Äù   
  
I gripped the sides of my head, pressing my palms into my temples as if I could squeeze the thought out of existence. ‚ÄúI mean, I don‚Äôt even like dogs‚Ä¶‚Äù I laughed‚Äîshort, bitter, hollow. ‚ÄúJesus...‚Äù But the more I said it, the less I believed it. Because I remembered the fur. I remembered how warm it still was. And I remembered how small the shape looked in the road. I shook the thought from my head, numbly peeled back the covers, and crawled into bed like I was trying to escape into sleep.

The next morning came too fast. My body felt heavier than usual, like I hadn‚Äôt slept at all. I got Delilah ready for daycare like I always did. She was in her usual good mood, humming to herself while holding her stuffed animal. I tried to act normal. Forced a smile. Packed her lunch. Buckled her into the back seat. The drive was quiet. The sky was gray, and the roads were still slick with morning dew. I kept my eyes fixed on the asphalt, knuckles tight around the steering wheel, my thoughts a blur of guilt and disbelief. As we pulled up to the daycare entrance, I got out and unbuckled her seatbelt, she leaped out of her chair and gave me a big hug.

‚ÄúGoodbye daddy!! I‚Äôll see you later!!‚Äù

 she said brightly before skipping off towards the school entrance. I sighed and gave her a soft wave, before noticing the teachers, one of the daycare staff had come out to check the drop-off list. She paused when she saw me‚Äîher expression uncertain, almost nervous. Another teacher by the door leaned over and whispered something to her, glancing in my direction. Just... staring at me. I brushed it off and turned around ready to get back in my car. Then I noticed it

The sidewalk was muddy from the rain the night before, and Delilah‚Äôs shoes should‚Äôve left their usual little patterned prints behind her. But they didn‚Äôt. Where her feet had touched, were pawprints. Not just vaguely shaped, actual dog pawprints, with long wide claw impressions. Almost exactly what I had seen in my apartment. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But they were still there‚Ä¶ Delilah turned and waved at me once more before stepping inside. She didn‚Äôt notice, or say anything about it. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. But I could still feel it‚Äîsomething off in the air. Like static. Like watching a dream start to slip through your fingers the second you try to hold onto it. I shook my head and hurried back to the car, trying to avoid eye contact with the staff still watching me. As I got in and shut the door, I just stared at the steering wheel. I didn‚Äôt drive off right away, my head was racing too much, I was confused, I kept trying to think of solutions. 

The dog.  
The footprints.  
Delilah.

What the hell is happening? Is it trying to speak to me? Through my daughter? What exactly does that damn thing want? My breathing was shallow now. My fingers gripped the wheel so tight it ached. I closed my eyes‚Äîbut the image of those pawprints stayed behind my eyelids. Pressed there. Branded. Like it was following me. Getting closer. Piece by piece.

**""NO!""** I shouted, snapping my eyes open and jamming the key into the ignition. The engine roared to life and I hauled out of the parking lot, tires screeching slightly on the pavement. I started racing home, thoughts crashing into each other as I tried to talk myself down.

**""Maybe they were just confused because my wife usually drops her off...""**  
**""Maybe there was a dog walking there before Delilah stepped in the same spot...""**  
**""Maybe I‚Äôm just...""**

I trailed off, jaw tight. Because no matter how many excuses I came up with‚Äînone of them felt right.

I drove to work, just on reflex, but the entire time I was still thinking, sweating, and feeling like I was losing my mind. At work, I was fidgety and paranoid, constantly checking over my shoulder like that dog would just appear in the breakroom. Any noise I heard or shapes I saw in the corner of my eyes would frighten me. I couldn‚Äôt imagine what it wanted, and I worried about what it could do or might do to my daughter. All I knew was something was wrong.

**Deeply, violently wrong.**

Eventually, the clock hit 7 p.m. It was time to pick Delilah up. I left work fast, barely remembering to clock out. My hands were slick on the steering wheel, my pulse pounding. The sky was gray, and it was lightly raining down; each sound of the raindrops hitting my car gave me anxiety. I pulled into the daycare lot. Everything looked normal. Kids waiting by the doors. Parents chatting, and picking up their kids. But Delilah wasn‚Äôt there. She was usually standing in the exact same spot, ready for me to pick her up. My heart sank. I got out of the car and ran up to a daycare worker.

**""Hey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here for Delilah.""**

She stared at me, losing her smile. She let out an annoyed sigh before speaking.  
**""You‚Äôve come here before... asking about her. We told you then too.""**  
My chest tightened.  
  
**""What are you talking about? I come here every weekend, I pick her up at seven. I just dropped her off this morning‚Äîyou saw me!""**

She glanced back at another staff member behind her, then leaned in a little, voice barely above a whisper.  
**""Delilah told us you left something.""**

The words rang in my ears, louder than the rain. I stared at her. My mouth moved but nothing came out. She stepped back slightly, still watching me‚Äîlike she was waiting for me to understand something she didn‚Äôt want to be the one to say.

I turned around and walked slowly back to my car, the rain hitting harder now, soaking through my jacket. And there it was. Across the lot. At the edge of the woods.

The dog.  
Staring.  
Silent.  
Still.

I didn‚Äôt need any more signs. I didn‚Äôt need more dreams, more messages, more footprints. I got back in the car, turned the engine, and drove. Not home. Not to the police. But to the spot.

The spot behind the property, where the old trees leaned sideways like they were trying to fall away from the truth buried beneath them. I parked. Left the car running. Walked into the brush.

The rain made the dirt soft. Easy to dig. No shovel needed. My hands clawed through the mud, soaked and shaking, pulling at the earth like it owed me something. Like it could undo what I had done. As I dug, the smell hit me. Sharp. Rotting. Familiar. It curled in my throat. Burned my eyes. And it wasn‚Äôt long before it hit flesh. It wasn‚Äôt rotted yet. Not decomposed like it should have been. I stared down into the grave.  
**""I don‚Äôt know what you want, dog... do you want to be reunited with your owners? A proper burial?""** Then, as I stared, I noticed something. The flesh‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt furry as a dog should be. It was pale. Like skin.

My hands trembled harder, and I panicked and began frantically pulling more of the dirt away. A pink sleeve emerged.  
A small shoe.  
And then‚ÄîA tiny hand. Curled. Not paws. But fingers.

I froze. A noise escaped my mouth‚Äîsomething between a gasp and a sob.

**""No‚Ä¶""** I whispered. **""No, please‚Äîno‚Äî""**  
The sweater was hers. The shoes were hers. The little body beneath the mud was‚Äî  
**""NO! GOD NO. WHAT? NO! WHAT IS THIS? THE DOG?? WHERE'S THE DOG‚Ä¶ I‚ÄîNO!""**

I scrambled backward in the mud, choking on the weight of the moment, slipping and clawing at the ground like it could undo what I was seeing.

**""It was a DOG! I SWEAR! IT‚ÄôS SUPPOSED TO BE A DOG! I HIT A DOG!""**

I shouted into the storm, voice cracking, tears swelling in my eyes as I stared at the corpse. I looked around me, then rubbed my eyes‚Äîbut still, the body didn‚Äôt change to a dog. I shouted again in disbelief, **""NO! PLEASE NO! TELL ME IT ISN‚ÄôT TRUE!""**

But there was no answer.

Just the rain.  
Just the silence.  
And the body I had tried so hard to forget.  
Lying in the dirt, it was her.  
**Delilah.**

I killed her.  
And buried her.  
And convinced myself it was a stray.  
Because I couldn‚Äôt live with the truth.

And she knows I left her. She knows I didn‚Äôt call anyone.  
Didn‚Äôt scream for help. And when I felt her body go cold,  
I told myself it wasn‚Äôt her. That it couldn‚Äôt be her.  
So I dug a hole‚Äî  
Shaking. Crying. And put her in the ground.

That‚Äôs why the dog watched me.  
It was just always waiting.  
**Patiently.**

For me to acknowledge it.

Because it wasn‚Äôt there to haunt me.

It just wanted to remind me‚Äî  
**It was time.**",2,1749441771.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kqv2r3/aio_that_my_friend_cried_at_my_engagement_party/): **May 19, 2025**

I have a friend of about 10 years, let's call her Elle, that I asked to help with my wedding by being my day-of coordinator. I'm a wedding planner myself, I just need someone I can trust to pull off the timing. She is a wedding planner in NYC for high end clients so I know just how skilled she is first hand. She was thrilled to work with me. For about 8 months, we met for coffee and chatted every so often to catch her up on my plans. It felt like an absolutdly perfect fit.

Fast forward to my engagement party. My MOH hosted the party and my bridesmaids put it all together. It was a beautiful masterpiece and could not have been ANY better. It was magical. Until about 1 hour before the end. All of a sudden my friend Elle is in tears. She informs me that she remembered that today was the anniversary of a really traumatic event in her life and she was having a panic attack. I was so concerned for her and I wanted her to have her privacy and know that I was there for her. I sat with her after my MOH consoled her and we hugged and cried together as I talked her thru it. She said she wanted to rejoin the group but ultimately ended up leaving after going to the bathroom without saying anything to anyone. We sent her some texts but knew she would need some time and space before she replied.

The next morning, I wake up to a voicemail from Elle saying that she'll no longer be my coordinator because she felt unsupported and betrayed while she was going through a crisis. She felt the party shouldn't have continued and we should have focused on cheering her up as a group. She also felt unthanked for planning my party. I was pretty shocked. Not only by her accusations, but... My BRIDESMAIDS planned my party and my MOH was the host... Am I missing something here? I apologized to her and told her I really thought I had tried my best to comfort her and help but that really was not good enough to her and sounded like excuses. I cant stop thinking about how I just feel like I have whiplash about this whole thing. It was supposed to be, and was at first, one of our happiest days leading up to our wedding, but the hours and days following it have just felt like a dark cloud. Now we are 6 months aeay from the wedding with a lot of loose ends and a bruised heart Am I OverReacting?

TLDR; My friend and wedding coordinator had a panic attack at my engagement party and was upset that the party didnt stop and that we didn't comfort her the way she wanted/needed. She wont be my coordinator anymore now.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** A high-end wedding planner should know that the wedding festivities go on despite their own feelings. Trying to hijack your attention from your own engagement party reeks of deeper issues. If you feel she deserves one good conversation and maybe a chance, it seems reasonable, given her previous reputation. However, if you think separation would ease any anxiety, you would be well justified.

> **OOP:** Thank you, I appreciate you saying that. I guess I just feel guilty for resting on ""it's my party"" in a sense but maybe I'm boiling it down too much. I didnt try to convince her to stay because I would be destroyed if something like this happened again on my wedding night. As much as I hate to say it.
> 
> Edit: and you make a really great point about her professionalism...

**Commenter 2:** NOR. Do you think maybe she‚Äôs a bit jealous that someone else threw an event that you loved so much? That it‚Äôs ‚Äòher bag‚Äô and somehow she resents that the party went well and directing those emotions towards you?

You did nothing wrong and it would have been wrong and insanely awkward for everyone else to stop the party because she was upset. A rational person would have taken themselves away from the party or even home if they were that distressed!

> **OOP:** Wow. I hadnt considered that she was jealous for that reason, but you could be right. She had said a few things that seemed off to me, like they were compliments but somehow she wasnt happy about it for me and I didnt know what to make of it.
> 
> Thanks for saying so. I tried to put myself in her shoes, and felt sympathy for her, but had trouble reconciling with her conclusions. Do you think its worth being honest with her in any capacity? What I mean is, at our last convo she knes she needed an apology and to express herself and achieved those things. But I was blindsided so I can't say I did a good job defending myself üòî or knowing I needed to

**Commenter 3:** I'm sorry.?. After what I'm assuming was over a period of time worth of discussions about the engagement party, (and just friend to friend conversations because that's what friends do, since she didn't plan or host it), how did it take until 1 hour before it ended for her to REMEMBER the anniversary of a tragic event? I'll admit, I have some events that happened in my life that I consider to be tragic but I'm still a lil shakey on the dates. I may not remember the exact date but I know the time frame. Or I might be consumed by life and not actually realize that today is that date. But she had to have known the date of the engagement party and had talked about it on more than one occasion. How did she never remember an event that was so tragic to the point of having a panic attack was approaching? Let's just say that's what happened. Why are you expected to end your celebration to cater to her? You and others took the time out to step aside and console her. You gave her time and privacy to gather herself. She decided she couldn't handle it and left, without notice. How is that your fault? Did she really expect you to tell you guest the party was over because she suddenly remembered a tragic event, that you seem to be unaware of (I could be wrong) during a ten year friendship span. I don't mean to sound harsh, but if she didn't need or expect your support for this anniversary every year, why were you expected to put your life on hold for it that day? I would like to think that if you'd known about it, you wouldn't have had it on that day or at the very least told her you would understand that she couldn't make it. But how are you to do this in consideration of something that happened in her life that she didn't even remember herself?

> **OOP:** I think theres a lot to be said for not realizing what day it is so I wont sit here and speculate that. But one thing I will say is that throughout the past 4 months that the party was being planned, she never once mentioned it when I told her the date, sent her the invitation, and we made plans for her to come to town surrounding the date. Her goal was to attend the party and also make a weekend out of wedding planning before and afterwards. About 3 days prior to the party, she did tell me a story about this traumatic event but I had no context for how long ago it happened or that I should know this weekend was going to be an important date in that story. I felt oblivious to the small details I ended up being held responsible for. I'll be honest and say that I wouldn't move my party if it was already planned but I would understand if she couldnt come.

**OOP clarifies details on if she was planning to pay Elle for doing the wedding planning**

> **OOP:** Thank you. And yes just to clarify, I was going to cover her costs for travel, gas, lodging, etc. as it pertains to the wedding coordinating. So since I wont be incurring any of those ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I guess a thank you note will do it. And yes I think that youre right that I cant possibly have her at my wedding. She wasnt even on my radar of people to worry about and I dont need to knowingly add one, thats for sure! I dont doubt that something like this would definitely happen.

+

> I offered to pay, she insisted it be a gift, I insisted I at least cover her expenses. Plus, she is the day-of coordinator. I am planning the entire wedding, down to decor and the agenda, she would execute organization, schedule, and directing staff.
> 
> So you think I deserved to have this happen because she insisted on gifting her services? And I'm curious what you think I could have done differently.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/comments/1kxx4st/update_my_friend_cried_at_my_engagement_party/): **May 28, 2025 (9 days later)** 

Hey everyone, I have an update. My ex-wedding coordinator, after apparent deliberation in the past few weeks, is saying she realizes now how selfish she had been and how poorly she treated me at and surrounding the party. I feel like my MOH must have said something to her. I only know what I've been able to gather from her 45 second voicemails that she's been leaving me before they cut her off. She seems to be sincere in wanting to apologize face to face, and that's okay I guess, but I'm just struggling with whether or not it's even right for me to be friends with someone like this, even if they're not invited to the wedding and don't live near me. And HOW do you be friends with someone you wouldn't invite to your wedding, not because the guest list is full, but no matter how long or short the guest list was...

I haven't heard her out yet but shes asking for some form of communication with me. I don't even think I'm willing to have a conversation with her to take her apology but would probably prefer her to write it to me instead whether that be email, text, or if she prefers handwriting. I just dont want to be caught in a torrent of rebuttals and ""but""s tacked on to the end of what was supposed to be an apology to me. I'm terrified of getting baited into a conversation where I feel yet again cornered and bullied because she turns it around on me somewhere. My head is a little spinny. Halp?!

OG Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/tJgeS6pWFO

**2nd Update:** Thank you to everyone that read the posts before commenting and thank you for your words of encouragement. Just to clarify, I *never* received any apology in the voicemails she left so whether or not I speak to her again, I don't consider it ""apology accepted"". Shes not ""forgiven"". Also, she was never going to be my wedding coordinator after the day she tried to withdraw. There is no changing that. I am an experienced event planner and have learned that when a vendor lets you down big the first time, you let them go forever. It wasnt going to be that way with our friendship until all of this went down. I let her know that I did receive her voicemails but dont wish to speak to her and have nothing left to say outside of what my MOH likely said to her (from all the crying I did to her while I was processing all of this). I let her know a few more things I felt she should know and that she can write to me but I wont be responding as if it's a back and forth; this isnt up for debate. I'll update here again if/when she writes.

**3rd Update for anyone that was interested:** I got an email from Elle today and she was too pissed off at me for unfriending/unfollowing her on Social Media so she told me that she didnt have time for my bullshit. It was as short as that, really. So there's nothing left to do or say and maybe I won't forgive her but I'll do my best to forget about it. Thanks to everyone that commented and was invested. Each of you gave me a little support.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It sounds like you're not really interested in being friends with her, totally fair, and I'd feel the same tbh.

If it was me, I'd probably text and say hey I got your messages, I'm not in a place where I want to be talking to you right now and just want to focus on wedding planning and events. That you appreciate the apology and maybe you'll reach out after the wedding.

That's probably what I would do. If her apology is genuine, she'll quit bugging you after that. But it sounds like she's got main character syndrome in spades, so she might put up a fuss. Then you can say you're not looking for drama right now, and if she doesn't leave you alone, you'll have to block her until after the wedding.

> **OOP:** Youre right. I'm not anymore. I think at first I felt like it was just another lost friendship. Because I've had to draw these lines in the sand before with friends who were the kind who are always ""down on their luck"" but always making decisions to get themselves there. When things would go sideways between us, I would always feel guilty, even if I was the one with the grievance. I wasnt emotionally mature enough to understand that someone can be mad at you but it doesnt mean you did anything wrong. I was never able to tell before. Now, it just takes me a while to come around. Its a little easier So thank you for your feedback (and everyones here, even if I didnt respond personally).

**OOP needs to make sure Elle can't get into the venue on the wedding day**

> **OOP:** She lives hundreds of miles away. I think I'm good.

**Commenter 2:** You said this so perfectly: ""I'm terrified of getting baited into a conversation where I feel yet again cornered and bullied because she turns it around on me somewhere."" This does not sound like a person you trust any more. (Nor would most people, I'm guessing, not that I know ""most people."")

If you have to walk on eggshells, if you know she is not really attuned to you except to figure out where she can make the conversation about her, if she bullies you, then there's not much friendship to be found any longer.

I think you're on the right track to say that you're only comfortable with written exchanges right now. (""Right now"" is vague, possibly stretching to ""forever."") You already know that she misrepresents things. You already know that she badgers you. Let her write it down, because then she has a chance to be more thoughtful, and you have a chance to hand the unread letter to your lovely MIL and ask her to read it & just give you the gist.

After that, you write back briefly to say ""thank you"" for whatever you want to thank her for, wedding-wise, thank her for the apology if you want (you can just say ""I appreciate...""), and say (after or before the above), ""This obviously has come between us, and that's sad, but it's for the best that we part ways here,"" or whatever you want -- fairly soupy, if you want; even obviously insincere, if you want. You're just ending things politely.

> **OOP:** This was definitely one of the top comments on this post. Thank you. I am avoiding saying things like ""I appreciate"" because I am sugar coating nothing at this point, but I have been cordial. Waiting on my apology to decide if my mind is made up fully.

My wife lies beside me, her breath steady, her body deep in sleep. Sleepily, I pull myself closer to her, press my face gently to her neck, and breathe her in. I slowly kiss the soft skin between her shoulders.

I feel Fig stir between us, so I reach down and his tail gives one lazy thump. It makes me want to stay. But the stillness of the morning feels eternal, like nothing could shake it. There‚Äôs an unfamiliar clarity to everything, like I‚Äôm remembering it. For a moment I let myself slip away.

I sit up and press my toes into the carpet threads. I breathe in deeply and feel it leave my chest. For the first time, I do not feel a sense of urgency to do more or the ache of wanting something else.

I look up at the window. The soft sunlight sharpens, and through it, a figure comes into focus it's a woman that I don't remember arriving, she's quietly sitting¬† across from me.

‚ÄúDo you remember what happened yesterday?‚Äù she asks gently.

I answer steadily. ""I woke up before my alarm and let my family sleep in. I went to the bathroom and made some coffee before leaving for work...""

She nods slowly, watching me closely. ‚ÄúOkay. That‚Äôs good. Then what?‚Äù

I frown. ‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm not sure. I remember playing with Fig a bit... I probably drove to work. Maybe I got gas before work...?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, and did anything happen at work?‚Äù

I pause. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. Or maybe it did. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just... blank.‚Äù

She tilts her head gently. ‚ÄúCan you remember what you were wearing? Did you talk to anyone new?‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúNo... or maybe? I don't know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about the weather? Was it raining, sunny, cold?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it was sunny. Or at least... I thought it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you remember what Fig was doing when you got home?‚Äù she asks, her voice still soft but probing.

I blink. ‚ÄúI really don't remember.‚Äù

Her voice softens further. She frowns slightly, then leans in and gently rests her elbows on her crossed knees. ‚ÄúI think you are suppressing traumatic memories.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I feel fine. Better than fine, actually‚ÄîI feel amazing. I really don't have any sense that something is wrong.‚Äù

She nods again, her expression unreadable. ‚ÄúIt might be something very traumatic, and you've worked really hard to forget it in order to protect yourself.‚Äù

I slow down for a moment. ‚ÄúI just... I don‚Äôt want to lose this sense of peace. I'm happier than I have ever been. Why dig something up if it‚Äôs not hurting me now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut are you sure that it's not hurting you anymore? Do you think you've truly found real peace?‚Äù

""Yes!"" But my smile falters.

‚ÄúReal peace can hold the truth.‚Äù

I look up at her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember what I did in the afternoon.‚Äù

She leans in slightly, concern softening her face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs actually very common when something traumatic happens. Sometimes the mind tries to protect us. Maybe you‚Äôre not ready yet, but maybe it‚Äôs time to try.‚Äù

My chest tightens. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm happy. Happier than I‚Äôve ever been. What if remembering takes that away? What if knowing the truth makes everything else feel like a lie? What if I can‚Äôt come back from it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúwhat if this happy feeling you have isn't real because it doesn't hold the truth?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt answer. And I don‚Äôt want to.

She leans back, her voice still gentle but firmer now. ""Let‚Äôs try something else, to see if we can jog something loose and bring whatever is hidden into the light.""

‚Äî-

The room shifts, the light softens, and shapes begin to form in the haze. Figures slowly come into focus around me‚Äîabout a dozen in all. We are seated around a small rec room, each of us paired with someone similar to the woman who first questioned me. They are all thoughtful and insistent, each trying different memory exercises one after another: word associations, images, even smells and sounds.

The person across from me shows me a picture of a house‚Äîsomething about it clicks. A wide, rectangular metal window frame‚Äîlike the kind you'd see on an old school bus‚Äîdivided into two panes and secured with four narrow safety bars.

""I've seen this before,"" I murmur. But what could possibly be traumatic about that?

Then the scent of sweet air, salt, and laughter.

Another person in the room says, ""I remember sharing a bag of peanuts with someone.""

A woman whispers, ""There was a song on the radio. I don‚Äôt know the words, but it was playing in the background.""

I see the window. I can taste the peanuts. I smell sweet and salty air. How could anything terrible be tied to these things?

Gradually I hear the radio over the soft buzz of voices sitting behind me. Then I remember: ""Ti kaneis, malaka!""

The words slowly form on my tongue until the phrase finally erupts in my mind like a punchline to a joke.

""Ti kaneis, malaka..."" I repeat, the strange words that feel familiar on my tongue.

‚Äî-

I'm in the passenger seat of a tour bus, next to the driver, cruising along a narrow mountain road that overlooks the Mediterranean, hugging the cliffs with dizzying drops. The blue sea stretches endlessly to the right and glimmers in the sun. Behind me, the bus is full of strangers who are familiar friends for the afternoon. A crumpled paper bag of sugar-coated peanuts sits between us.

Then, there he is‚ÄîDimitri. Everyone in the village knows Dimitri! People have known his family since his mom's mom was in diapers. Dimitri is always in a good mood‚Äîlaughing at his own jokes, offering unsolicited advice, and handing out spare change to kids on a humid day.

It‚Äôs become a tour guide tradition‚Äîa running joke: whenever we drive by Dimitri, in unison everyone on the bus yells out the windows, ‚ÄúTi kaneis, malaka!‚Äù

Eager for the moment, smiling, I turn to face the group and announce, ‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs Dimitri! You know what to do!‚Äù

Their eyes light up as people shift in their seats‚Äîsome stretching to see through the windows across the aisle, others leaning in close to peer through the bars on the windows.

I lean out the open passenger window with my arm waving wildly. As one, we shout, ‚ÄúTI KANEIS, MALAKA!‚Äù

‚Äî-

We cheer, and I sit back down into my seat, satisfied. Strapping my seat belt back on, I turn to the driver, grinning. ‚ÄúWait... That was yesterday! And that‚Äôs what happened! I remember now. But why couldn't we remember this?‚Äù

The driver's smile widens. Without removing his hands from the top of the steering wheel, he turns his head, our eyes lock, and he says‚Äî

# Best Cuisinart Coffee Maker Filters [2025 Review]

The Cuisinart coffee maker is a staple in many kitchens, known for its reliability and ability to brew consistently good coffee. However, the quality of your brew is heavily influenced by the filter you use. Selecting the right Cuisinart coffee maker filter is crucial for achieving optimal flavor, preventing sediment, and ensuring the longevity of your machine. This review delves into the best Cuisinart coffee maker filters available in 2025, considering factors like material, filtration efficiency, compatibility, and overall value.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a Cuisinart coffee maker filter hinges on several key features that impact both the brewing process and the overall coffee experience.

**Material Composition:** The material of the filter directly affects the taste of the coffee and its ability to trap unwanted particles. Paper filters, typically made from bleached or unbleached paper pulp, are disposable and offer excellent filtration. Permanent filters, usually constructed from stainless steel or gold-tone mesh, are reusable and designed to last for extended periods. The choice between paper and permanent filters depends on personal preference regarding convenience, environmental impact, and perceived taste differences.

**Filtration Efficiency:** Filtration efficiency refers to the filter's capability to remove oils, sediments, and other impurities from the coffee grounds. High-efficiency filters produce a cleaner, brighter cup of coffee with less bitterness. Paper filters generally offer superior filtration compared to permanent filters, resulting in a smoother taste. However, some coffee enthusiasts prefer the richer, fuller-bodied flavor that can be achieved with permanent filters due to the passage of some oils.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model is paramount. Cuisinart coffee makers typically use either cone-shaped or basket-shaped filters. Using the wrong filter type can lead to improper brewing, overflow, and potential damage to the machine. Always refer to your coffee maker's manual or the manufacturer's website to determine the correct filter size and shape.

**Ease of Cleaning (for Permanent Filters):** For permanent filters, ease of cleaning is a significant consideration. Stainless steel filters are generally easier to clean than gold-tone filters, as coffee oils and residues tend to adhere less to stainless steel. Look for filters that are dishwasher-safe or can be easily rinsed under running water to minimize maintenance effort.

**Durability (for Permanent Filters):** The durability of a permanent filter is crucial for long-term use. Stainless steel filters are known for their robustness and resistance to corrosion. Gold-tone filters, while aesthetically pleasing, can be more susceptible to damage if not handled carefully. A well-constructed filter should withstand repeated use and cleaning without warping or tearing.

**Environmental Impact:** The environmental impact of coffee filters is an increasingly important consideration for consumers. Paper filters, while disposable, contribute to landfill waste. Reusable permanent filters offer a more sustainable alternative, reducing the need for single-use products. Some paper filters are also made from recycled materials or are compostable, further minimizing their environmental footprint.

Key features of Cuisinart coffee maker filters include:

*   Material composition (paper, stainless steel, gold-tone)
*   Filtration efficiency
*   Compatibility with specific Cuisinart models
*   Ease of cleaning (for permanent filters)
*   Durability (for permanent filters)
*   Environmental impact

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right Cuisinart coffee maker filter offers several practical benefits that enhance the overall coffee brewing and consumption experience.

**Improved Coffee Flavor:** The type of filter significantly impacts the flavor profile of your coffee. Paper filters tend to produce a cleaner, brighter taste by removing more oils and sediments. Permanent filters, on the other hand, allow some oils to pass through, resulting in a richer, fuller-bodied flavor. Selecting a filter that aligns with your preferred taste profile can elevate your coffee enjoyment.

**Reduced Sediment in Coffee:** High-quality filters effectively minimize the amount of sediment that ends up in your cup. This is particularly important for those who prefer a smooth, clean coffee without gritty residue. Paper filters generally excel at sediment removal, while some permanent filters may allow a small amount of fine particles to pass through.

**Cost Savings (with Permanent Filters):** Investing in a durable permanent filter can lead to significant cost savings over time, as you eliminate the need to purchase disposable paper filters regularly. While the initial cost of a permanent filter is higher, the long-term savings can be substantial, especially for frequent coffee drinkers.

**Environmental Friendliness (with Permanent Filters or Compostable Paper Filters):** Opting for a reusable permanent filter or compostable paper filters contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle. Permanent filters reduce landfill waste by eliminating the need for single-use products. Compostable paper filters decompose naturally, minimizing their environmental impact compared to traditional paper filters.

**Enhanced Coffee Maker Longevity:** Using the correct filter for your Cuisinart coffee maker helps prevent clogs and buildup of oils and sediments within the machine. This, in turn, contributes to the longevity of your coffee maker and reduces the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions regarding Cuisinart coffee maker filters can help clarify any uncertainties and assist in making informed purchasing decisions.

**Are all Cuisinart coffee maker filters the same size?**
No, Cuisinart coffee maker filters come in different sizes and shapes, primarily cone-shaped and basket-shaped. The correct filter size depends on the specific model of your Cuisinart coffee maker. Refer to your coffee maker's manual or the manufacturer's website to determine the appropriate filter size and shape for your machine.

**How often should I replace my permanent Cuisinart coffee maker filter?**
While permanent filters are designed to last for an extended period, they may eventually require replacement due to wear and tear or damage. Inspect your filter regularly for any signs of damage, such as tears, warping, or corrosion. If you notice any of these issues, replace the filter immediately to ensure optimal performance and prevent potential damage to your coffee maker. Generally, a high-quality stainless steel filter can last for several years with proper care.

**Can I use generic coffee filters in my Cuisinart coffee maker?**
Yes, you can use generic coffee filters in your Cuisinart coffee maker, provided that they are the correct size and shape for your machine. However, keep in mind that the quality of generic filters can vary significantly. Lower-quality filters may be thinner, less durable, and less effective at filtering out sediments and oils. For optimal results, consider using Cuisinart-branded filters or high-quality generic filters from reputable brands.

**How do I clean my permanent Cuisinart coffee maker filter?**
To clean your permanent Cuisinart coffee maker filter, rinse it thoroughly under running water after each use to remove coffee grounds and residues. For a more thorough cleaning, you can wash the filter with warm, soapy water. Some filters are also dishwasher-safe. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can damage the filter material. Regular cleaning helps maintain the filter's performance and prevents the buildup of oils and sediments.

I'm sorry, this is a long one guys, a lot has happened and I don't want to leave anything out.

I, 27 m, finally met my online best friend, 26 m, in person for the first time this weekend.
We met online in 2015 on an app called whisper, a social media app where you can anonymously post messages and pictures, comment on peoples' posts, and private messages. I was on vacation with my family after coming out as transgender (ftm) and posted on whisper asking if there were any other trans people who wanted to chat. My friend, let‚Äôs call him Sam, privately messaged me on the app, and we had an instant connection.

Sam has been there with me through a lot over the years (moving, job changes, relationships), but neither of us ever had the means to visit each other. We would have phone calls, text, Facetime video, you name it. We had breaks in our friendship where we didn't talk for a while, but no matter how much time had passed, we could always pick up right where we had left off.

About two weeks ago, Sam told me he is travelling close to my area for an event, and wanted to try and finally meet up. He was hoping to come Friday and meet up with me after work, go to his event on Saturday while I was working, come back Saturday night and get an air bnb, and head back home midday Sunday (today).

I have a lot of anxiety, but I knew that if I didn't say yes, we wouldn't know the next chance we would have to meet in person. So against my better judgement, I said yes. Fast forward to this past Thursday. My parents weren't comfortable with Sam staying in the house because they had never met him before, Sam knew this but he assured me he would find accommodations; whether it is finding an air bnb, sleeping at a truck stop in his car overnight, or finding a camping site between my parents' house and his event on Saturday. All sounded good. The plan was for him to leave in the morning Friday and meet me after I finished work around 4:30 pm.

I woke up Friday to a message from him at 3 am, saying he would let me know when he is leaving (it's about a 7 hour drive, and across the border), only for him to message me later saying he slept in. He didn't end up leaving until nearly 2 pm, meaning he wasn't going to be arriving until 9 pm. I figured, even though I was really annoyed, we could still have a good couple hours to chill and talk before the end of the day.

As I was finishing at work, he called and we talked about his drive so far, what we could do tonight, and agreed I'd go to a dispensary before they close, since we are both potheads. It was then he told me, ""you better have a pizza for me when I get there."" I responded, ""what? Why?"" and he said, ""because I've been driving all day and I'm going to be hungry when I get there."" I thought it was kind of demanding, but I understood where he was coming from, so I said fine and had the pizza order scheduled to arrive soon after he did.
I went home, tried to relax, and waited for this highly anticipated moment of finally meeting my long distance friend. I wait outside with my dog, scrolling on my phone and Sam pulls into the driveway. We hugged each other, sat on the front porch, talked for a few minutes before the pizza arrived, and agreed that we should call it a night around 12. Sounds good to me, I had to be up at 8:30 for work Saturday.

We smoke, we chat some more, and bounce around stories (ADHD made that interesting), and head inside around 11. We went to chill in my room, said hi to my parents and older sister on the way, and I grabbed Sam's pizza, leaving mine on the counter, intending to eat some after Sam left. My anxiety makes me very uncomfortable and nauseous when I try eating food when I'm nervous, but he was aware of this.

We spent maybe 30 minutes just chatting, when he asked if we could go smoke outside again. I said sure and we went out back for a bit. We went back to my room, and Sam was on his laptop when he told me he can no longer book an air bnb. I asked why, and it turns out after midnight, you can no longer book something for ""that night"" because it's considered the next day. It was at this point that Sam opened his pizza box and finally started eating his pizza (you know, the pizza that he so desperately needed as soon as he arrived).

We then spent the next hour looking for somewhere he can stay for the night. There were different cities between mine and the one his event was in, and he wanted to find a location that was EXACTLY half way, so he can drive some that night, and some the next morning. It's maybe a 4 1/2 hour drive to the event. We went through each city I mentioned but there was always something wrong with them.

The first city was a 1 1/2 hour and 3 hour split; he didn't want to drive 3 hours Saturday morning. The second city was a 2h 45m and 1h 45m split; that was too much driving for him right now. The third city was a 2 1/2 hour and 2 hour split; but that wasn't close enough to exactly half way. At this point it's 1 am, and I'm getting really tired after working all day, but I couldn't just kick him out without finding somewhere to sleep. We ended up finding a city that would be a 2h 20 minute and 2h 10 minute split, and apparently this time split was what he was looking for. Great, let's look for a hotel in that city and book it, right? WRONG.

He then finds a 4.3 star hotel, and borrows my phone to call the hotel, but hung up the phone without saying a word. ""Your phone sucks, I couldn't hear anything he was saying. Can you call?"" I was starting to get fed up, and grabbed my phone to call myself. I turned the volume up on the call and asked the man if we would be able to book a room for the night, to which he said yes. I look up at Sam, and he's not even paying attention to the call, not even looking at me. I ask the man on the phone if I can talk to my friend and we will figure out details to book the room.

I hung up the phone, told Sam about them having a room available, and handed him my phone to call back and book his room. He doesn't take my phone from me, but instead looks at me and says, ""Okay, well call them back and book me a room."" .... What.... I tell him absolutely not, I explain my anxiety on the phone and not having the information to book the room for him. He replies, ""you'll never get over your anxiety at this rate. Just call, I'll give you my credit card to book it.""

I flat out refuse to call the hotel back, at which point he says, ""fine, I'll just sleep in my car,"" and starts looking for truck stops between the cities. I'm getting increasingly tired and irritated, just playing dumb games on my phone, until he finds a spot and starts packing up his stuff for the night. He asked me to keep his laptop for the night, and he puts it in his backpack. ""yep, that's fine. We are hanging out tomorrow anyways.""

UGH! It's almost 2 am and we go downstairs. I hadn't eaten yet, and I'm about to crash. We are standing in the kitchen when Sam says, ""Can I say something unsolicited?"" I responded, ""Oh god, what is it?"" ... I sh*t you not, he looks dead in my eyes and says, ""I didn't realize how ugly your sister is."" WHO SAYS THAT. 

From that moment on, something changed and I no longer wanted to hang out anymore. I love my sister, and I guess I'm very protective of her, and this honestly broke my heart that he said this to me. I just turned white and said, ""Oh my god Sam, that's so mean! Don't say that."" He just laughs it off, and the send off was just weird. I felt so uncomfortable, and I ended up lying in bed after eating some food, overthinking how the next couple days are about to go.

Saturday, I get up for work, I am a complete zombie. Sam asked me to bring his backpack to work, because he forgot some stuff from it and needed it when he got back. I grabbed it in my slump/grumpy mood, and headed to the kitchen. My mom, bless her, asks me how my night was, and I'm honest with her, saying it was nice but I'm starting to feel uncomfortable/irritated about him not planning anything during this trip and keeping me up so late. She offered to have him stay here in the spare room Saturday night, but I just had this feeling in my gut that I did not want him staying with us. I told her I didn't want to, I was not going to offer it to him either, and I think that's when my mom was starting to pick up on my feelings. She drops it, I make myself a coffee, and head off to work.

Sam gets to his event and has a good time, and I am getting really anxious about the original plan; booking an air bnb and staying the night with Sam. As soon as Sam is done at the event and back on the road to my city, I let him know how much anxiety I'm getting about staying the night at an air bnb, because I've NEVER stayed at an air bnb before. He begs me to stay with him, so I just told him I'd think about it. This is around 3 pm, I won't be done with work until about 8. I had already decided in my head I was not going through with the air bnb.

A few hours go by, and I decide to text this to Sam: ""I don't think I can. I really liked the idea of it, but the more I think about it, I'm just too scared. I never used air bnb, I haven't slept in a bed that isn't mine in like 4 years. I can ask my mom again and see if you can stay the night here, but she said we woke her up a couple times last night. Maybe in the future, but I'm just not there yet."" I know, I lied. Honestly, I just really didn‚Äôt want to spend the night with Sam.

His response: ""We gotta work on your anxiety bro cause that's no way to live. Only you can do the work for yourself. It's a matter of if you want it, then you gotta do it. Tough love my guy. I just want to smoke and sleep."" This is where I pretty much just left it until finishing work. He met me there and waited until I was off, gave him his backpack, cleaned up and we headed over to my house again. By the time we had gotten up to my room and started talking about what to do for the night, it was 9:30. He was really pressuring me to still get an air bnb, showing me different listings nearby, but I kept saying no.

At 10:30 we had been going back and forth, and he said he is in a different country, doesn't know anything that's around, and would rather sleep in his car before staying at an air bnb himself, I just kept saying no. We both went quiet for a bit when he was getting really upset and said, ""why can't you just put your anxiety aside for one night?""
I knew for a fact that if we got the air bnb, I was not going to sleep and I would be extremely anxious. I knew we had to find something pet safe because my dog comes everywhere with me, and I wouldn't be able to go the night without her. I felt like I'd still need my space, and this listing had 3 beds. Well... I caved.

The people pleaser in me was overriding, and I picked an air bnb 30 minutes away and we booked it. I saw in the listing that it had the code for the front door  before booking, and was a little weirded out by it, but didn't mention it right away. It's a 3 bedroom, pet safe place with parking and wifi. We got the info and confirmation for the air bnb, packed up some stuff and headed to the car. I texted my mom the address (she knew I didn't want to go), and she texted me back that at any point I want to come home, just sent a message.

At 11, the car was ready, and he handed me the keys to his car, telling me to drive, since he was driving all day and was tired. I didn't want to start anything before spending the night somewhere new, so we got in the car. On the drive, I mentioned the front door access code was in the listing to Sam, and he got really sketched out, messaging the host about it. We ended up calling them to sort out the parking, got that situated, and took our stuff to the house.

We unlock the front door, and see a door in front of us with a key, and a staircase around the right corner. It's a split air bnb; 3 bedroom on the upper level, 3 bedrooms on the lower. We had booked the upper level, not realizing it was a split house, put our stuff down inside, and saw the bulletin for air bnb guests.. No. Pets. Allowed. Sam used the bathroom and came out seeing my worry, but reassured me the posting allows up to 6 people and 1 pet. That helped a bit, but I still had a bad feeling in my gut.

We went outside to smoke, and chatted for a few minutes before heading back in. I walked into the biggest bedroom with some of our stuff, and a spider is hanging from the ceiling right above the bed. I hate spiders, so Sam said he'd open the window and let it outside. It was at this moment we realized the window screen is broken, and the bedroom window doesn't lock. The spider fell, Sam said he ""dealt with it,"" and ""we are sleeping in the same bed now, you don't have a choice anymore.""

I sat on the bed, starting to panic. I listen to these types of stories on scary story podcasts; an air bnb with a stranger, someone breaks in, you get robbed, murdered, or both (Yes I know that's my anxiety talking, but I was starting to spiral at this point). Sam sat on the bed with me, and I started shaking, knots in my stomach. I did not feel safe, I was not staying here. I felt bad for making Sam spend money, and told him I can't stay. He said that if I'm leaving, that he is not comfortable staying here either.

As much as I felt I didn't want him staying at my parents, it is scarier for me to stay at this place than in my own house. I confessed to him that I lied about my mom offering the spare room for him to spend the night. I texted my mom that we weren't sober, and we were too scared to stay the night in the air bnb. I explained about the no pets allowed on the bulletin, the front door, the broken window, and I was having a horrible panic attack about staying the night. Sam was offered the spare bedroom, and my mom said she's on the way.

When I say this was the worst panic attack of my life, believe me. Sam and I sat on the bed talking for 15 minutes, then packed our things up and got tf OUT. We were just going to keep his car there and pick it up in the morning when we were sober again. My mom pulled into the driveway at nearly 1 am, and it wasn't until I opened the door that we saw my dad was also in the car. It was an awkward as hell 30 minute car ride, but we were both so thankful and made sure my parents knew that.

I told my parents I was sorry for keeping them up and telling them I wasn't comfortable with Sam in the house but I was more comfortable knowing he was staying at our house than the air bnb. I told Sam I was sorry I didn't just offer the spare room when it was first offered, and for keeping him up even longer. Sam told my mom that he was sorry for waking her up last night, and I realized I never told either of them I lied about that part (in my mind it was the reason my mom ""said he couldn't use the spare room"" the second night, but I hadn't clarified it to either of them).

My mom responded, ""You didn't wake me up last night?"" And Sam looked at me. I guess my mom saw me freeze and said, ""Oh. Wait. I.. thought it was you guys that woke me up, but I was just really hot last night. I don't think it was you guys."" That's pretty much where conversation dropped between Sam and I, and my parents for the last few minutes of the drive.

My parents were very easygoing with everything and tried to just make light talk with each other to ease the tension in the car. We got back to my parents house, made the bed for Sam and all headed to bed for the night. Sam was dealing with the host complaining about the car staying in the driveway, but when we brought up all our concerns about the air bnb, he shut up pretty quick. I messaged him saying that I was so sorry for lying to him, but he never acknowledged it so I wasn't sure where we were standing.

This morning I woke up with a pounding headache, messaged Sam to make sure he was up, and we took off for his car. He had all his things with him, and said he was just going to head home when he got to his car. Honestly, that was probably for the better since things had been so mucked up the night before, and there was still a lot of tension between us. He got his car, we made sure he was all sorted at a nearby gas station, and I bought him a couple drinks. We hugged and agreed next time we hang out, things definitely have to be planned out better. He started his drive home, and I headed home myself as well, ready for a nap already.

NOW.. I bet the past few paragraphs of this story, you have been confused about my feelings towards Sam. Honestly, so am I. Sam and I have been friends for so long, but I do recognize that some of the things he did this weekend are red flags and really controlling behaviours. I don't know if I want to continue this friendship with Sam, but I am so f-ing lost right now guys. I think I just want to know how other people see this post without being directly involved. My work friend and my sister both think I should ghost him, and my mom thinks I should cut him off.

I WAS still uncomfortable with Sam being in the house and riding in the car with my parents, but I didn't want to tip him off on how I was feeling towards him; the constant pressuring me to get an air bnb knowing how anxious I was, not taking no as an answer after saying it multiple times, not having anything planned and keeping me up until past 2 am on a work night for me, calling my sister ugly? It's been a really hard day trying to understand my feelings and emotions. Please. Help. Give me your input.

I am 31 and single since 7 years out of choice. I just needed to work on myself a lot, so took the long hiatus.

When I was younger, I realized I was dealing with too much mental pain to be in a relationship. Now, I that I am older and having done more work on myself, I felt like I can't find emotionally mature women.

My closest friends are all doctor. My best friend whom I nicknamed Doc Cure Cancer, invited me on a Sunday night. I am GT3 racer, and was done with my night after practicing for an event, I was sore af. So, I didn't want to go, but boy I would have missed it.

I don't drink, but I make the best cocktails in town and cook well too. And once I am behind a table, I forget I am sore or broken, instead I cook like crazy. And there was this girl. A doctor. Someone with a smart mind. And a pair of eyes that were sharper than my professional knives.

I saw her watching me, and I liked that, usually I don't. She smiled when I noticed her and my heart skipped a beat. I was trying to purposely get lemon in my eyes to make an excuse to look at her. Finally, I knew I had to make the move. So, I made myself a virgin strawberry daiquiri and poured it into two cups. And told myself, let's be stupid for 5 minutes....again. :D

I walked up to her, btw, every single horndog was trying to flirt with her all night. Doc Cure Cancer and his lovely wife has been fending them off. I wasn't told this then, but she is the reason, they wanted me to come. Apparently, my friends think we are soulmates. Who knows. . .

I said hi, and she said hi. I offered her the drink, she said she doesn't drink alcohol. I told her, neither do I. She said, it was ""inspiring"" watching me work the counter, and she said that I was doing a good job because most people need a little alcohol to find the courage to talk to the opposite sex, and none of them were getting drunk out of control because of my cocktails.

I don't know where it came from. I replied with, yeah, I often wondered why we need alcohol for courage, your eyes gave me all the courage I needed to walk up to you and ask your name. Mind you, my guts were rumbling since I sat down that, I couldn't even take a sip of my drink. But, somehow, words were being formed :D.

She was taken back, she blushed for a good long minute. And we both couldn't stop laughing. It was 11:45 when I said hi, and we just spoke for hours. I took her to my favorite beach nearby, after the party. Around 4am, I thought we would call it a night and I was about to leave for home. When she asked me if I wanted to watch the sunrise with her at the beach. I told her, I will only agree if I would hold my hands while the sun comes up, she instantly grabbed my hand like a boa constrictor.

I came back home. Snorted a lot of coffee. Worked out. I am not tired, I am not sleepy. BUT I CAN'T STOP SMILING. I CAN'T EVEN WORK!

When I was younger, I would have jumped into sex after 30 seconds because I was too scared to be vulnerable and open to someone. I haven't even hugged this girl, I don't even know her second name for that matter. But, I can see colours reflected from the future when I was with her.

The most recent banners have been released with the livestream confirming that we are getting our wife Skirk in the first half of 5.7 and her banner mate with be Shenhe.  I can not stress this enough, DO NOT PULL SHENHE FOR SKIRK.  Hoyo is trying to triple dip on the Skirk fomo by releasing Shenhe with her but unlike coffee, Shenhe is a complete luxury unit.  She will not be a coffee substitute if you missed her, and she will not greatly improve the strength of your Skirk team.  According to calcs, if you were going to have to choose between adding Shenhe to your team over any 4 star alternative, and pulling Skirks weapon for example, you'd get way better numbers with the weapon. 

Unless you are a giga whale or are just a big fan of Shenhe and don't already have her, I really encourage you to skip her.

1l6ui4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1l6ui4d/morality_and_values_are_inherently_subjective/,Morality and values are inherently subjective,"Going off [this philosophical usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)) for ""subjective"" and ""objective"":

>Something is subjective if it is dependent on a mind (biases, perception, emotions, opinions, imagination, or conscious experience). If a claim is true exclusively when considering the claim from the viewpoint of a sentient being, it is subjectively true. For example, one person may consider the weather to be pleasantly warm, and another person may consider the same weather to be too hot; both views are subjective.

>Something is objective if it can be confirmed independently of a mind. If a claim is true even when considering it outside the viewpoint of a sentient being, then it may be labelled objectively true.

I just made myself a cup of coffee and put it on the kitchen scales. The weight of the mug plus the coffee inside of it is 624 grams.

If I left the mug there and then some all-powerful entity Thanos-snapped every being with a conscious experience out of existence, that kitchen scale would continue showing that reading until the batteries run out, with an occasional tick down as the water in the coffee evaporates and reduces the mass over time.

So the mass of the mug and the coffee inside of it can be confirmed independently of a mind. Those are objective properties of the mug and the coffee.

I value the mug. I mostly value it instrumentally, because I can use that mug to drink coffee. I value the coffee directly, because I enjoy drinking it.

If some all-powerful entity Thanos-snapped me out of existence, the ""I"" in that sentence, the ""me"", would cease to exist. I would from that point no longer be able to value anything. So I would cease to exist, and from my mind vanishing from the world so too would the sense of value my mind finds in the world.

The value I find in the mug and the coffee inside of it can only be confirmed dependent on my mind. Those are subjective properties. As a semantic choice, we could call that either a subjective property of my mind *or* a subjective property of the mug and coffee, depending on how much fluffing around we want to do with the definitions.

I also value the abolition of slavery. Without exception. Yes I know. That's very brave of me. /s

But I do. As a core value, I oppose slavery without exception. I oppose it now, every time it has been implemented in the past, and every way in which it could be implemented in the future.

Like the mug, this is an instrumental value because it is a consequence of some more deeply held values, such as the dignity of the individual and the freedom of all sentient being to pursue a life of flourishing and away from maximal suffering for everyone, yadda yadda yadda.

If some being snapped me out of existence, the sense of value I find in opposition to slavery would cease to exist. But other people hold that value too, so in that sense the value would continue to exist in them. But if that being snapped every being with a mind out of existence, the valuing of opposing slavery would cease to exist in the universe.

The values of opposing slavery and supporting the abolition of slavery is dependent of the minds of the people doing the opposing and supporting. They're subjective.

If we look at the world and observe humans engaged in *doing morality* and describe what we see, what we find is humans getting together, arguing/discussing what moral norms to adopt until a consensus is formed. Then that set of moral norms becomes the standard in that community. From time to time they go back and argue/discuss it some more, and sometimes that leads to changes or subcommunities with different sets of moral norms. Over time the consensus changes.

Descriptively speaking, that's what we see happening. If we look at humans *doing morality* and adjust the utterance ""morality"" to point at what is actually taking place in the world (seems reasonable to me), then by that usage that's what morality is.

The ways in which different groups of people do that process varies from place to place. Sometimes mountains and stone tablets are alleged to be involved. But at its core, morality could either mean the set of norms enacted themselves (i.e. ""a morality"" => ""a moral code"") or it could be the process or school of thought around how moral codes are or should be formed.

A core part of that process involves values, it involves beings with minds, and language, and cultures as the abstraction of the sum total of the worldviews and attitudes of the minds that make up those cultures, and the moral norms enacted and enforced as part of those cultures.

Snap all the conscious minds out of existence, and all of that vanishes from the ground up: Values, thought, discussion, and the norms themselves? All gone.

Therefore: Morality and values are inherently subjective.

# What would convince me that I'm wrong?

Reasonable question! People don't ask it of themselves enough.

Showing this to be false is pretty straightforward. Just like with the mass of the mug earlier, we just need a way to objectively verify that a value or a moral norm could continue to exist in the absence of any conscious experience to hold them. In the case of the mass of the coffee (now half drunk) that can be done through a direct measurement: The kitchen scales slowly counting down as the water evaporates, faithfully reporting that objective mass measurement to a universe bereft of any minds able to appreciate that service.

Problem is that I don't think values or norms are the kind of thing that we can measure in that way. Then again, maybe there is a method and I haven't thought of it yet, so if someone can come up with something, that would be one pathway in to changing my mind.

Setting direct measurement aside, we could do the logic and reason thing, and objectively verify a moral norm or a value the way that we do mathematical statements. It does seem to be the case that, for a robust set of axioms about things like numbers and addition, that 1+1 = 2 is true independently of any conscious being holding that thought in their mind.

But I also struggle with that one, because on some level it would boil down to something like:

1. If you value X, then you ought to do X.
2. You value X.
3. Therefore, you ought to do X.

Obviously that's gratuitously oversimplifying things. But I see *something like this* would be needed in any attempt to do this, and in the absence of the ""You"" in ""You value X"" that makes the premises of the syllogism true (or a ""for all persons"" or ""there exists some person"" or something like that) I just can't see how you could bootstrap something up to get to that conclusion being true.

But like I said with the measurement thing: Just because I can't think of a way to do it, doesn't mean it can't be done. Maybe someone else can work that one out in a way I've not seen before. Open to hearing it if it's a good one.

# Common Objection: Who are you to say...

Whenever I raise this with someone, the common objective seems to be: But what about someone else whose values are that slavery is permissible? If you say slavery is wrong, and they say it is permissible, then who is to say that you are right and they are wrong? How can your claims about slavery being wrong be binding on anyone else if it isn't objective?

Who gets to say that you are right, and the pro-slavery people are wrong?

There's three answers to this.

1. The first is that, even if we suppose the objective morality does exist, that doesn't make it binding or solve the problem of who gets to say what is right or wrong.
   * In the American Civil War, both sides had people who put forward arguments for why their side was correct about slavery being objectively wrong or objectively permissible.
   * Even when both sides agree that God exists and gets to say what is right or wrong, they still disagreed over what God's opinion actually was.
   * That's why it's called the American Civil War, and not the American Civil Debate About The Objective Morality Of Slavery.
   * Supposing objective morality isn't binding on people either, and all it does is push the ""who gets to say"" question back a step to ""who gets to say which objective argument is correct?"" So if that's a problem for subjective morality, then it's a problem for ""objective morality"" too.
2. The second is that I strongly suspect that *most of the time* the people who say that they think slavery is permissible aren't being consistent to their own most deeply held values.
   * It's a little bit like that thing where someone who is a serial cheater in relationships eventually gets cheated on and then condemns cheating without a shred of self-awareness.
   * Working out what your core values actually are and converting those into a set of moral norms that embody those values is really tricky.
   * People have a tendency to act in short-term interest in ways that go against their deeply held values.
   * I think that *in practice* a lot of the time the people who say that slavery is permissible would, if they were willing and able to be really frank and honest about their most deeply held values, have to change their position on slavery.
   * I think that a lot of the squarking pro-slavery people give to things like selectively reading religious texts to justify the view that slavery is permissible is in large part an attempt to silence that part of their own subjectively held values that would otherwise tell them that slavery is wrong.
   * So the second answer is: In practice I think that most of the time, they themselves would say that slavery is wrong if only they were willing/able to be more consistent to their own deeply held values!
3. But even if we suppose *in principle* someone who is pro-slavery in a way that is internally consistent with themselves, the third answer is: We are.
   * If those of us who want to see slavery abolished and stay abolished are to succeed, then the people who want to see slavery continue or increase in prevalence have to fail.
   * The reverse is true for them in their view of us.
   * Where it's possible to persuade someone who is accepting of slavery out of their views, I think that's a good thing.
   * But there *is* a fundamental struggle here, and persuasion isn't going to succeed on everyone.
   * The key problem of that struggle is not *how to objectively justify it*.
   * The key problem of that struggle is *how to win it*.
   * It is indeed the case that the dispassionate view that tries to look at the world from an ""objective"" perspective that has no preference for one subjectively held value over another cannot find a way to justify one or the other.
   * This isn't a sign that there is a flaw in opposing slavery.
   * Rather it is a sign that there is a flaw in that attempt to solve the problem.
   * A bit like asking a physicist to come up with the equations for performing heart surgery, it's not a fundamentally flawed approach, merely the wrong approach for that problem domain.
   * And as described above: Even if an ""objective"" basis for opposing slavery could be provided, that wouldn't make much of a difference in the cause of actually winning that struggle, so it's kind of useless.",1,1749438834.0,DebateReligion,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best RV water filter systems share several critical features, contributing to their effectiveness and user-friendliness.

**Filtration Capacity and Stages**

The filtration capacity‚Äã refers to the total volume of water the system can effectively filter before requiring filter replacement. Multi-stage filtration is crucial for removing a wide spectrum of contaminants. Systems often incorporate sediment filters, carbon filters, and ‚Äãspecialized filters‚Å¢ for removing‚Äç bacteria and heavy metals. A high-capacity system will reduce the frequency of filter changes, but ‚Äåit's essential to‚Äç balance capacity with filtration effectiveness. Stages ‚Å§can range from 1-stage to 4-stage filtration; ‚Äåthe higher the ‚Äãstage, the more filtration levels will be provided, as well as a greater range of removal of sediment, bacteria, contaminants, and heavy‚Äå metals.

**Flow‚Äã Rate**

The ‚Å£flow rate, measured in gallons per minute (GPM), determines ‚Äçhow ‚Äåquickly water can pass through ‚Äåthe‚Äå filter‚Å¢ without significantly reducing water ‚Äãpressure. A sufficient flow rate is vital for comfortable showering‚Äç and efficient use of appliances. Systems with low flow ‚Äçrates can result in frustratingly slow water delivery, ‚Äçwhile systems with higher ‚Äçflow rates ensure adequate water‚Å£ pressure across your RV. Aim ‚Äåfor a flow rate that meets your RV's plumbing demands, typically between 2.5 and 4 GPM for single-RV usage.

**Filter cartridge Lifespan and Replacement**

Filter cartridge lifespan varies depending on the system and the quality‚Äã of the water being filtered. ‚Å£Regular filter replacement is essential for maintaining optimal performance. Some‚Äå systems offer convenient filter replacement indicators, while others rely on a time-based schedule or visual inspection. Consider the cost and ease of acquiring replacement filters when choosing a system. Look for readily‚Å£ available and reasonably priced filter cartridges to minimize ‚Å§long-term operating costs.

**Housing Material and Durability**

The housing material should be robust and resistant to damage from temperature fluctuations and pressure changes. Common materials include BPA-free plastics and stainless steel. A durable housing protects the filter cartridges from physical ‚Å£damage and prevents leaks. Inspect the housing‚Å¢ for quality construction and secure connections to ensure long-term reliability. A system with a sturdy housing will withstand the rigors of‚Å§ RV travel and harsh ‚Å¢environmental conditions.

**Portability and Ease of Installation**

For RV use, portability is essential. Look for systems that are compact‚Äå and easy to connect to your‚Äå water source. Simple‚Äã installation procedures minimize downtime and allow for fast setup at campgrounds. Consider the system's weight and dimensions to ensure it fits comfortably in‚Å¢ your RV's storage compartment. Systems with quick-connect fittings and clear instructions simplify the installation ‚Å£process,even for novice RVers.

**NSF Certification**

NSF International certification indicates that the filter system has been tested and certified to meet specific performance standards for reducing contaminants and improving water quality. Look for NSF certifications for contaminant reduction, material safety, and structural integrity. NSF certification‚Å£ provides assurance ‚Å§that the system performs as advertised and consistently delivers clean and safe water.

## Core Benefits

An RV water filter system‚Å£ offers notable benefits for travelers ‚Å¢seeking‚Äå clean, safe water on the road.

**Health ‚Å¢and safety**

The primary benefit of an RV‚Å£ water filter ‚Äåsystem is the improved health and safety it provides. By ‚Å§removing ‚Å¢harmful bacteria, sediment,‚Å§ chlorine, and other contaminants, these systems ensure that the water you drink, cook with, and shower in is ‚Äçfree from potentially harmful impurities. This peace of ‚Äåmind is especially‚Äã importent when traveling to areas ‚Äãwith questionable water quality.A quality filtration system reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses and protects your family's health on the road.

**Improved Taste and Odor**

RV water sources can often have unpleasant tastes and odors‚Äç due to the presence ‚Å¢of chlorine, sulfur, or other contaminants. A good water filter system removes these impurities,‚Äç resulting in water that tastes and smells significantly ‚Äåbetter.‚Å£ This improves the overall drinking experience and makes it more enjoyable to‚Å§ hydrate while traveling. Clean-tasting water ‚Å§also enhances the flavor of food and beverages, making meals more ‚Å§enjoyable on the road.

**Protection of RV Plumbing**

Sediment, minerals, and other particles in unfiltered water can accumulate in your RV's‚Äç plumbing‚Å£ system, leading to clogs, corrosion, and reduced water pressure. A water filter system protects your RV's pipes and appliances by removing these particles before they can cause damage. This prolongs the‚Å£ lifespan of ‚Äåyour plumbing system and reduces the need for costly repairs. Protect‚Å§ your RV by filtering every ‚Å£incoming water source.

**Extended Appliance Lifespan**

hard water and sediment can‚Äç damage water-using appliances in your RV, such as water heaters, washing‚Äã machines, and coffee makers. By filtering out these harmful substances, a water filter system helps extend the lifespan of your ‚Äåappliances and‚Äã maintains their efficiency. This saves you money on replacement‚Å¢ costs ‚Å¢and‚Äã ensures that your appliances perform optimally for years to come.

**Cost Savings**

While there is an initial investment in an RV water filter system,it‚Å§ can ‚Å¢lead to long-term cost ‚Å§savings by ‚Å¢reducing the need‚Å§ to purchase bottled water,preventing plumbing repairs,and extending the‚Å£ lifespan of appliances. Bottled water becomes expensive over time, especially for full-time RVers. A‚Å§ water filter system‚Å§ provides a enduring‚Äç and cost-effective solution for accessing clean drinking water on the‚Å£ road.

## ‚ÄåFAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked‚Äã questions about RV water filter systems.

**How often should I replace my RV water filter cartridge?**

the‚Å¢ recommended filter replacement frequency ‚Å¢depends on‚Å¢ the‚Äã specific system and the quality of the water being filtered.Most manufacturers recommend replacing‚Å§ filters ‚Äçevery 3 to ‚Å§6 months, or‚Äå after a certain number of gallons have been‚Å§ filtered. Regularly check the filter for signs of clogging or reduced performance,‚Å£ and replace it as needed.

**Can I use an‚Äã RV‚Å§ water ‚Äåfilter system for‚Äå well water?**

Yes, but it's important‚Äç to choose a system that‚Å§ is ‚Å£specifically designed for well water. Well water frequently enough contains higher levels of sediment, iron, and bacteria than city water. Look for‚Äç a ‚Å£system with a‚Å§ multi-stage‚Å¢ filtration‚Å£ process that includes sediment filtration, iron reduction, and‚Å£ disinfection capabilities. Regular testing of‚Å£ your well water is ‚Äçalso recommended‚Å£ to ensure that the ‚Äçfilter system is effectively removing contaminants.

**What is the difference between a whole-house and an inline RV water filter?**

A whole-house RV water ‚Äçfilter is‚Å¢ installed at the main water inlet and filters all the water entering the RV. An inline‚Å¢ filter is connected to the water‚Äã hose between the water ‚Äåsource and the RV. Whole-house systems ‚Äåoffer comprehensive filtration for all water uses, while inline filters are more portable‚Å¢ and easier to install. The choice depends on your specific needs ‚Å§and preferences; if you prefer to only filter water for ‚Å§drinking, bathing, and cooking, an‚Å£ inline rv ‚Å¢water filter will suffice.

**Does an RV water filter remove viruses?**

Most standard RV water filters do not remove viruses. To remove viruses, you need a filter system that includes ‚Å§a disinfection‚Å£ stage, such as ultraviolet (UV) sterilization or a filter specifically designed ‚Äçto remove viruses.These types of systems are more expensive and may require‚Äã additional power; however, they can provide‚Å£ an extra level of protection against waterborne pathogens.

June 6, 2025: The clock struck 12 and I turned 25. I was anticipating a lot of birthday greetings and messages from my friends and family. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to hear from V because we ended our relationship on terrible terms. In fact, she was the first person to send birthday wishes my way. I don‚Äôt want to address V as my ex. I still consider her my woman.

I called V at 3:30 am, the only time she gets to be peaceful because she has a lot of situations going on with her lately. I spoke to her for 2 hours. I wept, and she did too. I told her that I need her and yes, I actually do. She hung up the call and sent me a message that read, ‚ÄúCould you work from home today? I want to come meet you.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúOkay. I will,‚Äù as I was wiping my tears with my hands. We decided to meet somewhere private.

I was yearning for a day like this. I brought breakfast for the two of us. I was keenly listening to the movement of the elevator, keeping the door ajar, strolling from one corner to the other. 

There she was, right in front of my eye, a surreal moment. I was shivering. I held her hands. I embraced her and the moment. I kissed her all over the face. I saw her up close after 2 long months; the sight I‚Äôll never forget.

We caught up from where we left off. I was jumping around with joy. I showed her my work progress and a few other things I‚Äôd been up to. She was happy about it, but there was a hidden grimace on her face. She shared everything that‚Äôs been happening with her. She is going through a lot, and yet she remains intact and takes care of her sibling and her mom.

I thought V wanted to get back together when she suggested that we meet, but she said she was with me only because she didn‚Äôt want me to be alone on my birthday. V had her reasons to end our relationship ‚Äî valid ones ‚Äî but I want her real bad. When I told her that I want to make things right, she said she doesn‚Äôt have anything to give me because she‚Äôs become numb and burned out from what she‚Äôs been going through. She said she can never get back with me. At the end of the day, I talked her into at least giving it a thought ‚Äî no matter how long it takes for her to reach a decision.

I want V for myself. I can‚Äôt lose her to someone else like in the movies, meeting after decades and sitting together, taking a trip down memory lane to laugh and cry at the moments we had when we were together. I'd rather prefer to remember those times over coffee on our lawn in the evening. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll come back to me. The two of us are equally hurt, but I want to give our relationship another chance.

V, if you're reading this, just remember that all the worries you have now will pass. I want to stand next to you, but you won‚Äôt let me do that. I believe you're strong enough to fight them all alone, but if you ever need me, I‚Äôll come to you. I find my solace in you

Love,
-H

I started reading this subreddit posts before I even began my PMP journey, and they helped me plan realistically. I initially gave myself 6 months, with this timeline in mind:
	‚Ä¢	1 month for the 35 PDU course
	‚Ä¢	2 months for Study Hall practice
	‚Ä¢	Then book the exam (expecting a 2‚Äì3 month wait) and keep practicing until the test date.

But things moved faster than expected.

I started with Andrew Ramdayal‚Äôs Udemy course, and it was way more flowy than I imagined. I was able to finish it in just 10 days, watching lectures for 2‚Äì3 hours a day. One hour each during my morning and evening commute to work another 30-60mins before bed at night. 

Right after, I dove into Study Hall. daily mini-quizzes before and after work. I also watched David McLachlan‚Äôs YouTube videos during my lunch breaks. 
That‚Äôs all you need. AR+DM+SH. 
AR and DM help to get your foundation strong while SH prepares you for the real exam. One wouldn‚Äôt work without the other. 

Weekends were for full-length SH mock exams.
My first full mock was brutal. I ran out of time and ended up scoring only 59%. I was mentally exhausted and couldn‚Äôt even process the last 20-30 questions. Spent the whole day feeling defeated. I realized it was a really long time since I spent a continuous 3 hours writing an exam. And my brain was not prepared for it ü•≤.
Back to Reddit I went, for encouragement and strategies. That‚Äôs when I realized: taking the exam the right way is just as important as knowing the stuff.

So, the following weekend, I approached it differently.
Simulated the exact exam conditions: same time blocks, scheduled breaks, even prepped a thermos of coffee and a bottle of water. My break routine:
	‚Ä¢	100 ml water
	‚Ä¢	Quick restroom break
	‚Ä¢	150 ml hot coffee
	‚Ä¢	Deep breaths for 2 minutes
All under 10 minutes.

That mental and physical reset made a difference.  A huge difference! From then on, I could score 75-85 consistently in the next 4 full mocks.

Once I completed all 5 SH+ mocks, I went to book my exam, expecting a 2‚Äì3 month wait. But there was a slot in 2 days üò≥.
Though I‚Äôm the over-preparing type, I knew extending this any further would only burn me out. So I took the leap. Booked it. 
I carried the thermos with hot coffee and a 500ml water bottle. Kept them in the locker. Followed the same break routine. 

That moment when the lady in front desk took out the print from the printer and gave it to me: it felt surreal. 

And‚Ä¶ AT in all domains! What a relief üòÖ 


It‚Äôs been a couple of months now. I had to go right back to the chaos of my life but.. Reddit played a huge role in my journey, so I wanted to pay it forward. So here I am, though a little late. 

If you‚Äôre juggling work, family and life chaos and wondering if it‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶.yes, it is! One focused step at a time. Simulate the real exam. Practice smart. And take that leap. You got this.

**Coda: The curious case of Tammy Leakey ‚Äì March 12, 1981**

\[ Information Gathered from: [https://theresaallore.com/2016/03/24/coda-the-curious-case-of-tammy-leakey-march-12-1981/](https://theresaallore.com/2016/03/24/coda-the-curious-case-of-tammy-leakey-march-12-1981/) \]

A lot of information on the internet derives from the above article published in the Montreal Gazette, I believe in 1982. It gets a lot of the case details right, but in some cases it gets the information wrong. Here‚Äôs a run-down:

Tammy Leakey lived with her mother in an apartment at¬†¬†339 5th avenue in Verdun. Her parents were divorced. ¬†On Thursday evening, March 12th, Tammy‚Äôs mother went to visit a friend in Point Saint Charles for coffee. Betty Leakey brings her daughters along with her, Tammy age 12, and Donna age 8. The friend, Bonnie Tapp, lives on¬†Ryde street in Point Saint Charles. The distance is approximately a 10 minute drive, or 40 minute walk between Verdon and Point Saint Charles.

https://preview.redd.it/igea3m9ugt5f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bba4e2c6fe75e00dae18cae9a0d1e952d856924

By 9:20 pm, Tammy hasn‚Äôt returned. Betty Leakey and Bonnie Tapp are worried, Tapp¬†proceeds to the depanneur. The owner says that Tammy came to the shop, bought milk and chocolate, and left around 9:05 pm. Walking back to her apartment, Tapp sees in the gutter a brown bag containing milk and a chocolate bar, and Tammy‚Äôs glasses in front of 2340 Ryde street. (in some version it is this guy in the photo who found the items in the gutter) The time is approximately 9:25 pm.

Betty Leakey and Bonnie Tapp decide to canvass the neighborhood. At approximately 9:30 pm they knock on the apartment door at 2340 Ryde street, the home of Eve Renauld. Renauld tells them that she had just seen a man in a beige trench-coat get out of a small red car and force a young girl, screaming and yelling, into it.

https://preview.redd.it/2m2yt4cygt5f1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7226703821663b6dd9c8b738b862c957cb2bbdd

**Discovery of the body**

At approximately¬†10:45 pm on the same evening,¬†March 12, 1981, 73-year-old Ewing Tait is driving along Lindsay street in Dorval‚Äôs industrial park when he notices¬†‚Äúsomething in the field along side the road‚Äù.

What he first thinks are rags is actually clothing. He stops and discovers the body of a young child, lying on her stomach with arms outstretched. The body is still warm. The police are notified, and Tammy Leakey is taken to the Lachine General Hospital. At the hospital she is pronounced dead on arrival. Cause of death: strangulation.

The lead investigators on the case were SD Maurice Chartrand and Roland Ouimet of the MUC police. The autopsy was performed by Theresa Sourour under the assistance of Andre Lauzon. Tammy was strangled with a length of rope or electrical wire. Recovered at the scene were her blue jeans, jean jacket (which contained a chocolate bar in the pocket), pink underwear, white stockings, and one ‚Äì¬†only one¬†‚Äì blue shoe.

**Aftermath**

A year after the disappearance the Point Saint Charles community was not happy with the level of police service they were receiving (see article above). People complained that the Longueuil police were not doing enough to solve the crime, and that the safety of children was at risk. MUC police spokesman Norm Couillard tells the community that MUC police are¬†*‚Äútoo busy trying to solve this year‚Äôs cases‚Äù*¬†(the article dryly notes that none of the 1981 cases were solved). ¬†Robert Cote, the district commander for The Point, tries to assure the community that there‚Äôs a¬†*‚Äúgood chance‚Äù*¬†the Leakey case will be solved.¬†*‚ÄúNo case is ever closed. There is no statute of limitations for murder‚Äù*, Cote argues. 

Then why is there an unspoken statute of limitations on evidence retention?¬†

Well, you get my point, this is sounding all too familiar.

**Some additional thoughts**

The most striking thing is the extraordinary compression of time between disappearance and discovery: it is about 90 minutes. In no other case do we see such an accelerated passing of events.

Think about it: Leakey is last seen at 9:05 in the depanneur. Give a couple of minutes to be abducted in front of the Ryde street apartment. She‚Äôs found at about 10:45 pm on Lindsay street in Dorval, that‚Äôs at least a 20 minute car ride from Ryde. The perpetrator had approximately 1 hour to conduct their business and strangle Leakey before leaving her in Dorval.

Here‚Äôs another thing. I don‚Äôt believe Leakey was stalked. Leakey‚Äôs mother traveled from Verdun to PSC to visit her friend. No one in The Point knew Tammy Leakey. This was an incredibly high-risk crime of opportunity, a snatch-and-run, very similar to the Sharron Prior snatch-and-run.

And while we are on the subject of Sharron Prior. Yes, Leakey‚Äôs abduction point is approximately 2 blocks from the point where Sharron Prior was abducted in 1975. ¬†But Prior was raped, Leakey was not.

What do we make of that? Leakey was 4‚Äô10‚Äù, 88 lbs. Prior was 5‚Äô3‚Ä≥ 103 lbs. It was late at night. Did the perpetrator later realize that Leakey was much younger and abandon plans? Did something change?

What do we make of one shoe being missing? Haven‚Äôt we seen peculiarities with shoes in the other cases? Camirand: missing boots. Hawkes; shoes dumped on a side street. Monast: socks neatly placed in shoes. Bazinet: one shoe missing. Allore: Chinese slippers missing.

And what about the description of the car?¬† Eve Renauld describes a man in a beige trench-coat with¬†*a¬†small red car.*¬†The tire tracks at the Louise Camirand site tell us it was¬†*also a small car*: a Renault, Toyota or Mini-Austin.

**Tammy Leakey was not found in a field**

Contrary to news reports Tammy Leakey was not found in a field. She was found on the curb, to the side of the road of Lindsay Street, as the following crime scene map demonstrates:

https://preview.redd.it/5we5uojght5f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d421163cda75efb258cc91083344bd244084570

And those 4 points along the sidewalk? Those mark where blood was found. In addition to being strangled, Tammy was beaten about the head and her back. Here‚Äôs a police photo from the crime scene:

https://preview.redd.it/llzgxv4kht5f1.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=421a4be312501afba36c241680337e6bf045d954

So Tammy Leakey wasn‚Äôt dragged into a field. She was abandoned at the side of the road. I would guess that the perpetrator knew the location before hand where they dumped her: you just don‚Äôt wander into the industrial section of Dorval.

[So who do we know that might have known that section of town? Well there‚Äôs the ‚ÄúChateauguay Killer‚Äù. As we pointed out earlier, MX worked¬†at¬†Record Tools, LTD which¬†is about a 10 minute drive from 890 Lindsay street, where Tammy Leakey was found.¬†](http://theresaallore.com/2016/03/sharon-prior-and-the-chateauguay-killer-part-2/)¬†What we don‚Äôt know is whether MX was out on parole at this point. We only know that he served a very minimum sentence for the murders of Norma O‚ÄôBrien and Debbie Fisher.

Here‚Äôs another peculiar thing. One of the lead investigating officers on the Leakey case shares the same last name with the ‚ÄúChateauguay Killer‚Äù. Similarly,¬†[one of the lead investigating officers on the Prior case shares the same last name as the 7 brothers who recently appeared in a Longueuil court on sex crime charges dating back to 1964 ‚Äì 1976 in the Longueuil area.¬†](http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/seven-brothers-charged-in-decades-old-sexual-assault-1.2702491)Now they are both common names, and I don‚Äôt want to create a panic over nothing, but with these 2 cases still unresolved after 35-plus years? I would be looking into every angle, including collusion.

She had started dreaming of the sea again weeks ago.

Not just waves or storms‚Äîbut of a city, vast and sunken. Black coral and impossible angles. Her mother‚Äôs face, sewn shut and smiling. In the dreams, the water wasn‚Äôt cold. It was alive. Watching. Calling.

She‚Äôd woken one night choking on saltwater that wasn‚Äôt there.  
The next morning, the funding was approved.  
And now, she was back.

Dr. Lena Coyle hadn‚Äôt seen the sea in fifteen years.  
It hadn‚Äôt missed her.

The van creaked to a stop at the edge of Kingsport Hollow, its rusted sign barely legible through the salt-stained windshield. *Population: 874*, it still read, though Lena had a creeping suspicion that number was a lie. The road wound through brined pines and weather-worn cottages, their shingles blackened by damp years, their windows fogged from within like breath on a mirror.

She rolled down the window, instantly regretting it. The air hit her like a soaked rag‚Äîwet, thick, and rancid with the scent of rotting fish, mildew, and something else. Something coppery and sweet. Something like open wounds.

She was home.

The year was 2023, but Kingsport Hollow had never belonged to time. Her phone had no signal. Her GPS froze ten miles outside town. That was expected.  
It was all expected. Part of her had known that coming back meant entering a place that didn‚Äôt obey the same rules‚Äîof time, of science, of sense.

Lena stepped out, boots crunching on gravel. The sea roared beyond a row of shingled homes, hidden behind a curtain of fog that rolled in off the tide like a living thing. It swallowed the horizon. Swallowed time. There were faces in the mist, or maybe just memories. She pulled her coat tight, but the cold still found her‚Äîslipping through the fabric, curling into her bones like needles.

She hadn‚Äôt wanted to come back.  
But she had no choice.

The grant had been too good to ignore‚Äîgenerous backing from the Department of Oceanic Preservation to investigate seismic anomalies off the New England coast. Lena had proposed a two-week solo dive, citing sonar scans, bioluminescent pattern mapping, coral decay analysis. The language of the proposal was clinical. Safe. Logical. But the real reason‚Äîthe unspoken reason‚Äîwas personal.  
Something had shifted beneath Kingsport Hollow. And part of her needed to know what.

She passed the hollow shell of her old elementary school. The mural of ocean creatures she helped paint in third grade was now half-submerged in ivy, the orca's smile peeling into a snarl. She remembered the aquarium field trip, how she‚Äôd fainted in front of the squid tank. The doctor said it was low blood sugar.

But she remembered what she‚Äôd seen: eyes where there shouldn‚Äôt have been eyes. Tentacles moving in deliberate, reverent patterns. Her teacher, Mr. Beck, never let her near the tanks again. He disappeared two weeks later.

Her father never believed in coincidence.

She parked beside her childhood home. The porch sagged. The windows were black. The wood warped like it had been breathing in her absence. The wind slipped through the loose slats, and for a moment, she swore she heard her name whispered in the gust.

She hesitated before turning the key‚Äîhalf expecting resistance. But the door opened smoothly.  
Almost welcoming.

Inside, the air was dense. Heavy with memory. Her father‚Äôs books still lined the shelves, their spines bowed and bloated from humidity. Dust coated everything like a shroud. The furniture sagged beneath it.

She moved through the house like a trespasser in sacred ground.  
The kitchen still held her mother‚Äôs apron, faded and thin, hanging limp like dead skin. A cracked coffee cup sat in the sink‚Äîclean, inexplicably.  
The hallway mirror reflected her in a haze, her face briefly replaced with something else‚Äîsomething thinner. Translucent. Not entirely her.

In the basement sat the old chest freezer. Shut. Chained. Locked. She touched it briefly and recoiled at the heat. Not warmth‚Äî**heat**. Like something alive.

Her bedroom was stripped bare. Only the bedframe remained, and the ghost of posters long peeled from the walls. She stood in the middle of the room, feeling the weight of her younger self.

The girl who found her mother washed up on the beach.

They said it was an accident. Slipped on the rocks. Drowned.  
But Lena remembered the torn lips. The barnacles. The way her mother‚Äôs eyes had stared, wide and empty, like something had left her long before the tide did.

Her father had never recovered. He locked the basement. Whispered in strange rhythms. Stopped going near the water.  
He died six years later. Aneurysm, they said. She hadn‚Äôt come back for the funeral. She hadn‚Äôt opened the letters the town sent. She hadn‚Äôt responded when the journal arrived.

That journal now sat in her pack. Still unopened.  
She hadn‚Äôt dared.

She‚Äôd devoted her life to science. To logic. To data. Marine biology gave her structure‚Äîlabels, rules, taxonomies. It let her name the things in the dark.  
But some things defied naming.

That night, she sat at her father‚Äôs desk. Water-stained maps spread around her. Coordinates marked with Xs that didn‚Äôt exist on NOAA charts. The tremor logs showed a pattern. A pulse.  
A rhythm.

Like breathing.

She traced the most recent anomaly and her finger landed squarely on Kingsport Hollow.

She shut the notebook and turned out the lamp.

Sleep came slowly. The house groaned like a ship lost at sea. Something tapped beneath the floorboards. Something waited.

In her dreams, she walked the shoreline. Her mother‚Äôs body lay face-down in the surf. But when Lena turned her over, it was her own face staring back‚Äîeyes open, mouth moving without sound.

She woke gasping.

A hand tapped her shoulder.

‚ÄúTide brought you back, Dr. Coyle.‚Äù

Old Caleb stood behind her like a statue shaped from coral and bone. His clothes hung in tatters, soaked but spotless. One eye was milky, the other sharp as glass. His skin looked stretched too tight‚Äîlike it was trying to remember how to be human.

‚ÄúShe never forgets her own.‚Äù

Lena nodded. Caleb had worked the docks when she was a child. A background fixture, always muttering, always smelling of salt and blood. He hadn‚Äôt changed. Not in fifteen years. Not a single inch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for research,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTwo weeks. In and out.‚Äù

Caleb smiled. There were too many teeth. Some didn‚Äôt belong in a human mouth.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they all say.‚Äù

He turned and walked down the road. His footsteps made no sound. The fog swallowed him like a door closing.

Lena stood there, her legs refusing to move. She looked toward the sea.  
The tide had come in early.  
The moon hung veiled in cloud, casting the whole town in bruised blue light.

She didn‚Äôt remember going back inside.  
But she woke in her bed.  
The journal open beside her.

And a single wet footprint on the floor.

**The next morning**, Lena stood barefoot at the edge of the beach, staring into the churn.  
The ocean had always unnerved her, even before everything. The way it moved with purpose. The way it listened.  
It wasn‚Äôt just water.  
It was memory.

She watched the surf foam and collapse. Again and again. It felt like the sea was breathing in tandem with her. Syncing to her.

A memory rose: her mother, waist-deep in the tide, whispering to the waves. Lena had been five.

‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù she‚Äôd asked.

Her mother hadn‚Äôt turned.  
‚ÄúTo the part of me that never came back.‚Äù

That was the last full summer before the end.

Now Lena stood in the same spot. The waves lapped against her boots, murmuring secrets she‚Äôd tried her whole life not to understand.

She knelt and ran her hand through the surf.

A seashell pressed into her palm. But it wasn‚Äôt a shell.

It was a tooth.

She closed her fingers around it and whispered without thinking‚Äî

‚ÄúI remember you.‚Äù

And the sea answered‚Äîby growing still.

It was not only so beautiful and amazingly delicious, it tasted like pure joy?? I was so happy sitting on a patio with friends in the sun sipping my fancy iced drink. This is significant bc I‚Äôve been in a depressy fog for months and this joy was incandescent.

But the real magic is that I was so focused and productive all day, got a million chores done. It reminded me of the first day I started methylphenidate, like‚Ä¶ *woah‚Ä¶ I know kung fu* (please someone get this reference!)

I did a bunch of reading and research last night about matcha and learned by accident about how matcha is rich in l-theamine and how many of you supplement for adhd with that! I got so excited and obsessed with it that I drove across town to get the exact same drink today, and while I had a v busy and stressful morning, I experienced the *same* results, of feeling calm and focused and motivated all day. *wild*

What I think is very interesting on top of all this is that normally caffeine does not agree with me‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt handle coffee at all, but methylphenidate (20mg) feels good and I can have one green tea a day without too much jitters or anxiety. So I was surprised to read that matcha has much more caffeine than brewed tea! 

Anyway I‚Äôm just SO STOKED about the mood stability and energetic focus I had this weekend, and all the chores I got done. I cleaned out under my porch, pals! I grocery shopped, laundry, cooked multiple meals, rearranged furniture, gardened, did all the things!

1l6u3hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1l6u3hn/setting_the_record_straight_the_owners_of_eden/,Setting the record straight- The Owners of Eden Coffee and Co,"Over the past week, we‚Äôve been the target of a growing conspiracy rooted in false allegations. Accusations of racism, transphobia, antisemitism, and more, all stemming from a Twitter account that we no longer control. We‚Äôre making this post to finally address and debunk the misinformation that continues to circulate on this subreddit.

We first became aware of the situation when hateful comments and messages began flooding our social media. Confused and deeply alarmed, we tried to reason with people, hoping to understand where it was all coming from. Then we found the Reddit post.

To say we were appalled would be an understatement.

We saw wild claims based on tweets from an account that, yes, used to be linked to my husband Jordan. And we understand why it looks the way it does. We truly do. If we saw what you saw without context, we would be upset too. So here‚Äôs the truth.

Before opening our caf√©, Jordan had a past life online where he created adult content. He built a large following on Twitter as part of that work. But with time, he made a personal and professional decision to leave that behind to start fresh and build something more meaningful. As part of that transition, he sold the Twitter account to an anonymous buyer through a legitimate online marketplace.

What we didn‚Äôt know is what that account would later become. A platform for hate, bigotry, and propaganda. We are horrified by what it turned into and want to be very clear. We do not support or condone any of the views posted on that account. We‚Äôve contacted the marketplace where the account was sold and have tried to get in touch with the new owner, but unfortunately, there‚Äôs only so much we can do.

We‚Äôve also reached out to moderators of this subreddit to explain the situation and provide clarity. At first, we tried to respond to every message, every hateful comment, but eventually, we had to start blocking and deleting just to protect our mental health. We‚Äôve sent direct messages with proof of everything stated here, and the users who posted the thread kindly deleted them.

Let us be absolutely clear. This is not who we are, and it never has been. We do not condone hatred of any of the groups listed and are committed to serving and stewarding our community with our passions.

So let us reintroduce ourselves.

My name is Lyuba. I grew up in Rochester after my parents immigrated us to the United States. This city has always meant the world to me. The culture, the connection, the coffee. Even after I moved to Nashville and met Jordan, Rochester stayed in my heart. Together, we dreamed of opening a caf√© rooted in warmth, community, and love. We brought that dream back here because this is where it felt right. 

At the end of the day, we just want to create a peaceful, inclusive space where anyone can feel at home. If you have questions or concerns, we invite you to reach out to us directly. We‚Äôre here. And we truly hope you‚Äôll give us the chance to show you who we really are.

We love this community, and we love you, exactly as you are.

With care,
Lyuba and Jordan

[this is a repost, my previous account got nuked. Meaty and Wendi, be as critical as you want, it will definitely be funny if I made you crash out üòÇ]

Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it‚Äôs yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it‚Äôs a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I‚Äôd like and she‚Äôd get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn‚Äôt evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn‚Äôt terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I‚Äôd soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn‚Äôt hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

‚ÄúWhat can I get you?,‚Äù she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn‚Äôt sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

‚ÄúCould I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn‚Äôt speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn‚Äôt place right away. It was oddly‚Ä¶.metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

‚ÄúGood time for a late night meal, huh?‚Äù The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress‚Äôs, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I‚Äôd seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I‚Äôd seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That‚Äôs when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. ‚ÄúSaw yer plates,‚Äù he said, motioning to the window. ‚ÄúOut of state. You‚Äôre new here, aren‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen about six months,‚Äù I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I‚Äôm here every night, and I ain‚Äôt ever seen you.‚Äù He was right. I‚Äôd never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it‚Äôs uncomfortable atmosphere. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna stare, son. You‚Äôre out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin‚Äô back black coffee. We don‚Äôt do cream ‚Äòn sugar, you‚Äôll just have to mature a bit.‚Äù

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn‚Äôt there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

‚ÄúSyrup?,‚Äù she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn‚Äôt ordered that. ‚ÄúOh, this is--‚Äù

‚ÄúAll we got,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúSyrup or not?‚Äù

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House‚Äôs-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. ‚ÄúShut the fuck up dude-- don‚Äôt you see that!?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?,‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúOh, hush boy.‚Äù His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. ‚ÄúYour mind‚Äôs playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don‚Äôt ya sit awhile and relax some?‚Äù

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

‚ÄúAh, come on!,‚Äù the man teased. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôd be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‚Äòround here! C‚Äômon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

‚ÄúThey say these woods are haunted,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

‚ÄúThe shadows yer seeing, they ain‚Äôt real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain‚Äôt no ghosties. There‚Äôs weird people.‚Äù

No shit. I‚Äôm sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. ‚ÄúYanno, you‚Äôd make a fine lookin‚Äô corpse, Hollywood.‚Äù

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn‚Äôt mean I was from Hollywood. I‚Äôd never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

‚ÄúNot a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you‚Äôre one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that‚Äôs like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?‚Äù

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There‚Äôs a few families in them there woods, families I won‚Äôt ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--‚Äù His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren‚Äôt raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. ‚ÄúThat there‚Äôs one of em,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou sit tight, pretty boy.‚Äù

I had a chance to escape then, as he‚Äôd gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn‚Äôt want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

‚ÄúWell, shoot, Todd I ain‚Äôt seen ya in, shit, how long‚Äôs it been now?‚Äù Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

‚ÄúNot since our Brodie went missin‚Äô,‚Äù Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ‚Äòbout six months.‚Äù

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. ‚ÄúYou looks a lot like my Brodie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wanna be Brodie?‚Äù

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. ‚ÄúNow, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don‚Äôt want him.‚Äù

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd‚Äôs voice warned me not to. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna go out there right now. Mama‚Äôs out, ‚Äòn she‚Äôs in one of her moods. She‚Äôs been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.‚Äù

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. ‚ÄúYou gotta ride it out. Yer family can‚Äôt keep doin‚Äô this.‚Äù His voice dropped to a hush. ‚ÄúOne of these days, someone‚Äôs gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin‚Äô, all these missin‚Äô boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.‚Äù

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt try it!,‚Äù Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, ‚ÄúYou gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?‚Äù She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I‚Äôd stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you‚Äôd see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I‚Äôd seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person‚Äôs flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie‚Äôs flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker‚Äôs dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama‚Äôs in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that‚Äôs not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That‚Äôs how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

‚ÄúCome on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,‚Äù she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

‚ÄúYou'd make a lovely corpse!,‚Äù she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator‚Äôs, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

I think biohackers are going to love how insane and insanely useful, this prompt is.

If you're serious about biohacking using diet, aesthetics, performance, and long-term health, this ChatGPT prompt builds 7-day meal plans that go far beyond macros. It mimics a licensed clinical dietitian, using IOM nutrient targets, protein quality (DIAAS), micronutrient timing, absorption enhancers, and even mTOR-based amino acid triggers. Fully customizable for goals (cut, bulk, recomp), medical conditions (PCOS, prediabetes), cuisine, food preferences, cooking skill, and budget. It doesn‚Äôt just give meals, it engineers your diet with precision.

It also balances incomplete amino acids in plant based proteins via amino acid balancing (using plant proteins with complementary amino acid profile), making your protein complete.

Doesn't matter if you are vegan or vegetarian this can help everyone.

Even if you know the science behind this, doing it by hand might be too tedious and changing it on fly as your fitness goal or energy demands change, lots of work! 

‚ö†Ô∏è As always with AI, sanity-check the output and verify, while it follows clinical logic, occasional hallucinations or mismatches can occur. **Use it at your own risk** and **please consult a real clinical dietician if you've chronic illness or serious health issues.**

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a table with runner depends greatly on the technical specifications of both components.The table's construction, material, and dimensions are paramount, as is the runner's fabric, design, and care requirements.

**Table Material and Construction:** The strength and visual appeal of the table are heavily influenced by the material used in its construction. Solid wood tables, such as oak or maple, offer extraordinary durability and a classic aesthetic, withstanding years of use. Metal tables, often made of stainless steel or wrought iron, provide a modern, industrial look and are highly resistant to damage. Engineered wood, like MDF or plywood, offers a more affordable option while still providing a stable surface; though, they may not be as resistant to moisture or heavy impacts.

**Table Dimensions and Shape:** The dimensions of the table should correspond appropriately to the dimensions/space available and/or practical requirements for its end purpose. A large rectangular dining table may be the centerpiece for a big dining room setting, while a smaller round table could suit a breakfast nook. The height of the table is also notable, especially if it's intended for eating or working, around 30 inches/76 cm is the standard height for dining tables. Coffee tables are lower, typically ranging from 16 to 18 inches/40-45 cm.

**Runner Material and Design:** Table runners are frequently enough made up of cotton, linen, polyester, or blends of these materials. Runner designs can range from simple/minimalist solid colors to elaborately patterned or textured fabrics. Cotton/linen runners are absorbent and easy to care for, while polyester runners are more resistant to stains and wrinkles.

**Runner Dimensions and Drop:** The runner should be sized to appropriately correlate with the table's dimensions, with an appropriate amount of 'drop' on either side. ""Drop"" refers to the length of the runner that hangs over the edges of the table. A standard drop is between 6 to 12 inches on each end, but some prefer a longer drop for formal settings.

Key features to look for in a table with a runner include:

* Durable table construction
* Appropriately sized table dimensions
* High-quality runner material
* Design compatibility between table and runner
* Easy maintenance of both table and runner

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen table with a runner brings a myriad of benefits to a home. It provides functional utility, and elevates the aesthetic of the space.

**Surface Protection:** The runner acts as a protective barrier, shielding the table surface from scratches, spills, and heat damage. Especially critically important for dining sets where accidental drink spillages and high-heat serving dishes can damage the delicate table finish without a runner. Many such tables can last years and years more by simply preventing inevitable damage.

**Versatile Styling:** Table runners are easily interchangeable, enabling versatile styling options for different occasions and seasons. Swapping out a neutral runner for a festive one can instantly transform a dining table for holiday gatherings, while opting for a minimalist runner can streamline a workspace for maximum productivity. The ability to customize the look of the table quickly and effortlessly adds a dynamic element to any room.

Consumers frequently enough have questions regarding the compatibility of tables and runners, the care requirements, and the best ways to style them.

**What size runner should I get for my table?**
The ideal runner size depends on the table's dimensions and the desired drop length. To determine the correct runner length, measure the table's length and add twice the desired drop length. The width of the runner should be proportional to the table's width, leaving enough space on either side for place settings or decorative items.

**How do I care for my table runner?**
The care instructions vary depending on the runner's material. Cotton and linen runners can typically be machine-washable in cold water, while delicate fabrics like silk or lace may require hand-washing or dry cleaning. Always check the manufacturer's label for specific care instructions to prevent damage or shrinkage.

Now, we get to the programming. I'll be working on special attacks for Luigi (charged and special). His charged shot could be a hammer swing (should be easy enough to program hopefully) and his special will be a thunder attack forward (this attack is balanced by having a cooldown).

And finally after all that, I may work on powerups to function as Megaman crosses but I'll jump that bridge when I get to it lol, I still haven't studied how they function",25,1749436990.0,BattleNetwork,1,0.97,False

Most of my life is spoken for. The days are full, the calendar‚Äôs set, and there‚Äôs someone who knows what kind of coffee I drink. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the nights aren‚Äôt quiet in a way that aches sometimes.

I‚Äôm tattooed, bearded, probably overthink everything, and tend to show up in people‚Äôs messages like a voice memo you didn‚Äôt know you needed. If you‚Äôre someone who writes like you mean it, or misses having someone who actually reads what you say, I‚Äôll listen.

Not looking to disrupt anyone‚Äôs life. Just want to talk to a woman who feels a little too much and maybe doesn‚Äôt say it out loud often enough.

1l6tx1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6tx1q,Noodle - Chapter 1 (457 bromance fanfic),"Hello! I‚Äôve decided to write a 457 bromance fanfic. It‚Äôs set in an alternate universe where the games don‚Äôt exist and Gi-hun and In-ho work side by side as doctors. 

I‚Äôve been writing fanfic since I was 7 years old and season 2 of squid game solidified for me that I needed to make a 457 story. Enjoy chapter 1!

(Also for your enjoyment I had chatGPT make a photo of gi-hun and in-ho as doctors and honestly I didn‚Äôt realize they could get even hotter than they already were‚Ä¶..)


Chapter 1
 
Dr. Hwang In-ho stepped through the sliding glass doors of Hanseo General Hospital with the familiar feeling of his soul detaching from his body. Night shift. Again. He wore his usual on-call uniform: dark navy scrubs under a fitted black Patagonia vest embroidered with ""Hwang In-ho, MD ‚Äî OB/GYN"" in crisp white thread. It was slightly frayed around the collar from too many shifts and too many coffee spills, but Hwang wore it like armor. Patagucci, they called it in the hospital‚Äîridiculously overpriced, but no one cared.

The air smelled like antiseptic and overbrewed coffee. A janitor was mopping near the front desk, earbuds in, swaying slightly to music no one else could hear.

Hwang‚Äôs shoes squeaked faintly as he made his way past the empty lobby and into the staff elevator. He pressed the button for the 7th floor‚Äîthe OB/GYN wing‚Äîand leaned against the cool metal wall. It was only 6:56 p.m., but he liked to be early. Early meant you got the better chair in the call room.

When the elevator doors opened, he walked out into the quiet hallway, nodding at a passing nurse. He turned left, toward the doctor‚Äôs lounge. The door creaked open.

Inside, Dr. Seong Gi-hun was already sprawled across the couch, one foot on the cushion, one foot on the floor, texting with the speed of a caffeinated teenager. His dark blue scrubs were wrinkled and a single AirPod dangled from one ear.

Hwang sighed.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù

Seong looked up. ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre early.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo are you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but I live here, so.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou smell like kimchi and regret.‚Äù

Seong grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the smell of a man who ate dinner in the anesthesia breakroom with one hand while charting with the other.‚Äù

‚ÄúDisgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúEfficient,‚Äù Seong corrected. ‚ÄúAlso, remember that creep from the PACU last night? The one who called you ‚Äòsweetheart‚Äô? Yeah. Coded. Twice.‚Äù

Hwang raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Whole mess of drama. They‚Äôre still arguing about whose fault it was. Probably his own for being an asshole.‚Äù

Hwang smirked despite himself. ‚ÄúTragic.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù Seong said with a snort. ‚ÄúYou want a moment of silence, or should we just talk shit instead?‚Äù

Hwang laughed and dropped his bag on the desk and claimed the only chair that didn‚Äôt lean dangerously to the left.

‚ÄúYou doing OB or gyn tonight?‚Äù Seong asked, unwrapping a protein bar and immediately tossing the wrapper onto the floor.

‚ÄúGyn,‚Äù Hwang replied.. ‚ÄúWhich means I‚Äôll either be in the OR all night or staring at a vaginitis consult until dawn. There‚Äôs no in-between.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou forgot the third option,‚Äù Seong said, kicking off his sneakers and flopping onto the bottom bunk.

Hwang raised an eyebrow as he sat at the desk.

Seong grinned. ‚ÄúYou get woken up by a screaming patient, do five minutes of pelvic trauma triage, and then I have to stab someone‚Äôs spine at 3 a.m. while half-asleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds about right.‚Äù Hwang leaned back in the creaky chair, booted up the monitor, and exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt mix up your propofol and your midazolam again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was one time,‚Äù Seong groaned into his pillow.

‚ÄúTry four.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Seong continued, stretching like a cat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the OR until midnight, then I‚Äôm technically free unless someone codes. So if you need me, text.‚Äù

Hwang looked at him. ‚ÄúDo you ever sleep?‚Äù

Seong reached into his scrub pocket and pulled out a full syringe rack. ‚ÄúSleep is for the patients, not me.‚Äù

Hwang made a face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to know how long those have been in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúFresh as your attitude,‚Äù Seong said, situating himself on the bottom bed of the bunk. ‚ÄúHave fun wasting away in the ED tonight.

Beep-beep-beep.

Hwang froze and stared at the pager like it had just insulted his mother. He‚Äôd been in the building for all of three minutes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me,‚Äù he muttered.

Seong looked up from his phone. ‚ÄúAlready?‚Äù

Hwang sighed and started his descent to the first floor.

 

The ED was chaotic as usual. Hwang sat perched on a rolling stool beside the workstation, squinting at his screen as he half-heartedly pecked at the keyboard. The consult list blinked at him like a middle finger. Three active OB/GYN pages. None urgent. He sighed, sipped the bitter hospital coffee, and clicked the first one.

Consult reason: Vaginal bleeding.

He sighed. Again? That was the third one tonight.

He walked to the curtained bay and pulled it back to find a young woman sitting upright, fully dressed, scrolling TikTok with one hand and eating Hot Cheetos with the other.

""Hi, I'm Dr. Hwang from OB/GYN,"" he started.

She didn't look up. ""I'm not pregnant, by the way. I just, like, spotted a little bit after sex.""

Hwang blinked. ""And... the bleeding stopped?""

""Yeah, it was like two drops. But I Googled it, and it said it could be cervical cancer or something, so my mom told me to come.""

He gave a tight smile. ‚ÄúGot it. Definitely not an emergency. You should follow up with your regular OB.‚Äù She nodded, still not looking up, and he backed away, curtain swishing closed behind him.

He was halfway back to his stool when his pager buzzed again.

Consult reason: Lower abdominal pain. R/O ectopic.

He gritted his teeth. A rule-out ectopic was never good. He hustled to the room, expecting a pale, doubled-over patient.

Instead, he found a guy on the gurney. Shirtless. Watching Mr. Sunshine on the overhead TV.

Hwang checked the patient ID. Double-checked it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre... Soo-jin?‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt look up from the TV. ‚ÄúOh nah, bro. She just went to get a Diet Coke.‚Äù

Hwang stood there, awkward. ‚ÄúOkay...‚Äù

Soo-jin returned a few moments later holding a can and some saltines. She looked fine. Chewing. Chatty. Not dying.

‚ÄúSo what brings you in?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a cramp earlier. I think it was my appendix, but I peed on a test and it was positive, so the nurse said it might be an ectopic. But like... I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm pregnant. I mean, my tubes are tied.‚Äù

Hwang stared at her. ‚ÄúWhen were they tied?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike... seven years ago? After my third baby.‚Äù

He pinched the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúOkay. Look, we‚Äôll do a quick ultrasound, but this sounds... highly not emergent.‚Äù

As he walked out, the nurse at the station gave him an apologetic smile. ‚ÄúSorry. The resident insisted.‚Äù

Hwang grunted. ‚ÄúOf course they did.‚Äù

He sat down again, barely got logged in, when the pager went off again.

Consult reason: Pelvic mass.

His eyes narrowed. He walked briskly to the assigned bay, prepared to palpate something suspicious.

Instead, he found an 80-year-old woman snoring peacefully under a thin blanket. Her chart was open on the bedside monitor.

Mass was... her bladder.

‚ÄúDistended bladder,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúPelvic mass, my ass.‚Äù

He stormed out of the room and tossed his clipboard onto the nurse's desk with a thwack.

Hwang‚Äôs pager buzzed for what felt like the millionth time.

Consult reason: Vaginal bleeding. Stat.

He let out an audible groan. ‚ÄúJesus Christ. Is it Opposite Day in the ER?‚Äù

He grabbed a new surgical mask with the same enthusiasm as someone retrieving a used tissue, then marched down the hall to Room 12. A door was half open, and behind it sat a middle-aged woman in a hospital gown, pale and visibly anxious, a thin sheet draped over her lap. A very green-looking intern hovered awkwardly by the bedside, clutching a clipboard like it was a life preserver.

He sighed and tugged on a pair of gloves. ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Dr. Hwang. I understand you‚Äôve had some bleeding?‚Äù

The woman nodded, looking mortified. ‚ÄúYes. It was bright red when I wiped. I‚Ä¶ I thought it was coming from my vagina.‚Äù

Hwang kept his expression neutral. ‚ÄúThanks for telling me. I‚Äôm going to take a look now and see what‚Äôs going on, okay?‚Äù

She nodded, lying back with stiff arms at her sides as the nurse helped guide her feet into the stirrups. Hwang grabbed the speculum from the stand, clicked on the exam light, and gently inserted the instrument.

He peered in.

Clean.

No blood. No discharge. No active bleeding. Her cervix looked pristine. Completely unremarkable.

His brows drew together. ‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù

He adjusted the angle slightly, looking lower.

And then he saw it: streaks of bright red blood trailing from the rectum. Not vaginal at all.

He straightened up slowly, removed the speculum with a soft click, and dropped it into the bin with more force than necessary.

The nurse gave him a curious glance. ‚ÄúNothing vaginal?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. Rectal bleeding.‚Äù He looked over his shoulder toward the hallway, already knowing which idiot was responsible.

He walked out of the room and found the intern by the nurses‚Äô station, hunched over a chart like he was studying the cure for cancer.

Hwang slammed the chart shut in front of him.

‚ÄúDo you know where the vagina is?‚Äù

The intern jumped. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? Because you paged me for vaginal bleeding and there is not a single drop of blood in the vagina. It‚Äôs coming from her rectum.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI thought she said‚Äî‚Äù

Hwang scoffed. ‚ÄúYou paged OB for rectal bleeding,‚Äù he said flatly. ‚ÄúCongratulations. I‚Äôm billing you personally for this consult.‚Äù

He stormed out of the ED, yelling, ‚ÄúIf anyone needs me, I‚Äôm going to fucking dental school!‚Äù

 

Hwang shoved the stairwell door open with his shoulder and trudged up each step. The echo of his footsteps bounced off the concrete walls, each one a little heavier than the last. His jaw was locked, his fists clenched. The whole ER had been one long parade of absurdity. Vaginal bleeding that was actually hemorrhoids. A positive pregnancy test on a patient with no uterus. A consult for a ‚Äúpelvic pain‚Äù that turned out to be too much kimchi.

He reached the top floor, slammed open the call room door, and stood in the threshold for a second, breathing hard.

Seong was already sprawled on the bottom bunk, one ankle propped on the opposite knee, staring at his phone in the dark. The screen lit up his face in flickers as he watched something with an absurd amount of screaming.

Hwang groaned. ‚ÄúWhy is it always so loud when you watch shows? Are they being murdered or just eating dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth,‚Äù Seong replied without looking up. ‚ÄúKorean dramas are very efficient.‚Äù

‚ÄúKorean dramas suck.‚Äù

Seong chuckled. ‚ÄúYou do one fucking fellowship in the states and now you‚Äôre too good for us.‚Äù

Hwang climbed to the top bunk and flopped onto his side with a grunt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna lose my license over a ruptured hemorrhoid. I can feel it coSeongg.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou say that every night.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause every night, someone bleeds from the wrong hole and I get paged like it‚Äôs a goddamn code blue.‚Äù

Seong finally locked his phone and rolled onto his side, tossing it on the tiny built-in shelf. ‚ÄúMaybe you just have a bad aura.‚Äù

Hwang pulled the pillow over his head. ‚ÄúMaybe you snore like a dying pig.‚Äù

Seong snorted. ‚ÄúMaybe you cry in your sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have one nightmare about a fish growing legs and chasing me and you never let it go.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you screamed, Hwang.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was vulnerable!‚Äù

A long pause stretched between them, just long enough for the warmth of sleep to start creeping into Hwang‚Äôs limbs. He let out a sigh, heavy and tired and slightly less annoyed now that his bones were horizontal.

Beep-beep-beep.

Hwang didn‚Äôt budge. He lay motionless on the top bunk, face buried in the pillow, blanket pulled up to his ears. His arm dangled over the edge, limp and dramatic, like he was already halfway to rigor mortis.

Seong stirred below. ‚ÄúPager.‚Äù

Hwang stayed perfectly still. ‚ÄúWhat pager?‚Äù

Seong waited. ‚ÄúYours.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Hwang shifted just enough to bury his head deeper into the pillow. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be. That‚Äôs not my pager‚Äôs ringtone.‚Äù

‚ÄúPagers don‚Äôt have ringtones you asshole.‚Äù

Hwang didn‚Äôt respond.

Seong sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a little bitch when you‚Äôre tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am unconscious. This is a corpse. You are speaking to a body.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre breathing.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù

Seong sat up with a grunt, reached down, grabbed one of his hospital-issued Crocs, and held it for a second like he was aiming a grenade. He then lobbed the shoe up toward the top bunk.. It arced up and smacked Hwang square in the head.

‚ÄúJESUS CHRIST.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou awake now?‚Äù

Hwang peeled the blanket off his face just enough to glare downward. ‚ÄúYou violated me.‚Äù

Seong flopped back down and tucked his hands behind his head. ‚ÄúI had no choice.‚Äù

Hwang grabbed the pager off the ledge and groaned as he read the screen. ‚ÄúOB consult. Vaginal bleeding. Stat.‚Äù

Seong didn‚Äôt even flinch. ‚ÄúPlace your bets.‚Äù

Hwang swung his legs off the bunk like he was being deployed to war. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs ass blood again, I‚Äôm changing my name, moving to North Korea, and never looking back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou say that every night,‚Äù Seong said, eyes already drifting shut.

‚ÄúThis time I mean it.‚Äù

Hwang shoved his feet into his clogs, yanked on his vest like it had personally wronged him, and slammed the call room door behind him.

Seong barely lifted his head. ‚ÄúGodspeed, bitch.‚Äù

 

Hwang walked to the ER like a man heading to jury duty in the rain. Every step was deliberate, heavy, and unhurried. He didn‚Äôt rush. Didn‚Äôt even try to fake urgency. His clogs slapped against the linoleum floor with the same tired rhythm as his thoughts: It‚Äôs going to be nothing. Again. Wrong hole. Again. Some intern panicked because someone bled near a vagina and now I‚Äôm the goddamn blood police.

He passed a pair of nurses who looked up at him.

‚ÄúI thought you were going to sleep, Dr. Hwang,‚Äù one of the nurses said, amusement in her voice.

Hwang dramatically tilted his head back and groaned loudly. The nurses chuckled.

He pushed open the door to the room, ready to be annoyed.

And stopped.

Emma Wright was sitting upright on the stretcher, her hospital gown loose around her shoulders, one hand gripping the side rail, knuckles white, groaning in pain. The fluorescent lighting should‚Äôve washed her out. They should‚Äôve made her look sallow and sick like everyone else in the ER. But somehow, she looked ethereal.

Her skin was pale but luminous, like porcelain held up to moonlight. She had natural copper-red hair pulled back into two thick French braids that draped over her collarbones, fraying at the ends from sweat and stress. Her cheeks were flushed, lips parted just slightly as she breathed through her mouth, trying not to panic. There was something wild and alert in her expression‚Äîlike a deer in headlights, scared but full of fight. Her eyes were huge, rimmed with red but startlingly clear, this impossible shade of green-gray that caught the overhead light and held it.

She looked up and met his gaze.

And Hwang felt something sharp twist in his chest.

Beautiful.

Not in the polished, Instagram-filter way. In the real, visceral way. The kind that made your breath hitch for a second before you remembered to be a doctor.

Then his gaze dropped. And that‚Äôs when he saw it.

Blood.

Everywhere.

Smeared across the sheet, pooled between her thighs, already soaking through the pad someone had shoved underneath her. It was too much. Bright red, fast. He could smell the iron in the air. His training kicked in before his brain could even catch up.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he breathed, stepping forward. ‚ÄúHow long has she been bleeding like this?‚Äù

The nurse turned, startled. ‚ÄúAbout twenty minutes. We just got her pressure. Ninety over sixty and falling.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes she speak Korean?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not a word.‚Äù

Hwang moved fast.

He pressed the back of his gloved hand to Emma‚Äôs cheek. It was cold, clammy, too pale.

‚ÄúGet a CBC, type and screen, stat,‚Äù he said to the nurse. ‚ÄúCall the blood bank..‚Äù

‚ÄúBP just dropped again. 86/52.‚Äù

Emma whimpered.

He crouched slightly to meet her eyes and spoke in English. ‚ÄúHey. Emma, right?‚Äù

She nodded, barely.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre scared. You‚Äôre losing a lot of blood, but you‚Äôre in the right place. I‚Äôm going to figure out where it‚Äôs coming from and stop it. But I need to do an exam, okay?‚Äù

Tears welled. She nodded.

He pulled the curtain, pulled on a fresh pair of gloves, and rolled a stool toward the foot of the gurney. The room was a blur behind him‚Äînurses pulling supplies, someone calling upstairs, a vitals monitor pinging too fast.

He draped her legs with a sheet.

‚ÄúDeep breath, Emma.‚Äù

He used a swab to clear the blood. Inserted the speculum slowly. Blood coated the blades immediately.

‚ÄúAlmost there‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre doing great‚Ä¶‚Äù

The cervix came into view, and Hwang frowned immediately. The os was open, and blood oozed steadily from it. Not active arterial spurting, but more of a constant, heavy trickle. There were clots, but no visible tissue.

‚ÄúAny recent procedures?‚Äù he asked, not taking his eyes off the field.

‚ÄúN-no,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI had an IUD put in two years ago. That‚Äôs it.‚Äù

He nodded slowly. ‚ÄúStill in place?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so. I haven‚Äôt felt anything.‚Äù

He gently palpated the strings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there. Okay.‚Äù

She winced. ‚ÄúOw.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúThat part‚Äôs done.‚Äù

He removed the speculum and gently palpated her abdomen. The uterus was slightly enlarged. Boggy. Not firm like it should be.

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding? Maybe retained products? Could be hormonal. Could be a spontaneous hemorrhage. Could be‚Ä¶

He stood up and peeled off his gloves, throwing them in the biohazard bin. ‚ÄúWe need to do a procedure to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúSurgery?‚Äù

‚ÄúA minor one,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain everything, but I need to act fast. I‚Äôm going to have the team bring you upstairs. You‚Äôll be asleep. You won‚Äôt feel it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really scared,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had surgery before. Or anesthesia. Or‚Ä¶ anything.‚Äù

He softened a bit and reassuringly placed a hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll be there the whole time.‚Äù

Emma nodded again, lip trembling.

He turned to the nurse. ‚ÄúTell the OR we‚Äôre coming. I want anesthesia paged. I want her on the board within twenty minutes.‚Äù

Hwang stood at the corner workstation, fingers flying over the keyboard as he updated Emma‚Äôs chart. The glow of the monitor cast a cold light across his face while nurses bustled around the gurney, peeling off the bulky ED monitors, swapping them for portable leads, snapping both side rails into place with crisp metallic clicks. One nurse gathered the IV tubing and secured it with a fresh strip of tape, while another tucked a blanket around Emma‚Äôs legs, moving fast but gentle.

Hwang hit ‚Äúenter‚Äù on the final order, just as the sliding doors parted behind him with a soft whoosh.

Seong strode in, dark blue scrubs slightly wrinkled, his hair tousled like he‚Äôd just rolled out of bed‚Äîwhich he probably had. He had a few syringes poking out of his breast pocket and his surgical mask hanging off one ear.

Hwang looked up from the side of the gurney, relief and urgency flashing across his face. ‚ÄúPerfect timing.‚Äù

He motioned toward the patient. ‚ÄúGi-hun, this is Emma.‚Äù

Seong gave a polite bow as he approached the bedside. ‚ÄúHello, Emma. I‚Äôm Dr. Seong. I‚Äôm the anesthesiologist‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúShe only speaks English,‚Äù Hwang cut in, voice low.

Seong stopped mid-sentence and blinked at him, then gave Emma a sheepish smile and switched gears instantly. He approached the gurney, offering a small smile as he met Emma‚Äôs eyes and began speaking in English. ‚ÄúHello, Emma. I‚Äôm Dr. Seong. I do sleepy medicine.‚Äù He pointed to her IV with a nod. ‚ÄúYou feel nervous? I help, okay? You safe with me.‚Äù

Hwang could feel the tension in the air thickening by the second ‚Äì Emma pale and shaking, Seong fumbling through his slow, careful English, the nurses darting around trying to keep up with the bleeding. He glanced at Emma, trying to ground her, then jerked his chin toward Seong with a half-smirk. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said, voice dry. ‚ÄúHis English is a train wreck, but his hands are steady and he‚Äôs got terrifyingly good aim with narcotics.‚Äù

Seong snorted without looking up from the IV line, muttering something that definitely wasn‚Äôt a compliment. Emma gave a breathy, startled laugh, and that tiny sound cracked the heaviness in the room just enough for everyone to breathe.

Seong‚Äôs smile faded a little as he caught the tension in her eyes. She looked up at him from the gurney, her face pale, lips pressed tight.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be asleep,‚Äù she said quickly, voice shaky but firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt wake up. I‚Ä¶please, can I stay awake?‚Äù

Seong blinked, taken slightly off guard. He looked to Hwang, then back to Emma.

‚ÄúNo sleep?‚Äù he repeated slowly, making sure he understood. ‚ÄúYou want‚Ä¶ awake?‚Äù

Emma nodded hard. ‚ÄúIf I can. Please. I just‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to never wake up.‚Äù

Seong scratched behind his ear, then gave a thoughtful grunt.  ‚ÄúOkay, we do sleepy but uh-‚Äù he couldn‚Äôt think of the English word he wanted to use. ‚ÄúUh, no sleep sleep. Floaty, happy, no sleep. No tube.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes searched his face like she was looking for any reason to believe him. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll walk you through everything,‚Äù Hwang said. ‚ÄúAnd Dr. Seong here is excellent. You‚Äôll be safe the entire time.‚Äù

Seong grinned. ‚ÄúI got pocket full of magic,‚Äù he said, patting the syringes in his scrub pocket. ‚ÄúYou feel pain, I fix it fast. These are the good drugs.‚Äù

Emma cracked a faint smile, the first Hwang had seen from her since the exam.

Seong picked up the IV line and inserted a syringe filled with midazolam into the port. ‚ÄúLittle sleepy now,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúFeel strange.‚Äù

As the sedative crept into her veins, Emma‚Äôs eyes started to flutter. ‚ÄúI still want to be awake,‚Äù she slurred in a panic.

‚ÄúYou will be,‚Äù Seong promised. ‚ÄúYou not missing a thing.‚Äù

The gurney wheels squeaked softly as the nurses unlocked the brakes, pivoting Emma toward the hallway. One of them handed Hwang a clipboard of printed vitals and chart notes; he glanced over it quickly before placing it on Emma‚Äôs lap with a reassuring tap. ‚ÄúJust for the ride,‚Äù he murmured.

The fluorescent lights of the ED flickered overhead as they rolled past curtained bays and open trauma rooms. A transport tech guided the foot of the stretcher while Seong walked alongside her head, one hand loosely on the railing, the other holding her IV tubing aloft. He kept his eyes on the monitor, glancing down now and then to check her expression.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Seong asked, his voice low and thick with accent. ‚ÄúSafe?‚Äù

Emma nodded faintly, her fingers curling into the blanket. ‚ÄúStill here.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said, with a quiet chuckle. ‚ÄúI am too.‚Äù

The hallway curved sharply left into the OR wing, where everything changed. The lights were brighter, air colder, the smell suddenly sharp with antiseptic. The automatic double doors whooshed open with a press of the wall button, revealing a surgical suite already prepped and waiting. Blue drapes, stainless steel trays, overhead booms, and a spotlight angled toward the table like a stage light waiting for its star.

A scrub nurse met them at the door and gestured them in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all set.‚Äù

Hwang moved out the way to let the gurney pass through and set off to go scrub in.

The team moved quickly. One nurse unlocked the gurney rails while another held the draw sheet. Emma barely registered the countdown.

‚ÄúOne, two, three‚Äî‚Äù

She was shifted from the stretcher to the narrow OR table in a smooth coordinated pull. The surface was hard, padded only at the center, her limbs suddenly feeling out of place as the nurses began strapping her arms to supports connected to each side of the table.

Seong leaned over her, securing the blood pressure cuff to her other arm as the monitors came to life with beeps and chirps. He was moving fast, but his tone stayed light, even a little sing-songy.

‚ÄúYou do good noodle,‚Äù he said, giving her a quick, crooked smile. ‚ÄúVery brave.‚Äù

Emma blinked and lifted her head to look up at Seong, confused. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Seong tapped her shoulder gently. ‚ÄúLike ramen. Not stiff. You move nice. No fight.‚Äù

A scrub nurse snorted. ‚ÄúHe means you didn‚Äôt flail. It‚Äôs a compliment in Dr. Seong-speak.‚Äù

Seong nodded solemnly, as if this was the highest praise he could offer. ‚ÄúGood noodle.‚Äù

Emma gave a small, shaky laugh - half in terror, half in absurd relief - and let her head fall back against the table.

She was officially a noodle now. A terrified, bleeding noodle about to have surgery. But somehow, she didn‚Äôt feel quite so alone.

One tear silently rolled down Emma‚Äôs cheeks. Her heart raced, and the monitor echoed her panic in a quickening chorus of sharp beeps.

Seong stood at the head of the table, dark blue scrub cap slightly askew, a syringe already in hand.  ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked Emma gently, his Korean accent softening the edges of his English. He adjusted the IV line and gave a practiced glance at her vitals. ‚ÄúLittle more medicine, okay noodle?‚Äù He injected more midazolam and slipped the oxygen tubing under her nose, looped it over her ears, then tightened it gently beneath her chin to hold it in place.

Emma nodded again quickly, closing her eyes. More tears dripped out as her eyes shut.

The scrub nurses worked efficiently, their movements practiced and calm. One gently lifted Emma‚Äôs right leg into the padded stirrup, adjusting the strap around her thigh to hold it steady. The other did the same on the left, spreading her open and exposed under the bright surgical lights. Emma's fingers clenched as she felt the cold sting of betadine swiped across her vulva, then a second jolt as the soaked sponge was pressed inside her, twisting deeper than she expected. She gasped, startled‚Äînot from pain, but from the sudden, intimate invasion. ‚ÄúJust cleaning,‚Äù one nurse murmured softly, her tone more clinical than comforting.

‚ÄúBreathe,‚Äù Seong whispered gently, patting her shoulder. ‚ÄúClose your eyes.‚Äù He pushed another half milligram of midazolam.

Emma shut her eyes and took a deep shuddering breath through her nose, trying desperately to relax her muscles. Her head spun and she felt dizzy with the addition of more sedation.

Within seconds, the sterile blue drapes were unfolding around her like theater curtains, framing only the surgical field and blotting out the rest of her body.

The door swung open with a quiet hiss as Dr. Hwang stepped in from the scrub room, hands held up at chest level, gloved and glistening. His gown was a crisp sterile blue, tied tight at the back by one of the circulating nurses. He moved with calm precision, eyes scanning the setup as he approached the table. His gaze flicked briefly to Emma. It was just for a moment, but it was enough for her to feel the shift in the air. The light above her buzzed faintly. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, voice muffled slightly by his mask but still warm, steady. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get started.‚Äù

One of the nurses placed a sterile tray beside him, and he nodded without looking, already positioning himself between the drapes.

‚ÄúEmma, I‚Äôm going to place the speculum now and then give you some numbing injections around your cervix.‚Äù Hwang‚Äôs voice was gentle and soft. Immediately, he saw her expression change. Her head shot upward and her hand clenched into a tight fist, face full of fear.

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ with a needle?‚Äù Her voice was small. Trembling. Tears welled up in her eyes and she began audibly crying.

Hwang stopped what he was doing and set the speculum back down. ‚ÄúHey, hey. You‚Äôre okay,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs a small needle. But I‚Äôll walk you through every second of it, and I promise to go slow.‚Äù

Emma gave a tiny shake of her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do well with needles,‚Äù she said, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúI know that sounds childish‚Ä¶ Will it hurt?‚Äù

Hwang paused, just a second too long. He glanced up at Seong, who stood near Emma‚Äôs head, arms crossed, monitoring her vitals. Their eyes met for a beat, a silent ‚ÄúShould we sugarcoat it?‚Äù

Seong gave a slow exhale, then nodded.

Hwang turned back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to lie to you. It will be uncomfortable.‚Äù

Emma let out a nervous half chuckle. ‚Äú‚ÄòUncomfortable‚Äô is doctor code for excruciatingly painful.‚Äù

Hwang continued, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs quick, and Dr. Seong here,‚Äù he nodded to the anesthesiologist, ‚Äúcan help with pain meds to make it easier.‚Äù

Emma looked toward Seong, uncertain.

Seong leaned in just a little, voice soft but warm. ‚ÄúI give pain medicine now, okay? You feel floaty.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúFloaty good or floaty scary?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Seong said with a small grin. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ warm cloud. Just breathe.‚Äù

He pushed a dose of fentanyl into her IV. The tension in Emma‚Äôs shoulders loosened almost instantly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù Seong encouraged.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she murmured, eyes closed. ‚ÄúI trust you guys.‚Äù

Hwang adjusted the overhead light. Emma‚Äôs breathing hitched again.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Hwang said gently, placing a hand on her knee, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start now.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs body flinched in anticipatory fear, her legs and arms twitching against the restraints. Hwang could sense her terror and stopped in his tracks. His voice dropped a little, more personal. ‚ÄúWanna know a trick that helps?‚Äù

Emma blinked up at him. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

He reached for one of the glass lidocaine carpules and syringe. ‚ÄúThis is the medicine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt goes into this syringe. But to use it, I have to smack the back end to lock in the harpoon. Watch.‚Äù

He gave the syringe a clean smack against his palm. The harpoon clicked into the rubber stopper with a small snick.

Emma flinched. Then gave a tentative half-smile. ‚ÄúThat sounded kinda violent‚Ä¶ but satisfying?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it gets better.‚Äù He held it up dramatically. ‚ÄúAfter the injection, I pull back on this sucker, and it makes the best sound in the world.‚Äù

He gave a hard tug. The rubber stopper came free with a loud pop, that oddly satisfying sound of pressure releasing.

Emma‚Äôs eyebrows lifted. ‚ÄúOh. Okay. That is kinda good.‚Äù

Hwang grinned under his mask. ‚ÄúI call that your reward for making it through each injection.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're bribing me with‚Ä¶. pops?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but you see these pops are better than bubble wrap pops,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúFour little stings, and you get four pops. Deal?‚Äù

She nodded quickly, eyes still glistening but more curious than afraid now. Seong, up by her head, gave a quiet smile and rubbed her upper arm reassuringly. ‚ÄúMore noodle. Not firm body, very very noodle.‚Äù

Emma laughed. ‚ÄúWhat is that supposed to mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe means try to relax your muscles,‚Äù Hwang explained. ‚ÄúThe more tense you are, the more uncomfortable it will be. Inserting the speculum now‚Ä¶‚Äù

Seong gave a quick push of fentanyl in anticipation. The fast push of narcotics made Emma‚Äôs nose itch as euphoria and warmness set in. Emma‚Äôs body felt heavy ‚Äì so heavy it was almost painful. Her eyes closed involuntarily and she let out a soft sigh, her ears ringing and the room melting away.

Hwang inserted the speculum and exposed the cervix.

‚ÄúOkay, first one. Tiny sting on your left side.‚Äù

He injected at the 3 o‚Äôclock position. Emma gasped softly.

Hwang immediately popped the used carpule out. Pop.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your first reward,‚Äù he said, already sliding in a fresh one and smacking the syringe to engage the harpoon. ‚ÄúNext side, Ready?.‚Äù

She tensed but nodded. ‚ÄúReady.‚Äù

Injection two at 9 o‚Äôclock. Emma screamed loudly in pain. She squirmed and groaned as the anesthetic was injected.

‚ÄúYou need to give her something stronger,‚Äù Hwang barked in Korean at Seong, withdrawing the needle. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this with her moving all over the place.‚Äù

Seong moved quickly. ‚ÄúGiving a bump of ketamine,‚Äù he told Hwang, as he injected the medication into Emma‚Äôs. Speaking in English he said, ‚ÄúOk, Emma. You rocketship, blast off into space now.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs muscles quickly relaxed and she seemed to melt into the OR table as warmth spread up her arm and blossomed in her chest. She laid on the table, still at last, the panicked thoughts in her head no longer screaming.

Hwang reinserted the needle and continued injecting.

Pop.

‚ÄúThat one was louder,‚Äù Emma murmured, her eyes closed. Her words slurred more and more with each push of sedatives.

‚ÄúYou earned it,‚Äù Hwang said. He smacked in another carpule and angled the syringe carefully for the next spot ‚Äî 12 o‚Äôclock.

Emma shut her eyes tightly as the needle went in.

Pop.

‚ÄúLast one,‚Äù Hwang said, inserting the last lidocaine cartridge into the syringe. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great.‚Äù

She winced hard as it went in. Seong noticed and pushed more fentanyl.

Pop. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs four for four.‚Äù

She laughed under her breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weirdly good at this.‚Äù

‚ÄúPractice,‚Äù he said, dropping the syringe on the tray with a metallic clatter. ‚ÄúOkay. That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre done with the hard part. We‚Äôll wait a few minutes for it to kick in.‚Äù

Seong smiled at Emma under his mask. ‚ÄúHigh five!‚Äù he said, holding up his hand.

Emma stared blankly at him. ‚ÄúDr. Seong‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt move my arms.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ right.‚Äù Seong reached toward Emma‚Äôs strapped-down hand and gently slapped her palm in a clumsy high five.

Emma let out a dazed, amused laugh, her head lolling side to side on the table. Her eyes were glassed over, pupils dilated. ‚ÄúThose drugs,‚Äù she slurred, ‚Äúare so-o-o-o-o good.‚Äù

She started giggling. Quiet at first, then louder, her shoulders shaking against the straps. Seong glanced at the monitors, slightly alarmed, until he saw her face: flushed, glazed, and clearly not in pain. Just deeply, chemically unbothered.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù she slurred, still laughing. ‚ÄúI feel like one of those trashy girls at the bar who can‚Äôt walk in heels and keeps falling off the damn stool.‚Äù

Hwang raised an eyebrow from behind the drape. ‚ÄúThe ones who scream-sing to Beyonc√© at 1 a.m.?‚Äù

Emma let out an even louder laugh. ‚ÄúYes! That‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm Beyonc√© girl. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm, like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the drunk girl who cries and flirts with the bartender and says her ex didn‚Äôt deserve her. Which he didn‚Äôt, by the way.‚Äù

Seong chuckled softly. ‚ÄúSedation working good.‚Äù

Emma blinked at him, then tilted her head lazily toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cute,‚Äù she said suddenly. ‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ really cute. With your little‚Äî‚Äù her head lolled side to side, ‚Äú‚Äîyour face. And your accent. And your sleepy eyes.‚Äù

Hwang cleared his throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here.‚Äù

Emma twisted her head toward the sound of his voice and beamed. ‚ÄúYou too! You‚Äôre hot. You‚Äôve got, like‚Ä¶ trauma dad energy. Sexy in a why do I trust you kind of way.‚Äù

There was a beat of silence. One of the scrub nurses bit her lip to keep from laughing.

Emma kept going, undeterred. ‚ÄúMaybe after this,‚Äù she slurred, ‚Äúyou can take me to a real bar. Like‚Ä¶ not a hospital one. A real one. You and me. Both of you. Because normally I don‚Äôt let men see all the goods until they‚Äôve bought me drinks..‚Äù

Hwang pressed his lips together, a sharp breath catching in his throat as he fought back a laugh threatening to escape. He felt his stomach drop with the realization that this wasn‚Äôt just another patient to him‚Ä¶ no, he felt something else. Was is lust? Was it love? Whatever it was, it made him feel uncomfortable inside knowing that it was unethical‚Ä¶but so, so right.

Seong leaned over her, adjusting her nasal cannula, face carefully neutral. ‚ÄúOkay, Beyonc√©. Maybe time to sleep now?

Emma giggled, loose and giddy. ‚ÄúNo, no, I‚Äôm having fun. You‚Äôre fun. This is fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe clearly doesn‚Äôt remember the last five minutes,‚Äù Hwang muttered, mostly to himself.

Emma sluggishly lifted her head, eyes squinting toward him. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she asked, brows furrowed‚Äîthen immediately dropped her head back down with a dramatic thud. ‚ÄúWhat the fuhhh-k-k-k-k is even going on right now?‚Äù Her eyes fluttered shut as she dissolved into uncontrollable laughter, cackling like she‚Äôd just told the best joke of her life.

The whole OR cracked. Nurses were trying to keep it together behind masks, one of the techs snorting outright.

‚ÄúI hate to kill the vibe,‚Äù Hwang said, straightening and grabbing a pair of forceps, ‚Äúbut we really do need to get started now.‚Äù

Emma‚Äôs eyes were still closed, her voice syrupy with sedation. ‚ÄúBaby,‚Äù she slurred, grinning like the lights were spinning, ‚Äúyou can do whatever-r-r-r-r-r you want to me.‚Äù

Hwang froze mid-motion, then slowly ducked his head, face going crimson under his mask. ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù he mumbled.

Seong was wheezing silently in the corner. ‚ÄúShe call you baby. I quit.‚Äù

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows you which Maryland and DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Silver Spring, Georgetown, or Shaw.

Feels nice. I can see why people post here.



I didn‚Äôt plan on a part two. I figured I would share the weird thing that happened to me on the scary story board, and people would be happy with that. But I guess I told the story so good, you want more. I get it. The only problem is, what happened next is even harder to believe. I‚Äôm not sure I even believe it myself.



Here‚Äôs the logical explanation: After I fell in the water, I passed out, some weird things happened in my head, and then I woke up. That happens, right? People pass out and see heaven, or an alternate life where they‚Äôre Chinese. Maybe that‚Äôs what happened to me.



When I woke up, I was laid out on the dirty tile floor of the pool lobby, surrounded by gawkers and paramedics. My target was gone. She was the one that alerted the clerk I had fallen in. I guess she saved my life. It was an extremely stupid thing to do, but I guess I‚Äôm thankful.



The problem is, that‚Äôs not all I remember about that night. In my head, there was a whole lot more to it. There was a‚Ä¶ something, in the water. Then a boat. Then an island. I felt like I was in that ‚Äúroom‚Äù all night, but the clerk says he pulled me out only a couple minutes after I fell in. It doesn‚Äôt make any fucking sense.



When I wrote the first part, I was convinced that I had imagined all of the stuff in between. But over the last few nights, I‚Äôve been dreaming about it constantly. I‚Äôm not a creative person. I don't write, I don't fantasize, I don't read. But I can still remember it all: the sea creatures, and the man on the boat‚Äôs smile, and the sand.



I‚Äôll never understand why people care to read this shit, but‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll just tell you what I remember, and let you decide for yourselves whether I‚Äôm making it all up.



‚Äî--------------------------



‚ÄúCome back you fucking bitch!‚Äù I screamed in the dark. ‚ÄúOpen the fucking door!‚Äù



I splashed my arms against the water, furious.



How had I fallen in? I saw how far away the door was from the pool before the pool lights went out, and I wasn‚Äôt anywhere close. In fact, I was seconds away from grabbing the handle and getting out. But then, all at once, the floor was water. It didn‚Äôt figure. It‚Äôs like the pool had reached out and grabbed me.



‚ÄúGood trick! Yeah, alright, you got me!‚Äù I shouted again, my words muffled like a pouty child screaming into a pillow. She couldn‚Äôt hear me. She was free, and I was here in this fucking pool.



*You‚Äôre stuck with it tonight*, she had said.



Bullshit. She was trying to scare me; act like I was trapped in the water with something. Right. No, the truth was that I had severely misjudged distances, and the size of the pool, and I was just turned around. If I picked a direction and swam, I‚Äôd find the edge eventually.



So, I started swimming.



The salt water had flooded my eyes when I fell into the pool, and they were stinging like a motherfucker. Not that they were doing me much good anyways. I couldn‚Äôt see my hand in front of my face.



I couldn‚Äôt find the edge anywhere. And I was starting to get tired.



To make matters worse, my goddamn clothes were sticking to me like cling wrap. I could feel them getting heavier and heavier, dragging against my every stroke. I couldn‚Äôt go on swimming like this. I would have to strip.



I peeled off my shirt and let it sink silently down to the bottom of the pool. It skimmed my foot on the way down. I realized then that I hadn‚Äôt touched the bottom yet. How deep did this pool go?



There‚Äôs a stretch of the Wharfe River in Yorkshire, England called The Strid. It‚Äôs only 6 feet across, and from the outside, it looks like any other quaint English creek. If you make the mistake of taking a swim, however, the first thing you would feel is a sucking current. And as you felt for the bottom, you would realize in horror that it wasn‚Äôt there‚Äìthat it was 700 feet below.



In my mind, the pool was even deeper. I imagined being sucked down, whirling helplessly past schools of fish, sea turtles, shipwrecks, leviathans with tentacles a mile long‚Ä¶



I patted myself down and found that all my tools were still on my belt: the wire, the gun, and the gloves.



The idea of dropping my gun was akin to cutting off my hand. I didn‚Äôt feel right without it. And the wire was compact enough that I could easily just keep it in the waistband of my briefs. The gloves, however, had to go. I released them into the darkness, followed by my shoes, my socks, and my pants. There I was, treading water in my underwear with a gun in my hand, like an Alcatraz escapee.¬†



That‚Äôs when I felt something brush my bare foot.



It felt like the playful tickle of a finger.



I kicked out instinctively, and when I did I made contact with something. It was smooth and squishy like‚Ä¶ well, like human skin.¬†



Like someone was swimming beneath me.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù I screamed, my words still a useless rattle in my head. My entire body pulled up like I was trying to fold in on myself. ‚ÄúGet the fuck away!‚Äù



I pointed the gun down into the water in panic and pulled the trigger. I barely heard the gunshot; it sounded like a balloon popping fifty feet over my roof. I felt the pressure change as the bullet whizzed past my leg, and I realized in a split second that I had been inches away from shooting off my own foot. I hadn‚Äôt planned on shooting. Frankly, I was surprised the gun still fired after so long in the water. It was completely instinctual. So, when the recoil flashed up my arm, it slipped right out of my hands.



‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù



I reached down desperately into the black water to catch it. I got a finger across the barrel, still hot from the gunshot, but it bounced right off and dropped like a stone down through the dark waters into the deep. Just like that, my gun was gone.



‚ÄúFuck me!‚Äù I cried.¬†



I had no idea if I had hit anything, but considering it was a literal shot in the dark, the odds weren‚Äôt in my favor. More than likely, the thing (I didn‚Äôt want to entertain the idea that it was a human being) was still somewhere below the surface of the water. Hell, it could be right in front of me, staring into my eyes silently, watching me, and I would‚Äôve had no idea; that was how complete the darkness was. The idea was enough to turn my stomach.



For a moment I imagined I could hear it breathing beside me, but I quickly shook the illusion. I took a few deep breaths of my own and composed myself.



That must be the ‚Äúit‚Äù my target was referring to as she left. I guess it found me.



There was nothing I could do about that. If this thing was trying to kill me, it could have done that a long time ago. Not to mention, if this thing was lethal, why would that woman choose to swim with it every week?



If it was still here, I just wished it wouldn‚Äôt touch me again. That was a wish that I‚Äôm pretty sure didn‚Äôt come true.



I kept swimming.¬†



It didn‚Äôt take long before I saw the lights.



Between strokes, I picked up a faint glow in the distance.



My heart leapt. The door? Had I swam all this time, for what felt like hours now, and finally reached the exit? *Just keep swimming* was all she told me, and I did what she said.



But‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt a single point of light. The shape was all wrong, nothing like an open door, and the color was off too. It looked like the residual blue on the horizon after the sunset; like a soft brushstroke laid along the surface of the waters ahead.



I began to swim faster. Whatever it was, it was better than darkness. My body was beginning to ache, the skin on my extremities was completely pruned, and I was feeling nauseous from all the salt water I‚Äôd accidentally drank. The worst part, though, was that the water was getting colder. It felt like I had swam out of the shallows on a summer coast and into the middle of the Pacific. My energy was almost depleted. I had to get out of the water.



As I approached the blue lights, I thought about Virgo‚Äôs. The idea of a nice hot burnt cup of coffee sounded like a dream. When I got home, I was going to give Mike the biggest hug. (And I did, too. He hated it almost as much as I did)



The closer I got to the light, the more vast it seemed. I think it was moving towards me, too, because before I even realized it, the light had begun to envelop me. All around was a sea of little blue points of light, like bioluminescent jellyfish, or algae, or something. It was like swimming in stars.¬†



I‚Äôm not a whimsical person. If someone told me about a ‚Äúspiritual experience‚Äù, I‚Äôd laugh in their face. But, I have to admit‚Ä¶ this was wonderful. For a brief moment, I forgot how tired I was, and the screaming ache of my muscles quieted. I scooped out a handful of water. I had one of the lights in my hand. It was alive, I think, because it drifted from one end of my hand-pool to the other, then back again; not really swimming, but floating with intention. What a cool creature. My curiosity satisfied, I poured it back into the water to be with its friends again.



As I did, I saw the outline of my hand against the glowing water. I could *see* something. I hadn‚Äôt even registered that fact until that moment.



I looked down into the water and saw my legs kicking among the blue spots.I saw the pattern on my underwear. I saw the hair on my shirtless chest. After hours of being in complete and total darkness, without even the ability to cross my eyes and see my nose, I could actually see *myself* again.¬†



I smiled.



It occurred to me in my excitement that maybe the blue creatures marked the beginning of a different zone of this place. If there was light now, then maybe there would be sound again, too. Dare I dream?



‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said tentatively. The words didn‚Äôt dribble from my lips; they sounded out across the waters. Beyond the vibrations in my head, I could actually hear myself again, too.



I realized then that up until that point, I had already mentally forfeited to the darkness. Though I kept swimming, hope had quietly packed up and left me. My subconscious was certain that the creature below would pull me down to join it, or I would succumb to exhaustion and follow my clothes to the unknown depths of this cursed fucking pool.



But, with my senses returned, I found a second wind. I had to get the hell out of this place.



‚ÄúAHHHHHH!‚Äù I shouted. I don‚Äôt really want to admit how long I made senseless, barbaric noises, just savoring the sound of my own voice.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming home, bitch! I‚Äôm coming!‚Äù



I spun around in the expanse of blue light.



That‚Äôs when I heard a *snap*. Not like a branch cracking; like fingers.



I stopped spinning. There was something a few feet away from me in the water, sticking straight up like a tree branch.



As my eyes focused, my smile eroded from my face in an instant.



It was a human hand. And it was waving.



I recoiled, screaming. I splashed violently at the water in an attempt to move away from it. This was the creature‚Äìthe hand that had grazed my foot. God only knew what the rest of it looked like beneath the water, but I had a hard time imagining it was human.¬†



The hand didn‚Äôt chase me. It stopped waving and did another gesture: it laid its palm flat and moved the hand down towards the water. I understood it. *Hush*, it was saying, like a teacher at an assembly lowering the kids‚Äô volume level.



I stopped moving away. I stared at the hand, my brow furrowed, panting. Any moment it would lurch forward to drown me. Any‚Ä¶ moment‚Ä¶



Instead, it gestured again: it pointed one long index finger directly at me (*You!,* it said) and then beckoned me, folding its fingers into its palm repeatedly (*Come here*).



‚ÄúNo, no, stay the fuck away from me,‚Äù I said. I had no idea if the thing could understand me, but I said it anyways. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me.‚Äù



The hand gave me a thumbs up. *Okay, I won‚Äôt*.



I was still scared to death of the thing. I don‚Äôt know if it was a trick of the light or not, but it seemed like it was floating closer and closer to me. I would swim back, subtly, and it would close the gap. It wanted to be near me.



It did several more gestures, but at the time, I had no idea what it was trying to tell me. First, it bounced its palm against the water, skimming. *A wave?* I thought. I hadn‚Äôt seen a single wave since I had started swimming. It was a pool, after all.



Next, with a flat hand, it plunged in the water, and stayed for a moment. *Dive*? *Hide*? I wasn‚Äôt sure.¬†



Then, it made its index and ring fingers into legs and ran with them along the water, away from me. *Run*, or *run away*, perhaps, but I wasn‚Äôt following. From what? From a wave? From it? It occurred to me that this could just be some twisted game the creature liked to play. Tantalus-style torture, maybe, just like the kind I thought my client might be enacting against the woman. Now, though, I understood why my client wanted me to get her before she touched the water. It was a portal of some kind, to the domain of this strange creature. And I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that no matter what it communicated, it was trying to hurt me, somehow.



Finally, it pointed at me again, this time with the thumb up like a finger gun, and then brought the hammer down. *Bang*.



Was it referring to when I shot at it earlier?



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to say,‚Äù I said, frustrated. ‚ÄúCan‚Ä¶ can you understand me?‚Äù It seemed to acknowledge my request earlier, but the idea that it could understand my words made me deeply uncomfortable. It had no ears, and a human wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear me underwater. But if it could, then perhaps it could tell me how to get out of this place.



The hand gave a thumbs up again.



I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of that. I chose to stop worrying. I was powerless. If the hand, whatever it was, wanted to hurt me, there was nothing I could do about that. But, on the off chance it wanted to help me, I needed to stop being so damn scared and communicate with the thing.



‚ÄúHow do I get out of here?‚Äù I asked softly.



The hand didn‚Äôt move for a while.



‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm sorry I shot at you, I didn‚Äôt mean to, I swear to God,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut you gotta help me out, here. I‚Äôm tired, and I need to get out of the water.‚Äù



The hand still didn‚Äôt move.



‚ÄúFucking figures. You know‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, but just then, I started to hear a noise.



*hmmmmmmmmmm*



It was coming from behind me. I turned around to see a shape moving along the water in my direction. A boat?



I looked back at the hand with a smile on my face. It was gesturing wildly. *Wave* (?), *hide, run away*, *bang*.



I grew tired of the creature‚Äôs game.¬†



*HMMMMMMMMMMM*



The shadow of the boat grew larger as it approached; I saw a kerosene lamp on board, and by its light I could make out the figure of a man waving his arm over his head. Help had arrived.¬†



‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I cried. I began to swim towards the boat.



Suddenly, the hand was in front of me. *Hush*, it gestured. *Run.*



Emboldened by the prospect of freedom, I swam right past it. It didn‚Äôt reach out to touch me, just like it said it wouldn‚Äôt.



I began to have doubts. Was the hand truly trying to help me after all?



No, no. I remembered its little trick underwater with my foot that nearly caused me to shoot my toes off, and its silence when I asked for help. The person on the boat was a man; the thing in the water wasn‚Äôt. Even if this guy wasn‚Äôt of the purest intention, he still had a boat. Worst case scenario, I would commandeer it. I still had the length of wire. In any case, it beat being in the water with this‚Ä¶ thing.



‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I hollered through a mouthful of salt water. The paddling was more than my body could handle. My swimming slowed to a crawl. God, I remember how cold I felt just then, chilled down to the bone. I don‚Äôt think I could have lasted another ten minutes in that water.



I heard a splash.



Underlit by the blue light, like the woman‚Äôs face, I saw a life preserver bobbing in the ripples.



‚ÄúI see you, buddy!‚Äù the man called from the boat. He had a soothing, confident voice, like he wasn‚Äôt worried at all.



With my last vestiges of strength, I swam in long strokes towards the disc, quickly closing the distance.



Just as the ends of my fingers touched the rope laced around the edges of the preserver, the hand appeared again. It gripped the preserver, and began to drag it away from my reach.



‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I shouted helplessly. I tried to follow after it, but I was moving at a snail‚Äôs pace now, my head thundering, my chest heaving up and down, each breath draining traces of salt water into my lungs and stomach. I was starting to drown. It was much more subtle than they make it seem in movies.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, you little bastard!‚Äù the man hollered, and then came the blast of a shotgun. Reflexively I ducked my head underwater. Thousands of the little blue creatures drifted around me in that peaceful moment. I looked down at my body. I was still intact‚Äìnot a single hole in me, and no pain.



I popped my head above the surface and saw that the hand was gone.



The life preserver, though, was still too far for me to reach.



My head dipped back underwater again, this time without my permission. But I was powerless to fight it. I was beginning to sink.



A peace fell over me. All the glowing creatures around me seemed to close in, and then dim, slowly, slowly, until it was as dark as before they arrived. Perhaps I would find out how deep the pool went, after all. Frankly, it was a better ending than I deserved. So of course, I didn‚Äôt get it.



I felt a hand grab mine.



When I awoke, I was aboard the boat. I was wearing several layers of clothing now, dry clothing, and I could see by the glow of the lamp that the boat‚Äôs captain was seated across from me, reloading his shotgun and looking anxiously at me as I stirred.



‚ÄúOh, thank god,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú I thought I did all that mouth-to-mouth for nothing.‚Äù Then he laughed, a hearty belly laugh.



I sat up slowly. My head was still pounding, and I was shaking from the cold, but I could feel the tingle of my nerves in my extremities, and I knew that I would be okay after a while.



‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I managed. I didn‚Äôt like needing help. It wasn‚Äôt something I was used to.



I coughed. My throat was sore from the salt water. That was weird to me. Growing up, my mom would make me gargle salt water to *treat* a sore throat. I guess there‚Äôs a big difference between gargling and drinking.



‚ÄúListen, try to stay close to the lamp, alright?‚Äù he said. I nodded and shuffled closer to it.



There was a sizzling sound. Through the lamplight I could see that the captain had a small gas stove set up in the corner, and he was frying something in a mini cast iron pan.



‚ÄúI got some fish in the cooler I‚Äôm about to fry up, if you want some,‚Äù he offered. ‚Äú This here is for me though. Appetizer.‚Äù



Whatever it was, it smelled delicious. Eating hadn‚Äôt even crossed my mind in the water, but I realized then that I was absolutely starving. It felt like an eternity ago that I had walked down the employee hallway and opened the mysterious black door.



The captain poured what looked like a handful‚Äôs worth of nuts into a bowl and blew on them to cool.



‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad I came by when I did,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat thing in the water‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúI woulda f-figured it out,‚Äù I stuttered. ""But I‚Äôm glad you did, too.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou were bluer than the algae when I pulled you up,‚Äù he laughed, but I didn‚Äôt laugh along; I didn‚Äôt really want to think about it. I was warm now, at least.



‚ÄúListen, I know you probably just want to rest but, I gotta ask: how the hell did you end up all the way out here?‚Äù



‚ÄúLong story,‚Äù I said simply.



‚ÄúWe got time,‚Äù he said.



‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù



‚ÄúWelp‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs up to you, I guess. I was headed north, up towards the island, but I suppose if you wanted me to I could take you south back home.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt sound thrilled about the idea, but I nearly leapt out of my seat. I would‚Äôve, too, if it wasn‚Äôt for a throbbing pain in my foot when I put pressure on it.



‚ÄúCould you really? I-I‚Äôm dying to get out of here, man. Please.‚Äù I sounded more desperate than I wanted, but it was hard to contain it.¬†



‚ÄúYou got it, brotha,‚Äù he said, and with a swift maneuver of the on-board engine, he turned the boat around and started us on our way.



I felt the wind blowing through my hair as we cut through the darkness. The boat bounced up and down, slapping against the water in a rhythmic hum. I remembered the hand‚Äôs first obtuse gesture, the *wave*, and I suddenly understood it: *boat*. The message finally clicked.¬†



*Hide and run from the boat, he has a gun*.



Clearly, that was a warning only the creature needed to heed. If the hand had its way, I would be drowned by now. I looked over the sides of the boat to see if I could make out any figures following us in the glowing blue water, but I couldn‚Äôt. *Good riddance*, I thought.



The nuts had apparently cooled, so the captain took them in his hand and threw one back with a loud *CRUNCH*.



My stomach grumbled. My foot ached, a little more than everything else. I must‚Äôve hit it on something when the captain pulled me into the boat. I couldn‚Äôt be mad at the guy.



‚ÄúYou think you could manage that story, now?‚Äù he asked me, an eyebrow raised.



So I told him. I told him everything I told you all in my first post, about the job, the woman, the room. He just listened quietly, nodding along.¬†



‚ÄúSo, you were going to kill that blonde woman, huh?‚Äù he asked.



I didn‚Äôt know he knew her. I figured she was as much of an interloper in this weird place as I was.



‚ÄúYeah. Just business. Nothing personal,‚Äù I said, hoping she wasn‚Äôt his wife or something.



‚ÄúI wish you woulda killed her,‚Äù he grumbled.



Huh. Not only did he know her, but he wanted her dead, too. I was relieved.



‚ÄúI tried,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect‚Ä¶ this.‚Äù



I looked overboard and saw that the algae had dispersed, and the water was once again dark. The lamp was the only light.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying too, man.‚Äù



‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶ kill? That woman?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh yeah. Every week I‚Äôm out here hunting for her. But that fucking hand‚Ä¶ they communicate with each other. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre friends or something. Every time I think I found her, she disappears.‚Äù He sighed and threw back another nut with a *CRUNCH,* even louder this time.



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúWhy does the hand help her, or why am I trying to kill her?‚Äù



‚ÄúBoth, I guess.‚Äù



‚ÄúShe helped the hand, and now it helps her. That‚Äôs all I know, really. As far as my hunting her‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs complicated,‚Äù he said with a shrug.



‚ÄúWe got time,‚Äù I reminded him. He smiled.



‚ÄúNot much more. We‚Äôre just about here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll you really need to know is that they put me here to protect the island, and she‚Äôs a threat.‚Äù



He turned off the engine. We slowed down to a stop in the water.



‚ÄúAre we here?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúAlmost,‚Äù he said thoughtfully. ‚ÄúYou know something, man?‚Äù



I looked around at the darkness, hoping to find the light of the doorway somewhere in it. Why did we stop short? Did he really know where the exit was exactly, or would I have to find it myself? As long as I didn‚Äôt have to get back in the water‚Ä¶



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I replied absently.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just us out here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn all this dark.‚Äù



I looked at him. He was just sitting there looking back. I studied him: he had broad shoulders, 5‚Äôo‚Äôclock shadow, and a dark coat on. His hand was still cupped holding the roasted nuts, and he threw another back. He looked like anyone else back home; like any guy on the street.



I also noticed that the gun he had been cleaning before was now resting casually on his knee, pointed straight at me.



‚ÄúIs it really? Aren‚Äôt there other people in this place?‚Äù I asked, as calmly as possible.



‚ÄúMaybe. But for now, out here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just us. You know something else?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



‚ÄúI could do anything I want to you right now, and no one could stop me.‚Äù



I didn‚Äôt move. I focused on keeping my breath even. I just smiled at him politely.



‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúAnything I want. Like I said. Don‚Äôt you listen?‚Äù he said. He was talking just like before, no change in his tone. Just like any guy on the street.



‚ÄúTake off your sock,‚Äù he demanded quietly.



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù



‚ÄúBecause I asked you to.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe one that‚Äôs been hurting you.‚Äù



I reached down cautiously to my left foot and peeled off the sock he had placed over it while I had been asleep.



Beneath, it was a mess of blood. My toes, or rather, the place they had been, was wrapped in seeping red bandages. As I realized the extent of the injury, the pain came rushing in. My entire leg throbbed.



The captain threw back another ‚Äúnut‚Äù with an even louder ***CRUNCH***.



He laughed, a deep belly laugh. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a great moment?‚Äù he said. He extended the last toe to me. ‚ÄúHere, I saved the big one for you.‚Äù He laughed again.



I laughed too. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do.¬†



‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. I couldn‚Äôt understand.¬†



I had no desire to scream. I wasn‚Äôt really all that afraid, even; just like in the water, my body had accepted that I was going to die. In my line of work, every job is a chance at death, so life doesn‚Äôt mean so much. All I really wanted to understand was why this was happening‚Äìwhy wouldn't he let me go home?



‚ÄúThey used to let me eat the escapees, but not anymore. I still got a taste for it. Consider it your toll,‚Äù he said casually.



‚ÄúNo, you fucking monster,‚Äù I growled, ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I leave?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, that. Well, here‚Äôs the deal: I don‚Äôt protect the island by keeping people out,‚Äù the captain said. ‚ÄúI keep ‚Äòem in.‚Äù



I set my foot back down on the ground. It flashed with pain as the bandages made contact with the wood.



‚ÄúLook real close,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSee, way out there?‚Äù



I looked out in the distance. At first, I saw nothing. But after a few moments, I started to make out a light against the darkness‚Äìjust a small pinpoint of yellow.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Island. I figured I‚Äôd give you just a glimpse, since you came so far. That‚Äôs where your blonde friend‚Äôs from.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy-‚Äù I began, fighting down a wave of pain, ‚Äú-don‚Äôt you just let me go to the Island?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat, so I can have another blonde bitch clone to give me trouble? Listen, if you‚Äôd have killed her, I would‚Äôve let you go to the island toll free‚Äìhell, I might‚Äôve even let you go home‚Äìbut you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú So now, it‚Äôs time to tie up loose ends.‚Äù



I squinted as he brought the shotgun up out of his lap and leveled it at me.



Then I heard a clatter.



I glanced down. It was my gun.



The captain and I looked overboard simultaneously.



There was the hand, poking out of the water. I could barely see it by the lamplight.



It pointed a finger gun at the captain and dropped the hammer. *Bang*. Then it was gone.



I had the hand‚Äôs message all wrong. It was the same message it probably told the blonde woman as she swam away from the island: *If the* ***boat*** *comes:* ***hide****,* ***run****, and when all else fails‚Ä¶* ***Bang***.



The captain and I both looked down at the gun again. Then I sprang for it.



I had the gun in my hand when I felt a peppering of buckshot in my right shoulder.



The blast was deafening. Weak and disoriented already, my head swam and my ears rang at the sound.



The kerosene lamp fell. I heard it shatter on the ground as the boat descended into darkness.



I switched the pistol to my left hand. I had no idea where the captain was, nor if the pistol would fire a second time, but I pulled the trigger anyway.



Another blind shot.



*Bang.*



I knew I hit him when I heard the splatter of his brain on the hull.



Whether or not the captain was dead.. I couldn‚Äôt know.



*Try not to let it find you*.



The *it* wasn‚Äôt the hand, after all; it was the captain and his hunting boat.



All was quiet for a long moment. I lowered my pistol to my side, placing it in my jacket pocket. It was hard to believe I almost didn‚Äôt take it along with me.



But then, I heard a horrible wail. It was a long, wretched cry of mourning, neither masculine nor feminine.



It was coming from the Island.



Immediately, I heard something approaching quickly from my left.



It started as a low grumble, and slowly swelled into a thunderous roar.



I ducked down, holding tightly to the rib of the boat. It was a wave. I could feel the waters shifting beneath me long before it arrived.



The water folded on top of me with unimaginable force. The small boat didn‚Äôt stand a chance‚ÄìI was torn free and tossed helplessly through the black waters. Everything was a swirl of motion. I reared up out of the water to catch my breath, only to be beaten back under by another wave, and another, until I was certain that I would never surface again.¬†



In the tumult, I caught glimpses of the pinpoint of yellow light growing brighter and brighter, like sun shining down on me, or perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel.



I‚Äôm certain that I felt a hand tugging at my collar, but at what point, and whose, I couldn‚Äôt possibly say.



When I awoke, I was lying on the shores of the Island.",9,1749436724.0,nosleep,6,0.85,False

No more fumbling with batteries because it charges via USB, which is super convenient whether I‚Äôm at home or traveling. The stainless steel whisk is really powerful and fast, but surprisingly quiet too.

I‚Äôve also used it for whisking eggs and mixing protein shakes, it‚Äôs way more versatile than I expected. Plus, it‚Äôs easy to clean; just detach the whisk and rinse it off.

If you love caf√©-quality foam without the fancy machine, this little gadget is totally worth it.

I wanted to thank the community for all the previous reports and tips. My family recently went on a trip to Kyoto (May 2025) with the help of all the intel here. 

We planned for Osaka and Nara too but rolled with the vibes and stayed in Kyoto the whole time. We live about 6hrs flight from Japan so hope to return multiple times. 

Here is our itinerary, in case it‚Äôs helpful for other parents. 

We optimized for:

(1) kids having fun - which means we didn‚Äôt really eat fancy (we ate well, but not fancy) & incorporated lots of kids activities; and

(2) convenience for us - which means lots of taxis. We didn‚Äôt use public transport within Kyoto with two small kids as the city is overrun with tourists. 

Our favorite activities were Kyoto Railway Museum, Ryoan-Ji, Bamboo trail at Fushimi Inari & walking the river and stepping stones.

1l6trdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l6trdc/i_28m_think_im_marrying_into_a_dead_bedroom_with/,I 28M think I‚Äôm marrying into a dead bedroom with my fiancee F28,"

My fiancee and I are getting married in a matter of weeks and I think I‚Äôm finally starting to realize how fucked I am. We met in high school but didn‚Äôt know each other too well, had some light hookups right before we went off to college, and started an LDR while we were at school. We didn‚Äôt talk about sex or intimacy too much but we at least tried to make some use of the brief visits or holidays we had together, though they weren‚Äôt especially frequent. Early on, she set boundaries about things like nudes or phone sex that she wasn‚Äôt very comfortable with stuff like that - I never pushed. I remember when we‚Äôd been dating less than a year, she talked me into sneaking out on my campus late at night for an outside encounter. When we both came home for the summer, it felt like there was never any time where we were just alone - we both worked and she spent a lot of time with her family, I wasn‚Äôt great at being clear and honest about what I wanted. To an extent, this is a big part of the problem - I‚Äôm always scared to inconvenience or annoy people by needing things. But I figured, there were reasonable explanations and factors that make alone time difficult. So I left it alone.

Four years of college went by, I assumed that maybe intimacy would be easier when we were both home, we‚Äôd see each other more regularly, have more excuses to hang out alone since our relationship was clearly serious and committed, that sort of thing. I was wrong. We rarely got true alone time since she was always saying how uncomfortable she was having sex with other people in the house, wherever we were. Then I moved out of my childhood home to live by myself - really I was forced out. She wasn‚Äôt ready to move away from her parents because of COVID and the uncertain economy, and the timetable on my move was really fast and unexpected, so we couldn‚Äôt really move in together right away. Even so, I thought, surely now that we at least have a place where we are guaranteed to have however much alone time we need, we‚Äôll have some more activity together. If anything, we started having any form of anything more serious than kissing even less. Once every month or so became once every two months. I figured, we still spend a lot of time around her family. I just kept making excuses, even though I was struggling so much with the lack of intimacy. Then she moved out to an apartment with roommates, and despite the fact that it felt like we were getting a lot more privacy in general, I think it only really served to show me just how frequently we spent alone time together without any form of physical connection beyond cuddling and light kissing. 

Throughout the course of our relationship, I would sometimes voice my concerns about how little sexual activity we shared, and she would always agree with my concerns while assuring me that things would be different when we moved in together, we would have a lot more opportunities and privacy, we could try to explore things, maybe try to incorporate toys or other aspects to try and make sex more exciting and fun. I thought that meant that she honestly believed that things would change. I‚Äôd spent years being patient about our relationship because of long distance complications and everything, what was just a little longer?

Fast forward to late 2022, we finally got a chance to move in together and took it. We‚Äôd been talking about living together for a while, and we got a nice apartment together. Moving in was a bit of a whirlwind, and adjusting to living together full time was definitely a bit of a struggle, but I imagine it was no worse than what most couples who finally get to see each others‚Äô living habits after years of knowing one another experience. In any case, once we finally settled in, I thought, maybe now, finally, there could be a substantial increase in our intimacy and sexual relationship. I was wrong.

In the two and a half years we‚Äôve been living together, I think we‚Äôve had full-on sex maybe 5 or 6 times total, and only a few more times of ‚Äúother‚Äù activities. She barely even seems to like kissing me, as she‚Äôll sometimes get annoyed when I just want to sit with her and do light kissing. Even when I make it clear that I would be a little happier if we just made out a bit more once in a while, she insists that she doesn‚Äôt want to give mixed signals or let things escalate into something she doesn‚Äôt want to do - so even kissing is an issue in a decade-long relationship. In terms of the sex itself, it isn‚Äôt even that great. I try my best to be an attentive and generous partner, but it‚Äôs like she actively dislikes getting off. She doesn‚Äôt do very much to engage actively in sex, and will discourage me from trying to give her oral or my fingers otherwise, and she won‚Äôt do anything to me unless I ask for it or instruct her to. Initial penetration is always complicated because it seems to hurt her, and when I‚Äôve said she should talk to her gyno or do some research on conditions she‚Äôs waved me off and never done anything about it. If this is why she doesn‚Äôt want to have sex - that it doesn‚Äôt feel very good for her or she just doesn‚Äôt experience much pleasure - then I could understand, if it didn‚Äôt seem like there was some sort of underlying issue causing these things, on top of the fact that her general attitude about sex isn‚Äôt good to begin with. She doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why it bothers me that she doesn‚Äôt actively seek out sex with me - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind doing it if you ask!‚Äù (Which isn‚Äôt even true, since a lot of the times when I ask ahead of time or try to schedule sex, it gets forgotten). 

In the meantime, I do my best to be a dutiful partner. I take care of almost all of our chores, I take care of her when she‚Äôs sick, I cook most nights, I make her lunch and coffee for when she goes to work, I take her on date nights, buy flowers, encourage her to spend time with her friends, hold her when she cries, talk her through her frequent episodes of anxiety and depression, whatever I can do. I love this woman with all my heart and the biggest thing I want is for her to be happy and to have the capacity to make her happy.

I‚Äôve brought up several times how awful all of this makes me feel - I feel unattractive, I feel like my needs aren‚Äôt important, I feel like I do so much for her without regard for myself, I feel like if I never asked for sex that it wouldn‚Äôt happen at all, and that if that was true that it wouldn‚Äôt even bother her. Every time we talk about it, she‚Äôs receptive and understanding and talks about feeling bad or guilty - she knows how much I want more sex and she knows she doesn‚Äôt give me enough of it. Of course, then I just feel shitty for needing something from her. But now, with our wedding coming up in a pretty short time frame, I think I‚Äôm finally coming to accept that it was only ever going to get worse. 

It clicked for me the last time we talked about sex. I was talking about how we used to do a lot of things differently when we were younger, and how I feel lately that she sees sex as more of a chore than something fun to enjoy with me. I asked if she remembered the night we snuck around campus where she pulled me out of sight and we had some fun in a pretty public spot - she gave me an incredulous look and said that she was young and stupid and had just been trying to impress me. It hit me then, the realization that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever really enjoyed sex and has only ever engaged in sexual activity with me for my benefit. She claims she isn‚Äôt asexual, but I‚Äôm really just not convinced.

The thing is, I love her to death for a lot of reasons outside of sex, and I‚Äôve always been deeply ashamed of my sex drive and desire for physical intimacy. I had deep-seated self esteem issues in high school, and she was the first - and only - girl I had ever hooked up with casually. I was used to a lot of rejection from girls in high school, and it made me feel like my want for sex was a shameful and bad thing for me to indulge - that I shouldn‚Äôt try to end a serious and committed relationship just because I want to get my dick wet more often. I felt that if I was just patient and considered all the reasonable explanations for decreased sexual activity, that at some point some magic switch would be flipped and we‚Äôd be fucking like rabbits. Well, I think a switch has been flipped - the one where the lights come on and I finally see how I‚Äôve been lying to myself for years, that I knew it was never going to be better, but I allowed myself to be convinced that it was *okay* for me to ignore my own wants and needs so that I wouldn‚Äôt be a burden.

Reddit, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to just leave her, especially now that the wedding is so close. I also don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to live the rest of my life believing, I‚Äôll get sex three times a year at the absolute best for the next couple, then probably after we have a kid or two basically never. 

ETA: I realize this post probably makes it seem like I have a very high opinion of myself or like I‚Äôm doing nothing wrong. I‚Äôm well aware of the fact that I could just be doing something wrong or that just because I talk about how nice I am to take out the trash and do dishes that I don‚Äôt just deserve sex. I just don‚Äôt want people to read this post and think that I must assume I‚Äôm perfect and don‚Äôt do anything wrong.",0,1749436459.0,relationship_advice,22,0.4,False
1l6tqu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l6tqu2/the_barista_at_my_favorite_coffee_shop_wont_say/,"The barista at my favorite coffee shop won‚Äôt say my name, even though we went to high school together.","There‚Äôs a coffee shop downtown next to the park. If you go there at the right time, you can avoid the early morning rush. But arrive too late? You‚Äôre stuck behind a long line of hipsters.

I like the place because it‚Äôs five minutes from my apartment. Just a straight walk out the door and a few minutes later, I‚Äôm sipping the best latte in Southern California.

But the one thing that irks me about the place is the barista, Steve.

He never remembers my name, even though we went to high school together. I mean, sure. People drift apart. Times change. But we were close for a couple years, until he transferred out to another school.

It just seemed odd to reconnect and‚Ä¶no matter how many times I reminded him‚Ä¶he never recalled my name.¬†

This whole ordeal started last summer. I had just accepted a new job and was eager to impress my boss. I hustled into the cafe, workbag slung over my shoulder, and heard: ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

I recognized the voice instantly. ‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù¬†

Sure enough, Steve was behind the counter, making drinks. He still had that trademark curly hair and thick glasses, like he was straight out of Silicon Valley.

‚ÄúNice to see you, man‚Ä¶‚Äù

We made our reintroductions, and I ordered. Everything seemed normal at first, but when he went to write down my name, he hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. How could I forget?‚Äù

He wrote it down and I paid. That was that.¬†

Weeks turned into months. Steve was there almost every morning. Each time, I‚Äôd have to remind him as confusion spread across his face. ¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Harry, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Silly me.‚Äù

He‚Äôd scribble my name on the cup, and I‚Äôd play it off. But if I was being honest, it bothered me. And the more it happened, the angrier I got.

One day, I built up enough courage to ask him: ‚ÄúSteve, what‚Äôs going on, man? We‚Äôve interacted for, like, three months. You still don‚Äôt remember my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe hung out every day in high school.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah. Trippy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs pretty odd.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be a confusing name.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand your frustration. I‚Äôll do better. I promise.‚Äù

I left the shop, annoyed, but satisfied that he‚Äôd sworn to try harder.

That promise didn‚Äôt last long.

The next day, the same thing happened. I was so irritated!¬†

I decided to confront Steve, once and for all, but this time, outside the coffee shop.

I waited in the park across the street. Watched him exit the cafe at four fifteen.¬†

He must‚Äôve lived nearby because he didn‚Äôt climb into any cars or call a rideshare. He just slung his backpack over his shoulder, headed for downtown.¬†

I trailed him for about five blocks when I finally called out. ‚ÄúSteve!‚Äù

He stopped and raked his gaze toward me. ‚ÄúHey! It‚Äôs ‚Äî‚Äù

And then it happened‚Ä¶his mind blanked.

‚Äú‚Äî Harry!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúRight. Right. I‚Äôm sorry. What‚Äôs up, Bud?‚Äù

I hurried to his position, doing my best to act calm.

‚ÄúLook, Steve, this might not be a big deal, but I have to ask. What‚Äôs with the name thing?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe name thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you remember my name?!‚Äù

At this, Steve‚Äôs eyes widened and his lips twitched. He arched his back like he was in severe pain.

‚ÄúSteve, you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù His voice sounded strange, robotic. ‚ÄúWhat were you asking me?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just weird that I‚Äôve been coming to your shop for four months. Every time I order you forget my name. I have to remind you each time. I just wanted to know‚Ä¶are you trolling me? Did I piss you off in high school and now you‚Äôre getting back at me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù Steve said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that at all. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù

He started hitting his chest, like he was having a panic attack.¬†

‚ÄúSteve, relax. I didn‚Äôt mean to freak you out‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYour name is Harry. Your name is Harry. Your name is Harry.‚Äù

‚ÄúSteve! Chill!‚Äù

‚ÄúYournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.‚Äù

I grabbed Steve‚Äôs arm, trying to calm him.¬†

But he tore free, started running in a circle.

I backed away. My voice soft and measured.

‚ÄúLook, Steve. I‚Äôm sorry I stressed you out. Let‚Äôs forget we had this conversation.‚Äù

I disappeared around the corner. I could still hear him repeating:

‚ÄúYournameisHarry. YournameisHarry. YournameisHarry.‚Äù

***

That night, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted. Flopped onto the couch. Opened my computer to catch up on work.¬†

All I could think about was Steve‚Äôs reaction. What the hell was wrong with him?

After finishing my work, I showered, got ready for bed, and turned on the TV to stream a movie. God knows how long I watched it before falling asleep.

Sometime later, I jerked awake to the sound of movement in the kitchen.

PFT-PFT-PFT. It resembled footsteps, shifting along the tile of my dining room.¬†

PFT-PFT-PFT. I glanced at the ceiling. Was it my upstairs neighbor? No.

I glanced at the clock: 2:30 am. ¬†

PFT-PFT-PFT. The hell?

I grabbed the golf club near my bed, ventured to my doorway, sweating.¬†

The strange movements accelerated.

I wondered if it was a rat, searching for food. ¬†

‚ÄúHello? Anyone in here?‚Äù

I flipped on my kitchen light in the hall. ¬†

CLICK. The entire kitchen and dining area lit up.

I searched every corner of the apartment. Opened each drawer and cabinet, wondering: what was that? A mouse? A bat?

I didn‚Äôt find anything, so I shut off the lights. Went back to bed. But this time‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶I placed the golf club a little closer to my nightstand‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and plugged in a nightlight for good measure‚Ä¶¬†

It was a few hours later when I awoke to more sounds in my bedroom. ¬†

PFT-PFT-PFT. PFT-PFT-PFT.

I opened my eyes. A humanoid shape stood at the end of my bed. Breathing heavily.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I gasped, my voice tight with fear. Then ‚Äî¬†

CREAK. The shape lowered itself onto the bed.¬†

I reached for my club. But a firm hand gripped my wrist.

Another slapped down over my mouth, silencing me.¬†

There was just enough glow from my nightlight to make out the intruder‚Äôs face ‚Äî ¬†

‚Äî it was Steve ‚Äî¬†

I'm flying in and out of Medellin. So far, I'm planning around 4 days for Medellin (day trip to Guatape or Santa Fe de Antioquia?), 3 days for Bogot√°, 4 nights for Leticia to do an Amazon excursion and then 3-4 days for Armenia / coffee region. 

Basic things I'd want to do:

-Street art tour

-Check out a few art museums

-Take the cable cars

-Do a coffee tour

-visit Cocora valley

-watch a soccer game (if possible)

I'm primarily a city person who likes art and cultural attractions but I do like going into nature from time to time (hence, the Amazon excursion). I love coffee so definitely want to do a coffee tour at a farm. In general, I like checking out cool cafes, restaurants, sports games and do some shopping. 

Does this seem like a reasonable itinerary? Is there anything I'm missing? Any day trips I should take from any of the major cities? I'd plan on flying between the cities. 

Also I like to take photos with my Fujifilm DSLR but I heard Colombia isn't the safest of places to be carrying around expensive equipment. Should I leave the camera at home?

You can't just ask ""how much does a website cost?"" and get one answer.

The problem is, lots of people starting out get totally confused asking this question. They get quotes all over the place, from a few hundred bucks to literally tens of thousands. It feels random and unfair, and you have no idea what you should actually be paying.

The solution is realizing that website cost depends on *so many* things. Is it just a simple page about your business, or does it need a shopping cart, user logins, or fancy animations? How many pages do you need? Do you want a super unique custom design or is a tweaked template okay? Are you hiring a student or a top-tier agency? All this stuff changes the price big time.

So, instead of asking for *the* price, figure out what *your* website needs to do. Write down your goals, the features you want, and maybe list competitors' sites you like. Then you can explain this to designers when you ask for a quote.

If you do this, you'll get quotes that actually make sense for what you need. You can compare apples to apples and budget way more accurately without getting ripped off or underspending on something that won't work.

Now, you just need help figuring out what you need or finding the right designer. Comment FIVERR and I'll send you my simple guide on figuring out your website requirements so you know exactly what to ask for.

Hey there!

I'm a 27-year-old guy from Texas, been having a pretty good week and thought I'd try to meet someone new before a new work wave takes my time up. Feel free to tell me how your day has been going, I think it's a pretty good conversation starter. Happy to talk about hobbies we both like or enjoy! Some stuff I like is Reading, games, working out, old shows, and cooking!

About me:

* I Like to take life easy, sometimes I focus a little too much on work but I like to try new fun things and learn more about them.
* Into music, gaming, good coffee, exploring new shows or books, and always up for learning something new.
* looking for someone who‚Äôs open-minded, kind, and not afraid of a good conversation. Whether you're local to Texas or just online, let‚Äôs see where things go.

So... how‚Äôs your day going? üòä",1,1749435993.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1l6tlx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1l6tlx1/rough_weekend_on_a_group_trip/,Rough weekend on a group trip,"I had a really rough weekend and I think it would be helpful to share it...

My boyfriend extended an invitation this weekend for a camping trip. His best friend and his wife invited us, I've hing out with them a few times and they make an effort to socialize with me. I was excited. They were also going to take care of the food since it was their camp, I thought I didn't have to worry.

I was excited for the weekend. Every other time I've gone camping there is hiking, swimming, or other activities... I had a couple bags so that I had whatever I needed. I literally bought a new bathing suit and bag I was so excited.

As soon as we got there my stomach flipped, it wasn't just us. There was another couple there that I had met once before, they were older and welcoming but I wasn't prepared for it. Then I find out there is a 4th couple coming, never met them, and they are extremely close with the couple I knew.

As soon as they showed up I just shut down. I sunk into my chair and just laughed along, not that they made an effort to talk to me. It was hard with everyone sharing about their families (I only have my boyfriend), inside jokes, and these past/future group trips that I'm not a part of. They stayed up until 2am and it wasnt my camp so I felt too awkward to go into the shared camper alone. I was so pale and uncomfortable by the time we went to bed... and then find out we basically had no mattress. Plus I didnt realize no one else brought pjs but me and apparently it was expected to just sleep in your clothes. I only slept for 3 hours and couldn't get back to sleep, waiting 4 hours for my boyfriend to wake up so I wouldn't go out alone.

The first morning broke me. I lost my sunglasses and those are like a safety blanket for me, I felt exposed. Then I found out they didn't realize I drank tea and not coffee, so there was no caffeine for me either. And they weren't doing breakfast until noon while I was starving. I was actually fighting tears sitting out with everyone, so when my boyfriend wandered off to get some air I snuck back into my bunk and cried silently.

My boyfriend got me centered and convinced me to come back out. I think that is when people realized I wasn't having the best time. They put more effort into organizing breakfast, one of the husbands made an effort to chat with me a little... my boyfriend then took an opportunity to bring me into town for a tea and some shopping. While we were gone the couple we were sharing the camper with swapped out the padding on our bed so it would be more comfortable, so they must have been able to tell I hadn't slept since I didnt feel comfortable saying it.

I think the hardest part was a combination of spending the weekend with strangers, plus the fact the ones I did know were better friends with the others than with me. So why make an effort with me when their best friends are there? The wife I never met before didn't speak a word to me or even look at me, and neither did the othet wives when she was around.

When we got back he offered me his hammock to hide in and I hung out there until the other women decided to go to town. Oddly enough that was the only time I had fun... the guys joked around with me, I had a water gun fight with my boyfriend, and we actually got to have a quiet talk together.

It was easier to bite my lip for the rest of the day but at night he checked on me... it was hard for him to watch me all day looking either fed up or being on the verge of tears. These people had a different idea of fun, they just wanted to drink and talk all weekend.

But at least this morning I found my sunglasses so I didnt feel so exposed when I went outside. But then came the awkwardness of not knowing what to do when everyone was packing up, no one really told me when we were leaving but they all seemed to just know, I felt in the way. I had thought we'd be spending most of the day. Then of course almost everyone else ended up chatting in one of the campers while I was awkwardly waiting outside not knowing what was going on.

I never felt so relieved to leave and go home. But this weekend drained everything I had in me... on top of being drained I also feel physically sick from the lack of caffeine and inconsistent eating. 

At least it isn't a frequent thing but it makes me sad because my boyfriend often doesn't have much time, so when trips like this come up I worry I'll get excluded. I know he wouldn't do it to be mean but he wouldn't want to put me through this again... and he's leaving for a few months for work so it was really disappointing this is how our last weekend together went.

The silver lining is it made me more appreciativeof my boyfriend. I've been in the dumps because he didnt want me to come on a tropical trip he is taking later this year for a wedding. He originally wanted me to go but then decided against it, I took it personally. He had mentioned I'd only know a couple people there and he had a guys only portion. Now I realize that once he figured me out, he knew I'd have a miserable time just like I did this weekend... I'd be in a foreign country for a week and surrounded by people I don't know while he goes off with his friends.",2,1749435976.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Tried one of those whitening foam toothpastes from a random shop and it‚Äôs surprisingly solid. The 5D whitening claim sounded gimmicky, but after a week of daily use, my teeth look noticeably brighter, especially where coffee stains usually hang out.

Bonus: it doubles as mouthwash when I‚Äôm in a rush. Mint flavor is fresh but not overpowering, and it‚Äôs way less messy than a regular tube.
