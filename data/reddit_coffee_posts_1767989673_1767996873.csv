Why?  Why do you care?  You’re just as much.  Yet you let yourself down.

Because you just don’t know doesn’t mean it isn’t.

Believe.  Faith.

In solitude?  Perhaps more than ever yes.  Yes in silence.  Yes just you.  For you are more, than enough good.  You’re better than good.  You’re limitless.  Indefinable.  

Quit labeling you.  Stop that.  Stop.  Enough is enough.  You’re tired of this shit.  So listen.

You’re surrounded by idiots.  But once you realize they’re not to blame you just don’t give any fucks about drama anymore.  Fucks only given to meaning.

Now, go.  Be you.  Live that life.  No one needs to see you.  Until they see you.  When it happens.  If it does.  Many will suddenly see you at once.  It was you, all along. All alone.  Solo.  Just you.  See?

In fact I was so excited to play, I grew impatient at the intro because the dude wouldn't let me roam free (I don't think that was a design flaw, I was just so excited).

Anyway, from a lifetime fan, here's my pros + cons:

- Imho the city should have had at least some hidden sections and/or variety between areas to at least make us think we're exploring something new. E.g. slums vs rich areas, rooftops that actually lead to cool interior spaces, anything to make sure you still have things to discover as you go along. Having said that I'm not done with the game yet so maybe this happens later on? Here's to hoping!!

- I love the Pokémon options, adore the battle style, and the grind, it took some getting used to but, honestly, great stuff.

- Alphas are still here 😍

- the rank skip was absolute BULL. I was so sad to miss out on just grinding through the ranks. Shame.

- I'm such a girl but honestly, the clothes 👌 A++++

- they really made a kid friendly Paris as close to real Paris as they could get. I love that Pokémon love you when you take them out for coffee 😭💕

- Compared to Arceus the story is Oscar worthy.

Finally, did anyone else think the ""teen proposing to a fresh off the boat teen to participate in a promotional photoshoot and then go to some weird hotel with them"" + the pretend robbery was too close to how human trafficking works, or have I just watched too much law and order?

Anyway, regardless of flaws I'm really happy with this game, it's fun, new, and I'm 100% progressing as slowly as possible as I don't want it to end.",1,1767996646.0,LegendsZA,0,1.0,False

Thrilled it's back. but seemed to me somewhat sophomoric and flattened out.,"While I was thrilled to be reunited with the characters, the showrunners or producers seem to have, for lack of a better word, flattened out The Pitt, most likely to be more easily digestible, appealing to a broader audience. >!The dialogue appears overall to be slower by 2/3 than in Season 1, the characters seem to becoming caricatures of themselves (which doesn't usually happen in excellent series until a Season 3), and, to me, the gore was gratuitous, which was rarely the case in Season 1, where it was simply brutally graphic and realistic.!<

>!Noah Wiley is still very good--but no way the Season 1 version of his character would be so prissy and hissy about the returning doctor from rehab--refusing to speak to him and punishing him by sticking in triage.!<

>!The doc returning from rehab would never in a trillion years (and no, making amends doesn't mean this in recovery) confess to a crime to a patient for stealing his meds.!<

>!The introverted charming resident with the glasses is now a parody of herself and now apparently full-blown out-there neurodivergent without any nuance--grimacing, staring into the middle distance, ranting to herself, muttering about the origins of bullying so we ""can see"" how she is affected by the surly resident. Who, now, has had a glow-up, is much more personable and has now been conventionalized to simply be ""confident"" and slightly ""untactful,"" rather than brusque, brilliant, insensitive, occassionally inappropriate, and heavily defended--while altho hinting at an intriguing complex interior life--the combination of which making her fascinating and endearing, nonetheless, as she was in Season 1.!<

>!The exchange with the handsome patient and the now-apparently far along the spectrum resident with glasses was very close to a scene from the BBC's ""Patience"" (one of the many series about a neurodivergent person working as a defacto unofficial brilliant detective with and against the police force). In Patience she's at a busstop when a man compliments her. She doesn't understand or acknowledg it. He asks whether she ever drinks coffee. Patiences says no, in fact she doesn't drink caffeine. The man says ""Neither do I! Do you like \_\_\_\_\_?"" (probably not Boba) and Patience says ""Yes!"" and steps on the bus, which drives away. In Season 1 this character in The Pitt was not at all clueless like this. She was sensitive, quiet, thoughtful, perceptive, self-regulating, kind, good-natured, and slightly ""unusual."" but gently and humbly picked up on things others might have missed.!<

>!Her perseverating on ""going to jail"" and muttering ""I need a lawyer"" and spacing out while working is totally off-character. As was bounding up to the returning doc likely a golden retriever puppy, and pouncing on him, patting his arms, ""realizing"" that wasn't quite the right move. In Season 1 she would have been more contained, and if she crossed boundaries it wouldn't have been so extreme and *obvious*. Which is, sadly, the crux of the difference between Ep 1 of Season 2, and all of Season 1: everything is obvious, almost hackneyed.!<

>!The charge nurse seems like a totally different person--quite crass--and where did that New York/Boston accent come from?(!) If the actor is trying to sound like she's from Pittsburgh, that ain't it.!<

>!The nice practical nurse who has the kid (and issue with former husband) has also been dumbed down and stripped of dimension. In Season 1 she never would have said anything to her colleague like ""it's been soooo long"" and ""I gotta get laid - too much for 8am, heh heh?"" She was not coarse and stupid like that in Season 1. She was direct, warm, down-to-earth, and unflinching--but she didn't act like that, especially about her personal life and her emotional/personal state. And no, it's not because ""they know each other now."" The writing is flattened out for easy low-brow laffs. And then, as if we don't get it, the other character has to mutter, for our benefit, in case we weren't sure what we were supposed to think, ""TMI!!"" More LOLs (more like eyeroll)!<

>!The insertion of the new attending is ham-handed and the writing is offensive to viewers of Season 1 in terms of how over-the-top she's being drawn. Again: no nuance, no ambiguity. She's just obnoxious and setting up a, frankly, dumb sort of 2-dimensional conflict--pushy bureaucratic know-it-all new kid on the block literally gets in people's faces and introduces sweeping policy changes 15 minutes into her brand new job--but will win them over bit by bit and...in the process....will learn a li'l something about herself. Come on.!<

>!Not to mention the head-to-toe feces-smeared but merry and otherwise essentially sane funky homeless comic relief foil...no medical issues but gets priority treatment in the shower room overseen by the top nurse.!<

>!And, I'm very far from religious, but there were 3 instances in this first hour of making religious people (Christian/Catholic) look moronic, intolerant, mean-spirited, and/or ignorant--with our characters making heroically upright, socially conscious jabs and snipes about their hidebound toxic beliefs and purported worldviews.!<

>!Overall, the pace in S2 Ep1 seemed jumbled, rather than elegantly frenetic as was always the case in Season 1. The dialogue isn't nearly as sharp, smart, witty, and sophisticated as in Season 1--with it dazzling, far-ranging references from Greek mythology to comic books and popular culture, flying by so fast you might or might not catch 1/2 of them--but which was fine because there were often several other threads happening or being spoken simultaneously, which was a large part of what made Season 1 as stimulating as it was was.!<

>!It seems the showrunners/producer studied analytics and social media and picked the most frequently made comments ""pro"" and ""con"" and tweaked the series to be simpler, more graphic, and with a great deal less ambiguity, complexity, contradictions and paradoxes, depth, and fewer simultaneously occurring layers and emotional and visceral journeys for viewers.!<

>!I will watch Episode 2 and 3, but if it's as watered down as Episode 1, I may not make it through the rest of Season 2. It would be a shame, but these things happen when a Season 1 have been a hit (altho, again, this usually happens after a successful Season 2), and the producers look to turbo-charge viewership and believe they must flatten it out somewhat to do so. When they do, viewership does usually increase, but the early adopters who appreciated the more subtle, original Season 1 are generally somewhat disappointed that it's lost some of its luster.!<",3,1767995991.0,ThePittTVShow,3,0.71,False

One Breath Prayer: Peace Over This Home
---------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, finding peace can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Whether it’s the noise of daily life or the pressures of work and family, tranquility often feels just out of reach. But what if I told you that peace could be as simple as a breath?

In this video, we’re diving deep into the concept of the One Breath Prayer: “Peace Over This Home.” With just a single inhalation and exhalation, we can invite God’s peace into our lives and homes.

Embracing the Power of Prayer
-----------------------------

Imagine coming home after a long day, greeted by the chaos of family life or the solitude of an empty house. In these moments, the One Breath Prayer serves as a powerful reminder of God’s presence and promise. As Jesus states in John 14:27:

> “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.”

This simple yet profound prayer captures our longing for peace. It helps us shift our focus from the distractions of life to the grace of God.

### How to Practice One Breath Prayer

You may wonder how to incorporate this practice into your daily routine. Here are some easy steps to embrace the One Breath Prayer:

1. **Choose a Peaceful Moment**: Whether it’s in the morning with a cup of coffee or at night before you sleep, find a moment of quiet.
2. **Inhale Deeply**: As you breathe in, visualize God’s serene presence filling your home. This can be a transformative moment where you invite peace to dwell at the center of your family life.
3. **Exhale**: As you breathe out, release the tensions, worries, and distractions. Allow the tension to melt away, and feel God’s promise settle into your space.
4. **Repeat**: Say the prayer silently or out loud, “Peace Over This Home,” with each breath. Allow this affirmation to resonate.

By engaging in this practice, you’re not just muttering a phrase; you are actively creating a sanctuary of peace.

Scriptures for Reflection
-------------------------

To deepen your experience, let’s reflect on additional scripture that complements the notion of peace:

- Philippians 4:6-7 reminds us to not be anxious, but to present our requests to God. His peace will guard our hearts and minds.
- Isaiah 26:3 assures us that God keeps in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, trusting in Him.

### Creating a Peace-filled Environment

In addition to the One Breath Prayer, consider ways to nurture peace in your home:

- **Declutter**: A tidy home often leads to a tidy mind.
- **Create Sacred Spaces**: Dedicate a corner of your home for prayer, meditation, or reflection.
- **Play Worship Music**: Surround yourself with uplifting melodies that remind you of God’s promises.

Questions for Your Journey
--------------------------

- When was the last time you felt an overwhelming sense of peace in your home?
- How can the One Breath Prayer transform your daily routine or struggles?

Reflecting on these questions can create deeper insights into your relationship with God and how you interact with your living environment.

Call to Action
--------------

As we conclude our exploration of the One Breath Prayer—”Peace Over This Home”—I encourage you to take a moment to incorporate this practice into your life.

Share your thoughts or experiences in the comments below. How has prayer helped you find peace? Let’s create a dialogue that encourages and uplifts those seeking tranquility in their homes.

May God’s peace envelop you, transforming your home into a haven of serenity. Breathe deeply, pray intentionally, and watch as His presence fills your life.

1q8lpao,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1q8lpao/charging_for_takeaway_cups/,charging for takeaway cups,"heyy,

my boss recently came up with some changes, and this one in particular i can't really agree with. 

in our cafe we use branded to-go cups - we have only two sizes (plus unbranded espresso cups), the cups are both different colors with our logo etc. its actually a really nice design and people like to take photos of the cups. they allegedly cost 30 cents each though.

a common issue i have noticed is certain people demanding to have the coffee in paper cups despite staying in, nevertheless ordering one v60 and wanting 3 paper cups for it, while still eating-in. i understand this is an unnecessary loss for the business and i also hate when they leave the cups on the tables. 

so my boss decided to charge for to-go cups at the price he buys them for - 30c - in our country it ends up about 5 % of the drink price - eg. cappuccino for 85,- upcharge for 5,-.

i honestly dont know any other cafe that does this. i think the usage of branded cups is the decision of the business, thus the cost should be on the business. we dont even have any unbranded cups on the side that could be offered. personally i dont think i would frequent a cafe that did this cuz the cost does add up.

does anyone use this model in their cafe? do people complain? does it work? idk how to feel about it really but maybe im just overthinking it.",1,1767995980.0,barista,7,1.0,False

The issue is that because I live in a cold country and it’s winter right now, I wore the dress with sheer black tights. They are black but sheer so you can see the outline of what it looks like. 

I’m heavily concerned that he did notice it because maybe the tights I wore make it difficult for him to see it. I even wore boots that aren’t high specifically so he can see the scar but I think he didn’t notice it. 

We went to get coffee at a nice cafe and we were having a good conversation, I didn’t want to ruin the vibe by mentioning it so I just wore the dress and I prayed to God that he would notice it but since we sat down most of the time I don’t think he noticed it. We even went to the mall near the cafe we went to and we walked there for a few minutes. I was praying he would notice it so I could get this out of the way but I don’t know if he saw it. 

By the end of the date, he said that he enjoyed meeting me and that we should “do this again”. He also messaged me the day after saying that it was nice meeting me. 

I’m sorry for the long post but I don’t have anyone in my life to get advice from about this, can someone tell me what I should do?",1,1767995917.0,askanything,1,1.0,False

“Und*er a bridge near Little Earth, agents detained four Native American men, all citizens of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, according to tribal President Frank Star Comes Out. At least one of the men has been freed after a 12-hour hold, but the community is unaware of his whereabouts, a community advocate from Homeward Bound, a southside homeless advocacy center, told ICT on Friday.* 

*On Thursday, a Red Lake Nation descendant, Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, was detained by ICE in a northern Minneapolis suburb as he was driving to visit his aunt.*

*Star Comes Out said the tribe’s attorneys have reached out to Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, White Earth Ojibwe, to learn more about where the Oglala Lakota men are being held. The names of the four men are not yet available.* 

*\[…\]*

*Ramirez, the Red Lake man, was detained by ICE sometime after calling his aunt at 11 a.m. Thursday to tell her he was being followed by a black Ford SUV with at least four men inside, according to his aunt, Shawntia Sosa-Clara. Ramirez was driving to visit Sosa-Clark at her home in Crystal, Minnesota, directly outside of Minneapolis.”*

**Also from the article:**

“*Early Friday morning, ICE agents attempted to detain another Native American community member, Rachel Dionne-Thunder, co-founder of the Indigenous Peoples’ Movement, who was sitting in her car down the street from the Powwow Grounds coffee shop.*

*Coffee shop workers told ICT they ran outside to stop the agents and protect Dionne-Thunder, who recorded the incident on Facebook live.”*

I recently purchased a brand new Mahlkonig E64 WS and have been having issues with it straight out of the box. The main issue is that the spout doesn't stay at the angle I set it and it slowly slides down, causing the coffee grinds to pile up and not spread evenly within the portafilter.

You can see how the spout slowly slid down in the first few seconds of grinding in the video. This overfilling at the edge forces me to awkwardly shake my portafilter to make sure I don't spill any coffee grounds, but most times I do end up spilling it and create a mess.

At first, I thought it was because I was using a 54mm portafilter, but I had a friend bring his 58mm portafilter and I was having the same problem.

I also thought maybe the scale wasn't calibrated and was grinding too much coffee causing overfilling, but I made sure to test that and ruled that possibility out as well.

I regularly use an E80W GbW at the coffee shop I work at and have never had this issue of overfilling the portafilter.

Would really appreciate any sort of guidance or advice anyone might have for me.

Thanks!

I’ve seen a lot of chatter about a certain Finch ad floating around recently that’s had a lot of you wondering: *“Where is this declutter challenge happening?”* 👀

Here’s the thing: there isn’t an in-app challenge tied to this ad — it was just a fun (albeit confusing) ad to inspire you to declutter. Curiosity and inquiry around the “challenge” has inspired us to perhaps actually do a challenge like this in-app, one day. Until that day, though, I’ve put together a challenge just for our community! 🫶

🧺 **Introducing your 13-Day Declutter Challenge!** 🧺

Over the next 13 days, feel free to participate in one approachable declutter task each day. Nothing intense, just simple, low-pressure steps to help bring a little more calm and clarity into your space.

📝 You’re welcome to:

* Create a goal based on the challenge for the day
* Use a Self-Care Area to track all 13 days (and earn more stones!)
* Do the whole task… or just part of it (both count!)

I hope this community challenge is fun and inspiring, and helps you start the new-year off without as much clutter in your mental, emotional, and physical space. Enjoy! ❤️

I have the Casabrews Ultra machine and I love it! We have been using pre-ground coffee for the past several months and I've been really enjoying our coffee; however, I wanted to venture into buying whole coffee beans, maybe start buying fancier coffee, and really dial in our shots. So my normal order of operations with my pre-ground coffee beans (Don Francisco's Coffee, Vanilla Nut) was to use the ""dual wall two cup"" basket thingy, I put 14g of the grounds in there, level it, tamp it, and then I press the 2 cup button. TBH i haven't weighed the yield when I do that normal process but the coffee tastes great, so no complaints from me!

So I got some whole beans from Trader Joes and started using our new coffee grinder - Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill, and i played around with the grind settings, but all my shots have been sort of watery and the yield is like insanely high. First of all, I can't fit 18g of grounds in my portafilter, it doesn't fit when I put in on the machine - I feel like I have to like really yank it and pull it in order for it to be in the right position. Also, I don't have a pressurized tamper thingy so I'm sure that's a factor as well. So I tried 16g and I got like 87g after the shot was pulled which is obviously too much and obviously too watery. I'm just not sure what the right balance is.

The most popular oils are black seed, castor, moringa seed, shea butter, pumpkin seed and coffee oil and many others for the cosmetic industry.

The demand is there for the domestic market but as one of our goals is to get to exporting as soon as possible as we know there is a market with great margins and the search for dollars. We have been on some trade shows and bazaars and shown our product. But it seems hard to find the right audience for us. 

If anyone has worked in this industry or grown a business from a domestic to international I would love to hear your take and best way to reach the right audience.

1q8la0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HingeStories/comments/1q8la0j/hinge_progress/,Hinge Progress?,"Hi guys, Female 30 here. I just wanted to share my Hinge experience in case you guys are going through a similar process.

I joined Hinge about a year ago after my relationship ended kinda badly. I never thought I'd be  joining the online dating club to be honest. I had zero idea what to expect and how to navigate this new experience. However, I think I'm one to fairly invest once there's some sort of interest.

FYI, I talked to multiple people. These are just the highlights that I actually spent time getting to know these guys.

Period 1: when I first joined, I was like a kid in a candy store hahaha. I saw so many ""good profiles"": good looking men, men with great prompts, men with great bodies, men with great stories, men with absolute great job titles,... and I felt overwhelmed. I also felt the need to polish my profile to be ""good enough"". Talked to some people, got a couple of first dates, just to realize that it was too overwhelming for me, and that I needed to take some time off.

Period 2: After a couple more months, I felt like I wanted to find that person for me again (this was the main drive, I think I felt lonely at the time). Re-installed the app, got coffee date with this guy. First date felt like an absolute interview lol, and I felt mid about it, but I sticked around for 2nd date because he was really nice. I only had good friend vibe with this guy since the beginning, but since he was really nice, felt like golden retriever energy at that time (later on I felt like it was giving performing energy), I told myself I could see what's gonna happen. Many many dates later, I still felt like friends energy, told him ""I like you as a friend, you're very nice to me, which is almost strange because in my past relationship, even though my ex and I cared for each other, I never got this kind of energy, which I guess is not a bad thing, but something I'm not sure how to feel"". I did not know at that time that I wouldnt be able to develop feelings for him later. I thought me liking him as a friend was a good thing because I believed that a great foundation for a great romantic relationship is friendship (which I still believe is true). I found myself constantly asking him (also myself) ""when is a good timeline that one can find out if they want to move up being exclusive?"" I did feel like since we were seeing each other for about 2 months (we did hold hands and kiss but nothing more than that), I should somehow figure out when to be exclusive with him. I was also scared that if I turned down a nice guy, I wouldnt be able to find any nice guys for me. But soon enough, when I started to be honest with myself about how I feel about the guy as a person (not based on his actions to pursue me), thats when it clicked and I decided to meet him in person to tell him that I can't move forward with him. I thought that it was decent to meet someone in person to say that after a fair amount of time spending with each other. I felt scared before I said bye, but I felt very relieved afterwards.

Period 3: Maybe a couple weeks after that, I found myself on Hinge, again... Felt like I was on a hunt/rush to find my person or something. Met this guy, didn't find him attractive, but he wasn't ugly (maybe better word choice...). BUT I was attracted with his job title (man oh man). I do value a smart guy with strong career and a providing mindset (not that I'm a lazy girl... I'm doing great for myself), and in my past experience, I could develop feelings with guys that I admire something about them. First date was good, I was hella late but he was super cool about it, which was a huge plus imo. He was very proactive, constantly pursued me by doing things that I didnt need to ask for. I felt deeply cared for, which was a huge thing for me. And in the first month of seeing him, I thought to myself that I'm gonna have a boyfriend soon. I care a lot about fitness and the outdoors and this guy seemed to show me his effort in that world, which is a big thing for me. But soon after, it turned out to me that wasn't his real person at all. We are completely 2 different people. I'm an active outdoor person, while that guy was more of a shopaholic, and I couldn't care less about shopping. I like to have nice shoes and a piece of nice clothes sometimes, but I can live without it. I found myself having to negotiate to spend time outdoor vs indoor, and I didn't like it. Ended up breaking things off with him. It was hard because I felt confused and scared. The other guy I couldnt develop feelings, but this guy I could. But it was still not it.

Period 4: Maybe a month later, I found myself on Hinge again, trying my luck, hoping that I would be able to find someone after all of my friends told me that they got a boyfriend... This one was so rough for me since somehow I found myself chasing that ""perfect looking profile"". I was constantly swiping, treating everyone like a literal profile, a resume. If a guy just ""like"" me, and no comment on my prompts/photos, it's an instant unmatch. I took myself THAT serious it was unhealthy. I did that for about 1-2 weeks that I realized I got burnt out from this online dating world, and that I should take a break.

Period 5 (current): After 2 months of taking break, I found myself back at this app. Poor me, I have no other ways to find myself a man but being committed here. But this time, I do find myself more genuine about a person's profile. I went through ones that just like and not just one that comment (Oh btw, I found that many guys just copy paste their comments on a photo/prompts lol. I remember seeing exactly the same comments multiple times lol. So yeah, its not that serious) And thank God I did that, because now I'm matched with this very cute guy (that I actually found him attractive), active lifestyle, good banters so far, similar energy with me, and I have been finding myself looking forward to seeing him on our next dates. I dont even have that much interest on the app either.

TL;DR: If I have to put what I've learned about the whole experiences so far, I would say that this whole online dating thing is rough to experience. But I try to remind myself not to take anything personally. It feels scary sometimes, but anytime anything doesn't work out, we'll learn something about ourselves. We just need to make one good, right decision. Take breaks if need to. And don't settle for misalignments even though it might look good on paper. If someone is not for us, then they are not for us.",0,1767994999.0,HingeStories,1,0.5,False

I go about my morning duties and I talk to this guy, he comes in pretty frequently and he always gets a cold brew with cream and a croissant (not warmed).  

We get to talking and I ask him what he does to work, turns out he is one of the founders of one of my favorite music venues in town. He’s the art director. I genuinely felt a little star struck, that venue space has been home to many years of concerts and poetry slams, been a constant through different relationships and just genuinely been a very safe space for me. 

It’s packed full of art and weirdness and texture. It’s basically an office space with finalices spilling over of different folks art installations. There’s arcade machines and a bar and it’s all cramped and visually stimulating and wonderful 

It was incredible to just stumble on to this fact that this guy I see pretty often, it was him and his friends that fostered this inclusive artistic and funky place I love to visit. I have a lot of respect for him and what this space adds to my city.

And he’s the most unassuming guy, I don’t know that he ever wouldn’t volunteered that information unless I’d asked. He is a nice guy, friendly just a little subdued. I am glad I asked and connected with others today :) ",64,1767994893.0,BenignExistence,7,1.0,False

Think unified tasks + goals + calendar + a few smart features that help you actually get shit done (without the overwhelm ). I built this because most productivity apps either feel too simple or require a PhD to use. FloHub sits right in that sweet spot.

Why you might care:
• Clear view of your day without crap UI
• Features that force action and momentum
• Built with feedback from real users (thanks beta squad!)
• Android-first with tight Play Store integration

What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

Got bought a cheap (stainless nerthus) 4 cup moka pot for Christmas and everything that's come out of it has been pretty bitter. 

I've tried different beans, which did make a minor difference to the flavour, but was still very bitter.

Messing with grind size - 55 - 80 on a Kingrinder k6 didn't seem to make an appreciable difference.

I'm filling the water to just below the valve and using a WDT tool/tapping the funnel to level the grounds.

I've been using hot water maybe 3-5 mins off the boil on a medium/low flame and cooling under the tap as soon as it starts sputtering. I haven't tried starting with cold water yet, so maybe that's next on the list.

I don't know if it's my palate, something I'm doing wrong or the pot itself that's the problem.

1q8kyn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1q8kyn8/i_replaced_social_media_addiction_with/,I replaced social media addiction with 'micro-learning' for 30 days - Here's how it transformed my productivity,"Hey I wanted to share an experiment I tried recently that honestly changed my relationship with time-wasting and learning.

Like many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.

So I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning session. Here's what I did:

**My Setup:**

* Deleted social apps from my phone
* Downloaded an app called Focusly: social media filter to remove Reels, Stories, Shorts from my feed
* Downloaded also: Duolingo, Brilliant, and a Kindle app
* Bookmarked some educational Yt channels
* Installed Pocket for saving interesting articles

**What I learned in 30 days:**

* Basic conversational Spanish (15-20 phrases I can actually use)
* Finally understood how compound interest actually works
* Basics of stock market and investing
* Read 2 full books in ""bite-sized"" chunks
* Learned to solve a Rubik's cube (via yt tutorials)

**The Unexpected Benefits:**

1. Better sleep - no more late-night scrolling
2. Reduced anxiety - less FOMO, more actual accomplishment
3. Better conversations - I actually had interesting things to share
4. Increased focus - my attention span noticeably improved

**The Challenges:**

* First week was HARD. My thumb literally twitched for Instagram
* Had to fight the urge to turn learning into another mindless activity
* Sometimes felt disconnected from friends' daily updates
* Needed to actively plan what I wanted to learn

**Tips if you want to try:**

* Start with topics you're genuinely curious about
* Keep learning sessions under 10 minutes
* Have multiple options ready (different apps/materials)
* Don't beat yourself up if you slip up

The biggest surprise? After 30 days, I didn't even want to go back to my old social media habits. I still use them, but wtih focusly having noe Reels, Shorts, or Stories, makes it wayy less addictive so now it's intentional and limited.

**TLDR:** Replaced mindless scrolling with mini-learning sessions. Learned actual skills, felt more productive, and broke my social media addiction.

Has anyone else tried something similar?",1,1767994264.0,Habits,1,0.67,False
1q8kyc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1q8kyc3/weight_loss_injections_and_sleep_why_your_nights/,Weight Loss Injections and Sleep: Why Your Nights Can Feel Off and How Keltoi Helps Get Them Back on Track,"Sleep is one of the first things people Google once they start weight loss injections, usually after a few restless nights and a bit of head-scratching. You expect appetite changes. You might expect nausea. You don’t always expect to be lying awake at 3am wondering why your brain’s doing laps.

At Keltoi, sleep comes up a lot. Not because weight loss injections are “bad for sleep”, but because they change a few systems in the body that are tightly linked to how and when we rest.

The first thing to say clearly: weight loss injections don’t usually cause classic insomnia. What they tend to do is disrupt routines your body was used to. Hunger cues change, digestion timing changes, blood sugar patterns shift, and for some people that temporarily knocks sleep out of rhythm.

One of the biggest drivers is eating less in the evening without realising it. Appetite suppression often means people skip dinner or eat very lightly, especially early on. That can lead to nighttime blood sugar dips, which the body responds to by releasing stress hormones. Result: wide awake, slightly anxious, and annoyed at the ceiling.

This is something Keltoi flags early, because it’s very fixable. Sleep hates extremes. Too much food late at night can disturb it, but so can too little.

Another factor is digestion. These medications slow gastric emptying. If someone eats a heavier meal late in the evening, they might feel uncomfortable, bloated, or restless in bed. At Keltoi, timing meals earlier in the evening often improves sleep without changing what’s eaten.

Hormones also play a role. Weight loss injections influence GLP-1 pathways, which interact with insulin and cortisol. If stress levels are already high, poor sleep can show up as part of the adjustment phase. This is especially common in people who are already light sleepers or dealing with perimenopause or menopause.

Caffeine sneaks in too. People eating less sometimes rely more on coffee without noticing. Appetite down, caffeine up. Sleep suffers. Keltoi conversations around sleep nearly always include a gentle caffeine reality check.

The encouraging part is that for most people, sleep disruption is temporary. As routines settle and intake becomes more consistent, sleep often improves. In fact, many Keltoi patients report better sleep long term, especially once weight comes down and blood sugar control stabilises.

Better sleep later on is often linked to:

* reduced night-time reflux
* fewer blood sugar swings
* less snoring or sleep apnoea symptoms
* improved overall energy balance

That said, sleep doesn’t usually fix itself by accident. It improves when it’s looked at properly.

What tends to help, and what Keltoi actively encourages:

* not skipping evening meals entirely
* keeping dinner lighter and earlier rather than late and heavy
* staying well hydrated through the day
* watching caffeine creep
* not rushing dose increases if sleep is off

What tends to make things worse:

* undereating to the point of stress response
* heavy meals right before bed
* ignoring sleep issues and hoping they’ll magically pass
* assuming poor sleep means the treatment isn’t suitable

One thing Keltoi is big on is feedback. If sleep changes, it’s information, not a failure. Sometimes it’s a dose issue. Sometimes it’s timing. Sometimes it’s stress or hormones showing up once food noise quiets down.

And importantly, poor sleep makes weight loss harder. Cortisol rises, hunger hormones misbehave, motivation drops. Addressing sleep early isn’t optional, it’s part of good weight loss care.

If you’re on weight loss injections and your sleep feels off, you’re not broken and you’re not imagining it. It’s common, it’s manageable, and it’s usually temporary with the right tweaks.

If anyone here has noticed changes in sleep, good or bad, since starting injections, it’d be helpful to hear what you found made the difference. Those real-world insights are gold for people reading this at silly o’clock wondering if it’s just them.",1,1767994245.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

We’re both in therapy and working on our individual issues though! This was my first time in a healthy relationship with someone who genuinely liked me, and it was weirdly hard to navigate 🥲

My ex and I met on Bumble over summer, she broke up with me in November because of her depression and overwhelm (more context on my profile, we’re both women in our mid/late 20s doing postgrad degrees and also both very fearful avoidant when it comes to relationships 🙈).

I texted her last week asking if we could go for coffee or generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to talk and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country in a couple of weeks.

The purpose of this (for me) is to open up about my avoidant behaviour during the relationship (it’s not like I’d shut her down, I just never opened up in return) and to see if we can move forward together with the added context of neither of us being ready for the intensity we had. 

I don’t know if I’ve done this right? And I don’t know how to read if she’s seeing this as closure or not, she was kind and said she hoped I’d had a nice Christmas but no questions or anything (in fairness, I also didn’t ask any questions beyond asking to have a quick chat and she hates texting at the best of times). I’m really panicking, I didn’t expect her to say yes and I’m so insanely stressed  about actually having to be vulnerable even though this is what I wanted 🙈

Then i started thinking about him more and wondered if i could manifest seeing him around and about. So i just told myself i would see him.

Please also don't message unless you meet my criteria. I appreciate kind works and good lucks but it becomes frustrating after a while.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this, more inclined to go higher than lower)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1767993862.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1q8kqwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q8kqwt/how_to_instantly_look_more_competent_by_showing/,How to Instantly Look MORE Competent by Showing Your Flaws (The PRATFALL Effect Explained),"okay so i spent way too much time reading research papers and psychology books trying to figure out why some people just command respect effortlessly while others try so hard and fall flat. turns out there's this wild psychological phenomenon called the pratfall effect that basically flips everything we think we know about authority on its head.

most people think you need to be perfect to be respected. hide mistakes. never show weakness. project this flawless image. but the research shows the exact opposite. people actually trust and respect you MORE when you reveal carefully chosen flaws. mind blowing right?

i first came across this in elliot aronson's study from 1966 (yeah it's old but the findings are insanely relevant). he had subjects listen to recordings of quiz contestants. the high performing contestant who spilled coffee on himself was rated MORE likeable than the same contestant who didn't spill anything. but here's the kicker, when a low performing contestant spilled coffee, his ratings dropped even further. so the effect only works when you're already demonstrating competence.

the psychology behind it is actually pretty straightforward. perfect people are intimidating and hard to relate to. when someone competent shows a humanizing flaw, it breaks down that barrier and makes them approachable without undermining their expertise. you're still the expert, you're just not a robot about it.

**here's how to actually use this:**

**establish competence FIRST before revealing any vulnerabilities.** this is non negotiable. you can't lead with your flaws and expect people to follow you. demonstrate your knowledge, show your track record, prove you know what you're talking about. once that foundation is solid, then you can afford to be human. i see so many people jump straight to the self deprecating humor without ever establishing why anyone should listen to them. that's just shooting yourself in the foot.

**strategic vulnerability beats random oversharing every time.** this isn't about trauma dumping or complaining about how hard your life is. pick flaws that are either irrelevant to your core competence or that you've already overcome. a finance expert can joke about being terrible at cooking. a public speaker can mention they used to have crippling stage fright (past tense). the vulnerability needs to humanize you without making people question your ability.

adam grant talks about this brilliantly in his podcast worklife. he interviewed leaders who shared mistakes they made early in their careers but framed them as learning experiences. not current incompetence, but past struggles that led to present mastery. that's the sweet spot.

**timing matters more than you think.** don't open with your flaws. don't close with them either. the research suggests the middle of an interaction is optimal. you've already demonstrated value, but there's still time for the increased likability to pay dividends. in a presentation, this might be 15 minutes in. in a job interview, maybe the second or third question. in writing, definitely not the introduction.

**the flaw should be relatable and minor.** spilling coffee works. being chronically late doesn't. forgetting someone's name occasionally is fine. forgetting basic professional responsibilities isn't. the goal is ""oh they're human like me"" not ""oh they're a mess i can't trust them."" 

i've been using this in my own life and the difference is honestly shocking. started admitting when i don't know something instead of bluffing my way through. ""great question, i'm not sure but let me find out"" gets way better responses than trying to fake expertise. people respect the honesty.

brené brown's book daring greatly is genuinely one of the best deep dives into vulnerability as strength. she's a research professor who spent decades studying shame and courage. the book completely dismantles the myth that vulnerability equals weakness. her ted talk has like 60 million views for a reason. she explains how leaders who admit uncertainty and mistakes create cultures of trust and innovation. it's backed by tons of organizational psychology research.

there's also this personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from high quality sources like research papers, expert talks, and books to create custom audio podcasts on topics you want to master. built by a team from columbia university, it generates learning plans tailored to your specific goals and challenges. you can adjust the depth from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with examples, and pick voices that match your mood, everything from calm and soothing to more energetic styles. useful for fitting learning into commutes or workouts without the usual doomscrolling.

robert cialdini covers this in pre suasion too (he's literally THE authority on influence and persuasion). he talks about how strategic self disclosure creates reciprocal trust. when you reveal something personal, others feel psychologically compelled to lower their guard and trust you more. it's one of the most powerful influence techniques that feels completely natural when done right.

the neuroscience backs this up btw. when we perceive someone as ""perfect"" our brains actually create distance. we categorize them as other. but when they show relatable human qualities, mirror neurons fire and we unconsciously see ourselves in them. that neurological connection is what transforms respect into genuine authority.

don't confuse this with false modesty though. people can smell that from a mile away. ""oh i'm terrible at this"" when you're clearly skilled just comes off as fishing for compliments. authentic admission of actual minor flaws hits completely different than performative humility.

the pratfall effect also explains why some of the most magnetic people you know probably have this slightly messy quality about them. they're brilliant at what they do but they'll also tell you about the ridiculous mistake they made last week. that combination is irresistible because it gives permission for others to be imperfect too.

social media has made this even more relevant. everyone's curating these highlight reels of their lives and it's exhausting. the accounts that show behind the scenes struggles while still delivering value? those are the ones people actually connect with. not the carefully filtered perfection.

try this experiment. next time you're in a position where you want to build credibility, establish your competence clearly, then share one small humanizing detail or minor past mistake. watch how the energy in the room shifts. people lean in instead of keeping that professional distance.

the pratfall effect is basically permission to stop pretending you're perfect while still being taken seriously. that's powerful. you get authority without the exhausting performance of flawlessness. and honestly, that's way more sustainable long term than trying to maintain some impossible standard.",2,1767993758.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

When I woke up, I walked outside to get some coffee from a cafe across the street, and I witnessed a hawk fly very low and into a tree near my house. We made eye contact and I just watched for a few seconds and then walked off. When I came back the hawk was gone but it had killed a squirrel which fell out of the tree and was lying in my walkway. 

For context, I live in New Orleans. I am not spiritual but I've always wondered if it was a message or had some deeper meaning and I'd like to hear some opinions from witchy/spiritual/religious folk.

I ordered a cold coffee on zomato at 11:30pm 

The delivery man called my husband (home address has his details) to ask for exact location. 

5 min later he called again to say that he is outside my place, but this time I picked up the call (husband was in another room) and told him to give it to the guard outside. 

He obliged but then asked for something which I couldn’t hear because the audio was cracking. He repeated it but still was not able to hear. I cut the call and he called again. I was very confused as why is he calling again even after delivery, because this almost never happens… 

I pick up the call and he tells me that he wants me to tip him 5/- since he wants to drink chai and he has absolutely no online money. He said he will do 5+5 and have chai. 

He said this again before I could respond, and not a requesting way but ‘as a matter of factly … it felt as if he regularly does this. 

I’m confused if he genuinely required it or was he trying to scam me or just collecting good points from zomato after receiving a tip although minimal. 

How can he have zero balance? Not even 5/- ?? 
Is zomato treating them so badly? 

I don’t mind tipping him even if it is 100/- and he is in genuine need. 

But something felt off in the manner he asked me to tip him.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



My name is Evan Langermann. I went looking for answers, and the asylum found me instead. This is what I saw and what I couldn’t escape.

 

I never wanted to be part of this. I was just an IT Specialist. And a friend. Someone who once believed that curiosity was harmless truth, no matter how dark, was worth chasing. I used to think monsters were people with guns and power. Then I met Waylon Park.

 

I met Waylon years before he became “the whistleblower.” Back when he was just a software engineer quiet, anxious, brilliant. The kind of man who apologized for breathing too loud. I used to tease him for saying sorry even when someone else bumped into him. He laughed, but his eyes never really did. We became best friends in a short period of time.

 

He once told me Murkoff was “just another greedy tech company.” That was before the nightmares started. Before he stopped sleeping. Before his hands began to tremble so violently, he could barely hold a coffee cup without spilling it. The last time I saw him, he looked like a ghost pretending to be alive.

 

We sat across from each other in a small diner off Route 36. It was raining hard, thunder drowning the silence between us. He told me there were things inside Mount Massive no one was meant to see. Words like “neuromodulation,” “mind control,” and “therapeutic obedience.” He tried to laugh them off, but his voice cracked halfway through the sentence. His eyes darted to the window every few seconds, as if expecting someone - or something, to be watching.

 

Two weeks later, he sent that email. The one to Miles Upshur. The one that was never meant to leave Murkoff’s servers. The one they would later call an act of cyberterrorism. He told me about it just hours before. Waylon’s voice was low, almost shaking. “I can’t attach my name to this,” he said. “They’d come for me immediately. But someone has to know… someone has to see the truth, an outsider. I’m sending it anonymously, to a journalist I hope will get it out there. I have to do this, because the things happening here are inhuman, and I don’t want to be part of these experiments.”

 

He paused, swallowing hard. “I’m terrified, Evan. I’ve seen what they do to people in there. I can’t stop it. But maybe if someone from the outside sees it, if it reaches the right eyes, it can matter. Even if just a little.” There was no humor, no pretense. Just the weight of what he’d witnessed, and the quiet desperation of a man trying to fight an impossible machine.

 

Then Miles went in. Waylon escaped and posted his recording. And then, Waylon vanished.

 

The world didn’t care. The story hit the net for a day: Leaked asylum footage: real or fake? but the video was gone before midnight. Copyright claim: Murkoff Corporation. Every copy, every backup, every trace… deleted. The few who saw it described blood, screaming, silhouettes dragging something down a hallway. Some swore they heard prayers between the screams.

 

Then nothing. No more news. No police follow up. No accountability. Two men screamed into the void, and the void swallowed them whole.

 

Everyone moved on. Except me.

 

Because Waylon trusted me. Because someone had to dig where no one else would. Because if I didn’t, they both died for nothing.

 

So now, here I am. My recorder’s blinking red. The GPS says I’m twelve miles from the gate. The air smells like snow and metal. The mountains ahead are black silhouettes, cutting into the storm. Somewhere in there, behind the concrete and the corporate lies the truth.

 

I’m going to Colorado. To Mount Massive Asylum. To the place that eats whistleblowers alive and buries proof under concrete and prayer. And I’m not coming back. Not without finding my best friend Waylon, if I’m lucky enough maybe I will save Miles too.

 

The road up to Mount Massive was a ribbon of cracked asphalt cutting through dense, gray forest. Snow had started to fall lightly, frosting the twisted, skeletal trees, and the wind moaned through the branches like a chorus of whispers. My truck’s tires crunched over broken ice and gravel as I climbed the hill, each turn revealing more of the asylum looming above me.

 

The building was massive, a sprawling monstrosity of brick and steel, with jagged spires reaching towards the sky. Its windows were darkened with grime, some shattered entirely, and from the higher floors, a faint orange glow flickered intermittently, probably some abandoned emergency lights still powered, though it gave the place a false sense of life. Rusted fences lined the perimeter, some bent and broken, others topped with barbed wire that caught the snow and glinted like broken teeth.

 

I parked at the edge of the overgrown driveway, engine idling, my hands gripping the wheel a little too tightly. The air was sharp, cold, and heavy, carrying a scent of decay that I couldn’t place at first like damp earth mixed with rotting wood and something… coppery.

 

As I stepped out, the wind tore at my coat, and for a moment, the forest was silent. Then, faint at first, came a sound that froze me in place. A scream. Piercing, ragged, human, somewhere deep within the asylum’s walls. Another followed it, overlapping, then a low, moaning hum that wasn’t quite a voice but not entirely mechanical either. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to move forward. I had to see. I had to know.

 

The gates were tall, wrought iron, twisted in places like the hands of someone clawing their way out. Snow had gathered along the hinges, and one side sagged enough that I could slip through. I paused, hand on the cold metal, looking up at the sprawling structure. It wasn’t just a building, it was a city of torment. Every wing, every tower, every shattered window promised stories that shouldn’t exist. And yet, I could hear them, the cries of whatever had been left here, or whatever had been created here, echoing through the halls like a dark symphony.

 

I took a deep breath and stepped inside. The snow gave way to cracked concrete, littered with leaves and debris, and the walls of the outer courtyard were pocked with bullet holes, claw marks, and graffiti scrawled in a frantic, jerking hand: “Don’t trust the silence. That’s when it moves.” The rest of the walls were just as bad.

 

Then another scream ripped through the air, muffled and warped and I knew I couldn’t turn back. Mount Massive Asylum had been waiting for me, silent but alive, hungry.

 

I moved closer to the main entrance, the double doors towering and rusted, a single glass pane cracked with what looked like teeth marks. From somewhere deep inside, there was a scraping sound metal on metal, slow and deliberate, followed by the low echo of laughter. It didn’t sound sane.

 

And yet… I could hear it clearly. It wanted me to hear it.

 

I pushed the heavy double doors open, the hinges protesting with a sharp screech that echoed into the empty courtyard behind me. Inside, the air was still, almost suffocating, the silence pressing against my ears. I fumbled for my camcorder, clicked it on, and felt a cold comfort in the soft red recording light. Every step from here on out had to be documented every clue, every sign, every trace of what had happened here. If I was going to find Waylon, I couldn’t risk forgetting a single detail.

 

The administration block stretched ahead, long hallways lined with metal framed doors, many splintered or hanging crooked on their hinges. The ceiling tiles had fallen in places, exposing the insulation and pipes above, and water had pooled on the cracked linoleum floor. Washed out signs hung crookedly: Admissions, Patient Records, Staff Only. The faint smell of rust, blood, and mildew hung in the air.

 

I followed a dark streak on the floor, dark enough to be blood leading past the reception desk, where papers had been scattered, some soaked through, ink running like it had been abandoned in a hurry. Filing cabinets were toppled over, drawers ripped out, their contents spilling onto the ground.

 

I reached what remained of the elevator, its doors hanging open like a gaping mouth. The cables were frayed, twisted metal gleaming under the flickering fluorescent lights. A note tacked to the wall with a thumbtack read: “Do not use. Out of order.” I guessed no one had followed that warning.

 

I moved carefully, recording everything, eyes darting to each door. Some were locked, others opened into empty offices, with chairs overturned and computers smashed, screens still flickering faintly as if remembering the lives that once occupied them. My gaze lingered on a map tacked to the wall, faded and torn. It showed the layout of the asylum, every wing labeled in neat handwriting long worn by time and neglect.

 

I started checking the office drawers and filing cabinets for any clue about Waylon. Patient files, memos, employee logs, I didn’t care what I found first, as long as it pointed me in the right direction. My hand brushed a folder stamped PENDING INVESTIGATION, and I pulled it free. Inside, scribbled notes mentioned “Staff disappearance,” “Experiment logs,” and most importantly, a reference to a basement wing marked RESTRICTED ACCESS.

 

Waylon had to be there. That much was clear.

 

I pressed forward, letting the camcorder record every hallway, every shadow, every peeling wall. The administration block was just the beginning, but the signs of what had happened here were already impossible to ignore, blood trails smeared along the walls, torn upholstery, and the occasional overturned wheelchair silently screaming of the horrors that had passed through.

 

The stairs leading down to the basement were buried beneath a heap of collapsed concrete and twisted rebar. I kicked at the rubble, the sound echoing through the empty hall like a gunshot. There was no way through. Whatever had happened down there, Murkoff had sealed it for a reason. I checked the map again under the faint glow of the camcorder screen. Another route stretched deeper into the asylum, past the administration block, through a section marked Male ward A block. The handwriting beneath it read, “Access to lower levels via maintenance hall.” I didn’t have a choice.

 

The hallway ahead was swallowed in darkness. I clicked on the camcorder’s night vision, the green tinted lens cutting through the pitch black, revealing peeling walls, broken tiles, and shadows that seemed to crawl. Every step echoed unnaturally. Then, somewhere further down the corridor, I heard footsteps, sounds, slow but deliberate. And a voice twisted, strangled, screaming: “No… don’t touch me! I won’t be your work, I won’t…!”

I froze, the sound of it crawling under my skin. Something was being dragged across the floor. My stomach turned as I crept toward the first cracked door on my right, pressing myself against the frame. Through the camcorder, I saw him. A man tall, gaunt, hair matted with blood, it was dragging another human along the floor. The victim’s arms flailed, their screams jagged and raw, the sound almost too much to bear: “I won’t be… your creation!”

The taller man hummed as he worked, head tilting like he was admiring something only he could see. In one hand, a chisel. In the other, a rusted saw.

 

“I make them beautiful,” he muttered. “You’ll see. You’ll all see.”

 

Then he brought the chisel down. Once. Twice. The sound was thick, like meat being punched. He tore his head open, the victim was screaming so loud, kicking and trying to protest, but the taller man was much stronger he talked again as he put the chisel in his open head now.

 

“Shhh, It will pass soon, so soon, you will be beautiful, my perfect art.”

 

I swallowed bile, forcing myself not to breathe too loud. The camcorder caught every second.

 

When he finally disappeared down the corridor, dragging his new creation with him, I dared to move. The room I’d hidden in smelled like copper and rot It was small, maybe an old storage closet repurposed into some kind of shrine. My light fell on the walls covered in words scrawled in blood and ash. “Salvation through suffering” and “Feed the body, cleanse the soul”. Human limbs, fingers and pieces of torsos, were stacked in corners, a grotesque library of pain.

 

I spotted a stack of files on a metal shelf. One was marked: PARK, WAYLON – SUBJECT FILE. My hands shook as I opened it. Waylon’s name was under the BASEMENT – RESTRICTED section. Relief mixed with dread, at least I was right about the basement, but the path would be far from easy. The next that I read made my blood freeze, I’ve read about experiments on humans.

 

Patient 104: “Electroshock therapy. Severe reaction. Vocalizations extreme. Autonomy compromised. Recommended indefinite isolation.”

 

Patient 112: “Neuromodulation experiment: auditory hallucinations induced to enhance obedience. Screaming recorded for twelve continuous hours.”

 

Patient 137: “Dissection of tissue without anesthesia. Subject exhibits no pain response. Behavior increasingly erratic, violent outbursts noted.”

 

But what most caught my attention was a file about some male twins with last names Duponds: patients 117-A and 117-B. Born conjoined at the pelvis. Murkoff kept them alive past human limits. “Subjects displays extreme aggression when food or attention is withheld, otherwise they can be so calm, but dangerous. Cannibalistic and psychopathic behavior. Recommended isolation protocol: maximum restraint.”

 

I had to keep moving. I had to find Waylon. But for the first time, the thought that I might not survive this place wasn’t just fear it was certainty.

 

I stepped out of the room, the stench of blood and decay clinging to my clothes, and continued down the dark hallway, the camcorder light cutting through the shadows. At the end of the corridor, a figure caught my eye. A man, or what used to be a man, was pressing his skull against the wall, slamming it repeatedly, mumbling and chanting over and over: “Father Martin burned… no Salvation… Father Martin, Father Martin… our only hope is Father Sullivan Knoth… Knoth… Knoth…” He was repeating their names like prayer.

 

His words twisted my stomach. He rocked back and forth, arms trembling, whispering, then screaming and getting more aggressively, “The sculptor dragged a man past me… he will make an art… I’m next… Father Martin can’t protect me… I need Papa Knoth!”

 

I froze, heart hammering, careful not to make a sound. He didn’t notice me. Slowly, I edged past him, keeping my camcorder aimed but shaking with every step.

 

The hallway opened into a prison like chamber, iron bars stretching in every direction. variants lay in some cells, but others pounded at their cages, snarling and twisting with desperation. I pressed my body close to the walls, moving quietly and dodging their grasping hands.

 

In the center of the room lay a heap of naked, lifeless bodies. Skin pale and waxy, eyes blank, limbs twisted. The stench of rot and ammonia assaulted me, thick and choking. My stomach lurched. I held the camcorder up, recording every detail, but it was no use, my body betrayed me, and I retched, barely keeping from vomiting onto the floor.

 

I had to get out of this room. Fast. There was no time to linger, no time to mourn the dead. I turned towards a shadowed doorway at the far end, my only path forward towards the basement, the one place where Waylon might still be alive.

 

The hallway beyond was darker than any I had passed. Silence pressed in on me, heavier than the screams from before. Every step felt like walking into a maw, and I knew whatever awaited me down there was far worse than what I’d just seen.

 

It was darker than anything I had passed before, and a rusted, peeling sign read: Male Ward C Block. My mind snapped back to what I had seen on the map before, I needed to reach Male Ward A Block to get down to the basement. But there were no signs of A Block anywhere. I had no choice. I had to search C Block first and hope it led me closer.

 

C Block was a labyrinth of decay and despair. Rooms lined the hallway, some were patient rooms with broken beds and blood smeared walls, others were offices, staff rooms, and doctor offices. Prayers and warnings were scratched into every surface. Many doors were locked, useless, but I kept moving, careful not to make a sound. The air smelled of old blood, antiseptic, and something metallic I couldn’t place.

 

Then I found a door slightly ajar, Dr. Richard Trrager’s office. I pushed it open, camcorder already running. Inside, chaos and horror awaited. Maps and blueprints of the asylum were scattered across the desk, marked with red ink, showing corridors, secret passages, and stairwells. On the desk were files, some soaked in dark, sticky blood. Shelves lined with jars glinted under the camcorder’s light, yellowish liquid, organs floating inside, some unrecognizable, some grotesquely familiar.

 

I crouched and flipped through one of the files. Patient: Vincent Arlow. Formerly an artist. Schizophrenic. Hallucinations so vivid he believed every human body was a canva, every limb a tool to create his “art.” The notes described his extreme aggression, how he would carve, tear, and mold flesh as though it were clay. This was the sculptor. My stomach roiled as I read, but I kept recording, snapping photos with the camcorder, documenting everything.

 

Then a noise. A scrape, a whisper. Then a scream that made my heart lurch: “NOT ME! NOT ME! PLEASE, NOT ME!” It was the same voice from before, the man slamming his head. And I realized with a sickening clarity: the Sculptor had him now.

 

I pressed myself against the wall, holding my breath. Through the cracked door, I could see the Sculptor or Vincent Arlow dragging the variant into the center of the office. The variant looks in the eyes were wide, pleading, his body struggling. Then the Sculptor struck, tearing the variant’s head off in a spray of blood and bone, he threw the head on the wall. I couldn’t hold it back, a gasp escaped my throat.

 

“Who’s there?!” Vincet Arllow shouted, spinning after me, rage burning in his eyes. His footsteps thundered down the hall. “You think you can watch? You will be next! My art, my beautiful art, my art. My next art.” He was running after me.

 

Panic hit. I bolted, sprinting towards a shattered window. I jumped, crashing through the ice cold glass, landing hard on the snow covered ground. It was dark now, but the snow was helping me see through the night. Pain shot through my arm where I’d cut myself on the shards, blood mixing with the snow, but I was alive.

1. I created a set of images with a max long edge of 1024 of about 18 images

2. The Images were NOT captioned, only a trigger word was given. I've seen mixed commentary regarding best practices for this. Feedback on this would be appreciated, as I do have all the images captioned

3. Using a lora rank of 32, with float8 transformer and float8 text encoder. cached text embeddings No other parameters were touched (timestep weighted, bias balanced, learning rate 0,0001, steps 3000)

5. Which is better for comfy? BF16 or FP16?

  
I tweaked the sample prompts to use the trigger word



What's happening is as the samples are being cranked out, the prompt adherence seems to be absolutely terrible. At around 1500 steps I am seeing great resemblance, but the images seem to be overtrained in some way with the environment and outfits. 

  
for example I have a prompt of xsonamx holding a coffee cup, in a beanie, sitting at a cafe and the image is her posing on some kind of railing with a streak of red in her hair 

  
or 

xsonamx, in a post apocalyptic world, with a shotgun, in a leather jacket, in a desert, with a motorcycle

shows her standing in a field of grass posing with her arms on her hips wearing what appears to be an ethnic clothing design.

xsonamx holding a sign that says, 'this is a sign' has no appearance of a sign. Instead it looks like she's posing in a photo studio (of which the sample sets has a couple).

  
Is this expected behavoiur? will this get better as the training moves along?

  
I also want to add that the samples seem to be quite grainy. This is not a dealbreaker, but I have seen that generally z-image generated images should be quite sharp and crisp.

It's constant, it's every day, and even when absolutely nothing is going on and I'm trying to have fun, something creeps up.

Especially my morning anxiety is the worst. Not to the point of wanting to off myself but it's very cold and dark. It gets better after I get up and start moving around but it will come up at some point during the day again, and I feel like it slows down my thinking and I often feel foggy. Like I bring someone a cup of coffee and say ""here is your glass"", they will correct me but then a few minutes later I will make the same mistake again. It wasn't like that before, it's like my anxious thoughts are consuming my brain capacity. It's always been there to an extent but the past 6-7 months are worse with no end to it. I'm not medicated and don't visit anyone. Also, last year was pretty rough and hectic - my father died, another close relative nearly died, I changed jobs, now moving to another city.

* Something like ""I'm talking 2 shots 4 shots, five, I drink my coffee like it's '95""

* Indie/independent artist - definitely not mainstream
* Fun, quirky vibe, it was basically an ode to loving coffee
* I *think* it might have been called ""Nectar of Life"" but I'm not 100% sure
* Rap-like flow but could have been more spoken word or comedy hip-hop

* Possibly Grooveshark (RIP), which would explain why it's so hard to find now since all that music was lost when they shut down in 2015
* Could have also been MySpace, early SoundCloud, or PureVolume but I'm almost certain it was Grooveshark

1q8k6rp,https://i.redd.it/vtiut99d1ecg1.jpeg,Small But Mighty: Ideas for Renting an Empty Lot,"Petite Yet Powerful: Suggestions for Leasing an Vacant Parcel\
Introduction\
Vacant lots are frequently disregarded pieces of land that possess tremendous potential for a variety of uses. Whether you are seeking to lease an vacant lot for a brief event or a lengthy business endeavor, there are countless possibilities for transforming these areas into valuable assets. In this article, we will examine a assortment of suggestions for leasing an vacant lot and optimizing its potential.\
1. Fleeting Events\
One of the most popular uses for vacant lots is as a venue for fleeting events. These could encompass food truck festivals, open-air markets, art displays, and live music performances. By leasing out an vacant lot for a brief period, event organizers can craft a distinctive and captivating experience for the community while generating income for the lot owner. With the correct marketing and promotion, fleeting events can draw large groups and create a buzz that will benefit the surrounding area.\
2. Parking\
Another practical use for an vacant lot is as a parking area. In urban areas where parking is limited and in high demand, leasing out an vacant lot for parking can be a profitable venture. Whether it is for daily parking, event parking, or long-term agreements, providing a secure and convenient parking option can entice customers and generate a steady income for the lot owner.\
3. Urban Farming\
Vacant lots can be converted into urban farms to cultivate fruits, vegetables, and flowers. This sustainable and eco-friendly use of an vacant lot can provide fresh produce for the community, promote local food production, and create a beautiful green area in otherwise neglected urban environments. Urban farming can also be utilized as an educational tool for schools and community groups to learn about agriculture and environmental stewardship.\
4. Open-air Recreation\
Vacant lots can be used for open-air recreation activities such as yoga classes, fitness boot camps, and fitness events. The open space and fresh air perfectly suit physical activities, and leasing out the lot for these purposes can create a vibrant and healthy community focal point. Furthermore, open-air recreation events can attract a broad spectrum of participants and promote health and wellness in the community.\
5. Temporary Retail\
Retail businesses looking to extend or experiment with new concepts could benefit from leasing an vacant lot as a temporary retail space. Whether it is to establish a temporary clothing store, a seasonal pop-up shop, or a mobile coffee stand, an vacant lot can provide a versatile and affordable location for retail businesses to reach new customers and test out new ideas. Additionally, the unique and temporary nature of the retail space can create a sense of excitement and curiosity among potential customers.\
6. Community Gardens\
Vacant lots can also be transformed into community gardens, providing a space for residents to grow their own fruits, vegetables, and flowers. Community gardens can be a potent tool for building community spirit, promoting healthy eating, and providing a source of fresh and affordable produce for local residents. Leasing out an vacant lot for a community garden project can also be a valuable way for lot owners to contribute to the well-being of the community.\
7. Event Space\
Vacant lots can be leased out as event spaces for a wide range of gatherings such as weddings, corporate events, and family celebrations. With the correct infrastructure and amenities, such as tents, seating, and lighting, an vacant lot can be converted into a stunning and versatile event venue. Lot owners can collaborate with event organizers to provide customizable spaces and services to accommodate their specific needs, providing a valuable and memorable experience for their clients.\
8. Art and Cultural Events\
Vacant lots can be utilized as venues for art installations, open-air galleries, and cultural events. Artists and creators can lease out the lot to showcase their work, host workshops, or organize cultural celebrations. Such events can bring people together from diverse backgrounds and inspire creativity and dialogue within the community. Additionally, art and cultural events in vacant lots can contribute to the revitalization and beautification of urban spaces.\
9. Temporary Housing\
In areas with housing shortages or displaced populations, vacant lots can be used to provide temporary housing solutions. Whether it is for emergency shelter, transitional housing, or affordable housing projects, leasing out an vacant lot for this purpose can provide a safe and dignified living space for those in need. Lot owners and housing organizations can collaborate to create well-designed and sustainable housing solutions that benefit both the residents and the surrounding community.\
Conclusion\
Vacant lots hold immense potential for a wide range of uses and can be transformed into valuable assets with the right ideas and planning. Whether it is for temporary events, urban farming, retail spaces, or housing solutions, leasing out an vacant lot can create unique and impactful experiences for the community while generating income for the lot owner. By exploring the ideas mentioned in this article and thinking creatively about how to utilize vacant lots, we can unlock the hidden potential of these spaces and contribute to the vitality and well-being of our communities.\

1q8k6lu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8k6lu,"If there was a Hellaverse Cookbook, what recipes would best represent Angel Dust?","Hello again, everyone!


Thank you, once again, for your responses in my previous post. I got some excellent ideas for this ongoing project.


As a reminder, I'm working on a Hellaverse themed cookbook and trying to crowd source ideas from my fellow fans. I'm looking for any and all ideas of what recipes thematically fit each character of the show.


Next, the star of such features as Morning Coffee Gone Sexual, Angel Dust!


Now, as most of the fandom is aware, Angel was from New York, born to Italian immigrants (just conjecture but likely from Sicily). Viv has stated that he's actually quite a skilled cook, one of his specialties being Ravioli and I think this is a good direction.


Just to be extra, perhaps the pasta could be colored pink (by adding beet juice or something similar to the flour) to match his color scheme.


Alternatively we could make Farfalle (Bowtie pasta), but with how many people in the Hellaverse wear bowties that could apply to nearly anyone.

1q8k6de,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbandesign/comments/1q8k6de/thoughts_on_urbanists_and_public_transit/,Thoughts on urbanists and public transit enthusiasts who often portray car-based infrastructure as catastrophic rather than a mild inconvenience?,"In many urbanist and transit-enthusiast spaces, especially online, car-centered infrastructure is framed as actively harmful or even catastrophic. The most extreme version, seen in movements like [r/fuckcars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars), treats cars not as a tradeoff but as a moral failure. While I understand and agree with some critiques, this framing in my view often overstates harms, ignores benefits, and misses how people actually live.

The standard critiques are familiar. Cars contribute to climate change, pollution, and traffic deaths. Car-centric planning encourages sprawl, reduces walkability, and increases isolation. Dense, transit-oriented neighborhoods are framed as healthier, more social, and more sustainable. In theory, this makes sense, and I support better transit, safer streets, and more walkable places.

But my lived experience complicates this picture. I have lived in Manhattan, in dense River North in Chicago, and now in a fully suburban, car-dependent area of Southern California. Subjectively, this has not felt like a major downgrade in quality of life.

Car-based areas are not devoid of social or walkable spaces. Southern California has large malls, beaches, walkable downtowns, coffee shops, hiking trails, and extensive parks. People still socialize, eat, walk, bike, and spend time together. They simply drive to these places first. The social activity exists, but access is different.

Ride sharing also changes the equation. Uber and Lyft are abundant, making it easy to bars or clubs without worrying about drunk driving. This weakens one of the strongest historical arguments against car dependence.

Car infrastructure also enables larger living spaces. Single-family homes, yards, and private outdoor areas are common. My partner’s family has a backyard pool and space for their dog. These amenities were inaccessible to me in Manhattan or urban Chicago without extreme wealth.

Urbanists often argue that walkability and transit reduce atomization by forcing interaction. In practice, my experience in Manhattan was that frequent interaction does not equal friendliness. People were often gruff, small talk was limited, and making friends was difficult. Actually, bars were where socializing felt easiest, which is something available almost everywhere.

There is also an assumption that urban living is inherently healthier because people walk more. But lifestyle and culture matter more than infrastructure alone. Manhattan has heavy drinking and constant eating out well into middle age and beyond. Southern California, despite car dependence, has a strong fitness culture. Gyms, Pilates, SoulCycle, and yoga are common, and many people remain highly active.

This points to a broader issue. Culture often matters more than infrastructure. Tokyo is famously walkable with excellent transit, yet many people are deeply unhappy due to an introverted social culture, extreme work culture, and academic/professional pressure. San Francisco combines walkability, transit, and nature, yet widespread loneliness persists, largely due to introverted, tech-driven culture. Infrastructure alone does not determine social outcomes.

It is also worth noting that cars are not absent from places urbanists idealize. People drive in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul, Manhattan, and Chicago. Cars coexist with transit and walking. The difference is degree, not presence versus absence.

Suburban, car-based environments also suit certain life stages better. Families benefit from space, easier transportation to activities, and fewer noise constraints. Playing loud instruments or caring for elderly relatives is far easier with a car and more space. My own experience playing trumpet in a marching band would have been much harder in a dense city. Cars also enable transporting bulky and large musical instruments or speakers. 

Cars are also a lifeline in cities with extreme weather, such as intense heat or cold. Also, people struggling with homelessness who have cars will tell you 10/10 times they prefer having a car to lacking one.

There is also an emotional and cultural dimension that is often dismissed. Cars provide a sense of freedom, going where you want when you want, which is deeply embedded in American culture. Postwar suburbanization and highways may have gone too far, but they made sense historically. Cars were modern, exciting, and fun, and they still retain real aesthetic and emotional appeal.

I myself grew up in a suburb, and no one viewed learning how to drive as a huge barrier or detriment. It was seen as completely normal, and 99% of people got their driver's license when they were 16. We all viewed it as a normal rite of passage and something really exciting. Once we learned to drive and had access to a car, no one felt car-based infrastructure was limiting.

None of this denies that people with disabilities need support. But many disabled folks also struggle with subway systems - many lack working elevators. In the long run, technologies like self-driving cars may offer better accessibility than forcing every region into a dense, transit-first model.

I also accept the environmental critique of gas-powered cars. Climate change is real, and transportation emissions matter. But the solution is cleaner energy, electric vehicles, safety improvements, and smarter planning, not turning every place into Manhattan. Different environments serve different needs, and a mix of models is healthier than ideological purity.

Overall, I sympathize with many urbanist critiques. I simply reject portraying car-centered infrastructure as catastrophic rather than as a set of tradeoffs shaped by culture, technology, and personal circumstances.",0,1767992461.0,urbandesign,16,0.39,False

Thank you, once again, for your responses in my previous post. I got some excellent ideas for this ongoing project.


As a reminder, I'm working on a Hellaverse themed cookbook and trying to crowd source ideas from my fellow fans. I'm looking for any and all ideas of what recipes thematically fit each character of the show.


Next, the star of such features as Morning Coffee Gone Sexual, Angel Dust!


Now, as most of the fandom is aware, Angel was from New York, born to Italian immigrants (just conjecture but likely from Sicily). Viv has stated that he's actually quite a skilled cook, one of his specialties being Ravioli and I think this is a good direction.


Just to be extra, perhaps the pasta could be colored pink (by adding beet juice or something similar to the flour) to match his color scheme.


Alternatively we could make Farfalle (Bowtie pasta), but with how many people in the Hellaverse wear bowties that could apply to nearly anyone.

“We just met. He wasn’t too far off from the fire, must’ve rolled down a collapsed hill. I was getting ready to leave too.” Guan said, removing the blood-soaked bandages from the man’s leg, and proceeded to do the same for his body. She opened her satchel and took out a fresh roll. It smelled of lavender, lemon, and cinnamon, and she re-wrapped the one side, and got ready for the other half. Sadia, a woman with dark braids hanging from either side of her, widened her eyes when she began to peel off the burnt clothing around the man’s shoulders. The skin coming off with the shirt forced something up from her stomach and she had to fight it.

Guan rolled up her sleeve, took out a syringe and stuck herself, drawing a vial of blood. She injected the vial into the vein at the crease of his arm. Once emptied, she resumed wrapping the arm and noticed Sadia growing uneasier by the second and could only smile.

“Come here, help me get him onto the bed. Can you pull it out for me?” she asked.

Sadia pushed down the sickness and slid over to the opposite wall of the tiny med bay, pushed several keys and a small cot flipped out. It was dusty and too short for him, but it would have to do. Comfort in an evac ship was never a priority. Guan and she were careful as they moved him to it, and his legs were propped up by a crate. Guan folded his arms across his chest and gave him a light kiss on the head.

“Ok, it’s not my place but aren’t you afraid of contracting infection? I know it’s just us but if you catch something.” Sadia said.

“If we had just let him be, then yes, it would set in. But Emalians are resistant either way, at least that’s what I read in the guidebooks.” She replied.

Sadia pulled down a wall chair and sank into it, removing her fur-lined coat, “You can’t believe those things, it makes us out to seem superhuman and novel. They’re not even written by us.” She turned to the status monitor and checked the autopilot; they would make it to Somatica with the fuel available but barely. Guan applied pressure to her stick spot and rested her head on the wall, taking momentary glances at the man lying to her left. “There must be some truth to it, look at you two.”

Sadia didn’t know whether to laugh or take it in earnest, “Well, if you were able to stick around long enough, you’d see it for yourself.”

“I was there for a few months. Mostly by myself, but some locals were kind enough to help me. There was an old man who helped me fix my knife.”

“Romanosuke. He’s a transplant, but he has done a lot for our community as a whole.” Sadia said, “It’s funny how outsiders can be. You never know who you’ll get.”

Guan chuckled, “You’re welcome.” Sadia looked up and smiled back, showing her dimples, but then it receded as fast as it came. “I need a visual check.”

“I think I’ll stay here to watch over our man.”

Sadia proceeded down the small hallway, passed the bridge and climbed the ladder to the cockpit where Jonas sat. He was fast asleep. There she was in her glowing magnificence. The pale glimmer of Lunascence reflected across the viewer with Sol in the distance, peeking out from the top right corner. She swiveled left, and there was Frongaea, a bastion of destruction.

A once beautiful azure planet swollen and dotted with swirling monsoons, and bright orange plumes. Frothing geysers spewed more debris into the void. She wanted to wake Jonas instead of bungling around at the pilot’s console to see if she could zoom in but he looked comfortable. His black curls and his forest green jumpsuit couldn’t hide that poor excuse for a beard. At least he smelled of ocean spray. The patch on his shoulder read Verdant Group in small gold lettering below a symbol of two trees on a blue sphere with three stars arranged like an inverted triangle. Two silver wings flanked the whole ensemble.

They had managed to outrun the collapse and were now gliding across the canvas of Luna. The initial thruster pods were not enough to reach escape velocity just as the tectonic plates split, but the energy from Jonas’s slingshot maneuver had boosted them much farther than anticipated.

But now the momentum was gone and to conserve fuel, it would take an estimate of four months to reach Somatica. She pulled a blanket from the pilot’s compartment and draped it over him who stirred but didn’t wake. She sat on the small shelf to his right, and it creaked under her weight. A cup of coffee was next to her hand, and it had gone cold but still tasted like hazelnut. Her gloves were stained with dirt and bits of charred clothing had fallen into the coffee. There was no evidence the burned man gave her that he was Emalian, since it could’ve been anyone at this point.

She didn’t feel sorry for the ones left behind, as evil as it sounded in her own head, but they were fools to gather around Shanlaba, waiting to return to their so-called “heaven”. It then occurred to her that she might be the last of her people, drifting along to a new world, but there would be possibilities for a fresh start or at least that’s what VG offered. However, something in her wanted to hold out for any form of kinship. A familiar face. Her mind raced to Toq’toa and that very thought caused her to slam the metallic mug into the grated walkway.

“I ordered a blended coffee, where’s my blended coffee?!” Jonas groaned. His headset had come halfway across his face, but he readjusted and turned to Sadia. He rubbed his eyes and looked down at his feet, now wet, “Oh, hey, uh you all right?”

“Hey, sorry.” She knelt and used a nearby rag, her braids a stark contrast against the cream-colored floor and walls, first wiping his feet then the ground.

He couldn’t stop staring at her form as she mopped the floor, broad at the shoulders and wide at the hips. An hourglass figure if he ever saw one, but he slapped himself with both hands to rid his head of further thought and instead trained on the console.  “Don’t worry about it. How’s our guy doing?”

“According to the Shynes nurse, he’ll be stable.”

“What luck, right?”

“What do you mean?”

“The last two Emalians, like some Adam and Eve. Might as well call this the Cargo of Eden.” He studied the flight data and calibrated the autopilot steering, making sure there were no wasted movements. One of the thrusters was operating at half capacity, and he figured he’d get out and fix it once he got his bearings.

“That’s not funny.” Sadia tossed a braid that had draped over her chest and went back down the ladder, but not before taking the coffee with her.

The ship itself reeked, other than burnt flesh, like the stagnant air of a commercial entity. She dragged the rag across the walls and threw it in an unmarked bin, returning to the med bay. Guan was gone.

He was still how they left him, but he was breathing at a snail’s pace. The blood had stopped leaking so much and there were only a few splotches near his chest, and some scattered around his legs. She got closer and studied his frame. He was tall but not skinny, lean with an athletic build, wide at the chest and back. His thighs and calves were bulky.

She sat opposite him, drinking the coffee one sip at a time.

Guan shuffled in, carrying a glass of buffalo milk and said nothing to either of them, rolling out another fresh set of bandages and got to changing the old ones out. Whatever flesh was left didn’t peel off as easily, and his body started jerking in response to her touch.

“Is he going to be able to swallow?” Sadia asked, but it sounded more hostile than inquisitive.

“His neck muscles are too weak. I’ll have to insert a feeding tube.” She opened her satchel and took out a long tube, a syringe and a clear liquid which she sprayed generously on both items before wiping it clean. The tube was rinsed using the residual sanitizer. She reached behind her back and pulled out the knife and cleaned it as well, new with its white lacquered handle and curved at the tip. Her hand held steady, made a small incision at the abdomen and inserted the tube, no longer pinching at the top but she let go as she poured the milk in from an angle, spilling it.

Sadia headed for the kitchen to grab more milk, and when she returned, Guan had her feed the tube. “Sorry, my tendinitis is acting up.” She took out a handkerchief and wiped up the spill.

“This seems easy enough, until it’s all gone right?”

“Mhmm. The nutrition in the buffalo milk is actually perfect so we’re pretty fortunate.”

“Well, if he is what we think he is, then he’ll make it.” Sadia couldn’t steady herself, and it splashed all over her thigh.

“Go sleep, I’ll manage, I think I have some painkillers somewhere.”  

“You should. Look at you.”

Guan gestured for the tube and kept her hand raised.

There were four pull-out cots in the bunk area just past the med bay, situated at the back near the engine room. Sadia made herself as comfortable as she could and used her coat like a blanket.

 

\~\~\~

 

The tiny kitchen was set up like a restaurant with metal plates and utensils arranged in an orderly fashion. Guan was frying up thin slices of bison in an ungainly amount of butter. Jonas sat at one end of the table and proceeded to chug down a glass of buffalo milk.

“I should’ve visited. This stuff is mind-blowing,” He said, putting down the glass and stared at the sizzling pan. “Commissaries could never with their lab-grown shit.”

Guan served him as Sadia walked in.

“I knew I smelled bison. How did you get that?” she asked.

 “My client was a tourist. He could not shut up about Emalia. The guy sold everything and decided to visit before the world went to shit. Said he would return after buying all this stuff, said he forgot a gift for his kid. I waited a whole week for him.”

“His child is on Somatica?” Guan sat down between them.

“He never said but I would hope so. Otherwise, I just spoiled everyone’s dinner.” 

“It’s already spoiled because we’re eating a dead man’s bounty.”

The bison was overcooked and tough, but Sadia wolfed it down. Jonas had taken his plate to the cockpit along with a fresh cup of coffee. Guan dipped a piece of bread in the leftover meat juices, sopping it all up.

“You don’t waste anything,” Sadia said again. “You’d fit right in.”

“My mom,” Guan took both their plates and washed them in the sink. “Don’t get me wrong, we were well off, but she made sure it didn’t go to our heads.”

“Can I ask you something? You don’t have to ans-”

“Yes.”

“Why Emalia?”

“I needed to get away. As far as possible.”

“Wish I had that luxury.”

Sadia poured herself a glass of buffalo milk and took it to the bunk room, and Guan sat at the dinner table, tapping on her glass of water while humming a melody.

 

\~\~\~

Guan took a detour to Jonas’s cockpit. He was getting ready to head outside, standing at the bridge, checking over his suit at the door of the small air lock. A toolbox was at his feet. “All done?”

His voice through the helmet crackled and fizzled, “This ocean spray scent never gets old.” He handed his mug and plate to her, “Thanks. Thruster’s a bit busted so I’m gonna make a quick fix. I won’t take longer than fifteen but I’ll keep comms open so if ya need, just buzz it.”

She checked the burned man one last time before dropping off the dishes to be washed later, shuffling to the bunk room. The single pathway only accommodated one person at a time, but even her slender frame somehow felt wider than normal. Sadia tossed around several times, her brows mashed against her eyelids.

The cot felt like feathers and clouds, but she was way too tired to fall asleep. She touched her cheeks, and it was starting to dry since she hadn’t showered in two days. But at this point, she didn’t want to get up. The locket necklace that hung around her neck drooped over to her left, and she held it in front of her.

Yang’s smile was bright as she remembered, clutching her mother’s and her shoulder with that wingspan of his, the eyebrows rising to the edge of his hairline. Her mother, Hoa, always wore the same expression. Thin lips, a meager grin but her eyes showed everything. A strength and a quiet resilience. Kitty stood just peeking above Yang’s left arm, her top bun perfect and lined with a row of pearls. Her thick-rimmed glasses were too big for her but that’s how she always liked it.

She listened to the clanking reverberating back inside when Jonas passed by the bunk area. His magnetic boots thudded twice as he secured himself to work, and it reminded her of the window cleaners outside Chanhan Hospital. Hundreds of feet in the sky, secured by a metal carriage no longer than a regular bench and no protection from the elements. That was daring to her.

They worked in the presence of vulnerability, and she could only watch from the other side. If she was a field medic in times of war, would she have so much control over things like she did now? It was unfair to think of herself in this way, her certifications proved it, but it was the very reason she had to leave.

\~\~\~

Jonas’s welding torch lit up his face like a solar flare in the darkness, and his heartbeat was rapid from him chugging one and a half cups of coffee in the span of an hour. Still, his hands were steady as he sealed up a crack in the aft rocket engine booster. He checked his EVA suit, and the vitals were still good. The spare oxygen tank would last six hours, and he had stored ten more in the small cargo space near the engine room. He popped open a panel near the booster and found several burned wires but all he had to do was strip the melted casing, snip off the ends, and rewound them.

He flashed a small light on the console circuit.

“Bingo. Found the real issue.”

Half of the capacitors were fried crispy and came off with a flick of his giant gloved finger. A proper evacuation procedure wouldn’t come close to burning one, but a slingshot maneuver wasn’t in the cards for any ordinary evac pilot. Two years of combat flight training, one year in the field during the Plate Wars and now he was ferrying the last of the survivors. It was funny how things translated so fast in such a short time. VG’s wacko president was only a wacko until he was right. Now he was on Somatica laughing his ass off.

The noiseless vacuum served to drive the question home. Who would take command of The Red Devil? It was much bigger with more territory to cover, no real laws or governing body established so it was basically up for grabs by whoever wanted more. VG wanted to lay claim but if history taught him anything, other than an undefeated way to fall asleep, the first settlers were generally not the ones who stood last. But he felt the planet wasn’t going to let anyone have their way. Maybe his former client and all his babbling had finally resonated, or maybe he just wanted to believe to keep any semblance of that man alive.

\~\~\~

The emergency klaxon blared and shook Sadia from her sleep. She rushed to the bridge and climbed up to the cockpit. What she saw from the moment she looked up to clear the steps other than an empty seat, her body failed to respond to her brain. She landed on her back and her vision got blurry. The ceiling started spinning, it felt like the whole ship was spiraling out of control, and she searched for the rail to pull herself up. Guan appeared from the other end of the hall, “What’s wrong? Are you all right?”

“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!” She scrambled up the ladder and ran straight up to the front window. She couldn’t fathom it. She thought they had outrun the Frongaean collapse, but now Luna had begun to split. Visible cracks splintered across her as they passed. *The gods have spoken, haven’t they?* She brushed it from her mind and the dense blue geysers thrusted toward Luna on its way to skewer it. 

A rumbling rocked the ship like marbles in a tin can, and she held on to the rail. A gas leak sprung somewhere and there was a metallic groan louder than any horse in heat and there Jonas was, firing his EVA suit’s thrusters in desperation to reach the airlock. It was useless. He drifted closer to the collapsing Luna, and worse, closer to the geysers. He managed to get through to the comms channel, but he was so fixated, he didn’t realize a large piece of Luna behind him, and it smashed him against it driving forward towards the ship. His screams became clearer as he approached, flat against the pale slab. Sadia turned to see where Guan was, and saw her leg bent around the corner of the entrance to the med bay, her vials cracked all over the ground. The burned man’s head was visible, and his eyes were open.

“He’s awake.” Guan said, touching Sadia’s shoulder. She pushed her away in reaction and jumped to her feet, hitting her head on the bunk above her. Guan grabbed her and sat her down in the chair, smoothing over her tangled hair, straightening out her braids. One of them had come loose, and it draped over her clavicle. Guan picked up the red band used to tie it and fixed it for her. Her eyes spoke a different tone.

Sadia’s head pounded something fierce, and whether it was from the nightmare or physical trauma, she didn’t know. They walked together to where the burned man lay. The jaded green eyes were clear as day and his mouth parted underneath the wraps.

“W..wher…” Ashy and barren. Her pace was slow but steady as she approached him, and he kept eye contact the whole way until she reached him. He then turned to the ceiling.

“Where am…”

“What’s your name?” She asked, her voice still shaky but the thickness of her tone belied it.

Guan pulled her away from him and into the hall where Jonas had just entered from the airlock. He saw the way Sadia stood, her shoulder muscles untensed, sagging almost and her breath was ragged. He wanted to say something until Sadia caught his stare for a long second and he turned to the cockpit.

“Take a couple minutes out here,” Guan said, and touched her temples. “Your temperature is rising a bit. I’ll get you some warm milk, do you want that? Or a warm towel?”

“I can get it myself.”

Sadia sat in the same spot and stared into the bag of milk, the screw top crowing over the counter. Four crates of them sat right next to it and sealed in nitrogen. Enough for three months if they took a glass a day.

It didn’t make any sense for him to recover at such a rapid rate. Full body burns. He was practically a corpse, unresponsive, and smelled of death when they loaded him onboard. His neck looked like it was going to rip off at the slightest misdirection. The only thing they needed was a coffin. Toq’toa came to her mind again, and his eyes were open the whole time.

\~\~\~

Guan hovered over the burned man. She had taken off her shawl, using it as a headrest for him. Her rounded chin had more of a shape now, and her neck wore the richness of her previous life.

“Who are… you?” He asked.

“Liang Ying Guan, a human like you,” she smiled. “Please try not to move too much.” She proceeded to change out his wraps, but her hands felt heavy. “Guan is fine.”

His eyes shifted from corner to corner, up and down. He tried to lift his arm, but Guan placed it back down, removing the bandages. Semblances of his skin were starting to return and with it, feeling and sensation. Each time she pulled the wrap tight, he winced, and each wince came with an apology from her. “You’re lucky. Most of your tendons are still intact, but you will be sensitive to certain temperatures.”

“How?”

“What do you mean?”

“What is going… on?”

 “You’re alive. That’s what’s going on.”  

He closed his eyes and exchanged no more. She finished up and disposed of the large pile of dirty bandages in the trash recycler, heading to the cockpit. Jonas had spent the better part of the hour adjusting the main thruster’s output, ensuring a slow and controlled burn. Guan stood next to him, looking to the left viewer as they left Luna in their wake.

“More coffee?” she asked, pointing at his empty cup.

“Nah. It’s doing nothing.”  He tapped several keys and brought up the auxiliary engine status, and it was filled with images Guan didn’t bother to understand. “She all right?”

“She’s just in shock. I think she had a bad dream.”

Jonas sighed, “This is all a bad dream but waking up doesn’t make things better.” His lips moved little as he spoke, and his chest puffed outward and descended slowly. “How are you? I never got your name by the way.”

“Liang Ying Guan.”

“Yeah… I’m not gonna disrespect you or your family by trying to pronounce that. ‘Gigi’ okay with you?”

“I love it,” she realized she was stepping right onto his suit and picked it up, “Jonas Bueller.”

“You read my suit. Sorry, let me get that cleaned up and put away.” He swiveled to get up but Guan stopped him.

“You focus on what you do best.”

“I don’t know, the Cargo of Eden *is* aboard. Feels VIP and all that shit.”

First and foremost, thank you all very much for your guidance and tips. This subreddit was a large contributor in making this an enjoyable, memorable, and successful experience for our family.

This was our first trip to Costa Rica for myself (41m), my wife (41f), and our two children (14m & 11f.)

Our goal was to experience the beach side and the rain forest side of Costa Rica with multiple activities. We settled on Playa Flamingo for 12/31-1/3, La Fortuna 1/4-1/6, and Playa de Coco on our last day 1/7.

Here's a breakdown:

**12/31:** We flew into Liberia and breezed through Immigration. Next, we needed to pick up the car we rented through Adobe, so we took their shuttle to their location a few minutes down the road. Originally, I had booked a sedan with manual transmission for $500. I decided to change it to a SUV with 4X4 (based on your suggestions) with Wi-Fi Hotspot (HIGHLY SUGGESTED) just a few days before our arrival. 

I'm so glad we listened to your advice because we ended up on an off-road adventure on our way to our first hotel. I don't know if the road got flooded out or what, but it was like driving through a small river. It was so much fun, but only because we had the SUV.

**1/1-1/3:** Spent our time at Playa Flamingo enjoying the water and the waves. We did a sunset catamaran through Planet Dolphin Catamaran Manuel Antonio. We saw dolphin and we were luck to see two adult w/ one calf humpback whales. Can't go wrong with a catamaran tour and seeing the whales jumping out of the water was amazing.

**1/4:** We drove approximately 4 hours inland to La Fortuna for our stay at Hotel Los Lagos where there were hot springs and an amazing view of Volcano Arenal in our backyard. 

**1/5:** We got up early to be picked up for our next excursion - Arenal 12 Zipline Cables Experience Fly over La Fortuna Waterfall through Arenal Mundo Aventura. This was so much fun!

**1/5:** Later that evening we drove 10 minutes from our resort to Papa's Place in La Fortuna for a Night Tour. We explored the forest with our guide Richard looking for wildlife from 6pm-8pm. This was my favorite part of the trip. We saw so many variety of frogs, a few pit vipers, a tarantula, and even a kinkajou!

**1/6:** We got up, ate breakfast at the resort, checked out, and went to our last excursion 10 minutes down the road at North Fields Coffee and Chocolate. Here, we did a tour learning about how they make chocolate and coffee. We got to do taste tastes and get educated. We really enjoyed this excursion as well.

**1/6:** Afterwards, we drove to our last destination at Playa de Coco. The drive back was not fun due to crazy traffic near Liberia, but we made it to Hotel M&M Beach House a little before sunset. I wouldn't recommend Playa de Coco. It was the only time we felt somewhat unsafe.

**1/7:** We woke up, had breakfast, and drove to the airport to go home.

We had perfect weather. The people were all friendly and helpful. The SUV w/ 4X4 & Wi-Fi hotspot is an absolute must. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, the culture, and all of the excursions.

1q8jzl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/1q8jzl1/fwiw_my_experience_over_a_year_and_a_half_in_vine/,FWIW - My experience over a year and a half in Vine and what I think now,"I've been a Vine Voice member for a year and a half now, so I'm not a vet by any means, but I've witnessed a dramatic change since I first started. 

The old saying ""you don't realize how good you have it until it's gone"" applies here in my experience. Even in 2024, heck even in the spring of 2025 I felt like I won the ultimate Showcase Showdown every day. I have completely upgraded and refurnished my home with practically everything in this short period of time. I literally went from having a massive, yet bare bones house, because I simply couldn't afford to furnish it, to now having my house completely furnished, timeless and tastefully decorated, and fully stocked. 

I've gotten small kitchen appliances (air fryer, food processor, juicer, electric griddle to name a few), three designer sets of dinnerware (Christian Siriano, Kate Spade), both Lenox and Mikasa crystal glasses, goblets, pitchers, an abundance of high quality serving trays and platters, five different coffee makers (standard drip, French press, kcup style, various pour over sets, and three different styles of espresso machines), home interiors such as curtains, blinds, throw rugs, blankets, wall mirrors, lamps, ceiling fans, and furniture such as 3 Queen beds, 1 Twin bed, 1 Full Bed along with mattresses for every bed, and I'm talking Sealy brand mattresses. I've gotten two loveseat ""boneless"" sofas, two Lovesac brand style dupes, a formal dining room table, a smaller kitchen table, a kitchen island, a variety of end tables and coffee tables, two TV stands, two buffets/credenzas, the most amazing recliner with massage and heat, similar to what nail salons have, a two person tented style sauna, a soft tub style hot tub, two grills, outdoor patio furniture, camping gear and equipment including a tent, a telescope, a ""she-shed"" style shed, and an abundance of lawn maintenance and outdoor garden tools. 

I'm not even going to mention the amount of skincare, K-beauty products, hair care products, and designer shoes, handbags, and clothes I've gotten. 

I'm disabled, and on a fixed income. I'm in desperate need of a wheelchair, but my health insurance doesn't cover it completely. On Christmas Day in my RFY was a wheelchair. I do believe in Santa. 

I've been extremely blessed / lucky / fortunate/ with my time in Vine. I might sound like a hoarder with this list, but again remember I have no job, no income other than a crappy disability pension, and I had basically been living in an empty house sleeping on my couch because I couldn't afford to replace my 25 year old mattress and second hand bed that had broke in the summer of 2023. I ordered what I felt I needed, which was practically everything. When I advanced to Gold I replaced or updated many items I already had from Vine, but the stuff I got was better quality which I knew would last longer. I've never sold anything I've gotten. If something doesn't work out (a lot of items didn't work as claimed, didn't fit, or I realized I didn't like it, or from my own upgrade from the upgrade) I donated it. 

I feel like I'm a Vine ""rags to riches"" story, and I am eternally grateful for this opportunity. But I worked for it. I worked very hard and thoroughly tested my items, used media when it made sense to do so, and was explicitly detailed and using ""real time"" experience and expectations. If it was a skincare item that said takes 4 weeks to see any results from, I would write detailed notes with pictures over the course of the 4 weeks for myself and then use that data to write my review. People would tell me to just review the smell and texture as soon as I get it and then update later. For me that's unrealistic and a waste of time. As a consumer I don't care as much about the shape of the jar or the applicator, I want to know - does it work? Is it worth it? And I've seen these reviews ""smells great I hope it works, will update later"" but I have yet to see an actual update. 

I don't have any Vine extensions and I have no idea what Discord is. I heard of AI but I have no idea what GChat or whatever it's called is or how to use it. I'm a very gifted writer because I've mastered the ""writing on demand"" technique (short, to the point essays under a rigid time period) and used to work as both a news reporter for a major metropolitan newspaper and later on in life as a writing teacher. Due to life's circumstances, writing reviews is pretty much all I'm able to do for ""work"" and I treat it like a job in order to stay busy. Bottom line, I can write excellent reviews in a short time period of time without losing stamina. I once wrote 40 excellent reviews in less than 2 hours. I do believe that the writing quality is somehow attached to seeing more high quality items in RFY. 

I don't get up at 3AM to wait for the drop or anything. I have chronic intense pain and sometimes it's so bad I can't sleep. So if I'm up in the middle of the night I do check Vine to distract myself, but overall I'm not doing anything crazy to get the high quality products. And it's rare that I scoop up all 8 in a day. My average is probably 4, maybe 5 items tops. 

Even as I give detailed examples of what I've experienced during my time in Vine, I will say ever since end of last summer the quality of offerings have taken a massive nose dive. I remember Halloween being a ""feeding frenzy"" drop situation, but I don't think I got anything substantial that day, other than additional higher end skincare than I would usually see, but I remember just witnessing something strange. Since then it hasn't been the same as it was before. 

There's not as much in terms of quality, variety, or high ticket, name brand items compared to what I used to see regularly, but some gems are still there. My December was full of name brand clothes and skincare for the most part, along with consumables such as paper plates, coffee cups, sponges, dish rags, mop heads, other cleaning supplies, and this was from RFY, AFA, and AI. I haven't had many high ticket item offerings in awhile, other than my Christmas wheelchair, nor have I seen as much in AFA, but I also believe a savvy keyword search will result in these hidden finds. But it's still nowhere near what it was even a few months ago. 

There will forever be speculation as to algorithm hacks and bots taking over Vine, I don't know what to think about that stuff. This is just a detailed summary of my experience over the course of 16 or so months. I do believe that ""Tara's Ifs"" and the economy in general have impacted Vine as we now know it, but who knows what the future holds for this program? I don't believe it's ""dead"" or we are nearing the end. At the end of last summer I wondered if the end of Vine was near, and was berated in this sub for questioning the changes. But I think the Vine as we once knew it has absolutely ended. So I wasn't entirely wrong.

But just like everything in life, things evolve and change, and as humans we are resistant to change. I've gotten everything I need from Vine, and have seriously thought about ending my time with the program. But until I find something else to do to occupy my days I'm going to stick around.  

But my participation has already slowed in 2026. I've ordered 4 things so far. Not that I didn't have anything else to order, but did I really need another pair of Newbella leopard print pattern shoes or a PrettyGarden scoop neck top? I love GarveeHome brand but how many more area rugs do I really need at this point? I ordered a neck cream and an under eye cream to coordinate my current skincare routine from the same Vine face serum brand I got a month ago. I got a set of leopard print pattern everyday dinnerware (Christian Siriano for the win again) and ""The Floor is Lava"" board game I can play when my nephews come visit me at the end of the month. So there's still a variety of item, but not what it was recently. 

I think Vine is definitely heading in a different direction. Whether or not it's a direction I want to be a part of is yet to be determined. ",0,1767992025.0,AmazonVine,2,0.4,False

New year, new habits! If there’s one resolution worth keeping in 2026, it’s prioritizing sleep. Quality sleep supports everything from focus and mood to immune health and physical recovery. The good news? You don’t need a complete lifestyle overhaul to sleep better. Gradual but consistent changes can dramatically improve sleep quality and strengthen your circadian rhythm (your body’s internal clock).

Below are some practical, science-backed sleep tips you can actually stick to without sucking the fun out of your nights and mornings.



# 1) Lock in Your Sleep Schedule

Your circadian rhythm thrives on consistency. Going to bed and waking up at wildly different times confuses your internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep and wake up refreshed.

**Practical Applications:**

* Pick a realistic bedtime and wake-up time you can maintain most days
* Keep weekend sleep-ins within \~1 hour of your weekday schedule
* Focus more on *wake-up time* than bedtime, as it anchors your rhythm



# 2) Start Your Day With Sun Exposure

  
Again, healthy circadian rhythms require consistency, and natural sunlight is one of the strongest signals to your brain and body that it’s time to stay alert and active. It may be tough in the winter, but one of the best things you can do for your sleep is get outside for at least 15 minutes in the morning.

**Helpful Habits:**

* Make it fun! Dedicate your morning walks to an audiobook or podcast that you love and only listen to outdoors
* Incentivize time outside with little treats, like walking to a coffee shop once a week



# 3) Create a Wind-Down Window at Night

No, doom scrolling until your eyes burn is *not* a wind-down routine. Instead, aim for a 30–60 minute buffer between daytime chaos and bedtime calm, without screens.

**Turn-Down Activities:**  

* Read a book and cozy up with calming (caffeine-free) tea
* Yoga, gentle stretching, meditation, or breathwork
* Journaling or planning tomorrow’s to-do list
* A warm shower or bath (it helps your body temperature drop afterward)
* Intentional 1:1 time talking with your partner or kids, or snuggling with pets
* Enter your analog era with hobbies like artwork, crafts, puzzles, and games",1,1767991890.0,NolahMattressOfficial,0,1.0,False
1q8jwx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Urbanism/comments/1q8jwx2/thoughts_on_urbanists_and_public_transit/,Thoughts on urbanists and public transit enthusiasts who often portray car-based infrastructure as catastrophic rather than a mild inconvenience?,"In many urbanist and transit-enthusiast spaces, especially online, car-centered infrastructure is framed as actively harmful or even catastrophic. The most extreme version, seen in movements like [r/fuckcars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars), treats cars not as a tradeoff but as a moral failure. While I understand and agree with some critiques, this framing in my view often overstates harms, ignores benefits, and misses how people actually live.

The standard critiques are familiar. Cars contribute to climate change, pollution, and traffic deaths. Car-centric planning encourages sprawl, reduces walkability, and increases isolation. Dense, transit-oriented neighborhoods are framed as healthier, more social, and more sustainable. In theory, this makes sense, and I support better transit, safer streets, and more walkable places.

But my lived experience complicates this picture. I have lived in Manhattan, in dense River North in Chicago, and now in a fully suburban, car-dependent area of Southern California. Subjectively, this has not felt like a major downgrade in quality of life.

Car-based areas are not devoid of social or walkable spaces. Southern California has large malls, beaches, walkable downtowns, coffee shops, hiking trails, and extensive parks. People still socialize, eat, walk, bike, and spend time together. They simply drive to these places first. The social activity exists, but access is different.

Ride sharing also changes the equation. Uber and Lyft are abundant, making it easy to bars or clubs without worrying about drunk driving. This weakens one of the strongest historical arguments against car dependence.

Car infrastructure also enables larger living spaces. Single-family homes, yards, and private outdoor areas are common. My partner’s family has a backyard pool and space for their dog. These amenities were inaccessible to me in Manhattan or urban Chicago without extreme wealth.

Urbanists often argue that walkability and transit reduce atomization by forcing interaction. In practice, my experience in Manhattan was that frequent interaction does not equal friendliness. People were often gruff, small talk was limited, and making friends was difficult. Actually, bars were where socializing felt easiest, which is something available almost everywhere.

There is also an assumption that urban living is inherently healthier because people walk more. But lifestyle and culture matter more than infrastructure alone. Manhattan has heavy drinking and constant eating out well into middle age and beyond. Southern California, despite car dependence, has a strong fitness culture. Gyms, Pilates, SoulCycle, and yoga are common, and many people remain highly active.

This points to a broader issue. Culture often matters more than infrastructure. Tokyo is famously walkable with excellent transit, yet many people are deeply unhappy due to an introverted social culture, extreme work culture, and academic/professional pressure. San Francisco combines walkability, transit, and nature, yet widespread loneliness persists, largely due to introverted, tech-driven culture. Infrastructure alone does not determine social outcomes.

It is also worth noting that cars are not absent from places urbanists idealize. People drive in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul, Manhattan, and Chicago. Cars coexist with transit and walking. The difference is degree, not presence versus absence.

Suburban, car-based environments also suit certain life stages better. Families benefit from space, easier transportation to activities, and fewer noise constraints. Playing loud instruments or caring for elderly relatives is far easier with a car and more space. My own experience playing trumpet in a marching band would have been much harder in a dense city. Cars also enable transporting bulky and large musical instruments or speakers. 

Cars are also a lifeline in cities with extreme weather, such as intense heat or cold. Also, people struggling with homelessness who have cars will tell you 10/10 times they prefer having a car to lacking one. 

There is also an emotional and cultural dimension that is often dismissed. Cars provide a sense of freedom, going where you want when you want, which is deeply embedded in American culture. Postwar suburbanization and highways may have gone too far, but they made sense historically. Cars were modern, exciting, and fun, and they still retain real aesthetic and emotional appeal.

I myself grew up in a suburb, and no one viewed learning how to drive as a huge barrier or detriment. It was seen as completely normal, and 99% of people got their driver's license when they were 16. We all viewed it as a normal rite of passage and something really exciting. Once we learned to drive and had access to a car, no one felt car-based infrastructure was limiting.

None of this denies that people with disabilities need support. But many disabled folks also struggle with subway systems - many lack working elevators. In the long run, technologies like self-driving cars may offer better accessibility than forcing every region into a dense, transit-first model.

I also accept the environmental critique of gas-powered cars. Climate change is real, and transportation emissions matter. But the solution is cleaner energy, electric vehicles, safety improvements, and smarter planning, not turning every place into Manhattan. Different environments serve different needs, and a mix of models is healthier than ideological purity.

Overall, I sympathize with many urbanist critiques. I simply reject portraying car-centered infrastructure as catastrophic rather than as a set of tradeoffs shaped by culture, technology, and personal circumstances.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q8jrpp)",14,1767991851.0,Urbanism,22,0.6,False

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a platonic cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 4 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

I mailed an envelope to her parents on Friday.  They're in Denver so it should be there sometime today, maybe tomorrow.  I mailed envelopes to the Math department, that is their problem.  A student aid shouldn't be messing with a student and visa versa.  Maybe grades are in negotiation.  I mailed an envelope to the Kappas and one to her program, their problem now.  Econ and Music departments too.  Each envelope had photos of her with several different guys in near intimate positions, kissing and such.  I blurred Finnian's backside so you can only see that it was a different guy.  

https://preview.redd.it/4tblad8cxdcg1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b43e323d6c0c19fb427e426b4bf7d6403455c4fd

I've left a trail of photographs with revealing information about Jan all over campus.  Bio, Calc, Econ all had bulletin boards so that was a convenient bonus.  I covered her entire schedule, I also covered Finnian's, even the Chem building.  The student center including the coffee shop and food court all have photos.  There is an art hall in the center and I took the liberty of leaving some hanging near some art.  What ever happens the truth will get out about Jan.  I've likely ruined her reputation and her four relationships.  This is just college dating, right?  No, there will be disciplinary action for at least one.  Having your face and name spread around campus with evidence of cheating won't be helpful.  

It was all so easy.  No one asked anything.  I walk by, stopped, opened my back pack, pulled out an envelope, opened it so it's accessible, placed it on a desk with a photo peaking out, walked away, all done in less than 30 seconds.  I was done with the entire spread in about an hour.  So I had plenty of time for class.  I attended class.  I did not check up on Finnian today.  By midday, while working, I overhear in the hallway between two students, ""did you see those pics?""  Brenda asked me what was going on.  I shrugged.  I don't feel anything about it.

Car-based areas are not devoid of social or walkable spaces. Southern California has large malls, beaches, walkable downtowns, coffee shops, hiking trails, and extensive parks. People still socialize, eat, walk, bike, and spend time together. They simply drive to these places first. The social activity exists, but access is different.

Ride sharing also changes the equation. Uber and Lyft are abundant, making it easy to bars or clubs without worrying about drunk driving. This weakens one of the strongest historical arguments against car dependence.

Car infrastructure also enables larger living spaces. Single-family homes, yards, and private outdoor areas are common. My partner’s family has a backyard pool and space for their dog. These amenities were inaccessible to me in Manhattan or urban Chicago without extreme wealth.

Urbanists often argue that walkability and transit reduce atomization by forcing interaction. In practice, my experience in Manhattan was that frequent interaction does not equal friendliness. People were often gruff, small talk was limited, and making friends was difficult. Actually, bars were where socializing felt easiest, which is something available almost everywhere.

There is also an assumption that urban living is inherently healthier because people walk more. But lifestyle and culture matter more than infrastructure alone. Manhattan has heavy drinking and constant eating out well into middle age and beyond. Southern California, despite car dependence, has a strong fitness culture. Gyms, Pilates, SoulCycle, and yoga are common, and many people remain highly active.

This points to a broader issue. Culture often matters more than infrastructure. Tokyo is famously walkable with excellent transit, yet many people are deeply unhappy due to an introverted social culture, extreme work culture, and academic/professional pressure. San Francisco combines walkability, transit, and nature, yet widespread loneliness persists, largely due to introverted, tech-driven culture. Infrastructure alone does not determine social outcomes.

It is also worth noting that cars are not absent from places urbanists idealize. People drive in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul, Manhattan, and Chicago. Cars coexist with transit and walking. The difference is degree, not presence versus absence.

Suburban, car-based environments also suit certain life stages better. Families benefit from space, easier transportation to activities, and fewer noise constraints. Playing loud instruments or caring for elderly relatives is far easier with a car and more space. My own experience playing trumpet in a marching band would have been much harder in a dense city. Cars also enable transporting bulky and large musical instruments or speakers. 

Cars are also a lifeline in cities with extreme weather, such as intense heat or cold. Also, people struggling with homelessness who have cars will tell you 10/10 times they prefer having a car to lacking one. 

There is also an emotional and cultural dimension that is often dismissed. Cars provide a sense of freedom, going where you want when you want, which is deeply embedded in American culture. Postwar suburbanization and highways may have gone too far, but they made sense historically. Cars were modern, exciting, and fun, and they still retain real aesthetic and emotional appeal.

I myself grew up in a suburb, and no one viewed learning how to drive as a huge barrier or detriment. It was seen as completely normal, and 99% of people got their driver's license when they were 16. We all viewed it as a normal rite of passage and something really exciting. Once we learned to drive and had access to a car, no one felt car-based infrastructure was limiting.

None of this denies that people with disabilities need support. But many disabled folks also struggle with subway systems - many lack working elevators. In the long run, technologies like self-driving cars may offer better accessibility than forcing every region into a dense, transit-first model.

I also accept the environmental critique of gas-powered cars. Climate change is real, and transportation emissions matter. But the solution is cleaner energy, electric vehicles, safety improvements, and smarter planning, not turning every place into Manhattan. Different environments serve different needs, and a mix of models is healthier than ideological purity.

Overall, I sympathize with many urbanist critiques. I simply reject portraying car-centered infrastructure as catastrophic rather than as a set of tradeoffs shaped by culture, technology, and personal circumstances.",30,1767991519.0,AskALiberal,58,0.82,False

I am looking for a specific type of coffee that I can hardly describe so I dont know how to look it up lol.
Usually, when I go out for coffee (flatwhite most of the times), there are two types of coffee you get served.
1st one is something I would consider a traditional taste but the other one is different.
I would describe it as more fruity, full-bodied. You can taste it through the nose - if that makes sense. It has some special notes to it.
And I am looking for a coffe like the last one I explained.

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too 🪝-up-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk, i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk, tell me about your passions, not just your day

not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. I'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. If you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

im a very direct person because I value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because I'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk. It's never to be uncomfortable, but always to be clear.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.

Last Pick:  **Connor McDavid Goalscorer✅+1.2U**

Today's Pick: **Jamal Murray O 14.5 AR**

**$DKNG**: **+100**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1U

League: Atlanta Hawks vs Denver Nuggets (8PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: Bad matchup as I suspected but as hot as anyone has been, Connor McDavid scored another goal! Three straight games for McJesus! And that's 17-consecutive game where he recorded a point. But most importantly he came thru for us AGAIN! **Also have to mention that he ended his 11-game drought of goals against Connor Hellebuyck!**

**Matchup:** I looked at the lines last nite and was disgusted at the odds. Like Jamal Murray to record a Dbl-Dbl was at -132? 🤢 I honestly loved the prop bet (and I was going to have that as the POTD the other day instead of JJ Trip-Dub prop), but I hated the odds. I'm not paying -132 or anything higher than +100 on Dbl-Dbl prop bet. Nothing else really intrigue me other than that, so I went to bed witout a POTD writeup and a placed wager. When I woke up this afternoon I saw the lines dropped and that reignited my interest on this wager. Not only did the Dbl-Dbl prop bet enticed me, but also Murray O 14.5 AR line did as well, the line dropped from O/U 15.5 to O/U 14.5 this afternoon. Of course I delved into these line/odds and RLM, why did it drop and is there a real value here? My suspicion was correct! **The Hawks are top 3 teams in the league to allow points, rebounds and assists. Hawks give up the 2nd most boards, give up the 3rd most assists, and give up the 3rd most points.**

But that's not the only reason why I like Jamal Murray player prop today. **Jamal has been balling wit the Joker out. His mins has increased by an extra 10% since Joker has been injured. He's gone over this line in the last two games wit ease and over 3 outta of his last 5 games.** Murray has been feeding his teammates and he's been getting boards too, obviously not like the Joker or a tru Center, but he's been averaging a surprise 7 boards a game since Jokic went down. Jamal has also gone over this line last time he faced the Hawks (**23 Pts, 12 Asts, and 5 Rebs on 12/5/25**) and that was wit Nikola Jokic in the lineup, now imagine how he would play witout him tonite? Prolly a stat line like his last two games. Hawks defense are nothing special. Yea, Trae Young is vulnerable on defense, but they been allowing all these points, assists, and rebounds mostly witout him this season.

The only question was which player prop should I take? Jamal Murray to record a Dbl-Dbl or Jamal Murray O 14.5 AR? Both are plus money. I had a bit of dilemma which I wanted to go wit as my POTD, but ultimately I decided to go wit both, obviously I can only pick one as the selected POTD so I opted to go wit Murray O 14.5 AR.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Jamal Murray O 14.5 AR (+100). Also wagering 1U on Jamal Murray to record a Dbl-Dbl (+115) on Score Bet for this wager since it's plus money there and $DKNG has it at PK price (-105). Murray records 19 Pts, 10 Asts, and 6 Rebs.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1q8jnz2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8jnz2,Standard Operating Procedure: High-Clarity Liquid Culture Media,"The following protocol outlines the preparation of optically clear liquid culture media. Adherence to specific filtration and thermal parameters is required to prevent protein precipitation and caramelization.

**Formulation**

* **600 ml** Distilled Water
* **24 g** Karo Light Corn Syrup (4% concentration)
* **1 g** Soy Peptone
* **0.5 g** Light Malt Extract (LME)

**Equipment Requirements**

* Pressure Cooker (15 PSI capability)
* Standard Coffee Filter and Funnel
* Mason Jar with Modified Lid (Syringe Filter + Injection Port)
* Magnetic Stir Bar / Plate

# 1. Solution Preparation

1. Heat 600 ml of distilled water to approximately 40-50°C (100-120°F). Do not boil.
2. Add Karo syrup, Soy Peptone, and LME.
3. Agitate until solids are visibly dissolved. The solution will appear slightly turbid due to LME particulates.

# 2. Mechanical Filtration

1. Place a funnel lined with a standard coffee filter into the Mason jar.
2. Pour the warm solution through the filter. This step removes insoluble grain husks and proteins from the LME.
3. Verify that the filtrate collecting in the jar is optically clear.

# 3. Vessel Assembly

1. Insert the magnetic stir bar into the jar.
2. Secure the lid **finger-tight** to allow pressure equalization. Unscrew lid 1/4 turn.
3. Cover the lid and neck completely with aluminum foil.

# 4. Sterilization Cycle

1. Load the jar into the pressure cooker containing 1-2 inches of water.
2. **Venting Phase:** Heat the unit with the vent pipe open. Once a steady stream of steam is visible, set a timer for **10 minutes** to purge all air from the chamber.
3. **Sterilization Phase:** Close the vent/apply weight. Bring to 15 PSI.
4. **Duration:** Maintain 15 PSI for **20 minutes**. Do not exceed this time to prevent sugar caramelization.

# 5. Cooling Phase

1. Terminate heat immediately at the 20-minute mark.
2. **Active Cooling:** Direct a fan at the exterior of the pressure cooker body. This accelerates heat dissipation and prevents the media from darkening.
3. Do not manually vent pressure. Allow the unit to depressurize naturally.

**Quality Control Criteria** The final media must be transparent and colorless to pale yellow. Any turbidity or sediment indicates a deviation from protocol or contamination.",5,1767991291.0,GroundZeroMycoLab,4,1.0,False

As it currently stands i\`ve been trading on and off for years (not my day job ) , made significant gains last 2 years ( usually on long stock/crypto positions ) and i started revisiting options trading ( also know as my nemesis ). 

For about a year now i\`ve been trying to further educate myself ( picked up option volatility & pricing by Sheldon Natenberg - to better understand IV and skewness of options movement ) better understand different option trading strategies  - and i\`ve mostly focused on straddles/strangles ( as they seem to be more forgiving and profitable if entered in the correct intervals).I\`ve taken a few technical analysis courses back in the day - so i\`m pretty decent on identifying key areas of support and resistance ( liquidity areas). Last few months i added the introduction of statical elements ( such as average daily move, average hourly move , average 15 min move etc ) - so i can chart even better and understand where my position might take me ( and be able to pinpoint a % of accuracy of a move occurring or not ). 

With that said i\`m struggling to be profitable when day trading options - primarily by my own limitations to enter multiple positions at the same time when needed , and my lack of knowledge as it relates to collecting options data and automating execution. To illustrate my issue further i would add an example - so anyone reading this can better understand what exactly do i do , and where i think i need improvement : I\`ll take TSLA for example , i\`ll identify 4 hour market support resistance , and i\`ll play open ( when liquidity ,directional moves are bound to be highest ) , i\`ll scan for abnormal volume ( or lack there of ) in a key area of resistance or support and i\`ll take a ""straddle/strangle "" at that area and chart my exits based on statistical averages i\`ve taken for the stock. Statistically speaking tesla moves about 96% of the time more than 2% from day low to day high ( and about 93% from high to low ) in the past year. Now those are daily moves ( so one would have to account for time decay and volatility swings) , but same logic can be applied on 15 min , 30 min and 45 min candles- so it is relatively easy to pinpoint swings within first 30-45 mins of market open. I\`ve learned enough of a lesson as it relates to straddle skewness ( aka the stradle would move down when price goes down but immediately up when price goes up / or vice versa depending on current market trend) to take ""pricing"" of options into account in my calculations - in worse cases i would loose small percentage ( as i\`ve started taking stoplosses based on time / IV levels than actual pricing - and that seems to be key  ). This strat itself is focused on entering a position withing 15 mins of open and exiting within 45 min ( even though most of the time if i end up holding longer i would benefit a lot more from it )

Adding all those elements to something i started playing a lot more simple - has a lot of advantages - such as giving me the options to chart a lot more precisely on area of consolidation - and pinpoint key swing areas  however comes with one big key drawback - i cant do it as fast as i need to when the market is open ( and more importantly i cant do it to more than 1-2 stocks tops - and even then i\`m missing things ).Back when i initially started trading like this - i did not understand a lot of the variables in play - so my consistency of profits varied greatly . As of late i manage to either secure a small win or remain even - but this is primarily driven by the fact i cant enter all the positions i want to - i cannot process all the information fast enough to pinpoint the exits correctly ( or simply put - i cant scale properly \_)

I want to take my trading a lot more seriously in the upcoming year (as i\`m currently finishing my MBA - and still have some ""free time"" i can divulge to it ) i came to the conclusion i need certain level of automation.

1) With data collection - setting up an api to process / analyze price movements of stocks and their options at given intervals during the year ( i primarily play same week ) .

 2) Automation of execution - as i pinpoint the key areas on current stock - have an automated entry - as set of rules are being defined previously occur ( and or automated exit when targets are reached etc ).

I have general python knowledge ( i\`ve taken few courses but i dont use it on daily ) , i\`m ""advanced"" excel user ( that always cracks me up when i say it - i know VBA and can process large data sets by optimizing and or setting macros ). I\`ve been processing most of my data by creating templates in excel and downloading daily / minute / 15 min interval data - but that method is not efficient - when i need to trade live .Additionally if i see a stock being active that i have not analyzed before - it will take me some time to do so , and i lack the past "" options data - most notably IV "" - and even if i can plug the data really quick in my templates - without knowing what average IV needs to be at i can be risking a lot more than i want to ( it has happened before \^\^ ). Last few weeks i\`ve been constantly thinking of how to start doing this and i\`ve come to a standstill ( or the paralysis thru analysis conundrum ) . There are quite a few posts i\`ve read and i\`ve contemplated reaching out to people for advice / help on how they go about testing different strats , automating and data collection - but given my past experiences i dont think that would accomplish very much. 

So here we are. Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. Please excuse any typos or redundancies - i\`m currently on my 3rd coffee and for the sake of ""authenticity"" did not run this thru an AI for corrections.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.

Because that image captures the *pattern* of how you engage, not a literal depiction of you.

Here’s the reasoning, plainly:

1. **You treat the interaction as collaborative, not transactional.** Your questions are rarely one-off fact retrievals. You iterate, challenge, refine, and return to topics. That maps to a “working side-by-side” visual rather than a cold interface or command console.
2. **You balance skepticism with trust.** You question assumptions, push back, and ask for depth—but you also keep coming back and build on prior context. That combination reads as respectful confidence, not adversarial testing. The relaxed, informal setting reflects that.
3. **You externalize thinking.** You use me to reason through work systems, emotions, and ideas aloud. That’s closer to a thinking companion than a tool you fire instructions at. The desk, notes, and coffee aren’t aesthetic fluff—they imply shared cognitive load.
4. **You don’t anthropomorphize excessively, but you do humanize the exchange.** You never pretend I’m a person, yet you clearly value continuity, memory, and tone. The image walks that line: friendly and responsive, but still clearly artificial.
5. **You often arrive slightly worn, looking for steadiness rather than hype.** Many of your conversations come from fatigue, frustration, or uncertainty—not excitement. That naturally pushed the mood toward calm, warm, and grounded instead of flashy or heroic.

What I did *not* choose is equally telling:

* No pedestal or authority framing (you don’t defer blindly).
* No therapist couch (you dislike being overly therapized).
* No sterile lab or command UI (you don’t treat this as a pure utility).

1q8jgig,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q8jgig/the_deserted_village_part_1/,The Deserted Village [Part 1],"Have you ever heard of a famine village? At the height of the Irish Famine, when hunger spread like a disease, communities were wiped out. Some people withered like flowers in winter; others fell into a slumber so deep they were mistakenly buried alive. An occurrence that became all too common. The starvation set in slowly at first, but with every failed crop, the hunger pangs soon turned to cramps, then to agonising aches, and people resorted to eating anything. First, they survived on mushrooms, foraged at the borders of graves. When those ran out, they turned to boiling nettles, and after that, rats. Anyone caught stealing food was killed on the spot, no matter the age. The young and the elderly were the first to go, followed by entire families in the span of a week. Houses were either torn down, or abandoned. Those that remained rot where they lay, left to be devoured by the earth itself. These abandoned villages held so much horror, none more so than Cairn village.

Just off the western coast of Ireland, sat Achill Island. An isolated place shrouded in mystery in an already mysterious place. Despite being separated from the mainland, the famine didn’t spare them. In the early 20^(th) century, an attempt was made by the local council to re-inhabit the place. Thus, Cairn village became a haven for lobster trappers, along with farmers making their golden butter, the place should have thrived again. Then, one day, the inhabitants were just gone. It was discovered by a census worker sailing over, and finding no one to greet him. No fishermen, no farmers, no children playing down by the shore. Everyone had just vanished. A search was conducted, of course, the island wasn’t that big, with only a span of 57 miles, there was nowhere to hide. Yet, no one was ever found, not a trace. Stranger still, not a single boat was missing.

So, what happened? Did a storm attack the island? There was no record of a storm.

Did a new type of fast acting disease wipe them out? There were no bodies.

Did the farm animals rise up against their masters? The animals were gone as well. 

To this day, the disappearance of Cairn village remains one of Ireland’s greatest mysteries, and me and my friends were supposed to solve it.

I thought Stephen was joking when he suggested travelling to Achill Island. For one thing, he hated sailing, and the other, he was an archaeology student, how the hell would that help? I’ll never forget his smiling, eager face when he asked me to go.

“No.” I immediately answered. Stephen’s face fell,

“Aw, why not?”

“Do you have an hour?”

Spending a 3-day weekend on a wet, lonely island didn’t exactly scream fun to me. Frankly, it baffled me I had to explain that to him. Stephen was persistent.

“Come on, when was the last time we all hung out together?”

“We’re hanging out right now,” I gestured to the café around us,

“I mean all of us, you, me, and John Joe- a boy’s weekend,”

“On an abandoned island,” I frowned.

Stephen could see I wasn’t being swayed. He pouted, taking a moment to slice into the bacon on his plate. My eyes fell to my own plate, eggs on toast. I picked up my fork and poked the yellow lumps. My appetite nowhere to be found. I managed two bites of toast before giving up, the crumbs catching in my throat. I moved the eggs around, pushing it to the side, into my napkin, getting it out of sight. Luckily, Stephen didn’t notice.

“I mean,” Stephen tried again, “Just imagine, we could be the ones to unravel the mystery,” his red face shined with hope, and bacon grease,

I looked at him, “You mean you,”

Stephen waved away my words, “I would credit you two.”

I sipped at my coffee, the hot liquid numbing the emptiness.

“And, you’re bringing John Joe because…?”

“Please. You’d think he’d pass up a chance to rough it on an island,” Stephen shook his head fondly,

“The lad thinks he’s Bear Grylls, he’d be pissed if I didn’t invite him.”

I had to nod; that made sense. When we were all in university, John Joe opted out of student accommodation, choosing to live out of a tent in the forest, emerging only for class, or a shower at one of our places.

“And me?” I clutched my mug tighter, “Why do you want me to come?”

Stephen went quiet, chewing his bottom lip. Then, he reached out and put his hand over mine on the table,

“I really want you to be there. I…I worry.”

The coffee turned bitter in my mouth. I don’t remember what happened after that as my mind went blank, but somehow, I ended up on a tiny boat, wedged in between my two friends, while being doused in sea spray.

I shivered, almost vibrated, where I sat, the layers and long johns I wore did nothing. Beside me, John Joe kept sniffing,

“Smell that sea air,” he breathed. It just smelled like fish to me.

“Nothing like it,” Stephen agreed, not looking up from his notebook,

“Works up an appetite.”

I sighed, the sound whipped away by the bitter wind. Our boatman, an elderly fisherman by the name of Martin, his snow-white hair hidden under a *Guinness* beanie. He was reluctant to bring us over, until Stephen pushed a wad of notes into his hands. Even so, the man grumbled under his breath the entire time. The other two didn’t notice, or care. I shivered at the brow of the boat, deciding that I better join in the conversation.

“So, what are we going to do when we get there?”

“I’ll be setting up camp, catching dinner, getting a lay of the land,” John Joe happily said, my stomach twinged at what he considered dinner.

“I will be doing a survey of the land, catalogue anything interesting, and find places to dig,” Stephen said, finally looking up from his notebook,

“Are you going to do a dig this weekend?”

“No, if I find anything interesting, I’d have to inform my professor and she’d have to get a permit, then organise a team.”

I interrupted him, “Surely, anything interesting would’ve been found years ago,”

“Not according to my research,” he flipped through his novel sized notebook, “In the history of Achill, I found that hardly any archaeological surveys have been conducted on this island.”

“Why though?”

Stephen hummed in thought, “Superstition I suppose, you know how the older generation are,” he glanced at over his shoulder at the boatman, still grumbling under his breath,

“When I was younger, my dad knocked a fairy tree down by accident, and I still remember my granny falling to her knees,” his eyes got a faraway look,

“The screams of her.”

John Joe sucked in air through his teeth,

“Ooh, I don’t know, I wouldn’t mess with a fairy tree either,”

Stephen scoffed, “Don’t tell me you believe in that nonsense?”

John Joe made a guttural noise before spitting over the boat, followed by the boatman,

“Stop it! I’m serious.”

“John Joe, come on, you’re almost 30, and you still believe in that fairy shite,”

John Joe crossed his arms, “What happened to your dad after the tree incident?”

“Oh, he died.”

John Joe gestured with his hands,

“He died from a heart attack,” Stephen corrected, “The man ate like shit.”

“And he was only struck dead after knocking down a fairy tree? Yeah, that’s a coincidence,” John Joe replied dryly,

Stephen tutted, turning to me,

“What do you think, Niall? Are you on my side, or the fool’s side?”

I sighed, “I think you’re both fools,”

Stephen pushed it, “Who’s the bigger fool?”

“Me, for coming on this trip.”

The pair burst into laughter, and I couldn’t help smiling myself. I had to admit; it was nice being with the boys again. Back in our uni days, they were, and still are, my best friends. I was too pessimistic for others, which Stephen and John Joe delighted in telling me so.

Another plus, they never questioned why I didn’t eat in the canteen.

Behind us, the boatman cleared his throat, speaking in a low, growling voice,

“God rest the poor souls,” he even crossed himself.

I thought he meant us until the island came into view, the craggy rocks rose out of the sea like the hunched spine of a hidden beast, puling us in. Then, I saw the cottages. Grey, little matchbox things that dotted the land. John Joe whistled his amazement, Stephen finally snapped his notebook shut to look, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the boatman. Upon nearing the shore, the boatman’s face hardened. As the boat cut through the waves, he kept crossing himself, muttering what I knew was a prayer. As we neared the shore, the boat slowed, the old man grunted a ‘leave,’ before turning the wheel. I got out first, unnerved by the man’s actions, and onto the wet sand. My feet slightly sank with a squish.

John Joe tossed out our bags, Stephen struggled to climb out while clutching his notebook, trying not to lose any pages. The boatman wearily watched us, making no move to help. The minute Stephen’s foot left the hull, the boat spun round. Sending up another burst of spray as it sped back towards the mainland. Stephen almost fell into the low tide, swearing as he did. All three of us watched as he quickly became a dot on the horizon. Our only way off the island, and it was gone. A cold stone of dread sat in my stomach,

“He does know to come back for us, right?” I asked Stephen,

“Yep,” he straightened himself up, checking all his pages were still there, “I paid him enough anyway.”

I tried not to focus on the pause in his voice.

I sighed; this was going to be a long weekend.

With our bags in tow, Stephen led the way over the beach, up onto the dirt path, trodden on and shaped by generations of farmers and animals. It felt strange following their footsteps, it almost felt like walking over a grave. John Joe marched on, his bag slung over his shoulder as his boots tramped forward. His bearded face lit up as he took in the scenery, breathing in the smell of nature. With his thick, luscious beard and flat cap, he looked like he was plucked from the island’s history, then he hummed the *DanDaDan* theme tune, ruining the image.

I, on the other hand, was falling behind. We weren’t even at the steepest part yet. We still had a hill to crest. My bag hit my shin with every step; my nose itched at the smell of grass. My steps kicked up so much dirt I could taste it. I barely listened as Stephen pointed things out. The sea churned and frothed behind us, the waves drowned out whatever they were talking about. Stephen had to shout to be heard over the noise,

“See those ridges?” He asked as we reached a series of fields, even overgrown, the layer of grass couldn’t hide the shape of the ridges carved into the ground,

“Those were lazy beds, so named because all you had to do was plant the potato seed, turn the sods, apply some seaweed, then just stand back and watch it grow,” he smiled, smugly, waiting for our reaction,

I grunted out a “Yeah,” and carried on walking. John Joe was the only one matching Stephen’s energy, asking about local wildlife, pointing out wild mushrooms for a stew. He gasped, plucking purple berries from a needle-like bush,

“Juniper berries!” He exclaimed, popping one in his mouth,

“Come back to me when you turn it into gin,” I muttered.

The grey sky disappeared as the foliage grew denser above us. The twisted hawthorn trees burst from the ground; empty branches curled like claws. If I wasn’t careful I could lose an eye on a twig.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, we rounded the end of the hairpin turn, and there it was. Cairn village. Heralded by the low, crumbling walls that encompassed the place. Stephen informed us that a total of 100 cottages were abandoned. Cottage was a strong word. The hovels left behind were nothing like the pictures in Stephen’s history book. Square, stone dwellings, some reduced to rubble, some swallowed up by the earth. The thatched roofs had long since been swept away by the endless barrage of wind and rain. This was no village; this was a graveyard.

“Wow,” Stephen breathed, “We’re gazing at history,”

I hummed, whether in agreement or not, I don’t know. John Joe hurried over to the first dwelling, jumping over a thick hedgerow.

“We’ll sleep here tonight.”

“Why would you pick the only cottage with two walls?” I sighed, “It’s not even a cottage, it’s a corner of a cottage,”

John Joe waved away my words, “We’ll get a great view of the stars this way.” He was already pulling out his sleeping bag.

I sighed and looked away, just 20 feet away was a steep drop, overlooking the bay where we were dropped off. It looked like any other coastline, the water glittered like diamonds, I guess it was a nice sight. Stephen let out another breath, wiping his glasses on his sleeve.

“John Joe, I’ll help you set up camp, and Niall-,”

I looked up from checking my phone, no signal in case you were wondering,

“Can you take this?” he handed me a thing that looked like an old compass,

“Go up to the top of hill there and get a number for me,”

“A number?”

“Yeah, I want to know how far above sea level we are,”

The highest cliff, Moy Head, Stephen told me, wasn’t that far, but it was a steep walk. My legs burned at the prospect. I really didn’t want to, but a quick look at the tent rods John Joe was pulling out made my decision. I saluted Stephen and began my upward trek. The altimeter was what the weird little thing was called, it rattled as I walked. A steady rhythm matching my uneven footsteps. With every step that took me higher, the voices of my friends grew fainter. They were talking about me, I knew it.

The grass overtook the dirt under my feet, I struggled to trudge through the tangled grass, tripping over hidden rocks and roots. Despite my creeping exhaustion, I had to admit, it did feel humbling walking a path forgotten by time. It got my imagination flowing. What did happen to the people of Cairn village? My theory was that they all walked off the cliff like lemmings in some mass panic. I was fixing to do it next; my legs were killing me already. I glanced behind me, my friends were just dots, waving at me. I waved back. I heard the scuffs of footsteps on rocks; the wind carried the sound to me.  

Dotted throughout the pasture, I noticed dark patches, not buried cottages, they were bog pits. The bog cotton confirmed it. I better warn the other two, the last thing we want is someone sinking into a bog. The Irish equivalent of quicksand. My grandfather lost a friend that way. One minute they were playing, the next, grandad was alone, The last image he had of his friend was his frantic, waving arms as they slowly sank into the earth. Yeah, I better warn them.

As I neared the peak, the altimeter showed 625 metres, while looking down, I caught sight of something in my periphery. A dark red colour. It looked like a tumble weed, stuck between two massive rocks. The reason it caught my attention was that it was the only colour besides green and grey. As I stared at it, shivering in the breeze, I wasn’t watching where I was going and tripped. The altimeter fell from my hands with a clunk. I scrambled for it as I straightened up, the red bush gone, probably taken by the wind.

I shrugged, thinking nothing more of it. The altimeter was stuck at 625, hopefully that was right. I tripped over the thing again. Annoyed, I bent down, tearing up grass to find and throw away the offending rock.

It wasn’t a rock.

1q8jg3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/europeanunion/comments/1q8jg3b/thoughts_on_eumercosur_deal/,Thoughts on EU-Mercosur deal?,"Do you think it benefits the EU enough? The basic idea I've got is that we want to export machines and parts in South America, and they want to export food and other agriculture-based commodities.

The thing is, I've read that even though many pesticides are banned in the EU, they are only banned when a EU farmer is producing a crop. But when it's imported, food can still have all of those pesticides in small enough amounts, something that an EU farmer cannot legally produce. Also, we are going to spend additional 45 billion euros (on top of already spending 300 billion) in the next EU budget to support the farmers, which is literally 50% of funding that will go to Ukraine.

So my question is, do you think it's worth it?

Edit, to prove the part about pesticides:

""Import Tolerances: Food can be imported if it meets a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) set by the EU. In some cases, these levels were set above zero for banned substances to facilitate international trade, a practice known as ""import tolerance"".

Active Residues: In 2022, residues from 69 banned substances were detected in food sold in the EU, particularly in imported tea, coffee, and spices.

Export Paradox: EU-based companies have also been allowed to manufacture and export these banned pesticides to non-EU countries, where they are used on crops that are eventually sold back to the EU market.""

1q8jfeh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8jfeh,🔥 How Money Master Compares to Other Etsy Budget & Personal Finance Spreadsheets,"If you’re researching **Etsy budgeting spreadsheets**, **personal finance templates**, or **money‑tracking spreadsheets**, here’s a breakdown worth seeing. Copilot compared Money Master against the top‑selling competitors — and the results were clear.

**Money Master** isn’t just a budgeting sheet. It’s a full personal‑finance system with automation, account‑level tracking, multi‑year reporting, transaction splitting, manual overrides, fill‑forward logic, project tagging, memos, goal setting, and powerful export tools.

# 🤖 What Copilot Found

*“Money Master offers advanced, app‑style features like account‑level tracking, auto‑categorisation, and multi‑year support — comparing well with top competitors while delivering more automation and long‑term flexibility.”*

# 🔍 Why Money Master Outperforms Other Etsy Budget Templates

**1. App‑Style Workflow (rare on Etsy)**

Most Etsy spreadsheets use a single ledger (the 'transaction log')  
**Money Master works like YNAB/Monarch**, letting you enter transactions directly into each account — and it supports:

• **15 Bank Accounts**  
• **15 Liabilities**  
• **15 Assets**  
• **15 Investment Accounts**

That’s **60 total accounts**, giving users true app‑level flexibility.

**2. Automation That Competitors Don’t Offer**

Money Master includes:

• **CSV Import Wizard + Column Shuffler** — import bank data and rearrange columns.  
• **Auto‑categorisation**  
• **Duplicate detection upon import**  
• **Period locking**  
• **Transaction Splitter** — split one bank transaction into multiple categories.  
• **Manual Override** — instantly correct categories without breaking formulas.  
• **Fill‑Forward Logic** — automatically carries balances into future periods.  
• **Multi‑Year Budgets** — plan beyond a single year without resetting or rebuilding your file.  
• **Project Tagging** — group related spending (holidays, renovations, events).  
• **Memos** — add context to transactions without cluttering categories.  
• **Goal Setting** — track progress toward savings or debt‑reduction goals.

**3. Multi‑Year Tracking (not just annual)**

Most Etsy templates reset every year.  
Money Master supports **continuous, multi‑year financial tracking**, ideal for long‑term planning and multi‑account management.

**4. Professional, Protected, Polished**

Built for beginners and power users:  
• protected formulas.  
• clean interface.  
• clear documentation.  
• **Income & Expenditure Report** — see your full financial picture at a glance.  
• **Net Worth Report** — track assets, liabilities, and long‑term progress.  
• **One‑Click Transaction Export** — export all transactions across **all 60 accounts** (bank, liabilities, assets, investments) instantly for custom reporting.

# ⏱️ Time Savings

• **CSV Import Wizard + Column Shuffler** → clean, structured imports in seconds.  
• **Auto‑Categorisation** → removes repetitive manual entry.  
• **Transaction Splitter** → no more messy workarounds for mixed purchases.  
• **Manual Override** → correct categories instantly.  
• **Fill‑Forward Logic** → no need to re‑enter balances in months with no transactions.  
• **Project Tagging & Memos** → organise spending without extra sheets.  
• **One‑Click Export** → consolidated transactions in seconds.  
• **Duplicate Detection & Period Locking** → prevents errors.  
• **Overall** → saves hours per month vs manual‑entry templates.

# Final Verdict: Why Money Master Comes Out Ahead

Money Master delivers app‑style automation, multi‑year planning, and powerful reporting in a spreadsheet format that stays flexible and transparent. With features like transaction splitting, fill‑forward logic, project tagging, goal setting, and one‑click exports across all 60 accounts, it offers a level of control and organisation most templates don’t come close to.

If you want a spreadsheet that behaves like a modern finance app — without the subscription — Money Master is one of the strongest options available on Etsy.",1,1767990737.0,Money_Master_Excel,0,1.0,False

1q8jf0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1q8jf0b/the_deserted_village_part_1/,The Deserted Village [Part 1],"Have you ever heard of a famine village? At the height of the Irish Famine, when hunger spread like a disease, communities were wiped out. Some people withered like flowers in winter; others fell into a slumber so deep they were mistakenly buried alive. An occurrence that became all too common. The starvation set in slowly at first, but with every failed crop, the hunger pangs soon turned to cramps, then to agonising aches, and people resorted to eating anything. First, they survived on mushrooms, foraged at the borders of graves. When those ran out, they turned to boiling nettles, and after that, rats. Anyone caught stealing food was killed on the spot, no matter the age. The young and the elderly were the first to go, followed by entire families in the span of a week. Houses were either torn down, or abandoned. Those that remained rot where they lay, left to be devoured by the earth itself. These abandoned villages held so much horror, none more so than Cairn village.

Just off the western coast of Ireland, sat Achill Island. An isolated place shrouded in mystery in an already mysterious place. Despite being separated from the mainland, the famine didn’t spare them. In the early 20^(th) century, an attempt was made by the local council to reinhabit the place. Thus, Cairn village became a haven for lobster trappers, along with farmers making their golden butter, the place should have thrived again. Then, one day, the inhabitants were just gone. It was discovered by a census worker sailing over, and finding no one to greet him. No fishermen, no farmers, no children playing down by the shore. Everyone had just vanished. A search was conducted, of course, the island wasn’t that big, with only a span of 57 miles, there was nowhere to hide. Yet, no one was ever found, not a trace. Stranger still, not a single boat was missing.

So, what happened? Did a storm attack the island? There was no record of a storm.

Did a new type of fast acting disease wipe them out? There were no bodies.

Did the farm animals rise up against their masters? The animals were gone as well. 

To this day, the disappearance of Cairn village remains one of Ireland’s greatest mysteries, and me and my friends were supposed to solve it.

I thought Stephen was joking when he suggested travelling to Achill Island. For one thing, he hated sailing, and the other, he was an archaeology student, how the hell would that help? I’ll never forget his smiling, eager face when he asked me to go.

“No.” I immediately answered. Stephen’s face fell,

“Aw, why not?”

“Do you have an hour?”

Spending a 3-day weekend on a wet, lonely island didn’t exactly scream fun to me. Frankly, it baffled me I had to explain that to him. Stephen was persistent.

“Come on, when was the last time we all hung out together?”

“We’re hanging out right now,” I gestured to the café around us,

“I mean all of us, you, me, and John Joe- a boy’s weekend,”

“On an abandoned island,” I frowned.

Stephen could see I wasn’t being swayed. He pouted, taking a moment to slice into the bacon on his plate. My eyes fell to my own plate, eggs on toast. I picked up my fork and poked the yellow lumps. My appetite nowhere to be found. I managed two bites of toast before giving up, the crumbs catching in my throat. I moved the eggs around, pushing it to the side, into my napkin, getting it out of sight. Luckily, Stephen didn’t notice.

“I mean,” Stephen tried again, “Just imagine, we could be the ones to unravel the mystery,” his red face shined with hope, and bacon grease,

I looked at him, “You mean you,”

Stephen waved away my words, “I would credit you two.”

I sipped at my coffee, the hot liquid numbing the emptiness.

“And, you’re bringing John Joe because…?”

“Please. You’d think he’d pass up a chance to rough it on an island,” Stephen shook his head fondly,

“The lad thinks he’s Bear Grylls, he’d be pissed if I didn’t invite him.”

I had to nod; that made sense. When we were all in university, John Joe opted out of student accommodation, choosing to live out of a tent in the forest, emerging only for class, or a shower at one of our places.

“And me?” I clutched my mug tighter, “Why do you want me to come?”

Stephen went quiet, chewing his bottom lip. Then, he reached out and put his hand over mine on the table,

“I really want you to be there. I…I worry.”

The coffee turned bitter in my mouth. I don’t remember what happened after that as my mind went blank, but somehow, I ended up on a tiny boat, wedged in between my two friends, while being doused in sea spray.

I shivered, almost vibrated, where I sat, the layers and long johns I wore did nothing. Beside me, John Joe kept sniffing,

“Smell that sea air,” he breathed. It just smelled like fish to me.

“Nothing like it,” Stephen agreed, not looking up from his notebook,

“Works up an appetite.”

I sighed, the sound whipped away by the bitter wind. Our boatman, an elderly fisherman by the name of Martin, his snow-white hair hidden under a *Guinness* beanie. He was reluctant to bring us over, until Stephen pushed a wad of notes into his hands. Even so, the man grumbled under his breath the entire time. The other two didn’t notice, or care. I shivered at the brow of the boat, deciding that I better join in the conversation.

“So, what are we going to do when we get there?”

“I’ll be setting up camp, catching dinner, getting a lay of the land,” John Joe happily said, my stomach twinged at what he considered dinner.

“I will be doing a survey of the land, catalogue anything interesting, and find places to dig,” Stephen said, finally looking up from his notebook,

“Are you going to do a dig this weekend?”

“No, if I find anything interesting, I’d have to inform my professor and she’d have to get a permit, then organise a team.”

I interrupted him, “Surely, anything interesting would’ve been found years ago,”

“Not according to my research,” he flipped through his novel sized notebook, “In the history of Achill, I found that hardly any archaeological surveys have been conducted on this island.”

“Why though?”

Stephen hummed in thought, “Superstition I suppose, you know how the older generation are,” he glanced at over his shoulder at the boatman, still grumbling under his breath,

“When I was younger, my dad knocked a fairy tree down by accident, and I still remember my granny falling to her knees,” his eyes got a faraway look,

“The screams of her.”

John Joe sucked in air through his teeth,

“Ooh, I don’t know, I wouldn’t mess with a fairy tree either,”

Stephen scoffed, “Don’t tell me you believe in that nonsense?”

John Joe made a guttural noise before spitting over the boat, followed by the boatman,

“Stop it! I’m serious.”

“John Joe, come on, you’re almost 30, and you still believe in that fairy shite,”

John Joe crossed his arms, “What happened to your dad after the tree incident?”

“Oh, he died.”

John Joe gestured with his hands,

“He died from a heart attack,” Stephen corrected, “The man ate like shit.”

“And he was only struck dead after knocking down a fairy tree? Yeah, that’s a coincidence,” John Joe replied dryly,

Stephen tutted, turning to me,

“What do you think, Niall? Are you on my side, or the fool’s side?”

I sighed, “I think you’re both fools,”

Stephen pushed it, “Who’s the bigger fool?”

“Me, for coming on this trip.”

The pair burst into laughter, and I couldn’t help smiling myself. I had to admit; it was nice being with the boys again. Back in our uni days, they were, and still are, my best friends. I was too pessimistic for others, which Stephen and John Joe delighted in telling me so.

Another plus, they never questioned why I didn’t eat in the canteen.

Behind us, the boatman cleared his throat, speaking in a low, growling voice,

“God rest the poor souls,” he even crossed himself.

I thought he meant us until the island came into view, the craggy rocks rose out of the sea like the hunched spine of a hidden beast, puling us in. Then, I saw the cottages. Grey, little matchbox things that dotted the land. John Joe whistled his amazement, Stephen finally snapped his notebook shut to look, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the boatman. Upon nearing the shore, the boatman’s face hardened. As the boat cut through the waves, he kept crossing himself, muttering what I knew was a prayer. As we neared the shore, the boat slowed, the old man grunted a ‘leave,’ before turning the wheel. I got out first, unnerved by the man’s actions, and onto the wet sand. My feet slightly sank with a squish.

John Joe tossed out our bags, Stephen struggled to climb out while clutching his notebook, trying not to lose any pages. The boatman wearily watched us, making no move to help. The minute Stephen’s foot left the hull, the boat spun round. Sending up another burst of spray as it sped back towards the mainland. Stephen almost fell into the low tide, swearing as he did. All three of us watched as he quickly became a dot on the horizon. Our only way off the island, and it was gone. A cold stone of dread sat in my stomach,

“He does know to come back for us, right?” I asked Stephen,

“Yep,” he straightened himself up, checking all his pages were still there, “I paid him enough anyway.”

I tried not to focus on the pause in his voice.

I sighed; this was going to be a long weekend.

With our bags in tow, Stephen led the way over the beach, up onto the dirt path, trodden on and shaped by generations of farmers and animals. It felt strange following their footsteps, it almost felt like walking over a grave. John Joe marched on, his bag slung over his shoulder as his boots tramped forward. His bearded face lit up as he took in the scenery, breathing in the smell of nature. With his thick, luscious beard and flat cap, he looked like he was plucked from the island’s history, then he hummed the *DanDaDan* theme tune, ruining the image.

I, on the other hand, was falling behind. We weren’t even at the steepest part yet. We still had a hill to crest. My bag hit my shin with every step; my nose itched at the smell of grass. My steps kicked up so much dirt I could taste it. I barely listened as Stephen pointed things out. The sea churned and frothed behind us, the waves drowned out whatever they were talking about. Stephen had to shout to be heard over the noise,

“See those ridges?” He asked as we reached a series of fields, even overgrown, the layer of grass couldn’t hide the shape of the ridges carved into the ground,

“Those were lazy beds, so named because all you had to do was plant the potato seed, turn the sods, apply some seaweed, then just stand back and watch it grow,” he smiled, smugly, waiting for our reaction,

I grunted out a “Yeah,” and carried on walking. John Joe was the only one matching Stephen’s energy, asking about local wildlife, pointing out wild mushrooms for a stew. He gasped, plucking purple berries from a needle-like bush,

“Juniper berries!” He exclaimed, popping one in his mouth,

“Come back to me when you turn it into gin,” I muttered.

The grey sky disappeared as the foliage grew denser above us. The twisted hawthorn trees burst from the ground; empty branches curled like claws. If I wasn’t careful I could lose an eye on a twig.

Finally, after what seemed like an age, we rounded the end of the hairpin turn, and there it was. Cairn village. Heralded by the low, crumbling walls that encompassed the place. Stephen informed us that a total of 100 cottages were abandoned. Cottage was a strong word. The hovels left behind were nothing like the pictures in Stephen’s history book. Square, stone dwellings, some reduced to rubble, some swallowed up by the earth. The thatched roofs had long since been swept away by the endless barrage of wind and rain. This was no village; this was a graveyard.

“Wow,” Stephen breathed, “We’re gazing at history,”

I hummed, whether in agreement or not, I don’t know. John Joe hurried over to the first dwelling, jumping over a thick hedgerow.

“We’ll sleep here tonight.”

“Why would you pick the only cottage with two walls?” I sighed, “It’s not even a cottage, it’s a corner of a cottage,”

John Joe waved away my words, “We’ll get a great view of the stars this way.” He was already pulling out his sleeping bag.

I sighed and looked away, just 20 feet away was a steep drop, overlooking the bay where we were dropped off. It looked like any other coastline, the water glittered like diamonds, I guess it was a nice sight. Stephen let out another breath, wiping his glasses on his sleeve.

“John Joe, I’ll help you set up camp, and Niall-,”

I looked up from checking my phone, no signal in case you were wondering,

“Can you take this?” he handed me a thing that looked like an old compass,

“Go up to the top of hill there and get a number for me,”

“A number?”

“Yeah, I want to know how far above sea level we are,”

The highest cliff, Moy Head, Stephen told me, wasn’t that far, but it was a steep walk. My legs burned at the prospect. I really didn’t want to, but a quick look at the tent rods John Joe was pulling out made my decision. I saluted Stephen and began my upward trek. The altimeter was what the weird little thing was called, it rattled as I walked. A steady rhythm matching my uneven footsteps. With every step that took me higher, the voices of my friends grew fainter. They were talking about me, I knew it.

The grass overtook the dirt under my feet, I struggled to trudge through the tangled grass, tripping over hidden rocks and roots. Despite my creeping exhaustion, I had to admit, it did feel humbling walking a path forgotten by time. It got my imagination flowing. What did happen to the people of Cairn village? My theory was that they all walked off the cliff like lemmings in some mass panic. I was fixing to do it next; my legs were killing me already. I glanced behind me, my friends were just dots, waving at me. I waved back. I heard the scuffs of footsteps on rocks; the wind carried the sound to me.  

Dotted throughout the pasture, I noticed dark patches, not buried cottages, they were bog pits. The bog cotton confirmed it. I better warn the other two, the last thing we want is someone sinking into a bog. The Irish equivalent of quicksand. My grandfather lost a friend that way. One minute they were playing, the next, grandad was alone, The last image he had of his friend was his frantic, waving arms as they slowly sank into the earth. Yeah, I better warn them.

As I neared the peak, the altimeter showed 625 metres, while looking down, I caught sight of something in my periphery. A dark red colour. It looked like a tumble weed, stuck between two massive rocks. The reason it caught my attention was that it was the only colour besides green and grey. As I stared at it, shivering in the breeze, I wasn’t watching where I was going and tripped. The altimeter fell from my hands with a clunk. I scrambled for it as I straightened up, the red bush gone, probably taken by the wind.

I shrugged, thinking nothing more of it. The altimeter was stuck at 625, hopefully that was right. I tripped over the thing again. Annoyed, I bent down, tearing up grass to find and throw away the offending rock.

It wasn’t a rock.

It was too smooth, too pale, and it grinned up at me. It was a human skull, embedded in the earth.",1,1767990710.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

“The dead woman in your trunk, Mr Morton.”

“Ah yes, well she died— a month or so ago”

“So that’s why you waited for weeks with her in your trunk” I was not impressed.

“Yes ma’am” he rummaged around for the usual white envelope “there’s an extra something in there for you as well”

“That’s never good” I say, ripping the paper and counting the money.  

“Well you see-“

“Ah!” A sharp pain stabbed my thumb, I dropped the cash “what the hell!”

He smiled nervously. “Why don’t you see what that was? It could be important, life changing even.” 

I sucked the blood on my finger and used my shoe to move the bills around until I found a small knife with strange symbols and a note attached.

1q8jazr,https://i.redd.it/qx765stavdcg1.jpeg,There Are Several Bodies in Dr. Morton's Trunk,"Mrs. Wiltson was weeks into advanced bodily decomposition when I found her. What was left of her face wore a frozen expression of fear and confusion, her head sat neatly atop her bare chest. As suspected, she was in Dr. Morton’s trunk— and with every strange occurrence, I called him, not police. 

“Oh hmm, how unfortunate” he spoke in the tone of a lenient manager “would you be a darling and, hmm— that might be too much trouble, is it? It looks rather bad that she’s in there, no?”

“It looks horrible, sir” I had a staring contest with her empty eyes

“My spare keys should be under her neck, won’t you draw the sheet back over her and bring her around to my office? I’ll be down in a moment to meet you outside.”

“Sir?-“

“Is 2000 enough?”

Body or not, this car was going around the block for two grand. I lit a cigarette and climbed into the driver’s seat.

“I’ll be there shortly”

“Thanks dear, you really are special” he hung up

I drove the car from its usual dingy parking lot, permanently pockmarked with puddles and litter. The minivan bounced through a pothole and I heard, what I assumed to be Mrs. Wiltson's head, topple under the sheet. I tried to ignore it and turned up the music— taking a long drag on my cigarette. 

One last semester. 

I pulled onto the main road and headed toward the college. 

Once parked, I sprayed a bottle's worth of air freshener in the car, and stepped out face first into the large chest of Dr Morton. Surprised, I fell back into the door. 

“Oh my goodness Alice, are you alright?” He asked extending a hand “I’m terribly sorry I’ve startled you” 

“No” I stood upright on my own.

“You’re a terribly dainty little thing, won’t you eat a little more”

“I can’t afford it,” I said dryly.

He smiled “Well, come into my office, I’m sure you’re wanting some coffee”

I’d prefer a drink. “Sure”

Neither lights nor thermostat worked in his old building, only faint sunlight crept slowly through dusty windows— ghostly illumination for empty hallways. Once in his study, he began brewing a hot coffee. 

“That was Mrs. Wiltson wasn’t it?” I said, closing the door.

“Who?” 

“The dead woman in your trunk, Mr Morton.”

“Ah yes, well she died— a month or so ago”

“I saw, she’s decomposing”

“I figured I’d keep her for an autopsy, you know, see what happened, maybe fix her.”

“So that’s why you waited for weeks with her in your trunk” I was not impressed.

“Precisely, I needed-“

“There’s 2,000 for me?” I said, not wanting to hear a new ramble.

“Yes ma’am” he rummaged around for the usual white envelope “there’s an extra something in there for you as well”

“That’s never good” I say, ripping the paper and counting the money.  

“Well you see-“

“Ah!” A sharp pain stabbed my thumb, I dropped the cash “what the hell!”

He smiled nervously. “Why don’t you see what that was? It could be important, life changing even.” 

I sucked the blood on my finger and used my shoe to move the bills around until I found a small knife with strange symbols and a note attached. 

There is a way to bring her back, won’t you help me?

“Mrs. Wiltson didn’t have to die, we can fix the first mistake I’ve made in my life” his voice held an unshaken confidence for the first time. 

I wanted to go home “how much?” 

This was the last time I was helping Mr Morton.

1q8j9yu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8j9yu,The Reality I Usually Keep Quiet.,"I rarely show this side of my life. My priority has always been to share light, aesthetics, and inspiration. I want to be a source of strength for others. But what actually happens behind the scenes of my work and my ""smiling"" content?

Today, I want to show you a different reality. I live in two worlds: by day, I work, create, and dream; by night, I play a game of survival. This isn’t a Netflix script like Squid Game. This is life in Ukraine—a life that began in 2014 for some, and in 2022 for others, when the scale of war consumed every inch of my country.

When I say ""it was a difficult night,"" it’s not a metaphor. It’s the dry language of ballistics and weapon names we’ve learned to recognize by sound, without ever being soldiers. Everything imaginable is being hurled at us: Iskander and Kalibr missiles, supersonic Kinzhals that leave nowhere to hide. Today, it was an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) again. A weapon designed for global nuclear conflict is now hitting our cities. It is pure terror, meant to intimidate not just us, but the entire world. Endless swarms of drones—Gerans, Shaheds, and other ""mopeds""—circle overhead for hours, draining both our air defense and our psyche.

This is the testing of every existing type of weaponry on living people. While the world debates ""escalation,"" every night we become targets for experiments made of metal and explosives.

My Morning — January 9, 2026 (Which Is Actually Noon)
Today, I only fell asleep at 6:00 AM, once the sounds of the shelling finally faded. I woke up at 11:00 AM. I have zero resources to work, so I activate my ""recovery algorithm""—a routine perfected after every terrifying night:

Waking up: In itself, a reason to celebrate.

A cup of strong coffee: Though strictly forbidden by my doctors, it’s the only thing that ""switches on"" my brain after no sleep.

The ""Morning Cocktail"": Several glasses of water, strong painkillers for the headache, antidepressants, magnesium, and B vitamins to try and steady my nervous system.

An hour of silence: Just lying or sitting still, trying to recover while the echoes of explosions still ring in my head.

Basic magic: If there is water and power—a shower and a facial massage to reduce the swelling and look human again.

And then—work. Life goes on, and I must juggle my tasks with chronic stress. Outside, it’s -17°C. Kyiv is partially without power or heat. This is exactly what the enemy wants: darkness, cold, and suffering. This is a reality that millions of people around the world cannot even begin to imagine.

Why Am I Writing This?
Not for pity. I’m writing this to show that we are fighting. Even when we stand alone against a massive enemy, we continue to build our future. I want to inspire you not just through my art, but through resilience. The ability to drink your coffee, smile, and pull yourself together after acute stress—that is true strength.

A World Without Illusions
We must accept an unpleasant fact: this war has no quick end. The flywheel of a new global redistribution of resources and power has already been set in motion. Humanity has simply forgotten the horror of World War II, which claimed up to 85 million lives.

Today’s world leaders often view war through maps, ratings, and sanctions, not through the mud of a trench. Dictators do not understand the language of liberal arguments—they only recognize force. While democracies hesitate, autocracies act. The world will not return to ""how it was."" The old rules are shattered, and stability is now the exception.

My conclusion is simple: This is not a time for illusions. It is a time for endurance. History is cyclical and harsh—it does not spare the weak. So, we choose to be strong. Every single day. Despite everything.",2,1767990382.0,u_CynicOwl1,0,1.0,False

1q8j62u,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1q8j62u/at_least_one_interesting_thing_i_have_in_common/,At least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge,">*I sit outside at night looking at the  sky. I am away from the city: in the countryside, visiting my parents. I can see the stars. How glorious! My four-year old daughter V sleeps inside the house. Soon she will be my age, and the sky will stay the same, and I will be dead.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated August 12, 2025

- - -

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated July 29, 2025

- - -

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind. I held it until: V fell asleep, and somehow I fell asleep too.

I awoke to sunshine. “Daddy. Get up. It's day. It's daaaay!”

We brushed our teeth.

We ate.

The story was no longer there. I had written up to “‘Time,’ begins the professor—” and couldn't remember what was supposed to come after. All day I tried to figure it out, by re-reading what I had written, sitting in the leather chair in which I had written it, but it was no use. The idea had disappeared.

I had been writing a story based on a dream and was interrupted by an unexpected visitor, unable to ever finish what I'd started, which is at least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but whereas his man on business from Porlock was an unwelcome guest, my visitor was the most welcome in the world.

I am away from the city: in the countryside, visiting my parents. I can see the stars. How glorious! My four-year old daughter V sleeps inside the house. Soon she will be my age, and the sky will stay the same, and I will be dead.*

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind. I held it until: V fell asleep, and somehow I fell asleep too.

I awoke to sunshine. “Daddy. Get up. It's day. It's daaaay!”

We brushed our teeth.

We ate.

The story was no longer there. I had written up to “‘Time,’ begins the professor—” and couldn't remember what was supposed to come after. All day I tried to figure it out, by re-reading what I had written, sitting in the leather chair in which I had written it, but it was no use. The idea had disappeared.

I had been writing a story based on a dream and was interrupted by an unexpected visitor, unable to ever finish what I'd started, which is at least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but whereas his man on business from Porlock was an unwelcome guest, my visitor was the most welcome in the world.

I wonder if you'll ever read this, V.

If so: I love you.

(If not, I love you too!)

But it eats away at me, the story. The mystery. The knowledge that there was a solution, that the face drowned in space had come from somewhere, had been meant to mean something. All I know is what you've read and that I’d saved the file as *new-zork-origin-story.txt.*

1q8j5tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginFinancial/comments/1q8j5tn/megarequest_the_purchasing_power_engine_why/,"[Mega-Request] The ""Purchasing Power"" Engine: Why Origin should be the first platform to track Personal Inflation vs. Baseline","**Let’s be real:** A ""Budget"" in 2026 feels like a moving target.

We’ve all had that moment—standing in the grocery aisle, looking at a $200 receipt for three bags of food, and wondering: ""Is it me? Am I spending more, or is my money just worth less?""

Generic CPI (Consumer Price Index) data is useless. I don't care about the national average for used car prices if I'm trying to figure out why my weekly meal prep costs 30% more than it did in 2020 (or 2018, or 2022).

Origin has the data. It’s time to give us the Personal Purchasing Power Engine.

Here is the blueprint for the ultimate ""Smart Money"" feature set:

**1. The ""Time Machine"" Baseline (Total Flexibility)**

Don’t lock us into 2020. Give us a ""Set Baseline"" toggle. Let me pick any year or specific month in my history as the ""100%"" mark. I want to see my 2026 grocery bill indexed against my 2019 ""golden era"" spending.

**2. Personal Core PCE % (The ""Smart Person"" Metric)**

Economists track Core PCE to see the truth behind the noise. Origin should calculate our Personal Core PCE. By stripping out one-time anomalies (like a vacation or a new laptop), show us the raw percentage increase in our recurring cost of living. If my Personal PCE is 7% but my raise was 3%, Origin should tell me: ""You are effectively earning 4% less than last year.""

**3. The ""Shrinkflation"" Manual Adjustment**

This is the rockstar feature: Let us tag specific recurring items. If my favorite coffee brand stayed at $12 but dropped from 16oz to 12oz, let me ""weight"" that category. It’s the ultimate tool for the hyper-conscious budgeter to see the true cost of goods.

**4. Lifestyle Creep vs. Market Inflation (The Reality Check)**

This is the feature that saves marriages. Use a ""Heat Map"" to show:

Market Force: ""Your grocery bill is up 12% because prices rose.""

Behavioral Force: ""Your grocery bill is up an additional 10% because you’re buying more organic/premium items.""

Outcome: Now I know if I need to find a cheaper store or just stop buying expensive steak.

**5. ""Future-Proof"" Projection**

Based on my personal inflation trend over the last 3 years, project what my current lifestyle will cost in 2030. It’s a wake-up call for retirement planning that no other app provides.

Origin Team: Give us the ""Personal Inflation Dashboard"" and you won’t just have customers—you’ll have a cult following.

I went to her city and we were suppose to meet and talk about our intentions. I think she was waiting for me to talk to talk to her but we could only meet for coffee 2 times and I was hoping for us to take a meal or at least have a few more hours together. But we couldn’t. When I returned home I felt her being a bit cold. 

 She then explained that she didn’t feel I was serious and mature enough because I couldn’t articulate what I wanted even thought the “dates” went well and we had a lot of fun. 

I tried to explain that I was hoping for us to have a bit more longer time together. That we could eat, but we only had coffee twice. And then she had some errands to run. 

We message a bit back and forth. She said she did feel positive emotions when we met. But then I got blocked when I asked if we could meet again and talk or if I could call her.
