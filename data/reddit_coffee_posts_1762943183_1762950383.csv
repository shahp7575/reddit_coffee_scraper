I am not looking for a relationship on here. Im from the east coast of USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for any type of chats. Hopefully, it will be more long-term but also down for short-term chats too. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. Not looking for a relationship ",1,1762949749.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1ov3jxc,https://best-choice.shop/?p=456,What is the best Cuisinart single cup coffee maker for fresh and customizable brews?,"The link above leads you to a helpful page that walks through a curated list of top rated Cuisinart single cup brewers chosen by the site’s team. 

The page breaks down what makes each model stand out, whether someone values convenience, strong performance, or customization features like brew strength and temperature control. 

If you are trying to upgrade your morning routine with a reliable coffee maker that consistently delivers fresh flavor without taking up much space, this guide offers a great starting point.

To make the list even more useful, I would love to hear real user experiences and opinions. When choosing a single cup coffee maker, what matters most to you

• Do you prefer machines that work with pods, ground coffee, or both

• How important is adjustable brew strength or temperature settings

• Do you look for compact size or extra features like a reusable filter

Your insights can help refine the guide so that future readers make even better decisions.",1,1762949709.0,BuySmartHQ,0,1.0,False

Things became real very fast. There are feelings that we both try to control as it may be 'too soon'. Uncertainties and distance made it very overwhelming for him. I didn't see it coming. He ended whatever it is that we have and it crushed me. I just wanted to give it a try, is it wrong to give things a try?

President Trump, in an interview on Fox News’ *The Ingraham Angle* broadcast on the 11th, responded to a question about whether skilled worker visas would be reduced due to concerns over lowering wages for American workers by saying, “I agree with those concerns,” but added, “We also need to bring in talent.”

When the host pointed out that “there are many talented workers in the U.S.,” President Trump said, “Certain talents are not available to you. People have to learn them,” and added, “You can’t take people receiving unemployment benefits and put them to work in a missile factory. Talent must be brought in.”

President Trump specifically cited the Georgia incident, stating, “There were Koreans there who had been making batteries their entire lives. Making batteries is very complex and not easy. It’s highly dangerous, with frequent explosions and many problems.”

He continued, “They planned to bring in about 500 to 600 people in the initial phase to make batteries and teach others how to do it. But they tried to deport them,” and turned to the host, saying, “You would need such people too.”

President Trump also mentioned the Georgia incident during a meeting with reporters on Air Force One en route to Japan last month, saying, “Don’t you know how I feel? I strongly opposed this crackdown,” and added, “They are people who make incredibly complex semiconductors and computers. You can’t take unemployed people who haven’t worked for five years and put them to work.”

Meanwhile, in response to Democratic Party criticism over high inflation, President Trump rebutted, “We are doing amazingly well. It’s the best economy we’ve ever had,” and said, “Our costs are much lower now than under the previous Biden administration.”

However, he acknowledged, “Beef and coffee are a bit expensive,” and added, “We will lower some coffee tariffs.”",16,1762948033.0,neoliberal,6,1.0,False

Last week he invited me for coffee and we chatted for a while, it was less than 30-40 minutes, but it was good. Yesterday, on my initiative, I told him to go to the same cafeteria as last week to have a “quick coffee” and then everyone could continue with their work. We spent about 1 hour and 30 chatting, laughing and sharing tastes and hobbies. At first, upon meeting us, he was afraid of meeting me because he didn't know how to express himself fluently in Spanish. I told him that nothing was wrong, that I would teach him and help him. Yesterday, we were able to speak practically without problems, alternating between English and Spanish, and he was the most comfortable in the world.

Either they are too acidic, bitter, strong, or bland. Share your favorite recipes. The more interesting and unusual, the better. Here’s some of mine.
1. Banana Date - Blend 1/2 ripe banana and one Medjool Date with 1/2 c milk until smooth.
2. Cardamon Vanilla - Make a simple syrup of 5 cardamon pods and 1 vanilla pod. Boil with 1/2 c sugar and 1/4 water. Let steep overnight for stronger taste. Discard solids. Use 1-2 tbsp.
3. Peppermint Mocha - Add 1 tsp cocoa powder and a few drops of peppermint extract.
4. Biscoff - Mix 1 tsp chai latte mix and 1/4 tsp cinnamon with 1 pump caramel and 1 pump brown sugar cinnamon syrup. Use oat milk.
5. Honey Cinnamon Oatmeal Cookie- 1 tsp honey, 1 tsp chai latte mix, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 pump vanilla. Use oat milk.
I found oat milk makes coffee recipes that are like baked goods taste better. Probably because most have sugar in them. I used Kirkland Oat Milk brand.

Trump said, “I think this: We are doing phenomenally well. This is the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Their talking points, oh, of course, the costs are high, by the way, the only thing is beef.”

Host Laura Ingraham cut in to say, “Coffee.”

Trump responded, “Beef is a little high because the ranchers are doing great. Coffee, we’re going to lower some tariffs. We’re going to have some coffee come in. We’re going to take care of all this stuff very quickly, very easily. It’s surgical, it’s beautiful to watch. But our costs are way lower.”",1,1762947867.0,UsaNewsLive,1,1.0,False

Brent knew that pancakes weren’t exactly the healthiest food to have for breakfast, but you only live once, and it might as well be with sugary sweets. He baked a variety of pancakes and prepared various toppings. 

Brent enlisted the help of griffin Astro to take the food to the pavilion. The griffin flew back and forth, carrying baskets with food in its beak. The counselor laid out the foods and drinks on the table before plopping down at the Oneiroi cabin together with his pet and a plate stacked with pancakes. 

*The food*

* A variety of pancakes, including regular ones, gluten-free, or whole-grain. There are pancakes with bacon and ones with apple.
* A variety of toppings, including Nutella, chocolate sprinkles, fresh berries, maple syrup, and cinnamon sugar
* If someone isn’t into pancakes for breakfast, they can choose between a couple of cereals and sandwiches

I don’t know much about what I should look for except the basic things.

Does coffee from an espresso machine taste that much different than instant? I add milk and sugar to mine and I like a mix of bitterness and sweetness. I don’t buy coffee from cafes much since they’re super expensive here, and the one time I did try it, it a strong burnt taste so I've been avoiding it since then.

Now I have done some research, checked out Brivelle but there were so many options, Barista Pro Plus, Barista express, Bambino Plus etc. so I'm kinda lost now. Is there anything they do differently to choose one over the other? Are there any problems with machines that I need to look out for or be careful of and any brands or things I should avoid.

P.S : I saw that the grinder and machine can come separately as well as together in the machine so which one is better? Or is there any difference at all?

the sun would have risen slower
as if afraid to wake the fragile peace between us.
The morning would have carried your voice in its light
and the air would taste like laughter half remembered.
I would have kissed the sleep from your eyes
and learned the language your silence spoke.

If we had stayed
the walls would hum your name every night
and the shadows would dance to the rhythm of our breath.
Our hearts would have learned how to rest
without fear of breaking in the dark.
Rain would fall softly against the windows
not as mourning but as mercy.

We would have built small worlds out of ordinary moments.
You stirring your tea while I hummed out of tune,
our laughter rising like smoke from something burning but beautiful.
You brushing your teeth while I brushed my hair,
love growing quietly in the corners of our routine.
You would smile when you caught me staring
and I would finally believe I was home.

If we had stayed
I would have held your pain like a fragile glass bird,
careful not to crush it, gentle enough to let it heal.
I would have loved your anger until it forgot its name,
and let kindness be the only language between us.
You would have called me yours
and I would have finally known what forever felt like.

But we didn’t.
Now the sun rises too fast and too bright
and every shadow reminds me of what I lost.
The coffee goes cold before I can drink it
because your absence tastes bitter in every cup.
I walk through the day with your memory pressed against my ribs,
a bruise that doesn’t fade but keeps me alive.

If we had stayed
I would have loved you with hands steady from faith not fear.
I would have written your name in every quiet morning
and built a home from the pieces of the girl who always ran.
But time was cruel and I was weaker than I believed.
I let the moment slip through my trembling fingers
and you disappeared like breath in winter air.

Now every dream feels like punishment.
I see you smiling somewhere I can’t reach
and I wake up with your name bleeding through my teeth.
If we had stayed
the moon would have had something to envy
because even the stars would have burned a little softer for us.

Maybe in another world
you still wait for me in a room filled with sunlight.
Maybe I still find you and we start again,
unafraid, unchanged, unbroken.
But here, in this world, I am the echo of your laughter
and the ghost of the love I never learned to hold.
If we had stayed
I would have been your peace instead of your pain.
But I left too soon,
and now forever sounds like your name.

I was pretty skeptical… but curious enough to try them myself. So I downloaded a bunch of **real money gaming apps** to see which ones actually pay out.

After testing them for a few months, here’s what I found: some **do** pay real cash with **instant payouts**, but they’re only good for a bit of extra cash, not a real income.

So instead of wasting time on the fake ones, I’ve put together a breakdown of the legit options — how payouts work, which games are worth trying, and what to avoid if you actually want to earn something back. 

**By the way** – if you actually want something real that works online, this is what I personally recommend after 15+ years of testing everything:  
👉 [**See my No.1 recommendation here**](https://marksinsights.com/t37e)

# Quick reality check (read this before you download anything)

* **Side cash only.** Think coffee money, not rent money. If you want a *real* income, you’ll need a real business (I’ll link what I recommend at the end).
* **Skill beats luck.** The best earners are usually **skill-based tournaments** (solitaire, bingo, pool, word/puzzle). If there’s no skill, your edge is tiny.
* **Payouts can be instant… once you hit the threshold.** Many apps pay via **PayPal/Apple Pay/Bank**—“instant” often means same-day after you request.
* **Geo/legal stuff matters.** Some cash tournaments aren’t available in certain U.S. states due to skill-gaming rules. Apps usually list restricted states in their FAQs.
* **Don’t chase losses.** Set a weekly budget. If an app requires entry fees, treat it like entertainment with upside.

[**Here is what I recommend**](https://marksinsights.com/t37e)

# How “instant” payouts actually work

* **PayPal / Apple Pay / bank transfer:** Most skill apps use these. You’ll typically need to verify your account and hit a **minimum cash-out** (anywhere from $0.20 to $10+ depending on the app).
* **Gift cards:** GPT (“get-paid-to”) platforms often let you cash out **faster** with gift cards than cash.
* **“Instant” ≠ automatic.** You still need to **tap withdraw**—some apps batch payments, others are near-instant.

# The landscape: two ways to earn

# 1) Skill-based cash tournaments (higher upside, small buy-ins)

Good if you enjoy competing and can improve over time.

* **Bingo Cash** – Fast bingo with tournaments; pays to PayPal/bank. Restricted in some states.
* **Solitaire Cash** – Classic solitaire with head-to-heads. Not available everywhere.
* **Bubble Cash** – Aim, pop, score high; simple but surprisingly competitive.
* **21 Blitz** – Blackjack x Solitaire hybrid; rewarding if you like quick mental math.
* **Pool Payday** – Realistic pool physics; high skill ceiling.
* **Blackout Bingo** – Competitive bingo; smooth cashouts via PayPal/Apple Pay/bank.
* **Big Buck Hunter** – Arcade nostalgia; accuracy and speed decide winners.
* **Blitz Win Cash** – Hosts multiple mini-games with cash brackets.

>

# 2) GPT / reward apps (no buy-ins, lower ceiling, steady trickle)

Good if you want **zero risk** and don’t mind stacking small wins.

* **Freecash** – Lots of gaming offers; fast cashouts (PayPal, crypto, gift cards).
* **Kashkick** – U.S.-focused; games, surveys, app trials; pays to PayPal.
* **Scrambly** – Frequent game offers, very low cashout ($1 via PayPal).
* **Super.com** – Earn via games/surveys + savings/coupons; most features under **Super+**.
* **Cash Giraffe (Android)** – Constantly refreshed game list; cashouts from $0.20.
* **Mistplay (Android)** – Big catalog; gift cards start low, PayPal has a higher threshold.
* **Rewarded Play** – Puzzle/word games; low $5 minimum.
* **JustPlay** – **Frequent cashouts** (every \~3 hours) with no minimum.
* **Cashyy (Android)** – Low PayPal threshold ($0.20); solid for casuals.
* **Money Well (Android)** – Cashouts from $0.50; broad gift card options.
* **MyFreeApp** – Newer platform; many gaming offers; $1 PayPal minimum.
* **Lucktastic** – Scratchers/contests; free to play with occasional big prizes.

>

# My “use it smart” playbook

**1) Pick a lane (or mix both).**  
If you’re competitive, start with **2 skill apps** and **1 GPT app** for filler time. If you’re casual, run **3 GPT apps** and skip entry fees entirely.

**2) Practice for free, track win-rate.**  
Hit the free lobbies. If you’re not top 30–40% consistently, don’t jump into buy-ins yet. Record quick notes like: game, mode, score, rank.

**3) Bank the promos.**  
Welcome bonuses, referral rewards, streak multipliers, and seasonal tournaments can **2–3x** early earnings. Join when promos are live.

**4) Cash out often.**  
Don’t hoard balances inside apps. Withdraw whenever you hit the minimum—especially on newer platforms.

**5) Cap your spend.**  
If you play buy-ins, set a **weekly cap** (e.g., £10–£20/$10–$20). When it’s gone, you’re done for the week.

# Who this is (and isn’t) for

**Great for:**

* People who enjoy casual competition and want **pocket money**.
* Commuters, queue-sitters, and parents catching micro-breaks.
* Anyone who likes the dopamine hit of small, frequent wins.

**Not great for:**

* Anyone trying to replace a job. It won’t.
* People prone to chasing losses. Skill games with buy-ins can punish tilt.
* Those expecting passive income. This is **active** time-for-money.
* [**See my No.1 recommendation here**](https://marksinsights.com/t37e)

# The honest bottom line

Yes—**games that pay real money instantly** exist. Use them for **small, fast wins**, treat buy-ins like entertainment, rotate GPT apps to stack freebies, and withdraw early and often. If you want **actual income**, these won’t get you there. They’re fun side earners—**not** a business.

If your goal is to build something that compounds and pays you predictably, you’ll need a real, proven online model (client work, local lead gen, productized services, etc.). That’s a different game entirely.

# Curated list you can copy-paste and test

**Skill-based tournaments (test your edge):**  
Bingo Cash • Solitaire Cash • Bubble Cash • 21 Blitz • Pool Payday • Blackout Bingo • Big Buck Hunter • Blitz Win Cash

**Zero-risk GPT/rewards (stack small wins):**  
Freecash • Kashkick • Scrambly • Super.com • Cash Giraffe (Android) • Mistplay (Android) • Rewarded Play • JustPlay • Cashyy (Android) • Money Well (Android) • MyFreeApp • Lucktastic

Expert Advice from Burute Dental, Your Trusted Dentist in Pune","Getting a tooth extracted can be a bit scary, especially if you’re wondering about what comes next — like, **can I eat after a tooth extraction?** If you’ve searched for a ""Dentist near me"" or a Dentist in PCMC, you probably want clear answers without confusing medical jargon. Let’s break it down so you know exactly what to do and how to take care of your mouth after your visit to the dentist.

# What Happens When You Get a Tooth Extracted?

When a tooth is removed, your body starts healing right away. But the area where the tooth was pulled out is like a small wound. It needs time and proper care to heal without problems. Eating right after extraction might affect this healing process.

# Why Is Eating After Tooth Extraction a Big Deal?

Eating right after tooth extraction can be tricky because:

* **Your mouth is sore and sensitive.**
* **There’s a blood clot forming to help heal the spot.**
* **Certain foods can irritate the wound or get stuck.**

If you mess this up, you could get pain, infection, or something called ""dry socket,"" which is really uncomfortable.

# Burute Dental Explains: What You Should Know

Burute Dental is one of the most trusted [Dentist in Pune ](https://www.burutedental.in/)clinics. If you are looking for the best advice on dental care in Pune or nearby, Burute Dental always puts your health first. Their team understands how important it is to help you heal properly after a tooth extraction.

Dr. Burute and the team emphasize following simple rules after the procedure to avoid complications and help you get back to eating normally as soon as possible.

# Can I Eat After Tooth Extraction? Here’s the Real Answer!

**1. Wait Before Eating**

Right after your extraction, your mouth will be numb because of local anesthesia. Eating while numb can lead to biting your tongue or cheek by accident. So, wait until the numbness wears off before you try eating.

**2. Start With Soft Foods**

When you’re ready to eat, begin with soft foods that won’t irritate the wound. Think of:

* Yogurt
* Mashed potatoes
* Smoothies but no straws
* Scrambled eggs
* Soups not too hot

These foods are gentle on your healing gums and won’t disturb the blood clot.

**3. Avoid Hot, Spicy, or Crunchy Foods**

Hot foods or drinks can cause discomfort and slow healing. Spicy or crunchy foods can get stuck in the extraction site or cause irritation. So, avoid:

* Chips
* Nuts
* Spicy curries
* Hot coffee or tea

Stick to mild and cool or lukewarm foods.

**4. No Straws**

This is important: Using a straw creates suction in your mouth that can dislodge the blood clot. This can cause dry socket and delay healing. So, drink from a glass instead.

**5. Stay Hydrated**

Drink lots of water to keep yourself hydrated. But remember, no sucking motions like straws or vigorous rinsing.

**6. Chew on the Other Side**

If you have to eat solid foods after some days, try chewing on the side opposite to the extraction site. This protects the wound from irritation.

# How Long Should You Wait to Eat Normally?

Usually, after 24 hours, you can slowly start to eat more regular foods but continue to avoid anything too hard, sticky, or crunchy for about a week. Healing time varies, but following these guidelines helps your mouth recover faster and painlessly.

# Why Choose Burute Dental for Your Tooth Extraction in Pune?

# Quick Tips From Burute Dental After Tooth Extraction

* Avoid smoking or alcohol as they delay healing.
* Don’t rinse your mouth forcefully for the first 24 hours.
* Take prescribed pain medications as directed.
* Attend follow-up visits to check healing progress.

# When to Call Your Dentist?

If you notice heavy bleeding, severe pain, fever, or swelling that gets worse, call your dentist immediately. These can be signs of infection or other complications.

# Final Thoughts: Eating After a Tooth Extraction Made Easy

During the spillage the PC was plugged in, but turned off. I immediately unplugged both the PC and removed the GPU completely as soon as it happened.  
My questions are as follows:

* Should I be particularly concerned for my GPU in my case and which steps should I follow? 
* Should I just  let it dry for a day or two, or should I wipe it with Isopropanol alcohol? 
* If the latter, I currently only got 96% Isopropanol on my hand, is it okay if I use that or should I specifically buy 99,9% Isopropanol in order to be super safe?

Before that I was gaining weight, and my body felt/looked really swollen, but now this has definitely gotten better. However, what didn't improve are my brain fog, low energy and digestive issues (especially acid reflux) and bloating/constipation.  
  
Actually, I've been living with digestive issues and constipation since I was a child, which have only slightly improved after going lactose-free (I discovered a lactose intolerance 7 years ago). What has really changed in my digestive issues is that, before February, it was enough to take 20mg of PPI for a month or two twice a year, and I could actually feel better for a certain period of time. Instead, since February (when probably I already had my Hashimoto's without knowing it) I tried three different PPIs without any success. Just currently with 40mg of esomeprazole, I feel a bit better, but still, I always wake up with a weird taste in my mouth. I've already cut out from my diet coffee, tomatoes, yoghurt and other foods/drinks which tend to worsen acid reflux.  
  
I recently also did some blood exams to exclude autoimmune gastritis and celiac disease, which both seem to be negative. My gastroenterologist suggests going for a gastroscopy anyway, but my GP is really stubborn about that and is finding ANY excuse to not prescribe me one, which makes it impossible to do the exam through the public health system. This means that I should go privately, but it is really an expensive exam.

We were only together for 2.5 months, but the breakup lasted a very gruelling 7.5 hours. (From 9:30 a.m when I initiated it, to 5:00 p.m when I put her on the train home.)

I have trouble articulating my thought and feelings, I actively avoid conflict, and this was my first time ending a relationship, so needless to say it was a challenging experience.

My ex is a very sensitive girl and she said a lot of quite intense things during the breakup that solidified for me that this was the correct decision on my part (i.e. dropping an “I love you” for the first time mid-breakup, telling me she “never thought (she’d) go through a breakup again” because we would be together “forever,” and that she never thought she’d have to be independent again.)

I will admit I ended the breakup quite open ended, saying I wasn’t going to text her but she could text me if she wanted. I will admit I can be a bit of a pushover and didn’t want to seem to cruel, which is why I left the door open for her to contact me.

She texted me today telling me she wanted some of her belongings back and wanted to grab coffee next week because she’d “appreciate the chance to talk more calmly now that (she) actually know(s) what’s going on.” 

I offered to leave her belongings in a bag in the lobby of my apartment building for her to pick up, but told her I didn’t want to talk yet. She said “that hurts,” followed by “don’t you care about me? You broke my heart.”

I said that what she was saying wasn’t fair, and that I do care about her, but I didn’t want to see her yet.

Next time she asks, I’m going to close the door completely and tell her I don’t want to see her.

Am I being unfair by telling her I don’t want to see her again and denying her closure?

!! WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT !!

episode 1-2 start with the background story of liam white, the chief of police. a dear colleague of his has been kidnapped and no one has heard of her ever since. until liam gets a call that changes his life. until liam pulls the trigger and kills the most dangerous man in the prescott family.

five years after, episode 3-4 revolve around his sister, claire white. while she lives the perfect teenage life, the only thing she can worry about is her future career. little does she know that zane, a cold-hearted and murderous man, is following her every step. he waits three blocks back when she leaves the coffee shop, sits in his car until the lamplight washes the park bench where she reads, times the bus routes so he always knows which stop she'll use. 

liam killed someone dear to zane. now, his little sister, claire, is the key to vengeance. he has rehearsed her final reckoning in quiet places, rehearsed how he will make her understand the scale of what she cost him.

But in Mumbai, I went to the Nariman Point outlet, not exactly a small one, and the barista just said, “We only have the Silver Oak blend.”

The coffee honestly sucked. It didn’t even taste like Silver Oak, felt more like a light roast, super acidic and flat.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Los Angeles Lakers: A Clash of Titans (With a Few Missing Pieces)**

The Oklahoma City Thunder, fresh off a 11-1 start and riding a five-game home winning streak, host the Los Angeles Lakers in what could be a Western Conference Finals preview—assuming the Lakers’ roster isn’t just a fantasy draft pool. Let’s break this down with the precision of a NBA analyst and the humor of a Twitter thread after a 20-point loss.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Thunder Are the Obvious Choice (But Let’s Pretend It’s Not)

The Thunder enter as 6.5-point favorites, with moneyline odds hovering around **+137 for the Lakers** and **-137 for Oklahoma City** (per FanDuel). Using our trusty formulas:

* **Thunder’s implied probability**: 1 / 1.37 ≈ **73% chance to win**.
* **Lakers’ implied probability**: 100 / (325 + 100) ≈ **23.5% chance**.

Translation: The books think the Lakers have about the same chance of winning as a person attempting to parallel park a dump truck.

Statistically, the Thunder dominate. Their **104.1 defensive rating** is like a fortress guarded by a sleep-deprived dad—unyielding and slightly irritable. The Lakers, meanwhile, sport a **116.2 defensive rating**, which is “okay” if your definition of okay is “a sieve that’s had one too many cups of coffee.”

Offensively, the Thunder average **120.5 PPG**, while the Lakers, despite a league-best **51.2% FG%**, struggle to score consistently. It’s the difference between a well-tuned espresso machine and a coffee mug that’s seen better days.

---

### Injury Report: When Absences Become a Full-Time Job

Both teams are playing musical chairs with their lineups. The **Thunder** are missing **Jalen Williams** (wrist), **Nikola Topic** (groin), and **Kenrich Williams** (knee), while the **Lakers** are sans **LeBron James** (sciatica), **Gabe Vincent** (ankle), and **Adou Thiero** (knee).

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Edmonton Oilers vs. Philadelphia Flyers: A Tale of Two Teams Tripping Over Their Own Feet**

Let’s cut to the chase: This game is like watching two chefs burn the same soufflé. The **Edmonton Oilers** and **Philadelphia Flyers** are both struggling with slow starts, but only one team’s “slow start” will end in a comeback victory. Let’s parse the odds, news, and absurdity to find out who deserves your bets—and your sympathy.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The betting market gives the **Oilers slight edge** at decimal odds of **1.72 (implied probability: \~58%)**, while the Flyers are priced at **2.15 (implied: \~47%)**. The spread favors Edmonton by 1.5 goals, and totals are set at 6.0 goals (even for an NHL game, that’s a bloodbath in the making).

Why the Oilers? Recent form, star power, and a history of late-game heroics. The Flyers? Well, they’ve lost three straight at home and look like a team playing chess while their opponent plays checkers.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Coach Who Needs a Coach

**Edmonton’s** recent win over Columbus was a rollercoaster: McDavid conjured magic, Walman became the first Oilers player to score a shorthanded goal in 20 years, and Roslovic iced the game with an overtime backhand that would make a sushi chef weep. But don’t let that fool you—the Oilers are still a team that ranks **31st in save percentage** and **28th in shooting percentage**. They’re like a toaster that occasionally bursts into flames but somehow still toasts your bread.

Key injuries: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is out for a week (“undisclosed,” which in hockey speak means “we’re too embarrassed to explain”), and Zach Hyman, a former 54-goal scorer, might return soon. For now, they’re rolling with Jack Roslovic and Jake Walman as their “A-team.”

**Philadelphia**, meanwhile, is a team that’s been out-battled in the first period of two straight games. Captain Sean Couturier sounds like a man who’s been drinking lukewarm coffee for breakfast: “We’re not starting strong.” Coach Rick Tocchet took full responsibility, which is hockey lingo for “I’ll blame the Zamboni driver next.” Dan Vladar gets the nod in

So I’ve been on GLP-1 for a few weeks now , and I started noticing some interesting changes in my eating habits. My cravings are much lower, and my appetite feels way more under control. But what’s really surprising is that I don’t feel as drawn to my usual foods anymore. Instead, I find myself more into drinks, smoothies, coffee, shakes, hot chocolate, that kind of stuff.

At first, I didn’t think much of it, just assumed it was part of the process. But then I [read](https://www.pharmacyuk.com/eating-disorder-patients-found-using-weight-loss-injections-to-suppress-appetite/) something that made me pause and think: maybe this is a real effect of GLP-1, or maybe it’s just nudging me toward better food choices without me even realizing it.

I know plenty of people here have been on GLP-1 for a while, so I’m really curious ,how has it affected your food habits? Did it change what you enjoy eating or your cravings? Any thoughts on how it might relate to eating patterns or just overall appetite?

I am not overweight or chubby (I used to be) But i’m not particularly as lean as I want to be. 

I don’t want to hear any comments about telling me that I’m not eating enough etc because I’ve ruined my metabolism as a child anyway, so If I do eat more I would probably just gain more BF.

I train 6x a week weights, and after every weight session i do 25 min incline treadmill. I also get 10k+ steps a day and I horse ride.

I don’t eat much sugar, I eat pretty damn healthy.

I have a little stomach fat though and WHATEVER I do i can’t get rid of it.

I don’t binge eat either

Here’s what I eat in a day (pretty much the same thing everyday)

6:30am (Breakfast) : Bowl of mixed cut up fruit and a cup of coffee with a teaspoon of honey.

10:30/11am: Two apples with peanut butter and raisins and another coffee.

12pm: Another coffee (some days only if i’m tired)

3pm: sometimes i have a snack after gym like blueberries.

6:30pm: Something with meat and a salad (my parents are health freaks so it’s never fast food etc, i don’t eat fast food)
 
Sometimes I’ll have an ice cream or a chocolate after dinner maybe like 1/2x a week.

I eat like this EVERYDAY the same thing.

rank the best coffee makers","at some point between my third caffeine crash and my 20th brew, i realized best coffee maker
lists online all sound the same. they talk specs, not experience like yeah, great flow rate, but
does it actually make mornings better?
so i went down the rabbit hole myself. a mix of drip, espresso, and all-in-one brewers later,
here’s how i’d rank the ones that stood out not just on taste, but on usability, cleanup, and how
often i actually wanted to use them.
consider this my caffeine-fueled public service.
1. Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV Select the benchmark. it’s so well-built it almost dares you to find fault. brews at a consistent
196–205°F, dead-on every time, which is basically coffee science perfection.
the cup it makes? bright, balanced, clean the kind of clarity you notice when you switch back to
anything cheaper.
the hype: people call it the forever machine because it literally lasts decades and yeah, the
build quality is ridiculous.
the critique: zero forgiveness. use meh beans or mess up your grind and it’ll taste flat. this
thing exposes mediocrity.
* if you’re the type who buys good beans and enjoys control, this is the top of the list. if not, it’ll
feel too honest.
2. Breville Precision Brewer Thermal feels less like a coffee maker, more like a lab tool. you can adjust pre-infusion, water temp, flow
rate all the stuff that normally requires a gooseneck kettle and a scale.
the gold mode nails SCA standards automatically, but the manual options are where it shines.
the hype: you can dial in a cup like a barista. true. it lets you experiment endlessly.
the critique: definitely not beginner-friendly. if your morning brain isn’t awake enough to
remember which button you pressed, you’ll get inconsistent brews.
* worth it if you actually enjoy the process and want cafe-level precision at home. otherwise, a
simpler machine will make you happier.
3. Gaggia Classic Evo Pro the espresso classic heavy, tactile, and somehow makes you feel like you’re running your own
micro café. when dialed in, it pulls a creamy, balanced shot that tastes like a $5 latte without the
latte.
the hype: best entry-level espresso machine. 100%. it’s the gateway drug for every espresso
nerd.
the critique: maintenance fatigue is real, cleaning, descaling, purging. you can’t skip steps or
it’ll punish you with bitter shots.
* it’s amazing for people who want to learn espresso, not just drink it.
4. OXO Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker the one that surprised me most. looks simple, almost too minimal but the thermal carafe keeps
things hot without burning, and the bloom cycle evenly saturates grounds for surprisingly
balanced flavor.
the hype: the quiet overachiever. agreed.
the critique: small annoyances like the short cord and limited capacity not dealbreakers, but
you’ll notice them.
* it’s the brewer I ended up using the most because it’s low effort, consistent, and never lets me
down before work.
5. Ninja CM401 Specialty Coffee Maker the does-it-all option. it makes iced coffee, cold brew, concentrated shots basically, if there’s a
coffee style, it can mimic it. it’s fun and flexible, especially if multiple people in your house have
different coffee personalities.
the hype: one machine for every mood. true, and it’s intuitive.
the critique: the flavor doesn’t quite match the single-purpose machines it’s good, not
mind-blowing.
* great for variety lovers or families; not for purists chasing the perfect extraction.
what i learned (besides how fast caffeine tolerance builds)
* there’s no single best coffee maker, there’s just the one that matches your patience level. * temp stability > fancy features. every good cup started with steady heat.
* if you splurge on anything, make it the beans, not the machine. even a $100 brewer can taste
amazing with fresh coffee.

1ov1rcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ov1rcu/every_job_ive_tried_activated_flight_mode_i_avoid/,Every job I've tried activated flight mode. I avoid showing up. What can I do to change that?,"I am 22 and had to work since 18. My first job was a shitty kitchen one, so I'm not surprised I wanted out.

But then I kept repeating the same behaviours, no matter the conditions. I would avoid showing up, wouldn't answer calls, messages, wouldn't touch my tasks, I would keep coming up with excuses (e.g. hospital, family issues). On days where I'd manage to show up it would be so hard to focus and do anything productive that I would just pretend to be working. I would zone out, dissociate even, my internal dialogue would become full of self-hatred. I even started harming my body in my previous job. There were only a few days where I could accomplish something.

Right now, I have a good office job, I am a Data Analyst Intern at a big well-known company. Which is great, it's a job that is hard to get and somehow, I've had the luck to land it twice (the previous one fired me). I tried every technique under the sun, I've promised myself so many times I'll change. To-do lists, pomodoro, yoga, meditation before work, tough love approach, energetic music, coffee, remote work, stationary work. 

I feel hopeless, lazy, tired and suicidal to be honest. I feel like a loser and a failure.

I am unable to stop working, I have to do it to support myself. I also have university which is an incredibly overwhelming combination.

What can I do? Should I change field to something easier and less straining on the brain? How do I not run away and show up when my brain is screaming at me all the time? ",1,1762943696.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

* I always have very light roast coffees from either Tim Wendelboe, DAK, Nomad or Mame, the coffee profile is mostly Kenya-like, red/pink bourbon, almost always washed
* however, about 1/4 of the coffees are a bit more round/chocolatey (Pacas or colombian coffees, usually with advanced fermentation techniques, an excellent example would be: https://www.dakcoffeeroasters.com/shop/coffee/milky-cake)
* I would thus like a grinder that works for both profiles above (even though more tailored to the first)
* Ideally I would like no plastic parts
* I would often travel with it and I like to travel light. When travelling, I often use aeropress instead of v60
* Ideally I would like to keep it under 200$

My ideas were either to go for something basic such as a timemore c3s pro but I have seen a lot of hype around 1zpresso zp6 (which I sense would nail the coffee profiles that I like) and also very positive comments about the kingrinder k6 (or potentially the new k7).

# 🌏 Before the First Brew

For centuries, China was the world’s only exporter of tea.  
From there, tea culture spread to Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, and Southeast Asia, while Middle Eastern traders carried it westward overland.

Europe only encountered tea in the 17th century, when Dutch and British merchants began importing it via ocean routes — turning tea into a global phenomenon.

By the late 18th century, the British East India Company dominated global trade but faced a growing crisis:  
China, the sole supplier of tea, demanded payment in silver instead of barter goods.  
Political tensions and economic pressure forced the British to look for new regions to grow tea themselves — and India became their answer.

In 1774, a shipload of Chinese tea seeds arrived in Calcutta, where experimental planting began.  
Later, at the suggestion of botanist Sir Joseph Banks, the East India Company tested plantations across India between the 26th and 30th parallels of latitude.  
The first serious effort began in 1793, when Colonel Robert Kyd established experimental plots at Sibpur, Calcutta.

But these early experiments struggled.  
The real breakthrough came not from imported Chinese seeds — but from something growing wild in India’s own jungles.

# 🌄 The Jungle Discovery (1823–1824)

India’s chai story truly began deep in the forests of Upper Assam.

In 1823, a Scottish trader named Robert Bruce heard rumors from Maniram Dutta Baruah (later Maniram Dewan), an Assamese nobleman, about a local tribe that drank tea from wild plants.  
Bruce met Beesa Gam, a chief of the Singpho tribe, who had long been cultivating and brewing a fermented tea called phalap.

Bruce obtained seeds and samples, sending them to the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, where botanists confirmed a groundbreaking fact:  
this was a distinct variety — Camellia sinensis var. assamica, native to India.

Sadly, Robert Bruce died soon after, but his brother Charles Alexander Bruce took over the mission, working with Maniram Dewan and local communities to begin systematic cultivation.  
This discovery didn’t just reshape India’s economy — it changed global tea history.

Maniram Dewan later became one of India’s first indigenous tea planters and was executed in 1858 for supporting the 1857 uprising — remembered as Assam’s first freedom martyr.

Fun fact: Assam, India’s tea heartland, has officially made tea its State Drink. 🍃

# 🏛️ The British Tea Empire (1830s–1850s)

The East India Company quickly saw profit in Assam’s wild leaves.

* 1834: A Tea Committee was formed to promote tea cultivation.
* 1837: The first experimental garden was planted at Chabua, Upper Assam.
* 1838: The first Indian tea consignment from Assam was shipped to London for public sale — and it was a hit.
* 1839: The Assam Company, the world’s first tea company, was founded.

That first auction shattered China’s centuries-old monopoly and launched India into the global tea trade.

When Chinese seedlings failed in Assam’s humid climate, the native Assam variety thrived, giving India a biological and commercial edge.

By 1863, plantations had spread beyond Assam to Kumaon, DehraDun, Garhwal, Kangra Valley, and Kulu — forming India’s now-iconic tea-growing belt.

But this success had a dark side.  
Tens of thousands of labourers were recruited from central and eastern India under indentured contracts, and the Workmen’s Breach of Contract Act (1859) made it a crime to leave plantations early.  
The system was harsh and exploitative — a grim underside to the Empire’s “tea success.”

In 1881, the Indian Tea Association was founded to standardize quality, regulate labour, and promote Indian-grown tea — a crucial step in shaping the modern tea industry.

# 🚂 Tea and the Railways (1900s–1930s)

As railways spread across India, so did chai.

At every station, vendors sold hot, milky tea in kullads — small clay cups that added an earthy aroma and could be smashed after use.

Unlike British tea, which was steeped, Indians boiled everything together — tea leaves, milk, sugar, and spices like ginger, cardamom, and cloves.  
This created masala chai — strong, aromatic, and uniquely Indian.

Across regions, local variations evolved:  
Adrak chai (ginger tea) in the north, kadak chai (extra-strong tea) in Maharashtra, Sulaimani tea in Kerala, and noon chai (salted pink tea) in Kashmir.

In 1936, the Indian Tea Market Expansion Board began promoting tea stalls and educating the public on brewing techniques — transforming tea into a daily ritual.

# 🫖 When the Empire Left, the Tea Stayed (Post-1947)

After Independence, the British left — but chai stayed behind.

India soon became the second-largest tea producer in the world, after China, and today consumes nearly 30% of global output.

In 1947, most tea was exported abroad.  
By the 2000s, over 70% was enjoyed domestically.

A major factor was technology:  
the CTC process (Crush, Tear, Curl) — invented in the 1930s and popularized after the 1950s — made tea cheaper, stronger, and ideal for boiling with milk and spices.

Chai became the drink of the people — from factory floors to university canteens.

# ☕ The Rise of the Tapri (Roadside Tea Stall)

By the 1960s and ’70s, the tapri — small roadside tea stall — had become India’s social equalizer.

Over countless cups, strangers became friends, and debates turned into memories.  
Workers shared grievances, students shared dreams, and artists found inspiration — all over steaming glasses of chai.

In Mumbai, the fast-paced lifestyle gave rise to cutting chai — a small, strong half-cup for quick refreshment.  
Half the size, twice the kick.

# 📊 How Chai Conquered a Nation

|1947|252 million kg|51 million kg|201 million kg|\~20%|\~80%|

|2024|1,382 million kg|\~1,128 million kg|254 million kg|\~82%|\~18%|

India now drinks over 1.2 billion kilograms of tea every year — about 15 times more tea than coffee.  
From luxury to necessity, chai became the heartbeat of daily Indian life.

# 🌍 The Legacy

From Chinese dynasties to Assam jungles…  
From colonial plantations to Mumbai’s tapris…

Each cup tells the story of India —  
discovery, exploitation, adaptation, and identity.

# ☕ Did You Know? (Fun Facts Box)

* India is the world’s largest tea consumer, drinking nearly 30% of all global tea every year.
* Assam and Darjeeling teas are globally recognized — Assam for its malty strength, Darjeeling for its delicate aroma.
* Masala chai isn’t a fixed recipe — every region (and every household) tweaks the spice mix differently.
* The word chai comes from the Mandarin “cha”, spread through Persian and Hindi.
* India drinks 15× more tea than coffee.

TL;DR:  
India discovered its own tea in 1823, broke China’s monopoly in 1839, endured colonial exploitation, reinvented tea with milk and spices, and made chai the symbol of its soul. 🇮🇳☕
