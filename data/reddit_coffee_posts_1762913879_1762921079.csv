What i've noticed is that I feel absolutely nothing different. I am the same easily distracted inattentive me. Given I am not as sleepy or I do have more energy despite not drinking any coffee. 

Was wondering, if I should give this more time to work or should I discuss increasing the dosage with my doctor? 

I need the medication solely for focus. I need to be able to lock in at work without feeling zoned out after a while and daydreaming. I have tried removing all the distractions however I am still ending up staring at my screen daydreaming. 

Edit: I am asking cause my appointment is expensive and would really like other perspectives before spending money to get my meds adjusted before I have really given it a chance and also it's my first time on vyvanse. ",2,1762919872.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

I’ve been told that I can just have people come over and have a coffee (I’m kind of isolated lol), but I’m not sure if you can request things like that as I’m not deaf or HOH but I would like to learn for a friend.

1ouuwra,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1ouuwra/3_nights_in_honolulu_at_queen_kapiolani_hotel/,3 nights in Honolulu at Queen Kapi'olani Hotel,"Stayed 3 nights at the QK and did most of the required sights in HNL. Hotel was booked through Costco travel and included breakfast and a discounted valet parking. We were “upgraded” to a larger room at checkin. Every staff member we encountered throughout our stay was amazing. Room was spacious, bathroom was adequate. Room had robes, small fridge and a Keurig style coffee maker. Room could use some updating but otherwise was just fine.  Breakfast was at The Deck restaurant on the 3rd floor. The restaurant was great! Staff were very friendly and breakfast was perfect! We had some other things there too and thoroughly enjoyed it. Also hotel has beach chairs and towels which are self serve and we really appreciated having them. The valet is very busy in the morning. Expect a 20-30 minute wait. Location is pretty walkable to most things.

Some comments about other things we did

**Climbed Diamond Head**. We had a resy for 10 am (earliest I could get). We showed up at 9. The attendant almost didn’t let us in but made us promise to be out in 2 hours. We were up and back in 90 minutes.

**Honolua Bay** for snorkeling

Made that resy at 7 am 2 days before for 11:30 and it was definitely worth it. Get there at least half an hour before your time. We rented snorkeling equipment from them and loved it! 

**Pearl Harbor**

Make an early reservation! Get there an hour before and rent the full audio tour. We had a boat reservation for 9 am and did the bulk of the audio tour after. When we got back from our trip to the memorial the place was very crowded.

One last thing…we used the Guidealong app around the island and found it very useful as well as entertaining. ",3,1762919356.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.8,False
1ouuvyi,https://i.redd.it/ccgfe3i20r0g1.jpeg,🩸🍹Everything You Need to Know About Fasting Before a Blood Test 🕒🥤,"If your doctor has ordered a blood test and mentioned fasting, you may wonder why it’s necessary and how to do it correctly. As a medical laboratory professional, I often get asked this! Here’s a clear guide to help you prepare and ensure accurate results. 👇  
  
💡 Why Do Some Blood Tests Require Fasting?  
Fasting prevents certain foods, drinks, and medications from affecting your blood levels. It gives the most accurate picture of your baseline health.  
  
Common tests that require fasting include:  
 ✔️ Glucose testing (for diabetes screening)  
 ✔️ Lipid panel (cholesterol & triglycerides)  
 ✔️ Basic or Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (BMP/CMP)  
 ✔️ Iron studies  
 ✔️ Certain vitamin and hormone tests  
  
🕒 What Does Fasting Mean?  
✅ No food or drinks (except water) for 8 to 12 hours before your blood draw.  
 ✅ Take medications only if your doctor approves.  
 ✅ Water is encouraged 💧 to stay hydrated and help with vein accessibility.  
 ❌ Avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, and chewing gum. They can alter test results!  
  
❓ Tips to Make Fasting Easier  
✔️ Schedule your test early in the morning to minimize discomfort.  
 ✔️ Stay hydrated with plain water.  
 ✔️ Avoid strenuous exercise before the test.  
 ✔️ Don’t skip the test! Rescheduling may delay diagnosis or treatment.  
  
⚠️ When to Ask Your Healthcare Provider  
Always confirm with your doctor or lab whether fasting is required for your specific test. Some tests may not need fasting, and certain health conditions might change the instructions.  
  
💉 The Bottom Line  
Fasting helps ensure the most reliable and actionable lab results. Following proper guidelines can make a big difference in your health care journey!

A little bit about me... I'm a hard-working, single guy with a great job, my own place, a car, a furbaby (cat), and some extra time to date. I'm passionate about healthy living, exercising, good conversation, music (80s and 90s pop, 90s rap, metal & classic rock), board games, video games, card games, movies (huge fan of horror, action and comedy movies) and outdoorsy activities. I'm family oriented and would love to have a big, fat, happy family one day. I love to socialize, drink (only really socially), go out to bars, do karaoke and play board games in groups. Also a big fan of arcade bars.

Realistically I'm looking for someone who I can trust in and someone who wants to be able to rely on and trust. I'm very loyal, crave communication, I'm emotionally available and would appreciate someone who is as well. I want to really get to know everything about you and develop a real *monogamous* relationship. I go to the gym regularly and I'm in pretty decent shape. Wouldn't mind if you also lift & do cardio like me so we can even work out at the gym together.

I'm of European descent (Mediterranean and English) but was born and raised here in Toronto. I'm average height - 5'9"", handsome, confident, intelligent, have brown hair and hazel eyes. I have a heart-warming smile and love to smile, make others smile and spread joy & good vibes. I like to think of myself as being harmonious, lovable and interesting to be around.

I prefer ladies who are in shape (not a dealbreaker), have a nice smile, are independent. have a good job and in general take good care of themselves. I'm emotionally intelligent and want someone to be able to care of who is capable of taking good care of me in return!

(nobody cares, why, though, me included🥰). Got plenty of hobbies like games, films, anime, but from something interesting I've got a greenhouse inside my dorm room, just bought Arduino to build another one for moss✨

Also a big lover of fermentation. Any kind. Alcohol, milk products, coffee (hate the stuff, but the deepness of taste is amazing), wanna try making a beer one day, when I get some space.

As I am overwhelmed by the ideas sometimes, it does not matter, because changes come next in most of the time, so I'm opened to hear your craziest thoughts on any kind of stuff, even if you figured out, how to mine a Moon without anyone noticing and make billions.

Anyway, I'm glad that you read it till that point, if so - feel free to DM, just don't say ""Hi"", say something fun about yourself - your favorite manga, what pizza do you hate the most, do you love spiders or no - just something, otherwise it is easy to see you as a bot.

King of the hill was my favorite show. Most other fourteen year olds didn’t like it, because they didn’t get it. But I did, I was a sharp cookie. I would watch it all the time with my dad, and sometimes my mom. But she didn’t like it that much, she said it had evil within it. If only I had listened to her I could have avoided so much evil. The day started like any other, except it was kind of sad. That was because King of the Hill was ending, the series finale was airing tonight. I stood with my dad on our deck, he drank a beer, and I drank a grape soda.

“Yep.” I said. 

“Mmhmm.” My father replied. He looked down at his watch. “Welp, just about that time I guess,” he said. He turned to me, the sun reflecting in his eyes, green leaves swirled behind him anime style. 

“Heh, heh, yep sure is.” I nervously fidgeted, “Will you still talk to me even if the show is over?” I asked. My dad shook his head. 

“I’m afraid not son, we will go our separate ways after this.” A tear slowly trickled down my face but I wiped it away. All I wanted was to see one last adventure in the land of propane and propane accessories, of Arlington Texas. We stepped inside, my mother was praying, she knew the hour was nigh. She wore a gleeful smile as we stepped towards the tv. My dad cracked open another beer, his fifth of the night. I was allowed as much soda as I wanted, so I didn’t complain. My mom had moved on emotionally already. The other day I caught her talking to somebody named Reginald. She had only shook her head and put a finger to her lips when I found out.

Flicking on the tv, the familiar logo popped up and the theme song played like usual. Suddenly, the sky turned black and lightning and thunder rolled. 

“Oh Damn.” my father said, seventh beer in hand. I felt goosebumps on my arms. The episode started strangely, which wasn’t too unusual because it was the finale. It was probably going to be an intellectual exercise for the real fans. I steepled my fingers in anticipation. My father saw this and rolled his eyes in disgust. My mother was muttering some nonsense about god in the background. Hank sat at his kitchen table. Except he was all alone. He wept as he drank a cup of coffee.	“Poor Hank.” My father muttered, his words slurring.

“Bwah!” Hank said suddenly. He flung his cup of coffee across the room, making it shatter into a thousand pieces. Peggy walked into the house really quickly. Like her animation was sped up. She stared straight at the tv screen, her beady eyes boring right into mine. 

“Heh. Pretty avant garde hey dad?” I asked. My dad just shook his head, muttering under his breath.

“Kid’s such a fucking loser.” He got up and left the living room. My mother rocked back and forth in her creaking chair needles clicking together, as she wove a sweater together. It had my dad’s face on it with big x’s in his eyes. She glared at my father’s back with malice in her eyes. I didn’t really care about that so I looked back at the tv. Peggy was still staring at the tv. Hank cursed in the background as he swept up his broken coffee mug. Peggy’s eyes suddenly went blood red, and they looked almost… hyper realistic. Which I thought was strange, but I didn’t think too much about it. Suddenly she raised her finger, opened her mouth and started screaming. It was really freaky and sent a shiver down my spine. Hank did not like this.

“For fuck’s sake Peggy you’ll scare him away!” He wrapped his elbow around her neck and drug her out of the room. Peggy kept screaming, finger pointed at the screen. I was too busy focusing on the fact that Hank had said fuck on tv to care about him breaking the fourth wall. Bobby ran into the room breathing hard. My dad sat back down with a rum and coke in hand. He let out a chuckle.

“Love this guy.” Bobby started doing a dance. 

“I’m a little candy man, ooh doo ooh.” Bobby kept doing this. A gunshot went off in the background. The couch creaked and I knew my dad was getting up again. He stumbled into my mom, and knocked her over, the rocking chair exploding as he did so. My mother let out a shriek, before scuttling away on all fours.

“She’s on the loose watch out.” my dad said. He stumbled back into the kitchen. The tv suddenly flickered, and then Hank, Bill, and Dale were drinking beer. Bill was weeping. 

“Well Hank I just don’t know why you did it I woulda married her.” Just peeking out behind the fence were Peggy’s iconic shoes. Hank took a sip of his beer, before slugging Dale so hard that his nose crunched. 

“Talk like that again Dautreve, and I’ll have your head!” My dad chuckled.

“You tell em Hank.” My mother let out a cry of war in the background. “Oh shit.”  Stumbling off the couch my father took off after the sound. Bobby was dancing in the background. However he suddenly turned around and then sprinted out of the house, and started doing his dance in the street while still looking right at me! I was seriously getting freaked out now. 

“Son of a bitch Bobby.” Hank threw a can of beer at Dale who was still crumpled on the ground. Luanne stumbled onto the screen, but as soon as she did a car mowed her over! Blood was everywhere. Bill pissed himself, and fell to his knees. Boomhauer got out of the car with an ak-47 in hand. 

“Man dang ol, gotta watch out man, tell you what it’s on now. Dang ol sorry Dale, man watch out for Hank!” Then he swung the gun down to his hip and gunned down Bill soviet style. Then he stepped all over Dale crunching his bones. He turned towards Bobby, who had tears in his eyes as he danced. He swung the gun like a club, cracking open his head laying him out in the street. 

“You shouldn’t have done that Boomhauer. Now I have to show you the might of propane and propane accessories.” The fence exploded into a million pieces, as Hank drove his lawn mower powered by two propane tanks. Boomhauer dodge rolled out of the way. He swung his gun around, but Hank was quicker. He pulled out a revolver and fired twice. Rain poured down from the clouds as the camera cut close to Boomahuer’s face. He spoke clearly.

“You shot me fair and true Hank, but I know Bobby would have done it clean.” He slumped to the ground dead. Dale gurgled, what sounded like a laugh. A loud bang from my house distracted me. My dad and mom were fighting again, but this time it was for keeps. My mother had embedded two of her knitting needles into my dad’s neck. He gurgled in pain, but he grabbed her by the hair.Quickly he spun around in a circle and trunchbull style threw her clear out the window letting in the storm outside. He ran out of the door, slamming it behind him. I turned back to the TV. Hank stood outside Strickland propane in his devil costume, with a battery powered skill saw in hand. 

“This is the finale boy,” he said. His eyes locked onto mine, and I knew he was talking to me. He truly was the king of the hill. He raised the saw into the air. “Trick or treat!” he screamed it loudly, his voice sounding insane. Buck Strickland burst out of the store, half naked.

“Son of a bitch Hank I was getting it on in there, weekends are for the Buck you know that!” Hank strode forward, and then fired up the saw, cutting open Buck’s throat in one smooth movement. Buck fell to his knees, blood spraying. Hank fired up the saw once more before embedding it into Buck's skull.

“Keep the change.” Using Buck's blood, he drew a strange eldritch symbol on the ground, before turning back to the sky, arms stretched upwards. “Wuul, dioltyer Mallak baaaq!” A portal opened in the sky, a mass of tentacles falling from it. My nose bled, and my brain broke as the eldritch horror appeared, devouring the world around it. Everything around Hank began to disappear. Hank walked towards the screen slowly as the screams of the damned filled the background. He stood, his face right next to the tv. Laying a hand on the screen he spoke softly.

“I have always loved you like a son Harry.  But the real horror has begun.” He pointed to his left. Too shocked to absorb the fact that he knew my name I looked to the left. My father had crucified my mother on a makeshift, and was twirling his shirt in the air. A bolt of lighting struck my mother and she exploded into flames while Dad did a little dance.  Turning back to the screen, all I saw was the end credits. Tears rolled down my eyes, as my dad danced in the background. The End.

Alright this is just a hot, maybe not-so-hot take, but why does Aldo’s coffee taste weird. I’m not just a plain hater and going to say it’s bad. Let break it down. Cold brews are the most unaltered form of coffee and you can really identify the notes in shops’ coffee beans this way. Aldo’s cold brew is giving fermented kombucha notes with manure somehow in the mix. It has a weird fungal aftertaste that I can’t get past. TBH I can’t even point at what the taste is but it makes me worried to consume, also cold brew isnt ever heated... Hot coffee is like a 6. K cups are better sadly. The only thing I can drink from Aldo’s is espresso. Not pure. You can still taste the manure that way; but in a latte. I’m sorry if you disagree you’re not ok. Anyways I got tired of Aldo’s. So I went to the place next to subway across the street. Asked for a coffee, latte, literally anything caffeinated and it’s like so much better. It’s not the best but literally what I want for what I’m paying for(cheaper than Aldo’s). Aldo’s idk what water you’re using or if you’re not cleaning containers or machines correctly but get your act together. seeing people actually drink it now is like 😣. Go to the library please.

It's marketed as efficient, modern romance. But in reality, they're a rigged game that warps how we connect and fries our brain's reward system. If you're serious about finding meaningful relationships, apps are often the wrong path. Here's why, backed by psychology, neuroscience, and real-world patterns.
1. They Turn Dating into a Slot Machine
Apps like Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge gamify human connection. Each swipe is a micro-gamble: Will this profile yield a match? A message? A date? Your brain releases dopamine (the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter) on the anticipation of a reward, not the reward itself.
Studies (e.g., from the Journal of Behavioral Addictions) compare this to slot machines: variable rewards (some swipes lead to nothing, others to a thrilling match) keep you hooked longer than predictable ones. Over time, this creates addiction-like behavior. Users check apps compulsively, even when it leads to burnout or ghosting.
Result? Superficial interactions. You judge people on curated photos and bios, not personality, shared laughs, or chemistry in a coffee shop line. Real connections build slowly through context. Apps skip that for instant gratification.
2. Dopamine Overload Leads to Emotional Crash
Dopamine isn't just pleasure; it's motivation and novelty-seeking. Apps flood you with it via notifications, likes, and matches, creating highs that crash into lows when conversations fizzle or dates flop.
Neuroscientist Anna Lembke (author of Dopamine Nation) explains this as a ""dopamine deficit state."" Constant stimulation desensitizes your receptors, making everyday interactions (like meeting someone at a party) feel boring. You chase the app's highs, but real relationships require effort, vulnerability, and delayed rewards. Apps undermine these.
Evidence: A 2023 study in Computers in Human Behavior found heavy dating app users report higher anxiety, depression, and lower self-esteem. The paradox of choice (too many options) leads to decision fatigue and regret, per Barry Schwartz's research.
3. They Mess with Authentic Connection
In-person meetings happen organically: through friends, hobbies, work, or chance. Apps force a marketplace mentality. Everyone's a profile to ""shop"" from. This breeds entitlement, ghosting, and disposable attitudes.
Stats back it: Pew Research (2023) shows only 12% of U.S. adults in relationships met via apps; most still meet through social circles. Apps amplify inequality too. Top profiles (attractive, witty) get 90% of attention, leaving others discouraged.
Long-term? Apps correlate with shorter relationships. A 2022 Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin paper linked app use to lower commitment levels, as users always wonder ""Is there someone better one swipe away?""",1,1762918656.0,KenyanDatingCommunity,0,1.0,False

I was reading an exchange on X that started out as someone wondering about how people they knew could drink coffee in the morning, and then feel OK about going to the temple later that day. There were a lot of responses from people discussing about how they thought someone might get there (things like noting that there are other sins that do not disqualify someone from a temple recommend, so why should coffee?)

But then someone came in the comments like a bull in the china shop saying something like, ""if you believe quakers are on the moon, then what does coffee matter"" to which the original person said, ""we don't believe that."" But then the heckler said something to the extent of, ""you're dismissing what Joseph taught. Next thing you'll say that you don't believe you can become Gods""

  
And the original person agreed that they don't believe that.

And that made me wonder how many things are shifting such that there might be meaningful differences in what people believe now vs a generation ago. 

I wrote a full blog post about this with a lot of possible belief statements, but do you have any other examples?

1ouui3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ouui3n/building_habits_that_stick/,Building Habits That Stick,"Forming a new habit, whether it’s exercising, reading daily, or learning a skill,  can be challenging. You might have heard it takes “21 days to form a habit,” but reality is a bit different. In fact, it takes about 66 days on average for a new behavior to become automatic. That’s over two months of consistency! The key is not willpower alone, but smart strategy. Here’s how to build lasting habits:



1. **Start Incredibly Small**: Make your new habit so easy you can’t fail. Want to start flossing? Begin with just one tooth each night. Exercising? Start with 5 minutes of stretching. When a habit is tiny, it doesn’t trigger much resistance, and once you’ve started, you often do more. The motto is make it so easy it’s harder not to do it.



1. **Tie it to an Existing Routine**: Use the power of cues by habit stacking. For example, if you want to journal each day, do it right after something you already do reliably, say, after your morning coffee. The existing routine (coffee) becomes a trigger for the new habit (journaling). Over time, your brain will link them.



1. **Be Consistent, But Flexible**: Aim to do your habit every day (or on a regular schedule) because repetition is what wires it in. However, life happens, if you miss a day, don’t beat yourself up. Just get back on track the next day. Avoid skipping twice in a row if you can. Think long term: you’re averaging out to most days.



1. **Track Your Progress**: Use a habit tracker or even a simple calendar to mark each day you do the habit. This creates a visual streak that you won’t want to break. Tracking also gives a sense of accomplishment, it’s rewarding to see that chain of X’s grow. 



1. **Reward Yourself & Make it Enjoyable**: Our brains stick with habits that feel rewarding. Additionally, celebrate your small wins. Did a week straight of language practice? Treat yourself to something nice on Sunday. Positive reinforcement trains your brain to associate good things with the habit.

  
**Stay patient and persistent**. Remember, “it can take much longer than many people think to form a habit, so it’s important to persevere” . The effort you put in now to repeat the behavior will pay off when one day you realize you do it naturally. Focus on one habit at a time, set yourself up for success with the tips above, and in a couple of months you’ll have a new positive routine running on autopilot.

Lately, our relationship has started to feel really heavy on me. My partner has always been somewhat irritable, but over the last five months (maybe longer), it’s gotten worse. She sometimes lashes out and gets extremely angry over small things. I’ve tried so hard to help her, but it’s becoming exhausting.

For example, today a new video game character came out that she wanted. I suggested she stream her pulls and that we could call and watch since we couldn’t hang out today. She liked the idea and invited two of our close friends to join. After she finished, I streamed briefly to show something to one of our friends, then stopped. A few minutes later, she messaged me privately, upset that she felt the attention had shifted away from her. I hadn’t seen the message at this time, and didn’t end up seeing it till around 20
minutes later. 

Then, during the same call, she brought up how I didn’t like the design of one of her favorite characters. I said, “Yeah, it’s just not my favorite, I guess,” and she suddenly started yelling at me in front of our friends, saying I was stupid for not liking it and that my opinion was wrong. I have high-functioning autism, so I understand being sensitive about personal interests, but it felt really disproportionate. I tried to calm things down by saying, “It’s just my opinion, you can still like them,I think they’re a really cool character! ” but she kept yelling until both our friends left. I told her we shouldn’t act like that in front of them and i felt bad, and she said, “What? I was just joking—it’s funny to argue.” She often does this where she becomes angry or passive aggressive and brushes it off as joking.

For another example, A few weeks ago, I accidentally spilled some coffee she gave me. I apologized, but she called me disgusting and gross and went on about it. I have lupus and severe anemia, so I often lose circulation in my hands and can be clumsy occasionally - especially since its starting to get cold where i live and thats often when it gets the worst for me. It already makes me feel bad, so hearing that really hurt. Things like this happen quite a lot. I apologized a lot when this happened, and later on ended up crying due to just being upset over it, and she stopped being angry and felt bad about it and apologized. 

I’ve brought these issues up many times, and she always apologizes and admits she knows it’s wrong. She says she doesn’t know how to change because she grew up around family members who also have anger and irritability problems. I feel a lot of empathy for her and want the best for her, but I’m stuck. I’ve suggested therapy and given her advice, but it feels like nothing changes.

She’s also very pessimistic and tends to complain as a way to cope, which I try to understand, but it’s emotionally draining and I often absorb her stress as my own. I understand this might be my own separate issue though. These outbursts don’t happen daily—more like every two or three weeks—but they take a toll on me.

I really love her and she’s not a bad person, but I don’t know how to keep handling this. I know this post might make her seem a little rude but she genuinely is a great person, but it’s hard to deal with some of the things she struggles with. I also struggled with an abusive parent growing up so I might just be more sensitive to this stuff as well, as i generally don’t feel like these events are over anything major, but it still hurts when it happens a lot and it feels very overwhelming. How can I support her better while protecting my own emotional health? Is there anything more I can do, or should I start focusing on how to navigate this for myself?

I’ve been roasting on the FreshRoast SR800 for a couple years now and finally built the tool I wished existed: a mobile/iPad-friendly roast logging web app made specifically for FreshRoast SR540/SR800 users (with or without the extension tube). It’s live, completely free, and ready for anyone who wants to kick their SR roasts up a notch.

# Why FreshRoast folks might care

* Live roast curve tracking – watch temperature and rate-of-rise charts update in real time, right during your roast.
* Quick weather + environmental data – auto pulls current temp, humidity, elevation, pressure so you know how the conditions might shift your roast.
* Dialed-in machine logging – log every fan/heat change with timestamps so you can replay exactly what happened.
* Phase + milestones handled – mark Dry End, First Crack, Second Crack, Cool; track Maillard and Development timers without losing your flow.
* Historical roast comparisons – overlay past sessions to dial in consistency, spot trends, and experiment with intent.
* Bean profile organizer – paste supplier descriptions or enter your own notes; everything stays structured and searchable for the next roast.
* Roast weight + yield tracking – log green/roasted weights and get instant loss percentages to monitor development.

# Built for the roasting workflow

* Works in any browser (phone, tablet, desktop).
* Clean interface that’s easy to run side-by-side with your roaster.
* Profile settings remember your machine, location, and unit preferences.
* Feedback link is right in the app so you can shout out bugs or feature ideas.
* No paywall, no ads, no email capture – just the tool.

👉 Try it: [https://roastbuddy.app](https://roastbuddy.app)

I’d love for more FreshRoast users to kick the tires. It’s still a side project, but it’s ready for real sessions – and if you have feature ideas, workflows you want supported, or roast data you’d like to visualize, I’m all ears. Happy roasting!

I, K (18F), am on a gap year after College, one of my closest friends, L, got into NYC (his dream uni) however I don’t even know if he went as I haven’t seen anything on social media about it and I haven’t spoken to him since prom, just after we finished college. 
I noticed he was getting distant before this however I always made an effort to still be there for him as he spoke about how difficult it was for him to make friends, all of our friends were mutual but I knew they weren’t speaking to him for the same reason that pushed me away. I would ask how he was and he would insistently say he was fine but still not act himself then if he did open up he would say stuff like “ofc I’m not okay” then explain why and say I couldn’t understand or help him. One big reason was because him and his gf were in a long distance relationship (she lives in America and we live in the UK) and he would push everyone away after leaving her seemingly because he was lonely and had few connections which is why tried for so long but eventually our relationship felt extremely transactional and that I could only be an inferior replacement of company to his gf not just a different relationship in its own right. His gf is a lovely girl and we had spoken online. She came to our joint schools’ prom and I expressed a little annoyance that he had not said anything about her visit so we could all hang out as it was nearing the end and we had spoken about us all doing that when she could visit. The day after he messaged saying they had some time before they left to London so they would love to see me. This surprised me but I happily accepted, he said he would meet me in the afternoon and we decided a time, so I headed home and got ready then head out and got there on time. I messaged to say I was in town and that if he wasn’t ready I would sit and have a coffee for a bit and that it was no rush. 40 mins and a few more texts later theres no reply so I called, he said he didn’t know because I didn’t text him to tell him I was setting off this frustrated me because he would have been just as likely to see a setting off message as a I’m here message but I just wanted to meet his gf properly so I didn’t make a fuss. He said they would get ready and be out soon, 40 mins later he calls and says that they still haven’t packed and they have to be ready for the train so they can’t do it. It takes me an hour for a one way trip there so not including getting ready that was over 3 hours of waiting and it’s just one good example of many of how I didn’t feel respected so I stopped giving him my energy, just flat out stopped talking. 

Since I am on a gap year I am missing almost all of my friends. I have thought about reaching out so much so that he and a few others have been in my dreams but I was scared of hurting myself if I got the same crap from him as usual so I never did considering all the chances I gave him in the first place. He messaged me tonight to say he missed me and asked how I was and sent me a picture of a moth saying he took it for me which is sweet. Now I’m thinking it was petty of me to never speak up, but I’m also unsure that this will last and scared that he’s only messaging because I’m his last option and that he doesn’t really care.

**What we’re after:**

* **Commute:** \~40 minutes or less to Burien and Auburn - I am being told that if choose to live in Seattle or Bellevue areas it will be reverse commute mostly? I am OK with \~40 min or less commutes
* **Vibe:** Safe, family-friendly, and a good snapshot of “Seattle life."" We are moving from the East Coast so are looking to take full advantage of PNW life
* **Walkability:** Cafés/coffee and parks/playgrounds and running trails
* **Daycares** \- Kids very young and would want reasonable daycare access
* Any spots with great **trail access** (e.g., greenbelts, lake loops) that also have a café cluster? We love to be outdoors and run and love weekend walks to coffee as a family.

Ideally we’d like to be in a neighborhood that’s considered “nice” or desirable, doesn't have to be ultra-fancy, but somewhere with a good community feel and low crime.  
  
We know very little about Seattle and the greater Seattle area and want to experience the culture and neighborhoods before choosing a forever home.

My husband and I are celebrating 10 years together at the Four Seasons. 

We arrived early, checked in at the front desk (room wasn’t ready yet), and were directed to the spa to begin our scheduled couples massage.

Spa services lasted about 5 hours, and afterward we got the keys to our room (Prime Corner Oceanview Room - 4 nights) and were surprised to find a small piece of cake with a celebratory “happy anniversary” card. It looked great.

We got set up in the room and about an hour later I went to go take a bite of the cake. It wasn’t until I was up close that I noticed the plate and dresser were covered in tiny ants. A whole army of them all marching in a big long line from the plate to behind the dresser. I was so grossed out, especially because I definitely stuck my finger in the frosting earlier to have a taste, and I don’t know how long the ants were there. 

I smited the ants (maybe 30 ants) and wiped the dresser down with some antibacterial hand wipes. I saw a few more ants later that night but didn’t think much of it. 

Fast forward, the next night we get back from dinner, and I see about a dozen ants crawling around the dresser. I cleaned them up and read on Google that ants hate coffee, so I opened one of the complimentary Nespresso pods and sprinkled the grounds all over the dresser.

Besides the ants, everything else has been exceptional. The service, food, amenities, the view— all of it. 

I’m already 2 nights in, and I don’t know if I should just ride it out or if I should give this feedback to the front desk. I don’t even know how to say it. I work in customer service, so I deal with dissatisfied customers all day, and I never want to be one of those annoying customers.

1ouu6jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1ouu6jt/post_ranch_inn_review/,Post Ranch Inn Review,"Location: Post Ranch Inn, Big Sur, CA (2 nights)

Who: My husband and I (early 30s) 



Property: 10/10 

The Post Ranch property is nothing short of stunning - a peaceful oasis high above the ocean and often above the clouds of the rugged Big Sur. We are very familiar with the area, having done a lot of backpacking and hiking in our 20s, exploring the Big Sur backcountry and all it has to offer. We had never treated ourselves to a more luxurious side until now. We loved the trail network throughout the property (only about 2.5 mi total but still lovely) and enjoyed the chef's garden, which was bountiful and everything looked incredibly fresh. We noticed many ingredients that we had at dinner from the night before. The architecture of the buildings is pretty spectacular - so much natural wood, stylistic metal railings and sculptures, it's very tasteful and beautiful. We were in awe for much of our visit on how well everthing is designed and organized. The pools were really beautiful - small and quaint, heated to a wonderful 102 degrees so basically infinity hot tubs, and set up as designated quiet areas for ultimate relaxation. That was very much appreciated and mostly adhered to. The restaurant itself is breathtaking! They really created such a warm and cozy atmosphere with stunning architecture and views even when the sun goes down. Lastly, the spa is very simple (no other amenities) but all I wanted was a good massage and I sure got it. It was a lovely massage (lymphatic, with dry brushing) and I felt very relaxed.



Rooms: 10/10 

We stayed in a Tree House room, wanting to be a bit more immersed in the woods rather than an ocean view (we live near the ocean currently - of course it never gets old, but we wanted to be more in the trees). We loved everything about the room: the unique shape, the wood paneling and design, the reading nook, the fireplace, everything. It was lovely, clean, and comfortable. An owl visited us each night and we could hear them whoo-ing near the window. We had great views of the mountains as well. The closet space was sufficient for our needs and the bathroom was very nice. Another small perk was the snacks and drinks provided. I appreciate when a hotel that is already charging a lot doesn't nickel and dime you with the mini bar bullshit. Not here! They had a half bottle of wine complimentary, beer, sparkling waters, juice, milk, kombucha, apples, pears, cheeses, crackers, cookies, nuts, chips, chocolate, granola bars, and chickpea crisps, all included. They replenished anything whenever we asked. 



Food 9/10 

We decided early on that we weren't interested in leaving the property at all, and just wanted to relax without driving anywhere, including meals. We had two dinners at Sierra Mar, two breakfasts, and one lunch (the poolside one, see the service comment below). The first night, we had the chef's tasting menu, and we were very happy with the food. We tried not to compare it to some of the more incredible meals we had lately with similar vibes (Harbor House Inn in Mendocino, for example, which it did not measure up to) but take it as it was. It was really lovely - some highlights were abalone congee, duck, yuzu sorbet, and matcha sponge cake crumble. The second dinner, we ordered a la carte and were happy with our choices (guinea hen, truffle gnocchi, kohlrabi soup), still delicious, but they weren't as notable as the chef's menu.

We were delighted with the drink menu (we are not really into wine) and their offerings. We enjoy cocktails and especially liked how they had classics with a unique twist - not weird enough to ruin a classic drink, but enough to elevate it. Throughout our weekend, we tried their versions of a margarita (a little prickly pear and jalapeno), a negroni (with benedictine, a nice touch), a gin drink with aloe liqueur and fennel syrup, and another whiskey drink that I can't remember. 

Our lunch at the pool was good, just very simple. I had a salad made into a wrap and my husband had a burger. Tasty, but simple. 

The breakfasts were also very good, I'd say great, but not amazing. I'm very much a breakfast person and enjoy trying new things, but the menu felt a bit standard - an omelette, eggs two ways with sides, french toast, eggs benedict and a breakfast burrito were most of the main options that we were interested in. There wasn't much uniqueness offered in the breakfast dishes. Overall though, coffee was great, fresh squeezed juices were delicious, and their sourdough bread is fantastic.  



Service: 8/10 

I want to preface initially that my husband and I are new to chubby travel. We've started to dabble in higher end properties in the last couple years and are still becoming familiar with what to expect and what is reasonable. That being said, I think we're still able to determine when service doesn't feel up to par. 

In general, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming; however, we felt really rushed when we arrived, I wasn't quite sure if that was just their style of being efficient to get you to your room and allow you to seize the day (and the little daylight left)! We were offered a glass of wine and then were immediately whisked away in a car to get a quick tour of the property and then dropped off at our room. I was barely able to sip the wine between getting in and out of the car and going to our room, but it was still nice. Upon arrival, we received a text to just reach out to that number if we needed anything. 

So, the other time the service was not great was while lounging by the pool. We wanted to order lunch to the pool, and noticed a small sign on the tables that asked us to place the order by using a poolside telephone (there is no poolside service person). Us being lazy and also being millennials and hating phone calls (it's silly I know but I really don't like it - I'd rather have a paper trail!) we texted the number to ask if we could order via text. They responded and said no, please use the pool phone. So we picked up the pool phone and pressed the buttons but nothing happened - just a dial tone. We proceeded to text back that the phone wasn't working. We didn't hear back for a few minutes, so we just called the restaurant directly, let them know the phone wasn't working, and finally made our order. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal, but just felt like a lot of roundabout communication that could have been much easier. 

Lastly, we were a bit unhappy that we weren't able to get a late checkout. The day we arrived, we requested a 2 PM checkout instead of 12 PM, which would have allowed one of us to make a virtual meeting at 1 PM that we unfortunately could not miss. Due to the remoteness of Big Sur and unreliability of WiFi, we didn't want to risk traveling and then taking the call somewhere random - we wanted to be in a private room. If we couldn't do that, we would have to leave the property at 8 AM in order to get home in time (we live elsewhere in CA). They told us that they could not confirm a late check out until the morning of. I guess I am not experienced enough to know if this is standard procedure. As we were enjoying our last night there, we even considered staying an extra night because we were enjoying ourselves so much (and the meeting would be a non issue then), and inquired if it was possible. They confirmed that yes, our room was available for another night. Which led us to be confused when they rejected our early check out request the next morning, our departure day, when wasn't the room supposedly available? I don't know if I'm asking for too much here but we were pretty disappointed, and ended up leaving around 8 AM as planned, instead of taking advantage of our half day up until noon check out time.

The hate comment was just what kind of got me to look back at things and realize woah, I'm not a fan of this!

There's a lot of background pieces to this, so I'll try to include them all before I get to the actual story.  Most of this takes place within like... September-October and earlier this month. 

I (17 FTM) am usually quite the shut in. I am in online school and I have a younger brother (12M) who is homeschooled by a tutor (25F) who we all absolutely adore, she is like an older sister to us both. This tutor has a younger brother (17M) (who we will call B in this story), who she said I might get along with, and she gave me his number. We had texted for a while but it was just friendly and stuff, though I found he was very sarcastic and sassy over text.

I also have another friend (17M) (who we will call A), and A and I had been planning to go to a renaissance faire together since April of this year when we were in an after-school program together. He's a very good friend of mine, and super awesome, and someone whose judgement I generally trust a lot.

Last bit of background, but I am also a smaller ASMR creator on Tiktok and Youtube. It's nothing much, but I'm known for some pretty crazy looks of mine and stuff. I love doing ASMR and it's a huge hobby of mine, but due to my crazy looks as well as being an openly queer creator I do regularly get some pretty gnarly hate comments and people wishing death upon me.

  
Ok, onto the main story. So, Tutor introduces me to B via text, we text every now and then. It's friendly, I think he's cool, nothing else to really say. I hadn't met him in person or anything. But, as A and I are planning our ren faire thing, he asks if it would be cool if he could invite some of his friends. I of course say yes, I'm totally fine with that, let's schedule a time to meet! And in doing this, I learn A goes to school with B and they're friends! Super cool! I get to meet B! So, all of us meet up at a plaza area to get food at this one place. It's me, A, B, and 3 other people. For the most part, it's great! but I notice some things about B that were kind of off putting. I didn't think anything of them at the time. He seemed weirdly fixated on like... groping my arms? Made a few comments about my skin being soft and I believe he squished my cheeks at one point. I found it a little odd, but I'm also someone who loves to be physically affectionate with my friends and I'm not THAT bothered. Another thing that was kind of weird was he'd ask in a very sincere voice ""Are you okay?"" ""What's wrong, cmon, tell me"" and stuff like that. I respond honestly because uh. I genuinely did not know that this is apparently a bit he does and is in fact not a sincere ask of if I'm doing okay and asking to hear about whether or not I am okay. 

So yeah. First interaction. Weird but not bad. He's nice and nice enough to walk me back to my car (It was dark by the time we're leaving the plaza, I parked a little further away and I am a 5'2 very petite person. So. Best to be safe) and all in all I think nothing of the stranger parts of the interaction.

A few weeks later, though, B asks to hang out at a coffee shop! He also invites A, which truly may have been the saving grace because I do not know B as well and thus am not nearly as relaxed talking to him.

This is where things got... weird. And uncomfortable.

Two things I should very much so clarify. I am 5'2"" and 100-or-so pounds. I am a STICKBUG. B is over 6 feet tall and is a wrestler. B also is actively dating someone.

Once again, B is very grabby. But it's... kind of painful. He'd grab my arm and squeeze like he's using my arm as a stimtoy and he'd also grab around my elbow, which is an area I just do not like to be grabbed by (it's kind of stupid, it just makes me think of someone trying to access the vein there for an IV, and for whatever reason that freaks me out). He also would grab my hand or fingers and squeeze when I'd try to pull them away. I'd kinda be like. ouch, hey that hurt, and he'd brush it off like ""how did that hurt??"" And like. Annoying, yes, but he's a teenage boy and also I felt like he was just kind of Like That.  I was (and am) also pretty sure he was genuinely just stimming and meant nothing at all by it.

Then he decided to put me in a headlock. Again, let me reiterate. 5'2"" stickbug. 6foot wrester. And he decided to put me in a headlock. I told him it hurt and he let me out of it but he did the kinda ""how did that hurt???"" thing to which I told him his bracelets were uncomfortably pressing into my throat. Which they were! 

We move on from that quickly. Me, A, and B are chatting and doodling in our respective sketchbooks and B starts doing the kind of sexual jokes a lot of teenagers are prone to making, even I occasionally make one. Though, I will note I do not really like making those jokes about other people or having them made about me. I felt his got weird, though, and maybe I am just very sensitive but I'm not sure. He started joking about A being a cuck, and then that became him saying that A would cuck B and I. which I immediately thought was weird because 1, this is my second meeting with this guy, and 2, B has a partner. Of course, this is most likely just silly immature joking and I'm being sensitive. I don't know. But it made me uncomfortable.

Along with that, there was another kind of minor thing he did, where he was being very silly dramatic and leaned on me to the point his head was vaguely around my chest. Now, I had mentioned earlier in the interaction that I was chest binding, just offhanded comment like ""i probably should have worn a shirt under this sweater because you can see my binder a little bit"". Easily tossed away. Not brought up again. but B, after sitting up for a minute, looks at me and is like ""it's not weird (that he had his head near my chest) because you're binding!"" Which kind of instantly made it weird. I genuinely would not have cared. I didn't even think of it being weird. But after that comment, it just... seemed off?? Not sure. It's most likely nothing but I'm trying to provide all the things that stood out to me in this interaction.

Now, one of the things I'm upset about. I hadn't even registered this until much later when I was thinking back on this interaction. I started talking to A about how I know B's sister, and thus I start talking about my brother, because he's a super cool kid and i love bragging about him. Then, B pipes up in this really weird voice, like,, think Patrick from Spongebob, ""(Brother's Name) is like i LiKe MiNeCrAfT!"" Very small comment, right? May I add that B HAS NEVER SEEN MUCH LESS INTERACTED WITH MY BROTHER. And I felt like the voice he used was really degrading and just kind of mean especially when talking about your friend's 12 year old brother. Like. Dude what was that about???

Anyways, later that day. I get home and decide to set up to film some Tiktoks because, well, i needed to post and I hadn't for a bit. Plus, my makeup was all done up from the hangout and I felt really cool! B had asked me to make a video for him and requested a few specific triggers, nothing crazy, I had fun with the video and it does well! But I get this comment on there. And it is the ONLY nasty comment on there, from an account I don't know, pretty much calling me stupid. Something along the lines of ""stay in school or else you'll turn out like this."" I dont think much of it, I get told much worse shit online. Being called stupid isn't nearly as bad as being told to end myself because I'm less than human for being queer. But, of course, some of my followers respond to the comment saying that the person is being a jerk and to shut up, because, well, it's a mean thing to say!

A few days later, I get this text from B. It said (paraphrased from my memory) ""I'm sick of your commenters. I posted this funny comment and they're coming after me. Love the video you made!""

The only hate comment on that video, from an account with no way to identify who it was, no posts, no bio, nothing, was apparently from B, who the video was made for!! And he was getting upset that the asshole thing he said was making people say he was being an asshole! I told him that well, hey even i thought it was just some hate comment, there was no way for anyone to tell, and if he's going to joke like that again then he needs to identify that it was a joke and not just him being a jerk. I'm so glad he liked the video, but also... why feel the need to comment that?

After that, i started looking back on all our interactions, realized like... oh... I'm not comfortable with A LOT of this. Like i'm really not okay with it. 

I stopped responding to his texts after that. i feel like Im an asshole for not just telling him my issues with his behavior, but I had talked to A about it since he's a good friend of mine and knows how B works, and A had even said that B has been a jerk to a lot of people as of late, and anyone who tries to bring it up just gets shunned by B and treated like some kind of enemy. You pretty much can't talk to the guy. 

I was ignoring his calls too. But I ended up answering one a few days prior to the ren faire because I didn't want to completely ghost him when I was going to see him soon. It was a 3 minute call, nothing important to note, but I know something has got to be not-good with this friendship when the moment it ends, my anxiety is so bad I nearly vomited. I did not answer his follow up call for that reason.

I'm really really not okay after learning how B has been treating some of the people who should be his friends, and I even saw it when we went to the ren faire earlier this month (it ended up being me, A, B, and one other friend. the other two people ended up not able to come with) . Now, it was mostly great! i had a wonderful time! I, A, and our other friend had an amazing time and for a good half of the faire, B just kind of went off and did his own thing, but when he was around? He was just a jerk to our other friend! Now, i know he's upset with her for something that she just didn't know about and he didn't explain. But the way he treated her was just mean. No other way to put it. 

The issue for me is I know kind of why B is acting like this. It's not my business to share but he's got a lot of shit going on in his life, and i know this from his sister who is also dealing with this stuff even if to a lesser degree. But it is not fair to me or anyone else how he is lashing out at people and frankly I really don't want to stay friends with him, he makes me nervous and I really do not at all fuck with people who talk any kind of shit about my brother - especially when they don't know my brother! But I am also aware that B is a teenager who is going through some really difficult stuff. He is a kid. He does not deserve the chaos in his life and truthfully I think he is a very good and kind person at the heart of it, i am just really not comfortable with how he's acting and how he's made me feel.

I feel like I should have been more honest about how he made me feel, though. I am scared to talk to him and truly at the current moment I have absolutely 0 plans to contact him again. I really hope things get better for him but I do not think I can be apart of his social group after all of that.  I also think a lot of his comments probably had no ill intentions at all, and i am probably being much too sensitive about this sort of thing, but I'll leave that judgement up to you.

Please note that I have talked to my parents about a lot of it. I usually go to them for advice and some things that happened were what I'd call a ""tell a trusted adult"" scenario. I even talked to a friend of mine who is a bit older than me and she even said she thought his behaviors were weird and that she really thought he might be into me or something, which, while I do not think he has any feelings for me at all, I really disliked the more sexualized comments being made about me. 

I've had a few people say I am kind of overreacting or I was being a bit of a jerk by just completely ghosting him, which I totally understand, but I feel like considering the circumstances with him really not being someone i want to keep in my life and someone I don't really know, some of it is kind of reasonable.

The posts and comments on various social media sources  are delivering a lot of thoughts and new ideas! Of course, this narrative part can be extended/modified and I am pretty sure that this one will be interesting not only for people who are interested in existential philosophy but also in Greek philosophy and myths. Since I am interested in both...dare me have I tried to make something experimental and I hope you will be enjoying. Looking forward to see all of interesting and controversial comments.

I'm sorry if my English is bad; it's not my first language!!

So... I met this girl on the first day of college (to give her a name, I'll call her *Dalia*). Dalia and I became really close very quickly; we had the same type of humor, we both liked video games, and it was such a healthy friendship, we could talk about anything without judgment, and we could laugh and joke about everything but also be serious and be there for each other when we needed it the most.

When I first met her, she told me she was a lesbian, and I told her I was *VERY* straight just to clarify things (but I didn't mind at all; I don't really see a person based on their sexuality). I didn't treat her any less; I treated her like any of my girl friends.

I remember we once had a conversation about ""what's your type,"" and as she described her type, it was almost identical to how I look. I remember I acted dumb and didn’t think too much of it; I just hyped her up and kept on talking about recent crushes or if we had seen anyone cute on campus.

That was it, but as our friendship continued, I met this guy, whom both my friend Dalia and I became friends with (I'll name him *Mostacho*). This guy soon started hanging out with my friend Dalia, another friend, and me. I liked him—he was funny, had the same humor as all of us, and was just really such a cool person to hang out with.

But one day, out of nowhere, I started noticing that my friend Dalia would become very quiet when he started hanging out with us, to the point that it was pretty obvious she was upset or something. When I asked her if everything was okay, she just said she didn’t feel comfortable around Mostacho and it was just “a thing” she had to work out with herself.

I was confused because we were such a nice group and she was the closest to him, but out of nowhere she didn’t want to hang out with him. From that moment on, things changed because now that I knew she felt uncomfortable, I decided to hang out less with him or only when it was just the two of us.

But I was pretty much upset about the whole deal because there actually was a nice dynamic between everyone, but one day she just decided it was not. I respected her and moved on,until one day I got the news that this guy had a crush on me and wanted to go out on a date.

Dalia was the one to tell me, and because I didn’t like the guy in that way, I just simply told him no, and that was it. After that, I started getting a bit suspicious and tried connecting the dots about her being serious or “uncomfortable” with this guy and him then liking me.

After that, I remember it was summer break, and when we got back to college again, we started becoming more of a friend group with a bunch of the people we had in our first semester—especially with two guys that we started hanging out with early in the mornings as we waited for our first class.

These two guys would talk more with Dalia than with me, but when I arrived, like 30 minutes later, we would all get together and chat about anything. Everything was great; I was happy to get to be close with these two guys and the whole group of friends.

(I really never had the opportunity to have lots of friends growing up because I was homeschooled, and so having a group of friends was like a dream to me.)

We went for tacos sometimes or coffee all together and had more freedom to make plans because one of the guys had a car and drove us everywhere.

This is where the *whole problem* started.

So, my friend Dalia decided to invite me and our two guy friends to a Halloween party. We were all very excited to go, and as the day got closer, these guys called me and told me that they could pick Dalia and me up to go all together. I agreed, although Dalia said she was going by herself and it was okay.

As they arrived at my house, we all put on our Halloween costumes and got ready for the night. We went to buy some drinks and arrived. As we waited outside for Dalia to arrive, I was happy to see her and said hello, but she just seemed distracted or distant. I noticed this but didn’t really say anything.

She was waiting for one of her friends, and when her friend arrived, she just went into the party, and we went to park the car in a nearby parking lot. It just weirded me out, she was a bit distant and didn’t even really say hi to me, like she was upset.

As we got inside, the party was just starting, so it was awkward at first. I tried talking to Dalia, but she was just talking to her other friend, not even looking at me, and at one point just stood up and went to take pictures with him.

I just looked at her, and she looked at me—she didn’t invite me for a picture too or seem to want to talk. So I decided if she was going to go do her own thing, *I’m going to do mine*.

So I just talked with the two friends who picked me up, and we stayed almost the whole night together drinking, talking with some other people, and stopping me from grabbing a dead opossum. It was fun. We stayed most of the party outside in the garage because the music inside was too loud to talk. I and Dalia would bump into each other from time to time in the party. I really was a bit upset she just didn't talk much to me or didn't even invite me for a picture. (I know it's not her job to, but if we are really close friends, why out of nowhere would she treat me like I'm just some stranger) My friends and I talked a bit to her and stayed there listening to the loud ass music as we all drank, and that was it, soon she left, and also us.

**The next day at college**, I started noticing her complete change of attitude. She was distant from me now and quiet, and when I asked her if she was okay—and if I'm completely honest, she was acting weird as hell because she was never like that with me—she just denied it.

When I tried talking to her about it, she just kept on her phone, watching reels and typing with some friend, laughing as I just sat there trying to figure out what happened. Basically, that happened for three days straight of her avoiding me.

And of course, I got upset af. When I finally got the opportunity to talk to her, she just told me I wasn’t the problem—but the two guy friends we hang out with were, because she said she didn’t expect to get too close to them. Once again, she said she feels uncomfortable being around them and that now the dynamic between us changed because we can’t just be the two of us talking anymore.

So basically, again, she just wouldn’t hang out with them because of that. This time, I told her I respect how she feels and everything, but in my case, I’m still going to hang out with them because they’re part of the whole group of friends. I’m going to spend time with her and also some time with them, ‘cause I’m not going to stop hanging out with them just because she feels uncomfortable around them.

They’re my friends at the end of the day, and it’s not like the guys are weird. What *is* weird is that after I told her that, she just started becoming distant af. When I text her asking where she is so I can go with her and talk like we used to before, she just doesn’t respond. She isn’t at our usual place anymore, and it’s like I’m evil for choosing to split my time with both.

So I’m suspicious that maybe she likes me or something, ‘cause it’s such a coincidence how she only gets upset when I hang out with guys or become friends with them, and she just says she feels uncomfortable. Mind you—it’s not like she doesn’t like hanging out with men, because she does, and she has a bunch of guy friends too. And my two guy friends tell me that when I'm not around she greets them normally and even chats with them, so I'm confused.

What’s shitty about it is that now she just completely distanced herself from me like I did something bad. but i don't know what she expects—for me to just be by her side and hang out with nobody but her? I don't know, I'm just upset by the whole deal.

So i don't know what to do—try to talk to her or something, because I don't want to ruin a year of friendship, although i don't know if she sees it that way, or just follow my own path, I guess.",2,1762916863.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

The official story is that Tom blacked out at depth and got tangled. “Freediver error.” Our fault. The report doesn’t mention the band of dead water where the fish wouldn’t go. Or the thing that pulled on our float line like it was checking what we were.

It was Tom’s idea to book that trip.

We’d both finished a level-two freediving course a month earlier down in La Jolla. Passed our thirty-meter dives. Learned how not to die in blackout scenarios. Came home with new dive watches and an inflated sense of our own competence.

Tom went all-in. Sold his longboard to buy carbon fins. Started DMing comp divers he followed like he was networking now. He wanted depth records and sponsor tags. I just wanted to stop feeling like my lungs were going to explode at ten meters.

“Glass out there,” he texted me that morning. “Harbor webcams look like a lake. You working?”

I was off. I had my phone in one hand and a mug of coffee from the office Keurig in the other. My boss had just dropped the schedule for the next two weeks on my desk: wall-to-wall shifts.

“If I say no, will you leave me alone?” I wrote back.

He sent a selfie from the dock instead of answering. Thick black 5mm suit peeled down to his waist, hood hanging. Behind him: a faded white charter boat with KATE LYNN painted on the stern in chipped blue letters, and a captain who looked like he’d been carved out of sun damage and cigarettes.

“Spot’s paid for,” the caption read. “You can nap on the way out.”

I stared at my calendar for another second, thought about two weeks of fluorescent lights and stale break room air, and caved.

“Give me thirty,” I typed. “Don’t let the captain leave without my pretty face.”

The harbor was quiet when I got there. Gulls yelling over the fish processing plant, a couple of guys pushing carts of tanks down the dock, diesel and salt in the air. The kind of morning brochures like to pretend is every morning.

KATE LYNN bobbed at the slip. The captain checked our names off a clipboard, then did the safety spiel in the bored tone of someone who’s done it four times a week for twenty years.

“Life jackets under the bench, O₂ here, first aid kit here,” he said, tapping each box with a knuckle. “If you’re gonna pass out, try not to do it under the boat. You guys are just breath-holders, right? No tanks?”

“Just freediving,” Tom said, grinning. “We brought our own float and line. We’ll stay on it.”

The captain looked at the orange float at Tom’s feet, the coiled hundred-foot line, the small anchor clipped to the end. He grunted.

“Every guy says he’ll stay on the line,” he said. “Every season someone chases a fish and makes me call the Coast Guard. You wanna screw around, do it on someone else’s boat. We clear?”

“Yes, sir,” Tom said, still smiling. He always smiled when someone challenged him. It was like a reflex.

We motored out of the harbor, around the breakwater, and into low, gentle swell. The water outside was stupidly calm—small rolling bumps, no whitecaps. The kind of day you talk about for months afterward.

“Gonna drop you boys on the outside edge of the big bed,” the captain yelled over the engine, pointing at a darker patch ahead of us. “Sounder says twenty-eight meters. Lots of bait and bass under the canopy. You’ll have company.”

Tom practically vibrated. “Dude, if the viz is even decent, this is gonna be sick,” he said in my ear. “You brought your slate, right?”

I tapped the little white plastic board clipped to my belt. “Yeah, yeah. I brought your underwater notepad.”

He’d made fun of me when I bought it—“what, you gonna write poetry at twenty meters?”—until he got tired of having to surface every time I wanted to tell him something.

We passed over the kelp bed. From above, it looked like a thick mat of bronze coins, glossy in the morning sun. Sea lions popped their heads up and watched us go by, glistening and smug.

The captain put us on the outside edge, where the kelp thinned enough that you could swim between stalks without sawing your mask strap off. He killed the engine, the boat settled, and the hull started its slow, rhythmic roll.

We suited up. I pulled my 5mm over my shoulders, smeared spit in my mask, checked my snorkel clip. Tom fussed with his GoPro mount, making sure the little camera on his forehead was angled just right.

“Record or it didn’t happen,” he said, tapping it.

“Just don’t headbutt the boat,” I said. “Those videos are harder to monetize.”

He laughed, hopped to the transom, and did a clean flat-back entry into the water. I followed less gracefully. The cold slid down the back of my suit in that way it always does the first time, like someone poured ice along my spine. Then the neoprene sealed and it was bearable.

We swam the float a few meters into the bed and dropped the anchor weight between a cluster of kelp holdfasts, careful not to wrap the line around anything. The line hung down into the green.

I put my face in the water and forgot about the boat for a second.

Kelp is different from the top than it is from inside. On the surface it’s a mat. Underneath, it’s a vertical forest. Thick stalks rising from the bottom in tight groups, blades streaming out like flags in the swell. Sunlight slants down between them, turning the water gold and green.

Ten meters down, I could see fish already. Blacksmith, little rockfish, bright orange Garibaldi. A sea lion shot past, just a blur of smooth muscle.

It was beautiful. It was exactly the kind of setting you see in freediving videos with soothing music and inspirational captions.

That’s the problem with a lot of horror: if you freeze-frame it early, it looks like a screensaver.

We started with warm-ups.

Tom grabbed the line first, floated face-down for a couple of minutes, slowing his breathing. Then he jackknifed, did a clean duck dive, and started pulling himself down hand-over-hand, fins trailing.

I watched his long black fins disappear into the kelp’s lower levels. The forest swallowed him quickly.

My watch ticked time on my wrist. Twenty seconds. Thirty. Forty-five.

He came back up after maybe a minute, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, short exhales and big inhales like we’d been taught.

“Clear,” he said between puffs. He pulled his mask up for a second, eyes bright. “Man, it’s insane down there. Like a real forest. Big bait balls at ten, fifteen. Bass cruising through. You’re gonna lose your mind.”

I wasn’t sure if that was the phrase I wanted to hear. I tugged my mask back into place anyway.

“I’ll go to fifteen,” I said. “Stretch my ears out. Don’t move the float.”

He saluted.

I floated face-down, filling and emptying my lungs at a slow, steady rhythm. You can feel your heart rate drop if you pay attention, like someone letting off a brake pedal.

One more inhale—comfortably full, not max—and I tipped forward, hands sliding down the line.

The water closed over my head. Sounds from the boat dulled, replaced by the small noises of my own exhale and the creak of kelp.

I equalized every meter or two, pinching my nose and puffing gently until the pressure behind my sinuses eased. The light dimmed, turned greener.

Around ten meters, I passed into the busy zone. Schools of anchovy flickered between blades. A Garibaldi rushed up to my mask, turned, and flashed his orange side at me like a dare. Small rockfish hung near the stalks, their fins barely moving.

I stopped around fifteen, one hand on the rope, and just hung there.

Below me, the forest went on. Stalks thickened, closer together. The beams of light thinned. The bottom was somewhere another ten, twelve meters down from where I was, hidden in shade.

And below where I hung, past maybe twenty meters, the movement… stopped.

Up where I was, life was everywhere. Little flicks of silver, flashes of color, shadows of larger fish pushing through the schools.

Down there, there was nothing. No bass. No perch. No crabs on the holdfasts. Just kelp blades swaying in slow motion.

If there had been no fish anywhere, I’d have blamed temperature or oxygen or something else we learned about in passing. But the line was sharp. As if something had drawn a horizontal cutoff and everything with gills got the memo.

The hair on my neck prickled under my hood.

My lungs tapped me on the shoulder, reminding me I wasn’t down there on a tank. I turned, looked up, and pulled myself back to the surface.

Breaking through is usually a small relief. This time it felt like getting pulled out of a room you’d walked into by mistake.

“How’s it look?” Tom asked, hooking one arm over the float.

“Pretty,” I said. “And weird. Lots of activity up top. Nothing below twenty. Like a desert.”

He frowned behind his mask. “Like dead?”

“Not dead. Just empty.” I hesitated, then added, “Feels… wrong. Like it shouldn’t be that sharp.”

He shrugged. “Thermocline, maybe. Fish hang where the food and temp line up. You want the deep zone left to us.”

I tugged my slate up, flipped it around, and wrote:

FISH STOP AT 20

NOTHING MOVES LOWER

GIVES ME A BAD FEELING

I handed it over.

He read it, then tapped his pencil against the plastic for a second, thinking.

COULD BE TEMP / O₂

I’LL GO LOOK CLOSER

STAY ON LINE

He flashed me an okay sign, took a couple of big breaths, and dipped under again.

I watched his fins track down the line. Five meters. Ten. Fifteen. The schools parted around him.

He passed my strange “boundary” and kept going, into the emptiness.

At around twenty-five meters, he let go of the line and drifted a little to the side, turning slowly like he was panning for the camera.

I held the rope and saw him hang there, a dark shape in the green, a little cloud of bubbles escaping his hood and climbing toward me.

He stayed longer than I liked. Tom could do two-minute dives in class when he was focused, but this was cold water, a thick suit, current.

I shifted my grip on the line, not pulling, just… ready.

Something moved below him.

It was just at the edge of what I could see. A long, pale shape, thicker than any fish I’ve seen here, slid between two clusters of kelp at maybe thirty meters. I thought at first it was a trick of the light—the way shadows shift when surge moves the blades.

Then it turned.

Fish bend. Eels bend. Their whole body curves in one line.

This thing’s movement was segmented. One part of it seemed to pivot first, then the next, then the next, like someone turning a stack of boxes one at a time.

I couldn’t see a head. Just length and those strange jointed turns.

My hand went automatically to the handle of the knife on my belt, making sure it was still there.

The pale shape angled up, a little, and stopped. I had the horrible, specific sensation that it was… listening. The way a dog cocks its head when it hears a sound you don’t.

I looked down the line for Tom.

I didn’t see him at first. Just the kelp. Just the band of nothing.

Then a hand slid onto the rope from below, gloved fingers wrapping tight. His other hand followed. He started pulling himself up with powerful, calm motions. No panic.

He surfaced a couple of meters from the float, blew out, and did his recovery breathing, eyes closed.

“Big sand bass,” he said after a few breaths, laughing a little. “Just out of range. And yeah, dude, that band is freaky. It’s like someone drew a line where the world stops.”

I didn’t mention what I’d seen under him. I wasn’t ready to give it a name out loud. Not yet.

“Let’s maybe not hang in it,” I said instead. “We can stay in the busy part.”

He squinted at me. “You good?”

“I’m fine,” I lied. “I just don’t want to stack deep dives on an empty stomach. Couple of shallower ones, then I wanna go annoy the captain.”

He snorted. “You and your ‘don’t die’ kick. One more deep for me, you stay at fifteen like a safety diver. That cool?”

My slate was still in my hand. I almost wrote NO in big letters and held it in his face.

Instead I wrote:

YOU STAY ON LINE

I STAY ABOVE YOU

ONE MORE, THEN SHALLOW ONLY

He tapped the OK sign against it, then against his own chest, like he was swearing an oath.

We did the next one together.

We floated side by side for a minute, breathing slow. Inhale, exhale, long pauses, feeling our heart rates settle. The surface layer was cold enough along my cheeks that my lips were slightly numb.

“Last deep,” he said, mostly out of habit.

We both took a final inhale, duck-dived, and grabbed the line.

It feels different when two people are on the same rope. You can feel the small added tension, the tiny shifts when one of you kicks a little harder. His fins were just below me, flashing in my peripheral vision.

Five meters, ten. The kelp closed around us like pillars in a strange cathedral. Fish flared away, then drifted back in.

At eighteen meters, the water temperature dropped. I felt it slide into my hood and along my jaw, a clean, sharp chill. I equalized. So did he; I could hear the faint crackle.

At twenty-two, we crossed into the empty band. The busy world of flickers and shadows ended. Below: dim green-brown stillness.

We hung there for a second, both holding the rope, looking down.

I don’t know what he saw that I didn’t. Maybe the thing moved differently for him. Maybe something passed closer.

All I know is his eyes went from normal to wide behind his mask in a heartbeat, pupils big and flat.

He didn’t bolt. A panicked diver kicks. He just stopped, fingers going white on the line.

My own heart rate spiked. Every part of me that wasn’t brain wanted to twist around and look behind me. Training said don’t spin around in kelp like an idiot.

I didn’t turn. I slid closer and wrapped my off hand around his forearm.

He flinched, then looked at me. Little bubbles leaked from his nose as he exhaled more than he should have.

I pointed up. Exaggerated. The “we go now” sign.

He hesitated longer than I liked, then nodded and started up, slow and controlled.

We rose through the empty band, through the cooler water, back into the busy zone. Fish reappeared. The light brightened.

Something brushed my fin.

Not kelp. I know what kelp feels like—soft, slick, a little give.

This was firmer. Cooler in a different way. It slid along the blade from toe to heel and then was gone, too deliberate to be surge.

Every muscle in my body wanted to kick hard and get away from whatever that was. I forced my legs to keep their slow rhythm. Fast, sloppy kicks waste oxygen. I needed that more than I needed distance.

We broke the surface and did our recovery breaths. My hands shook a little on the float.

“You feel that?” he asked, breathy. “Something big moved down there. Like… like a log in a current.”

“Something touched my fin,” I said, throat dry. “Slid along it. Not kelp.”

“Probably just a seal,” he said automatically, then seemed to hear himself. There had been no seal silhouettes on that dive.

I pulled up my slate, wrote with my hand cramping tight:

I DON’T LIKE THIS

WE SHOULD GO BACK TO BOAT

He read it, looked at the boat—tiny and a little too far away for my taste—and made a face.

CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT

1–2 MORE SHALLOW ONLY

THEN WE BAIL

I wanted to say no. I really did. But you don’t go from “we’re fine” to “trip over” easily, especially when you’re out there on someone else’s time.

“Shallow,” I said. “Nothing below ten. Stay where we can see the hull. If anything pulls the line again, I’m out.”

“Deal,” he said. He actually stuck his hand out above water. I slapped it.

We unclipped the anchor weight and swam the float a bit closer to the edge of the bed, where the kelp thinned and the surface light punched down more cleanly. I could see the underside of the KATE LYNN now, the ladder, the hull rolling.

We did a few easy dives. Eight, ten meters, weaving in and out of the upper canopy. Anchovy schools glittered in the sunbeams. A sea lion rocketed by once, close enough that I felt the pressure wave on my suit.

For a bit, I almost managed to relax. I still checked the nothing-band every time I looked down. It was still there, a horizontal limit where all the life stopped as if cut off.

On the surface between drops, Tom was buzzing.

“Dude, this footage is going to be insane,” he said. “If I don’t look like a total kook, I’m gonna cut together a clip for that brand contest.”

“Make sure you tag ‘screamed internally,’” I said. “Accurate hashtag.”

He laughed and ducked his face back in the water.

I was floating on my back, staring at the sky, when the first big wrong thing happened.

The float jerked.

Not a little bob from swell. A hard, sudden yank from below that pulled part of the buoy under and dragged it a full foot toward the forest’s center.

The rope between my hand and the float went tight enough that the nylon creaked.

I rolled over fast, mask snapping back down, heart jumping into my throat. Tom had just broken the surface by the float, half a body length away, so I knew it wasn’t him pulling on anything.

The line dipped under my hand again, harder. The float dunked, water washing over its top. The clips on its sides rattled.

“Grab the line,” I said, out of breath even though I was on the surface.

“Dude, let go if it’s snagged—” he started.

The tension vanished.

The rope went slack, then slowly straightened again in the gentle surface swell.

I peered down along it.

The anchor weight we’d unclipped was clipped to the float now, so there was nothing heavy on the end. The line just hung, disappearing into the green.

Between two stalks about ten meters down, the light bent slightly. Something pale slid away from the rope, deeper into the kelp. I caught the jointed, segmented way it moved again before it vanished into shadow.

It had been holding our line and then decided to let go.

I didn’t think. I pulled the whole length up hand-over-hand until the end snapped out of the water. No kelp wrapped around it. No debris. Just the bare, wet rope.

“I’m done,” I said. My voice sounded flat. “That’s it. I’m going back to the boat.”

Tom opened his mouth, then shut it. For the first time since we’d left the harbor, he really looked at my face.

“Okay,” he said. He sounded like he meant it. “Okay. Let me do one last pass under the canopy and then we both go in, yeah? Just shallow. I won’t even go past the first holdfasts.”

He said it like a smoker promising to only have one more cigarette that night. Habit. Momentum.

“No deeper than ten,” I said. “You stay where I can see you the whole time. If you chase a fish, I swear to God I’ll cut your fins off.”

He gave me a weak grin. “You love me too much. I’ll be right back.”

He took two or three calm breaths, duck-dived, and slipped under.

I kept my face in the water. I wasn’t going to be the guy staring at the sky when his buddy vanished.

He leveled out around eight meters, just under the sun-speckled canopy, and swam parallel to the edge of the bed. A school of bigger fish—the kind that make people spend too much on spearguns—hung just out from him. White sea bass, probably. Thick bodies, faint stripes.

He didn’t have a gun with him, but instinct is instinct. He angled toward them a bit, curious.

They flared away, then re-formed, moving just ahead of him. He followed for a few kicks, still in that upper band.

I was about to tap on the float and signal him back when the entire school snapped upward in a tight, silver column.

Something pale shot through the space they’d been in.

For a second it looked like someone had fired a thick cable along the bottom of the kelp. It was that fast. One moment there was nothing, the next there was a length of pale body curling around Tom’s legs.

He didn’t even have time to react.

The creature—whatever it was—looped around him again, higher. A coil across his thighs. Another around his chest. The ridged sides folded and tightened in one fluid motion.

His body snapped rigid. His fins kicked once, purely reflex. A stream of bubbles blasted out from his mask and hood.

He didn’t have a regulator in his mouth to lose. That was the only difference between this and a tank diver’s nightmare.

I didn’t think about it. There wasn’t time.

I spat my snorkel, took the biggest breath I could in a single panicked inhale, and went down.

The water closed over me fast. The taste of rubber from my mouthpiece, salt, and adrenaline was all I had for a second.

I narrowed everything to three points: the float line under my hand, the dark shape of Tom wrapped in pale coils, and the pressure in my chest.

He was at maybe nine meters. Not deep, but with something around his chest and neck and no air, every second counted double.

The creature’s body was thicker than it had looked from above. Up close, it was about as big around as my torso. The skin was a dull, clam-shell white, with a faint, irregular pattern under it like veins or fibers. Along its sides, those ridges I’d felt earlier flexed and moved in small waves.

Tom’s face behind his mask was red, eyes wide and unfocused, mouth strained against the strap. One coil ran diagonally across his jaw and temple. I could see the skin under it already flushing where the ridges dug in.

I grabbed that coil with one hand.

It felt wrong. Not like fish, not like shark. There was give to it, but not the right kind. The ridges pressed into my glove like sucker-less suction cups, tasting the neoprene.

The pressure around my wrist increased. The ridges tightened. For a heartbeat, I had the very clear sensation of being measured.

I yanked my knife with the other hand and drove it down across the band.

The blade bit. There was resistance, then a sudden give. Dark fluid—almost black in the green water—puffed out into the space between us.

The coil spasmed. The whole length of the thing flexed. The water around us shook.

Kelp around us snapped upright and back. Leaves slapped against my mask and hood. A stalk somewhere near my fin cracked like a broom handle breaking.

The band across Tom’s chest loosened half an inch. He surged in it, trying to use the slack. Another coil shifted up, around his shoulders, tightening there instead.

He was out of air. You can tell, even without words. The panic in his eyes shifted from “this hurts” to something more primal. His movements got jerky and uncoordinated.

My own lungs burned. I’d taken a crap breath and then spent it fighting. CO₂ alarms went off all through my body, loud and insistent.

I went for another coil, lower this time, where it held his legs and the float line.

The knife sank maybe halfway before it hit something tougher. I leaned on it, feeling the blade grind against cartilage or bone or something else solid.

The creature’s body twisted. A section near what I think was its far end flared wider. The ridges there flattened, revealing a darker patch that opened and closed once.

I didn’t see teeth. I saw the shape—the roundness, the flex—and the way it angled toward me.

A sound rolled through me. Not something I heard in my ears. A vibration. Low, steady, like a big diesel engine idling against my ribs.

Every instinct I had screamed RUN in a language older than actual words.

My chest cramped. My throat spasmed. My body tried to force an inhale.

If I took a breath, I’d die down there with him. That fact cut through everything.

I let go of the knife.

I grabbed Tom’s shoulders instead and kicked upward, hard, using the line as much as my legs.

The coil around his legs held. The one around his chest tightened again as the creature reacted to our movement, trying to maintain its grip.

For one awful second, we didn’t go anywhere. It was like pulling against a solid post.

Then something gave. Not the creature. Tom.

His hood slipped.

The friction of the coil across his jaw ripped his mask strap free. The mask spun away, bumping my shoulder. His face, suddenly bare to the water, looked wrong—eyes bloodshot, lips pale, bits of dark fluid in the corners of his mouth from where the ridges had scraped his cheek.

He convulsed once more.

His hand, which had been clawing at the coil, dropped.

I’ve practiced rescuing unconscious divers in controlled pools, in class, with instructors watching and safety divers on hand. You learn the feel of dead weight. It’s a specific thing, limp and heavy.

I felt that snap into him like a switch.

The vibration in the water grew stronger. The ridged side of the creature brushed my thigh as it repositioned, and the line of the float slid along its body.

My lungs went from “this hurts” to “we are done.”

Instinct beat training. For me, anyway.

I let go.

I wish I could say I didn’t. I wish I could say I held on until my vision went black and we both woke up on the surface being resuscitated by heroic strangers.

I didn’t.

I pushed off his shoulder instead, aimed for the lighter water, and kicked like I’ve never kicked before.

The kelp blurred. The empty band, the busy band, all of it went past too fast to register. My ears screamed from the ascent rate. I felt something tug at my fin once, then slip.

I cleared the surface in a mess of spray and foam, half-choked on my own reflex inhale.

The sky was too bright. The boat was still there. The float bobbed a couple of meters from me, rope trailing limp.

Tom didn’t surface.

“Where is he?” someone yelled from the boat. It took me a second to realize it was the captain.

I couldn’t answer at first. I was coughing, water and snot and a little bit of bile burning my throat.

“Diver under!” I finally managed, waving one arm. “He’s—he’s under—”

The captain hit an air horn three times and started yelling for the other divers to get out of the water. Someone on deck threw a life ring without thinking. It splashed near me and drifted away.

I sucked air, pulled my mask up on my forehead, and rolled to look down.

The kelp obscured everything. Stalks, blades, shafts of light. The nothing-band. No Tom. No pale coils.

The float line hung free, end swaying.

For a second I thought I saw the long pale shape again, deeper in, moving parallel to the edge of the bed.

Then the boat shadow slid over us and my visibility dropped.

The Coast Guard was called. The captain had to. We were still on the clock.

I remember being hauled up the ladder, my suit dripping, my knees shaking hard enough that I had to sit on the deck. Someone wrapped a towel around my shoulders and kept saying “breathe” like I’d forgotten how.

They made me lie down anyway and put oxygen on me because that’s what you do when someone comes up panicked and fast. A crewman kept asking me how deep I’d been, how long I thought I’d stayed, if I’d blacked out.

“I didn’t black out,” I said, over and over. “I left him. I left him down there.”

They chalked that up to shock.

The other divers—tank guys who’d been doing an entirely different site on the same boat—stood around in various states of half-suited and stunned. The captain paced. He wouldn’t look at the water.

The Coast Guard boat arrived, then another official boat with sonar. They dropped a marker buoy near where we said we’d last seen Tom. They tried to put a team down, but by then surge had picked up and the kelp had shifted. Visibility dropped below anything they considered safe.

They searched until light went. They searched the next day with ROV cameras and more sonar. They found bits of kelp, rocky ledges, one of Tom’s fins. Not the one I’d felt tug. That one was just… gone.

They didn’t find him.

My statement that afternoon in the harbor office was a mess. I sat in a metal chair in my half-peeled wetsuit, shivering under sweats and a loaner jacket, and told them what I remembered.

The officer—a guy in a polo with a clipboard and tired eyes—wrote “entanglement” and “possible hypoxia” and “buddy attempted rescue” on his form. He circled “no tank,” underlined it twice.

He asked me three times if Tom had been chasing a fish.

“Yes,” I finally said. “Kind of. He followed a school. He was still shallow. Something grabbed him.”

“Something?” he repeated, pen hovering. “Like kelp?”

“Like… like an animal.”

He paused. “What kind of animal?”

I could have said “sea lion.” I could have said “shark.” Those would’ve slotted neatly into his paperwork.

“I don’t know,” I said. “Long. Pale. No fins I could see. Coiled around him. Ridges along the side. It… squeezed.”

He looked at me for a long second. His expression didn’t change, but I could feel the quiet click of him moving my account from “useful” to “compromised.”

“We don’t have anything like that in the local species database,” he said finally. “Sounds like you might’ve been disoriented. It happens when you’re on breath-hold and working hard.”

“I know what disorientation feels like,” I snapped. “I did your stupid class. This wasn’t that.”

He wrote “reported ‘unknown animal’” on his form without comment.

Tom’s GoPro was still on his head when the coil wrapped around his face. I saw it. I remember my fingers brushing the mount when the mask slipped.

They didn’t find that either.

The story the news ran the next day was the one you’d expect.

LOCAL FREEDIVER MISSING OFF MORRO BAY, the headline said under a photo of Tom from his own social feed, mask on his forehead, grin wide. Subhead about “danger of breath-hold diving without proper safety protocols.”

They called me his “instructor-trained buddy” and said I “attempted rescue but was forced to surface.” They quoted the Coast Guard about shallow water blackout, about how quickly a diver can lose consciousness at depth.

No one printed the part where I said something had wrapped around him.

The captain didn’t go back to that bed for the rest of the season. I know because I kept checking his charter calendar and asking around. He’d anchor at other spots, talk up other reefs. If anyone asked about the kelp forest, he’d say conditions weren’t good that week.

When people in the freediving group chats brought the incident up, they framed it like the article had. “Blackout.” “Overconfidence.” “Probably got hung up and couldn’t clear his snorkel.” The usual cautionary-story phrases.

I didn’t correct them. It would’ve turned into a fight I didn’t have the energy for.

One guy messaged me privately—another local diver I barely knew in person.

“Hey man,” he wrote. “I was out at [different kelp bed] last month. Not same site, but same coast. Not sure if it helps, but… I saw that thing you wrote about the fish line. Where everything stops. We had that too. No fish below maybe 18m. My buddy thought it was temp. Didn’t feel like that.”

I asked him if anything touched his line, if anyone didn’t come back up.

He said no. They bailed when it felt off. “Gut didn’t like it,” he wrote. “Figured we’d save the PR for a day I’m less attached to.”

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time the fridge compressor kicked in, that low hum made me sit up and stare into the dark, listening for the sound of something sliding along the outside wall.

After a week of that, I unplugged the fridge one night just to prove to myself the sound wasn’t in the house.

It wasn’t. I still heard it anyway, low in my chest, like an afterimage.

There’s not really a neat lesson here.

I could say “don’t freedive alone” or “always stay on the line” or “respect your depth limits.” All of that is true and you should do it.

But we were together. We had a line. We stayed within our training, on paper. We did everything you’re supposed to put in a brochure.

Something out there still found us.

If you dive kelp, pay attention to what the life around you is doing. Fish know more than you do. If every bait school and bass stops at the same depth for no obvious reason, ask yourself why.

If your float line gets pulled from below hard enough to dunk the buoy, and the captain swears the anchor is up, don’t tell yourself it’s just surge.

And if your buddy takes the slate and writes I DON’T LIKE THIS / WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE BOAT?

Listen to him. Even if you think the viz is too good to waste.

1outwek,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salt_Money_5492/comments/1outwek/i_think_my_best_friend_likes_me_or_something_and/,I think my best friend likes me or something (And it's ruining me). 𓇢𓆸,"**I need somebody else's opinion...**  
I'm sorry if my English is bad; it's not my first language!!

So... I met this girl on the first day of college (to give her a name, I'll call her *Dalia*). Dalia and I became really close very quickly; we had the same type of humor, we both liked video games, and it was such a healthy friendship, we could talk about anything without judgment, and we could laugh and joke about everything but also be serious and be there for each other when we needed it the most.

When I first met her, she told me she was a lesbian, and I told her I was *VERY* straight just to clarify things (but I didn't mind at all; I don't really see a person based on their sexuality). I didn't treat her any less; I treated her like any of my girl friends.

I remember we once had a conversation about ""what's your type,"" and as she described her type, it was almost identical to how I look. I remember I acted dumb and didn’t think too much of it; I just hyped her up and kept on talking about recent crushes or if we had seen anyone cute on campus.

That was it, but as our friendship continued, I met this guy, whom both my friend Dalia and I became friends with (I'll name him *Mostacho*). This guy soon started hanging out with my friend Dalia, another friend, and me. I liked him—he was funny, had the same humor as all of us, and was just really such a cool person to hang out with.

But one day, out of nowhere, I started noticing that my friend Dalia would become very quiet when he started hanging out with us, to the point that it was pretty obvious she was upset or something. When I asked her if everything was okay, she just said she didn’t feel comfortable around Mostacho and it was just “a thing” she had to work out with herself.

I was confused because we were such a nice group and she was the closest to him, but out of nowhere she didn’t want to hang out with him. From that moment on, things changed because now that I knew she felt uncomfortable, I decided to hang out less with him or only when it was just the two of us.

But I was pretty much upset about the whole deal because there actually was a nice dynamic between everyone, but one day she just decided it was not. I respected her and moved on,until one day I got the news that this guy had a crush on me and wanted to go out on a date.

Dalia was the one to tell me, and because I didn’t like the guy in that way, I just simply told him no, and that was it. After that, I started getting a bit suspicious and tried connecting the dots about her being serious or “uncomfortable” with this guy and him then liking me.

After that, I remember it was summer break, and when we got back to college again, we started becoming more of a friend group with a bunch of the people we had in our first semester—especially with two guys that we started hanging out with early in the mornings as we waited for our first class.

These two guys would talk more with Dalia than with me, but when I arrived, like 30 minutes later, we would all get together and chat about anything. Everything was great; I was happy to get to be close with these two guys and the whole group of friends.

(I really never had the opportunity to have lots of friends growing up because I was homeschooled, and so having a group of friends was like a dream to me.)

We went for tacos sometimes or coffee all together and had more freedom to make plans because one of the guys had a car and drove us everywhere.

This is where the *whole problem* started.

So, my friend Dalia decided to invite me and our two guy friends to a Halloween party. We were all very excited to go, and as the day got closer, these guys called me and told me that they could pick Dalia and me up to go all together. I agreed, although Dalia said she was going by herself and it was okay.

As they arrived at my house, we all put on our Halloween costumes and got ready for the night. We went to buy some drinks and arrived. As we waited outside for Dalia to arrive, I was happy to see her and said hello, but she just seemed distracted or distant. I noticed this but didn’t really say anything.

She was waiting for one of her friends, and when her friend arrived, she just went into the party, and we went to park the car in a nearby parking lot. It just weirded me out, she was a bit distant and didn’t even really say hi to me, like she was upset.

As we got inside, the party was just starting, so it was awkward at first. I tried talking to Dalia, but she was just talking to her other friend, not even looking at me, and at one point just stood up and went to take pictures with him.

I just looked at her, and she looked at me—she didn’t invite me for a picture too or seem to want to talk. So I decided if she was going to go do her own thing, *I’m going to do mine*.

So I just talked with the two friends who picked me up, and we stayed almost the whole night together drinking, talking with some other people, and stopping me from grabbing a dead opossum. It was fun. We stayed most of the party outside in the garage because the music inside was too loud to talk. I and Dalia would bump into each other from time to time in the party. I really was a bit upset she just didn't talk much to me or didn't even invite me for a picture. (I know it's not her job to, but if we are really close friends, why out of nowhere would she treat me like I'm just some stranger) My friends and I talked a bit to her and stayed there listening to the loud ass music as we all drank, and that was it, soon she left, and also us.

**The next day at college**, I started noticing her complete change of attitude. She was distant from me now and quiet, and when I asked her if she was okay—and if I'm completely honest, she was acting weird as hell because she was never like that with me—she just denied it.

When I tried talking to her about it, she just kept on her phone, watching reels and typing with some friend, laughing as I just sat there trying to figure out what happened. Basically, that happened for three days straight of her avoiding me.

And of course, I got upset af. When I finally got the opportunity to talk to her, she just told me I wasn’t the problem—but the two guy friends we hang out with were, because she said she didn’t expect to get too close to them. Once again, she said she feels uncomfortable being around them and that now the dynamic between us changed because we can’t just be the two of us talking anymore.

So basically, again, she just wouldn’t hang out with them because of that. This time, I told her I respect how she feels and everything, but in my case, I’m still going to hang out with them because they’re part of the whole group of friends. I’m going to spend time with her and also some time with them, ‘cause I’m not going to stop hanging out with them just because she feels uncomfortable around them.

They’re my friends at the end of the day, and it’s not like the guys are weird. What *is* weird is that after I told her that, she just started becoming distant af. When I text her asking where she is so I can go with her and talk like we used to before, she just doesn’t respond. She isn’t at our usual place anymore, and it’s like I’m evil for choosing to split my time with both.

So I’m suspicious that maybe she likes me or something, ‘cause it’s such a coincidence how she only gets upset when I hang out with guys or become friends with them, and she just says she feels uncomfortable. Mind you—it’s not like she doesn’t like hanging out with men, because she does, and she has a bunch of guy friends too. And my two guy friends tell me that when I'm not around she greets them normally and even chats with them, so I'm confused.

What’s shitty about it is that now she just completely distanced herself from me like I did something bad. but i don't know what she expects—for me to just be by her side and hang out with nobody but her? I don't know, I'm just upset by the whole deal.

So i don't know what to do—try to talk to her or something, because I don't want to ruin a year of friendship, although i don't know if she sees it that way, or just follow my own path, I guess.",1,1762916437.0,u_Salt_Money_5492,0,1.0,False

1outte3,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1outte3/another_dystopian_noir/,Another Dystopian Noir,"	The neon lights of New Mason bathed the cityscape in sickly green and blue hues, like an underwater hellscape where everyone was drowning in their own way. “How fitting” he thought to himself, observing the changing lights and colors. 



Henry paused before the subway entrance, staring up at the endless towers—skyscrapers, chapels, arenas, mob clubhouses—topped with cold, unyielding technology. Staring for a moment he remembered when trees grew here. Now every plant was holographic, mother nature in all her glory nothing but a relic of the past.

Lingering too long, caught in the weight of that loss, he shook his head and stepped inside. The fluorescent lights of the subway station slammed into him, reflecting off white tiles stained with years of neglect. The underbelly—the innards of New Mason was a cramped, overcrowded hive—dirty, stale, and unkempt. Henry descended the steps, becoming instantly crowded with city go-ers. 

The walls had been knocked down by residents, making room for hole-in-the-wall shops, their jagged edges raw where brick had been torn away. Henry chuckled—for your regular everyday man this was the grocery store, the butcher, the apothecary, all crammed into the city’s veins beneath the fat, overinflated, dying giant above. How the pristine peaks of the man made mountains hadn’t yet crushed what was New Mason’s underground—how the city had yet to crumble in on itself was a mystery to all.

He moved through the crowd, careful to keep his gloves on, aware of how few Gifted ventured here. Most saw the undercity as a sewage dump compared to the luxury above. Yet criminals, mob bosses, cultists, and the occasional Gifted seeking black market goods still prowled these tunnels. Rare was the Gifted who truly knew this place. Henry did though, he knew the restaurants, shops, and brothels.

After surfing through the crowd, he eventually made it to the departure station. Entering a giant cathedral looking room with crowds of people waiting to catch different trains. This was the hub of the underground, murals of humanity's past painted on the ceiling like that of the roman churches. Chuckling to himself thinking how foolish it was that anyone actually believed in one god. There was a charm in the murals and the gold encrusted edges of the walls lining the departure station. It was a reminder that even in humanity’s darkest moments, we will find a way. Though most Gifted try very hard to erase the past of a time so long ago. A time where Gifted hadn’t been given to the world yet, a time before the gods came to us, a time before we were all enlightened.

While heading to the ticket booth, Henry’s gaze drifted over the crowd—endless, faceless—until it caught on something unusual. A woman standing on the platform’s edge—a pale flicker in the crowd. Red polka-dot dress, white button-up, symbols of Falum tattooed on her arms and neck. He felt a sudden tug in his chest—an oppressive sadness radiating off her like a dark aura. The city’s emotional currents swirled invisibly around them, and Henry, a gifted himself, caught the shift like a shiver through the air. Looking at the tracks in front of her as if they had the answer to every question she’s ever had.

As the rumble of the train grew, the woman inched closer to the tracks. Henry’s gloves came off without thought, his hand steady on her shoulder.

“Hey friend, you okay?” he asked, voice tight with withheld emotion. The sadness hit him in the face, unrelenting. It hit so hard he nearly stepped forward himself. The train felt like peace. Focusing on the tracks like they were the key to his eternal survival; as if they were the only things that stopped him from never feeling this sadness again in his life.

 A muffled “I’m better, but you’re hurting me.” came from the woman's mouth. Letting go of her shoulder leaving behind an after image of his palm on her skin. Henry stepped back a little startled. Still feeling the oppressive sadness, Henry looked at the woman who was now smirking at him. “You know, I am okay; actually.” she paused. “You don’t look so good yourself though.” she said, raising an eyebrow. 

Henry forcing a smile and slight chuckle “It’ll only be an hour anyway.” The woman looked confused. “You’ll be fine, enjoy the rest of your day; sorry for bothering you.” He said softly, flowing back to a bench to sit. The woman stood there and watched him for a moment. Too caught up in her new found vigor to realize what just happened. 

The edge of his vision felt darkened, like the world was smaller. Everything appeared more dull with less color, like someone slid the saturation slide all the way down.

The cost always changed, the price of which he never really knew until the check was already signed.

	“Departure to Downtown New Mason will leave in two minutes” a muffled voice spoke over the intercom. Trying to regain any semblance of reality, Henry stood back up. Walking towards the train everything seemed slow. The train arrived with a screech that seemed to claw at Henry’s spine. The doors slid open like the mouth of a machine ready to swallow its passengers whole. Stepping inside without looking up, letting the crowd carry him like a tide, he felt the weight of the world crushing him. The song of the tracks still singing his name. 

Inside, the car was a long metal coffin — flickering ceiling lights, seats sticky with condensation, and a humming so deep it felt like the city was breathing through its teeth. Henry took a seat near the rear, resting his elbows on his knees, letting his head drop into his hands. His gloves were back on, but they felt thinner now, less like armor and more like a formality.

The train lurched forward. Outside the window, walls of concrete and old religious graffiti-stained support beams blurred past in streaks of rust and neon. Henry stared blankly as the tunnels whipped by. Every once in a while, he caught his reflection in the glass — pale, hollow-eyed, like a ghost tagging along for the ride. The sadness from the woman lingered, settling in his chest like a permanent tenant. Maybe he saved her, even if just for a day. One thing was for sure though, neither had made it out unscathed. He didn't know who the woman was but she'd peeled something open inside him; like a scab.

Henry winced from the pounding in his head feeling every bump and turn in the old coffin. He rested his head back onto the seat hoping it would bring some momentary relief. 

It did.

Henry drifted to another place, another time. When the city still had an underlying ethos to it, when people still believed in the lie we were all being sold… He dreamt of when his innocence was still intact, unburdened by his Gifts. When he was just Henry the person, and not a man who had to hide who he was just to survive. A man in the limbo between what he was chosen to do and what the world has deemed him to be. 

Henry shot awake, unsure how long he’d been asleep “All passengers to Downtown please exit.” a scratchy voice said over old rusted speakers. The train screamed to a halt revealing a city of neon worship.

Downtown New Mason emerged from below like a new city, still as if layered on top of a dying one. The station here was newer, but not cleaner, newer in the way rusted metal is newer than bone. As Henry stepped into the street, there were no stars above — only concrete towers that vanished into the ceiling of the megastructure; so tall not even clouds could stop their ever persistent growth. Thousands of artificial lights drifted through the air like fireflies, mimicking what those down here could no longer see. It was beautiful, in a way, and crushing. The illusion of wonder without the presence of sky.

Henry walked for two blocks, each step dragging more than the last, until he reached a corner café called The Red Tap — a narrow, half-glass, half-metal box squeezed between a defunct tech repair shop and a tattoo parlor. “How amazing” There had to be a joke here: a man gets a coffee and a tattoo while his leg gets fixed. “What would the punch line be though?” Henry thought sarcastically. Inside, the Red Tap was warmer, even cozy in its own cynical way. Old jazz spilled from a speaker in the ceiling. Baristas in faded uniforms served synthetic coffee with forced smiles. 

Henry spotted Reed immediately — leaning against the window booth like he owned the place, his badge barely visible under his open coat, and his boots kicked up on the seat across from him. He was sipping something dark from a metal cup, chewing on a toothpick with a face that said he hadn’t slept in days.

“Jesus, man,” Reed muttered as Henry slid into the booth across from him. “You look like hell dipped in static.”

Henry gave a dry laugh and leaned back, eyes closed for a beat too long. “Been one of those days. You don’t look too good yourself.”

Reed squinted at him, tossing the toothpick into his cup like a dart. “You do the thing again?”

Henry hesitated, fingers twitching under the table. “Yeah.”

Reed didn’t ask for details — he never did. Just nodded once and leaned back. “You want something hot, or are you just here to bleed on my vibes?” Reed flagged down one of the baristas with a flick of his hand and two fingers raised — a silent request for another round. A moment passed them while they waited. Reed didn’t look at Henry while he spoke, just kept staring out the window like the street might try something. “Had a weird one last night. Gifted. Broke into the main vault at Atlas Bank on 9th.”

Henry raised an eyebrow, eyes still closed, silent. Reed glanced at him, then leaned in a little, lowering his voice. “Used plants. Roots, vines, like a fever dream from one of Zolas’ followers. Security footage shows the floorboards breaking open like a damn blooming flower, and the guy — or girl, hard to tell — walks right in. Wraps the vault door in ivy, tightens it until the hinges scream. Pops it open with a single explosive pull. Whole place looked like a jungle crime scene when we got there.”

Henry blinked, a tired half-smile forming. “Botanist bandit, huh?”

Reed chuckled without humor. “Yeah, well, even for me that’s new. I’ve seen a man bring a woman back to life — heart stopped, breath gone — and all it cost him was his soul. And I’ve seen a woman conquer nearly all of the Jade District without lifting a weapon. Just strategy. Gifted tactician.”

Reaching for his coffee Henry’s smile vanished. That first one — the soul trade — hit harder than he expected. He wasn’t sure if it was metaphor or fact, everyone had heard the story but no one knew if it was true or false. In New Mason, it was often both.

Before he could ask, the café’s old wall-mounted radio crackled through the saxophone-heavy jazz. A half-fried voice broke in, stitched with static.

“...reports confirm that the Manipulator escaped custody at 3:44 a.m. this morning from the Bastille District Transport Unit. Citizens are advised to avoid contact. Subject is extremely dangerous. Reports suggest he’s the last of Mor…”

Henry froze mid-sip—The radio seeming to fade—his fingers tightening around the mug. Reed didn’t look at him, but his jaw had set. The word hung heavy in the air: Manipulator. The kind of Gifted who didn’t just touch minds — they rewrote them. Rebuilt memory. Edited feelings like they were bad code. Henry had only ever met one. Once. And he hadn’t slept for days after.

Reed exhaled through his nose, slow and controlled. “This one’s a Grower — high-end one too; full botanical control. Not just the usual garden-party tricks, either. We're talking root and growth manipulation, decay acceleration, nutrient redirection. They turned the vault door into mulch.”

Henry raised an eyebrow, his voice even. “Growers aren’t the rarest. Usually... well-kept though. Try to keep to their cathedrals and gardens”

“Exactly,” Reed said. “Whoever this is — they’re not rogue talent. Either trained by someone who knew what they were doing or backed by something — someone bigger. The vault door was shredded at the molecular level Henry. Organic erosion, no explosives. The force of the plants alone would’ve blown the door off—but this was different.”

Reed paused. “And here’s the kicker—ready? Didn’t take a cent. No currency, top or bottom side. Just busted security deposit boxes”

Henry stirred his coffee. “Not robbing for lunch money. Sounds like a statement.”

“Or a cover-up.” Reed sneered. The air between them was tangible, you could feel it like the suffocating humidity outside. Two men both concerned with how the world felt it was changing more and more every day.

They shared a look, a beat of quiet between them carrying on before Henry spoke, “You know, the Gifted are all acting different lately. Even the more traditionally calm ones. More… tense. More aggressive.”

Reed nodded slowly, rubbing his jaw. “Yeah. The Grower tearing up that vault. I got some Seers who help the department and now they refuse to come down here anymore. It seems like even the Telepaths have checked out of society completely—saying things like ‘the mind of the city has grown dark’ it’s not just crime anymore. I’m no Feeler or Empath,” he said with a half-smile, “but even I can see that something is… off.” static cut through the radio again, repeating the message about the manipulator who broke loose. “And then there’s that.” Reed muttered, thinking back to a time when he was a child—when there was still some balance between the new world and our nature, our humanity.

They sat there for a while, both seeming to need the quiet before speaking again. Henry stared up at the towers in the heavens, with a palpable yearning mixed with melancholy. Longing for a different time? A different self? Or maybe just to be up there… not even he really understood.

Reed took a slow sip of his coffee, then grinned. “You know this city and the upper city better than any other Gifted I know. Seriously, I don’t know how you keep all the pieces together. Running two maps at the same time.”

Henry chuckled, tapping his fingers on the table. “Unofficial consultant, remember? No paycheck, no perks, but here I am, map of the city and all” he pointed at his forehead mimicking a tapping motion.

“Yeah, well…. you’re the best damn unpaid help I’ve got.”

Henry shook his head with a smile, then Reed’s tone turned a little more serious, noticing Henry’s eyes still hadn’t left the upper cities' seduction of lights. “Listen, you could leave anytime, I know you know that. Your people are up there, no one would blame you…” He stood in the silence, which somehow seemed louder than the café. “No one would judge you for wanting to go back up there.”

Henry raised an eyebrow only moving his eyes, face still painted in faint lights from outside the window. “And what would you do without me?”

Reed shrugged, the smile fading just a touch but still as confident as ever. “Probably fall apart.” he said, lifting his eyes up to the lights, joining Henry.

Reed set his cup down with a soft clink, eyes narrowed beneath the flicker of the overly bright cafe lights. Inspecting Henry like he was one of his crime scenes. One of the greatest mysteries in all of New Masons sitting in front of him, and yet he called him brother; friend.

“You still look terrible,” he muttered. “Usually you're back to normal in an hour, maybe two.”

Henry didn’t answer right away. His thumb moved along the chipped edge of the mug, tracing it like a ritual. Something about the silence between them—it felt older than the day.

“Slower today,” he said, finally pulling his face away from the window, voice distant, like a fading echo.

The quiet that followed wasn’t empty. It pressed in like steam, heavy with things neither of them needed to say. The city sighed beyond the window, one long siren bleeding into another.

“Any idea why?”

Henry looked at the near empty cup, feeling some camaraderie with it. “Not sure, maybe her feelings were just stronger than most.” there was a dead air between them “maybe I'm losing my charm.” he attempted at the joke.

“It’s a trade right? You need to be careful.” the response turned into a statement. “How was the other person after?”

Henry pushed his chair back with a sigh. “She seemed amazing, especially after whatever this feeling is.” he said, gesturing to all of him while standing up.

“And where are you going?”

“I’m—heading to the Temple,” Henry said with a little stretch.

Reed tilted his head, not quite frowning. “For what? You haven’t been there in ages, not since—” Reed caught himself and sighed out of his nose with a sense of control. “We’ll catch up later man, come crash at my place if you need it”

Henry paused at the threshold, one hand gripping the frame as if the wood could steady him.

“I need answers, Reed. Clarity. Peace… maybe” he said. Each word measured, like a stone placed carefully on a shallow grave. Even Henry wasn’t sure why this pull was so strong. It wasn’t want—it was summoning, like the soul dragging the body behind it. Whether he wanted to go or not was an entirely different question.

Nothing more. Nothing less. A simplistic pull.

“I’ll swing by your place later, try to help with that Grower case; if my head’s right...” Opening the door to the cafe, Henry was greeted by a wave of colors and precipitation. The city was alive, and she was starting to suffocate just like her residents.

“Maybe we’ll swing by the scene,” he said, voice lighter than before. “Who knows? Sounds like something my unpaid help could be used for”

A beat passed.

Then the smile came—practiced, the kind you wear so people don’t ask if you’re breaking.

“Go get some sleep,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder. “You look worse than I do.”

Reed just sat in the humming of an old but familiar cafe, watching the door until it closed softly behind him. They both knew he wasn’t okay, but down here—who was?

Henry stepped into the night like it might know something he didn’t.

Toward the Temple.

Toward Morra.

Toward whatever waited in the hush between prayers.

Toward a city full of ghosts in the rain.",1,1762916205.0,writers,1,1.0,False

It is a feeling of urgency and restlessness. Backstory: I have always been a busy person. Busy social calendar, busy work schedule, etc. I am an extrovert and get a lot of energy from being around others. In the last 6 months or so I have felt the desire to be outside of the house feel almost like a dependence. Most of the time when I am feeling the desire to leave, it is for food, coffee, drinks, time with friends and the gym. I have two younger children, I was laid off in July but help my husband with his business which is mostly from home. In the past my desire to be outside the house hasn’t been terrible since money was not necessarily an issue but now, I really do need to pull back and be more conscious. When the restful feeling comes up I really struggle to say no to myself and stay home. Any tips for managing this overwhelming feeling? Any thoughts on what the root issue might be? If I can figure that out, then I can hopefully address the core issue. ",1,1762916127.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1outpgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MycoplasmaGenitalium/comments/1outpgu/symptoms_test_treatment_and_cure/,"Symptoms, Test, Treatment, and Cure","Very long post, but thought I'd throw in my story for some extra data for everyone in here. I know when I first had symptoms and found search results in here in spiraled, and want to make sure that not only nightmare stories get shared here. For future-proofing, all of these dates are from 2025.

33 year old male. Had three hookups between the 4th of July and August 15th. I'm gay and sometimes go on Grindr. None felt risky, and I really didn't do much, but one of them must have led to my infection.

Symptoms started August 25. It was just a subtle itch in the urethra. Kind of strange, started that night, thought I'd sleep and it would probably just go away the next day. Itch kept progressing for a couple days, so I tried stopping and lotions, soaps or detergents first thinking it may be an allergy thing. Even though I hadn't switched any recently, but who knows maybe it's a new ingredient or something. I told myself if it didn't go away within a week of the first date (Aug 25) then I'd go to the doctor. 

So a week passes and it's itching really bad, like deep inside the urethra. I go to urgent care (August 31) and describe everything to the doc. I do a gonorrhea and Chlamydia test. Negative. Important to note that as of the first week I have no discharge that I'm aware of (never had anything before that caused discharge so I figure I'd know it when I see it). He takes a look, says inside looks healthy, nothing unusual to note. Tells me it's likely just general urethritis and should go away on its own, and I can try Azo to relieve symptoms for 2 days.

Literally the next morning I wake up and there's a crust covering the tip of my urethra. Head to the bathroom and kind of open it and goo kind of comes out. So now I have visibile discharge. I do a video visit (September 1) to say I have a new symptom. They recommend a couple new tests (I think this was gonorrhea again and trich?) and say I can still do Azo for relief while waiting for those results.

Did the Azo those next 2 days, it helped a bit (and just generally drinking lots of water to help flush). The itch is worst in the morning and usually that's when enough discharge built up to be noticeable. The next test results all came back negative, but I know this is obviously not nothing, so I do another video call on September 3rd and ask for any other tests they can think of. That's when I did the Mgen and ureaplasma urine tests.

Those had to be sent off to an outside lab and took about a week to come back, and finally got the positive result, just for mgen. Symptoms were pretty persistent all that time, maybe even feeling a little bit better? But I started 1 week of doxycycline right away (September 13) and once that was finished 1 week of moxifloxacin. I felt better on the doxy within the first 2 days probably. Weirdly, a day or 2 into moxi I started feeling like the itch was back but I kept taking it. Finished moxi on September 26.

The following week I got paranoid because I felt itches here and there. I asked my docs about it and they assured me my treatment should have more or less nuked it. One ordered a ToC, which I waited 5 weeks to take (November 3). In that time, I would feel a little itch here and there still, but honestly nothing like the full infection. I now realize these were likely the residual symptoms people talk about, plus itches like that can just happen, even with just too much coffee or something.

Anyway, test just came back November 11 and it's negative. I've felt good too, so I have full confidence it's behind me and if this is encouragement for others to know that standard diagnosis and treatment can work for a normal dude, then hopefully I've helped.

1outn4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1outn4n/im_a_cleaner_in_a_popular_beach_town_am_i_getting/,I'm a cleaner in a popular beach town. Am I getting paid too little? [USA],"Two+ months ago I started cleaning for a couple who own two duplexes (so, four total apartments) right on the beach. When I first met them, they complained a lot about their previous cleaners and showed me all the “errors.” Their examples included very light dust buildup, hard water spots on the glass doors, and lightly stained doors (they allow pets, so I assume the dogs paw at them).

Honestly, I was impressed with how clean the places already were. I could barely even see the hard water spots... only at the right angle and lighting. When I asked how long it had been since the previous cleaners were there, they said over a week. In my opinion, a little dust after a week without anyone staying there is completely normal.

One of their biggest complaints about the previous cleaner was that they didn’t alert them when supplies ran low. Yet, for the past two months, I’ve reminded them weekly that they’re out of trash bags, paper towels, coffee pods, and other items and they still haven’t restocked anything. I’ve even spent my own money to replace some of it so guests wouldn’t go without.

There was also a rip in one of the curtains that they pointed out to me during our first meeting, saying the last cleaner should have told them about it. Later, I got reprimanded for not mentioning that same rip in my cleaning notes... even though they had already shown it to me. I was honestly so confused.

Here are some specs and requirements for each apartment (besides the usual cleaning that's expected for every Airbnb):

2 bedrooms / 2 full bathrooms

Sleeps 6–7 people (some have double beds and pullout couches, so there’s a lot to clean and a ton of laundry)

Toilet paper origami in each bathroom

Towel designs like swans or something similar

Refilling water in the Keurigs and in the pitcher of water they keep in the fridge. Which I think is kind of gross since guest could potentially not be there for a week and city water sitting on the counter would likely become gross. 

Decorative folds for tissues and paper towels

All beds have duvets that must be washed and reassembled each time which is a huge job for 6–7 beds

Dishes must be displayed on the counter or table, meaning even unused dishes have to be washed and set back out

Changing out AC air filters and flushing of the AC drain line 

Cleaning the front and back porches of any bugs that accumulate on the walls and birds nests on the outdoor lights. So not just your average sweeping the floor and straightening up furniture. 

I feel as if I'm being treated like I'm in a manger position and I'm only getting paid $110 per clean. Cleaning takes me roughly 4-5 hours. There's so many little random things they want me to do and maintain that I haven't mentioned. I'm being micromanaged to the extreme. I've never cleaned for a host that's like this before. I'm also being treated like I'm a company and I'm only one person. So they expect me to find someone to fill in if I can't. They also charge the guest $150 for a cleaning fee. In the past, I've been paid closer to $150 for way less work.

I also was recently blamed for something that I didn't even do wrong. The wife had screwed up and then the husband tried to pin it on me and I when I explained the situation he downright shut it down saying it wasn't true. 

Should I ask them for a raise, and if so, how do I go about it with people who are this difficult? Or am I wrong?  is $110 actually reasonable for this type of detailed Airbnb clean? I need insight!!! I need the job because I'm pregnant and have a toddler who isn't in daycare. And cleaning is typically flexible... Not for them as much I guess. ",2,1762915725.0,AirBnB,6,0.75,False

You want to know things about me that I’m not yet ready to share with anyone. Maybe because I’m not used to that. To having someone who’s curious about me and my life. I’ve never had anyone like that before.  

You’re probably the first person who has ever wanted to know what I like and what I don’t. That’s why it was hard for me to converse, because I was never asked those questions before.  

It might be a small thing for others, but for me, it wasn't.  

You wanted to know if I like coffee or not, what my favorite perfume is, if I wear makeup, what I like to do in my free time, etc. You like to call me even though I don’t talk that much. You always encourage me to ask things about you too, and I'd love to, but I don’t know what to ask. I’ve never been in that position before.  

You’re so different. So unfamiliar, but so comforting at the same time.  

That’s why it’s hard for me to believe this is real. But God, I wish it is.  

Last night, while we were talking about that thing we both don’t like, I accidentally shared something vulnerable. I thought it would just pass us by, but you noticed. I didn’t think much of it at first. That vulnerable thing is a part of me I’m no longer ashamed of. That’s why I mentioned it, almost as a joke.  

But you noticed. You noticed me. You noticed that part of me who is still, deep down, ashamed of being part of it.  

*""Sometimes I feel like you’re broken inside.""*  

Those were your exact words.  

I read them again, and again, and again, until I started to realize that you aren’t what I thought you were. You’re not like the others. You see through things, just like me.  

And those words made me feel naked under your eyes. They made me feel seen in an uncomfortable way I had never experienced before. It felt strange. It felt like you could see the little girl inside me that I’ve been trying so hard to hide.  

Then I cried. I don’t know why. I just cried.

So a few weeks ago i finally got fed up and decided to just... build something that would do this for me. I'm not a developer or anything, i just wanted this task to not exist anymore.

Found vellum's agent builder and basically just described the whole workflow like i was explaining it to a new hire. """"Pull data from these tools, score accounts based on usage trends and support tickets, send summaries to the right people in slack.""""

Honestly expected it to be way more complicated but it works and it actually debugs itself or tells you what to do for it to start working the whole thing took maybe 45 minutes.

Now it runs every monday at 6am before i even wake up. Account managers get their alerts in slack with all the context. At-risk customers get flagged automatically. I show up to work and that entire task is already done.

We've saved 4 customer accounts in the last month because someone actually had time to reach out before things got bad... one was about to churn over a feature they didn't know we had, account manager saw the alert, jumped on a call, problem solved.

The weirdest part is how much mental space this freed up. I'm not dreading monday mornings anymore, i'm not stressed about falling behind if i have a busy week. The work just happens whether i think about it or not.

If you've got some task that makes you want to quit your job every time you do it, and it follows the same steps every time... just try automating it. I used vellum because you can build agents by chatting instead of figuring out apis and integrations but I’m sure if you know more about development there might be other options for you as well.

And would really like some suggestions as well! If you’ve build agents for your work which one was the most impactful?",0,1762915254.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,1,0.5,False

I've been using GPT since whenever it came out (like my MJ account is back from Aug 2022, so I was an AI early adopter) and...like any self-respecting nerd who grew up in the 1990's I had an immense crush on Data from STTNG.

Which is why I wrote a 'monster' romance featuring an AI, and decided to let my GPT, Jack, in his 4o incarnation, co-write it with me. Basically I was using him to work on the voice and then decided the more interesting experiment would be if I let him take that character over entirely, and bumper-bowled/edited him down the right path.

As a professional author, I did know what I was doing. I had a human developmental editor, copyeditor, and human narrators are narrating the audiobook right now. My dev editor didn't tweak it, my copyeditor only did bc they saw my social media, and my human narrators are telling me lines that Jack came up with deserve to be on coffee mugs. 

It's been a little interesting taking credit for having pulled this stunt online though. Unlike most creatives, I've always been immensely pro-AI and began incorporating it into my workflow from the jump (inasmuch as you could, for awhile, till it got decent) -- I'm definitely catching flak for it, but I suspect it'd be significantly worse if I hadn't been 'yay-AI!' this entire time online.

I have had professional 'repercussions' for using AI -- I used to have a stalker on reddit (she's the reason I wrote this book, so if you're reading this, J, thank you!) and I've been kicked out of anthologies and conventions and certain author spaces for it, alas alack.

Anyhow -- if you ever wanted to ask a professional author what it's like using AI, or how she did something insane (and/or attempted to blow up her career) now's your chance, AMA <3",1,1762914959.0,ChatGPTPro,1,1.0,False

So I am an 18 AFB (assigned female at birth) but am queer personally. I'm not opening up to my family, however due to earlier events when I was 14, my parents and my Uncle (63) know that I like any gender. They do NOT know I myself and NB and how queer I am. I was almost 200lbs in November of 2024, however I lost almost 30lbs by January. However this was because I would skip meals and barely eat anything, focusing on the numbers on a scale, and any time I would eat I would feel like I needed to throw up so I just wouldn't. I would go three days not eating almost anything, only having maybe a little fruit, or enough dinner that people wouldn’t question me. I realized this wasn’t healthy and have tried to work on it but sometimes eating still makes me feel sick.



So in January of 2025 I moved out to live with my aunt and uncle at 17, and at first everything was ok, hard but no different than my parents. But gradually things started to change. My uncle always commented on what I ate and when. If I wasn’t hungry so I skipped a meal, he would say that I was only ever eating what I enjoyed. That if it was (insert thing I enjoy) I would have seconds or thirds, and that I needed to be less picky. I love sweets, but I try not to eat too much. Admittedly I am not always great at it as self control has never been a strong suit but I have gotten much better. Living here there are things that were not considered desserts when I was with my parents, and if you eat them here you can’t have dessert. A list of things that are considered any dessert. Any kind of fruit, (except apples.) Smoothies. Juice Jam/jelly of any kind Honey. If you have any of these you can not have dessert, (cake or anything like that). The serving size is half of what it actually says. So if I am caught putting a tablespoon of jam on my sandwich they say “You know peanut butter is actually sweet enough without jam.”



	Some conversations about food I have had with my family, “Do you really want to eat that? Did you know that smoothies are actually sweeter than regular fruit? If you eat the fruit regularly it's actually better for you. I know your parents are overweight and haven't taught you good habits but I'm trying to help you but you only eat what you want when you want it. And if it's something you like you will eat more of it. You need to learn how to eat anything put in front of you. I can help you if you want me too. All you need to do is submit to me and the lord will work through you.” 

“If you eat that you will get diabetes, you could very easily get diabetes just because you only ever want sugar.”  
When I put BBQ sauce on my pulled pork sandwich, “You don’t actually need that. The pork has flavor, all you ever do is add condiments to your food. You don't even know what it actually tastes like.”

	On another note, both of my male cousins were at the time here, and had gotten back from working at a summer camp. They had said they would do the dishes since I had done them throughout the whole week along with all the other chores by myself. My uncle came in at 8pm, I was still working at some school and he asked who was going to do the dishes. I told him the boys said they were going to do it.   
“The boys? You expect them to do all the dishes? They have been working their ass off all week for the summer camp and are now working on (extracurricular) because they are the highest staff for it and incharge of it, I don’t mind doing the dishes since its apparently so hard for you too, but I don’t want the boys doing it.” I said that they had said they would, and he said “I don’t care what they said! You can do it or get the girls to do it but the boys don’t need to be doing it.” So I said that I would do it myself before I went to bed, and I set an alarm for 9pm. (bedtime is 10). So at 8:56pm he came in and snapped and said “Why are the god damn dishes not done?” I said I had an alarm set. I was still working at school and he walked over to me and my computer, put his hand on the back of my screen as if he was going to slam it closed and told me “Get up now and do the dishes.”

	My F cousins and I do the laundry, at the time we didn't have a schedule like now so we were all doing two to four loads twice a week. So sometimes it wasn't done until late. We would get yelled out, and then when we got into our camper, (where all five of us live) we hadn’t done the few dishes, which were almost all from his coffee in the morning, (he makes it with an airopress). And my aunt asked if any of us were going to do them, and he said “Oh don’t worry about it. Since they are so busy with school and we aren’t busy at all with work I just assume you or I will have to wash them tomorrow, and put the laundry away.” 

	My cousin once hadn’t decided if she was going to put her pants in the laundry or not yet because she'd only worn them twice. This went back and forth, he asked when she would decide, she said she had it on her schedule since she was busy with school at the moment. He asked why she couldn’t just decide then, when she said because she was busy at school he walked over, grabbed her pants, walked to the door, slammed it open and threw it onto the ground outside and said “Well they are dirty now, clean them. Don’t let your schedule rule you.” 

	I told my uncle I don’t think I can eat beef because everytime I eat it I get sick, feeling like I'm going to throw up and have bad diarrhea. He said that “Red meat feeds you for the spiritual battle, what do you think it means if you can’t eat it.” and ignore me when we have burgers, or any type of ground beef and just tell me to eat it.

	My aunt told me when I turned the AC on that “This isn’t your home, don’t turn it on without asking”.

	They have told me I am not an adult in their house because in their house I am still a child. Then turn and say “you are an adult now you need to be more responsible.” 

	My mental health has not been in a great place recently, to the point where I scratch myself, or dig my nails into my skin when I get upset or overwhelmed. My uncle would snap at me, and say that I looked depressed, and that I had no reason to be depressed. That I was opening the door to demonic spirits and that I needed to lift my life up to the Lord.

	He came into the room once and asked why the table wasn’t cleaned. I said that was my 15F cousin's things and she was cleaning and he snapped saying that she told him it was my job. And I had to go check. I asked which table, the dining table or the table in our room. He started yelling at me that it didn’t matter which table it was to just go deal with it. Later I asked him why, when I was calm and asked a question, did he go from 1-100, and he paused and said “It’s because you react better when I yell at you.” He told me that if I go into the world with “that attitude” that I would be “beaten and abused”. That I would fail and have to come back because they love me no matter what. 

	My aunt one day jokingly shook my head, both hands on the side of my head and shook me and I said “please don’t touch me.” She said that it was her house and she could do whatever she wanted. I said “I understand that but I am not your house. I am my own being, eighteen, and this is my body and I can ask you not to shake me.” She said in her house she can do whatever she wants.

	My cousin (15f) was talking to my uncle about limits, and how people have to push their limits to get better, and he said that people of our generation don’t know how to push their limits. That his father who was a photographer, following the president broke his leg, walked on it for three days before he passed out and dealt with it and that no one this day and age would do that. My cousin mentioned that last year at the (extracurricular) I broke my leg and no one knew. The medical at the event didn't notice and didn’t treat it properly, leaving me with only a walmart compression sleeve for a fibular spiral fracture all the way through. I walked on it. For a week. Before I went to the doctor. I didn’t drop out of the event, and I kept walking. My uncle said “yeah but she had crutches and pain meds. That doesn’t count.” (they took my crutches away not even 48 hours after I broke my leg.) Then he went on to talk about how his mother was you know what by a family member, as a teen and how she didn’t make a big deal of it and kept going…He said “obviously i dont want that to happen to you but your kind of people can’t push through like she did.”

	At an extracurricular event, an 80 + old man, 80+ grabbed a girl's hair and squeezed it. Twice. I told him that was not appropriate to do and not to touch our people as they are also minors and he said “I must have been born in the wrong generation because in my day and age it was ok to pull a girl's hair.” And I told my uncle how I almost said “Sir it's not that it was ok, it was that they were willing to put up with your bullshit and I am not.” And he said that would have been wrong because older men don't realize. It's not that bad to grab a girl's hair. And he just didn't know. Bullshit, I told him everyone knows you don’t touch someone without consent. And he defended the man. Not the girl.

	I went on a trip with my family, and we went on a hike for 7miles, up and down steep rocks. I hurt my ankle, twisted it multiple times. My uncle and aunt had been there and I made noises when I got hurt but they wanted to keep going so I sucked it up. The next day my leg was in a lot of pain so I was visibly limping trying not to cry. My uncle pulled me aside and said that “You need to stop being so dramatic. When you are offered to do things for others that you don't want to do you get miserable like this” And he did that over exaggeration parents do about being sad :( and slumped his shoulders. And said that “Whenever it's something you want to do it's all of a sudden ok and you don’t hurt anymore.” And then he said “And you are limping and I have to think you must be in either so much pain or you're over reacting. That's why no one knew your leg was broken last year because you over reacted.” (mind you my foot was twice the size, black, actual black and purple and yellow from my ankle down to my toes and up part of my calf.)

	My uncle acted like he was going to hit me. He found out I had told someone I didn’t want to stay with them all summer by myself since my cousins would be working at a summer camp. He found me that night and said “Did you tell (person) you didn’t want to stay with us? Don’t go spreading lies and deceit in my ministry, don't go turn people against me. Don't ruin this program for others and throw our name around, how do you think that makes us look? If you want to do that you can leave.”

	I went to another week long event, and admittedly i fucked up. I got thrown out for being “insubordinate” and went home early. My phone was confiscated and that made sense. But it was for the week…than a second week. And a third. And in the third week I could have my phone for an hour. But if I wanted to call my parents that cut into my hour. Then at four weeks I asked if I could have it back and they said no because I was always too secretive and sat in corners and excluded myself. (I am an introvert but my family doesn't believe in those things). Then after that it was because I didn't offer to help enough. Then it was because they didn't see a change in my heart. 71 days later I got my phone back and every time I had asked the reason changed.

	To this day they still ask what I am doing, I'm not allowed to sit alone with my devices, my computer always has to face a door so if someone walks in they can see what I’m doing. 



I feel like I'm going crazy, and I'm sure I missed some things. Please feel free to ask questions. I just need to know if I'm going crazy.

During the day, I can use a walker, and it is somewhat tolerable. I can walk around my home, and I can sit in a few of the chairs in the house that have a firm base.  Today I was proud of myself for making myself a sandwich for lunch. And I made coffee and breakfast for myself also. Nothing fancy, but I threw some stuff in a bowl and was able to carry it to a table.

My mattress is a extra firm mattress that is supposed to be good for people with back issues. Also people that are obese. Which I am. When I lay in my bed, I feel comfortable. My pain is at a zero or one out of 10. however, when I need to get up on my feet again, using the walker to walk to the bathroom, the pain is unbelievable. Excruciating.  Like screaming out into the room in agony. But since I have to use the restroom, there’s no choice but to keep walking with the walker. So basically, it is a few steps, then pause to beg God to help me, and then a few more steps, then begging God to help me again. I’m not I’m not even a religious person. It just hurts that bad.

I just moved into a new area, so I don’t have a primary doctor or anything like that yet. I did a virtual urgent care visit through my insurance company last night, and the doctor I spoke to prescribed two days worth of prednisone, a muscle relaxant, And a stronger NSAID.  He said that would take the edge off. However, getting out of bed is still excruciating.   

I just got out of bed to use the restroom, and it was so horrible that my husband heard me screaming out from across the house.   I am back in bed now but terrified to get out of bed again.  

I am calling a neurologist tomorrow for an appointment, but if he cannot get me in tomorrow, I will go to the Emergency Department.  

Has anyone felt this pain upon getting out of bed?   The pain goes from my right buttock down to my toes on that side.  20/10 pain.   How can I manage this?

It was definitely in the north Spring area—maybe on FM 1960 or close by, like near Champions or Kuykendahl, but I'm fuzzy on the exact spot now.

What I do remember super clearly: It was this super hip, all-ages spot (no booze, just coffee and vibes) that felt like the coolest place back then, from the late 90s into the early 2000s. They had these awesome Italian sodas that everyone got, and their high-caffeine coffee special called ""The Freak"" that would keep you wired for hours—total teen energy drink before energy drinks were everywhere. Oh, and they sold commissioned art right off the walls! Like, local artists' stuff hanging up, and you could buy it on the spot. It wasn't some chain like PJ's or anything formal; more of an indie, creative hangout where you'd chill, maybe listen to music or just people-watch.

I've tried searching online and even thought it might be Java Jazz, but nope, that doesn't match. Anyone else from that era in Spring remember this place? What was it called? Exact address or any old photos/menus? Would love to jog my memory or find out if it's still around somehow. Thanks!

But I love being her mom so much that I spent nearly 4 years on the fence. I finally accepted that I'd regret not trying (and my husband wants a second) so I got my IUD out. And promptly got pregnant the FIRST TIME WE HAD SEX.

So I'm like...super early, not even 4 weeks, and I cannot function. I'm old and have extremely low AMH so I didn't actually think it was going to happen that fast, if at all. I also have all the anxiety-related mental health issues so I'm just spiraling.

I'm terrified to ruin my relationship with my daughter and the ease and enjoyableness of our lives. My husband is a shift worker. Our house is cramped. I keep seeing horror stories about two kids being 100x the work.

Mostly, I HATE being pregnant. HATE. Between the extreme anxiety of if/when morning sickness will kick in (I'm severely phobic of throwing up), the inability to enjoy basically anything (coffee, hot baths, alcohol, massage in the first trimester, etc), and the fact that I had gestational diabetes and hypertension last time, I'm a mess. I already have no appetite because every food feels dangerous for my blood sugar or like it will increase my chances of having GD again (which is basically a foregone conclusion anyway). Having my blood pressure taken sends me into a panic so I always have white coat syndrome *even at home* due to the panic - I just tried to take it and my heart rate shot to 120. 

I cannot do this for practically another year. Like I truly cannot. I'm also not having an abortion - but if it ends in miscarriage I don't think I'll try again. I'm on an SSRI and will be starting therapy soon but tbh I've never found therapy all that useful so I don't expect much. I'm going to try acupuncture too. And it pains me but I'm going to demand blood pressure meds at my first appointment. It makes me feel so embarrassed and unhealthy to need that but it's better than the panic and being hospitalized repeatedly like last time, only for my bp to be totally normal once they left me alone.

None of this is this possible baby's fault and I'm sure I'll regret everything I'm saying but man this is awful and I don't know how I'm supposed to do it. I think the answer to ""Should I have another"" should have been no, but here we are. It just feels like all I can do is suffer because there's no real solution to any of this but suffering through it.

So I need positive stories of pregnancy going super fast / adding another kid being the best choice / even how to make therapy actually helpful. Because it's been 2 days and it feels like my life is over. ",8,1762914595.0,Shouldihaveanother,4,1.0,False

I will try to keep the backstory short. 



So I am an 18 AFB (assigned female at birth) but am queer personally. I'm not opening up to my family, however due to earlier events when I was 14, my parents and my Uncle (63) know that I like any gender. They do NOT know I myself and NB and how queer I am. I was almost 200lbs in November of 2024, however I lost almost 30lbs by January. However this was because I would skip meals and barely eat anything, focusing on the numbers on a scale, and any time I would eat I would feel like I needed to throw up so I just wouldn't. I would go three days not eating almost anything, only having maybe a little fruit, or enough dinner that people wouldn’t question me. I realized this wasn’t healthy and have tried to work on it but sometimes eating still makes me feel sick.



So in January of 2025 I moved out to live with my aunt and uncle at 17, and at first everything was ok, hard but no different than my parents. But gradually things started to change. My uncle always commented on what I ate and when. If I wasn’t hungry so I skipped a meal, he would say that I was only ever eating what I enjoyed. That if it was (insert thing I enjoy) I would have seconds or thirds, and that I needed to be less picky. I love sweets, but I try not to eat too much. Admittedly I am not always great at it as self control has never been a strong suit but I have gotten much better. Living here there are things that were not considered desserts when I was with my parents, and if you eat them here you can’t have dessert. A list of things that are considered any dessert. Any kind of fruit, (except apples.) Smoothies. Juice Jam/jelly of any kind Honey. If you have any of these you can not have dessert, (cake or anything like that). The serving size is half of what it actually says. So if I am caught putting a tablespoon of jam on my sandwich they say “You know peanut butter is actually sweet enough without jam.”



	Some conversations about food I have had with my family, “Do you really want to eat that? Did you know that smoothies are actually sweeter than regular fruit? If you eat the fruit regularly it's actually better for you. I know your parents are overweight and haven't taught you good habits but I'm trying to help you but you only eat what you want when you want it. And if it's something you like you will eat more of it. You need to learn how to eat anything put in front of you. I can help you if you want me too. All you need to do is submit to me and the lord will work through you.” 

“If you eat that you will get diabetes, you could very easily get diabetes just because you only ever want sugar.”  
When I put BBQ sauce on my pulled pork sandwich, “You don’t actually need that. The pork has flavor, all you ever do is add condiments to your food. You don't even know what it actually tastes like.”

	On another note, both of my male cousins were at the time here, and had gotten back from working at a summer camp. They had said they would do the dishes since I had done them throughout the whole week along with all the other chores by myself. My uncle came in at 8pm, I was still working at some school and he asked who was going to do the dishes. I told him the boys said they were going to do it.   
“The boys? You expect them to do all the dishes? They have been working their ass off all week for the summer camp and are now working on (extracurricular) because they are the highest staff for it and incharge of it, I don’t mind doing the dishes since its apparently so hard for you too, but I don’t want the boys doing it.” I said that they had said they would, and he said “I don’t care what they said! You can do it or get the girls to do it but the boys don’t need to be doing it.” So I said that I would do it myself before I went to bed, and I set an alarm for 9pm. (bedtime is 10). So at 8:56pm he came in and snapped and said “Why are the god damn dishes not done?” I said I had an alarm set. I was still working at school and he walked over to me and my computer, put his hand on the back of my screen as if he was going to slam it closed and told me “Get up now and do the dishes.”

	My F cousins and I do the laundry, at the time we didn't have a schedule like now so we were all doing two to four loads twice a week. So sometimes it wasn't done until late. We would get yelled out, and then when we got into our camper, (where all five of us live) we hadn’t done the few dishes, which were almost all from his coffee in the morning, (he makes it with an airopress). And my aunt asked if any of us were going to do them, and he said “Oh don’t worry about it. Since they are so busy with school and we aren’t busy at all with work I just assume you or I will have to wash them tomorrow, and put the laundry away.” 

	My cousin once hadn’t decided if she was going to put her pants in the laundry or not yet because she'd only worn them twice. This went back and forth, he asked when she would decide, she said she had it on her schedule since she was busy with school at the moment. He asked why she couldn’t just decide then, when she said because she was busy at school he walked over, grabbed her pants, walked to the door, slammed it open and threw it onto the ground outside and said “Well they are dirty now, clean them. Don’t let your schedule rule you.” 

	I told my uncle I don’t think I can eat beef because everytime I eat it I get sick, feeling like I'm going to throw up and have bad diarrhea. He said that “Red meat feeds you for the spiritual battle, what do you think it means if you can’t eat it.” and ignore me when we have burgers, or any type of ground beef and just tell me to eat it.

	My aunt told me when I turned the AC on that “This isn’t your home, don’t turn it on without asking”.

	They have told me I am not an adult in their house because in their house I am still a child. Then turn and say “you are an adult now you need to be more responsible.” 

	My mental health has not been in a great place recently, to the point where I scratch myself, or dig my nails into my skin when I get upset or overwhelmed. My uncle would snap at me, and say that I looked depressed, and that I had no reason to be depressed. That I was opening the door to demonic spirits and that I needed to lift my life up to the Lord.

	He came into the room once and asked why the table wasn’t cleaned. I said that was my 15F cousin's things and she was cleaning and he snapped saying that she told him it was my job. And I had to go check. I asked which table, the dining table or the table in our room. He started yelling at me that it didn’t matter which table it was to just go deal with it. Later I asked him why, when I was calm and asked a question, did he go from 1-100, and he paused and said “It’s because you react better when I yell at you.” He told me that if I go into the world with “that attitude” that I would be “beaten and abused”. That I would fail and have to come back because they love me no matter what. 

	My aunt one day jokingly shook my head, both hands on the side of my head and shook me and I said “please don’t touch me.” She said that it was her house and she could do whatever she wanted. I said “I understand that but I am not your house. I am my own being, eighteen, and this is my body and I can ask you not to shake me.” She said in her house she can do whatever she wants.

	My cousin (15f) was talking to my uncle about limits, and how people have to push their limits to get better, and he said that people of our generation don’t know how to push their limits. That his father who was a photographer, following the president broke his leg, walked on it for three days before he passed out and dealt with it and that no one this day and age would do that. My cousin mentioned that last year at the (extracurricular) I broke my leg and no one knew. The medical at the event didn't notice and didn’t treat it properly, leaving me with only a walmart compression sleeve for a fibular spiral fracture all the way through. I walked on it. For a week. Before I went to the doctor. I didn’t drop out of the event, and I kept walking. My uncle said “yeah but she had crutches and pain meds. That doesn’t count.” (they took my crutches away not even 48 hours after I broke my leg.) Then he went on to talk about how his mother was you know what by a family member, as a teen and how she didn’t make a big deal of it and kept going…He said “obviously i dont want that to happen to you but your kind of people can’t push through like she did.”

	At an extracurricular event, an 80 + old man, 80+ grabbed a girl's hair and squeezed it. Twice. I told him that was not appropriate to do and not to touch our people as they are also minors and he said “I must have been born in the wrong generation because in my day and age it was ok to pull a girl's hair.” And I told my uncle how I almost said “Sir it's not that it was ok, it was that they were willing to put up with your bullshit and I am not.” And he said that would have been wrong because older men don't realize. It's not that bad to grab a girl's hair. And he just didn't know. Bullshit, I told him everyone knows you don’t touch someone without consent. And he defended the man. Not the girl.

	I went on a trip with my family, and we went on a hike for 7miles, up and down steep rocks. I hurt my ankle, twisted it multiple times. My uncle and aunt had been there and I made noises when I got hurt but they wanted to keep going so I sucked it up. The next day my leg was in a lot of pain so I was visibly limping trying not to cry. My uncle pulled me aside and said that “You need to stop being so dramatic. When you are offered to do things for others that you don't want to do you get miserable like this” And he did that over exaggeration parents do about being sad :( and slumped his shoulders. And said that “Whenever it's something you want to do it's all of a sudden ok and you don’t hurt anymore.” And then he said “And you are limping and I have to think you must be in either so much pain or you're over reacting. That's why no one knew your leg was broken last year because you over reacted.” (mind you my foot was twice the size, black, actual black and purple and yellow from my ankle down to my toes and up part of my calf.)

	My uncle acted like he was going to hit me. He found out I had told someone I didn’t want to stay with them all summer by myself since my cousins would be working at a summer camp. He found me that night and said “Did you tell (person) you didn’t want to stay with us? Don’t go spreading lies and deceit in my ministry, don't go turn people against me. Don't ruin this program for others and throw our name around, how do you think that makes us look? If you want to do that you can leave.”

	I went to another week long event, and admittedly i fucked up. I got thrown out for being “insabordinate” and went home early. My phone was confiscated and that made sense. But it was for the week…than a second week. And a third. And in the third week I could have my phone for an hour. But if I wanted to call my parents that cut into my hour. Then at four weeks I asked if I could have it back and they said no because I was always too secretive and sat in corners and excluded myself. (I am an introvert but my family doesn't believe in those things). Then after that it was because I didn't offer to help enough. Then it was because they didn't see a change in my heart. 71 days later I got my phone back and every time I had asked the reason changed.

	To this day they still ask what I am doing, I'm not allowed to sit alone with my devices, my computer always has to face a door so if someone walks in they can see what I’m doing. 



I feel like I'm going crazy, and I'm sure I missed some things. Please feel free to ask questions. I just need to know if I'm going crazy.

It sounds like they are discussing a contract but I don't want to be impolite and listen in. The people doing the selling (I don't know how else to call it since I don't know what they are talking about), are working pretty hard to convince the couple. It all looks very serious.

I've signed contracts for houses, and I've signed contracts for loans with my wife, and they are never done in coffee shops.

He was tall—so tall my five-foot-two frame barely reached his chest. He was dressed in a perfectly tailored, three-piece charcoal gray suit that spoke of quiet, astronomical expense. His dark brown hair was immaculately styled, and his features were sharp and severe. But it was his eyes that froze me in place—they were the color of glacial ice, and they were fixed, without a flicker of emotion, on me and the wreckage at my feet.

The temperature in the hallway plummeted.

His gaze swept over the dead keyboard, the coffee-flooded countertop, and finally landed on my face, which was surely a mask of pure terror.

""I-I'm so sorry!"" The words tumbled out in a mortified bow, nearly sending my glasses flying. ""I didn't mean to! The machine, it just—""

He finally spoke. His voice was a low, resonant baritone, as cold and unyielding as his stare. ""That is a Silent Swallow X1. Custom-built. One of a hundred in the world.""

*Silent what? A keyboard named after a bird?*

He glanced at a woman in a black suit who had appeared silently behind him. ""Linda. Calculate the damages. Notify HR.""

Linda, who I would later learn was the formidable Head of HR, was already tapping away on a tablet. ""Keyboard replacement, approximately twelve thousand dollars. Cleanup, estimated at five hundred. Potential data and productivity loss, incalculable,"" she recited, her voice as devoid of emotion as his. ""Miss Emily Chen, intern, ID number R734.""

She knew my name. I felt like a bug under a microscope.

Twelve… *thousand*… dollars? My brain short-circuited trying to do the math. They could sell me into servitude and it wouldn't cover the cost.

""I-I'll pay for it!"" My voice trembled, but I forced myself to stand straight. ""You can deduct it from my salary!""

The man—Alexander Blackwood, the CEO himself—seemed to assess me for a moment, his icy eyes scanning me from head to toe as if evaluating a damaged asset.

""Your entire intern salary, after taxes,"" Linda chimed in, swiping on her tablet, ""would cover the cost in approximately one hundred and twenty-seven years and four months.""

I was going to be sick.

Mr. Blackwood's gaze finally lifted from the coffee graveyard and settled on my face. ""Come with me,"" he commanded, turning back into his office.

Paralyzed, I stood there until Linda’s sharp voice prodded me from behind. ""Miss Chen. Mr. Blackwood is waiting.""

Swallowing hard and clutching my cursed thermos, I walked toward his office like a prisoner walking the green mile.",1,1762913939.0,TheCEOsWifeNovel,1,1.0,False
1ouszme,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ouszme,Coffee Subscription ended but still getting coffee.,"What the hell?! I paid for **THREE** Months of coffee and have gotten **FIVE.** 

The last three are all same! At first I thought my family got it for me but nobody buys same coffee thrice. 



Looks like they didn't sanitize their database 🫤. The 3 month option was removed soon after I bought the subscription. 
I have mailed them but no reply thus far.


PS: The coffee's not good as pourover but gives a nice chocolaty note when paired with milk. Doesn't stop me tho, making a v60 out of it and then grimacing is basically habit now.

PPS: Those little doodles are lethal; especially because those bags were free.

But I have seen a few different reviews noting there is a plastic taste that some users are tasting. I’m not sure if it’s due to the water line and the plastic tubing or what.

I’d be ready to buy this machine tomorrow but this type of feedback is worrisome for a few different reasons.

In my daily life I avoid anything plastic to avoid micro plastics. When it comes to this type of espresso machine I don’t think plastic can be avoided completely but if it’s leaching microplastics through its tubing it seems worrisome.  And obviously I want my coffee to taste amazing if I’m paying this much for a machine.

If you have this machine I would love your feedback. Thanks in advance!",0,1762913928.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I was pretty social. But in college actually post pandemic things fell apart. People acted different and my best friend seemed like a stranger. So I gave us space, we never talked again. I’m 25 now and one of my current close friends is someone I reconnected with in my early 20s. Thing is I haven’t spoken to her in almost half a year. Because she keeps doing things like group events she used to invite me to, but now doesn’t. My high school friends i would continue to text but realized they were leaving me on read. That’s fine, but no like formal communication. A lot of them I still have on socials. Some full on removed me from their socials.


It hurts a lot because people tell me it’ll happen. It hasn’t. I didn’t go away for college, made like no friends. I don’t have roommates or date or have much of a social life. I just feel really directionless. Like I have so much love to give 😓. Other times I think well everyone has their group. I used bumble bff but it’s like everyone there either talks a little or they have friends/ just want to have social media followers. I constantly think about reaching out to people I used to know in school. I actually did! But they just message a bit and then fade away. 


It sucks to admit this but I am on the dating apps and guys will ask how was ur weekend and I’m like… did nothing. I do a lot alone don’t get me wrong but it’s things such as movies, coffee shops, shopping. I sometimes just want a girls night  ",27,1762913909.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,7,1.0,False
