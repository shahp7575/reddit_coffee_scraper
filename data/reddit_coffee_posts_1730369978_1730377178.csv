1ggd0su,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1ggd0su/nandu_urf_chugalkhor_mehra/,Nandu urf chugalkhor Mehra ,"What a clever man. He knew that bigg Boss aired all his backbitching about Vivian so why not play reverse psychology with audience.

He very well knew if he accepts that he is jealous of Vivian because of his succes, shows , looks then audience will be like omg KV you are better looking than him

KV you are the best , KV you won KKK

KV is such a manipulator who always talks audience is watching , your family is watching but he never talks about if his family is watching or not. His daddy/ papa jokes aren't savage. 

He questions viv for hanging out with Avinash that why is he with them...Avinash is 28 years old. Viv is 36 yrs so he is only 8 years older than him. In workplace , it's common to have friends of different age group. I have a best friend who is 10 years older than me at my workplace. 

Maturity doesn't come from age and KV is example of it. Mr. Age card doesn't mind making romantic angle with chum who is 8 years younger than him. Chum looks like his assistant. She has no opinion of her own but Mr. KV is selectively blind as he calls Avinash and Viv as assistant of each other.

Viv and Avi had their own set of disagreements in initial weeks but they didn't went personal with each other. Even in food train task , it was Avinash who gave food to Vivian to save him from nominations, which was denied by his muh boli sister Shrutika.

After first fight of KV and Avinash, Viv made KV privately understand that keechad mein haath mat haath daalo, it was a good advise by friend.

Avi started to have soft corner for viv after his fake eviction, when everyone was against him , it was viv who made him understand where he went wrong and he shouldn't have crossed certain lines..he even asked him to not go personal..
Viv was the first one to ask chum if she felt safe or not.

During wkw, Mr. Nandu asked passive aggressively Vivian yes/no question, the body language and tone of kV wasn't of a friend. If kV really considered viv as a friend, he would have discussed with viv before wkw but Mr. Nandu took it as an opportunity to put down viv because answer was never in yes/no, the whole situation was in grey area.

Viv and Avi have different perspective regarding game and I have seen in livefeed where viv always told avi that don't cross the line and he won't correct his pov because everyone is an individual here.
Avinash who made eisha and Alice cry in torture task, he was easily ready to give coffee to vivian. Avinash might be a nuisance to each otf the housemates but he is damn nice to vivian so why should vivian fight with him when kV group didn't take a second to go against him. Avinash was the only one who defended vivian in leadership topic during wkw and viv never had any expectations from Avinash so definitely viv will be more inclined towards him.

Mr..Nandu conveniently calls viv as his friend during bharta topic and he even lied that I didn't eat, the matter was stretched because of kV lying.. kv calls viv junior artist but suddenly viv is more successful than KV.

Mr. Nandu says no one will beat each other and stops everyone from stopping the fights but he conveniently didn't go to jail because he might get physical with Avinash. He is doubtful to his patience level but others are mindful. Rajat was manhandling Avinash but Mr. Nandu was like don't stop it. Cowardice behaviour because KV's intention was to get Rajat or Avinash out of the house.

KV was ready to give basic ration to everyone but he and his group bullied chahat for making food. KV was so insensitive during CA of chahat, he was like go and say to him main bhi tere se pyaar karti hu. He doesn't have any soft spot for chahat, he just egged on chahat as an opportunity to against Avinash because on wkw , Mr. KV didn't even raise his hand when Salman asked if avinash was wrong. It was bagga who supported chahat in CA matter really otherwise nandu is just an opportunist who sets fake narratives against everyone. 

Also KV knows very well how people are perceived outside like how he knew chahat must be getting sympathy. He has mastered in bigg Boss course so he already knew that shilpa's betrayal in raja task will get him sympathy that's why he is so good friend to Shilpa as he burned the bridges with vivian. He will be nice to Shilpa so that Audience says kv is so nice that he didn't get upset with Shilpa , he is so good friend. Whatever I dislike Mr. Nandu urf victim and fake narrative setter.

I had a root canal done months ago and from time to time it’ll throb within the “tooth” as though sensitive but it shouldn’t have any feeling whatsoever right? What could this mean? It kinda feels like it’s being tugged on when I make a suction feeling in my mouth (not sure how else to explain it)

2. I’ve had my gums checked and brought up the smell concern and the oral hygienist didn’t bring up any concerns/red flags but when I floss my teeth especially more toward the back on each side regardless of just brushing or flossing the floss smells terrible like sewage.

3. In this photo, does this look like a cavity? As you can see there’s a filling from last year there.

I vape (in the process of quitting), drink very occasionally, and I drink probably 3 sugar free redbull and 2 coffees a week if that matters. Oh and I grind my teeth in my sleep. 

I have had a lot of fillings done, I tend to get cavities easily something regarding my enamel. ",1,1730376731.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1ggcyle,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggcyle,Millie's Cookies - MCIA Terminal 1 Departure Area,"My family was mentioning to me this cookie stall na nasa Mactan Airport Terminal 1, so I went for it para naay pasalubong sa ilaha pag-abot nako sa akong hometown sa Davao during the long weekend.

There I knew the stall was Millie's Cookies, but never thought this was a UK brand. According to their website, Millie's Cookies is ""a chain of retail bakeries based in the United Kingdom, specializing in cookies, muffins, hot drinks and gifts."" Naintriga jud ko so nipalit ko. 

I bought a Treat Box worth 310 pesos composed of 6 regular sizes cookies. Each cookie is individually priced at 55 to 65 pesos for regular size and 120-135 pesos for the large size. I went for all flavors: plain, smores, red velvet, choco chip, double choco, and matcha. Of course kay di na gyud malikayan ang gutom, nipalit na lang pod ko isa ka large matcha cookie. 

When I ate the cookie, it was the chewiest, crumbliest, most flavorful matcha cookie I ever ate. Lami ang pagka matcha flavor niya and dili kaayo tam-is. Solid 10/10 for me.

I shared the box with my family in Davao and they really loved it! 

Haven't tried the coffee but hope I can try them once I have another flight sa MCIA soon.

Sayang naa ra ni sa Airport as far as I know. Hope they branch out within Cebu soon.

Are you curious about coding and getting a career in software development?  
Ever thought about creating a website, app, hardware, video game or whatever else?

I'm a [software engineer with 7 years of experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-graziani-10ba5a140/), just moved back to Fuerteventura from London with my wife and daughter.

I'm planning to volunteer 1 hour weekly to mentor people in their coding journey.  
Ideally, this would be in real life, in the North part of the island e.g. a coffee shop, restaurants.  
I asked for library space but got lost in the local admin weeds...

I don't have problems speaking English, Spanish or Italian.  
You are not expected to have any prior experience in coding.  
Some knowledge of English might be useful but not necessary

There is a strong emphasis worldwide on supporting women's presence in STEM.   
Only 1/4 of the STEM workforce is women, and employers are actively trying to fill this gap.  
Also, my wife and sister might be joining this group.  
  
There is also plenty of support in this industry for every minority.  
Please, do not feel held back by your gender, sexual preference, disability, religion and/or country of origin.  
Everybody is welcome!

There is plenty of material online, e.g. CodeAcademy, FreeCodeCamp, [Code.org](http://Code.org)   
You will decide your way, I will be there to provide an expert opinion and unblock you in case you need that help.

I'm doing this for free for several reasons - there will be no hidden charges eventually!

Lmk!

I was naturally really nervous and so a little awkward, the conversation didn’t flow totally naturally but I’m willing to accept that as a part of having never met him before.

We had coffee, then went and got sushi, and then we went back to his place and had some wine. We didn’t talk much or have a super long conversation because I’m so awkward and didn’t know what to say, but we started cuddling and even kissing. He wanted to be little spoon the whole time and I was a bit like uh ohh cause usually I prefer to be the submissive one, but I didn’t mind it actually and we did take turns every so often. 

This is where I fear something is up. He is SO attractive and sweet and his kisses would be heartbreaking for anyone… except me, it seems, because the whole time I struggled to feel anything passionate or happy. I just felt like I was kissing flesh. I am attracted to him 100%, but maybe it’s my anxiety that’s blocking me from these feelings?? 

I feel like a broken robot lol. I thought I was ready to start exploring physical and emotional relationships after a longgg period of struggling with my mental health but maybe I’m mistaken? 

I just wanna feel these incredible feelings that everyone describes and make him happy but I can’t and it’s so frustrating. Granted, it IS the first time.

I saw  one of the regulars and decided to ask him if his schedule had been messed up as well? 

*I have never spoken with this guy I just see him everyday but I did think I knew him from HS* 

He mentioned that yes it had affected him and how he was only getting an hour in. I then asked him which of the twins he was (High school) and he said neither that he was the older brother. Now the entire time the man was sweating buckets and not because of his workout and we made some small talk on what we did for a living but even this was really awkward and painful. When I told him what I did he got very weird almost intimidated (I get this often in my line of work) he told me what he did he again retracted into himself and got embarrassed and said he worked blue collar - I replied that’s a good job and Blue Collar is sexy (I honestly love a blue collar man) 

Since then we say hello at the gym and spoke last week where he asked if I wanted to go for coffee. 

I’ll admit I probably should have said no but I didn’t want to embarrass him in the middle of the gym by rejecting him in front of everyone and I said sure - he then fumbled and mumbled something and we awkwardly stood there for what seemed forever and I handed him my phone where he then messed up putting his contact info into my phone (he texted himself his own number) 


I texted him back and really didn’t chat much - I had a busy day and he asked how my day went and I was conversational but his painful shyness was even coming through the messages. He then waited a full 24hours to respond to me (granted he owes me nothing) but it didn’t show me initiative or interest on his part. 

I figured that after I gave him my number his shyness and awkwardness would go away. 

I ended up ignoring his 10th msg asking me how my day is going … again … but now I feel bad. I’ll for sure say hello at the gym but do I tell him the truth and tell him it’s because he’s awkward and painfully shy? I feel like he needs help to get over that but how can he get help if he doesn’t know. 

I feel honesty is always best when it comes from a place of wanting to better someone else but then again is that even my place? Why waste my time? 

The poor guy is just really shy and awkward and in my line of work I can’t really be with someone like that 

Any advice would be helpful

Casual, simple, understated. He grinned—she was clearly someone who appreciated subtlety, and he had just the thing to impress her.

He sauntered over, brushing imaginary dust off his calfskin Rick Owens Creatch cargo pants. “Hey,” he said, “those boots are… cute. River Island, right?” She blinked up at him, a little thrown off, but nodded. “Yeah, just something casual.”

He smiled. “Oh, totally. I get it. I, uh, personally am more of a Rick Owens guy.” Her polite smile stayed in place, but she raised an eyebrow. “This bomber? FW15 ‘Sphinx’—full cowhide, hand-stitched by Rick’s Paris team. The textural difference alone is, like, insane.”

She opened her mouth, maybe to introduce herself, but he steamrolled on. “And these pants? They’re from the SS18 ‘Dirt’ collection. Really iconic stuff. Rick’s work that season was like, a primal, raw reinterpretation of minimalism. Honestly, revolutionary.”

“Uh, cool,” she mumbled, looking over his shoulder like she might need an escape route. “So, I was actually just about to—”

“And these boots,” he interrupted, shifting to show off his Beatle boots from the FW14 ‘Moody’ line, “are an absolute grail. Finding them in a size 42 was almost impossible. It’s, like, true archival stuff, you know? Real fans would get it.”

Her eyes glazed over as he kept talking, transitioning into the stitching on his leather jacket (“double-stitched, French seams”) and the layered tank top from the SS16 ‘Cyclops’ collection. Every time she tried to add something, even just a nod, he cut her off with more details about Rick Owens’ philosophy and how each piece he wore tied back to Rick’s complex vision.

Finally, she snapped. “I… have no idea what you’re talking about! I don’t know who Rick Owen is—”

“Owens, actually,” he corrected, wagging a finger. “Rick Owens. Just… iconic, you know?”

She took a deep breath, her patience unraveling. “I don’t care if you’re wearing Rick and Morty! I just wanted a coffee!” Her voice rose, eyes wild, and, suddenly, she screamed—an actual, full-on scream—then spun around, bolting out the door.

For the past 10 years I've had them under control really good. May of this year I started have them big time all day everyday. I've tried changing my diet and have lost 35 lbs. Cut out caffeine. Tried magnesium and L theanine. Got on buspar. Nothing really helped. I was Vitamin D deficient and have got that up to normal levels. With the diet change (keto) I no longer take high blood pressure pills. But the anxiety and panic was still there. 

Ready to try anything. I contacted a IV infusion place to maybe get some Vitamins but the lady I talked to recommended IV Glutathione. It was only 80 dollars and am willing to try anything. Monday I done the infusion it took like 15 mins. Since then I have felt like 80% better. Brain fog has been the biggest thing it helped but my anxiety and panic has been reduced A LOT. Don't think it is a placebo effect. Yesterday and today I have had a cup of coffee and nothing bad from that as before it would send me straight into panic mode. I've been having to take hydroxyzine during the day and since the infusion I haven't had to take anything.

1ggcpxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1ggcpxc/house_manager/,House manager 🙄,"There is an on going and apparently endless fight in my house around chores.

My husband will not lift a finger to do a chore unless directed or absolutely necessary. 

Like he makes himself and our daughter breakfast in the morning after I go to work but he doesn't clean up when he's done. He leaves the frying pan on the stove, doesn't wipe down the highchair or table or clear their dishes. 

This morning we had the same fight all over again.

His father was supposed to be coming to pick him and baby up to go the city for his drs appointment, and he was annoyed the house wasn't ""presentable"" for when he gets here.

So after sleeping for almost 40 minutes longer than he said he was going to, he finally gets up and starts drinking his coffee and then immediately starts making comments about picking the place up before anyone gets here.

He kept saying ""what can *we* do to make it look more presentable?"" 

I said we could pick up the livingroom and fix the cushions and it makes a world of difference. 

He agreed and then wandered off to get ready. 

So *we* turned into *me* immediately. I'm wandering around collecting laundry and fixing the couch while he hangs out in the bathroom. 

He finally comes out and continues to point out messy things and complain about it not being done already because I ""had all day"" to take care of it and I ""knew people were coming for at least a week"".

I try to say that I can't and don't want to do everything my self and he jumps in with ""then don't! Delegate the tasks you don't want to do!"" And goes on to explain how he ""runs this household"" and the house is entirely my domain and my responsibility and how I'm the ""house manager"" so it's MY JOB to direct and delegate and tell him what chores to do. To ""enforce"" the chore chart on the wall because he's certainly not going to look at it himself.

It doesn't make a difference how many times I tell him that I do NOT want to do it that way and that he should he able to do the exact thing he constantly expects me to do and just look around, identify what needs doing and take care of it. 

Nope. Not interested. He says he ""cleans all day"" at work and he's not doing damn thing at home unless he's asked. 

I started bitching that I don't want to have to nag him, literally daily to do what's on the chart and he basically rolled his eyes and said he didn't care if I didn't want to or didn't like it, I'm the ""house manager"" and it's my job and I have to do it because it's my job to teach our daughter these skills too. 

And then he tried to say that from 530pm to 10pm the house is mine and that's when I should be doing everything. Never fucking mind that during that time I already clean the fucking kitchen, cook supper, feed the baby, get her ready and do the entire bedtime routine DAILY. No, apparently that all takes ""25 minutes at most"" and I should have toooonnsss of time to do fucking chores.

At NO point did I agree to be a fucking manager. At no point did I agree to mother his ass into doing freaking chores. 

When our daughters big enough to help, sure, I'll be giving her chores to do and making sure she gets them done but that's not the same freaking thing and directing a grown ass man to do basic adulting.

I managed to get a really good cup at first brew with following parameters: Comandante 23 click grind, t93 - 14/200 - 3 pours, 50 cl bloom at 40 seconds, and 2 more pours at 40 and 1:15 - with Hario V60.

And then, even though I do the same recipe I get really shitty cups now. And it's ben only 2-3 days since I opened the pack :)

Anyone has experience with this coffee? And recommendations on my recipe is much appreciated!

1ggcnh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggcnh8/the_girl_in_402_part_1/,The Girl in 402 [Part 1],"I knew one day I would have to tell this story. It took me a year to finally sit down and do it. I’ve been told that doing this could help me move on, but that’s not what this is for. I don’t expect to move on. The girl in 402 will always be with me. I’m telling this story, simply, because I have to.

 

I lived there for two years. It was a tiny little unit, tucked away on the very right of the fourth floor. Bachelor is almost generous. It was the kind of dingy place that never looks bright no matter how many lights you have on, but I liked it. I’m good with a small space, I enjoy not having that much to take care of. I could do without the bug problems, the leaks, the electrical problems, and the rotten smells that just sort of happen, but it is what it is.

 

There was a level of comfort, as well, to living on the fourth floor. Nobody robs a random fourth floor apartment unit. Nobody can peek into your window. It’s unlikely to get shot at… Yeah, I lived in one of those kinds of cities. You didn’t walk around at night if you could help it. You just didn’t.

 

I got accustomed to noise there. The cars, the sirens, the dogs barking, the shouting, the occasional echoing pop of a gunshot. It all becomes a whirling auditory soup. I learned to tune it out fairly quickly. In fact, I learned to tune out a lot of things.

 

I was in one of those periods of life that I think some people call “the grind” but really it’s more like being beaten into submission. Working to live, living to work – not living at all, just continuing to exist. All of this to say, I wasn’t very perceptive or sociable at this time. I was sleepwalking and daydreaming through life.

 

I’d say I could do my routine blindfolded except for the fact that I would stub my toe in the same spot on the coffee table 4 times a week at least. Funny how that works. I guess that was part of the routine too. But that’s what I mean about not being perceptive. The building could’ve caught fire and most days I probably wouldn’t have noticed until I actually went up in flames. I didn’t retain any faces I saw or names I heard. It was all just a blur, each day blending into the next. Until one night.

 

I got home from work like usual in the evening as the sun began to descend past the buildings. I couldn’t afford a car, but thankfully my work was close enough to walk to. The days were getting shorter now so my walks home became more brisk.

 

The apartment still smelled of dust and paint as they had finally sent someone to replace a moldy bit of wall the day before. I could still feel the sensation of dust collecting on my tongue when I opened my mouth and it getting sucked into my nose with every inhale. The smell of paint was strong, but infinitely better than some of the other smells.

 

I opened the window to attempt to ventilate the place, I emptied the bucket of rust coloured water collecting in the bathroom (they couldn’t be bothered to fix that as well), and I collapsed onto my bed. This was my ritual. After every work day, I would always take 10-15 minutes to just spread out on my bed like a cat and decompress from everything. But tonight, after about two minutes, I heard a noise.

 

This noise stood out from all the outdoor soup because it sounded a lot closer, and it sounded like a voice. A soft, feminine voice; making some kind of subtle moan or whimper. I froze in place. It startled me. It sounded SO close. Like it might be in the room. I didn’t move a muscle; I didn’t want to make a noise. I wanted to hear it again so I could tell where it was coming from. For a second I thought it might be coming from under my bed.

 

After a few seconds, the sound repeated. A faint, girly whimper. A bit louder than the last one. This time I could tell where it was coming from. It was behind me. Specifically, the other side of the wall behind my bed. That gave me some relief. It was my neighbor.

 

But then I was confused. I didn’t remember EVER hearing my neighbor making noise before. If I could suddenly hear a noise that soft, that mild, why couldn’t I hear anything before? Did I even have a neighbor before? Is this person new? I felt a rush of shame at just how detached I had become.

 

I reached back into my mind to try and recall any memories I had about my neighbor. I couldn’t find a single one. I remembered some people being on my floor, but I couldn’t remember ever seeing anyone enter or exit the door next to mine. I did, however, recall seeing people yesterday morning trying to move a couch up the stairs in the lobby. It was a fairly regular occurrence to see things like this. People rotated in and out of this place all the time. I suppose nobody else really wanted to stick around that long, and I can see why. But I guess that answers it. As peculiar as it is, I didn’t have a neighbor before - for two years - and now I do. And now they’re… whimpering? Why are they whimpering?

 

Slowly these sporadic whimpers become more defined sobs. A woman was crying. I didn’t know what to do. I just decided to be as quiet as possible and put on some headphones to let them have their privacy and spare myself from feeling any more awkward. It felt wrong to hear this, and I immediately felt bad for this person. I made sure to play some extra loud music.

 

About an hour later, I removed my headphones and the noises had stopped in the interim. I very briefly debated going over and telling them about how thin the walls apparently are, but I made the much easier decision to wait. Wait until they do something loud and not so private so I can use that as the excuse. Like the TV or something. I was weighing my options. But I couldn’t talk to them about THIS. I couldn’t say “Hey you were crying real loud over there.”

 

The rest of the night was quiet but I didn’t have the best sleep. This disturbance in the routine, and the thought of having to face this person at some point was giving me some anxiety. By the morning, however, the alarm kicked me back into the routine. I heard no noises from the neighbor, so life resumed.

 

I got back home from work that night, much later than usual because someone decided to no-show at work. Walking home in the dark made me paranoid and I hated days when this happened. When I got inside I was relieved, and the dust and paint were not nearly as oppressive to the senses this time. I did the window, the water bucket, and then collapsed on the bed like clockwork. What happened yesterday was still on my mind, so I made sure to be extra quiet when laying down. After a few seconds of silence, I was ready to try and remove the whole ordeal from my brain. Then I heard the voice.

 

I couldn’t make out the first word I heard from the other side of the wall, but I listened for the rest.

 

“It was a poetry book.” I heard in a muffled but distinctly feminine voice. Quieter than yesterday, I thought. She must be further away from the wall.

 

“I can’t remember exactly.”

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere.”

 

“Maybe that’s why we see them most at night.”

 

“I mixed up our glasses.”

 

There was a moderate gap of a few seconds between everything she said. Clearly, I was only hearing half of a conversation. Phone conversation most likely, or else the other person is just insanely quiet.

 

It was difficult to gauge her tone from how muffled the voice was, but there was a kind of melancholy in it. I wondered what was going on, and I kind of laughed at how random the phrases were. I thought about listening further but I stopped myself. It wasn’t my business. It’s not for me to hear. I once again thought about going over and letting her know about the noise, but it didn’t feel like a good time. I put on my headphones once again to try and enjoy the minimal amount of respite I had left in the day, and that was the end of it for that night.

 

The third night I got home on time. I was a bit surprised not to hear anything from her at first. I guessed that maybe she went to bed early or went out for the night. It was Friday after all, usually people do things on Friday nights. I still made sure to be quiet when near her wall just in case she was sleeping. I made a mental note to look up how much soundproofing panels cost. I probably should have thought of that earlier.

 

I got up from my 15 minute “work sucks” bed sprawling and headed over to my computer to do that important research, but – as I often did – I forgot my coffee table exists and I stubbed my toe. The heavy table shifted inches across the wooden floor and pain shot through me like a shockwave. I don’t remember which expletive left my mouth involuntarily that time, but it was definitely one of them. I was so annoyed. Every damn time. I could just move the table, why don’t I ever just move the fucking table?

 

“Are you okay?” My heart leapt in my chest. I physically jumped back on one leg. I thought she wasn’t home, and I forgot how close she could sound. It scared the shit out of me. She also spoke quite loudly, she probably assumed it would be harder to hear through the wall than it was.

 

“Oh. Yeah. I’m good. Sorry. I just stubbed my toe.” I responded back in a shaky voice.

 

 “Shit. That sucks.” I could hear a chuckle in her voice, she was clearly amused. Her volume decreased to match mine.

 

I laughed in return, “It happens ALL the time… So sorry to disturb you.”

 

“No no it’s fine, I’m just reading… You sure you’re good? That sounded violent.” She responded, sounding half-concerned and half-joking.

 

“Yeah, no, I’m alright. It sounded worse than it was. It’s a heavy table and… the walls here-“ I began to explain before she cut me off.

 

“They’re REALLY thin, huh?” She finished my thought and then continued, “I can hear you so well, that’s insane. I’m surprised I didn’t hear you before now.”

 

“Yeah I guess I’m quiet... And, well, I’m at work most of the day and get home late. So.” I didn’t like how awkward I sounded. I think I forgot how to have normal conversations.

 

“Has it been noisy for you? I’m sorry if it was, I didn’t know. I just moved in.” She sounded very kind, and friendly. I was taken aback by it a little bit.

 

“Oh, don’t be sorry and… Nothing much. I think I probably heard you talking on the phone a bit the other night. I didn’t listen in or anything, I put on my headphones.” I explained. I hoped she believed me about the headphones. It was the truth but, it’s hard to trust that sort of thing. I didn’t mention the crying, I didn’t want her to feel awkward or anything.

 

“Oh. Sorry about that...” She said. I detected a hint of confusion in her voice but I ignored it.

 

“It’s okay. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I just didn’t know when it would be a good time and... It’s new to me too. I didn’t have a neighbor before, I don’t think.” As I spoke, I found it harder to rationalize why I hadn’t told her before now… I really should have.

 

“Really? How long have you been here?” She asked.

 

“Two years.”

 

“No one lived here before me for two years? Are you sure?” She was very perplexed.

 

“Well… Honestly, no, I’m not sure. I just never heard anyone before, and I never saw anyone before.” I probably sounded like a total recluse, but I was more interested in why she was so confused.

 

“Oh. That’s strange… I’m pretty sure there were people living here right before me, at least that’s what the guy said.” Her tone had shifted, and what she said sent a bit of a shiver down my spine. It didn’t make any sense. How could I not hear them, not once, when I can practically hear this woman breathing?

 

After a brief silence, she spoke again and returned to a more casual tone “Well… Maybe they weren’t around much. Maybe it was a second home or something. Anyways, sorry again about the noise. I’ll get some soundproofing stuff for my end right away.” I admired her positivity, and I didn’t feel any judgment from her for how strange I probably came across. It was really nice. And she had a point about it being a second home. That could be the case. I don’t know why they would have a second home in this shitty building but… What else could the explanation be?

 

“I’m Jane by the way. Nice to kind-of meet you.” She added in a chipper manner. While it was refreshing to have such a pleasant interaction, a small part of me worried about her. She was so carefree and optimistic – almost naïve. She must be new to the city. I wondered how long it would take before this place whittled away at her trust in humanity. The trust that she seemed to give to me so freely. The thought of her spirits being slowly crushed like mine made me sad.

 

“I’m Leigh. Nice to meet you too.” A small impulse told me not to give my name, but I decided to reciprocate her trust. “And yeah, I’ll soundproof my end too.”

 

“Have a good rest of your night. And be careful.” She said. I found that slightly ominous but then I remembered the toe thing.

 

“I will.” I chuckled. “Enjoy your book.”

 

That was my first conversation with the girl in 402. Over that weekend, we spent a lot of time getting acclimated to each others’ presence as we each waited to get our soundproofing. I expected it to be a lot more awkward than it was. I attribute all of that to her. She had a way of making everything seem fine, and almost playful. She would knock on the wall two times and say things like “about to vacuum, sorry” And “my bad” when she would make noise. I would follow her lead and do the same two knocks. It was kind of nice.

 

Out of the blue on Sunday, she knocked twice and said “You know… it’s weird. I don’t hear my neighbors on the other side at all. Only you.” We pondered over that a bit. She didn’t seem to sweat it much, but it WAS odd that it was only on one side. These odd things were beginning to stack up. Why just this wall? Why only now? I began to wonder if more odd things have been happening all along and I’m only starting to notice them now.

 

Monday night I got home to find my package had arrived. The soundproofing was here. It was a little bittersweet seeing it on my doorstep. I knocked twice and told her I got it. She confirmed that she got her’s too. She actually went out and physically bought it. I guess that speaks to the kind of people we are.

 

We both said we’d put it up right away. Both of us not wanting to continue to inconvenience each other any longer… But then that didn’t end up happening. Instead we just kept talking. I didn’t mean to, and I don’t think she did either, but we just kept finding more to say. The friendly small talk about the building and whatnot gave way to more meaningful conversation. We talked about how we got to where we were. We talked about where we wanted to go from here. I wound up sitting on the floor with my back to her wall and I could her hear words right behind my head as if we were back-to-back. Luckily the paint on that bit of wall was dry by now.

 

To her, this place was a fresh start. She didn’t go into detail, and I didn’t want to pry, but it was clear that this was some kind of escape from something. Maybe that’s why she was so upbeat, because she was able to escape a bad situation. Or maybe, she was just always this upbeat.

 

She told me that she was going to enroll in the college here, and that she was going to start an online shop, and work as a waitress on the side. Eventually she wanted to open a restaurant. She even told me where, and what the name and theme would be. She told me all these plans, all these wonderful things she wanted to do, all laid out step by step. I don’t know what was preventing her from doing them before, but it made me smile hearing how excited she was about them. Something about the conviction in her voice made me truly believe she could do it all.

 

Then she asked me about my plans. I froze up a bit. I didn’t have plans. I wish I did, I was envious of people who did, but I could never seem to figure it out. At some point I think I shut that part of me off entirely.

 

“This was as far as I got” is what I told her. We sat in silence for a bit after that.

 

“There’s still time.” she said softly, breaking the silence. I could feel in her voice a new level of comfort and safety. All guards were down on both sides. She knew what I needed to hear, and I knew somehow that those words meant more coming from her than they would anyone else. We simply got each other. In that moment, there was no wall.

 

Eventually we said goodnight, and agreed to put the panels up tomorrow. Those soft, comforting words rattled around in my brain all night long. They never really left.

 

I woke up early the next day, and I began putting them up before work. It was a bit sad at first, but it’s not like she was gone or anything. She was still right next door. We could just be friends normally now. I went to work excited about the idea.

 

On my way home, I decided that I would properly introduce myself face to face. Just to say hi. I felt confident enough in doing so by this point of knowing her. I got up to the door of 402, and after a brief hesitation, I did the two knocks.

 

About two minutes passed and there was no answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was disappointed but not dejected. She must not be around. I’ll try again tomorrow, I thought.

 

When I got inside, I was immediately struck by how much quieter it was. All that constant city noise was getting absorbed by the panels. I didn’t even think about that. I wasn’t used to this kind of quiet. Now every small sound was large. I felt vulnerable. Like all the noise was a big comfy blanket I could hide under and now I’m exposed like a nerve. It would take some getting used to.

 

An hour passed in this utter dreary silence. I tried to brave it without distraction to try and acclimate as quickly as possible, but it was just too freaky, so I had to put on some music.

 

Not five seconds into the song, I heard “No way!” coming from the wall. It was her.

 

“Jane? You can still hear me??” I almost shouted in disbelief.

 

“Did you put your things up?” She responded; her voice was exactly as clear as before.

 

“Yeah! Did you?”

 

“I covered the whole wall!” She shouted.

 

“What the hell?” I was feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, it was nice to talk to her again. On the other hand… What the hell?

 

We were both utterly stumped by this. Neither of us could come up with an explanation or a solution. She offered to try and ask the super to come do something. I told her she could TRY.

 

Eventually we settled back down and accepted the situation.

 

“Well… Shit, I guess you’re here to stay.” She said.

 

“I guess I am.” I couldn’t tell if she was happy about this or annoyed. I couldn’t quite tell if I was either.

 

“Alright… I hope you like ABBA then.”

 

I hated ABBA. This was a nightmare.

 

We resumed our routine from the days before. It remained mildly inconvenient, while also being oddly comforting. That night we talked more, sat in the same spots on the floor as the night before. I don’t know why we chose to sit on the floor when both of our beds were right there, but it felt right. The discoloration of the new patch of paint on the wall marked the talking spot perfectly, and it felt a bit nostalgic. It’s not often you sit on the floor as an adult.

 

With all the excess noise being drowned out, it felt like she was even closer. I could literally hear her breathing. We talked a little bit about our upbringings, and we aren’t terribly different. Her dad sucked, my dad died. We all got fucked up somehow. The good news is, she informed me that I don’t snore loudly at night which is a huge relief.

 

I laid up in bed, after she had said goodnight. I still hadn’t acclimated to the silence, and now I had to bear it if I wanted to sleep. It wasn’t working. I was just awake with my thoughts, which is a place I usually hate being, but not so much tonight.

 

I thought about Jane, and I thought about the weirdness of this situation. As odd as it all was, it was at least interesting. By far the most interesting thing to happen to me since I moved here. I began having those middle of the night urges to google the principles of sound waves and how they travel. Or how often apartments are vacant for long periods of time. But I resisted, determined that if I laid here unmoving in the dark long enough, sleep would happen.

 

Briefly piercing the silence, I heard a mattress creak a few times and blankets shift. It sounded like she rolled over. Then back to nothing.

 

I checked the clock. 2 am. Maybe sleep was hopeless. I stared into the dark of my apartment so long I started seeing abstract shapes and folds fade in and out of the shadows and the walls seemed to wobble, as they are want to do. I was so tired.

 

I began to fade but then another mattress creak brought me back to lucidity. This one was different. It was a deeper creak, and singular, like one fluid motion. She sat up.

 

Without question, that was the sound... But that was the only sound. No creaks, no fidgeting, no swiping sounds of blankets moving while she slowly awoke. It was strange and abrupt. It could be that she had a nightmare, but there was no heavy breathing or gasping or any of that.

 

I waited to hear another sound, but it didn’t come. A half hour passed. I didn’t hear her get out of bed, I didn’t hear her lay back down. Was she just… sitting? My mind began to paint of picture of a woman sitting still in bed in the pitch black darkness and it unnerved me.

 

Maybe she did lay back down, just slowly and softly enough that I didn’t hear it, I thought. Maybe she had her book or something - she said she was reading the other day. Maybe she never sat up at all, and I mistook that sound for something else.

 

I didn’t hear anything else that night, and about an hour later I managed to get some sleep.

 

I wondered if I could bring this up to her. Would it be weird? Eventually I decided against it. I don’t want her thinking about me listening to her sleep. The situation is already a bit uncomfortable as it is when it comes to privacy. Plus, it was probably nothing.

 

The next night I got home and double knocked on the wall. She double knocked back. This was our new normal.

 

“Hey, never date a tennis player. You know why?” She said.

 

“Why’s that?” I responded through my grin as I dealt with the water bucket once again.

 

“Love means nothing to them.” She made sure to sound extra dramatic.

 

“That’s – wow. That’s tremendous.” I responded, bemused.

 

“I’m gonna hit you with one of those every day, I decided.” She said emphatically.

 

“Oh god.” I pretended to sound annoyed.

 

“That’s right. This is why I don’t have a boyfriend. They all run away. But you can’t run away.”

 

“I can move away.”

 

“No you can’t, you’re broke as shit just like me. If you could have, you would have by now.” She had a point.

 

“So deal with it. Here: what do you call a beehive with no exit?” She continued.

 

“No. No more. This is harassment. I weep for your future husband... When you bring a man over, I’m going to shout at him to run as fast as he can. I will just scream bloody murder until he leaves.”

 

“Un-BEE-LEAVE-able.”

 

“God damn it. I like that one.” I replied, I couldn’t lie.

 

“Also I’m never bringing a man over here, are you kidding? You hear enough as it is.” Again, she had a point.

 

We went about our business, and later that night we talked a bit more. These floor chats before bed we’d started having had become a highlight of my day and I began looking forward to them while I was at work.

 

A part of my brain was trying to recontextualize this into a romantic thing, but it really wasn’t that, and I didn’t want it to be. At least not right now. It was just… nice. It was nice having someone to talk to, who was easy to talk to, who made me laugh, and who I felt comfortable with. It was nice to feel genuinely connected to somebody after feeling disconnected for so long. It was nice to have a friend.

 

“Can I ask you something?” I inquired.

 

“Yeah.” She answered without hesitation.

 

“Why did you trust me, so early on?” I had this question for a while but I felt comfortable enough now to ask.

 

Jane paused for a moment before responding, “What makes you think I trusted you?”

 

I was a bit taken aback by her question. “Oh. Well, you were just so friendly and… open. I was just wondering… This is a seedy place and you don’t know me…”

 

She cut me off “I was friendly, yeah, but that’s… That’s how you have to be. That’s like ‘customer service voice’. I don’t want to anger the strange man living next to me, you know?”

 

That made a lot of sense, I didn’t think of it that way.

 

She continued, “But I trust you now.”

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Yeah. I think you’re a good guy. I think you probably won’t kill me… What about me, do you trust me?”

 

“I mean… I’m still not 100% convinced you exist to be honest. I’ve still never seen you. You didn’t answer your door when I tried to say hi so… You might just be a figment of my imagination. Who’s to say?” I joked, but a part of me thought that would actually explain things.

 

“Wait when was this?” She sounded surprised.

 

“Oh, after we put up the sound proofing. I was gonna say hi when I got home from work, but you didn’t answer.”

 

“Really? Damn. I didn’t hear you.” She responded, sounding legitimately disappointed.

 

“Well that’s a first.” I joked.

 

Jane chuckled, “I know, right?”

 

I sighed, “Alright I gotta try to get some sleep tonight. Last night was fucking awful.”

 

“Yeah? I slept like a baby last night, these soundproofing things rule.”

 

…She slept like a baby? The image in my head of her sitting up in her bed replayed and gave me chills once again. Clearly, I must be mistaken. I shook off the thought.

 

“Well I still need to get used to it… Goodnight Jane.”

 

“Hear you later, Leigh.” That corny son of a bitch. She was serious about doing those jokes every day, wasn’t she?

 

I heard her get up and make her way to bed. A few minutes later and her side fell quiet. I crawled into my bed and I once again stared into the dark. Sleep still wasn’t coming easy. I dreaded this, but this time it only took about an hour to fall asleep, of which I was grateful. The silence still unsettled me.

 

Suddenly I awoke, still in the darkness – even deeper now. I don’t know what woke me up, but when I checked the clock, it was 2 am. I wasn’t happy. I tried to fall back to sleep, and it was slowly working until… I heard it again. That same deep bed creak. That unmistakeable sound of someone sitting up. Now I was fully awake.

 

Minutes past and I heard nothing else. Same as before. Like she was just… sitting there. This time however, I just had to know. I was confused, concerned, and pretty creeped out. So I just leaned close to the wall and whispered:

 

“Jane?”

 

Nothing happened at first. But then I heard the bed very slowly begin to creak again. Agonizingly slow and subtle. It sounded like she was… turning. Or at least adjusting her position in some way. I heard what sounded like her hands touching the wall, splayed out far apart on either side of me and then… I heard her breathing.

 

I could only hear her breathe before when we were sitting back-to-back against the wall, so she must have been pressed right up against it. Her breathing sounded different this time, though. It sounded hollow, like she had a cold. I was petrified. The hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. What was she doing? Was she even awake? What must she look like right now?

 

I just stared at the wall. Imagining her on the other side, pressed up against it like some feral thing. Was this really happening? Am I just too tired and loopy to be able to tell? Maybe the creaking was her laying back down and she’s just breathing heavier than normal because she’s asleep. I wanted to rationalize this so badly.

 

I waited for something else to happen, some other sound… I waited hours… But nothing did, and I was too scared to say anything else. Was she still there? Was she pressed against the wall all night long? I tried to get a little bit of sleep. I managed maybe 45 minutes but it was not pleasant.

 

I couldn’t focus on work the next day. I was tired, and I was so creeped out by what happened. I couldn’t think of an explanation. But I knew there had to be one. There had to be something. I couldn’t get the image out of my head, and every time that image replayed, she looked a little bit less human. I pictured her smiling a grotesque toothy grin. I imagined her drooling, her eyes open as wide as saucers, her fingers long and bony caressing the wall. None of this was rooted in reality, I knew that, but I couldn’t help but think of it.

 

I got back home and this time I hesitated before doing my customary knocks on the wall, but I did, and she returned them - same as always.

 

“I was just thinking… Mankind has made a lot of great inventions.”

 

“Jane...”

 

“But the dry-erase board has to be the most remarkable.”

 

I laughed. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to laugh at her jokes today, but I did. She’s still Jane. At least she seems to be. I was way overthinking.

 

“That one’s pretty good, I can’t lie.”

 

“You like it?” She asked, sounding proud of herself.

 

“I do... Hey I have to ask you something though.” I said, trying to remain at least somewhat casual.

 

“Shoot.”

 

“Do you… Sleepwalk?”

 

The other side went silent for a minute. “Um. No… Never in my life.” She responded, instantly sounding unnerved.

 

I fell silent too… I didn’t know how to explain. But she continued.

 

“That’s a scary ass question to ask out of nowhere. Did you hear something?”

 

“I heard… I don’t know exactly what I heard.”

 

“Stop. Don’t talk like that. Is this revenge for the corny jokes? I’ll stop the corny jokes. Don’t do this to me.” She pleaded in a half-joking manner.

 

“No, I promise I’m not messing with you - and it’s probably nothing. It’s just… You didn’t get up at all last night? Or the night before?”

 

“No, I did not get up at all. Please tell me what you heard.” She said firmly.

 

I told Jane everything that happened. I tried to be delicate, but also honest. I trusted that she didn’t know what was going on. That became evident to me by how freaked out she seemed. I know it sounded crazy, I just hope she didn’t think I was messing with her. It was difficult to tell from her tone.

 

Initially she wanted to debunk it all, saying that I must have heard something else – which I admitted could very well be true. Nevertheless, she told me she was going to stay with her sister for the night. Probably a good idea. She gave me her phone number and told me to call if anything happened. That put my mind at ease about whether or not she trusted me.

 

I told her to be safe, and she tried once again to reassure me that it was probably nothing, but I felt a sense of immense dread as soon as she left. Suddenly I really didn’t want to be alone here.

 

That night was the quietest of my life, and not in a good way. I thought about drowning it out by putting on some music or a movie, but nothing felt right.

 

I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to sleep that night, but eventually I managed. I ended up having a dream about a woman wearing a veil. through the veil I could vaguely make out three large black holes where her eyes and mouth should be. I couldn’t recall anything that happened in the dream… Only the image of that woman. I wondered if that was my subconscious way of trying to visualize Jane. I still didn’t know what she actually looked like so maybe my brain had trouble coming up with distinct features for her. Or maybe it was something else entirely.

 

It was still dark when I awoke from the dream. I felt a deep unease as I checked the time. 2 am, again. This time I wasn’t eager to fall back to sleep. I didn’t want to see the veiled woman again, so I stayed up a little while longer, attempting to ease my mind. I thought of every possible way to reassure myself. Eventually I began to fall into a façade of comfort, until…

 

Creak.

 

I went ice cold. No. This can’t be. I didn’t just hear that.

 

It was that same “sitting up” creak. But I heard Jane leave. Could she have come back late while I was sleeping? Maybe. But what if it isn’t her?

 

What if it was never her?

 

My mind raced. So many improbable scenarios played out in my mind. None of them were good. Was someone else in there with her the whole time and she didn’t know? Someone hiding away, only coming out when she’s sleeping? Was that creak her sitting up, or someone else sitting down? Do they watch her sleep?

 

All I knew for sure was that someone was on the other side of this wall. Because I could hear them breathing again.

 

I wanted to do something. I wanted to know for sure. But I was powerless. Calling out to it last time was the most horrific mistake of my life, I didn’t want to try that again. I wanted to call Jane but I was afraid of making a sound. Instead I just waited, and listened.

 

I was in a petrified daze. Hyperalert but also completely exhausted. My body wanted to shut down but my brain wouldn’t let me. It may have been minutes, or it may have been hours, I couldn’t tell. The image of the veiled woman kept reappearing in the back of my subconscious.

 

Eventually I decided to call Jane. If I heard a phone ring on the other side, then I would know. I typed the number in and hit call…

 

“The number you are trying to reach is not in service.” What? How could that be?

 

Suddenly, cutting through the silence was a sound I had become very familiar with, and yet was the one sound I was the least prepared for.

 

Knock Knock.

What broke us was the loss of trust and lies around his drinking driving a wedge between us, making me insane and anxious, and then finally he drove drunk and got a driving ban and a criminal record.

We've stayed in touch, with varying levels of intensity, at the moment it's checking in once a week and an occasional coffee.

Another long day of development ends in the twilight hours. The team has been working all day, incorporating the feedback from the Alpha testers. As day surrenders to night and the wind outside starts howling, one after another steps away from their workstations and seeks rest in their rooms in the old manor in the woods that moi rai games has rented for this Halloween work-vacation. As they say their goodbyes, Sersch shouts that he will quickly push the update live before going to bed. The hours pass, Sersch works and works, the cold white glare of his PC screen illuminating the dark room. Finally - Sersch pushes the update live at precisely midnight. Satisfied he makes his way to his room, clomping along the old wooden corridor.  
  
Not much time has passed when Sersch is abruptly torn away from his dreams. He wakes up to the persistent sound of Discord notifications. As he gets up to take a look at his PC, he sees the rest of the team, already up, standing around the big workstation table. He looks around and sees tired and noticeably nervous eyes. “We get flooded with the weirdest bug reports,” Aques Levaro says. Ntonisthier who is looking at his PC shakes his head in confusion. “Something seems to be very wrong with this update…”  
  
Outside the manor, the fog covers the landscape with a heaviness you could almost cut with a knife. This is going to be a long night…

# ""THE MONSTER BEHIND THE MONITOR""

Twinfox is sitting hunched over his desk, the dark room lit only by the cold glow of his monitor. Ever since the update went live he's been trying to make sense of all the bug reports that are coming in. His inbox is being flooded and each new report is stranger than the previous one. Just when he opens a new bug report, the silence in the room is interrupted by footsteps approaching the door.  
  
""Hey Lunate, do you know if Adam made any last minute changes for \[REDACTED\]?"" he calls out, not looking away from his screen.  
Lunate peeks into the room. ""Hm?""  
""I got a bunch of reports here claiming that a part of \[REDACTED\]'s Sprite is missing. Any idea why that might be?"" Twinfox asks and continues to scroll through the report without waiting for an answer. ""Also, I think \[REDACTED\] might be a bit too strong at the moment. Someone wrote, and I quote, 'My friend got absolutely slaughtered by the new monster'. Kind of weird that they sent that FOR their friend, right?"" He chuckles nervously. ""Anyway. I think Sersch added the new testing tools, so I think I'll just go and face \[REDACTED\] in combat myself to see what it's all about. What do you think?""  
Lunate takes a sip from his drink and smirks. ""Yeah, that sounds safe.""  
  
Without hesitation Twinfox starts the game and jumps straight into Forbidden Fortress. Cautiously he moves through the eerie corridors draped in cobwebs and dust. ""Man, it's so filthy here... How do other games keep their horror castles clean?"", he whispers to himself. Something is off today - the whole castle feels emptier than usual. ""Where is everyone? Shouldn't there be NPCs around here?"". He goes to the library, usually you can find Lily there. But the library was devoid of life.

A sound from outside makes Twinfox jump up from his desk. Is that... the clack of hooves on the street? He looks out the window. But all he sees is the foggy street, barely lit by the faint moon light. Shaking off a chill he turns back to the screen and ventures deeper into Forbidden Fortress.  
  
At last, Twinfox spots a familiar face. It's Sir Tiberion, the proud knight, who is huddled behind a stack of crates and looking anxiously at a worn map.  
""Sir Tiberion! Are you... hiding behind these crates?"" The knight looks up from his map. ""Oh, Bastian! Hiding? Who? Me? No, no..."" He glances over his shoulder. ""I'm just... between quests. Yes, that's it. I'm on my way to new adventures... Elsewhere... What is bringing you here?""  
""I just need to take a look at \[REDACTED\]. Have you seen it?"" Sir Tiberion visibly flinches. He takes a quick look around the room before leaning closer to Twinfox and lowering his voice to answer: ""I believe... it's down in the dungeons. Just follow the clatter of hooves.""  
""Thanks, Tiberion."" Twinfox starts to leave, but pauses when he sees the knight fumbling with his map. ""Oh, and Tiberion? The exit is back that way.""

https://preview.redd.it/mprxgzkyx2yd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=00e6ddabc2ceea3bcea675d03742d4dc1deb16a4

Again Twinfox is startled by a noise - a low, mocking laugh. This time it is a lot closer, somewhere in the room. With a pounding heart he turns around. There's no one there. The room is as empty as before. Scratching his head he turns back to the screen.  
  
Slowly walking through the dimly lit, winding halls of Forbidden Fortress he finally finds \[REDACTED\], waiting in the dungeons of Forbidden Fortress. The creature stands there with flickers of ghostly green flames dancing around it, casting ominous shadows on the wall. Its hollow eyes locked on him with a disturbing glint of intelligence behind them. ""Alright, let's find out what's behind all of these reports."" Twinfox mutters. He takes a deep breath and summons his team. ""Cherufe! Attack!""  
At first the combat seems to go as expected, but something feels off. \[REDACTED\] just shruggs off everything Twinfox' team throws at it. Then it starts laughing a slow, guttural laugh. ""That... sounds like..."" Twinfox gasps as he recognizes the laugh. It is the same laugh he heard in his room just moments ago.  
But the shock of the events that followed pulled Twinfox out of his thoughts again. Within seconds \[REDACTED\] launches into a final, brutal assault slicing through his team with surgical precision, leaving behind nothing but a trail of ghostly green flames and shards of Aether flying through the air, illuminating his screen with a sickly glow.  
  
Twinfox hastily tries to close the game, but nothing seems to respond. ""What the hell!? Come on..."" he says, hammering commands into his keyboard. But nothing works. Then suddenly the screen turns black.  
Twinfox is sitting at his desk, frozen, his mind racing. In the darkness of his monitor a reflection starts to form. Just behind his own wide-eyed face an eerie green glow becomes brighter. Just inches away from his shoulder he looks into a pair of hollow eyes with a demonic smile.

# ""THE GLITCH THAT CALLS""

Fabian sits alone at his desk in his room, the glow of his monitor casting long shadows across the dark corners of the old manor. The creaks and whispers of the aged building fill the air, blending with the gentle hum of his computer and the soft purring of his nearby cats. Outside, the wind rattles the window, adding to the eerie silence.  
A knock at the door breaks the quiet. It’s Manoah, poking his head in with an apologetic smile.  
""Hey, sorry to bother you so late, but… that bug’s back ever since Denis uploaded the new update. Forbidden Fortress is making crate sounds again. But… it’s different this time. You should hear it for yourself. I already checked the code, but it seems like it might be connected to Wwise… maybe?""  
  
With a frustrated sigh, Fabian pulls up the game, loading into the sinister corridors of the Forbidden Fortress. The torchlit halls flicker on his screen, and as he maneuvers his character through the dim, cobwebbed passageways, he braces for the familiar bugged sounds. But this time, something is undeniably wrong.  
Every step on the carpet, every creak of the fortress, every stumble caused by sticky webs—all carry that distorted “crate” sound, but there’s an edge to it. It’s not just a dull thud. No, it’s sharper… almost like a distant, echoing scream.

https://preview.redd.it/v3kydbo3y2yd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a37eb2da69d9bd251b835022ef8e9fc6df8c02db

Annoyed and a bit unsettled, Fabian shakes it off. “It’s just a bug,” he mutters, trying to convince himself. But the tension gnaws at him. He decides to take a break, and as he heads down the dimly lit hallway to the kitchen, his cats follow closely, sensing his unease. Just as he reaches for a glass of Caipirinha on the counter, it slips from his hand, shattering on the stone floor. The sound it makes is not the sharp crack of glass breaking.  
Instead, it’s the same eerie, hollow 'crate' sound from the game—the one that’s been haunting him. His cats dart away, startled, and just as he’s processing what happened, he hears footsteps behind him.  
It’s Lunate, drawn by the noise. He raises both eyebrows eyebrow as he sees Fabian standing over the shards of glass. “Is everything okay?” Lunate asks. “Yeah,” Fabi mutters, forcing a smile. “I’m… I’m just going to fix this stupid sound bug.” Lunate shakes his head. “Yeah, that sounds safe. I will make you another Caipirinha once I fixed this UI bug.”  
Feeling the weight of Lunate's words, Fabian returns to his room, determined. He launches back into the game, guiding his character through the fortress’s maze-like corridors. Each step feels heavier, his mind clouded, but he presses on, sure he can fix it and put this eerie feeling behind him.  
  
He steers his character toward another web-covered corner, but suddenly, the controls stop responding. Confused, Fabian tries pressing the keys again, but nothing happens. Then he realizes… he can’t move his left hand.  
Slowly, he looks down and freezes. His hand is wrapped in delicate, glistening strands of web. He tries to tear it away, but his other hand is also covered in the thick, sticky threads. Panic grips him as he realizes that his entire body is now bound tightly in webs, as if the fortress has reached out of the screen to claim him.  
He opens his mouth to scream, but the sound that escapes is not his own. It’s the same hollow, haunting scream he’s been hearing for hours.  
  
The screen flickers, and in the monitor’s dim reflection, he sees his own room—but something is missing. Yes, he is missing. One of his cats sits confused on his chair, looking around, while Fabian slowly becomes aware that he is now sitting on a cold, brick floor surrounded by high walls and a gloomy atmosphere.

# ""QA STANDS FOR QUESTIONABLE ADVENTURES""

Rilvenar must have gone through hundreds of bug reports at this point. The discord notifications on his cell phone have woken him up. There were too many and they didn't let him get back to sleep. So he starts reading, assigning and testing the bugs. Something wasn't quite right and he couldn't figure out where some of the bugs were coming from.

https://preview.redd.it/d9vanic6y2yd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78949e8b01c669af49bb8337f49fac0c39f69fa7

Rilvenar was chatting back and forth with the programmers to figure out why so many reports were being sent until his questions didn't get answered anymore. In fact nothing was getting answered anymore. And he spotted an even bigger issue: Bug reports were getting deleted.  
Something wasn't right, he could feel it. So he wanders down the corridors on his quest to find answers.  
  
The hallway is barely lit and all he could hear was distant typing on a keyboard. Until he hears steps right behind him. He slowly turns around and sees dozens of eyes staring back at him. After staring at the eyes for a split second, Rilvenar blinks and so do two of the other eyes. And then it hit him.  
”Lunate, why are you dressed up as a guaraná tree?” Rilvenar asks in disbelieve. “Oh, I was out on a boardgame halloween party but I saw how many issues we were having with the new update, so I came in to fix some UI stuff,” Lunate laughed, “What are you doing down this hall anyway?”  
“I wanted to check on the programmers, none of them seem to answer me.”  
“Yeah, that sounds safe,” Lunate nodded, “Anyway, I'll check back with you later, I have so many things to fix.” Lunate turned and walked into one of the barely lit offices.  
  
Rilvenar continues his way down the hall. The typing on the keyboard gets louder the closer to the end of the hallway he gets. He checks the first office: Nothing, just a computer in standby and a half-empty coffee cup. The second room looks similar, except for some papers on the floor with some sort of ... animal prints on them?  
He slowly moves to the last door and gently pushes it open. There was typing but he couldn't spot anyone. He glances at the floor. Dozens of ripped up, shredded bug reports with bite marks all over them or what was left of them. He had seen these before, right before they got deleted by someone.  
“Hey,” he said.  
Nothing.  
“Hey, you can't just delete reports, we still need to check them!”  
The chair slowly turns and two red eyes are staring right at him. Two red eyes that start growling, with a bug report still waiting to get torn up with its mouth. One second later it jumps towards Rilvenar. He dodges and starts running down the hallway as fast as he can. Trying not to bump into anything, he glances over his shoulder. A cat or a wolf? Maybe a dog? A schnauzer or a poodle perhaps? At the speed he was going he couldn't tell and he needed his focus elsewhere. He takes a turn into the break room and slams the door behind him.  
Rilvenar quickly pushes his back against the door before hearing a loud thud right behind him. Whatever was chasing him was stopped by the door and judging by the even louder growls afterwards, it isn't happy about it. He is scanning the room for anything he could use to keep the thing away from him, anything that could give him an advantage. He had almost decided on something, when he hears a loud “Shoo! Shoo! Go away!” from behind the door followed by banging on the floor and something running away.  
  
When he opens the door, he is looking into familiar eyes. Equipped with a children's bug net, Lunate must have fought off the evil spirit. “What was that? How did it get here?” Rilvenar turned towards the voice. Galina was standing next to Jorge with another children's bug net. “We should really get going and check on the others, this update is causing a lot of trouble,” Galina said, pointing towards the stairs to the first floor.  
As Rilvenar follows the others down the stairs, he stops for a moment to look back into the long corridor. He freezes when he sees two red glowing eyes in the corner and before he can make a move it takes a leap towards him and moments later red blood starts spilling out of where Rilvenar's hand should be.  
  
.....................  
  
“I can’t find Twinfox!” someone cries. “Do you guys also hear Fabian screaming??? Where is he?”, someone shouts. “What is this update?!?”, someone screams. The team is running around the manor. The last hours have been filled with chaos, screams, frantic typing.  
  
“What is happening?”, Sersch mumbles. Struck by the horrors he has witnessed happening to his team this night, Sersch desperately tries to find a solution. His hands are shaking while he is typing different commands pushing away the spine-chilling thoughts in his head. “There has to be a way!”, he shouts.  
Sersch stops for a second. Then… he makes a decision. He opens up Git Hub and with one click, he reverts the whole update - not even bewailing the work and time he and the others had put into this update. He just wants to save this team. As he pushes the button, the lamps in the room begin to shine brighter and brighter, blinding him. Suddenly, the lamps tune down and when Denis is able to see again, he finds his whole team back in the manor, safe and sound. They look at each other, glad they survived the horrors of game development. Through the window one can see the sun rising and fog lifting.

We bought a second hand Nespresso Lattissima coffee machine from Gumtree. They were a lovely old Scottish couple who welcomed my husband and I into their home and explained the machine and we bought it for £40. We came home and all the coffee we made tasted burnt. We first tried it in the capsules they gave us and then we bought Starbucks coffee. The capsules always taste burnt. We had it descaled twice, once with lemon and once with vinegar. The result was the same. We don't want to return the machine, it's not worth upsetting them for £40. Everyone recommends we try it with the original capsules, but there seems to be a Nespresso store in Edinburgh, but on maps it says it is permanently closed.  When I want to order from their website, they do not send less than 50 capsules.

1ggcg0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ggcg0p/morning_routine_for_pups/,Morning routine for pups?,"Hi all. I recently got a black lab puppy who really tests my limits but is the absolutely love of my life. He is 3 months old, and I am really struggling with mornings with him. He usually sleeps through the night, but lately has been whining to pee and poop between 4 and 530. He usually will settle after a bit and go to sleep until 6/630 but is absolutely crazy when he wakes up. He bites, chews everything, barks, etc. I live in New England in a wooded area so as of now when we wake up it’s still dark out and the animals are still lurking. So here is our current routine 

6/630: wake up, potty, and play - this is when he’s crazy and it can last an hour depending on the time he wakes up. I don’t even have time to pee in the morning. I wish I could let him run around at this time but I can’t. 
7: eat (half of his food in a slow feeder, the other half with a rolling dispenser for enrichment). Potty after eating. 
720: chewing on bones, playing, or getting into mischief. It’s light out by this time so we will usually go outside but I also need to pee, brush my teeth, make coffee, etc 
750: sit by open window and look outside 
8: train 
830: 1.5 mile walk 
9: teething time while I work 
930: first nap 

So is there anything else I should be implementing? He is so high energy and I am on the struggle bus and end everyday with a massive headache. Any tips in the morning when it’s too dark out to play?

1ggcdyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ggcdyt/my_wife_and_i_bought_a_beach_house_in_a_small/,"My wife and I bought a beach house in a small coastal town. Every night, our neighbors go for a swim in the freezing ocean. ","My wife and I recently moved to a beach house located on the rugged Pacific Northwest coastline. The cottage with yellow shutters opened out onto sand dunes leading to the ocean. We were surrounded by neighboring cottages each with the same yellow shutters. I worked remotely, and my wife was a painter. We felt it was time to leave the city and live in a quiet small town community. A place where we could reflect and appreciate our surroundings. 

We went on our first early morning dog walk with Barry along the oceanfront. It was a misty morning, and the waves lapped up onto the beach. It was perfect, a far cry from dog walks in small parks. We passed several dog walkers weaving in and out of the surf. I noticed that they were all barefoot. I slipped off my shoes and socks. I craved to feel the sand beneath my feet. I instantly felt the cold from the wet sand. A wave brushed over my feet. I grimaced. The water was freezing.

Alice looked at me. ""Are you okay?"" I faked a smile. ""Just a bit chilly.""

We continued walking along the shoreline and passed several more barefoot dog walkers. My legs were numb, but I was too embarrassed to let on. I thought to myself, how are they able to withstand the cold?

My wife looked at me again. ""Are you sure you're okay?"" The pain was now unbearable. ""Shall we explore the town?"" I quickly replied.

With my shoes and socks back on, we strolled through the small coastal town. There was a small bait shop and a hardware store, but not much else. My legs were still numb, and I needed to warm up. ""Shall we get something to drink?"" I suggested. ""Where?"" Alice replied.

We walked around for a while looking for a coffee shop but couldn't find one. We passed a middle-aged couple sitting on a bench gazing out at the ocean. 

I stopped and smiled. ""Excuse me, is there a coffee shop nearby?"" They continued to gaze out at the ocean. It was like they were in a trance. ""We've just moved here,"" I added.

Their eyes lit up. The lady pointed to a nearby street. ""Helen's tea room is right around the corner."" ""Thank you,"" I replied. The gentleman chuckled. ""That'll warm your legs up."" I was taken aback by his response. How did he know my legs felt like icicles?

We entered a quaint tea room decorated with nineteenth-century antique furniture. The place was packed with locals sitting together and drinking tea. They stopped talking and stared at us. My wife and I exchanged a look. ""We must look like tourists,"" I quipped.

A mysterious lady in her late seventies wearing a robe greeted us. My wife nervously smiled. ""You have a charming little place."" Helen frowned. ""Sorry, we are fully booked.""

I scanned the room and noticed an empty table in the corner. ""We've just moved here,"" I said. She stared at me. ""One of the cottages along the beach with the yellow shutters."" Helen's eyes lit up. ""Please come this way. Let's warm up those legs.""

Helen poured us a steaming cup of yellowish tea. ""Our special blend,"" she told us. ""Do you get many tourists here?"" Alice asked. ""They leave once it's too cold to swim,"" she replied. Helen left and poured the yellowish tea to another couple.

My wife and I looked at each other and took a sip. The locals watched. The warmth of the tea radiated through my body. I felt a tingling sensation in my legs. The numbness melted away.

Later that evening, I took a lukewarm shower and joined Alice in bed. She was asleep on top of the sheets. I opened the bedroom window slightly to let in the cool ocean breeze. It wasn't a hot night, but it felt humid.

Tossing and turning, I woke up to Barry's loud barking. I looked at my cell phone. It was two am. Barry continued to bark louder and louder. I entered the living room and switched on the lights. Barry was jumping up at the window, barking at something outside.

I tentatively went outside and picked up a beach stone. My heart was pounding through my chest. What if it was an intruder? Anyone could easily access our property via the beach. I saw a light coming from my neighbor's porch. To my surprise, my neighbor was rinsing off in his outdoor shower. I put down the stone and walked over. My neighbor, who was in his early forties, gym fit, wrapped a towel around his waist. He smiled and extended out his hand.

""I'm Jim. You must be our new neighbors."" I stared at him in disbelief. ""Jim, it's two am?"" He casually replied, ""Lovely evening for a dip.""

Surely, he didn't mean the ocean. It's like fifty degrees. You would get hypothermia.

Jim kept smiling. ""You're welcome to join us one night.""

I just stood there. He turned and went back into his beach house. A patch of salt water on his shoulder absorbed into his yellowish skin.

I struggled to go back to sleep. It was too hot, and my mind was racing. Did our crazy neighbor really invite us for a dip in the ocean?  

I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat. I wearily entered the living room and saw Alice outside on the deck in her nightgown, painting the ocean. I joined her. ""How long have you been up?"" I asked. ""I couldn't sleep. It was too muggy,"" she replied.

She began to paint a yellowish figure swimming in the ocean. I stared at the yellow figure.

""That's funny you should paint that. I spoke to our neighbor last night. He'd just got back from his nightly swim in the ocean.""

Alice looked up. ""Some people go Arctic swimming.""

Of course, Alice was right. But the whole encounter still seemed odd.

All day, I couldn't stop thinking about my strange interaction with the neighbor. He seemed so relaxed. Why wasn't he shivering? Why was his skin the same yellowish color as in my wife's painting?

That evening, I waited up. I had to see with my own eyes if my neighbor went for a swim in the ocean. I was getting tired and nodded off in my deck chair. I awoke to voices coming from the ocean.

I crept down to the shoreline. It was pitch black except for a yellowish glow shining off the water. To my utter shock, my neighbors were swimming and bathing in the freezing ocean. Some were diving under the water while others floated on their backs. I crouched behind a sand dune, trying to stay hidden. Jim stood up in the water, and I caught his eye. He smiled and waved for me to join them. I ran as fast as I could back to my beach house. I could hear them splashing in the waves from behind.

I locked the doors and closed the shutters. I was sweating profusely. I thought to myself, this is insane. There is no way I could join them. I wouldn't survive.  

As the weeks passed, we became more settled in. We went on long beach walks with Barry and paddled our feet in the waves. There were still a few tourists around. I remembered thinking, will they ever leave us in peace? We regularly stopped off at Helen's tea room and even bought our own supply of yellow tea.

Every night, my wife and I went down to the shore and watched the neighbors enjoying their nightly swim. I was no longer afraid of the freezing ocean, but despite welcoming smiles from our neighbors, I still wasn't ready to venture in.

One dark winter evening, I joined my wife for a cold shower. The water felt warm on our skin. After we got out of the shower, we were dry almost immediately. I looked in the mirror and saw a yellowish glow radiate through our naked bodies. That night, we couldn't sleep. We were burning up, and our skin was red hot to the touch. Alice and I looked at each other and knew exactly what we needed to do.

In our swimwear, we walked hand in hand through the sand dunes and joined our neighbors in the ocean. Our neighbors smiled at us and carried on swimming. As I submerged into the ocean, the freezing water soothed my flaming skin. I bathed and splashed around. I was in a state of euphoria.  

Over the next several nights, we joined our neighbors in the ocean. It was the highlight of my day. The thought of the ice-cold water hitting my skin and the feeling of truly belonging was intoxicating. It consumed my every waking moment.

One evening, as we prepared for our nightly swim by taking an ice bath and drinking the yellow tea on the deck, we saw a group of young travelers on the beach, sitting around a campfire. My wife and I frowned. How dare they spoil our perfect evening.

As we walked down to the shore, an argument erupted between our neighbors and the travelers. There was lots of swearing back and forth. The neighbors engulfed the travelers and to my shock, dragged them into the ocean. The travelers were screaming and thrashing about as they were held under the freezing water. I ran into the ocean, but it was too late. Everything went silent. The travelers were floating face-down. I desperately tried to pull their lifeless bodies back to the shore, but the tide was too strong. The neighbors bathed and swam like nothing ever happened.

Back at our beach house, my wife and I were panicking. ""We need to call the cops,"" Alice cried. ""It would be our word against the neighbors,"" I exclaimed.

There's no way the cops would believe our nightly swims and our resistance to the freezing ocean. It would be ruled a tragic accident involving drunk tourists.

The next morning, we woke up on the bathroom tiles. We couldn't sleep as we were burning up and needed to take turns going in and out of the shower. I went outside to get some fresh air and saw Jim setting off for his morning run. He smiled at me. How can he possibly smile? Does he even realize that he murdered innocent people last night?

My wife and I decided to clear our heads and take Barry on a long walk. I couldn't help but look at the majestic scenery. The jagged cliffs and the waves crashing against the boulders. There was a brief moment where I forgot about last night. As we walked back, we passed a young family with a five-year-old little girl.

The mother politely asked, ""Is there anywhere that sells ice cream?"" ""It's not summer!"" I abruptly answered.

The mother and father exchanged a look and continued on. Their daughter looked upset. It then dawned on me that I was becoming like my neighbors and that they were in danger. I quickly caught up to them.

""You need to leave!"" The family hurried away from me. I shouted out, ""It's not safe for tourists!""

That evening, we decided to not go for our nightly swim. How could we after what we witnessed? We stayed in our ice bath, but the temperature kept rising, and the water started to boil. We were getting cooked alive and had no choice but to go into the ocean.

""One little swim,"" I said.

We quickly headed down to the shore and entered the ocean. We avoided our neighbors who swam and bathed in what might as well have been the traveler's blood. My wife and I swam for our lives, desperately trying to get the heat off us.

Eventually, we cooled down and swam back to the shore, where we heard a muffled cry. Our neighbors were dragging the young family kicking and screaming from a nearby beach house they were renting.

The neighbors savagely submerged the mother and father. I swam over as fast as I could and tried to fight them off, but they held me back. They were too possessed, their eyes bright yellow.

The little girl was left struggling to stay afloat, her arms and legs no longer able to move in the freezing water. The mother and father stopped fighting and went limp.

With her last gasp, the mother cried out to me, ""Save her!""

The little girl was taken under by a large wave. I dived deep into the water and saw her lifeless body sinking to the seabed. I grabbed her arm and pulled her to the shore. My wife and I carried the unconscious little girl to our beach house. In the background, the neighbors continued to bathe and swim with smiles on their faces.

Back at the beach house, we laid the little girl down on the couch. She had gone blue and was hyperventilating. I wrapped her up in sheets, but she was still unresponsive.

""We need to call 911!"" Alice cried. ""There's no time!"" I replied.

I looked over to the pot of tea on the kitchen counter. I gently poured the tea down her throat. A yellow glow passed through her veins. We waited with bated breath. Her eyes flashed open.

Even after witnessing our neighbor's ritual killings, we could never leave the beach house. We needed our nightly swims to survive. The little girl became our daughter. She was too young to remember what happened, and now that she's older, she even goes swimming in the ocean with her friends.

Every day, my wife and I walk Barry along the oceanfront, and if we see a tourist, we warn them to leave.

But after a few rounds of benzodiazepines it was much much better. I still felt like shit at the end of that day, but also so thankful that the horrible anxiety was gone. 

Second day I got one or two benzos, and that was fine. Still a little wobbly and shaky, but I could drink without the glass shaking too much. 

Today my hands don’t shake much worse than like someone who has had a few cups of coffee too many. My eyes have a blank wetness still. I sweat extremely fast, and I might be imagining it, but there’s this smell that lingers on me. 

Mentally I’m a bit woozy and distant, a bit off. Some of that might be the sleeping meds and benzos still in my system. The red face and hands are just about completely gone. I feel mildly sick and fatigued.

I smoked for 10 years (age 14) and then used Velo/Zyn for 2.5 years and i tried to quit so many times but always ended up using it again after a couple of weeks to a month. 

Tapering down does NOT work for me so all my attempts including this one were straight cold turkey. 

First couple of weeks were fucking depressing and the lack of sleep drove me crazy but i knew it was temporary and i knew i could bitch about it all i want on reddit so that was comforting lol

I was a bit drowsy the first month but not so much that it stopped my life to a halt. In to the second month, it all happened so fast and i don’t remember much of it tbh because there was allot of mental cravings. 

How did i release frustration? 

1. Nicotine free pouches for the first month, only when i had severe cravings. 
2. Working out. Can’t stress this enough. 
3. Martial arts if you’re into that, totally helps
4. Call of duty hahaha 

I went out drinking with friends on a couple of occasions (they use zyn) and my mind tempted me for a second but i kept reminding myself “it’s just a voice in your head. You wont feel better if you took one” 

You just gotta realize it’s an addiction cycle, nothing more and nothing less. You use, you’re addicted, you don’t, you’re free. 

Zyn/snus does NOT enhance your life in any way. 

Caffeine: although sure it did add to the anxiety, i did not cut down on it because that’s my go to “feel good” habit. Like fuck, you gotta have SOME fun in life 😅😅 i’m drinking a coffee rn lol 

However i did notice that coffee in particular became less interesting since i quit. It just doesn’t bring the same pleasure it once did. 

Month 2-3: mild mental cravings here and there but it did spike on a couple of occasions due to heavy stress but then again, just had to remind myself it’s not the solution. 

I’ve been hearing stuff like i look better than ever, i’m packing muscles, i’m mentally sharper, more energetic and overall more focused.

I set my alarm for 6:30a so I could have some peace and quiet in the house before the hustle and bustle of the morning routine, and my kids decided to beat me in their wake up time. Now I’m sitting downstairs having my coffee while they cry in their rooms (not screaming, btw- I’m not a monster). I’m refusing to get them right now (I can see on their monitors that they’re safe and fine) because im seething with rage. Why the fuck are they awake? Why can’t I get a single moment of peace in my GD house? 

It’s just been a lot recently. I have two boys, 4 & 2. My 4 year old has really struggled adjusting to his new pre k room at his daycare, and I’m starting to suspect potentially mild autism or possibly ADD, and I’m concerned. We’ll talk to his pediatrician soon. He’s hit most of his social milestones late, but he IS ultimately hitting them, so maybe it’s fine? I’m just dealing with accepting the fact that he’s different than the other kids. I’m not celebrating the same things that my friends with kids of similar ages are, and that’s a struggle for me. 

My two year is just, well, two. I think that’s all that needs to be said there lol we’re working on developing some “consequences” for breaking boundaries. Time outs are very effective for my older child, but my two year old doesn’t seem affected by them. Maybe he’s too young to get it still? And I feel like I’m under a microscope because out of my siblings, I’m the only parent choosing to parent differently than they are, so I feel this extra pressure for my kids to be well behaved and if they’re not, then I’m definitely wrong- ya know? 

And lastly, I just hate my body, and I’m tired of hating my body. I’m 33, 5”2, 145-150 pounds (it fluctuates so damn much). I’ve been working out with a trainer for two years now, 3 days a week. I train pretty hard, lift heavy weights and such, and I track my food with a focus on protein instead of straight calories. Through all of this I still have a fucking gut or a mommy pooch and I just can’t stand it. I have an ab class I’ve been doing to target that, but whatever. I weigh myself in the morning and look in the mirror and am instantly angry for the remainder of the day. I don’t have a lifestyle where I can move my body intentionally every single damn day- the 3 days I’m already doing feel impressive to me. Why does it need to be more? What am I missing that would just get rid of my damn gut? I just want to look in the mirror and be happy. Idk if that’s a thing that will happen for me. 

These are all mostly petty grievances I suppose, but they’re adding up to an unpleasant mood most days. Ultimately I have a lot to be happy about. My husband and I do okay financially, my kids are over the illness hump at daycare so we’re all healthy, my husband and I are strong in our marriage despite early morning spats that are fueled only by exhaustion and no real malice, and I have a strong village of support around me. I talk to a therapist every other week, which sort of helps. I just want to be a person who wakes up and is happy and patient and has butterflies coming out of my ass. But maybe that’s not possible for me? Idk. 

Thanks for reading my bitch session if you made it this far ❤️ just helps to get the words out. ",9,1730373563.0,workingmoms,3,0.91,False

1ggc0gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ggc0gu/just_wrapped_up_sg/,Just wrapped up SG,"Just left Changi after spending 3 incredible days in SG. The country is clean, advanced, modern, well maintained and organized. Moving around the city in MRT is mad convenient and the 3 day EZ-link card was absolutely worth it. After using the MRT over 30 times, the $27 price tag was a great deal. However, the weather is absolutely miserable even though I managed to walk 42 miles, drenched in sweat. 

Quick Recap:

Day 1 

Arrive at Changi
Buy 3-day ez-link
Take MRT to Bugis (my hotel)
Checkin n freshen up
Head to Bugis junction for lunch - Chix Rendang with coffee float
Walk around Bugis Junction
Exchange $$$ at Bugis
Walk to Boat Quay n Clarke Quay 
It was very hot so not many ppl around. Had some beers by the canal. 
Back to hotel, quick nap
Evening - head to Chinatown
Chinatown was very underwhelming so decided to head to Bodek 85 market to eat Fu zhou oyster cake, Seng Hiang Bak Chor Me. 
Head to Lau Pa Sat - unbelievable vibe 
Grab couple of beers to cool off
Experience Satay street - tasty chicken, mutton, shrimp satay
Head to Geylang - very underwhelming and run down, looked like lil Bangladesh. 
Head back to hotel by 1am. 

Day 2
Breakfast - Kaya toast at Ya Kun. This was so delicious, the coffee is not something I have had before. 
Head to Sri Krishnan and Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple on Waterloo. 
Head to MBS. 
Spent about 2-3 hrs  around MBS and Gardens by the Bay. Again, very hot but had a blast looking at these beautiful spots. The skywalk to see the Gardens and MBS is a must even though it can be terrifying. 
Head back to Lau Pa Sat, grab some beers and hawker food. 
Back to hotel to relax n shower. 
Head in the evening to Haw Per Villa, took me 1-2 hours. After that I hit the night Safari which took another 1-2 hrs. The heat was too much so left for my Crab dinner. 
Black pepper crab at Hua Ya Wee was top notch. As a solo traveler, it was weird to eat alone and 5 mins in and a Tiger beer later, I was fine. 
The crab paired with beef Hor Fun was a 10/10. 
After dinner, headed to Little India to see the Diwali lights. I stopped by Sri Srinivasan Temple. Little India was crowded as everyone was out shopping. Walked around for an hour and then got back to the hotel again around midnight. Another shower. 

Day 3
Another day and another Kaya toast breakfast at Ya Kun. 
Then I headed back to Chinatown to check out the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. 
Too hot so I headed back to Bugis to cool off to some Chendol. 
Then I headed to Newton Market to taste some Sambal Stingray,  bbq chic wings. stingray was absolute dynamite. 
Since this was my last day, head back to hotel to pack up. 
In the evening, I headed to Arab Street. It had great vibes and Haji Ln was popping with Halloween Parties. Grabbed some beers n Kunafe to end the night. 
Back to the hotel around midnight. 

Day 4 
Depart at 7am. 

All in all I had an incredible trip. The weather was pretty bad which sometimes made it miserable. The AC in the malls is helpful. Multiple showers, juices n coconut crème kept me going. 
People were usually not friendly nor they spoke English, from kids to older ppl. The ones who dressed professionally spoke English and were quite helpful. It feels like everywhere I went, ppl spoke Chinese, felt like suburbs of Beijing. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Indians were friendly, the other Asians won’t even look at you when you try to ask them something or say excuse me. 
I had a lotta fun and The food was the highlight just like my every other trip.  
Thanks to this group for all your tips. Until next time. 🇸🇬 ❤️

1ggbzvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1ggbzvr/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1730373312.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I feel great, my brain fog is gone, and the usual aches and pains disappeared, so it’s good just for that, but I need to lose this weight.

**Here’s my diet outline:**

Two meals comprising eggs, ground beef, bacon, a little cheese, pork shoulder and lamb shoulder. My mainstay is sirloin steak, usually two medium cuts that I cook in the air fryer and leave to stand with butter on top.

I drink Americano coffee with milk, say 4 cups, and use dry seasoning on my meat (sugar-free) and mustard (also sugar-free). 

I drink around twice a week, a couple of long drinks, spirits and soda water.

**Exercise**

I have a desk job, but I walk a fair bit and swim a couple of times a week. 

When I think of what I used to eat, an absolute carb addict, I feel the weight should be falling off like crazy, but my body is just hanging on to this fat, and I don’t know what I need to do. I appreciate any help you can give.",1,1730373167.0,carnivorediet,10,0.67,False

1ggbxfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ggbxfz/i_28m_accidentally_started_dating_my_workplace/,I (28M) accidentally started dating my workplace nemesis (27F) and don’t know how to tell her So here’s the situation:,"I work in marketing for a mid-sized company, and for the past year, I’ve had this one coworker who drives me up the wall. Let's call her Alex. She joined our team about a year ago, and from day one, she was just...too much. Always jumping in on my projects, challenging my ideas in meetings, and getting way too competitive over who our boss liked better. The vibe was mutual—whenever we had to work together, it was tense, and it was like we were constantly trying to one-up each other. I’d find myself thinking about comebacks to things she said in last week’s meeting. It was that bad.

Anyway, a couple of months ago, our company has this mandatory team-building offsite in the middle of nowhere. They divided us into pairs for a scavenger hunt “bonding activity,” and guess who my partner was? Yep, Alex. I tried to trade, but it was set in stone. I figured I’d just put up with her for a couple of hours, keep things civil, and get through it.

But then things started getting...weirdly fun. The scavenger hunt required teamwork, so we kind of had no choice but to work together, and somehow, without even trying, we started clicking. She was sarcastic and quick-witted, and before I knew it, we were making each other laugh. Turns out, she’s way less intense when she’s not, you know, arguing against my every idea. By the end of the hunt, we’d gotten totally lost, given up, and found a coffee shop in town where we hung out for hours. I got to see this completely different side of her, and I honestly didn’t want it to end.

After the offsite, I found myself thinking about her. A lot. The tension at work...it was still there, but it had changed. We’d still challenge each other, but it was more playful and kind of exciting? One Friday, after a long week, I asked if she wanted to grab a drink “as colleagues”—not a date, obviously (I was still pretending I didn’t like her). She said yes, and we ended up talking until the bar closed. That night, I kissed her.

Here’s the problem: for weeks now, we’ve been...well, dating. But we haven’t really talked about it. Neither of us has acknowledged the fact that, until recently, we couldn’t stand each other. I’m falling for her hard, and I think she feels the same way, but neither of us wants to be the first to bring it up.

This week, it’s been a lot harder to hide it at work. My other coworkers are starting to notice the shift between us, and I know people are whispering about it. My boss even asked if we were “finally working things out.” I brushed it off, but honestly, I’m waiting for the day someone flat-out asks if we’re together. The worst part? I’m not sure what I’d even say, because I don’t know what she’d say.

I want to tell her how I feel, but I’m scared I’ll ruin whatever’s happening between us. I don’t know if she’s still playing it cool, or if she’s as terrified as I am that we’ll screw it up.

TL;DR: After a year of hating my coworker, we started dating...kind of by accident? Now we’re awkwardly trying to be a couple without acknowledging that we were enemies first, and I’m scared I’ll ruin everything by bringing it up.

I've \[M33\] been seeing this guy\[M36\] as a FWB for about 4 months now - standard hook-up turns into ""we should do this again"", turns into ""what are we doing together this Saturday?"". I think we've seen each other every week, sometimes multiple times, lots of texting, we've gone on some great dates, a couple of bad ones we can laugh at, and I've fallen asleep in his bed spooning him a couple of times now. It's all very cute and wholesome.

We both had LTR's (10+years ea) fall apart at the start of this year and started out with the understanding that neither of us is looking for a relationship right now. I've been fucking anything that breathes (I'm being stereotypically bisexual and he knew about it) and as far as I understand was spending a lot of time drunk on his own.

So a fortnight ago, he's a bit cold and wishy washy with me over text. I'd been so fucking suave up until that point, but the moment he seems a bit disinterested in me I loose my fucking cool and start worrying - I had told him I couldn't stay over weeknights because I can't go to work without coffee and vegemite on toast, he buys coffee and vegemite for me, I mean, I don't have a toothbrush in his bathroom but that's like the same right? Does this mean he wants to be serious and is he acting cold to me because I'm not reciprocating enough? Turns out no, he just had a bad day for other things, I wasn't forefront of his mind, but I'd already made up my mind that I was going to ask him if he wanted to be exclusive next time I saw him.

So that's what I did. When I saw him a couple days later I told him we were really great for each other and asked if I could call him my boyfriend.

He asked me if I was really ready for that, and I said I wasn't sure but I'd like to try. He said he wasn't sure either and didn't want to be hurt again. He made a point of me sleeping around a bunch. In fact he made that point several times. We ended up agreeing that what we had was a lot of fun, and we should keep at it for a bit longer. I'm pleased I asked and now he knows we could have something together. I start telling people I was seeing on the side that I'm trying to do something else now (mostly super well received).

This week, I get Covid, bad one, and get laid up in bed. Two days into it, my penis gets sick too and it's textbook gonorrhea. FUCK! I'd been ignoring a sore throat for weeks because every man and his dog that I knew has had some cold or flu recently but that fits the profile too. I've never fucked without a rubber but I've never sucked with one so that's what you get for being active.

So hey! how do you think those messages went down? - Monday: ""Hey I had covid, it's not an easy one, don't know who I got it from but watch out for symptoms"" - Wednesday: ""Hey now i have gonorrhea too, probably carried it a while, you should get tested""

I got ""Thanks for letting me know, tells me I was right in what i said to you"" there was a bit more. It was all very polite and civil. no😘, no x's.

I feel like absolute garbage. I'm sick... leaking out my nose and my dick. I opened myself up and now I don't know if he wants to see me again. I'm pretty sure I've just validated a negative opinion he had of me (maybe rightfully so). It's embarrassing spreading the word that you picked up something, I know it's necessary, it still sucks. It especially sucks after rejecting them on the pretense that you're not sleeping around anymore.

Anyway, just needed to vent. Been a rough week. I'll see what pieces I can pick up of it next week.",1,1730372969.0,gayrelationships,1,0.67,False

I'm so proud.

(The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)

ADAM:

\- We're starting work today!



BARRY:

\- Today's the day.

ADAM:

Come on! All the good jobs

will be gone.

BARRY:

Yeah, right.

JOB LISTER:

Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,

stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

\- Is it still available?

JOB LISTER:

\- Hang on. Two left!

 :

One of them's yours! Congratulations!

Step to the side.

ADAM:

\- What'd you get?

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

\- Picking crud out. Stellar!

(He walks away)

ADAM:

Wow!

JOB LISTER:

Couple of newbies?

ADAM:

Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

JOB LISTER:

Make your choice.

(Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly

changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very

confusing)



ADAM:

\- You want to go first?

BARRY:

\- No, you go.

ADAM:

Oh, my. What's available?

JOB LISTER:

Restroom attendant's open,

not for the reason you think.

ADAM:

\- Any chance of getting the Krelman?

JOB LISTER:

\- Sure, you're on.

(Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head)

(Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)

 :

I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

(Takes Adam's hat off)

Wax monkey's always open.

ADAM:

The Krelman opened up again.

 :

What happened?

JOB LISTER:

A bee died. Makes an opening. See?

He's dead. Another dead one.

 :

Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

 :

Dead from the neck up.

Dead from the neck down. That's life!



ADAM:

stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

 :

lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

 :

(Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)

 :

Barry!

POLLEN JOCK:

in quadrant nine...

ADAM:

What happened to you?

Where are you?

BARRY:

\- I'm going out.

ADAM:

\- Out? Out where?

BARRY:

\- Out there.

ADAM:

\- Oh, no!

BARRY:

I have to, before I go

to work for the rest of my life.

ADAM:

(Barry hangs up)

Hello?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Another call coming in.

 :

If anyone's feeling brave,

there's a Korean deli on 83rd

 :

that gets their roses today.

BARRY:

Hey, guys.

POLLEN JOCK #1 ==

\- Look at that.

POLLEN JOCK #2:

\- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

LOU LO DUVA:

Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

(Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)

LOU LO DUVA:

(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

BEE WITH CLIPBOARD:

(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.

 :

\- Thank you.

LOU LO DUVA:

\- OK.

 :

You got a rain advisory today,

 :



and as you all know,

bees cannot fly in rain.

 :

So be careful. As always,

watch your brooms,

 :

hockey sticks, dogs,

birds, bears and bats.

 :

Also, I got a couple of reports

of root beer being poured on us.

 :

Murphy's in a home because of it,

babbling like a cicada!

BARRY:

\- That's awful.

LOU LO DUVA:

(Still talking through megaphone)

\- And a reminder for you rookies,

 :

bee law number one,

absolutely no talking to humans!

 :

All right, launch positions!

POLLEN JOCKS:

(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)

 :

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,

buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

LOU LU DUVA:

Black and yellow!

POLLEN JOCKS:



Hello!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(To Barry)You ready for this, hot shot?

BARRY:

Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

POLLEN JOCK's:

Wind, check.

 :

\- Antennae, check.

\- Nectar pack, check.

 :

\- Wings, check.

\- Stinger, check.

BARRY:

Scared out of my shorts, check.

LOU LO DUVA:

OK, ladies,

 :

let's move it out!

 :

Pound those petunias,

you striped stem-suckers!

 :

All of you, drain those flowers!

(The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)

BARRY:

Wow! I'm out!

 :

I can't believe I'm out!

 :

So blue.



 :

I feel so fast and free!

 :

Box kite!

(Barry flies through the kite)

 :

Wow!

 :

Flowers!

(A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to

heat sink goggles.)

POLLEN JOCK:

This is Blue Leader.

We have roses visual.

 :

Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

 :

Roses!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

 :

Stand to the side, kid.

It's got a bit of a kick.

(The pollen jock fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that

suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)

BARRY:

That is one nectar collector!

POLLEN JOCK #1==

\- Ever see pollination up close?

BARRY:

\- No, sir.

POLLEN JOCK #1:



(Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles

pollen as he goes)

 :

I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it

over here. Maybe a dash over there,

 :

a pinch on that one.

See that? It's a little bit of magic.

BARRY:

That's amazing. Why do we do that?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

That's pollen power. More pollen, more

flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

BARRY:

Cool.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.

could be daisies. Don't we need those?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Copy that visual.

 :

Wait. One of these flowers

seems to be on the move.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Say again? You're reporting

a moving flower?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Affirmative.

(The Pollen jocks land near the ""flowers"" which, to the audience are

obviously just tennis balls)

KEN:

(In the distance) That was on the line!



POLLEN JOCK #1:

This is the coolest. What is it?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

 :

It smells good.

Not like a flower, but I like it.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Yeah, fuzzy.

(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)

POLLEN JOCK #3==

Chemical-y.

(The pollen jock finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

(The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of

one of the tennis balls)

POLLEN JOCK #2:

My sweet lord of bees!

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Candy-brain, get off there!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(Pointing upwards)

Problem!

(A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck

to)

BARRY:

\- Guys!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

\- This could be bad.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Affirmative.

(Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick

to it)



BARRY==

Very close.

 :

Gonna hurt.

 :

Mama's little boy.

(Barry is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is

still stuck to the ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

You are way out of position, rookie!

KEN:

Coming in at you like a MISSILE!

(Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)

BARRY:

(In slow motion)

Help me!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't think these are flowers.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

\- Should we tell him?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

\- I think he knows.

BARRY:

What is this?!

KEN:

Match point!

 :

You can start packing up, honey,

because you're about to EAT IT!

(A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way

with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)

BARRY:



Yowser!

(Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies

into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)

BARRY:

Ew, gross.

(The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry

into the car)

GIRL IN CAR:

There's a bee in the car!

 :

\- Do something!

DAD DRIVING CAR:

\- I'm driving!

BABY GIRL:

(Waving at Barry)

\- Hi, bee.

(Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl)

GUY IN BACK OF CAR:

\- He's back here!

 :

He's going to sting me!

GIRL IN CAR:

Nobody move. If you don't move,

he won't sting you. Freeze!

(Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)

 :

GRANDMA IN CAR==

He blinked!

(The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car,

climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)

GIRL IN CAR:

Spray him, Granny!

DAD DRIVING THE CAR:

What are you doing?!

(Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above



the ground, safe.)

BARRY:

Wow... the tension level

out here is unbelievable.

(Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds

moving into this direction)

 :

I gotta get home.

 :

Can't fly in rain.

 :

Can't fly in rain.

(A rain drop hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)

 :

Can't fly in rain.

(A second rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards)

Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

(WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a

plant inside an apartment near the window)

VANESSA BLOOME:

Ken, could you close

the window please?

KEN==

Hey, check out my new resume.

I made it into a fold-out brochure.

 :

You see?

(Folds brochure resume out)

Folds out.

(Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside)

BARRY:

Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)

 :

What was that?



(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back

because the window is closed)

Maybe this time. This time. This time.

This time! This time! This...

 :

Drapes!

(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)

That is diabolical.

KEN:

It's fantastic. It's got all my special

skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

ANDY:

What's number one? Star Wars?

KEN:

Nah, I don't go for that...

(Ken makes finger guns and makes ""pew pew pew"" sounds and then stops)

 :

...kind of stuff.

BARRY:

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.

They're out of their minds.

KEN:

When I leave a job interview, they're

flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

BARRY:

(Looking at the light on the ceiling)

There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)

 :

I don't remember the sun

having a big 75 on it.

(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the

humans are sitting at)

KEN:



I predicted global warming.

 :

I could feel it getting hotter.

At first I thought it was just me.

(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and

is about to put it in his mouth)

 :

Wait! Stop! Bee!

(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans

freak out)

 :

Stand back. These are winter boots.

(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but

Vanessa saves him last second)

VANESSA:

Wait!

 :

Don't kill him!

(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)

KEN:

You know I'm allergic to them!

This thing could kill me!

VANESSA:

Why does his life have

less value than yours?

KEN:

Why does his life have any less value

than mine? Is that your statement?

VANESSA:

I'm just saying all life has value. You

don't know what he's capable of feeling.

(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can

carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)

KEN:



My brochure!

VANESSA:

There you go, little guy.

(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is

still shocked that a human saved his life)

KEN:

I'm not scared of him.

It's an allergic thing.

VANESSA:

Put that on your resume brochure.

KEN:

My whole face could puff up.

ANDY:

Make it one of your special skills.

KEN:

Knocking someone out

is also a special skill.

(Ken walks to the door)

Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

 :

\- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?

VANESSA:

\- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

 :

(Vanessa tries to close door)

KEN==

\- You could put carob chips on there.

VANESSA:

\- Bye.

(Closes door but Ken opens it again)

KEN:

\- Supposed to be less calories.



VANESSA:

\- Bye.

(Closes door)

(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies

into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)

BARRY==

(Talking to himself)

I gotta say something.

 :

She saved my life.

I gotta say something.

 :

All right, here it goes.

(Turns back)

Nah.

 :

What would I say?

 :

I could really get in trouble.

 :

It's a bee law.

You're not supposed to talk to a human.

 :

I can't believe I'm doing this.

 :

I've got to.

(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by

again)

 :

Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

 :

No. Yes. No.

 :

Do it. I can't.



 :

How should I start it?

(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)

""You like jazz?""

No, that's no good.

(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)

Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

 :

...Hi!

(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the

counter)

 :

I'm sorry.

VANESSA:

\- You're talking.

BARRY:

\- Yes, I know.

VANESSA:

(Pointing at Barry)

You're talking!

BARRY:

I'm so sorry.

VANESSA:

No, it's OK. It's fine.

I know I'm dreaming.

 :

But I don't recall going to bed.

BARRY:

Well, I'm sure this

is very disconcerting.

VANESSA:

This is a bit of a surprise to me.

I mean, you're a bee!



BARRY:

I am. And I'm not supposed

to be doing this,

(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)

but they were all trying to kill me.

 :

And if it wasn't for you...

 :

I had to thank you.

It's just how I was raised.

(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)

 :

That was a little weird.

VANESSA:

\- I'm talking with a bee.

BARRY:

\- Yeah.

VANESSA:

I'm talking to a bee.

And the bee is talking to me!

BARRY:

I just want to say I'm grateful.

I'll leave now.

(Barry turns to leave)

VANESSA:

\- Wait! How did you learn to do that?

BARRY:

(Flying back)

\- What?

VANESSA:

The talking...thing.

BARRY:



Same way you did, I guess.

""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.

VANESSA:

\- That's very funny.

BARRY:

\- Yeah.

 :

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,

we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

 :

Anyway...

VANESSA:

Can I...

 :

...get you something?

BARRY:

\- Like what?

VANESSA:

I don't know. I mean...

I don't know. Coffee?

BARRY:

I don't want to put you out.

VANESSA:

It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

 :

\- It's just coffee.

BARRY:

\- I hate to impose.

(Vanessa starts making coffee)

VANESSA:

\- Don't be ridiculous!



BARRY:

\- Actually, I would love a cup.

VANESSA:

Hey, you want rum cake?

BARRY:

\- I shouldn't.

VANESSA:

\- Have some.

BARRY:

\- No, I can't.

VANESSA:

\- Come on!

BARRY:

I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

VANESSA:

\- Where?

BARRY:

\- These stripes don't help.

I'm on my second try in recent weeks. I bailed on the first one because my insomnia increased and I couldn't deal with it. It is better to know that this is very common. My question for the board is whether this is more a circadian rhythm and hormone issue, or more like a physical detox, or both?

I'm wondering if this difference would have impacts on faster reduction in this pesky increase in insomnia. Or maybe do both anyway, meaning -

If circadian rhythm and hormones then timing and degree of light exposure and overall hormone status will be faster path to better sleep. But when I drank coffee I never craved it at 4 pm or woke up at 2 am with same. Do I need more 20 hour fasts, sauna, skin brushing, and liver & kidney support? How else to detox faster other than a lot of water to flush out of system?

And ya, exercise. I'm on a careful diet so not having sugar and limited alcohol etc etc. But previously it was the insomnia that led to drinking and the next day I caved on the coffee so this time I gotta make it through.

Thanks for any thoughts!

The pay is rather good. It's a 20mins drive from home so I can go restore my batteries at lunch. I can work from home 2/3 days a week. 

When I took the job, I was going through a tough depression. I'm still in it, but I've learned to cope as well as possible. I was followed by a psychiatrist who wanted to write me a note to only work from home but I refused as I was afraid they wouldn't keep me if I did.

I am very sensitive to noise. I work with my nose cancelling earphones all the time except in meetings. Sometimes, I'll have nose cancelling headphones on top. I had to explain that have to have my computer during meetings. If I don't, my mind starts wandering and going through my life, to the events that led me there and I spend all my energy trying not to cry and trying to look and act normal. We have a lot of meetings every week.

Today, we had a day of workshops. A whole day. No computers. No headphones. We started with an ice breaker where we had to answer questions by walking across the room to were the answer was written. For some reason, I'd rather not have to use my body at work. I feel like a fish on land. Out of place and gasping for air. Then we had the first workshop. 3 groups in a room. Around a table with chairs but no one dared to sit. Brainstorming. How am I supposed to brainstorm in the middle of a hurricane? 

We could barely hear each other over the voices of the other groups, the sound of the coffee machine, the hum of some hidden machines and footsteps. I went to the toilets to try and calm myself. But When I came back, my eyes had started leaking. I barely lasted 15 minutes before I walked to my boss to tell her I had to leave. I meant to say I needed a break and instead I heard myself say I was going home. 

Now I'm in bed. I don't think there's any point in trying to go back this afternoon. I can't just quit before I find something else but I'm afraid, after today, the decision is no longer in my hands.",21,1730372555.0,aspergirls,2,0.96,False

On the other hand, with medium roast South American blend (fruity and almonds) from the same shop, I have to got down to 3 to get the described notes. With 4 and above it just tastes like bland coffee. With another medium roast, at 4 it tastes ok, but at 3 I feel like it tastes much better, the flavours are more intense.

yet they persist in asking me out and sometimes buy  me  flowers and chocolates. How can I navigate this situation?

/rj

you get your third sugar daddy dm. an endless horde of bots that seem to not actually want anything from you other than to harvest data piles up your inbox. you sigh and go to delete the app, but figure there's no harm in a last hail mary. the woman you saw. the one with the kitschy style and the artsy hobbies. the one who likes things slow, is a little introverted and wasn't just searching for a hookup. the true urbanite. you wish you were as cool as she was. you can't stop thinking about her, ever since you saw her profile pop up in the people who liked your post. obviously, you just want to make a friend, get something out of this hell forsaken app - you're not attracted to women, obviously. *obviously.*

you ask about her taste in music, as her profile suggests. it's good, really good - the kind of genre you hadn't really considered before. you compliment it, she takes a look at your bio. against all odds, she thinks you have a lot in common. you're 'her type of person', purely as friends, of course. she describes you as a 'cute bookworm', saying that she loves it as a trait of yours. a neuro-string in your brain is stretched to breaking point. it snaps. probably nothing, you just really like her as a potential friend. you can't stop thinking about this person you just want to be *friends* with.

you get to talking about art. you don't know much in specific, but you have some niche knowledge and have visited a few cool exhibits. you start talking about tastes. hers match yours exactly, she just knows MORE. she's a veritable treasure trove of art history. you can't stop thinking about her. she recommends you a bauhaus ballet. it's one of the most incredible performances you've ever seen. you still can't stop thinking about her.

you get to talking about other hobbies. she enjoys her coffee. you haven't had one in years - the adhd which seems to plague your kind so much makes caffeine a sleeping potion. all her talk about coffee has made you want one again. she offers to make you one, the one she likes. with a winky face. snap.

before you know it, the picture of the woman you're messaging transforms. gone is the prospective friend and gone is your shield of 'oh, i'm not attracted to women'. you're not. you're attracted to woman. without your knowledge, every little thing you've been learning about her has been working to terraform your brain so that she can colonise it. unknowingly, you've been doing the same to her. you're trying to ignore it, keep it down. it's a scary and confusing new feeling and you just want a friend, don't you?

you talk about study. she's studying a field you've had a lifelong fascination with. you're studying a field she finds so inspirational. you can't stop yourself from typing, there's a message that's been living in your head for hours now and it's finally wormed its way to the surface. as much as you don't want to, you cannot stop yourself from telling her that you think she's beautiful inside and out. that it's been a privilege to know even what little you now do about her.

she responds. it's the kindest, most beautiful thing anyone has ever said about her. the fact that someone perceives her as intelligent, beautiful, even COOL is something she's never been told before and she's very open about it. it makes her feel incredible. she hits back with a barrage of similar feelings about you, describing you as a 'beautiful world'. it's something you've never felt before, either. you both decide to abandon the app and move to something less shit.

the first message you receive outside of it is 'i'm so excited'. you are too. you have no clue what's happening, these new feelings are terrifying, but you're all in. the warm liquefaction of your entire insides is too pleasant to ever dream of giving up. you both need to go to bed. it's insanely late and you're both exhausted. you drift off, dreaming about what this all means.

morning hits. you excitedly get to your phone and type up a message you've had in your head since last night. she makes you feel like a candle. she's the flame to your wick and talking to her just melts you. she writes back a few hours later when she wakes up. a snippet of a song, a melody that is the only thing she can even come close to describing her feelings with. talking to you makes her feel like she's in a cabin lit by candelight, one that smells sweetly of bergamot and cinnamon. it is the sweetest, most tender thing you've ever heard in your life. not even the fiction you bury yourself in ever has anything close to this. she heads off to class and you're left to dwell in your newfound euphoria.

is this really it? the first attempt at a serious relationship and you connect on such a deep level? every time you even THINK of her you just completely come apart at the seams. you're going to meet in person and soon and all the things you want to say and do with her come to mind. you tell a few friends about her. they don't know a certain thing about you, but they express jealousy. the word 'sapphic' comes around a few times. a few 'so gay, so sweet's. hours pass.

you leave the house for a bit to go and do something. a thought crosses your mind. ""i am transgender.""

it's becoming hard to breathe. it feels like the walls are closing in. you're out in the middle of public and fighting off a panic attack. the creeping realisation has set in. all the photos do not reveal what you actually are. you're deformed. deeply. and you're going to lose the person you've felt such an indescribably deep connection with over it. you finally experience what you would actually describe as love and an affliction forced on you from birth is ripping it away from you

you head home, pushing it down. we have such a connection, how could it happen? our personalities are perfect matches for each other, that's got to count. all perfectly rational thoughts. unfortunately, you're not listening to your brain right now. you sob until you vomit. you haven't even mentioned it yet and you've already rescinded to losing the person who has occupied your every waking (and sleeping) thought for the past two days. you spend the day in misery.

night comes. she's back from study. she wants to propose a date, but she cannot. she is so nervous. she asks to play pictionary to figure it out. you suggest sitting in a park with each other and just existing as the sun goes down, forgetting about your affliction for just a moment. she disappears. she comes back 15 minutes later, having had to 'calm down'. it's so adorable. you still can't stop thinking about her. she says she wanted to ask if you wanted to sit in the park and read poetry to each other. you are so in tune with one another it hurts. you do, you do, every single part of you does, but you need to rip this band-aid off.

it's an experience reminiscent of coming out to your parents. the agonising knowledge that you have to do it. the pressure and the release. she tells you good job. she can tell it's stressful. it comes as a shock to her. she had no clue. worst of all, she says she needs time to think about it. she calls your soul beautiful, but she needs time to think on *it*. you have no clue what *it* is. she asks you to analyse an artist she likes while she cooks dinner. you do it just to keep yourself from totally breaking down

you cry yourself to sleep. you've lost your connection with the most beautiful person who has ever existed throughout history, all because of something forced upon you, something you never wanted anything to do with. you should be mad at her, at the cis person detesting the weak poor tranny she formerly confessed her love for. she could never love someone with a 'M' formerly on her birth certificate.

you wake up in the middle of the night, exhausted. you check your phone. she loves your analysis. a local gallery has one of the pieces. she suggests that maybe you could get a closer look. together. there's that winky face again.

it's a minor glimmer of hope. you write a bunch of shit talking about how you can't stop thinking about the wonderful things she said to you and how you want to make a day of it where you do sit in the park and also go to the gallery. you go back to sleep.

you wake up. no response. she usually doesn't respond until night anyway. you need to head into the city today. you've always loved this little card shop there - buying people nice cards and writing heartfelt messages in them is one of your favourite things. you get the insane idea to buy her one.

you await your train. you think a little more on it. you've lost her. the deformity you'll never truly get rid of has torn away the only person you've ever truly loved. you can barely hold yourself together at the platform.

you get to the card shop. you're barely together. you spend half an hour searching for the perfect card. a painting from the 20s of a back alley in paris covered in flowers finally speaks to you - more than monet, anyway (too passe). you make it to your prior engagement, extremely late, but everyone else was extremely late too, so it doesn't matter. you leave.

you board the train to go home. you've lost her again. someone who truly had that connection with you wouldn't care, wouldn't need to think on *it*. it didn't matter how beautiful or tender the mutual feelings were before. you've got the tranny stink now. you know what you have to do. 

you feel no animosity, but you regret buying that card. you wanted to cross stitch her an image of a bouquet (easier to carry around than a real one and won't wilt), but you know you never will now. you love her. she loves you. but you'll never be together. your kind and hers do not mix. all the beautiful things she said instantly draw you to tears. you begin drafting a goodbye post to her, describing how much the past few days and feelings shared meant to you. how much you lament that you'll never be able to truly get to know her. how it pains you that card will go unwritten. you'll never read poetry to each other. there is no animosity, only crushed disappointment. you know it hurts her as much as it hurts you. bergamot and cinnamon keep repeating in your mind, like the tolls of a funeral bell. it's dramatic, it's cliche, but will you ever find love again? you know it's dramatic. but a connection like THAT seems damn near impossible to follow up, especially in the way it had to end.

a message pops up mid breakdown. you haven't sent anything yet. she's back from her study and exhausted. she wastes no time describing how much better seeing your messages has made her feel and describes the way you, personally, make her feel. like a pancake covered in syrup, she says. is it too late to ask you if you're busy on sunday, she says. she loves the idea of making a day of it. you haven't lost anything. this beautfiul woman absolutely adores you as much as you do her - she truly just needed time to comprehend. there was no malice, only love and understanding. the only person who could possibly hurt you was yourself. your own tranny brain, just doing its natural duty - urging you ever closer to the 41%, of course.

1ggb9rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ggb9rj/update_3_reminiscing_and_i_now_know_when_and_how/,Update 3 – Reminiscing and I now know when and how,"I’ve always enjoyed the walk from my mom’s place to my office.  The city always feels so alive in the morning.  Noise, people, activity everywhere.  There’s a really cute coffee shop on the corner along the way that I always stop at.  The barista is always so friendly and quick.  It’s such a contrast to the calming hum of the mountains that I can’t help but get excited.  I needed that this morning because I was running on only three hours of sleep.

I found myself thinking about Ian and our relationship.  We met at a dance club not to far from where I was walking.  I’d been out of a previous relationship for about 6 months when a group of coworkers decided to go out on the town on a Friday night.  I and a couple other ladies were dancing away when I noticed this guy that looked like Hayden Christensen just staring at me.  I kept glancing over and it was clear that he wasn’t taking his eyes off of me.  NGL, it turned me on.  He stopped me as I was leaving the dance floor, but it was far too loud to hear each other.  We tried to chat in a back corner, but it didn’t take long before we decided to leave and find a quiet diner where we could eat and chat.

He had some hilarious stories from his escapades that gave me belly laughs.  We really started connecting when he started describing his difficulties in running the shop though.  Back then I was so full of new professional energy that I couldn’t keep myself from talking about how to properly account for and manage his business.  He listened attentively to every word; I think he even pretended to take notes.  It made me feel special.

I’m not into ONS’s.  Seizure meds and alcohol don’t ever mix so I don’t drink and, therefore, have never had that boost of inhibition.  I’ve always been cautious about relationships, but I was pretty hooked by this guy from the start.  He walked me to my mom’s building; we shared our contact information and had an impressive make out session before I went up to bed and he went on his way.

He called me the next morning and asked if I’d join him for breakfast.  We continued our conversations like there was no pause at all.  He talked me into driving out to his shop and then we went on a mountain hike to a lake where we had a little picnic in a place that you would have thought no-one had been before.  I drove home that evening feeling the warmth of love. 

We were an official couple two weeks later.  I started spending weekends at his place after a month.  I moved in with him when we got engaged after about a year.  We got married in a small ceremony on Labor Day last year.  During the whole time we’ve been together I’ve been an integral part of the business.

The shop, as a business, was a disaster when I first started dating Ian.  I haven’t mentioned it before, but Ian’s mom passed away from cancer right around the time when Leah moved out.  Ian’s dad kind of fell apart from that point on and the shop suffered.  Ian was 25 when he and his brother inherited it.  They had pretty much taken over all the work part in the previous couple of years, so that wasn’t a problem, it was the business part that they had no clue how to handle.  I don’t think the shop would have lasted another 6 months if I hadn’t shown up to help.

It's always been a cash business.  A customer drops off their toy and they don’t get to pick it back up unless they pay cash for the parts and services.  The problem was that their dad had stopped worrying about getting work orders properly filled out.  He was just billing customers by memory by the time just before he passed.  It created a mess for the brothers to deal with.  Our first major change was ensuring that every job was properly tracked.  The boys started writing down the parts that were used and the time it took to fix a unit.  We also tacked on a little surcharge for the oil, nuts and polish that would always accompany any job.  That became their first step of returning the shop to being a business.

We also worked on getting them some proper banking arrangements.  An operating line of credit that was supported by their land and building gave us some real time to make meaningful changes to the business operations.  The bank did require an audit though.  We found a local firm willing to do the audit at a very reasonable rate because of my credentials as the controller of the business (I was so proud when we made that deal).

As many of you have probably thought, the boys starting to charge the “real” amount for their work rather than their dad’s guesstimate, did start to concern customers.  They had a pretty long period of some pretty sweet deals and were starting to blame the boys for taking advantage of them.  It wasn’t the case, but customer perception is their reality.

The Coup de Grace as they say, was when we changed our parts supplier.  The family had been using a wholesaler in the city for all their parts.  They would look at a machine, figure out the parts needed, then see if the wholesaler had them.  The price for the parts wasn’t horrible but the shipping was killing them.  They’d either have the parts sent by Purolator or UPS and pay the fee or one of the brothers would drive to and from the city.  Ian was on one of those runs when we met.  He was late getting to the warehouse and needed to stay overnight to pick up the parts.

The shop’s markup was 10% on parts, basically they would charge $110 for a part that cost them $100.  This is somewhat standard to their industry because they make their money on service.  The problem was that their costs to get the parts to the shop was not only destroying that 10% markup but also cutting into their service profit.  Add the fact that dad was forgetting parts in their billing and the business was doomed to fail.

I’ve mentioned that we are considered to be the best shop in our area.  We didn’t realize how significant our volume of parts orders was until we started to talk directly with manufacturers. 

It’s in the volume of orders and the grouping of them that save you money.  I was able to create listing of parts that are used every season, no matter how the season goes (barring disaster of course).  We then had the information of how we could order in bulk (basically fill a shipping container) and significantly reduce shipping costs.

After that we contracted the manufacturer directly to fill these orders.  At the end of the day, with volume discounts, it saved us about 35% on parts costs.  We transferred 20% of those savings to our customers and that is what ended their concerns about the boys’ possibly price gauging.  I don’t think that the shop has had a bad month since we made that happen.  It was a lot of work though.  Kerri actually helped during the process because she had some import connections.  She and I clicked, and our friendship/client relationship started.  I remember that Ian had to spend two weeks in Mexico to get the deals signed.

I say all of this because I find myself thinking of potential divorce.  I’ve been useless all morning and I’m writing this during my lunch break.  No, I’m not just thinking about money.  I’m a kick ass professional and I’ll be fine regardless of what happens.  I’m hurt though and I’m thinking about how I can make him pay.  I believe that the above affirms that I’ve been a big part of the shop’s success and, even though I’m not an owner, I feel that I’m due for some respect for how I’ve helped.

I’m feeling this way because I’ve realized how the two lovebirds have been executing their shenanigans.  It makes me sick to think about it TBH.  They pretty much organized their monthly rendezvous right under my eyes. 

I’ve said that we would do these monthly mountain adventures where we would take our dirt bikes or snowmobiles up to remote mountain locations.  It was originally Ian’s idea to create connections with customers and encourage the use of the vehicles we fixed.  I thought it was a great idea.  What I didn’t say was that Leah and Ian would always set the destination, and it was usually unattainable for us “Non-Experts”.  They would always charge ahead leaving me in a quasi no-mans land between them and the newbs.  The start was always slow, and they made sure that we knew proper safety and vehicle care.  Inevitably they’d get bored though and charge ahead to the destination.  That left me to putter along with the lower crew and make sure everyone was having fun.

They’d generally be apart from us for an hour or two, but they always returned to help the group set up lunch.  The decision would be made to then go further up or start returning.  They were always present and helpful during descent as that is the most dangerous part.

They clearly had the time to go have their fun.  It makes so much more sense when I think of this past Saturday.  The little gorge that caught Leah wasn’t so dangerous that falling in would cause major injury.  It was just, well, delaying, and would get you stuck if you didn’t have help getting out.  I was behind her, and I couldn’t figure out why she was taking the line so close to it.  There were plenty of safer lines than the one she chose.  Ian was over a ridge, so he didn’t see what happened.  She tried to power through the line, but didn’t make it and the back end of her bike fell down and dragged her in.

I now understand that she meant me to be the one to fall in while she zipped over the ridge.  She could have then had her fun with Ian, and they would eventually “save” me on their return.  It’s clear that her failure and my ability to help her out just triggered the guilty response she had.

I tried to call her a few times this morning and even sent her a: ***Please Respond to Me!*** text.  I ended up calling Rob (her man).  He’s an event coordinator at the resort she works at, so he almost always answers his phone.  He said that Leah had a planned vacation this week and even he couldn’t contact her.  She’ll be back this Sunday.  My only thought, and yeah, I’m a witch, is that she’s aborting her affair baby right now.

I’m heading home after work today and I plan on confronting my coward of a husband.  I’ll give everyone an update after it happens.

As always, thanks for your advice and support.",0,1730370542.0,stories,2,0.5,False

I will be traveling to London for the first time in November and will be spending 4 days in the city. I've pretty much finished my itinerary but wanna make sure I've spaced everything out enough. I will be traveling solo so can be pretty ""go-go-go"" when I need to! The only caveat is that I'll be buying a ticket for the HoHo bus (BOGO 24hrs) and want to use that to get around Days 2-4 instead of taking the tube. I'll be staying in a hostel near the tower of London.

**Sunday:**

\- flight lands at 10am, take the tube to grab english breakfast at either peter's cafe, dulce coffee, or grounded (any suggestions welcome!) 

\- check into hostel at 2pm 

\- tower of London for a couple hours

\- walk around tower bridge

\- dinner- hoping to get sunday roast at either hawksmoor or blacklock before they close

**Monday:**

\- Buckingham palace (changing of guards at 11)

\- lunch at mayfair chippy and explore Hyde Park 

\- British museum from 3-5

\- explore covent garden and grab dinner at dishoom

**Tuesday:** (I've left a lot of space this day in the hopes that I'll meet people at my hostel who will wanna hang out in the city)

\- lunch at borough market

\- jack the ripper walking tour 3:30-5?

\- dinner tbd

**Wednesday:**

\- river cruise at 10am

\- queens walk sightseeing (Westminster abbey -> palace of Westminster/big ben -> Westminster bridge -> london eye -> leake street -> southbank winter market -> st. paul's cathedral- I'm not super keen on going into any of the attractions unless you really recommend it!)

\- afternoon tea at the swan around 2:30/3pm

\- dinner at xian biang biang noodles

I hope I can check out the nightlife a couple times but since I'm a solo female on my first international trip I'm erring on the side of caution, so it'll be left up to whether I can find a good group at my hostel to go out with!

Thanks for reading through this! I am open to any and all feedback :) ",0,1730370402.0,uktravel,23,0.5,False

This obviously isn't specifically about coffee, it could be in any situation, and obviously not all Arabs are going to think the same, but is it rude if I, a mostly Ashkenazi Jew, say shukran instead of תודה?
Does it make me look cringe and like I'm trying too hard to get approval?


I worked in an Aroma in an area with a lot of Arabs, and sometimes the arab costumers would say shukran after paying, is it rude if I do it as well?

1ggb71j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ggb71j/i_27f_need_confirmation_that_hes_29m_been/,I (27F) need confirmation that he’s (29M) been unfaithful,"It’s Sunday morning and my husband has just left to go help his brother fix a bike, but I’m left wondering what he does anymore.  There was nothing unusual in how he acted this morning.  He let me sleep in a bit while he made breakfast.  I couldn’t bring myself to walk down to the kitchen in my usual tee shirt and panties.  I put a full cotton pajama set on because I’m struggling with what to think.  He noticed that I was aloof and stand offish right away.  I usually thank him with a hug and kiss but couldn’t bring myself to touch him or even look at him for that matter.  He asked me if I was okay and all I could muster is, “I’m fine, just feeling a bit icky.”.  I couldn’t eat and the coffee quickly turned my gut upside down.  I apologized to him for not staying but said that I needed to rest and went to our bathroom.  I stayed there until he had to leave, he yelled, “Goodbye, get better!”, through the door before he left.

It all started yesterday when we went dirt biking in the mountains.  We like to get out at least once a month and it’s getting late in the fall now.  Pretty soon we’ll be switching over to snowmobiles.  We had a group of 6.  My husband Ian, his longtime friend Leah (30F), her man Rob (32M), my friend and client Kerri (27F) and her husband Will (27M).  Ian and Leah would be considered expert riders.  They both grew up near the mountains and have biked, hiked, ran, skied and snowmobiled them all their lives.  I’ve been riding for the past three years since I started dating Ian.  We’ve been married just over a year now.  Rob, Kerri and Will have all just started this past summer.  All three of them are athletic and brave enough to enjoy riding but I do find myself split between the two groups often.

Yesterday I’d decided to keep up with the thrill seekers and leave the newbs behind.  I was so proud of myself when I did it.  I’ve learned to control my bike.  When to hit the gas and when to lay off.  How to recognize a good line to take versus a dangerous one.  How to avoid shale and stand or lean when necessary.  I truly held my own and both Ian and Leah were very impressed.  I even was able to help Leah get dusted off and back up out of a rock gorge that she failed to avoid.  I could see the surprise in her eyes when I pulled her up.  I don’t think she ever realized how strong I am.

I was a swimmer in college.  I even tried out for our country’s Olympic team and finished sixth.  Just a bit outside of being asked to continue training with them as an alternate.  I’ve always been very fit and I take pride in how strong I am for my size.

I’m all woman though.  All of my gear and my bike are pink.  I bought them when we started, and I’ve always loved my choice.  Leah didn’t though.  She would always tease me about being too girly for the mountains and would get downright mad if my bike had issues.  Calling it a “Pink piece of shit.”.  It wasn’t yesterday though; I held my own and she knew it.

We always gather at someone’s house when we’re done the day and after we drop our equipment off.  Last night we were at Leah and Rob’s.  They have a small house but a big firepit in their backyard.  It’s probably the last night of the year for that as well.  We did our usual talk about the day, sharing war stories and showing off bruises.  Will had a good fall that will leave quite the bruise on his hip.  I got to brag about pulling Leah up and helping her get her bike out of the gorge.  Leah got pretty messed up and was trying to brag about climbs she had done in the past that I couldn’t do at the time.  No-one gave her much airtime though.  She was starting to get emotional the more inebriated she got, sitting in her lawn chair, staring at me and crying a bit.  It was weird behavior for her.  We shut it down around midnight and Rob had to guide Leah into the house because she was struggling to keep her balance.

I say all of the above to give what I view as the context for the text Leah sent at 3am that I read this morning.  It said:

***I’m so sorry what we’ve been doing Amanda, I hope someday you can forgive me.***

I think it’s obvious how I’m interpreting this text but there is a small hope that it could be just referring to her disdain of my riding ability up to now.

I’m looking for some thoughts on how to proceed and I’ll answer questions in an update.

The iPhone 13 has better color reproduction, practically as the eyes see. I don't know if it's an issue with Android 15 or if AI just can't handle it xd
The sample photos with coffee aren't a disaster yet, but the ones from the Pixel are terribly distorted.

I switched from iOS after 9 years and now I kinda regret it. I still have few days to consider returning Pixel and get iPhone 16 Pro Max. Idk what to do 🐢
