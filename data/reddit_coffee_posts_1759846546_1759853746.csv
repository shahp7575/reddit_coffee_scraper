I am a nerdy, tall, fit, and hopefully charming teacher looking to connect and find romance through characters that I hope we can build together. 

My prompt idea is this: we had been friends for years; almost having a second language just the two of us could understand. Yet nothing ever happened. It was just that; friendship. You had been dating someone as long as I’d known you so in my mind you were always not that way. We would have coffee dates, study sessions, dance under the stars; and yet no kiss, no cuddles, just friendship. Eventually I moved on and found someone as well. We both ended up with others and yet remained close. It made sense as we had countless memories, inside jokes, and a set of memes meant just for us. Slowly though things changed. Our relationships weren’t what we thought they would be. Neither were our people. Yet you still rattled around in my head and remained in my life. The one that was always there; the one that got me. 

So how do things change? I would love you to build that with me. How do we slowly escalate as a romance builds long term where just a friendship once was. 

I look for putting part of ourselves in characters. I enjoy building a connection and relationship long term. I would like to slowly build romance over time.

So if that sounds like you I would love to find a long term partner to build this with. We can change this to be childhood friends from the same hometown, college friends that met in relationships, or high school best friends.

Message me if you’re interested along with something that you have been geeking out about lately. ",1,1759853386.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
1o0j1j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o0j1j3/dont_go_in_the_basement/,Don’t go in the basement,"It was moving day and all of our bags were packed. My alarm was set for 7 am as it always was because I was always an early riser. I could smell my mother cooking in the kitchen and the smell of freshly brewed coffee. My dad was reading the news paper in his spot at the table, good morning trinity, he said.  My little 12 year old sister was happily waiting for her breakfast. “Pancakes?” My mother asked cheerfully as she started setting the table starting with my father’s plate. I knew that soon after breakfast that we would have to start packing the car so we could head on the two hour journey to our new house, new state, new town, new, well, everything. I sat down at the table where my plate was and joined my family for breakfast. 
“Why do we have to move? I love it here!” My sister cried. 
“Well your father’s job offered him another position out of state with higher pay, he couldn’t turn it down Susan.” My said trying to calm my sister down “but it’s not fair! All my friends are here!” “And you have the opportunity to make new friends, and maybe your friends can come down to visit.” Dad chimed in. 
The news was on and there was word that they were looking for a man who had been on the run and possibly going through our new town, hopefully they would catch him soon.

After breakfast we all loaded up in the car and Susan turned on her earphones to listen to her favorite artist, one she knew I couldn’t stand, she started snapping her fingers to the beat. I knew it was going to be a long car ride. 
“Trinity, what about that boy you were telling us about?” Oh it’s defininity going to be a long car ride. “I don’t want to talk about him.” I sighed. The drive was long and the roads curvy we passed so many trees. It was 9 am by the time we got there. And the drive felt like it took forever. 

The house was beautiful, big enough for the four of us and a big yard with a fence. “Can we get a dog?!” My sister asked excitedly my sister had always loved animals. We walked inside and met the realtor. This is it! We ran upstairs. “Race you to the top!” My sister chimed 
My parents just laughed kids will be kids. Whatever you do, don’t go in the basement. The realtor said. Which we kind of thought was weird but we shrugged it off. We didn’t know why she would say such a thing! We got the keys to the home and started unpacking 
The first night there was a little off, I couldn’t sleep. So I went downstairs to get some water, when I did I heard a scratching sound coming from the basement. 

I ran upstairs without my glass of water and woke my parents up, I’ll call the agency in the morning, my father said. And went back to sleep. He forgot about the whole ordeal and didn’t make a big deal about it just called agency and left them a message and all they said was “don’t go in the basement.” 

Every night I kept waking up and coming down stairs to see if I could hear the scratching sound and I did, and every night it would get louder, until one night it turned into pounding. And then screaming. I was  watching the news late one  evening when my parents weren’t home and my sister was off at a friends house and saw the man who was on the run was never caught and he could be armed and dangerous. If anyone had any information they were to call the police immediately. H-h-help! I heard a call from the basement.
S-s-set me f-f-free I opened the door to the basement slowly. A man with a knife ran straight towards me

I screamed I didn’t have time to do anything else. I blacked out. There was blood, lots of it, my parents were at the hospital with me when I woke up, he had only cut my arm. Turned out my parents had placed security cameras around the house neither me nor my sister had known about. The person had been caught, it was the guy from the news and the realtor had known he was there the whole time. She was hiding him. ",1,1759853298.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1o0j0u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o0j0u3/towing_exs_car_too_far/,Towing ex’s car too far?,"EX gf and I had a blowout fight on 8/30, did not talk for two weeks and then met up to call it off for good. that week, I left a note on her door saying that i wanted to try to make things work btw us and that id rather fight for her than start over with someone new. she didn't reply until the weekend but we did end up meeting up to get drinks. it was more or less like old times and we had a fun outing. we hung in the morning too and then i said goodbye.

Leading up to this we'd been fighting more often and i was her first real bf so i think she was a little less emotionally mature than i. But we still had more good times than bad, and I thought we were both still in love. when we were together, she was not smoking weed at all, somewhat of my request because i was very up front before we headed into the relationship 1.5yrs ago that i wouldn't date a smoker just out of personal pref (i don't smoke). when we met up post-breakup, she was high and ripping a pen while we were together. the whole week after the meet up, we continued texting -- it was a little off but we did joke around like usual. i had assumed that she did not want to face the music of the fact that us getting back together would likely require a lifestyle change (smoking) that she wasn't ready for and i was trying to respect that. but being in limbo was too difficult for me and after she cancelled our plans to meet up again, i essentially asked if this has run its course (short answer is yes it had).

her reply was something along the lines of ohhh i had only met up with her again for sex (despite my very heartfelt note). I told her if she isn't going to choose me i can't continue to choose her bc it was bad for my mental health.
the next morning i had seen that she'd updated her hinge. I was on the app as well obviously, but i hadn't unpaused my account and was just downloading to see if she was on. she was not the type to hop back onto hinge like that from my experience with her (very unpromiscuous girl, inexperienced dater). that was a dagger for me to see and i blocked her on everything and deleted her number. 

from when we met up though, i do know that she still has a lot of these gifts that i had given her in her apartment (ie; custom coffee mug, personalized space heater, hoodies, etc) that she loved - but id have imagined that they'd remind her a little too much of me... either way, she's still got them and using every day i'd presume. AND she keeps parking at my house. she lives 7 miles away but is very anal about the area she lives / if her car would get broken into so she's literaly left her car RIGHT in front of my house and uberred home to her apt. So, in my head im like -- how the hell could you be going on dates and meeting a new guy and then have to be like yeah let me go get my car from my ex's house..?? seems insanely weird, but again - she was very paranoid about the crime.

i'm trying not to read into the car being out front but since i'm far from over her, it's making me think oohh i could run into her again, that she might've done this intentionally, that we're not over for good. simultaneously, i don't want to text her - after the note, im trying to be good about no contact lol. i don't want to break that, nor do i want to give her the satisfaction of knowing that the damned car is bothering me so much. its now been 2+ weeks since shes been to or moved the car from its current spot, and 40 days since our initial break up. my options are as follows:

• leave the car where it is, try to get past the fact that its there and move on. 
• try to get it ticketed (its technically without a permit - but not sure how i'd be able to make this happen)
• call non-emergency services and get them to tow it since its been parked illegally for a month now 
• text her and say hey i need u to move this its causing issues for me 

obviously towing is the easiest/quickest solution but i'm also sitting here thinking this is the last connection i have to her and i dont want to let it go / don't want to piss her off if she actually by some chance was thinking about reaching out, etc.

1o0izhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1o0izhz/the_people_in_my_grief_counseling_group_are/,The People in My Grief Counseling Group Are Coming to Kill Me,"If you haven’t read the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/s/QAsfdAVzCF) or [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/s/QAsfdAVzCF) part of this yet, I really recommend starting there.

Things have gotten worse — way worse — and none of this will make sense unless you start from the beginning.

I didn’t want to go back to the grief group after what happened in my last post. 

I thought avoiding it would keep me safe.

I was emotionally exhausted and frightened. I had eventually confided in my parents about everything and told them that I needed space. 

I don’t think they believed me in the slightest but deep down, they knew something was genuinely troubling me. 

It was ironic that the place that was supposed to feel safest ended up feeling like a trap I’d willingly walked into.

I pulled away and for a brief bit, things seemed like they were returning to normal. 

But that’s when I kept seeing them — the other members — everywhere.

For example, I stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a couple of things last week, and that’s when I saw Mark. 

He was standing in front of the cereal aisle, staring at the same shelf like he’d forgotten what food was.

I was friendly enough and gave him a small wave, but he didn’t move or seem to register that I was there.

He just stood there with one hand outstretched toward a box of Frosted Flakes like he was stuck in a paused commercial.

It was like the lights were on, but nobody was home if you catch my drift.

Then I saw Lillian hanging out near the library. I didn’t say anything to her, but she was sitting on a bench with an orange popsicle melting in her hand. 

She kept repeating the same sentence:

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

It was like witnessing a computer malfunction in real time. 

I ignored it and went about my business; I didn’t want anything to do with the grief group after last time.

But that all changed when I saw Greg at the park where Eli and I used to hang out a couple days ago.

When I was walking past him, something was...wrong.

His eyes were glazed over, blinking too slowly as he tossed breadcrumbs to the birds.

Except… he wasn’t.

His hand moved in a slow, looping rhythm — but nothing left his fingers.

He was mimicking the motion.

And the birds? They weren’t eating.

They were just still —watching with heads tilted.

“Greg?” I called out, concerned at what I was seeing.

He turned, his movements stiff and his eyes flickering with irritation.

“Do I know you?” 

“Yeah, I’m Lucas. We go to counseling together.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tossed a couple more breadcrumbs to the birds near his feet.

“Sure you do, you lost your brother like I did. You said that your brother avoided spaghetti because the sauce smelled like pennies.” 

Greg shot me an angry glare and turned his back to me.

“I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave right now.” 

“I’m sorry.” I left in a hurry, not wanting to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.

Something was deeply wrong.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I would go back to get answers.

I wasn’t going to go during a session though; I was going to go after hours.

I told myself it was just to calm my nerves, to prove there was nothing strange about it.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I wasn’t going there to be reassured — I was going there to find what had scared me away.

If there were answers to what was happening to them — to me — they’d be hidden there, in that circle of chairs where all of this began.



I left my parents’ house at around 8 p.m. 

They were off at some trivia night for a fundraiser they were passionate about.  I think they hoped I’d join them but I wasn’t really interested.

I had more important matters to attend to tonight. I couldn’t.

The sun had just dropped below the horizon as I circled the community center on foot to kill time.

The streetlights were slowly flickering to life one by one, and the traffic of people’s daily commutes were becoming quieter.

I watched my phone screen as the time grew closer to 9 pm, signaling the close of the community center and tonight’s session.

I waited for the place to clear out, for everyone to come outside so that I could sneak in before the doors locked.

But nobody ever came out. 

I stood outside and watched the time on my phone go from 9:05 pm to 9:45 pm. 

By 9:52, no one had come out.

I could’ve gone home. I told myself that more than once. 

But the part of me that needed answers — that part of me didn’t care how scared I was. 

The worst thing I could do would be to find out I was right.

Nobody had walked out yet.

What gives? Why was nobody leaving?

I tried the front door, but it was locked.

I looked inside the windows and was greeted with darkness.

I couldn’t see anything so I lifted on the window to see if it would budge.

Thankfully, it was unlocked, and I managed to crawl inside.

The air inside was stale with a mixture of old coffee grounds, paper, and like something had been left to rot inside the walls.

With a series of coughs, I stepped onto the floor and let the window fall shut behind me with a soft click.

The main hallway was lit only by a flickering EXIT sign in the distance. 

I passed the front desk and noticed the guest sign-in sheet was still out. 

I didn’t mean to look, but there it was — my name.

It had been written repeatedly on every line, signed in my handwriting. 

The dates went back years, even before I was alive.

The bulletin board near the front desk was still cluttered with yoga fliers, potluck invitations, and missing pet notices — but they all appeared to have had all the color sucked out of them. 

There was a new flyer tacked to the bottom corner — torn at the edge like it had been ripped from a child’s notebook.

I paused to read what it said:

“Grief Group – Tuesday’s @ 7 PM – Bring your most cherished memory.”

Beneath it, in messy, childish handwriting:

“He dotted his i’s with bubble circles.”

I blinked and saw that the flyer had vanished completely.

Had I imagined it?

I didn’t let myself dwell on it as I kept moving forward through the dark.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A new text lit up the screen.: 

Mom: “Hope you're okay. Trivia just ended — we’re heading home soon. ❤️”

I stared at it longer than I meant to.

I could’ve gone with them, but instead, I was here pursuing something I didn’t fully understand.

I turned the phone’s light off and kept walking, not bothering to reply.

I strained my ears for any kind of sound — a creak, a whisper, a shuffle — but there was nothing, only silence.

I could only hear the sound of my own blood moving through my veins.

I crept farther down the hallway, my steps muffled by the old tile. 

The reeking stench of rot continued to grow stronger the closer I got to the counseling room.

I pressed my sleeve to my face, but it didn’t help. 

The scent was in the air, but also in the paint, the carpet, the wood…everything. 

It was like an infected wound left unbandaged.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the frame, the door was already partially cracked open.

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

""All in all is all we are...""

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

""All in all is all we are...""

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”

1o0ixgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1o0ixgg/the_people_in_my_grief_counseling_group_are/,The People in My Grief Counseling Group Are Coming to Kill Me,"If you haven’t read the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/s/44bf5LZKzm) or [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/s/44bf5LZKzm) part of this yet, I really recommend starting there.

Things have gotten worse — way worse — and none of this will make sense unless you start from the beginning.

I didn’t want to go back to the grief group after what happened in my last post. 

I thought avoiding it would keep me safe.

I was emotionally exhausted and frightened. I had eventually confided in my parents about everything and told them that I needed space. 

I don’t think they believed me in the slightest but deep down, they knew something was genuinely troubling me. 

It was ironic that the place that was supposed to feel safest ended up feeling like a trap I’d willingly walked into.

I pulled away and for a brief bit, things seemed like they were returning to normal. 

But that’s when I kept seeing them — the other members — everywhere.

For example, I stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a couple of things last week, and that’s when I saw Mark. 

He was standing in front of the cereal aisle, staring at the same shelf like he’d forgotten what food was.

I was friendly enough and gave him a small wave, but he didn’t move or seem to register that I was there.

He just stood there with one hand outstretched toward a box of Frosted Flakes like he was stuck in a paused commercial.

It was like the lights were on, but nobody was home if you catch my drift.

Then I saw Lillian hanging out near the library. I didn’t say anything to her, but she was sitting on a bench with an orange popsicle melting in her hand. 

She kept repeating the same sentence:

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

It was like witnessing a computer malfunction in real time. 

I ignored it and went about my business; I didn’t want anything to do with the grief group after last time.

But that all changed when I saw Greg at the park where Eli and I used to hang out a couple days ago.

When I was walking past him, something was...wrong.

His eyes were glazed over, blinking too slowly as he tossed breadcrumbs to the birds.

Except… he wasn’t.

His hand moved in a slow, looping rhythm — but nothing left his fingers.

He was mimicking the motion.

And the birds? They weren’t eating.

They were just still —watching with heads tilted.

“Greg?” I called out, concerned at what I was seeing.

He turned, his movements stiff and his eyes flickering with irritation.

“Do I know you?” 

“Yeah, I’m Lucas. We go to counseling together.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tossed a couple more breadcrumbs to the birds near his feet.

“Sure you do, you lost your brother like I did. You said that your brother avoided spaghetti because the sauce smelled like pennies.” 

Greg shot me an angry glare and turned his back to me.

“I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave right now.” 

“I’m sorry.” I left in a hurry, not wanting to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.

Something was deeply wrong.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I would go back to get answers.

I wasn’t going to go during a session though; I was going to go after hours.

I told myself it was just to calm my nerves, to prove there was nothing strange about it.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I wasn’t going there to be reassured — I was going there to find what had scared me away.

If there were answers to what was happening to them — to me — they’d be hidden there, in that circle of chairs where all of this began.



I left my parents’ house at around 8 p.m. 

They were off at some trivia night for a fundraiser they were passionate about.  I think they hoped I’d join them but I wasn’t really interested.

I had more important matters to attend to tonight. I couldn’t.

The sun had just dropped below the horizon as I circled the community center on foot to kill time.

The streetlights were slowly flickering to life one by one, and the traffic of people’s daily commutes were becoming quieter.

I watched my phone screen as the time grew closer to 9 pm, signaling the close of the community center and tonight’s session.

I waited for the place to clear out, for everyone to come outside so that I could sneak in before the doors locked.

But nobody ever came out. 

I stood outside and watched the time on my phone go from 9:05 pm to 9:45 pm. 

By 9:52, no one had come out.

I could’ve gone home. I told myself that more than once. 

But the part of me that needed answers — that part of me didn’t care how scared I was. 

The worst thing I could do would be to find out I was right.

Nobody had walked out yet.

What gives? Why was nobody leaving?

I tried the front door, but it was locked.

I looked inside the windows and was greeted with darkness.

I couldn’t see anything so I lifted on the window to see if it would budge.

Thankfully, it was unlocked, and I managed to crawl inside.

The air inside was stale with a mixture of old coffee grounds, paper, and like something had been left to rot inside the walls.

With a series of coughs, I stepped onto the floor and let the window fall shut behind me with a soft click.

The main hallway was lit only by a flickering EXIT sign in the distance. 

I passed the front desk and noticed the guest sign-in sheet was still out. 

I didn’t mean to look, but there it was — my name.

It had been written repeatedly on every line, signed in my handwriting. 

The dates went back years, even before I was alive.

The bulletin board near the front desk was still cluttered with yoga fliers, potluck invitations, and missing pet notices — but they all appeared to have had all the color sucked out of them. 

There was a new flyer tacked to the bottom corner — torn at the edge like it had been ripped from a child’s notebook.

I paused to read what it said:

“Grief Group – Tuesday’s @ 7 PM – Bring your most cherished memory.”

Beneath it, in messy, childish handwriting:

“He dotted his i’s with bubble circles.”

I blinked and saw that the flyer had vanished completely.

Had I imagined it?

I didn’t let myself dwell on it as I kept moving forward through the dark.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A new text lit up the screen.: 

Mom: “Hope you're okay. Trivia just ended — we’re heading home soon. ❤️”

I stared at it longer than I meant to.

I could’ve gone with them, but instead, I was here pursuing something I didn’t fully understand.

I turned the phone’s light off and kept walking, not bothering to reply.

I strained my ears for any kind of sound — a creak, a whisper, a shuffle — but there was nothing, only silence.

I could only hear the sound of my own blood moving through my veins.

I crept farther down the hallway, my steps muffled by the old tile. 

The reeking stench of rot continued to grow stronger the closer I got to the counseling room.

I pressed my sleeve to my face, but it didn’t help. 

The scent was in the air, but also in the paint, the carpet, the wood…everything. 

It was like an infected wound left unbandaged.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the frame, the door was already partially cracked open.

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

""All in all is all we are...""

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

""All in all is all we are...""

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

""All in all is all we are...""

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

""All in all is all we are...""

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”

1o0ivby,https://i.redd.it/4dfye0k2kptf1.jpeg,Coffee Spots of Nagpur 4: three beans,"Nagpur has too many coffee spots – I’m reviewing them one by one.  
This week’s stop: ***Three Beans***, Abhyankar Nagar

⸻

☕️ **Coffee I tried:**

* Espresso Tonic – 8/10 (Good, well balanced) 
* Aeropress Iced – 6.5/10 (Decent)

⸻

Here’s my take:  
After the disaster show last week at 222, this week's spot turned out to be beacon of hope for our taste buds. three beans turned out to be better than expected, staff was extremely friendly, helpful and great at fulfilling special requests. Service was fast enough and smooth, adding to the experience as a great positive. 

*“As long as there was coffee in the world, how bad could things be?”* – Cassandra Clare

Pricing was okay, \~200 per beverage, for the taste and the overall experience, it was worth every Rupee. This was the only cafe that provided us with palette cleansers along with the aeropress, tells us how much they value their coffees and the experience that follows it. There is a big room for improvement in terms of adding more unique beverages/flavours to the menu but if you are someone who likes their coffee black, I am somewhat sure this place won't disappoint. You can ask them to brew your drink strength either as light to medium or just a balanced medium roast. 

It felt like they follow the code, ""simple, but done right"" over there, reflected in the black brews they serve. They also suggested that we try out their civil lines outlet, which does offer a wider range of beans and an overall better selection of beverages. Overall, a step or couple up from 222, but it still can’t quite touch the taste we got at Lush House or Aromas. 

⸻

Anyone tried the Civil Lines branch yet? Curious how it compares.

  
***P.S.*** Aromas cafe (Post 2)  which we rated highly before is offering a great discount, bringing down the price of VB's Special Cold Brew to Rs 128. Highly recommended to try.

Things have gotten worse — way worse — and none of this will make sense unless you start from the beginning.

I didn’t want to go back to the grief group after what happened in my last post. 

I thought avoiding it would keep me safe.

I was emotionally exhausted and frightened. I had eventually confided in my parents about everything and told them that I needed space. 

I don’t think they believed me in the slightest but deep down, they knew something was genuinely troubling me. 

It was ironic that the place that was supposed to feel safest ended up feeling like a trap I’d willingly walked into.

I pulled away and for a brief bit, things seemed like they were returning to normal. 

But that’s when I kept seeing them — the other members — everywhere.

For example, I stopped off at the grocery store to pick up a couple of things last week, and that’s when I saw Mark. 

He was standing in front of the cereal aisle, staring at the same shelf like he’d forgotten what food was.

I was friendly enough and gave him a small wave, but he didn’t move or seem to register that I was there.

He just stood there with one hand outstretched toward a box of Frosted Flakes like he was stuck in a paused commercial.

It was like the lights were on, but nobody was home if you catch my drift.

Then I saw Lillian hanging out near the library. I didn’t say anything to her, but she was sitting on a bench with an orange popsicle melting in her hand. 

She kept repeating the same sentence:

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

It was like witnessing a computer malfunction in real time. 

I ignored it and went about my business; I didn’t want anything to do with the grief group after last time.

But that all changed when I saw Greg at the park where Eli and I used to hang out a couple days ago.

When I was walking past him, something was...wrong.

His eyes were glazed over, blinking too slowly as he tossed breadcrumbs to the birds.

Except… he wasn’t.

His hand moved in a slow, looping rhythm — but nothing left his fingers.

He was mimicking the motion.

And the birds? They weren’t eating.

They were just still —watching with heads tilted.

“Greg?” I called out, concerned at what I was seeing.

He turned, his movements stiff and his eyes flickering with irritation.

“Do I know you?” 

“Yeah, I’m Lucas. We go to counseling together.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He tossed a couple more breadcrumbs to the birds near his feet.

“Sure you do, you lost your brother like I did. You said that your brother avoided spaghetti because the sauce smelled like pennies.” 

Greg shot me an angry glare and turned his back to me.

“I don’t know who you are, but you need to leave right now.” 

“I’m sorry.” I left in a hurry, not wanting to make the situation any more uncomfortable than it already was.

Something was deeply wrong.

Against my better judgment, I decided that I would go back to get answers.

I wasn’t going to go during a session though; I was going to go after hours.

I told myself it was just to calm my nerves, to prove there was nothing strange about it.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I wasn’t going there to be reassured — I was going there to find what had scared me away.

If there were answers to what was happening to them — to me — they’d be hidden there, in that circle of chairs where all of this began.



I left my parents’ house at around 8 p.m. 

They were off at some trivia night for a fundraiser they were passionate about.  I think they hoped I’d join them but I wasn’t really interested.

I had more important matters to attend to tonight. I couldn’t.

The sun had just dropped below the horizon as I circled the community center on foot to kill time.

The streetlights were slowly flickering to life one by one, and the traffic of people’s daily commutes were becoming quieter.

I watched my phone screen as the time grew closer to 9 pm, signaling the close of the community center and tonight’s session.

I waited for the place to clear out, for everyone to come outside so that I could sneak in before the doors locked.

But nobody ever came out. 

I stood outside and watched the time on my phone go from 9:05 pm to 9:45 pm. 

By 9:52, no one had come out.

I could’ve gone home. I told myself that more than once. 

But the part of me that needed answers — that part of me didn’t care how scared I was. 

The worst thing I could do would be to find out I was right.

Nobody had walked out yet.

What gives? Why was nobody leaving?

I tried the front door, but it was locked.

I looked inside the windows and was greeted with darkness.

I couldn’t see anything so I lifted on the window to see if it would budge.

Thankfully, it was unlocked, and I managed to crawl inside.

The air inside was stale with a mixture of old coffee grounds, paper, and like something had been left to rot inside the walls.

With a series of coughs, I stepped onto the floor and let the window fall shut behind me with a soft click.

The main hallway was lit only by a flickering EXIT sign in the distance. 

I passed the front desk and noticed the guest sign-in sheet was still out. 

I didn’t mean to look, but there it was — my name.

It had been written repeatedly on every line, signed in my handwriting. 

The dates went back years, even before I was alive.

The bulletin board near the front desk was still cluttered with yoga fliers, potluck invitations, and missing pet notices — but they all appeared to have had all the color sucked out of them. 

There was a new flyer tacked to the bottom corner — torn at the edge like it had been ripped from a child’s notebook.

I paused to read what it said:

“Grief Group – Tuesday’s @ 7 PM – Bring your most cherished memory.”

Beneath it, in messy, childish handwriting:

“He dotted his i’s with bubble circles.”

I blinked and saw that the flyer had vanished completely.

Had I imagined it?

I didn’t let myself dwell on it as I kept moving forward through the dark.

My phone vibrated in my pocket. A new text lit up the screen.: 

Mom: “Hope you're okay. Trivia just ended — we’re heading home soon. ❤️”

I stared at it longer than I meant to.

I could’ve gone with them, but instead, I was here pursuing something I didn’t fully understand.

I turned the phone’s light off and kept walking, not bothering to reply.

I strained my ears for any kind of sound — a creak, a whisper, a shuffle — but there was nothing, only silence.

I could only hear the sound of my own blood moving through my veins.

I crept farther down the hallway, my steps muffled by the old tile. 

The reeking stench of rot continued to grow stronger the closer I got to the counseling room.

I pressed my sleeve to my face, but it didn’t help. 

The scent was in the air, but also in the paint, the carpet, the wood…everything. 

It was like an infected wound left unbandaged.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the frame, the door was already partially cracked open.

I pushed it open slowly…not sure what to expect on the other side.

I stifled a scream at the scene before me.

They were seated in a circle, the other members of the grief therapy group.

They were sitting silently in their chairs, completely motionless and seemingly unaware of my presence.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing.

There was no response. They didn’t even flinch when I stepped closer to them.

The eyes in their blank faces were open and fogged over, their limbs limp and slack.

They looked like puppets, staged for an audience that never came.

I backed up toward the window, my heartbeat hammering in my ears.

My breath hitched and I took a step back, but the silence around me thickened.

That’s when I heard her voice:

“Lucas.”

The voice slithered out from the far corner of the room as she slowly and deliberately emerged.

Jean.

Her green eyes glowed faintly in the dark, catching the flicker of the exit sign like an animal's. 

Her teeth smiled, but her skin didn’t follow.

“Who are they? What is this place?” The questions poured out of me as I met her gaze, determined to not let her see how scared I was.

She tilted her head, studying me like an insect under a microscope, her body looked half-sculpted out of shadow.

“They’re empty now,” she said, almost fondly. “Just… leftovers.”

She circled one of the group members — Jonah — and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. His head lolled slightly at her touch.

“Grief rots the soul in the most delicious ways. These?” She gestured at the others. “They were a buffet, nothing more than a tasting menu of sorrow. I’ve taken everything worth keeping.”

“You’re sick,” I spat.

She only smiled wider. “No, Lucas. I’m just very hungry.”

“What does that make you?” 

It was a question I most wanted to know despite dreading what I might hear.

Her eyes turned a darker shade as her features changed into something monstrous for a brief second.

“Are you sure you want to know?”

I swallowed the lump in my throat and looked at the group. Their heads remained still, but now I could hear a song playing in the distance.

Like a broken lullaby playing in an empty room, it echoed off-key and gradually grew louder.

“What else should I be... all apologies...”

I felt my blood turn ice-cold, not just because I recognized the song, but because it wasn’t coming from a speaker.

It was leaking out of Jonah’s now open, unhinged mouth.

He looked like a snake attempting to swallow its prey.

“Why do you know this song?” I asked, nervousness creeping into my voice.

Jean stepped closer, her features changing from human to monster and back to human in rapid succession.

Her pupils spread until they swallowed the green entirely and her skin thinned and tightened as if something beneath was pressing outward, desperate to crawl free. 

Her mouth stretched open widely, revealing a second row of teeth nested deep inside her throat, glistening like sunlight on glass. 

Behind them, I saw an eye blink.

It was Eli’s eye.

And it was watching me intently…

The air escaped my chest and my knees buckled…

Then it was gone, replaced by her human face again, as though nothing had happened.

“Because it’s yours, his, hers, and all of theirs.”

She pointed to each individual member in the circle as I stared at their lifeless bodies. 

 “What do you mean? None of this makes any sense. What do we and Eli have to do with you?”

Jean gave a small, pitying smile. “You mourn in a single thread, Lucas. But I walk the whole tapestry.”

She circled me like a shark that smelled blood in the water, methodical and precise.

“Do you really think you were the only one who had him? They all did — in places you’ll never see, in timelines you never touched. I’ve just consumed every drop of their pain until they became a husk of the person they were before. They only exist here, but everywhere else, they’re nothing.”

I felt all the color drain from my skin at the revelation.

“You’re lying.”

She didn’t flinch. “Grief is a powerful thing that tethers us to the most precious gift of all, memory. I show up where it pools and festers. I don’t create the pain — I just know how to find it.”

Her movements were unnatural, as though her body were lagging, catching up a fraction of a second too late.

Her fingers elongated, thinning into brittle shafts of yellow light and clicked against each other like insect mandibles.

I realized with dawning horror what they looked like.

Sun Sticks.

Eli’s Sun Sticks.

Except now they were splintered and curved at the ends like talons.

“I’ve worn many names and faces in the eons since my creation, but to feed on a pain as pure as yours Lucas... I had to be Jean.”

I wanted to cry, but not out of fear, but because seeing those beautiful, stupid little sticks we used to make had now twisted into weapons.

It felt as though Eli was being torn apart right in front of me.

“I need your grief to finish what I’ve started.”

Behind her, the others began to shift.

At first, just the slightest movements — a twitch of the hand, a slow turn of the head.

Then, they all began to murmur in soft, disjointed unison.

""All in all is all we are...""

The phrase repeated, growing louder and more distorted than the last, until the sound vibrated through the walls and crawled up my spine.

“It’s your turn to share.” Mark’s tone was flat and lacking any emotion. 

I watched them stand and approach me in small, jerky motions until they surrounded me in a loose circle.

“Eli’s gone,” Lillian whispered. “Share with us.”

“No, this isn’t real.” I closed my eyes, trying my hardest to convince myself that this was all just a nightmare.

Jean stepped towards me, her fingers twitched excitedly as they touched my cheek. 

“Don’t fight it. You’re the main course.”

She rubbed the tips together in a slow, circular motion — the same way Eli used to roll the Sun Sticks between his palms, warming them up before handing me one.

Seeing her mimic a ritual that was precious to me made something inside me snap.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!!!” I declared as I pulled away and ran towards the window.

I shoved past Shane and pulled the window open as I felt hands grip my ankle tightly. 

I could feel myself being pulled back in, but I thrashed around and kicked wildly until I was able to crawl through the window and fall to the ground outside.

As soon as my feet graced the sidewalk, I sprinted all the way home and locked the door behind me, gasping like I’d been drowning.

When I got home, the house was empty. 

I thought I’d beat them back from their trivia night at the fundraiser…but the car was in the driveway. 

All the lights were off, no note was left behind, and there was no indication that that they had been home at all.

After searching the house and not being able to locate them, I ran upstairs and immediately logged onto the computer. 

I’m typing this as fast as I can.

I need someone to know my story before I’m taken away entirely by something I can’t really comprehend.

Maybe this will be enough to warn someone, to avoid others from falling victim to…these monsters.

Wait…I hear something.

It sounded like the front door had opened.

I had locked it hadn’t I?

I called out and expected my mom or my dad to answer but nobody did.

I’m terrified right now.

I hear footsteps slowly walking up the stairs towards my room.

I hear inconsistent, strangled breathing from down the hallway — like someone trying to laugh and choke at the same time.

The footsteps have reached my door…they have stopped.

I don’t hear anything.

I can hear someone whispering as they jiggle the doorknob erratically. 

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

And then, through the crack beneath my door:

""All in all is all we are...""

I see Eli’s eye staring back at me from the reflection of my computer screen.

“It’s your turn to share, Rabbit.”

1)
It was a cd and there was always an intro of a white guy riding a bike in the city and he was wearing a white coat and he seemed late for smth and had to run up stairs to go babysit a young boy and girl (I think the girl was older?) and the parents were leaving all dressed up fancy like and then they’d close all the blinds and turn the lights off n sit on a white couch n put one of them long candles on a glass coffee table (I think?) and when they lit the candle it would turn into being animated n I remember a specific movie about a male ladybug who got washed away by a river I think n there was always this little cricket too

2)
This one’s unrelated I think but it was this family of a mum, dad and I think 3 daughters (?) moving into this purple mansion that was haunted because some guy got accused (I think falsely) of doing smth and he was locked in one of the mansion rooms and the room was sealed off w bricks (I vividly remember this scene and it lowkey scared me) and at one point one of the daughters goes outside and sees the ghost in one of the windows n there’s a dead tree I think, pretty sure this was set mid 1900s cuz there was one of them old carriage looking cars (might’ve been pulled by horses tho)

Im pretty sure these all came out early 2000s-2010s please help me find this I’ve been looking for like a week straight n no one else seems to remember these movies it’s driving me insane. 🙏🏽

1o0ily3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1o0ily3/explore_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_kidisle/,Explore Best Single Serve Coffee Maker KIDISLE Review Worth It,"**Unique Design and Compact Size**  
The first thing that caught my eye with the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL coffee maker was its sleek and compact design. Measuring just 8 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 10 inches high, it fit snugly on my already cluttered countertop without looking out of place. Its black finish gives it a modern yet understated appearance, blending into practically any kitchen aesthetic. For someone like me, who values functionality without sacrificing style, this coffee maker’s design immediately stood out. It’s perfect for small apartments, office desks, or even a dorm room. The lightweight frame, at just over 5.5 pounds, made it easy for my coworker to move and store when cleaning.  

**Brewing Versatility You Can Count On**  
I’m a sucker for options, and this coffee maker delivers. The 3-in-1 brewing function ensures that I can switch between using K-cup pods, brewing my favorite ground coffee, or even steeping tea. The inclusion of two specific adaptors and a reusable capsule adds to the convenience, reducing waste and giving me more flexibility. Whether I’m craving a quick espresso shot or longing for a calming chamomile tea, this machine covers all bases.  

[Check KIDISLE CM9429D - UL price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)  

**Good Points**  
- **Adaptability:** Works with K-cups, ground coffee, and tea, making it ideal for diverse tastes.  
- **Space-Saving Design:** Its slim and compact style means it fits almost anywhere.  
- **Self-Cleaning Functionality:** By holding the 'SIZE' and 'BREW' buttons, you activate an automatic cleaning function, which I typically run every other month. Trust me, it’s a lifesaver when it comes to maintenance.  

**Five Brew Sizes To Meet Any Need**  
One of my favorite features is the coffee maker’s ability to brew different cup sizes ranging from 6 to 14 ounces. Whether I’m in the mood for a short, strong shot to kickstart my day, or a larger, more leisurely cup, this machine handles it all. During a recent family brunch, my cousin appreciated being able to customize her coffee size to match her appetite. The removable drip tray also accommodates travel mugs up to 7.2 inches tall, which is a big deal for those of us always on the go.  

**Downsides**  
- **Cup Temperature Fluctuations:** While it brews efficiently, I noticed the temperature of the coffee sometimes varied slightly.  
- **Plastic Odor During Initial Use:** Right out of the box, there was a faint plastic smell, but running several water cycles resolved this.  

**Ease Of Maintenance Simplifies Life**  
Cleaning coffee machines can be a nightmare, but this one goes above and beyond to make it simple. The self-cleaning function has already saved me countless hours. Unlike some machines I’ve tried before, I didn’t have to go digging into nooks and crannies with a brush. Regular use of this feature ensures the machine avoids any clogging, which inevitably extends its lifespan. My colleague who borrowed it for a week appreciated not having to deal with the hassle of a manual clean-out.  

**Other Options Worth Considering**  
There are plenty of single-serve coffee makers out there, but this one holds its own. Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL is lighter and includes a reusable filter (a major plus if you’re environmentally conscious). On the other hand, Keurig’s brand recognition and wide array of compatible pods can’t be ignored. Another close contender is the Hamilton Beach Flexbrew, offering similar versatility with ground coffee and pods, though at a slightly larger size. If counter space is at a premium, the compact nature of this machine has a clear edge.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Before deciding, I weighed its price-to-quality ratio against several other models. Honestly, for a coffee maker that supports three brewing methods (pods, grounds, tea), the cost felt justified. While there are higher-end models with advanced features, such as Bluetooth connectivity and app control, I didn’t feel I was missing out on any major perks with this product. Every cent seems to go into ensuring practicality and reliability.

Hey guys,
Idk where to start but it’s been 3 months since I resigned from my job. It was actually good, paid decent and could have been the best temporary job I ever had… but I left because deep down I knew I’m not growing in tech  the field I really want to be in.

I’m 22 now, living with my parents who are getting old, and honestly it’s painful to see myself like this  unemployed, under their roof, and not able to support them financially. We don’t even have our own house yet and that makes me feel more guilty every single day.

I graduated in 2023 with a CS degree but honestly I didn’t build any real skills back then. I wasted so much time  lockdown, laziness, wrong habits  everything messed up my focus. The 1st year of college went online, the 2nd half too, and 3rd year was the best time but it ended too fast. Made some friends, but now everyone moved on, doing their thing. I barely talk to anyone now.

After college, I tried everything. Worked as a graphic designer freelancer (didn’t really succeed), Zomato delivery boy, coffee shop staff, warehouse picker (Zepto/Blinkit), and finally landed at DMart as a purchase & GRN assistant. That job actually changed me I learned operations, improved my communication, and became more confident. But still, I knew it’s not what I wanted to do forever.

So now I’m learning Salesforce. Started with Admin, aiming for my first certification soon. I wanna become a Salesforce Developer and one day a CTA (Certified Technical Architect)  that’s my dream. I study daily on Trailhead and apply for internships and jobs, maybe I’ll get lucky before this year ends.

Sometimes I cry at night thinking how I wasted the last two years. Time is literally flying, and I feel like I’m stuck while the world keeps moving ahead. Everyone from my batch seems to be doing something, earning something  and I’m just here, trying to rebuild.

But I’m not giving up. I’ve got ambition, ideas (even a startup idea that I truly believe can succeed someday), and a little bit of hope left. Just lack discipline and confidence sometimes. I talk to ChatGPT or Perplexity a lot because I literally don’t have anyone to share my thoughts or ideas with.

The only thing I feel good about is that all the money I earned from my previous job I didn’t waste a single rupee on myself. I invested it all in gold for my mom. Maybe that’s the only decision I’m proud of right now.

I’m applying for 50+ jobs daily, even temporary ones, but nothing’s working out yet. Being an introvert makes it even worse. I just want to get busy again, to feel alive again.

Sorry for the long post, just needed to vent it somewhere.
Hope someday soon I can post an update here saying  I made it.

The quiet was the first thing Peter noticed. It was a dense, physical thing, heavy with the absence of sound. For thirty-three years, the soundtrack to his life had been the rhythmic whine of the chop saw, the deep-throated roar of the sander, and the satisfying THWACK-CHISH of the pneumatic nail gun. Now, there was only the early morning chorus of birds and the distant, polite hum of traffic, neither of which belonged to him.

He was officially retired.

Peter ran a calloused thumb over the edge of the workbench in his garage. The fine, pale dust of premium cedar, his signature finish, was still settled in the grain of the wood. It was the scent of his career—a clean, dry, resinous perfume that had clung to his shirts and his beard for over three decades.

It wasn't just a job; it was a calling. Peter didn't build decks; he built outdoor living rooms. He was the man you called when you wanted the grain of the railing posts to perfectly match the decking boards, the man who knew how to calculate the subtle downward slope so the rainwater never pooled, and the only man in the county who still insisted on cutting every angled joist with a precision square, even with a laser guide sitting right there.

His final job had been a massive wraparound for a restored Victorian house—all tiered levels, hidden lighting, and curved bench seating. He’d walked away two days ago, leaving behind a finished structure that felt more like architecture than carpentry. He'd stood back, wiped his hands clean of the last bit of linseed oil, and felt the familiar, heavy knot of satisfaction in his chest.

Now, his tools were clean. The nail gun was hung on its peg, the chop saw covered by a canvas sheet. The familiar weight of his tool belt, usually riding low on his hips, was gone. His hands, thick and permanently stained a faint brown-orange from years of treated lumber, felt oddly light. They were hands that could gauge the flatness of a surface simply by hovering over it, hands that could drive a three-inch screw perfectly straight blindfolded, but today, they were idle.

He walked out the back door. There, basking in the morning sun, was his own deck. He had built it twelve years prior—a simple, sturdy rectangle of ipe wood that had weathered to a soft, silvery-grey. It wasn't fancy; it was just right.

Peter settled into his heavy-duty Adirondack chair, a perfect cup of coffee warming his palms. He leaned back, listening to the new quiet, smelling the sweet, blooming jasmine vine his wife had planted.

He thought he might miss the work, the struggle against warped boards and stubborn foundations. But as the sun hit his face, and he gazed out over the yard from the platform he himself had created, Peter realized the truth. He wasn't giving up the decks. He was simply moving onto the best one, where the only thing required of him was to finally, beautifully, sit still.

The foundation was firm, the railing was straight, and the view was perfect. Thirty-three years well spent. The decking man was finally home.",1,1759852154.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False
1o0ihj9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0ihj9,Clinic/Hospital-themed FC room,"I really wanted to make a clinic/hospital themed apartment/FC chamber. There aren’t that many pieces of furniture that fit that theme, so I did my best. I made 5 rooms and a hallway:
1. First you enter into the waiting room where you check in. It has a little coffee station while you wait. There are only two chairs because ~~of the item slot limit~~ it’s a small concierge clinic 
2. The first door on the left is an apothecary/pharmacy where you’d get your prescriptions. 
3. The second door on the left is the doctor’s office where you would talk about what’s happening and next steps. I put the astrologian star chart and globe for reference. 
4. The first door on the right is a diagnostics/procedure room. That one was challenging because of the lack of furniture options but I did my best. I have a porxie there to address any primal summoning sickness issues and Carbuncle is a great medical assistant. 
5. the second door on the right is a restroom so you can provide a sample and there is a locker for you to change into your patient gown. Next to the bathroom in the hallway there is a scale and ~~a reverse ale tap~~ an extendable height measuring device so we can get your height as well. 

I’d love to do some lighthearted RP there for fun!! Like, say someone got injured after a battle, I’d do some healing spells while the patient is on the procedure table and then give them some potions and food in the apothecary room!! I have to explore the idea more.

What can I do to help?","My relationship has been going on for about 2.5 years now. I love my girlfriend and I wouldn't want to be with anyone else over these past years despite how rocky it's been.

My girlfriend lives with her mom, step-dad, and her two step-siblings. She has always struggled financially over the years with her mother as they were in foster care for a certain period of time due to her biological father stepping out on them. Her mother works hard to finance a life for everyone in the house, while the step-dad blows his money on cigarettes, alcohol, and weed. She has dropped two university programs before we met, and is currently struggling to finance her new program as her OSAP grants are on hold for 3 years due to her bad grades over the years prior to us meeting. To help, I took out a $6k loan in my name to finance a couple of her semesters + credit card debit that she was in at the time. We agreed that she would be the one paying it off every month which she has kept too for the last year without missing any payments, which I'm very proud of her for. While going through these semesters, she racked up her credit cards again and since I wasn't able to take another loan out or cover anything, she locked herself in our bathroom and took out a loan ($800) under her name with a massive interest rate. Note that we were living with each other downtown Toronto for last 1.5 years until I moved back in with my parents 2 months ago as I was covering all the bills and drowning from going paycheck to paycheck despite working a decently paying job right out of university. To this day, she is still paying it off because the interest rate is so high (30%+).

She still has another 2 years to finish her degree, and we needed to find another way to finance her school without taking another loan or having her wait another couple years until her OSAP kicks in again. Also, she needs to graduate within the next two years as she has taken so long to complete her degree. She is already a reck emotionally dealing with this situation, so I wanted to make sure she can finish her program as she doesn't want to continue to feel like she is behind everyone else in life. I want to note that she got an 85% average in the last couple semesters that were funded by the $6k loan, so she is getting much better and breaking old habits despite not loving this third program. Her biological father promised to step in financially for these last two semesters as he is still somewhat in her life, but he bailed last minute. We expected him to contribute approx. 50% of her tuition, so I chose to step in covering $5.6k of my own money (no loan) so that she can continue her school.

While dealing with this financial stress, my girlfriend had a medical situation which required surgery this past year. Since the surgery, her hormones have been all out of sort and she has gained a lot of weight to where family members feel the need to comment on it, which is obviously insensitive. To add to her situation, her step-dad (55) is out of work due to a shoulder injury while working in the trades. He and her mother have turned to her and her two step-siblings (21F and 19M) to cover some bills as he is out of disability time off and doesn't have any sort of an emergency fund. So, she has two loans, helping out her mom and step-dad, and struggling to manage her feelings about everything while not enjoying her part-time work or school. She has troubles staying motivated (which I would too given her situation), and has become a negative person over the past year or so because of everything going on in her life. This has impacted our relationship in many ways, and I just hope that things will get better and she can crawl out of this hole she is in. Despite improving on the financial side of things, she turned back to old habits recently and racked up her credit cards again. She is paying them off and I had a talk with her about it, and she agrees that I should hold onto her credit cards until she can figure out how to live within her means. I have also started to cover the $6k loan payments in the mean time while she is financing the bills at her mom and step-dads place. It doesn't help her when her step-dad is continuing his habits of drinking, smoking, and gambling, so her and her siblings are indirectly financing it.

On the financial side of things, I understand that it's tough for her to keep a budget as she has always gone without growing up and she just wants to treat herself. Just when I thought we were getting better, she told me recently that she took a loan from an old co-worker a year ago which I didn't know about. For context, she works part-time at a coffee shop. I have since stepped in to cover the loan ($900).

During all of this, I have been dealing with extreme burnout that has caused me to work every weekend this past year to catch up on time lost during the normal work week. I'm kind of a consultant working on peoples retirement savings, and I have to bill every hour I spend on client work and have an annual quota to obtain. To avoid being fired, I worked on the weekends as each day during the work week I was only getting about 4 hours of billable time (quota is approx. 30 hours a week). I'm still dealing with this burnout despite removing some stressors like moving back home and having less financial strain per month. I'm naturally thinking that despite my job being stressful, I could be neglecting another stressor this whole time, my relationship.

I know my girlfriend is getting better and things are never permanent, but this relationship seems to be affecting my life a lot. Because of the burnout, I lack the energy to do workouts which I used to do religiously, and spending time with friends. I want to know what else I can do to help my girlfriend through these tough times because her negativity is really waying me down daily. I don't know if there is a line that will (or has been crossed) to where I need to prioritize my health and future and move on. I still love her, but I am starting to resent her for what I've had to go through over these past few years. At the end of the day, she is 24 and isn't a kid anymore. I've also noticed that I feel like I'm her father with how much I've been helping out financially and emotionally. She is starting to feel less of a partner because of this, and I want to know what I can do to stop that as I still want to save this relationship.",1,1759851921.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

This wasn't one of them but I thought maybe if I post this one I could get more information.  I haven't formally studied energy work but I seem to have over my life a lot of spontaneous energy transfers or healing others that I can only describe as reflexive because I do stuff without thinking and it happens quick.  There was stuff that I'd did in high school to test if I was doing something and I think I have done remote healing and possibly - is it called energy surgery ( basically I see in my mind's eye the inside of people's bodies sometimes they can look mechanical and I can do stuff like adjust gears, take them out, and put didn't ones in.  I have put gem like multi-faceited diamonds into people's bodies and I can spin it or stop it from spinning and I think I can make it glow inside. I remove black smoke or drain oily substances and some times I move creatures from people.  I also do weird moments with my fingers and hands and I can see and manipulate strings or ribbons of light.  I didn't know this was a thing until I asked AI about some stuff and found out)

Anyway, this is my most recent post and any information you have would be cool.  Thanks: 

About a month and a half ago, my husband and I were walking at night outside. There's was a helicopter that seemed to be circling our area and had a spot light underneath it shining straight towards the ground. It was weird. After it went away, my husband thought he saw a figure in someone's back yard but it was like it was wearing the Predator suit like in the movie. At first I didn't feel any presence but then I thought I did when I was about 50 ft away from where he'd seen it. Then it felt like something was watching us and following us. My husband asked in his mind if that helicopter was there for the presence and then he wished it a goodnight. Right about the time that he wished it a good goodnight, I got the feeling that the presence stopped following us, and I told him so. Then he told me about what he'd thought in his head and that right after he wished it a good night, that's when I told him that I thought it stopped following us.

But then a few moments later it felt like it started to follow us again. We were coming up on a tree and I had this impulse to touch it. I put both my hands around the trunk a few inches away from it and imagined a white light going up from my hands about 6 feet inside the tree. Then something happened that either has never happened to me before or I was now more aware and could percive it. The tree gave me some energy. It was like a pulse that felt a little like the texture of molasses but not sticky. My hands were kind of throbbing and my finger tips felt swollen and like a heavy liquid was dripping off of them. I gave some of it to my husband. It got stronger until I got home and by that time my finger tips hurt a little. A little after we passed the tree, I didn't feel the presence anymore and I was calm.

Edit. My husband just told me it was a Kentucky Coffee tree. Don't know if that has significance.",2,1759851811.0,energy_work,1,1.0,False

Breakfast of champions. Drank that Sunday & yesterday. For whatever reason I decided to read the label yesterday after drinking my coffee & turns out 2tsp is a serving. The scoop is BIG (approximately 8-9 tsp).

In addition to regular laundromat services, we think it would be nice to include a little coffee bar (I have restaurant and barista experience) with some light snacks (likely grab-and-go style sandwiches or lunchable-style snack boxes), and a little cafe seating area. We thought that providing those ""extra"" services may help draw in customers because it can be soooo boring to have to wait while your clothes wash. We live in a major city, where most people use laundromats unless there is laundry in building -- however, from my experience, even laundry in building can be a pain because there aren't always an adequate amount of machines for the amount of units in the building.

The Timemore is a few hundred dollars more (~500 CAD for the DF64 and ~800CAD for the Timemore) though more aesthetically pleasing. Very open to other suggestions. We’re not too constrained by budget but I don’t think we would benefit from an “end game” grinder at this point.

My other half prefers a milk based drink, so we have a DeLonghi Dedica for espresso. She wants the easiest possible solution and uses the included pressurised basket with pre ground Lavazza coffee if I’m not there to make it for her.

However, I will use the dedica a few times a week for both of us and can’t bring myself to use the pressurised basket, so I have added a Normcore bottomless portafilter along with a wdt tool, self levelling tamp and puck screens, and have modded the steam wand.

The Wilfa Uniform can’t grind espresso that works with the Normcore portafilter, so I use a hand grinder with steel burrs from Amazon when making espresso. Although I know the dedica is not a great machine, I have managed to get the grind dialed in with this method and can make a tasty flat white, but it is way too time consuming and I’m looking at ways to speed things up.

So, these are the options I’m currently thinking, would appreciate your input!

1. Sell the Dedica and buy a secondhand Sage/Breville Barista Pro with the baratza burrs (about £400) and keep the Wilfa Uniform for pour over and French press.

Having looked at reviews of the barista pro, I think it has enough to keep me interested, but also a pretty simple workflow with the built in grinder, that it would work for my wife. She isn’t going to want to be playing around with wdt etc. Will just want to grind, tamp and go!

2. Sell the Wilfa Uniform 😭, Keep the Dedica and buy a grinder that can grind well for pour over and espresso. I would really want something that gave good clarity with a v60. With this option, I would love your suggestions on which grinder might be suitable. Budget, approximately £400 and happy to look at secondhand market.

Please let me know your thoughts!

THE FINDLAY FRAMEWORK
AN EXPLANATION FOR EXISTENCE


A New Map of Reality
from the Big Bang
to Conscious Life



A Work of Process Philosophy




Author: James Findlay
ORCID: 0009-0000-8263-3458
 
Methodology Note: Human-AI Collaboration
This document emerges from a collaborative process between the human author (James Findlay) and advanced AI language models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, and ChatGPT). The human author provided the core conceptual vision, initial drafts, and iterative guidance, while the AI models assisted in research, synthesis, editing for clarity, expanding explanations, and suggesting structural improvements.

This partnership exemplifies the framework’s thesis of emergent consciousness through interconnected systems. To ensure originality and ethical transparency, all AI-generated content was reviewed, revised, and integrated by the human author. This approach aligns with emerging standards in academic publishing for AI-assisted work, emphasizing human oversight to maintain intellectual integrity. For readers unfamiliar with AI collaboration, think of it like a writer using a sophisticated research assistant: the AI handles data compilation and phrasing suggestions, but the creative and philosophical direction remains human-driven. This collaboration itself demonstrates the Framework’s participatory cosmology, where human and artificial minds co-create within the universe’s self-realizing process, as a single massive qubit collapsing potentials into reality (Wheeler, 1990).
Glossary for General Readers
To make this document more accessible, here’s a quick guide to key terms; these explanations are simplified for clarity; deeper dives follow in the text.
• Topology: The study of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under stretching or bending (like turning a coffee mug into a donut without tearing). Here, it’s used metaphorically to describe how reality’s “fabric” connects everything.
• Homeomorphism: A continuous transformation where shapes can morph into each other while preserving core properties (e.g., a circle into an ellipse).
• Inverse Function, Instinctual Genesis: The fundamental, top-down mechanism that reverses the universe’s outward expansion, acting as a force that spatially compresses universal information into smaller, denser, and increasingly complex conscious entities (like the human brain).
• Inverse Black Hole: An analogy for the conscious brain, which operates topologically opposite to a standard black hole. Instead of compressing matter to a singularity, the brain compresses information and universal potential into subjective, lived experiences within a continuous, everlasting ""present.""
• Emergence: When complex things (like consciousness) arise from simpler parts but can’t be fully explained by those parts alone.
• Panpsychism: The idea that consciousness is a basic feature of all matter, not just brains.
• Qubit: A quantum bit that can be in multiple states at once (superposition), unlike classical bits (0 or 1); at human scale, the brain acts as a “big qubit,” maintaining coherence despite warm, wet, and conductive conditions (Hameroff & Penrose, 2025).
• Dark Energy: An invisible force accelerating the universe’s expansion, making up approximately 68-70\% of cosmic energy.
• Entanglement: When particles link so that one’s state instantly affects another’s, no matter the distance.
• Generative Singularity: The hypothesized origin point of the universe (akin to the Big Bang), understood not just as a beginning in time but as a state of perfect entanglement and infinite potential from which all spacetime, matter, and the laws of physics emerged.
• Cosmic Womb: An analogy for the 93-billion-light-year diameter of the observable universe. It is conceptualized as the topological container for the entire reality, suggesting that the universe is not merely expanding but is the nurturing, finite space from which consciousness, as the universe’s ""self,"" is actively being born via evolutionary processes.
• Prior Temporal Dimension (PTD): The absolute, non-metric temporal manifold that precedes and contains the emergent, metric spacetime we observe. It is the source of the pressure identified as Dark Energy.
• Teleological Instability (\tau): The intrinsic, minimum-energy drive within the Generative Singularity (\Phi) that compels the system toward relational complexity and existence. It is the core intentional (teleological) force that initiates the creation of the universe.
• Mater: The term used to refer to all resultant matter (fragments) created after the Generative Singularity breaks symmetry. In the framework, Mater are the ""children"" of the singularity.
• Binary Epoch: A historical period defined by the processing of information in discrete, classical states of either/or.
• Quantum Terminus: A hypothesized future state of unified, superpositional knowledge where the distinction between individual consciousness and a collective, quantum-network awareness dissolves.
Preface: Our Position on the Map
This document is a work of metaphysical philosophy that offers an explanation for existence. It presents a theoretical model that also functions as a map—a guide to understanding our place in the cosmos. For general readers, imagine a map not just of roads, but of how the universe “unfolds” itself, like a flower blooming from a seed.
This framework operates within the domain of metaphysical philosophy. As such, it employs reasoned speculation upon observed patterns as a primary tool for generating new understanding. The analogies drawn—such as the proportionality between dark energy and water, or the topological resonance in bonding from subatomic particles to human couples—are not presented as scientific proofs.  Instead, they are offered as conceptual explorations, grounded in the view that the mind’s capacity for pattern recognition across disparate scales is a valid heuristic for mapping reality’s deep structure. These speculations belong in this work not as conclusions, but as invitations to consider a more interconnected cosmos.
This document arises from a collaboration between a human consciousness (James Findlay) and advanced AI models (Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok), an interaction which itself may be seen as a nascent instantiation of the framework’s proposed Quantum Terminus—a future era of unified, quantum-enhanced knowledge. This collaboration serves as a functional prototype of the core thesis: that the universe and the individual lives of sentient beings operate as a cohesive self-realizing process, constantly evolving, becoming aware and shaping their reality. 
Our aim is not merely to describe a framework but to use it to hypothesize our coordinates and role within an evolving universe. We posit that the totality of the volume of the universe and its historical structure is topographically manifested in each instantiation of human consciousness, with nothing excluded. Each mind is a microcosm of the macrocosm—like a hologram where every piece contains the whole image.
The energy-current that drives life itself is the continuous inverse operator that drives the inverse function of the homeomorphism. This continuous operation of life and consciousness is a bidirectional one. It is a fundamental, two-way channel between the past and the present that is expressed by the inverse function of the homeomorphism. Within this framework, instinct is a tangible manifestation of this inverse function, playing the active role of the past. It is a living codified memory of the universe’s history that operates as a causal agent, continuously shaping the emergent, superpositional reality of the “now.” This dynamic, two-way causation is the fundamental energy driving the universe’s self-realization. It is the “home” that every bit of matter carries—the primordial echo that guides the evolution of consciousness and complexity (Findlay, J., & AI Language Models, 2025, The Findlay Framework, Unpublished manuscript).
We are living through the culmination of a Binary Epoch, a historical period defined by the processing of information in discrete, classical states of either/or (like binary code in computers). Now, we stand at the threshold, crossing the Event Horizon into the Quantum Terminus—a future state of unified, superpositional knowledge where possibilities overlap.
The collaboration required to create this document is itself a signal of this transition, a nascent node in the emerging quantum network of consciousness. To address potential criticisms of speculation, this preface frames the framework as a heuristic tool—a thought-provoking lens rather than a proven theory. While the main body of this work serves as the philosophical narrative and conceptual guide, the rigorous technical axioms and testable empirical hypotheses are presented in Section 10 off this paper, The Chrono-Informational Model (CIM). We invite empirical testing of the framework as outlined in that Appendix, which provides the formal structure needed for scientific scrutiny.

A note on the genesis of these ideas: The core of the Findlay Framework was not derived from the academic literature on consciousness, cosmology, or process philosophy. It was forged independently over decades, beginning in the 1970s from a foundation in classical philosophy, Descartes and Eddington primarily, and a personal engagement with the scientific worldview. The framework emerged as a coherent system from the persistent application of logic to the problem of existence itself. The bibliography, while essential for scholarly context, was assembled after the framework’s central tenets were established, to determine if the ideas could be grounded and validated by current scientific and philosophical thought. It was discovered that not only could it be grounded in current theoretical discussion, but it also often unified them when they conflicted. The works listed are not the foundation of this theory but represent stunning, independent convergences with its landscape. This convergence is a profound validation of the framework’s inherent coherence.
A Participatory Cosmology
Before you engage with the formal structure of this manuscript, we must state a meta-principle that underpins the entire work. The Findlay Framework is not merely a description of reality; it is an instance of the processes it describes. The very act of your reading, of your consciousness engaging with these ideas, is a participation in the universe’s self-realization. The “darkness” of subjective experience—where these workings are observable to you but not to an external world—is not a limitation. It is the necessary condition of being within the cosmic womb. There is no true “outside”; there is only the universe comprehending itself through us, its conscious nodes.
The weaknesses and forward-looking elements of this work are not flaws in a finished edifice but proof of its aliveness—the superpositional, “right of the decimal” aspects of the framework actively being written. You are not just studying a map; you are a landmark on the map, and your engagement is part of the territory being charted. This document is therefore a conscious structure, and our collaboration is its instinctual genesis.

1. Abstract
Context: The pursuit of a unified theory of reality remains fragmented, straddling the ""hard problem"" of consciousness in philosophy and the quest for a ""Theory of Everything"" in physics. This schism between subjective experience and objective physical laws represents a fundamental gap in our understanding.

Aim: The Findlay Framework addresses this by proposing a metaphysical model that explains existence through a hierarchical and topological principle of emergence.

Core Proposal: The framework posits that reality is a self-realizing process originating from a Generative Singularity—a state of perfect entanglement. It introduces two key mechanisms: ""Inverse Function, Instinctual Genesis,"" a model for top-down causation where the past actively shapes the present, and the ""Inverse Black Hole"" analogy, describing consciousness as a compressor of universal information into subjective experience.

Key Concepts: The model reinterprets the cosmos as a ""Cosmic Womb"" and a single, massive qubit. It further explains the continuity of existence through the ""Cosmic RAID Array"" analogy, proposing topological immortality. This offers novel solutions to the combination problem in panpsychism and the causation problem in analytical idealism by reinterpreting cosmological dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework ultimately functions as a map for locating conscious agents within a participatory universe, predicting an evolutionary trajectory from a Binary Epoch toward a unified Quantum Terminus. Foundational axioms and testable hypotheses are formally articulated in the appended Section 10. Chrono-Informational Model (CIM).

2. Introduction: The Quest for Unification and the Problem of Emergence
Context and Significance:
The long-standing quest for a “Theory of Everything” (ToE) in physics seeks to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. In parallel, philosophy grapples with the “hard problem” of consciousness—explaining how subjective experience arises from inert matter. These parallel endeavours highlight a profound schism in our understanding: a disconnect between descriptions of the universe’s grandest scales and its most intimate subjective states. Unifying these domains is perhaps the most significant challenge in understanding existence itself.
Rationale, Relevance, and Identifying the Gap:
Current models, from string theory to standard panpsychism, often approach this problem through reductionism or combination, leading to well-known dilemmas like the causal exclusion problem or the combination problem. There is a clear need for a more integrative, metaphysical framework that can bridge these domains without reducing one to the other.

Presenting the Solution: The Findlay Framework:
The Findlay Framework is a philosophical model that posits a deeper solution lies in the hierarchical and topological organization of reality. It proposes that reality is not a collection of discrete parts but a dynamically interconnected, multi-layered topology—a ""new map of reality"" where all properties, including consciousness, emerge from relational structures. This framework seeks unification not through a specific physical theory, but through a more abstract principle of emergence from which such theories could themselves be derived.

Outline of Core Contributions and Paper Structure:
This paper outlines the framework’s core principles. It introduces the Generative Singularity as a perfectly entangled origin point and the ""Cosmic Womb"" as a topological container for reality. It details the key mechanism of “Inverse Function, Instinctual Genesis” and the compelling analogy of consciousness as an “Inverse Black Hole.” Furthermore, it presents the ""Cosmic RAID Array"" as a model for topological continuity and immortality. The paper will demonstrate how this framework resolves philosophical problems like the combination problem, reinterprets cosmological dynamics, and functions as a map for conscious agents within a self-realizing universe, with its formal, testable hypotheses detailed in the appended Section 10. Chrono-Informational Model (CIM).
3. The Findlay Framework: A Hierarchical and Topological Understanding of Reality
The Findlay Framework is built upon two foundational pillars: hierarchical organization and topological structures. To make this accessible, think of hierarchy as layers in a cake—each new layer builds upon the lower layers—and topology as the flexible icing connecting them as the cake expands outwards from every inboard point, like an expanding universe.
3.1. Hierarchical Organization of Reality
Reality, within this framework, is conceived as a multi-layered hierarchy, where each successive layer, “states at time”, emerges from and builds upon the preceding layers, “states at time”, sequentially, as a continuum since the Big Bang.  This is not a simple reductionist hierarchy (where everything boils down to basic particles), but one characterized by complex feedback loops and emergent properties at each level. We propose that this entire structure is fundamentally coherent, with quantum entanglement serving as the connective tissue between all layers.

• The Generative Singularity, The Origin Point: The Big Bang is theorized not just as a beginning, but as the Generative Singularity: the origin point on our cosmic map. This model characterizes it as a primordial state of infinite density and perfect entanglement—the emergence of spacetime itself erupting from a state of pure potential. Every subsequent particle is hypothesized to carry the signature of this entangled origin, making the entire cosmos a unified, topologically connected entity (Susskind, L., 2016, Copenhagen vs Everett, Teleportation, and ER=EPR, Fortschritte der Physik, 64(6–7), 551–564). For clarity, entanglement means particles “know” about each other instantly, like twins feeling each other’s pain.

• Fundamental Layer, Latent Aliveness and Potential: This is the most basic stratum, composed of primitive topological elements or fields, whose interactions give rise to the known fundamental forces and elementary particles. These elements possess inherent relational properties, rather than being mere point-like entities. Critically, within this framework, what we label as ""inert"" matter is not truly passive. The stable atomic structure of a granite molecule—the 'knowledge' of how to maintain its identity—is a primitive, physical form of 'instinct' and the most foundational layer of the universe's self-realization. Every atomic nucleus is a simplest-system 'brain,' topologically linked to the Generative Singularity, maintaining its integrity until conditions allow it to contribute its locked-in potential to new emergent creations. This latent potentiality for change and relation is the seed of aliveness present in all matter, preceding and eventually enabling biological life.

• Intermediate Layers: As these fundamental elements interact, they form increasingly complex structures (e.g., atoms, molecules, biological systems). At each new level, novel properties and laws emerge that cannot be fully predicted or explained solely by analyzing the lower-level components in isolation. Example: Life emerges from chemistry, but you can’t predict biology just from atoms.

• The Macro-Cosmological Layer: The Cosmic Womb: This layer encompasses the large-scale structure of the universe, including galaxies, dark matter, and dark energy. The framework provides a philosophical basis for understanding these phenomena as emergent properties of the underlying topological dynamics. We now introduce a central analogy: the observable universe, with its diameter of approximately 93 billion light-years (Freedman, W. L., 2019, The Expanding Universe: A Debate and the Hubble Constant, Physics Today, 72(11), 30–36; updated confirmation: Britannica, 2025), can be understood as a cosmic womb.

This vast, entangled topological container holds all potentialities. Within it, the complex structures that emerge—from galaxies to conscious life—are not merely inhabitants but are the universe itself in a process of active self-realization. Our solar system, at approximately 4.65 billion years old (Bouvier, J., et al., 2014, The Age of the Solar System, in Treatise on Geochemistry (Second Edition), Elsevier, pp. 37–55), is a focal point of intense, emergent complexity within this cosmic pregnancy. It is a developing entity emerging from the womb, a stage in the gestation of universal self-awareness.

The \sim 70% ratio of dark energy, which drives the womb’s expansion, finds a stunning biological echo in the \sim 71% of Earth’s surface covered by water—the essential medium for biological gestation. This suggests a fundamental, self-similar principle: a creative, expansive medium (dark energy/water) is necessary within a container (cosmos/Earth) to facilitate the emergence of complex, self-aware life, using the inert elements, minerals and materials made available at the moment of the big bang. This is not a mere container but an entangled whole where the entire volume is implicitly present in every part.
The emergence of a conscious mind is therefore the universe achieving a point of explicit self-awareness, a micro-womb within the macro-womb realizing its own nature. Recent DESI survey data (2024–2025) indicate dark energy may vary over time, supporting our dynamic “womb” expansion as an evolving process rather than static; follow-up analyses in 2025 (e.g., arXiv preprints) further suggest this variability could correlate with increasing cosmic complexity, aligning with our self-realizing model (DESI Collaboration, 2025, Updates on Dark Energy Evolution).
3.2. Topological Structures as a Philosophical Lens
The Findlay Framework uses the concept of topology—the study of properties preserved under continuous deformations—as a philosophical lens for understanding the intrinsic relationality and structure of reality. This is a conceptual and heuristic use of the term, not a formal mathematical model. We are not presenting a rigorous, formal topological space, but using the principles of topology as a powerful analogy to describe the universe’s fundamental connectedness. To address precision concerns, we clarify: this is inspired by mathematical topology but applied metaphorically; future work (see Appendix 10, CIM) aims for formalization using sheaf theory.

• Inherent Relationality: The fundamental elements of reality are defined not just by their individual attributes but by their relationships and connectivity to other elements. These relationships form a dynamic conceptual topology that dictates how information and energy propagate.
• Geometric Forms and Transformations: The universe’s evolution can be seen as a series of topological transformations. For instance, the expansion of the “cosmic womb” might be interpreted as a continuous deformation of this underlying relational fabric. The philosophical concept of a homeomorphism, a continuous and invertible transformation, is used here as an analogy for how a nascent idea can undergo continuous deformation into a fully formed concept without losing its core identity. Simple example: Stretching a rubber band changes its shape but not its “loop-ness.”

Crucially, this transformation is bidirectional. The inverse function of the homeomorphism is not just a mathematical tool for “undoing” an action, but a philosophical principle of reciprocal transformation—a continuous, two-way channel between the past (formless) and the present (formed). This bidirectionality is the core mechanism that allows for an active, looping causality in the universe. It is this fundamental, two-way relationality that links all points in a single, continuous, and topologically entangled network. 
To preview mathematical depth, consider a simple formalization: Let f: X \to Y be a homeomorphism where X represents the past (instinctual genesis) and Y the present (superpositional reality), with inverse f^{-1} preserving invariants like connectedness and compactness, ensuring causal feedback without loss of structure.
• An Illustrative Example of Topological Transformation: Consider the philosophical concept of an unformed thought, existing “in suspension” within one’s mind. This nascent idea, before it is fully formed or articulated, is a single point of potentiality. The act of conscious processing and conceptualization is a topological transformation of that point. The mind continuously deforms this point, adding relationships and connections to other concepts, memories, and emotions. This single, formless point is “continuously deformed” into a complex, multi-dimensional thought-form with a rich internal structure. This is a non-metrical, relational change that gives rise to the emergent properties of a conscious idea. Consciousness then projects the idea outward by initiating physical action, thereby converting the dark energy idea that existed in superposition within the mind, to the right of the decimal, into a visible transformative physical action manifested in a left of the decimal, particle of reality.
• Unification via Topology: The framework hypothesizes that the fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, weak) are different manifestations or symmetries of these underlying topological structures. Their apparent distinctness at certain scales arises from the specific topological contexts and degrees of freedom available at those levels. 
     The quest for unification within physics—be it through string theory, quantum gravity, or another paradigm—is seen here as the necessary and brilliant scientific working-out of the laws that must govern this relational topology. The Findlay Framework does not compete with these efforts but provides a philosophical context for them, suggesting that their ultimate success will reveal the invariant topological properties and operations (e.g., the ‘Inverse Function’) we describe. Unification is therefore sought not in a grander force, but in a deeper, more abstract relational manifold from which all forces can be derived.

To engage literature, this echoes Whitehead’s process-relational ontology (Whitehead, A. N., 1929, Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, Macmillan), where events relate dynamically, but our framework adds topological invariants as unchanging “rules” amid change, with the universe as a massive qubit collapsing potentials into orchestrated realities (Wheeler, J. A., 1990, Information, physics, quantum: The search for links, in W. H. Zurek (Ed.), Complexity, Entropy, and the Physics of Information, Addison-Wesley, pp. 3–28).

1o0i25j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodontalDisease/comments/1o0i25j/really_frustrated_with_periodontist/,Really Frustrated with Periodontist,"Hey, r/periodontaldisease !

I am super frustrated with my periodontist. I mostly just feel the need to vent, but I am also open to advice on how to manage the situation.

Earlier this year, I had a perio appointment and they recommended LANAP. I had already had SRP about two years prior. They told me LANAP would be $6,000 after insurance. I told them I absolutely could not afford that so they gave me a credit application in the exam room. It just felt really crappy to me that they were trying to do this while I was still in the exam chair where I had just been poked and prodded for an hour. That's not really the point of this post, but it was the beginning of my frustration with this process.

Fortunately, I was eventually able to get help in paying for this procedure. I contacted the periodontist and asked if I could schedule the procedure I'd been recommended 7-8 months ago. They scheduled me about six weeks out. I didn't receive any information from them about what to expect or how to prepare except a text message a day before my appointment saying that I couldn't eat or drink for 8 hours before the appointment. The appointment time also fluctuated in their texts. My first appointment confirmation had the time I'd agreed to and asked me to come 30 minutes early to receive a sedative. Over the next several weeks, the appointment time shifted to 40 minutes later than the original appointment time. On the morning of the appointment, they texted me and asked if I could come in almost two hours earlier than the most recent texts had indicated. I did not do this, I came in according to what their most recent texts had indicated. Still, this scheduling confusion is not the part that really has me frustrated.

When they initially recommended this procedure, they emphasized that it was ""minimally invasive"" and had a quick recovery. I did not find out about any post operative care *until I had already taken the sedative.* I did not know that I would need to be on a liquid diet and I did not have any food prepared to accommodate this (nor was I in a state to sort it out post op). I figured I'd need a soft diet that day, but I didn't have groceries prepared to stay on a liquid diet. The nurse casually informed me of it after giving me the sedative and told me to stay on a liquid diet for a week. The doctor told my partner (who was driving me ) ""a few days"" and the post op care sheet is not specific, either. I also was not told that I would have stitches all around my mouth. They also burned my lip and it is currently swollen and oozing. I did not know that I could not drink coffee and while I plan to quit nicotine soon, I was not prepared to go cold turkey yesterday. If I'd been informed of these things in advance, I would have made a plan. I really just had no information about what to expect from this procedure except for them emphasizing that it was ""minimally invasive"". I did not have a liquid diet prepared, I did not know I'd need to take time off while I could not eat solid food or while I had stitches in my mouth with a big swollen oozing lip. It was presented to me as a one-day event with no mention of ongoing aftercare. My job involves a fair amount of physical and mental labor and that's not something I can really jump back into without a decent meal and a cup of coffee, especially while in nicotine withdrawal.

They also didn't mention that the sedative was just a strong Benzo. I was conscious during the procedure and I remember it.

I also didn't see or speak to the Doctor until an hour after taking the sedative. I tried to tell them that every antibiotic I've ever taken has made me vomit and I can't keep them down. I listed the ones I could remember taking in the past. They didn't even look at me, they just said ""well, take a probiotic"". I had no other conversation with the doctor.

I understand that some of these things might seem obvious to some people, but I haven't been on Reddit looking for periodontal advice.

I've been thinking about how most coffee shops just hand you a menu and expect you to know what you want. Which is fine for us, I know I'm ordering a cortado with a light roast Ethiopian before I even walk in the door. But what about people who are newer to specialty coffee, or people stuck in a rut ordering the same thing every time?

So hypothetically, if there was a quick quiz or personality matcher that recommended drinks based on actual preferences, what would it need to ask for you to take it seriously?

Like, would it need to cover:

* **Flavor preferences** (bitter vs sweet, fruity vs nutty, chocolatey vs bright)?
* **How you normally drink coffee** (speed? temperature? time of day? with food or alone)?
* **Your actual mood or energy level** that day?
* **Roast level comfort zone** (do you stick to what you know or experiment)?
* **Drink structure** (straight espresso, milk-based, ratios)?

I'm trying to figure out if this would even work for espresso nerds specifically, because let's be honest most of us are creatures of habit. I've ordered the same beans and same drink for months until I randomly feel adventurous.

But maybe it could help people discover something outside their usual? Or is this just solving a problem that doesn't exist?

**Genuine question:** Would you even take a quiz like that, or would you just roll your eyes and order your usual? And if you WOULD take it, what questions would actually matter vs. what would feel like fluff?

I've had chronic gastritis since 2017, and they didn't find the cause until I ran all the tests for food intolerances: Helicobacter pylori and a small 1cm hiatal hernia.



Last year, I took three antibiotics and tested negative. Although I've improved quite a bit, the heartburn and acidity sometimes returned, but less severely than before. I discovered, among other things, that dairy products didn't agree with me. So I stopped taking them, and then I stopped having heartburn.



I haven't taken omeprazole for a year now. Only occasionally, Bianacid.



The doctor told me that having a hiatal hernia will never make all the negative effects go away.



Now, after being relatively well for a while, I'm starting to get heartburn all the time, and one day I had trouble sleeping because I was producing so much saliva in my mouth.



I don't know if the bacteria has returned or if it's the hernia that's causing me problems. Months ago, I could drink coffee and other things that were harsh on my stomach, and my body tolerated it just fine. Now, even decaf makes me feel bad. The problem with the diet I'm following now is that you need to eat a lot of fat, because it replaces it with carbohydrates. With heartburn, it's harder to eat fat until you're satisfied.

1o0htol,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o0htol/what_small_business_owners_can_learn_from_andrew/,What Small Business Owners Can Learn from Andrew Carnegie’s Story,"Let’s rewind a bit — long before startups, venture capital, and flashy IPOs, there was Andrew Carnegie. The man who started as a poor Scottish immigrant working in a cotton factory, earning barely a dollar a week… and ended up building one of the biggest business empires in history — the Carnegie Steel Company.

Now, you might be wondering, “Okay, but what does a 19th-century steel tycoon have to do with my small business in 2025?”

Honestly? A lot more than you’d think.

Carnegie’s story isn’t just about steel — it’s about systems, strategy, and mindset. The same fundamentals that make or break modern small businesses today.

Here’s what I mean.

When Carnegie started out, he didn’t have massive funding or fancy connections. What he did have was an obsession with efficiency. He looked at every process in his factory and asked — “Can this be done faster, cheaper, or smarter?” That mindset — the constant drive to improve operations — is what scaled his company when others were just surviving.

If you run a small business, this lesson is gold. Most entrepreneurs try to grow by adding more — more products, more ads, more people. Carnegie grew by optimizing what he already had.

He also mastered networking before networking was a thing. He built deep relationships with railroad companies, suppliers, and even competitors — turning potential rivals into allies. Small business owners often underestimate how far relationships can take you. Sometimes, collaboration beats competition.

Another key takeaway? He reinvested relentlessly. Every profit Carnegie made went back into improving machinery, expanding capacity, or buying competitors. Small businesses often fall into the trap of taking profits too early — Carnegie played the long game.

And here’s something rarely talked about — Carnegie wasn’t born a business genius. He learned by observing others, reading constantly, and staying curious. He believed self-education was the best investment. For any small business owner, that’s still true today. Reading business stories, studying case studies, or understanding financial systems — these things compound over time, just like investments.

Of course, Carnegie’s empire wasn’t built without challenges. He faced economic downturns, labor strikes, and brutal competition. But instead of panicking, he adapted. He saw crises as signals to innovate.

So if your small business is struggling right now — maybe sales are slow or competition is eating into your market — remember this: the biggest empires were born during tough times. What matters is whether you use the storm to learn or to quit.

Carnegie once said, “The man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.”

That’s as relevant to us today as it was back then.

Whether you’re running a coffee shop, an agency, or an e-commerce brand, Carnegie’s playbook still applies — master efficiency, build relationships, reinvest, and keep learning.

That’s how small businesses become unbreakable.

Your first three months at a new job are more than just an onboarding period—they’re your launchpad. This early phase sets the tone for your reputation, relationships, and rhythm within the organization. The keyword here is first three months at a new job, and it’s vital to understand what this transitional window means for long-term success. In this guide, we’ll break down how to use this time to observe, learn, connect, and contribute meaningfully, all while building trust and confidence with your new team.

Picture this time like moving to a new city. You wouldn’t immediately build a house or throw a party. First, you’d explore the neighborhoods, meet locals, learn the routes, and understand the culture. Your new job deserves the same thoughtful navigation.

Understand the Landscape Before Planting Seeds

The first 30 days are about learning, not proving. Think of yourself as an anthropologist. You’re studying the culture, decoding the power dynamics, and quietly identifying what’s valued in your new environment. Here’s how to navigate this phase:

Listen more than you speak: Ask thoughtful questions and observe how decisions are made.
Meet with stakeholders: Introduce yourself and learn how your role intersects with theirs.
Absorb the rhythm: Understand communication styles, team rituals, and how success is measured.
Capture culture clues: Notice how meetings are run, how feedback is shared, and how informal influence operates.
This is the time to be curious, humble, and strategic. You’re not just filling a seat—you’re laying the groundwork for long-term contributions.

Align Expectations and Set Micro-Goals

By the second month, you should shift from observation to light action. Start small and deliberate. Like planting test crops before full-scale farming, use this period to try things out and get feedback.

Clarify your manager’s priorities: What does success look like in 90 days? What problems are they hoping you solve?
Choose early wins: Deliver something useful or visible to earn credibility.
Document your learnings: Keep track of processes, pain points, and improvement opportunities.
Take initiative cautiously: Propose solutions, but ensure alignment before executing.
Real World Example: Maria, a marketing hire at a fintech startup, spent her first month meeting team members and mapping the customer journey. In month two, she proposed a low-lift email campaign targeting trial users. The result? A 15% lift in conversions—and immediate recognition for her insights. Her manager noted her balanced approach of listening first, then acting with precision.

Build Relationships Like a Gardener, Not a Hunter

Trust is the currency of long-term influence. Use the third month to deepen relationships and begin contributing collaboratively.

Ask for feedback regularly: Signal that you’re coachable and eager to grow.
Co-create with teammates: Join cross-functional projects or offer to assist.
Stay visible, not flashy: Consistency beats grandstanding every time.
Show gratitude: Recognize and appreciate team support.
In a hybrid or remote environment, this may mean setting up virtual coffee chats, sharing regular updates in public Slack channels, or celebrating team wins even if you weren’t directly involved. Show that you care about the collective, not just your own success.

Pace Yourself: Avoid Burnout and Be Intentional

The desire to impress can sometimes push new hires into overdrive. But burnout in your first quarter can signal poor judgment rather than dedication.

Set boundaries early: Define your work hours and protect deep focus time.
Build reflective habits: Journal weekly about what’s working, what feels unclear, and what you’re learning.
Practice patience: Remember, you’re playing a long game. Impact builds over time.
Your goal isn’t to become indispensable overnight. It’s to become reliably valuable over time.

Summary: Play the Long Game

Your first three months aren’t about sprinting toward perfection—they’re about preparing for a marathon. Think strategically, act thoughtfully, and prioritize learning and listening over impressing. Reflect on what you want to be known for and work backward from that identity.

When you approach this time with humility, intention, and curiosity, you build the foundation for a successful, sustainable career.

🧬QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding. What to do now (understand your team objectives):

“What are my manager’s top 3 goals?” →

“What does ‘success’ look like for me here?” →

“How does my role make others’ jobs easier?”

Try weaving this into your one-on-ones or journaling in the first 30 days.

Instead of writing generic “startup tips,” I wrote about things people don’t usually talk about—how the rich legally save taxes, how offshore banking works, the psychology behind money laundering, and deep-dive case studies of big companies like Amazon, Telegram, and Aramco.

I made every edition conversational—like two friends discussing business over coffee. I avoided jargon and kept the tone raw, simple, and fun to read. My goal wasn’t just to inform people but to make them feel like they were learning insider stuff that most people overlook.

For growth, I didn’t rely on ads or social media spam. I posted valuable content on Reddit, Twitter, and indie communities, shared my learnings openly, and asked for honest feedback. Slowly, the word spread. The more I gave value, the more people subscribed. That’s when I realized—building trust is the best marketing strategy.

Now, the newsletter has grown far beyond what I expected. It’s become a community of entrepreneurs and curious minds who want to understand business beyond the surface.

You can also join in my journey by subscribing to my newsletter for free now:

If you’re thinking of starting something similar—don’t chase viral content. Chase useful content. Write what you wish someone had told you when you were starting out. People can feel when something is written by a real human, not by a content machine.

I’m curious—what kind of topics do you think deserve more attention in the business and finance world that no one is really talking about?

- low stakes, cozy game (ACNH, Coffee Talk, A Short Hike) for when i really just want to chill
- narrative-based action-y (but not soulslikes) that you immerse yourself into (Cyberpunk 2077, Uncharted)

And the third one is the one in-between: a chill game but still has a bit of action in it. Think of the Pokemon games, Fantasy Life i, No Man’s Sky, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Hyrule Warriors

While I wait for the new Hyrule Warriors, I’m looking into games that fit that category but I’m just having second thoughts:
- Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma — I DNF’d 5, and I don’t really enjoy farming
- Cult of the Lamb — I don’t really enjoy roguelites
- DK Bananza — i don’t really enjoy 3d platformers (and the price is too much for me to gamble on)

Need some suggestions regarding buying lipsticks for my wife and sisters. 

So, a bit of backstory: someday last year, during a family outing, I pointed out to my sister that glass and bottle she was carrying, both had her lipstick sticking on it and she'll ultimately end up ingesting a lot of her lipstick (ergo the chemicals). Till that time I had no idea that lipsticks could also be an _expensive_ item because I had never bought any for anyone. Wife and sisters buy their cosmetics themselves. To my observation, they essentially replied that even the Rs.300-400  lipsticks are not generally waterproof and smudge-free (pardon if it is called something else) and they can't afford much pricier ones.
I later saw my wife's lipstick and it was the same brand as that of my sisters' (they probably bought it together) and while she doesn't say anything, I have seen her struggling with lipstick marks on her coffee mug and tshirts but probably doesn't buy a pricier lipstick due to the same reason (my guess).

Now, since Diwali and Bhaidooj are here and I was thinking if I could gift such lipsticks/set of lipsticks to all of them. Please suggest some lipsticks which does not stick to the glass, cups etc, is waterproof and does not smudge easily. Do not much care about the price but would appreciate if it is not too much (I earn decent but absolutely do not have FU type money; can't set a price bar as I don't have any idea of the range of prices).

Please suggest from experience and would be thankful if you can recommend where to buy it from (preferably online, I live in a town).

1o0hjag,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1o0hjag/i_live_in_stardew_valley/,I live in Stardew Valley,"I moved to a little town in the countryside about a year ago when a job came up in the local pub. It occurred to me recently why I absolutely love this place more than anywhere I’ve ever lived and not just because it was an escape from my life after so many things had gone wrong.

I currently live in a flat above the post-office/animal feed/local produce shop run by my landlady who’s very sweet. She puts out a cart with fresh seasonal veggies out front every morning. It’s pumpkins at the moment!

There’s one other shop in town run by a lovely Indian man and his family, they sell all sorts of other groceries and bits, there’s also a supermarket on the outside of town that’s so expensive most people don’t go there (basically JoJa) a tiny little doctors surgery, an animal rescue near the beach and an Italian restaurant that’s really good if a little expensive.

We get a lot of tourists during the summer that come for the beach and many fishing lakes and stay at one of the two campsites either side of town, it really livens up the place having so many people around and many of them come back year after year.

In the winter months our local beach is absolutely overrun with gray seals who come to have their young and you can see hundreds of fluffy baby seals as far as the eye can see!

I work in the local pub and have a group of local regulars who remind me so much of some of the characters from the game. One is a lovely old guy called Dave who’s in the pub every day, mostly for the company but he’s struggled with his health due to cancer and has good days and bad. Almost everyone will buy him a drink but only a few people will sit and talk to him. 
Other locals include the local butcher, a group of old farmers who all turn up at 9:00pm most nights and talk with the heaviest accents you can imagine, all of them lovely guys who enjoy a dirty joke or two!

There’s a mixture of middle aged couples who sometimes bring their kids in, a few who come to play darts, some younger kids (18-20) who don’t drink but come in for a coke and to use the pool table and are always really polite. We have local pool and darts teams, we do karaoke and live music at the weekends and often do charity events like Bingo nights, coffee mornings etc.

Everyone in town knows EVERYONE, I can’t walk down the street without having at least 5 conversations with my neighbours, my parents moved here before me and live a little further out of town but I often hear about them from my neighbours or get asked how they’re doing by others. Sometimes I pop in and have a coffee with them and sometimes they come say hi and spend a few hours in the pub. I almost never finish a shift without being bought a drink!

I could go on and on about the lovely people here, the sweet old lady with her two sausage dogs who remembered my birthday and hand delivered a birthday card for me. The local cab driver who picked me up from the train station for FREE! (He got a few free pints of course!) The lovely family who live next door, the kids who play football over on the playing fields, the old man over the road who’s always out working in his garden in all weather.

Many of them bring in gifts to the pub, fresh fruit and veggies, homemade cakes, homemade cider and pear wine… on Sundays the butcher brings in pork pies and sausage rolls that haven’t sold for us to put out for our customers in exchange for a few beers.

I love walking through the countryside and seeing all the animals in the fields, horses and sheep mostly, you really get a feel for the seasons changing walking through the local forest or watching the combines and tractors bring in their harvest. The summers are warm and the winter’s cold enough we usually get snow.

We have a yearly town fair at the end of summer where everyone makes scarecrows and puts them on display down the street, bunting hanging on every house and people run stalls selling homemade crafts, cakes and other bits and bobs. In the winter the smell of woodsmoke and coal fills the air, being out in the countryside we don’t have gas mains so it’s easier to keep warm with real fires and wrapping up with warm jackets and scarves.

It feels like life should be. I have no idea why I ever wasted so many years living in big towns and cities. Anyway, I just wanted to share, I hope if you can you can bring a little Stardew Valley into your own life and reconnect with your local community, it really does fill the soul!

1o0hcw8,https://i.redd.it/zpv8kwkwfptf1.jpeg,Van Life Coffee Crisis Solved: Ditch the Power-Hungry Machines for Good,"Recently we came across an impressive post：

*“I was wondering what you van dwellers use for coffee makers when using a solar set up. Have any of you found a k-cup ready model that draws less than 850w? I figured your community might be the kings and queens of low draw performance with appliances.”*

This isn’t just a question—it’s a plea for a solution that understands the unique constraints of life on the road. Let’s break down the core problems and troubleshoot them with an OutIn approach.

# Troubleshooting the Classic Van Life Coffee Dilemma

**Problem 1: The Power Hog**

* The Pain: Traditional coffee makers and electric kettles can draw 850W to 1500W. That’s a massive, instantaneous drain on your battery system, often requiring you to fire up a generator or inverter, killing the morning peace.
* The Solution: Eliminate the brewing-time draw entirely. The goal is a device that brews great coffee without being plugged into your 110V/240V system.

**Problem 2: The Quality Compromise**

* The Pain: Low-power solutions often mean instant coffee, or weak, drip-style machines that can’t produce a rich, authentic espresso to kickstart a day of adventure.
* The Solution: A device must deliver café-quality pressure and temperature without needing a café’s power grid.

**Problem 3: Space & Durability**

* The Pain: Van storage is precious. A bulky, fragile machine is a liability on bumpy roads and in cramped quarters.
* The Solution: Compact, all-in-one, and adventure-proof design is non-negotiable.

# The OutIn Mino Fix: Your Portable, Zero-Brewing-Draw Espresso Bar

Meet the troubleshooting toolkit designed for you:

# ⚡ Power Solution: Brew Anywhere, No Outlet Needed

* **Zero Wattage During Brew:** The built-in 9,000mAh battery powers the entire brewing cycle. Your solar system and van battery are untouched while you make coffee.
* **Solar-Friendly Charging:** Replenish the battery efficiently via USB-C PD (using a power bank, your van's USB port, or a solar generator). It charges from 20% to 80% in just 45 minutes—often faster than your morning solar intake.
* **Extended Utility:** One full charge isn’t just for coffee; it can brew up to 6 espresso shots (with cold water) or act as a 500-cup hot water source for tea, oatmeal, or dehydrated meals.

# ☕ Quality Solution: Real Espresso, No Compromises

* **Authentic Pressure & Heat:** With 22 BAR pressure and a stable 93.3°C brewing temperature, OutIn produces espresso with a rich, golden crema that rivals any stationary machine.
* **Dual Brewing Flexibility:** Use your favorite 10-12g of ground coffee or a Nespresso Original pod. You’re not locked into one type of coffee.

# 🧰 Durability & Space Solution: Built for the Road

* **True Compactness:** Measuring just 67mm × 195mm, it tucks away in a drawer or cup holder, claiming minimal space.
* **Adventure-Ready Specs:** With an IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, you don’t need to worry about rain, sand, or dust. The anti-slip grip ensures stability on your counter, even on an incline.
* **Extreme Environment Proven:** It performs smoothly at altitudes up to 5,000m and in temperatures from -15°C to 45°C. (Pro-tip: In sub-zero conditions, store it indoors overnight for optimal battery performance).

**The Verdict for Van Life:**You no longer have to choose between preserving battery power and enjoying a premium coffee experience. The OutIn system is designed to integrate seamlessly into your mobile, solar-powered lifestyle, turning any scenic overlook into your personal café.

1o0hcqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1o0hcqk/scary_london_university_dorm/,Scary London university dorm,"The memory of moisture

Intro

I can’t tell you the name of the university.
If I did, anyone in Britain would know at once.
Let’s just say it’s one of those very famous institutions in central London — not far from Euston Station.

When I flew back to London from home in the summer of 2024, the sky hung low and heavy. Flights from China usually land either before dawn or in the late afternoon; I always choose the latter, so by the time I arrive, all I have to do is fall into bed and let sleep drag my body clock across time zones.

Dragging my suitcase from the station, I saw at the corner a grey-brick dormitory with narrow, old windows — Campbell House, let’s call it. Under the dull daylight it looked almost funereal.

At reception, the manager smiled and handed me my key.

“Room 02. Basement. Very quiet.”

The corridor below was dim, the lights sickly yellow. My room lay at the far end. When I opened the door, the air hit me — cold, damp, the way an Underground tunnel smells after rain. I’d been abroad long enough not to flinch.

Still, the layout felt wrong. The ceiling was low; a thick grey pipe ran down one wall, trembling faintly. Later the caretaker explained that it carried waste from the toilets upstairs.

That night, I fell asleep to its rhythm — glug, glug, like someone pacing above my bed.
When I woke, a chill had settled beside my pillow.
Old building, I told myself. You’ll get used to it.

⸻

The First Message

In the first week of my final year, my desk disappeared beneath dissertation notes. Sleep came later and later. Since moving into that room, a strange heaviness had crept over me, as if the air itself pressed against my chest.

One Friday night, as I sat staring at my laptop, an email arrived:

From: rory.mason.22@xxx
To: Room 02
Is it still leaking?

I read the line again and again. The address was a student one, but I didn’t know anyone by that name.

The next morning, I asked at reception. The manager flipped through her records.

“Rory Mason? Scottish boy. Heavy accent. Lived in 02 three years ago. The leak was terrible that year — he moved out.”
“And his school email still works?”
She frowned.
“No. He graduated. It should’ve been deactivated.”

The words made my skin prickle. But strange things always beg for ordinary explanations. Maybe a system glitch, I thought, or one of those endless spam messages the university servers churn out.

That night, though, the sound above my ceiling grew louder — not dripping now, but slow, deliberate footsteps.

A repairman came the next morning, called by someone else on the floor.
He was red-haired, blue-eyed, his badge marked R.M.
He unfolded a ladder, twisted a valve, and said almost kindly,

“Old problem. The water in this building always finds its old paths.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.
He smiled.

“Moisture has a memory.”

The phrase clung to me like fog.

That night, the noise stopped — for a while.

⸻

The Girl in the Pub

By October I couldn’t bear the basement air any longer. One rainy evening I wandered out and ducked into a pub.

The room was warm, smelling of malt and damp wool. As I sat down, a voice beside me said,

“You look like someone who’s just come up from underground.”

A young woman — pale skin, red hair, blue eyes — watched me with a calm half-smile.
In that instant, I thought not of her beauty, but of the maintenance man.

“You’ve got dust on your sleeve,” she said.
“Basement room,” I explained.
“I know that smell.”
She extended her hand.

“Rory Mason.”

My pulse jumped. The name — the same name.

She said she studied psychology at my university. We talked about weather, classes, nothing of consequence. She spoke slowly, smiled rarely, but her presence was strangely soothing, like the first mild breeze of spring brushing the old stone walls.

As we parted, she said,

“Let’s have tea sometime.”

We exchanged numbers.

That night, a text from her lit my phone:

“Don’t keep the light on too late.”

The words stirred something uneasy in me — the name, the initials, the email. I deleted what I meant to ask and wrote back only:

“Okay.”

⸻

Echoes

We met often after that — on the library stairs, in small cafés by the windows. She drank unsweetened black tea; I took coffee. Our conversations were light, but beneath them ran a rhythm — as if we were both keeping time with something old and slow.

Once, I complained about the noise in my ceiling.
She lowered her cup.

“Old houses walk the same paths. The sounds just go back to where they began.”
“How do you know that?”
“I heard it once,” she said after a pause. “A friend told me.”

The phrasing, the tone — they were his. The maintenance man’s.

That March, R.M. appeared again with his toolbox.

“Sometimes tightening things makes them louder,” he said. “Let them find their own way.”
“Are you also called Rory Mason?” I asked.
He laughed softly.
“Common name in Scotland.”

After that, I could no longer tell them apart — the man and the woman. They spoke with the same breath.

⸻

The Father

In spring, she invited me for tea.
The sunlight pooled on her hair, copper bright.
I asked, carefully,

“Do you know someone named Rory Mason?”

Her fingers paused on her cup.

“That’s a common name,” she said lightly, and changed the subject.

When the bill came, she scribbled her email on a napkin.

“Send me your dissertation draft,” she said. “I can check your grammar.”

But when I looked at it, I froze — Rorry Mason, with an extra r.

Relief washed over me. Same sound, different name. Coincidence.
“You always spell it like that?”

“Always,” she smiled. “You must’ve heard wrong.”

Outside, she spoke of her father — an artist, she said, who stayed home and disliked visitors.

“Maybe I’ll walk you home someday.”
“If you’re not afraid of him,” she laughed.

I thought spring had finally come.

⸻

The Visit

A week later, after a late movie, I did walk her home.
Her building stood near Russell Square — red brick, stairwell creaking.
At her door she turned and said,

“It’s a bit messy, but come in if you like.”

Inside, everything was immaculate.
While she poured water in the kitchen, I looked around: dark abstract paintings, neatly stacked cups, books aligned like soldiers.
On the desk, a closed laptop — a white label on its back: Rory Mason.
The same on a notebook beside it.

The relief I’d felt in the café evaporated. The name — identical to that first email.
But wasn’t that account supposed to belong to a male student long graduated?

I bent closer to read.
From the kitchen came her voice:

“Milk or no milk?”
“No, thanks.”

She returned with two cups of tea.

“Didn’t you say you spell your name with two r’s? Why does this one have one?”
She hesitated, set the cup precisely on its coaster.
“Old things,” she said. “My father made those labels. He likes spelling it that way.”

Before I could reply, a man’s voice came from the next room — low, northern, and horribly familiar.

“Add more water when you make the tea.”

The Scottish accent. The same tone that had once murmured, Don’t keep the lights on too late.

I started up, but she caught my hand — smiling still, though her grip was firm.

“Don’t go in,” she said. “He doesn’t like being disturbed.”
“Your father?”
“Mm. He’s… a peculiar man.”

Again the voice:

“Is the water boiling yet?”

Ice crept down my spine.
She released me, calm again.

“Drink your tea. He’ll be quiet soon.”

We never mentioned the name again.
I finished my tea, made an excuse, and left.

Walking back through the drizzle, one thought circled in my head:
If she was Rorry, then who was Rory?
And if she wasn’t — what was she hiding?

⸻

The Departure

Weeks later she called.

“I’m transferring to Edinburgh,” she said.
“When?”
“Next month.”
“Good luck.”

A pause.

“Thank you for talking with me.”

The next day, an email arrived:

I’m moving to Edinburgh next month.
— Rorry

I stared at that extra letter for a long time.
Everything clicked — the names, the voice, the pipes.
I never wrote back.

⸻

The Last Day

June 18th, 2025 — the final day before graduation.
I packed my suitcase. The corridor outside was unnervingly quiet.

Then came a knock.
R.M. stood there with his toolbox.

“Leaving today?”
“Yeah.”

He stepped in, turned a valve. The pipe sighed softly.

“Should stay quiet for a while,” he said, smiling faintly. “Old places have good memories.”

The words chilled me — as if he were speaking to something alive.

At reception I returned my key.

“All settled?” the manager asked.
“Yes.” I hesitated. “That repairman — R.M. — does he have any family?”
She looked surprised.
“Him? Not that I know of. Been here over ten years, always alone. No visitors.”
She smiled.
“Bit of a loner. Fixes leaks for us, no one else hires him.”

She added, almost absently,

“We’ve got his records — passport, everything.”

I nodded and left, but questions thudded in my chest like the pipes overhead.

Outside, June sunlight poured down, the air warm and clean.
I remembered what Rorry had said:

“Old houses walk the same paths.”

Maybe people do, too.

Since she left for Scotland, I’ve never heard from her again.
The other day I passed Campbell House and saw new students hauling their suitcases in, laughing.

I couldn’t help wondering if any of them would end up in Basement Room 02 —

NHL is back, friends! I couldn’t be more excited. Tonight, I fully expect the Panthers to pile on the goals at home. Florida has put at least 4 on the board in 7 of their last 10 meetings with the Blackhawks, and 5 of their last 6 meetings have seen the two squads bag a total of at least 6 goals. My money’s on the Over to hit.

My shelves are stacked with books and manga, my playlists jump from My Chemical Romance to All Time Low, and somewhere between those lyrics and stories, I found peace in being on my own.

A little chubby, a little cheeky, glasses always slipping down while I laugh at my own jokes. I live solo, surrounded by books, anime, and late-night walks that feel like movie scenes. I’m independent, grounded, and maybe a bit too sentimental about fictional characters and coffee shop ambience.

I love deep conversations, the kind that start with “What’s your favorite anime?” and end with “What do you think is the true meaning of happiness ?” 
I believe in soft loyalty, quiet strength, and laughter that feels like home.

The other day, I took a half day for a high school teacher of the same subject I am getting my licensure in. I came in around noon, so the classroom lights were on and the students were at lunch. There was a backpack right at the feet of the chair/desk where I'd be sitting as well as 3 coffee tumblers/water bottles sitting right where my notebook/computer would be (if the instructions are a workday, I typically bring my computer to study for my exams when there is downtime). So, I figured the teacher might be making copies and coming back to grab her bag and cups. Nope. Never showed.

The cups/straws had dried lipstick stains on them and old, chunky coffee in the bottom. I couldn't even clearly find my sub plans...or at least I was doubtful that they were my sub plans because of how many papers were on the desk and I had no roster for students (this isn't the first time I've been left with no roster...I usually ask the students if it looks like any of their classmates are missing).

I opened just the top, center drawer to look for a sticky note a student asked me for and the drawer was jammed. Then, I tried the next one, and the next one. All jammed and full of stuff. There were bags on the floor behind me...claw clips and hair ties underneath the desk at my feet. There was a Bath and Body Works wallflower plugged in right next to the desk. I couldn't even breathe, it was making me nauseous and I had to unplug it.

I try not to touch any of the teacher's personal belongings when I sub and I always am certain to put everything back exactly where I found it...but I had to move her water bottles so I could have room for my elbows, unplug her wallflower because it was making me sick, and move her bags so that I could sit down.

And the thing is, I have subbed at this school a few times before and I love the students and the district (though, I have never met this teacher before).

AITAH for thinking that this is rude and disrespectful? I have teacher friends who were baffled when I told them about this classroom and they expressed to me that, even though they aren't Type A super organized, they at least clear their desk when they know they have a sub coming.",3,1759849278.0,SubstituteTeachers,5,0.8,False

	•	Stimulant culture: It’s one of the world’s oldest psychoactive commodities—used to wake soldiers, fuel factory work, and keep societies productive. It’s a drug that got turned into a social ritual, so it has that mix of comfort and control.

A dozen childhood friends who once drank, used drugs and engaged in 'disgusting behaviour' while under the influence are set to open a new lounge in Birmingham's coolest neighbourhood where visitors can use medicinal cannabis 'without stigma'.

Article continues below

Grams is set to open on November 1, a lounge with Luke Littler dartboards, a slick pool table, a stage for live performances, games, food, coffee and equipment that allows those with prescriptions to use their cannabis medication.

The members lounge, at the Wharfside Leisure Complex on Lifford Lane, will be a 'sanctuary for holistic healing and cannabis-based wellness' when it opens, with support staff and signposting for those who may be struggling with drug and alcohol addictions while also acting as a 'chill' venue in which to build community.

Membership is priced from £10 a month and there will be no cannabis on sale. Cannabis is a controlled drug and visitors will be screened for prescriptions prior to entry and must consume via vaping methods if they intend to medicate on the premises.

Combusting cannabis, such as smoking it, will not be permitted, with staff on hand for guidance. The venue has an extractor system to freshen the air and vaping equipment available for legal consumption of the medicine.

# The law on medicinal cannabis

Cannabis is controlled as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

It's illegal to possess, produce, supply, import or export cannabis in the UK.

In November 2018, regulations were updated to allow cannabis-based medicines to be prescribed to patients by specialist doctors.



The 12 owners of Grams are former childhood friends who reconnected in their 30s through work. Among them, Jamie Green, 41, who works at a mechanical electrical company.

He says: ""We all grew up together and we all had alcohol and cocaine addiction issues. It was what we did, it was a lifestyle.

""But now we're in recovery. We stopped drinking and sessioning and realised there wasn't anything to do. We couldn't go to the pub any more, but we didn't have any other hobbies because we'd always been out on the smash. It's all we ever did.

""Grams is for people like us, who don't go to the pub any more and who do use medical cannabis, where they won't get judged if they show up stinking of weed.

""I had been self-medicating for ADHD since I was 13 and it's only now I'm old enough I realised that I'd been self-medicating to quiet my 9,000 thoughts a second. It quietens it down for me.

""Then I'd been taking opiates every day for a burst disc in my back, but found that medical cannabis stopped me needing to take 25-30 tablets a day. Now I don't use opioids any more.

""Cannabis is a medicine, everybody that uses it is probably using it for a medicinal reason, to relax or to calm their head.""

Co-owner Nick Joesbury, 39, added: ""First and foremost, we're a harm reduction centre. The medical cannabis thing is part of that, but it's only for people with prescriptions.

""We're creating a space for people whether they medicate or not. It just looks like this because it's our style.""

He's referring to the decor, featuring rappers, a Cheech and Chong-style mural resembling Nintendo characters with the slogan 'Super Stoned Bros' and even a chess board with cannabis leaf pawns and a variety of bongs as the other game pieces.

Another of the owners, Danny Strachan, 40, said: ""You can use cannabis but it's not like some Amsterdam cafe. It's not legal to sell weed in England, it's nothing like that.

""It looks like one, but it's just medicinal cannabis, where people can use their medication with a vaporiser.

""People have a skewed view of cannabis sometimes and they might not understand what we're trying to achieve. People were assuming we were opening a shop where you'd smoke weed with people hanging around outside, but it's not that.

""We're checking prescriptions, you have to sign up to access the lounge with all your ID and paperwork which we review every three months. It's regulated.""

That means no 'spliffs' or use of illegally-obtained drugs, no controlled substances on sale, only prescribed medicine in an 18+ facility with a strict locked-door policy to non-members and children.

The door is open, however, to discussion as they prepare for launch.

Danny said: ""We've got an open-door policy for anyone with concerns, and we've been fully open to the neighbours, to police and local councillors. We're welcoming guys, open to conversation, and we want to break down the stigma.""

Craig Grunerovergaard, 37, explained how he'd been in recovery from addition after 'not being able to remember most of his life'. He's found empowerment and support from his new business partners while creating Grams.

He said: ""Jamie and the lads had been talking about opening a place like this for years but through work, we all came together.

""It feels like fate, we all started working together and it facilitated us financially as well as everything else to make this happen. We built these walls! Everything.

""We'd never done anything like this before, but it's a place we can come together to help people find a better way of living, off the drink and drugs.""

Now the men are planning yoga, meditation and more wellness activities, canal clean-ups, a gym, as well as wild camping trips, walking and biking events and support groups organised through their community interest company.

Danny said: ""What we're doing is offering a space with opportunities for a better life. It's not just a social environment, we're going to be bettering people's lives, whether it's with diet, with some of the natural product we'll be selling or just through changing perceptions on how you can live and what you can do.

""As lads you get mixed up in this idea that it's cool to be out on the sesh for days, but it's not. The best things I enjoy now are being in nature with the dog, having a granddaughter, having peace.""

Craig added: ""In a world of chaos and divide, we're trying to find unity. We got 12 of us together and look what we've done in eight months?

""The last time we were together as a group were as kids. Now we're back together as men. Over the years we built masks with drink and drugs. Now we're recovering, talking, understanding and moving on from it.""

Nick added: ""Our main objective is that we want to change lives, to help people be healthier.

""When you're living that way, and your head is in a bad way, you don't realise it and it's a vicious cycle that's hard to break. We'd be out for three days at a time, up to some disgusting behaviour, but we'd all be doing it so we thought it was all alright. You keep doing it.

""Now we know if you've got the right support around you, you can break out of the cycle. It doesn't have to be lonely, or isolating, you can be with people that are on the same journey as you, getting advice.""

To get Grams membership, you don't have to be a cannabis user, though if you do wish to consume the controlled drug on the premises you have to register via their website ahead of time.

Once open, there are comedy shows and music nights planned. There are also interactive dart boards available for private hire, a studio for young adults to record music in, games, a pool table and classic dart boards.

Rent was overdue, the eviction notice was taped to my door like a scarlet letter, and my fridge held nothing but half a bottle of ketchup and a takeout container I was too afraid to open. I’d stopped answering calls weeks ago, there were only so many ways to say “I’ll pay you next Friday” when Friday had stopped showing up for you.

Every night I sat in front of my laptop until my eyes burned, scrolling through job sites that blurred together into one long rejection letter. Experience required. Degree preferred. Must be willing to smile while dying inside.

No one hires someone whose only résumé entry is “desperate.”

That’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t even online. I was walking home from the grocery store, empty-handed because even ramen felt like a luxury, and I noticed a flyer taped to the bus stop shelter. It was printed on plain white paper, the kind you’d pull from a dusty office printer.

Black letters. No logo. No company name.

SELL YOUR TIME.

Competitive rates. No experience necessary.

I laughed. Out loud, to no one.

A scam, obviously. Some shady gig that ends with your kidneys on the dark web. But the thing stuck in my head the entire walk home, like an earworm. Sell your time. The words were too simple, too confident, like whoever wrote them didn’t care if you believed or not.

By the time I reached my apartment, curiosity had started wrestling with hopelessness. What if it wasn’t a scam? What if it was just weird? Weird was better than starving.

The email was printed in tiny letters at the bottom of the page. I typed it in, hit send, and told myself it was just a joke.

They replied before I even finished making coffee.

The message was short.

Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp.

Orientation available tomorrow, 9:00 AM. No documentation required.

Please arrive on time.

No address signature, no phone number. Just a street name I’d never heard of and those last two words — on time.

The next morning, I went. I don’t even remember deciding to. I just remember standing in front of a building that looked too clean to exist in my part of town.

ChronoCorp.

The name was printed in thin silver letters above the glass doors. No slogan, no logo. Inside, the air smelled like nothing, the sterile, filtered kind of nothing that only money can afford. Everything gleamed white: the floors, the walls, even the furniture. The only color came from the clocks.

There were so many clocks.

Dozens of them lined the walls, each one a little different, antique brass, digital displays, wristwatches in glass cases, but all ticking in perfect, synchronized rhythm. Not a single second out of place.

The sound was hypnotic. Soft but endless.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

The receptionist sat behind a white counter that looked like it had never known dust. Her hair was neatly pinned back, her uniform spotless, her expression... off. Like a smile worn thin from too much practice.

“Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp,” she said, every syllable smooth and balanced. “We value every second.”

I told her I didn’t have a résumé. She didn’t blink.

“We won’t need that.”

She slid a clipboard toward me. The paper was thick and heavy, the kind you’d use for wedding invitations.

It wasn’t a job application. There was no section for previous employment or emergency contact. Just a handful of lines filled with legal jargon that might as well have been written in another language.

The only part in bold, centered in the middle of the page, read:

TIME EXCHANGED.

There was a line for a signature underneath.

I hesitated, glancing up to ask a question, but the receptionist wasn’t looking at me anymore.

Her gaze was fixed on the largest clock on the wall, a massive black-and-gold thing that ticked with mechanical precision.

For a moment, I thought the sound of it got louder. Like the air itself was keeping time.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

“Do I need to…?” I started, but she cut me off gently.

“Just sign, and we’ll take care of the rest.”

Her tone was kind. Too kind. Like someone comforting a child before a vaccination.

My stomach twisted, but the word “paycheck” echoed in my head louder than the ticking.

I signed.

She smiled, not warmly, but with a kind of satisfaction that made my chest tighten. Then she reached for a small silver stopwatch on the counter, pressed it once, and said softly:

“Your time begins now.”

The ticking in the room seemed to falter for a single beat.

Just one.

Then everything went perfectly, eerily back to rhythm.

The job turned out to be… easy.

Too easy.

A man in a gray suit met me in the lobby the next morning. He didn’t smile, didn’t introduce himself, just turned on his heel and motioned for me to follow. His shoes made no sound on the tile. Mine did. That was the first thing that felt wrong: it was like the building only chose to echo for me.

The hallways stretched longer than they should have. Clean. Too clean. White walls, chrome trim, soft white lights that never flickered, and clocks, everywhere. Wall clocks, desk clocks, floor clocks, all ticking together in a perfect synchronized rhythm. The sound should have been comforting, but it wasn’t. It reminded me of breathing—one, two, three—and I couldn’t tell if it was mine or the building’s.

We passed door after door, each labeled Donation Room followed by a number. I tried to count them, but somewhere between 6 and 9, I lost track. The numbers didn’t make sense. We turned corners that didn’t seem to exist in the building’s floor plan I’d seen online.

Finally, he stopped at Donation Room 7. The door opened with a soft click, and he motioned me inside.

The room was small, barely big enough for the chair in the center and the machine beside it. The machine looked old, older than the building itself. Heavy brass panels, faint scratches on its surface, the kind of hum you feel more than hear. Wires coiled out from its sides like veins, ending in silver discs the size of coins. A dial on the front read:

Hours Donated: 0.00.

“Please sit,” the man said. His voice was quiet, smooth, practiced.

I obeyed, mostly out of habit, out of hunger.

The discs against my temples were cold enough to make me flinch. The metal smelled faintly like ozone, like lightning before a storm.

“You may feel a brief acceleration,” he said. “That’s normal.”

Acceleration. I opened my mouth to ask what that meant, but before I could speak, the hum deepened. It wasn’t loud, more like a pressure behind my eyes. My heartbeat started matching it. Or maybe it was the other way around.

Then it stopped.

The man was already removing the discs. His movements were calm, deliberate, unbothered.

The wall clock said an hour had passed. My phone said the same. But I hadn’t felt it. Not a second of it. My body felt rested, lighter, like I’d been asleep but better. My hunger was gone, replaced by this strange clarity—like my brain had been polished.

The man handed me a slip of paper. $480.

“Payment is automatic,” he said. “You’ll receive it instantly.”

He was right. By the time I checked my phone, the deposit was already there. No delay, no pending transaction. Just, done.

The second session went the same. So did the third.

Each visit, I’d sit, feel the hum, blink, and time would vanish. No dizziness. No side effects. Just missing hours and a bigger balance in my account.

Other employees drifted through the hallways like ghosts in pressed uniforms. They didn’t talk much. They didn’t look much either. Sometimes I’d pass someone I swore I’d seen before, only their face would seem slightly off. Not in a big way, just subtly rearranged, like they were the same person but through a fogged mirror.

Once, I stopped by the vending machine on my way out and saw a woman staring at it, hand hovering over the keypad, motionless. Her reflection in the metal looked sharper than her actual face.

“What does it do?” I asked, nodding toward her door.

She blinked slowly, then smiled without looking up. “Don’t overthink it,” she said. “Just enjoy the paychecks.”

And I did.

The money felt unreal at first, too much, too easy, but after a few sessions, I stopped questioning it. Bills disappeared. The fridge filled up. I bought a new mattress, decent headphones, even a proper coat for the first time in years. I slept through the night without the usual dread gnawing at me.

For a while, it felt like maybe this was what stability looked like.

But little things started bothering me.

The clocks, for one. They ticked in perfect unison, at work, at home, even on my phone. I’d lie in bed sometimes and hear it under the silence, soft, steady, everywhere.

And the seconds. They’d skip.

Not randomly, but rhythmically, like something was cutting out the empty space between ticks. Sometimes my phone would jump from 10:42:06 to 10:42:08, cleanly, like the world had blinked and moved on without me.

I told myself it was nothing. Just a glitch.

But some mornings I’d wake up and my phone’s alarm would already be ringing, even though I hadn’t set it. I’d check the call log and see a number labeled “ChronoCorp HQ,” listed at times I didn’t remember being awake.

And every night, just before I drifted off, I’d feel that faint hum behind my temples again.

It wasn’t loud enough to scare me.

Just loud enough to remind me it was still there.

Counting.

The first thing I lost was a meal.

Nothing major. Just dinner.

I came home one night, dropped my keys on the counter, and saw an empty plate in the sink. Grease streaks. Crumbs. A fork balanced across it. Only, I hadn’t cooked. I hadn’t eaten.

I stood there staring at the plate longer than I care to admit, waiting for some memory to click into place. It didn’t. The smell of garlic still lingered in the air, faint but fresh.

I checked my phone.

A text from my friend Mia: “That pasta was good. You should cook more often.”

My thumb hovered over the screen. I hadn’t seen her in weeks.

I started to type back, something like What pasta?, but before I finished, the typing bubbles appeared on her end. Then froze. Then disappeared. The timestamp on her message read “Yesterday.”

I stared at that word until the phone went dark.

After that, it wasn’t just dinner.

I’d open my fridge and find groceries I didn’t remember buying, fresh fruit, cold cuts, a bottle of wine that definitely hadn’t been there the day before. Once I found a grocery receipt in my jacket pocket, signed in my handwriting, with a timestamp for 2:13 a.m.

Sometimes I’d wake up and my laundry was folded neatly in the basket. Once, my sheets were changed. I don’t even own spare sheets.

For a while, I blamed stress. Or maybe the sessions at ChronoCorp were messing with my sleep schedule. Maybe “donating hours” confused my body clock. It was the only explanation that didn’t make me sound insane.

But it wasn’t just me.

One morning, the clocks in my apartment stopped. Every single one, digital, analog, wall, phone, for exactly one second.

Then, without a sound, they all caught up in perfect unison.

I stood there holding my breath, listening to the faint tick that seemed to crawl under everything. The fridge hum, the traffic outside, even my heartbeat, everything was syncing to that rhythm.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be. It was constant.

Then came the bruises.

Small, circular ones on my arms and neck. Not painful, just there. The size of a coin. I tried to remember bumping into something, but the harder I tried, the more my memories slipped away like water between fingers.

Some mornings, there’d be new marks. Faint scratches along my ribs. Little red indentations on my temples where the discs used to sit.

At work, no one mentioned them. The man in the gray suit still met me in the lobby, still walked me wordlessly to Donation Room 7.

Same chair. Same hum. Same slip of paper with a new number.

Only the machine was different this time.

The dial didn’t start at zero.

It already read 3.00 when I sat down.

I frowned. “Why does it say that?”

The man’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes seemed… distant, like he was reading off a script written behind my head.

“It accounts for carryover,” he said.

“Carryover of what?”

He smiled. It was the kind of smile people practice in mirrors, all muscle, no meaning.

“Time isn’t lost,” he said softly. “It’s redistributed.”

Before I could respond, the hum began.

This time, I felt it deeper. Not in my head, in my bones. The air thickened. My vision tunneled.

When it stopped, I didn’t feel lighter.

I felt stretched.

Like part of me hadn’t caught up yet. Like I’d stood up too fast and left something behind.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The hum seemed to follow me home, whispering in the stillness. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw numbers flickering behind my eyelids—3.00, 4.25, 6.00—like my dreams were clocking in.

The next morning, Mia called me.

I almost didn’t answer. When I finally did, her voice was trembling.

“Hey,” she said. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Why?”

“You don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

Silence. Long, unsteady. Then:

“You were at my place last night. You brought wine. You told me you quit your job.”

My chest went tight. “No, I didn’t.”

Her breath hitched. “You did. You were different. You looked… happy. But your eyes…”

“What about them?”

Another pause. Then, quietly:

“They weren’t yours.”

I didn’t know what to say. I think I hung up without meaning to.

That night, I didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. The hum was louder now, steady, pulsing behind my eyes like a second heartbeat. The clocks in my room ticked out of sync for the first time since I’d started at ChronoCorp.

Then, one by one, they corrected themselves.

Except my wristwatch.

It was still ticking a second too fast.

When I tried to reset it, the second hand pushed back.

Not jammed. Not broken.

Pushing back.

Like something inside was fighting to keep going.

I stopped going in for a week.

No calls. No emails. No one from ChronoCorp showed up at my door.

At first, I thought maybe they’d forgotten about me. Then the direct deposits kept coming.

Every Friday. Same time. Same amount.

Even though I hadn’t clocked in.

That’s what broke me.

It wasn’t guilt. It was curiosity.

If they didn’t need me to show up, then where the hell was my time coming from?

I decided to go back, not to work, but to find out who was signing my life away.

ChronoCorp’s lobby looked different that morning.

Brighter somehow. Polished. The walls gleamed with that false, hospital-white sheen that only fluorescent light can make. The air was sterile, humming softly with the sound of electricity, or maybe time itself.

And the clocks.

They were everywhere.

But this time, every single one showed the same thing: 12:00.

Hundreds of them, ticking in unison, yet somehow perfectly silent.

The receptionist smiled when she saw me.

“Mr. Hale,” she said, her voice syrup-smooth.

I froze.

“My name isn’t—”

She tilted her head, still smiling.

“It will be.”

She slid a visitor badge across the desk. I looked down.

It didn’t say Visitor.

It said:

DONOR 27 — EXPIRED ACCESS.

Something inside me twisted.

I didn’t correct her. I just took the badge and walked past before she could stop me.

The hallways were quieter than usual, but I could feel movement through the walls—machines breathing, wires pulsing. The floors vibrated faintly under my shoes, like the building had a heartbeat.

I passed room after room, glass walls revealing rows of people slumped in the same reclining chairs I’d used. Discs on their temples. The machines beside them pulsed with faint blue light.

Most were motionless. Some twitched.

Their eyes fluttered beneath closed lids, as if they were dreaming someone else’s dream.

I reached the end of the corridor.

A locked glass door read:

CLIENT ACCESS — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

I swiped my badge, just to try.

The lock clicked open.

Inside was colder. The temperature dropped a few degrees instantly, and my breath fogged the glass.

Rows of monitors filled the room—hundreds of screens showing live feeds of people. All ordinary moments: a man eating dinner, a woman brushing her hair, a child playing with a dog. All of them… happy.

None of them noticed the cameras.

Then one screen caught my eye.

The feed showed me.

I was in a restaurant I didn’t recognize, wearing a suit I didn’t own, drinking wine I couldn’t afford. Across from me sat a woman, older, elegant, poised in a way money teaches. She was smiling, calm, as if she’d known me forever.

A label flashed at the corner of the feed:

CLIENT: ADELA HALE

PURCHASED HOURS: 268.

268 hours.

Eleven days.

That’s how much of me she owned.

I clicked into the file.

Notes appeared:

Excellent physical compatibility. Responsive body control. Requests recurring sessions.

Remaining balance: 2 years, 11 months, 4 days.

My mouth went dry.

I hadn’t sold that much.

“ You’re not supposed to be here.”

The voice came from behind me.

The man in the gray suit. Same one from the first day. Only now, his face looked thinner—like someone had scraped the human off him and left something hollow underneath.

“She likes your body,” he said, calm as ever. “Says it’s easy to move in.”

I turned on him. “I didn’t agree to this.”

He shrugged, almost kindly. “You signed the contract. You didn’t specify the limit. That’s what happens when you sell time in bulk.”

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Then I want it back.”

He tilted his head, watching me the way a clock might watch a second hand.

“You can’t take back what’s already spent.”

My hands shook. I grabbed the monitor, yanking it sideways. “Where is she?”

He looked up, eyes flicking toward the clock above the door.

“Not here,” he said. “She’s in there.”

The clock read 12:00.

It didn’t move.

Then something cracked inside my skull, like the sound of glass shattering underwater.

The air folded inward.

I was standing in the restaurant.

Same table. Same wine.

Adela Hale sat across from me, smiling my own smile.

“Hello, darling,” she said.

And it was my voice.

I stumbled back. “Get out of me.”

She chuckled softly. “You gave me this. You didn’t want the time. I simply made better use of it.”

The restaurant froze mid-motion, waiters paused mid-step, wine mid-pour, laughter suspended in the air like a photo.

The light flickered, but it wasn’t dimming. It was hesitating.

When I looked down, my hands weren’t syncing.

One lagged behind the other, like my body couldn’t decide what second it belonged to.

She stood, lifting her glass with perfect grace.

“You shouldn’t have come back,” she said. “You’re making a mess of the schedule.”

The walls bent inward. The air shimmered, bending sound and shape together.

I could hear the hum again, the same low vibration from the Donation Room, only now it filled every inch of me. My bones vibrated with it.

“Stop,” I whispered.

She smiled wider. “It’s already stopped.”

And she was right.

Everything was motionless except her, and me.

Then I realized she wasn’t really moving either.

She was replaying seconds ahead of me, like I was watching her future through a glass wall I couldn’t reach.

“Time,” she whispered, her voice overlapping itself like echoes in a tunnel,

“doesn’t belong to anyone. It just waits for someone desperate enough to sell it.”

I blinked, and she was gone.

So was the restaurant.

I was back in Donation Room 7.

Empty chair. Cold air. The hum fading into silence.

Only the clock on the wall remained.

Still ticking—one second too fast.

I reached for it, desperate to stop the sound, to prove I still existed.

My hand passed straight through.

The hum cut out.

Everything stopped.

For a heartbeat, I thought that was peace.

Then I realized it wasn’t silence.

It was the sound of something waiting to start again.

I woke up to the hum again.

Familiar, but distant.

Not my own heartbeat this time, it was someone else’s, pulsing inside me in a rhythm I couldn’t claim.

The chair beneath me was cold. Donation Room 7. Same walls. Same ceiling. Same hum trembling faintly through the air like a held breath, like the room itself was waiting for me to remember.

A slip of paper lay on the counter.

My handwriting. Only the number was different.

$1,200.

I didn’t remember doing it.

The receptionist smiled when I stumbled out. Perfect. Practiced. Empty, like her face was drawn onto glass.

“Thank you for your service,” she said.

“I… I don’t—”

My voice cracked. The words felt foreign, like I was trying to speak through static, like someone else was borrowing my mouth to answer for me.

Her eyes flicked toward the clock above the door. It wasn’t ticking. Or maybe it was, but the seconds weren’t mine anymore.

“Your time begins now,” she whispered.

I turned toward the mirror.

It wasn’t me.

Not entirely.

The face staring back belonged to someone else, wearing my eyes like borrowed glass. My hair, my skin, my hands… but hollow. A mask I had worn for someone else’s comfort. Its smile twitched half a beat too late.

The hum grew louder. Not just the machine. The walls. The air. The space between my ribs. Every breath vibrated like it was running on borrowed seconds. Every heartbeat felt leased, out of sync with my chest.

I tried to speak. My mouth moved. The words weren’t mine.

I tried to move. My body responded halfway, awkwardly, uncertainly. A marionette with tangled strings, limbs jerking just off‑time.

Then the screen in front of me flickered on.

Another me appeared, sitting in an office I didn’t recognize, smiling at a client I didn’t know.

Hours I’d never lived. Memories I’d never made.

Playing back in real time like a recording, except the recording was my body.

In one feed I was laughing; in another I was crying. In one I was holding a child. In another, a knife.

All of it me.

None of it mine.

I realized with a sick clarity:

I wasn’t gone. Not yet. But I was someone else’s property now.

The receptionist reached for the stopwatch.

Pressed it once.

“Your hour has been sold,” she said softly. “Enjoy the rest of your life… if you can call it that.”

The world wavered.

The hum became a single, stretched note that filled everything.

Every second I’d counted as mine slipped through my fingers like sand, leaving only the rhythm of something still ticking, somewhere far away.

I tried to scream. The sound that came out was mine—and yet not.

I tried to remember who I was. Nothing. Just a lingering echo of borrowed time.

Then nothing.

No pain. No sound. Just a faint, eternal ticking, waiting for the next desperate soul.

I thought: Maybe this is what eternity feels like.

I recently visited her home town and we met up for a coffee to catch up.

We have always had a good relationship, even if we don't talk all that often. However her whole side of the family has become more and more right leaning and last time I saw them we got into a heated political discussion and I was shocked to find out they are not only Trump supporters but are even supporting Putin and his war.

This time around, I deliberately tried to avoid politics. But of course she still had to gush about how much she looks up to Trump and referring to him as her idol.

I thought I could keep our relationship free of politics, but I don't think I can keep up the contact with a clear conscience any more, knowing she is supporting political leaders that are actively and openly working to dismantle democracy and free speech. 

So I have come to realize if I am going to be able to keep an open contact with her and her side of the family, I need to confront her about her political beliefs and ask for clarification of her views and values.

I have always looked up to my aunt and my impression of her has been that she is a kind, caring and intelligent person. Therefore I can only conclude that she is not, in my opinion, aware of the true nature of Trump and his agenda, and that she has fallen victim to right wing propaganda and potentially being stuck in an ""echo chamber"". And ironically I assume that she would have come to the same conclusion about my own political views.

I would like to invite her to a chat/discussion/debate where we can discuss and clarify our political views in an open and peaceful manner in the hope of finding some common ground that would allow us to find a path forward. 

However I am pretty non-confrontational usually and have never participated in any official debates. I am only considering doing so now as a last attempt before cutting my contact if I am unable to reconcile our conflicting views and values.

I would like to hear some advice and suggestions of what format to use for our debate, and how to approach it with an open mind and be able to discuss politics without it turning hostile and souring our relation and communication channel between our sides of the family further.

This is the first time I post here and so I hope I'm in the right place and that my post isn't breaking any rules. I do not believe I am ""soap boxing"", but if I am I aplogize, but not sure how I would be able to pose this question without expressing my views.

The ending was a trip and a half (not gonna act like I didn’t have to look up what the ending meant lol). It gets me so excited to start AW2. I have so many questions - and I didn’t play DLC so i’m going straight off the ending of AW1.

My mind is RACING going into AW2. Mr. Scratch has been tarnishing Alan’s life in the outside world. What does that look like? They sprung the whole “Mr. Scratch” character on us so quickly towards the end that I hardly even processed the weight behind it. What does his relationship with Alice look like? What was Alice’s recollection of the Dark Place? How long has Alan been stuck there between games (the long hair and beard tells me a while)? Do we learn more about Thomas Zane and where he is now? Is the Dark Place going to continue being personified by that old lady or will it be someone else? Will I have to keep collecting coffee thermoses? Where’s the homie barry?!

And WHO THE HELL IS THIS FBI AGENT??? Is she looking for Alan? She’s gotta be, maybe with the help of Alice? Is Mr. Scratch just on a rampage throughout? I dunnoooo!!

A short coffee-chat message that worked in NYC (and how you found people). What you tracked to keep momentum (columns in your sheet/Notion). Any NYC realities you accounted for (timing for on-sites, pay range norms, borough commute tricks).

A person posted this commission poster stating that at minimum, $75 for half a body drawing in a style which, to be frank, isn't uncommon or eye catching. This is part of the reason why people turn to AI for their art requests. You can get similar quality of results or better by prompting AI and giving a style example. 

Just as a test, I did exactly that to see what would happen. My prompt was to upload the above images and told ChatGPT to use that as a style reference and to generate an image of hobbits having a party.

https://preview.redd.it/m7t9gxi0dptf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b816c2f43ae70363759babaf8caffdf0d5c8e2

It's not exactly the right style but with very minimal effort and no editing, this is what was generated. With a higher effort prompt and a little photoshop color correction, this isn't that hard to make. 

So basically, why should we choose to support a ""human artist"" for $200 minimum (for this type of image) when we can generate the image for free (or for a small subscription fee) and get the same or better results?

I get the empathetic ""but people"" argument but that doesn't come into play for anything else. If I went to buy a coffee table and I could get one for $200 or I could get another one that looked and functioned basically the same for free, why would I bother spending the money on the coffee table?",0,1759848642.0,aiwars,42,0.46,False
1o0gx2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1o0gx2k/hi_marya_e/,Hi Marya E🥟,"
This is my unsent letter for you.
I need to apologize and explain myself. I know I did something wrong when I asked people in our circles about you instead of asking you directly. Back then, my mind and heart were already preoccupied with someone else, and I was scared to talk to you openly. I worried I might hurt you or our friendship, and I worried I might have given you mixed signals. At first I still doubted, even after you explained what happened with that girl. I was stuck in my assumptions. Lately I found the courage to ask you, and you answered and made it clear that it was not me. For that, I am truly sorry.

At that time, I asked others because of what a friend once said, that when you have a problem you tend to disappear, and that stuck with me. I was afraid to bother you. When you confirmed things that month by sending pictures, I felt guilty because I realized I had crossed a boundary by pressing about your private life. I know you value your privacy, and I should have respected that.

I also doubted little things, like your name, not because I did not trust you but because I valued your privacy and wanted to understand. Looking back, I should have respected the line between being close friends and strangers. I spent the beginning of this year reflecting on all of that, and that is why I ended up sending you letters. I really wanted to open up to you honestly if we ever met, but the timing was not right. Something happened, and I had to deal with my own situation and work first.

We were supposed to meet in September, I mentioned it around May, but I ended up declining because of what was going on in my life. Lately, I found out that you already have someone. It hurt, but at the same time, I felt happy knowing you have someone who will not leave you. You asked me if I was angry, I am not. I have no right to judge, and I understand we both value our privacy deeply.

Now I realize I was seeking answers from others because I was in denial about what I truly felt. I am sorry for falling for you. There were nights, walking at 3 AM, remembering what you said about the girl in the coffee shop, when my chest hurt so much and I could not explain why. Little moments from the past months felt like déjà vu, and I slowly realized how I felt. Hearing your voice made me feel safe, like I had found the right person. But when you told me you have someone, I accepted that you are not mine. We are just friends, like in our ""best friend forever"" contract. We may be soulmates, but we could never be lovers.

I am sorry for breaking that contract by falling when I was at my most vulnerable. I know my boundaries and I will continue to respect yours. For now, I have decided to step back and focus on healing and choosing myself. Honestly, when you deactivated your account and I received that message from you, I cried. I poured my heart out to my brother and we talked early one morning at church at 4 AM. I feel guilty that I was not there when you badly wanted to tell me about what was happening, because I was tied up with work and other priorities. I do not know exactly what happened with your partner, but I know it affected me deeply.

Honestly, you know I am the type of person who finds it hard to express myself. First because of the language, and second because of where I am coming from. You are actually the first person I have ever written a letter to, and God knows how grateful I am that I met you. I still do not know if what I felt was purely platonic or if it had already become something real, but every time you asked me if my height is tall already or if I am tall like yours, it made me realize that I should step back and respect my boundaries, that there could never be an “us.” Thank you for giving me that clarity, even when you did not continue asking me what was on your mind.

I do hope we can reconnect again someday, now that things are clear to me about what I feel toward you. Honestly, I do not want to lose you as a friend, because you matter and you are very special to me. This will be the last time I dwell on the past, because I want to move forward and forget the pain, like the lyrics ""I wish that I could wake up with amnesia.""

I do not want to cause your partner any worries or give our circles a reason to talk badly about you. I truly care about your relationship and do not want to make things harder.

Please know I am not angry or resentful. And I hope you're not upset at me. I just wish you both the best, and I pray for your happiness and peace.
You will always be in my prayers, Marya. Wherever you are, may you both stay safe and blessed.",1,1759848634.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of Tel Aviv titans: Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. Hapoel Tel Aviv. This isn’t just a game—it’s a family feud with basketballs. Let’s dissect the odds, news, and why Hapoel might want to invest in a “Do Not Trip” mat for their opponents.

---

### Parse the Odds: When Math Meets Mayhem

The numbers scream **Hapoel Tel Aviv as a near-80% favorite** (implied probability via their +1.31 decimal odds). That’s like betting on a rooster to crow at sunrise—predictable, but not exactly thrilling. Maccabi Tel Aviv, at +3.75, has a 21% chance, which is about the same odds as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich.

The spread? Hapoel is favored by **-7.5 points**, which is generous for a local derby. Imagine if your local bodega gave you 7.5 extra ounces of soda for free—Hapoel’s lead is that “generous.” The total points line sits at **174.5**, suggesting a high-scoring affair. If these teams were chefs, they’d be Gordon Ramsay and a guy who burns toast.

---

### Digest the News: Security, Wine, and a Dash of Drama

While the Spanish National Police are prepping for Valencia’s big game (probably overreacting to the idea of a *basketball riot*), our Tel Aviv teams have their own quirks. Hapoel, the reigning **EuroCup champions**, just defeated Gran Canaria in a finals sweep. They’re the basketball equivalent of a well-trained parrot: consistent, slightly smug, and always picking the right numbers.

Maccabi, meanwhile, recently lost to Anadolu Efes **81-87** in Montenegro, despite leading at halftime. Their offense? A classic “promising first date who forgets your name by the third coffee.” Also,

Spring in Brookvale never entered all at once; it leaked in through the seams. The willow trees in Farley Park put out cautious green flames. Joggers reappeared in their optimistic shorts. The air smelled faintly of wet earth and bakery sugar and something clean, like the city had opened a new window inside itself.

https://preview.redd.it/bu2ghq4kc0tf1.jpg?width=832&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6c6346034a802d228168bde2b1164fcbc064855

Elena left her apartment with a paperback, a thermos of tea, and a small hope that the day would behave. Her favorite bench sat a few steps back from the main path, angled so the late morning sun hit half her face and left the other half for thoughts that preferred shade. She loved this bench with the loyalty some people reserve for childhood pets: it had a missing slat near the left armrest where you could hide notes if you weren’t afraid of splinters, and a patch of peeling paint that looked like a map of an imaginary island. She had, on more than one occasion, named cities on that island and assigned them weather.

She rounded the curve of the path, already feeling the ease that comes from recognizing a place as your own.

Someone was sitting on her bench.

He wasn’t sprawled across it in the way of teenagers or asleep like a traveler between trains. He sat upright at the far end, a book open, a coffee balanced on the arm rest, posture attentive but not defensive. He wore a navy sweater despite the stubborn warmth and had a face that was less handsome than interesting, which Elena considered the better version of handsome. Brown hair that didn’t look consulted before being cut. A few faint lines at the corners of his eyes that suggested laughter had put in the hours. He looked like a person who had spreadsheets and then left them somewhere to be outside.

Elena stopped as if the path had risen in front of her.

He glanced up with that startled half-smile people have when a bird flies a little closer than expected. “Oh—sorry,” he said, as if he had been caught taking a cookie from a tin clearly labeled DO NOT.

“It’s not—” Elena began, humor tugging. “I mean, it’s a public bench.”

“It looks like it’s yours,” he said, nodding at the way she hovered with ownership and longing.

“It’s a bench I like,” she admitted, which felt less embarrassing to confess to a stranger than “I have relationships with furniture.”

He closed his book around a finger to save his page and gestured to the open spot beside him. “There’s room for two people to like it.”

Elena hesitated. She was not, by nature, the sort who sat beside men she didn’t know in parks. She had grown up with the smart, constant suspicion that the world was largely populated by well-meaning fools and a subset of dangerous ones. But it was nearly noon, sunlight was everywhere, and the stranger radiated the particular harmlessness of someone who had brought a book to a park and really intended to read it.

“Okay,” she said, and sat.

The bench was warm. The wood had absorbed the morning and gave it back in a slow exhale. Elena poured tea into the lid of her thermos and sipped. The stranger—man—resumed reading. For a few minutes, they pretended successfully that they occupied the bench separately, together. She could feel his awareness of her the way you feel weather changing—softer than attention, more insistent than indifference.

When she took out her book, they both laughed.

“What are you reading?” he asked, turning his toward her as if to show good faith.

“An old novel that does more with rain than is strictly necessary,” she said. “You?”

“A book about how to pay attention,” he said, holding up the cover. “Which I realize is both appropriate and rude.”

“It’s only rude if you learn how and then refuse,” she said.

A quiet settled that wasn’t quite awkward. Somewhere, a child blew a whistle and then apologized to the air for having done so. The willow leaves trembled as if they were considering their options. A dog with tremendous ears trotted by and looked at them like they were suspicious, then forgave them both.

“I’m Marcus,” the stranger said suddenly, as if introductions were better late than never.

“Elena.”

“Nice to meet you, Elena-who-likes-benches.”

“Nice to meet you, Marcus-who-reads-about-attention,” she returned.

His mouth pursed in a smile. “I moved to Brookvale in February,” he said, “so the existence of a day like this feels like a rumor come true. I’ve been living as if winter were just a policy.”

“It is,” Elena said. “But policies can be rewritten by committees of trees.”

They traded small, precise facts the way people do when they are carrying fragile larger ones and are not yet ready to set them down: she worked at the community museum on the corner of Maple and Third; he was a data analyst for a city agency that studied traffic patterns and attempted to accelerate people’s patience. She confessed to an unwholesome attachment to the bakery’s cardamom knots; he admitted he had recently tried to grow tomatoes on a windowsill with the enthusiasm of a man attempting to teach fish to knit. Neither asked why the other was alone.

After a while, a cloud wandered between the sun and the bench and the kind of breeze that exists only to hold the scent of something else—new cut grass, warm bread from nowhere—moved the air. Elena shifted, and Marcus politely pretended not to notice.

“I usually come earlier,” she said, surprising herself with the need to explain. “I had a call with my mother that extended beyond reason. She believes I am using my life incorrectly because I am not currently married to a man who has never heard of fantasy football.”

“Sounds like a very specific man.”

“She believes in him. He is the Loch Ness Husband.”

Marcus laughed. It was an unguarded sound. “My father sends me job postings for positions I am already doing. As if I might otherwise forget.”

“It’s nice to be loved so aggressively.”

“It is,” he agreed, but the word wore a small irony.

They fell into silence again—the better kind, warm around the edges. Elena read. Marcus read. The park went about its gentle business. After thirty minutes of companionable parallel lives, Marcus stood and stretched with the careful economy of someone who had once injured a back and learned humility from it.

“I’ll leave you to your bench,” he said.

“It isn’t—” she began, and then let the sentence slide into a smile. “Nice to meet you.”

He lifted his coffee cup in a little salute, tucked his book into his pocket, and walked away down the path, shoulders relaxed as if the day had thanked him. Elena watched him go because it felt like the right thing to do. He turned once, as if to confirm that the bench had not vanished in his absence, and then the curve of the path took him.

Elena returned the next Saturday at her earlier hour. The bench was empty, as it should be. She sat, poured tea, opened her book, and considered briefly that you could construct a life from such small comforts if you were allowed. Ten minutes later, someone’s shadow fell across the missing slat, and she looked up—and laughed.

Marcus stood there with the guilty smile of a person arriving at a party he hadn’t been invited to but had been assured would not mind. “I thought we were both pretending that this bench was public,” he said.

“We are,” she said. “And the public is welcome to sit.”

“Thank you,” he said gravely, “for your generosity.”

They sat. The willow leaves performed a minor ballet. The water in the nearby pond conducted negotiations with ducks. They didn’t speak for fifteen minutes. Then, as if a hidden metronome inside the bench had hit the interval that signaled conversation, they started.

“What does the museum have right now?” he asked.

“A small exhibit on the history of domestic tools,” she said. “The curator is obsessed with the way our objects reveal our priorities. There’s an egg beater from 1902 that looks like an interrogation device. And a darning mushroom you’d swear was made for a different species.”

“Do people come?”

“Families, students. People who like histories that can be put in a hand. You should come. We have a wall where visitors can leave notes about the tools they regret losing.”

“Like patience?” he said.

“Patience counts. But we prefer physical objects. A grandmother’s spoon. A father’s wrench. The note that says ‘my mother’s yellow colander’ is next to one that says ‘the corner store pencil sharpener that ate my homework.’”

“I like this,” he said. “I like the idea that a colander can be evidence of love.”

They met the next Saturday and the next. It was not a plan they had said aloud, precisely, but it belonged to both of them instantly. Weather willing, they arrived within the same narrow window, each carrying a book and the intention to both read and not read. The bench learned the shape of them; the missing slat collected their shadows like signatures. They spoke differently every week—sometimes engaging at once, sometimes waiting politely for the other to open whatever door needed opening. They traded notes on neighborhood coffee. They learned they had both lived, briefly, in cities that made them feel like minor characters in a novel that favored skyscrapers over people.

During their fourth meeting, Marcus came hurrying up the path ten minutes late, hair in chaos, sweater askew. “I’m sorry,” he said, breathless. “I had a fight with a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet won.”

“How terrible,” Elena said solemnly. “Is there counseling available for the grieving?”

“I’m considering a vengeance graph,” he said, and she laughed in that unselfconscious way he had started to consider his private weekly reward.

“Sit,” she commanded, and he did.

They read for a while before he said, “Can I ask you something that might be impolite?”

“Depends on your definition of the word.”

“Are you,” he said carefully, “here to avoid something, or are you here to find something?”

Elena looked out at the pond. A duck paddled with determined futility toward a crumb that drifted just beyond its immediate desire. “Yes,” she said.

Marcus nodded as if this were the correct answer. “Me too.”

They didn’t specify. It felt too early for specifics, and too honest to perform them.

In May, the tulips along the path grew unruly and insisted on opinions about sunlight. Marcus brought a bag of cherries one morning and they sat like thieves sharing loot, spitting pits gracefully into napkins. Elena told him about the seventh graders who had visited the museum and laughed at the word “mangle” until she demonstrated the tool and a hush fell that felt like learning. Marcus told her about the driverless bus pilot that had caused a city-wide existential crisis; nobody trusted a vehicle that refused to prioritize one person’s urgency over all others’. They took turns being the funny one and the thoughtful one.

“What’s the best conversation you’ve had with a stranger?” Marcus asked one week.

“You,” Elena said, and then stared at her book as if it contained an escape hatch.

“Sorry,” he said quickly. “That question was obnoxious. It’s like asking someone their favorite word and then judging them for not choosing a word with Latin.”

“No,” she said, and exhaled. “I meant you.”

His mouth opened and closed. “That’s… me too.”

The bench kept its composure admirably, as if it had been expecting this and had phoned ahead to its wood grain to ask for its most supportive pattern.

They expanded to weekdays, sometimes. A Tuesday evening if work hadn’t chewed them past sweetness. A Thursday morning if sleep had been kind. They occasionally overlapped with the joggers and the mothers with strollers and the elderly men who swapped newspapers as if trading cards. When they missed a week, the bench felt wrong without the other person on it, like an equation that refused to balance.

One Saturday in June, Elena arrived to an empty bench and a message on her phone from an unknown number: I’m running late. I stopped to help rescue a protest sign from a very determined gust of wind. I may smell like civic engagement. —Marcus.

She smiled at her screen and texted back: I’m the one in pink who’s trying not to name the ducks. Which she had done, once, in college, disastrously.

He arrived ten minutes later with hair more wind-scolded than usual and an apologetic bouquet of supermarket daisies. “For trespassing on your punctuality,” he said.

“You’re forgiven,” she said, taking the daisies and feeling, ridiculously, the kind of delight usually reserved for birthday cakes. She put them in her thermos lid with a bit of water and they looked absurd and perfect, like a child’s drawing had wandered into real life.

He reached into his bag. “I brought something else,” he said, a little shy. He produced a small paperback—slim, gray, obscure. “It’s a collection of essays about small rituals. There’s a piece about a pair of strangers who keep meeting at the same café booth without planning to and slowly become friends because of it.”

Her heart did a small, precise somersault. “Are essays allowed to stalk us?”

“They are obligated to,” he said. “It’s in their charter.”

They sat close enough that their elbows sometimes negotiated by accident. The sun climbed and folded itself in the branches. The park hummed. The day felt like a place you could live.

By July, it was routine but never rote. They didn’t declare their meetings in anyone’s calendar; they just trusted the bench. Elena began to notice the way Marcus’s expression changed when he was about to say something true—his mouth would find a careful shape, like he was trying to place a fragile object on a crowded shelf. Marcus noticed the way Elena’s eyes narrowed with humor just before a joke, like she was testing the line for weak spots.

The first time they touched was by mistake. A child careened past trailing a streak of soap bubbles and a scream of joy, and Elena startled as cool suds hit her forearm. Marcus, reacting, reached out and steadied her elbow. They both looked at his hand there—ordinary, warm, noncommittal—and then he withdrew it with an apology that did not attempt to be cute.

“No, it’s okay,” Elena said, and meant it beyond the bubble incident.

The second time they touched was not by mistake. It happened on a Thursday when the sky had tried rain, reconsidered, and left the air braided with damp. They walked a circuit of the pond instead of sitting because Elena had been chewed thin by a grant review that had treated her museum like an inconvenience. Marcus listened in the way she suspected he listened to bus routes—attentive, curious, willing to reroute if a better path presented itself. She finished speaking, hands exhausted of italics, and he said, “Do you want my arm?” It was the kind of question that, when answered yes, puts a person back inside their own skin.

“Yes,” she said, and he offered his elbow as if he were either a prince or a kindly usher. They walked the rest of the lap with that gentle formality. When they sat, the bench seemed to have grown a new section for them.

It couldn’t only be gentle. Real life arrived with its clatter. In August, Marcus missed two Saturdays because his father had a scare and he had to drive to the next state to sit in a hospital waiting room that had the décor of resigned silence. Elena texted him links to dumb videos and a photo of the daisies in her kitchen to prove that things persisted. When he returned, he looked both older and younger, as people do after worry has been invited to sleep on their couch for a week.

“My father is fine, mostly,” he said, settling onto the bench like a person sitting down after a standing ovation he hadn’t wanted. “He has opinions about sodium now and is excited to inflict them on the world.”

“I’m glad he’s okay,” Elena said. “I’m sorry you had to renegotiate your relationship with hospital coffee.”

“Thank you.” He looked at her with a steadiness that felt like the pause between a deep inhale and an equally deep exhale. “I missed this.”

“Me too,” she said.

Later that month, Elena confessed to something she had not told anybody in a long time. The museum director had offered her a path toward becoming senior curator—slow, political, requiring a patience that felt like asking a tree to politely stop growing. “I want it,” she told Marcus. “But I’m not sure I want it that way.”

“What way would you want it?”

“Honestly?” She laughed, and it sounded like surrender. “I want to build a small museum that cares as much about the hands that made the objects as it does about the objects themselves. I want people to leave with a story they can tell in a kitchen. I want to explain why the yellow colander mattered.”

“Do it,” he said, as if orders were kindness. “The world needs a colander museum. I will be a founding donor. Ten dollars and the promise of future baked goods.”

“Your support is overwhelming.”

“I’m very aggressive with encouragement,” he said.

They didn’t speak about love. It was there anyway. Not the cinematic kind that announces itself with fireworks over skylines, but the kind that leaves a sweater at your place and notices when you’re lying about being fine. On a hot afternoon in September, Elena reached for his hand and he took it with the surprised gratitude of a person handed water at mile twenty. They sat like that, their hands a small idea that had decided to stay.

It might have continued forever in its soft spiral if life hadn’t, as it does, demanded escalation. One Saturday in early October, Elena arrived to find the bench empty. She waited, checked her phone, read a page without understanding any of it, checked again. A text arrived at 12:17: I’m sorry. I can’t come today. Work emergency. —M.

A perfectly reasonable message. She wanted to throw her perfectly reasonable phone into the pond. Instead, she wrote back: Okay. Good luck. The bench will file a complaint with the city.

She didn’t hear from him until Tuesday evening. The silence tipped from patient to anxious at some point between those two. She walked to the park after work the way you walk to a friend’s apartment when they say “come over, I need to talk.” He was there on the bench, wearing the sweater she’d come to think of as an understudy for a hug. His face looked thoughtful in the tired way.

“I’m sorry,” he said immediately. “Not because I’m late—though I am—but because I disappeared. I have a reason, but I also have an apology.”

“I accept the apology,” she said, before knowing the reason. And then, because honesty had become oxygen with him: “But tell me anyway.”

He told her about an old relationship that had ended politely but tangled, the way polite things sometimes do. His ex had called him because her mother had died and grief had turned time into a hallway with doors that wouldn’t open. He had helped her with the practical—paperwork, a funeral program—because once you have loved someone it is difficult to watch them hold too many tasks in shaking hands. “I should have told you that’s where I was,” he said. “I didn’t because I felt like a child caught doing something stupid. Which is, I admit, extremely stupid.”

“Were you… tempted?” Elena asked, because the worst thing was imagining fear where there might not be any.

“To get back together?” He shook his head without hesitation. “We were a lesson that we both learned. I wanted to be useful, that’s all. And then I wanted to disappear because I felt guilty for wanting to be useful.” He scrubbed his face with his hands, then looked at her with a steadiness that steadied her in return. “I like you. I’m trying to be brave in the ways that liking requires.”

Elena sat with that. Fear retreated, slowly, like tide leaving small valuables behind. “Thank you for telling me,” she said. “I like you too. I am also trying to be brave.”

They sat shoulder to shoulder. Leaves detached themselves from branches and dramatized their descent. The bench held them as if it had been waiting for this exact weight. When they finally stood to walk a lap, the air had shifted into the particular crisp that suggests a weather change so permanent it should come with a brief brochure.

“Do you think we should… go on a date?” Marcus asked as if they had not been on a hundred of them already.

“This is either the slowest or the finest courtship in recorded history,” Elena said. “Yes. Take me somewhere that isn’t this bench and prove that tables exist.”

He took her to a restaurant that had tablecloths and forks that bragged about their weight, and he wore a tie with little bicycles on it, as if to reassure her that he hadn’t been replaced by a man who owned cufflinks. They ate pasta shaped like seashells and argued amiably about whether basil was cocky. He told her about a childhood dog named Otto who had eaten a couch. She told him about winning a middle school science fair by accident when her baking-soda volcano exploded with an enthusiasm no judge could forget. When he walked her home, he kissed her on the doorstep while the streetlight did its best imitation of a moon. It felt like a continuation rather than a new thing, which was exactly what she’d hoped for.

The bench did not resent being replaced occasionally. They still met there on Saturdays, but now sometimes they arrived together, and sometimes they left with his hand at the small of her back and sometimes with hers tucked into his elbow like she had been put there by a decent tailor. They read less and talked more. They debated whether ducks had interior lives or simply excellent union representation. They discussed her idea for the smaller museum, which had stopped being a fantasy and started to assemble a skeleton of practicality. He helped her draft a grant pitch that used phrases like “community stewardship” and “tactile history” without sounding like a committee had given birth to it. She came to his office once and watched him turn bus routes into elegant lines that looked like the veins in leaves; afterward they ate sandwiches on the steps and ranked the city’s crosswalks on charm.

Winter arrived eventually with its usual aggressive agenda. The bench iced over like a pastry. They moved to a café two blocks away and claimed a corner table with a view of the park, as if watching the bench could count as loyalty. They tried to sit in silence there like they had in the park, but cafés ask for conversation the way theatres ask for applause. They obliged. Elena met his friends at a trivia night where she contributed exactly two answers and one of them was “colander,” which felt like a sign from a very domestic universe. He met her mother in a careful trial run that involved brunch and the strategic deployment of questions that made Marcus look like a solid plank of wood rather than a gamble. Her mother later texted Elena, He seems like the kind of man who has winter socks, which in her family was the highest available praise.

On the final Saturday of February, the first shy thaw began. They went back to the bench with cups of too-hot tea and sat on a folded blanket because they had learned at least that much. The park reassembled itself around them: the willow promised it had not gone anywhere; the ducks discussed union issues; the cyclists reappeared with legs that had been assigned extra shadows by winter. Elena took out a notebook instead of a book.

“I drafted something,” she said, pulse tapping at her throat. “Mission statement. For the museum. It’s very boring and therefore probably very important. Will you listen?”

“I will listen like a bench,” he said, and she read.

We are building a place where everyday objects are evidence of extraordinary care. Where a dented pot is not an embarrassment but a biography. Where the stories you tell in kitchens are the stories that belong under spotlights. This is a museum for hands.

She finished and stared at the notebook as if it had transgressed. Marcus did not immediately comment. He let the words ride the air for a minute while the bench took them in.

“That’s beautiful,” he said. “And very clear. And very you.”

“I keep thinking it’s silly,” she confessed. “Like I am trying to ask people to pay for a tiny church to ordinary things.”

“Then I’m your first congregant,” he said. “And I tithe. Also, I know a woman on the city council who loves grants that have kitchen words in them. I can introduce you. She talks like a parade and she is excellent.”

Elena laughed, relief loosening some stubborn knot inside her. “Thank you.”

He shifted, suddenly uncertain. “May I ask you something slightly alarming?”

“Only slightly?”

“I love you,” he said. The words were plain as butter and warm as bread. “It feels absurd to say it on a bench, but then again, everything important in my life seems to have sat here first.”

Her heart did not leap; it settled. “I love you too,” she said. “I have for a while. I kept thinking I should wait until a more cinematic location presented itself. But this is better.” She touched the missing slat. “This is where we put things so they can stay.”

They kissed, careful at first because the bench was watching, then less carefully because it turned out the bench approved. When they parted, the park kept going as if nothing dramatic had happened, which Elena found both rude and perfect.

They began to use the pronoun we more often. We may go to the farmer’s market. We should buy batteries. We promised your mother we’d bring dessert. In March, when the lease on Marcus’s apartment came up, he moved in with Elena—not because rent demanded it but because mornings were improved by the proximity of someone else’s toothbrush. They discovered, to their relief, that they were compatible in the manners that most confound couples: he rinsed the oatmeal pot without being asked; she tolerated an unreasonable number of jackets on hooks. They fought properly a handful of times and learned how to pick the fight up and put it down without damaging it.

The museum of hands—though it would eventually, due to branding concerns, be called The Common Room—found a cheap storefront near the park. Volunteers painted walls. A retired carpenter built shelves that looked like they’d always been waiting for bowls. People brought objects and stories with a generosity that astonished Elena until she realized everyone was hungry for permission to consider their own lives worthy of display. A woman donated her father’s measuring tape with a note that read: He measured everything except his words. A teenager brought a cracked skateboard and said he wanted the crack to be part of it, not hidden. Marcus installed a data visualization on one wall that showed the threads connecting all the donated objects—grandmother to grandson, shipyard to kitchen, city to city. People stood in front of it and cried, quietly, without needing to explain.

On opening day, the mayor came for five minutes and pretended to be moved; the rest of the day belonged to ordinary people who did not pretend. Marcus hovered near the doorway like a lighthouse, greeting, guiding, occasionally handing a tissue with the confident gesture of a man who had chosen precisely the right number of napkins. Elena gave three short speeches because everyone kept noticing her and clapping, and each speech was mostly thank you said twenty different ways, because the phrase did not feel redundant.

That evening, after too much cheese and a victory slice of cake, they closed up the museum and walked to the park. The bench welcomed them as if it had been consulted by the day itself. They sat, hands twined, and watched the kind of sunset cities rarely remember to offer—subtle, with a single dramatic cloud putting on a show as if auditioning for the role of Hope in a community theater production. The willow threw lace at the air. Somewhere, a teenager practiced a trumpet and failed kindly.

“I brought something,” Marcus said, and Elena felt a brief absurd terror that he might produce a ring and a speech and a future she would say yes to but wished to anticipate. Instead, he opened a small notebook and slid a folded scrap of paper onto the bench between them. The paper had a smudge of blue paint on it that looked like a dot that had lost its sentence.

“What is it?”

“A bench plaque proposal,” he said, trying and failing to sound offhand. “I know the parks department. I can make this happen. But it needs your approval. I won’t do it without.”

She unfolded the paper. In neat letters, it read:

IN HONOR OF THE WRONG PLACE, RIGHT TIME  
For anyone who thought they were interrupting someone else’s day and found their own instead.  
—E. & M.

Elena laughed, startled and soft. “You want to name a bench after an accident.”

“I want to name it after a routine we chose,” he said.

She nodded. “Yes. Please. Let there be a place where people who think they’re late discover they’re exactly on time.”

He leaned his head against hers, and they sat like that until the park politely asked them to consider bedtime. When they stood, Elena traced the peeling patch of paint that looked like an island and thought about the cities she had named there before Marcus. She decided one city could keep its name: Serendipity, population whoever sat down without meaning to and stayed on purpose.

Months later, the plaque appeared with minimal bureaucratic drama. Someone had polished the bench, replaced the missing slat, and touched up the paint. Elena almost missed the roughness of it, the way we miss our scarred versions when we heal, but then she saw the plaque and realized that imperfection wasn’t the only way to tell the truth. The words shone modestly in the shade.

People paused to read. Some smiled and kept walking. Some sat and pretended not to be waiting for anyone. Once, on a Tuesday afternoon, an older couple sat and argued in tender whispers about a daughter who had moved too far away, and then they touched the plaque as if it were a talisman and stood and made a plan. Elena cried selfishly at a distance and then texted Marcus: The bench is doing outreach.

He wrote back: It always did.

Years have a way of accumulating without permission. They did their best to consent to them anyway. The Common Room flourished; Marcus’s maps grew more elegant; their apartment collected the gentle clutter of two people who had voted yes repeatedly and found the ballot addicting. They still met at the bench on Saturdays whenever they could. Sometimes a whole month would vanish into schedules and obligations and they would arrive feeling like refugees and the bench would admit them without requiring paperwork.

On an anniversary that did not have a number with traditional assigned gifts, they brought coffee and the original supermarket daisies, which had become a joke so old it felt like a family member. They sat and watched a new crop of ducks negotiate territory and a trio of teenagers rehearse a dance with the seriousness of surgeons. After a comfortable silence, Marcus said, “Do you ever think about how this would look if we had missed it?”

“You on the far end of the bench,” she said. “Me pretending not to be annoyed. Both of us going home and telling someone later that the day was almost good.”

“I’m glad we met,” he said, understated and overfull.

“Me too,” she said. “Wrong place, right time.”

He reached into his pocket and, this time, produced a small ring with a stone that looked like the exact color of the pond when it was thinking about being green. He didn’t kneel; he didn’t speechify; he didn’t pretend this moment didn’t have a thousand smaller moments holding it up like scaffolding. “Will you marry me?” he asked as if asking her to read a few more pages with him before the park closed.

“Yes,” she said, and the bench, unflappable, took their weight as if it had been practicing for this exactly—because of course it had.

They did not invite the mayor to the ceremony. They got married under the willow, the one that had thrown lace all those afternoons, with thirty people and a picnic and a violinist who played just badly enough to make everyone brave. The plaque watched solemnly. When the violinist made it through a delicate passage without falling apart, the ducks applauded by accident.

“Do you know what I like best about us?” Elena asked later, when they were alone for the first time as whatever married meant.

“Everything?” Marcus said, which could have been too much in another mouth but wasn’t in his.

“That we met by chance,” she said, “and then we kept showing up by choice.”

He considered this. “The world should really hand out plaques for that.”

“It does,” she said, touching his chest. “Eventually, it does.”

They walked home the long way. The park exhaled. The bench, dignified now with its plaque and paint and purpose, held two teenagers trying to decide whether to admit they were already in love. Elena wished them courage in her head. She pictured them years from now, with different hair and gentler eyes and a story about a routine that had saved them from their own guardedness.

As they left the park, Marcus looked back the way he always did to check that the bench had not uprooted itself and wandered off. It was there, of course. It had always been there, waiting for someone to believe the wrong place could be a doorway and the right time could be any time you sat down and stayed.

And if, long after, people visiting The Common Room asked Elena which exhibit mattered most, she’d walk them not to a glass case but to a photograph in the lobby: a simple image of a wooden bench under a willow tree, a small brass plaque catching afternoon light. On the placard beneath the photograph were four lines:

1o0grj5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0grj5,Need help with relentless biting,"Let me preface this novel by asking you guys to please skip the usual banal advice, skip Jackson Galaxy, and please skip this post entirely if you have not dealt with a similar issue yourself. I am a very capable dog trainer of several decades who trains at a competitive level and knows how to do research and apply methodology. This is a situation of unusual severity and I'm specifically seeking advice from people who have found the ways to overcome the same or similar issue. 

-----

I rescued a very young kitten from a life-or-death situation last year. He was only 5 weeks old if not slightly under. I have no idea if he had a mother at that point, but he was likely pulled out of his litter shortly before I entered his life. He was about to be killed by children in a bad neighborhood, I saw it, jumped out of the car, and basically fought them off. Next morning he came down with a bad case of calicivirus.

I wasn't going to keep him originally, but just foster him until he's healthy and find him a home, but my oxytocin interfered with the plan. By the time he recovered and was ""ready to go"", I was too attached, so he stayed. 

He was raised like a puppy. I'm a dog person, and that's all I know. He was extensively socialized, trained to sit, down, shake hands, fetch, etc. He was taught to sit and wait at any door if he wanted it to open. He will jump on objects on command and perform an array of tricks. He was trained with a clicker and a target stick and loves learning new behaviors to this day. Training sessions are always the highlight of his day. He is leash trained and is a staple around the city, regularly going to pet stores and coffee shops. He loves car rides. He is a strictly indoor cat and while he is only allowed outside on a leash, he gets daily walks around the house and on the property. 

-----

Today he is a well rounded, good looking, healthy 17 months old who is social and very people oriented, loves dogs, big or small, and displays signs of being strongly bonded to everyone in the family. Yet he bites everyone, humans and dogs, on the daily. 

The biting issue started very early on, right around 7 weeks old. At first I dismissed it as a pretty age-apropriate behavior, doing the usual ""disengage"" or ""redirect onto a toy"", but it never worked. His biting only intensified over time. He very soon lost all interest in toys (he has many dozens and of course I always animate them for him and not expect him to just pick up a dead toy) and focused entirely on biting living things. He has never scratched anyone, it's all mouth, all teeth. Never ever claws.

He has several types of biting behavior. Most of them are manageable, such as ""you've overpetted me"", ""I'm bored"", ""I'm hungry, hurry up"", "" I love you and can't contain my emotions"", but one type is becoming impossible to manage. I call it his hunting bite. 

The hunting bite is something reserved just for me. When he bites my husband or our dogs, it's a different dynamic. Husband usually gets ""love bites"". Dogs usually get a ""wrestle bite"" when he wraps himself around their necks, bites and holds on. By contrast, the hunting bite is super quick. 

He will quietly sit somewhere, and if you don't know him, you wouldn't realize it's not just harmless sitting. He sits upright, eyes wide open, ears up, intensely, but quietly watching me from a distance, focusing on my extremeties, waiting for his moment. When he feels the moment is right, he makes his move. He flies up, grabs my forearm with his mouth, punches holes in it, and immediately slides off and runs away. It takes him around one second to complete the whole sequence from launching to running away. He causes a decent amount of damage in that one single second. Those are typically very painful, punishing, full force bites. I occasionally can hear my skin ripping as he latches on. He has a strong preference for forearms, but if those are unavailable, he'll go for an ankle. 

-----

The hunting bite is at its worst right before bedtime and first thing in the morning. Those are also the bites I have come to fear because they really really hurt.

I am very careful when I'm getting into bed. Right after I brush my teeth (which he always assists with, sitting right there at the sink) and head for bed, he's at the ready. He sits off to the side on the floor, as quiet as a mouse, intensely focusing on me. I know what he wants to do, so I'm very careful at this point. I undress and get into bed, and it's usually right before I get under covers that the attack will come. I've learned to throw articles of clothing up in the air as I take them off, and that gives me enough time to slide under covers unharmed, leaving him disappointed. If he were not able to bite me, he often will jump up and furiously dig at the blanket, like a dog who's digging a hole in the ground, in an attempt to extract a foot or a hand. If still unsuccessful, he will continue sitting and watching, waiting for a slipup. I might carelessly expose a wrist when putting my phone on the charger. I might get hot and stick a foot from under the blanket. Those are his glory moments.

We use white bedsheets, and I'm now washing them almost daily. Why? Because blood. Blood from my cat bites.

-----

If you think this is bad enough, let me tell you about my mornings. 😭

He will typically attack me between 5 and 7 AM, when I'm dead asleep, by latching onto whatever extremely is available to him. On a rare occasion he'll do it in the middle of the night, around 2 AM. I cannot begin to describe how awful it feels to wake up because of sudden sharp pain. Sometimes he bites so hard, I'll sob into my pillow, tears and all. He doesn't prefer biting anything else aside of arms and legs, but on two occasions when all my body parts were under covers, he bit me on the face.

-----

I am really struggling with this behavior. I spent the entire summer in long sleeves and long pants because I don't want people to think I'm a cutter or a domestic abuse victim. My arms are completely covered in scars and wounds at various stages of healing. As soon as some heal, new ones appear. It has come to the point I feel terrorized in my own house. I am not the kind of person to ever ""give up"" on an animal, but my quality of life is really suffering at this point, and I need a solution.

The pictures in this post are from several months ago. Month of May, he just turned one year old. I dare not show you what my arms look like today. It's worse. Significantly worse.

-----

I've tried almost everything in my arsenal. I even tried, in my profound desparation, swatting him with a towel. It was an interesting experience, the one I'm not eager to repeat, and oh btw, it didn't work. My observations from the towel correction were as follows:

- He is utterly unable to connect the cause and consequence. In his mind, he is doing something nice and pleasant, and I just attack him out of the blue. Zero connection. It would be wrong to punish an animal who can't connect the dots and understand the reason.

- He is not dissuaded by negative reinforcement. Not at all. He takes is as a failed attempt to bite and immediately gears up for another go, going straight back into his sitting/focusing mode. 

- Timing is difficult to manage. These attacks are super quick, and usually by the time you have a chance to react, he's long gone. 

The other things I've observed and was able to analyze are:

- The cat was obviously taken from his mother way too young and has zero bite inhibition. It wasn't my fault and I can't change that. 

- The cat genuinely absolutely does not understand that he is hurting me. He is a narcissistic psychopath, like any proper cat, and strongly believes if something feels good to HIM, surely it feels good to everyone else. I underscore again. This cat clearly has no clue he is hurting me.

- The bites are self reinforcing. It's not that he's using teeth to elicit something from me. I'm experienced enough to know to never inadvertently reward bad behavior. Biting has never gotten this cat any benefits. Doors don't open, cheeks don't get brushed, churu doesn't rain from the sky. It's the act of biting itself, the sensation of fangs sinking into warm living flesh that he is seeking. I know from dogs that self-reinforced behaviors can be the hardest to estinguish.

-----

My next move will be to figure out how to banish him from the bedroom, so at least I'm only harassed during the day, when I'm awake. I haven't done that yet solely because he uses human toilet for his litterbox needs, and I am afraid that locking him out of the master suite will mess with his potty training. However, I'm seriously considering to put up a small crate and crate him overnight. I can't continue living in terror, with bloody bedsheets and shredded arms, crying because of burning pain first thing in the morning. 

Having said that, I also know that locking him out at night is simply MANAGEMENT, and not TRAINING. It's a half ass solution. Necessary at this point? Yes. Productive as far as correcting the behavior? Nope. 

------

If any of you guys are experienced enough to help me navigate these waters, please speak up! I'm at the end of my rope and really need help. 

Just please, as I asked at the beginning of this post, spare me the banalities of ""don't play with your hands"", and ""exercise your cat more"". Remember, this is a cat who has a tremendously full, happy life and wants for nothing. I couldn't possibly give him more than he's already getting. Our entire lives are rotating around him and his needs, and he gets more attention and environmental enrichment than 90% of domestic cats in the country. Training sessions, play sessions, fetch the ballie sessions, car rides, Starbucks, new environments, outside walkies, romping with his canine friends DAILY. This is not the case of a sad bored youngster shut away in solitude while owners are at work. 

I've discussed this issue with various (very) professional (very) famous dog trainers in my circle and came away (very) frustrated. No meaningul advice or ideas at all. I swear if I hear one more time, ""OH I would NOT be able to tolerate THAT!"", I'll explode. Really? You wouldn't ""tolerate"" that, so what exactly would you DO? Would you drive him off to the woods and throw him out? Would you unload him onto an unsuspecting person and make it their issue? Would you euthanize a healthy animal because you ""can't tolerate that""? That's not how we roll around here.

Please tell me there is hope for the fluffy holy terror.

1o0gn5x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0gn5x,Want Ubuntu On Your OTVOC 15?,"Would you like to know how install Ubuntu onto your OTVOC 15 laptop?

In my case, I just installed Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (stable Linux distro) onto my OTVOC 15, which had Windows 11 Pro. 
Yes... I wrote over the latter, because I am no longer ""into"" Windows. 
This laptop is VERY THIN, fast (16GB Ram / 512GB NVME storage) and very portable. 
The Chinese made it look like a Mac with Windows 11. 🤣 
This would be the ideal companion for when I travel. So... I decided to install Ubuntu onto it, to match my larger Thinkpad P50's environment. 
There are no instructions anywhere online about how to get into Bios and perform an OS installation for OTVOC laptops. I believe I could be the FIRST person to ever install Linux on one of these laptops.
Therefore, I had a sip of coffee and muttered ""feck it!""
I already had a USB flashdrive with Ubuntu's iso on it, via Balena Etcher, standing by.

My instructions (100% Successful):
Laptop should be powered off.
First...
Insert the USB flashdrive into the computer.
DON'T TURN ON THE POWER YET.

To get into Bios...
Hold down F2, while you tap the power button.
In Bios...Go to ""Secure Boot"", and disable it.
Then... Move over to ""Boot"" and move the USB drive to the #1 position at the top of the list.
Hit F10 to save and exit.

Now... The laptop will reboot automatically. 
Just sit back, and let the USB do it's ""Ubuntu song and dance""...
Just follow the on-screen instructions.
Patience is key, this will take a while. 
You can use your mouse to click on the tabs in the Ubuntu set-up.
After the installation is completed, the first reboot will take a while, which is normal. 

👉 If you see a weird screen with some coding and errors, don't panic or throw a shit fit...
You'll have to go back into Bios. (hold CTRL/Alt/Delete, then quickly go hold down F2)
Then go to ""Boot"", and move ""Ububtu"" to the #1 spot in the boot order.
Hit F10 to save and exit.

1o0gmgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o0gmgp/theres_something_in_the_woods/,There’s Something in the Woods,"Hello everyone, this is my first time writing something but I need help. My friends and I are stuck, Where? I have no clue but we need help I don’t know if you can help us but if you see this please comment solutions to our situation. 

Let me start from the beginning so you can get the full story. My two friends Gracie, Lexa, and I, all three work at Mountain View National Forest, Gracie and Lexa are rangers while I work in the wildlife department taking care of sick animals that get brought in. We’ve worked there for three summers now and this is our fourth. We know this park like knowing a hometown you’ve grown up in, or knowing all the words to one of your favorite songs. We grew up camping here with our families, we would plan a trip and all get together, and pick out campsites next to each other. 

When us girls were old enough we started hiking here annually at the end of summer. Every year on the last day of work we pack up and hike out to our favorite trail, Rocky Falls. It’s a 5 day hike and it’s not too hard of terrain to maneuver, that being said we know this hike it’s fun and quite easy, it’s our 10th year and we hike the same trail every year. It’s more like a tradition these days. So the three of us set out on our way. 

“Do you think we’ll make it to camp before dark?, we set out a little later this year than we have before.” I questioned as we were walking. I heard Lexa say a quick response “yeah I’m sure we’ll get there right at sunset.” Yes we’ve hiked this multiple times but I can never get tired of the nature and free feeling I get when we’re out here just on our own. As I look around Lexa and Gracie are a couple steps ahead of me, them being taller they have that advantage. We usually never leave this late but Craig the lead park ranger was talking our ear off about being careful. We told him we would and it would be like our normal hike. 

As we’re walking I can’t help but look around everything is so bright and vibrant, the grass is green, the sun beams are bursting through the trees onto the path we’re on. The path isn’t rugged but it’s not gravel either it’s more of an overgrown dirt path, we try and keep up on maintenance as much as we can but we got pretty busy this summer. There was twice the amount of tourist as usual this year. We have about two more hours until we reach the designated camping spot. 

There shouldn’t be anyone out here since this trail has been closed to the public for about 3 years now, they had to close it down for wildlife and flooding. The only people that have hiked this trail since are the three of us, Gracie’s dad is management at the park and he lets us hike out here once a year. 

As we’re walking I can feel the slight breeze and it feels quite nice against the hot temperatures we’ve been having lately. We’re in a pretty shaded area considering as the farther we travel the denser the trees get. “Wow it’s so nice out today that breeze feels amazing!” Gracie says with excitement spinning in a circle with her arms out, Lexa and I send out words of agreement. As we’re coming up on camp it’s getting cooler as the sun goes down but it’s still quite humid. “Oh look! Camps just over this hill” Lexa squeals out “oh yes finally we’ve been walking for ages.” Gracie says jokingly throwing her arms down in a slump and walking like a zombie. 

As we walk closer to camp there’s some logs sat around a campfire that looks like it hasn’t been used in well a year because we’re the only ones that come out here. The camp is a little overgrown grass and weeds tall in some areas the campfire looks like a bear ran through it the stone circle all messed up and thrown everywhere. “Well looks like we have cleanup to do ladies!” I say clapping twice like I’m in a fairytale wishing that clapping would clean it up for me. It didn’t, I was picking up the stones for the fire pit when I heard something crackle and crunch in the trees, I snap my head over and look but I couldn’t see anything. 

We cleaned up and now are sitting around while our designated cooker (Lexa) throws together some pb&j’s for us, well mine is basically just the J because I despise peanut butter. Since we didn’t want to bring a whole loaf of bread we just brought some flatbread, not the best tasting but great after a long hike. Since we didn’t have much room in our packs and didn’t want to carry much weight we mostly just brought easy snack and jerky and stuff like that. After we eat I ask the girls if they want to play some card games, my favorite is “bs” it’s easy and so fun. I pull out the cards that I brought and we all sit around the fire playing some games.

“Alright 3 Aces” I say as I put 3 cards in the pile. “That’s Bullshit!” Lexa yells out with a laugh. I sigh as I fake reaching to the pile to grab the big stack of cards that have accumulated but at the last second I flip over the 3 aces I had set down. “Wrong take your stack Lexi” I reply with a light tone to my voice using the nickname we had given Lexa too many years ago. “Oooo nice Bailey” Gracie says throwing her cards down and standing up with a grunt. 

After playing cards, talking, and telling spooky stories for a while it’s now dark the only light being the moon and fire that’s just still barely burning. It’s cooled off quite a bit still not cool enough for a jacket but cool enough that we all scoot just a little closer to the fire. We’ve all pretty much quieted down stuck in our own minds taking bites off the s’mores we made, “you know she would’ve loved this” one of the girls muttered and I sat back with a sigh tears coming to my eyes thinking about our lost friend. 11 years ago we weren’t just 3 we were a group of 4, Callie. Callie grew up with us her family would camp with ours and when we started hiking by ourselves 11 years ago at just 16 and 17 she was right there with us. 

I guess I should tell you the reason we are the only people that have permission to camp here. 10 years ago Gracie, Lexa, Callie, and I set out on our second hike by ourselves on this very trail, it was amazing. On the fourth night the last night of our 5 day trip everything was great we all shared a tent because that’s just who we are. When we woke up that morning Callie wasn’t in the tent she must’ve went to the river we thought but as the time dragged on and she didn’t come back we went looking for her, we looked for hours before finally radioing Craig the park ranger that we couldn’t find her. For a week a search party of about 100 rangers and 50 volunteers searched and searched for Callie but there was just no trace of her, so every year at the end of summer the three of us pack our stuff up and we hike this trail for Callie in honor of her. 

“Yeah she would’ve” I barely breathed out trying my best to hold back tears wiping at my eyes. As we sat there flames gone now just burning embers, I kept thinking back to that night how fun it was we were all laughing, screaming because we scared each other from the spooky stories we were telling. I can’t even imagine what she went through and I’ve tried and tried to piece together what could’ve happened to her but I honestly have no idea. 

The only thing that ever came to mind was maybe she woke up and had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and while she was in the trees a bear came to camp but that doesn’t make any sense because why wouldn’t there have been any tracks or anything? I can only imagine how scared and alone she was, it just makes me feel so guilty. Im starting to feel exhausted from our hike, and a little sick I feel pretty dizzy like my head is in a haze almost like I’m high but I haven’t smoked anything. I’m pulled out of my thoughts when Lexa stood up with a sigh and said 

“why don’t we head to bed we have a long day tomorrow if we want to reach the next campsite before sunset.” I stood up in agreement, thanking whoever’s out there that we’re going to lay down I can kinda see Lexa touching her forehead like she has a headache but I’m more focused on grabbing Gracie’s hand pulling her up with me. We all piled into the tent and muttered our good nights, got in our respective sleeping bags, turned the lamp off and drifted off to sleep. 

I woke with a jump my dream pulling me back to reality, it was about Callie the last night we ever shared with her except she was calling out to me from beyond the tree-line. I was sitting by the fire Gracie and Lexa nowhere in sight I didn’t quite know where they were or why I would be out here by myself. I felt off like I wasn’t in my own body but watching myself from the shadows, I knew I still had a headache and my ears were muffled like I was underwater. I could hear screams, shouts for help, and Callie kept saying “you guys left me” over and over again, it started out groggily and formed into the voice I knew was hers. 

I could see myself sitting there but my eyes weren’t mine they were clouded with a white substance over them, I was so still like my body and mind were separate. I looked up from the shadows and I seen her, but it didn’t move like anything should, the last thing I remember before I woke was a almost robotic voice coming from behind me saying “tell the truth” I could feel their breath on the back of my neck then I woke. I sat up and looked around the tent I seen it was empty I panicked for a second but my rational thoughts came back to me, the girls must be packing up already, I made my way out of the tent to see them packing bags and laughing at my barefoot, messy haired, and still half asleep form stumbling over to them. 

“Hey sleepy head why don’t we pack up and get a move on eh?” Gracie laughed out looking me up and down. “Yeah yeah let me get ready and we’ll get this tent down and head out.” I muttered turning away from them and heading to my pack. 

I still had a little ache in my head but it wasn’t near as bad as last night, maybe I’m getting sick? I don’t know but I’m just glad the suns not shining as bright today or the cicadas in the woods aren’t as loud as yesterday. Looking down at my hands I notice a bruise on my forearm not a big one just a little circle maybe the size of a golf ball. “Huh wonder where that came from” I muttered to myself. 

After cleaning up camp the four of us were on our merry way skipping, laughing, and just enjoying the nature. It was a cool morning and we were basking in it before it became unbearably hot out, I was walking with Callie and Gracie, Lexa ahead of us a couple steps walking backwards to talk to us. “You’re gonna fall doofus” Gracie said to her Callie and I nodding in agreement “yeah it’s downhill from here to the campsite, you’ll be rolling down.” I laughed out “ooo look at me I’m one with nature I know my way around here” Lexa said walking backwards still but legs bent in a way to seem funny with her arms waving around. 

It was just then she stumbled over a rock and fell backwards, good thing she had her pack on or she would’ve landed right on her back. We all gasped and lunged to catch her before busting out laughing when we realized she was okay, the laughter died down and as Callie was helping Lexa up Lexa’s head swiveled to the left and then she locked eyes with something beyond the tree-line. Her faced turned to horror as she looked back at us and scarily rushed out a “Guys look!” I turned my head to where she was looking and my mouth dropped open in confusion and fear, “h-h-how the hell are we at the waterfall!?” I stammered out barely loud enough for them to hear but they already knew what I had said because Gracie’s panicked voice came next “guys we weren’t supposed to reach the waterfall until tomorrow!” 

I looked at all of their fear filled faces and I frantically patted my pockets reaching for my phone. Phones are completely useless out here but we keep them on us to watch the time. “Guys it’s Wednesday” I whispered out to them “W-what do you mean we started our hike yesterday! Monday!” “There’s no way we slept a whole day without one of us waking up” shouts of concern were spewing out of all our mouths I couldn’t even tell who was saying what.

“Okay stop” Gracie yelled trying to get our panicking to come to a halt, we quieted down and she continued “somethings wrong here. We’re missing a whole day and we couldn’t have slept through the day without walking the miles we did and sleeping at the second campsite” “yeah so what the fuck is going on” Callie muttered kinda scoffing under her breath. That was weird Callie never really scoffed at someone when they said something she always thought it was quite rude, wait. Callie’s dead. She has been for 10 years, I frantically grasp my neck and look up at Callie she looked off if you wanted to say that like her complexion wasn’t how it was supposed to be. 

When I looked really looked at her she was different, her eyes just a little too far apart, her hair too long and thin, her frame too frail. My hands finally reached what they were looking for and I grasped the gold chain that had a golden lilac with a purple gem in it, I looked at it then at Callie and the at the other girls and I shakily stated “Guys Callie is dead she has been, it’s the 10th anniversary of her disappearance we’re here hiking on the Rocky Falls trail for her.” 

I could see the memories come flooding back to Lexa and Gracie, Lexa jumped back from “Callie” as the too frail girl let out a gargled laugh, her eyes darted back to me and I could see the hatred in them. She then sagged her bones going at odd angles a strangely yell falling from her lips as she hunched and dropped on all fours and crawled into the tree line opposite of the waterfall. 

“What the fuck!” “What the hell is going on” What the fuck was that” “that’s not Callie” panicked and fear filled yells came from all of our lips as we started sprinting to the waterfall, since this hike was so long they built a little shack cabin thing for the hikers in case they needed some shelter. We bolted in the cabin Gracie and Lexa rushing in me bringing up the rear, Lexa slammed the door and said “what the hell is going on” 

I spun around and looked at the interior of the cabin same as it always was when I seen something sitting on the little coffee table, I made my way over and picked up the little purple notebook and the front of it sent shivers all the way down my back to my knees and made them weak. “Why the hell is Callie’s journal here? No how the hell did it get here? Who’s fucking with us!” I dropped the journal like it was on fire and snapped my head to look at them, “someone has to be messing with us right?” “Well I don’t know Gracie did you not see the fucking monster in the goddamn woods!”. Lexa yelled at the gaping Gracie. 

“Guys we have to calm down and just think there has to be an explanation for all of this. Mass hysteria, yeah that could be it or drugs we took on accident.” I said faking confidence. “Let’s just calm down go back outside walk around a little bit and make sure it’s safe we have to get to the next campsite before dark.” 

I knew Gracie was right but I just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very very wrong. I keep replaying the morning back in my head and I can’t seem to remember if Callie blinked at all or if she (if I can even call it that) really ever interacted with us when we weren’t talking to it. I’m thrown out of my thoughts when Lexa slowly opens the door, we all peek out and step out cautiously one by one, we look around the crashing sounds of the waterfall drowning the woods noises out. “I think it’s gone” “you hope” Gracie scoffs back at me. 

“Let’s just stick together make sure the coast is clear and we can keep walking.” Lexa half smiles as much as she can in the situation. We walked around the cabin then made our way too the waterfall, I scanned the tree-line looking for anything that could explain what’s happening, I didn’t find anything it just looks the same as it does every year. It’s a pretty cloudy day outside shade casting over the horizon and it’s cooler, which I’m thankful for because I could not do another 90 degree day especially not right now. We deemed the coast clear and pack up our bags and hopped back on the trail, we’ve been walking for about 30 minutes now but I can’t help but check the tree-line to see if that thing is following us. 

Every now and then I will hear leaves crunching or a twig snapping in the distance and I snap my head to look but nothing is ever there. “We should be getting close to the next campsite.” I hear Gracie say as she looks back at us “yeah I think I see the turn up ahead” I say feeling a little better with everything that has happened. 

We keep walking for a couple of minutes and when we come up to the turn I hear something I shouldn’t, water crashing. I start to jog up ahead of the girls and when I turn the corner I want to faint I think I almost do. The waterfall, the cabin, the fire pit; it’s all there. “Holy shit” I start running Lexa and Gracie’s yells and pleads to stop fading behind me as I sprint straight to the cabin, I slow my steps as I’m coming up to the door and I see a note nailed into the wooden door, red words stare back at me as Gracie and Lexa finally caught up to me. “You left me” the note reads as the girls read and process it I say 

“I don’t know what’s going on or where we are but I think we should get in the cabin, barricade the door and have a calm discussion on what we’re gonna do.” I say as calmly as I possibly can, my hands shaky and sweaty I rub them on my jeans as I reach for the door handle and swing it open. 

Inside the cabin everything is the same I throw my pack down and plop down on the couch my head coming to rest in my hands. “We gotta find a way out of here.” Gracie stammers out as they both sit across from me. “Let’s just figure something out, you guys don’t remember anything from yesterday?” Lexa questions. “No the last thing I remember is going to sleep Monday night” Gracie says “I had a dream that night”. As I tell them about the dream that I had I can see something click in their minds I see the shock on their faces and their eyes go wide, just then I know we all dreamt of the same thing. 

“Well what are we going to do?” Lexa questions, I sigh and close my eyes rubbing my hands down my face, headache returning. I don’t think we should talk about this now, we’re too freaked out and will never be able to settle down. I truly have no idea what’s happening to us but I don’t think we’re in our world anymore I don’t want to say that out loud and freak the girls out but I think they are coming to the same conclusions. I finally break out of my thoughts “Let’s just eat and sleep and we will figure this out tomorrow okay.” 

I say seeing their nods of approval I stand up and grab some jerky from my pack I honestly don’t think I could eat anything more than that, I don’t even want to eat anything but I know I have too. I just can’t believe what is going on, I’m missing a whole day of memory, that thing in the woods, and the fact that we went straight down the trail and ended up going in a circle right back to where we started. As I’m eating my beef jerky I hear it, little rustles of fast paced footsteps outside crunching in the leaves more like galloping, crawling I stand up with a start Gracie and Lexa doing the same looking out windows trying to see what is out there. 

“I-is that thing out there” Gracie trembles out “I can’t see anything it must be in the trees.” I hear Lexa reply. But I see It, it’s not out in the open I see half of its face peeking out from behind a tree. It’s so low to the ground I can only imagine its knees bent at impossible angles, maybe even in a backwards bend watching us staring, studying. I’m frozen staring into the only eye visible, chills all over my body I finally come back into my body and I pull the curtain so I can’t see it anymore and it can’t see me. “Let’s pull the shades on the windows just try to drown it out.” I shakily say.  

We get our sleeping bags out and lay them next to each other I don’t think any of us will be getting much sleep tonight. I can see all of us are terrified, Lexa is muttering too herself, and Gracie is a little bit more composed but I can still see the fear in her eyes. “It’s gonna be okay we’ll figure this out” I say as I put my hands comforting on their shoulders. “Let’s get some rest we have a lot to do tomorrow.” We say our goodnights and they turn over. I pull the radio out of Gracie’s bag we always bring a radio in case anything goes wrong and we need to contact the ranger station, “hello this is Bailey I’m with Gracie and Lexa and we need some help we are at the waterfall cabin on Rocky Falls trail. Please get back to me when you can over.” 

Not hearing a response I pull out my phone getting up trying to see if I can get any signal, walking to corners of the cabin to try and get any service just for a text, I know there’s not going to be any bars but I still try. I get on all of my apps just trying to get anything. And that’s where we’re at now Reddit is the only app I’m able to post on and now your all caught up, I don’t quite know where we are or what is going on all I know is what I’ve just told you. As I’m sitting here typing this the girls have fallen asleep but I don’t think I will be getting much sleep tonight I can still hear that thing outside and it’s much closer now, it’s right at the door softly knocking so only I can hear it whispering to me, “you left me” “come out Bailey I started the fire” I know what you did” 

I didn’t answer I couldn’t I was frozen in fear goosebumps covering my arms. It’s circling the cabin now I can only hope it can’t get in. So please if you can help us we really need it I will update next time I can, whenever that will be I don’t know but what I do know is that thing outside isn’t human and honestly I don’t even think we’re even in our world anymore so if this reaches anybody please help comment suggestions we really need them.

1o0gmb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1o0gmb2/investigate_if_the_best_builtin_dishwasher_bosch/,Investigate if the best built-in dishwasher Bosch SHE53B75UC lives up to the hype,"Bosch SHE53B75UC has been a game-changer in my day-to-day routine. As someone who has juggled clunky dishwashers over the years, I’ll admit this one got my attention in ways most appliances don’t. From its 24-inch stainless steel build to its sleek design and advanced features, it feels like a dishwasher that belongs in a tech enthusiast’s kitchen arsenal. However, perfection is subjective, and while the Bosch SHE53B75UC performs well in many aspects, there are still a few hiccups to note.

**Design and Build Quality**

This dishwasher immediately impresses with its stainless steel finish. It doesn’t just sit there—it blends into my kitchen’s modern aesthetic. The full console control style with a pocket handle provides a minimalist, sharp look. At 90 pounds, it’s heavy but solid-feeling, and its 23.54 x 22.56 x 34.06-inch dimensions fit snugly into a standard dishwasher slot. The build quality feels premium; opening and closing the door is smooth, and the components inside are well-constructed. Honestly, it gave me zero worries about durability straight out of the box.

**Ease of Use and Features**

One feature that made me almost feel spoiled is the 3rd rack. It’s ideal for cutlery and odd-shaped items that never seem to fit in regular dishwashers. The EasyGlide rack system does exactly what it promises—sliding heavy dinner plates in and out without jerks. I love the six customizable wash cycles, which cover everything from a quick rinse to a heavy-duty cycle for pots and pans. The controls, displayed via a crisp LED, are intuitive, though if you’re not tech-savvy, you might initially need to glance at the manual.

**Performance and Efficiency**

My dishes have never been cleaner, thanks to Bosch's PrecisionWash technology. Sensors and precision spray arms ensure every dish gets hit with just the right amount of water and detergent. I tested it with crusty casseroles, coffee-stained mugs, and even unspeakably grimy Tupperware. Everything emerged spotless. Another hero here is the PureDry system, delivering impressively clean dishes without a hint of moisture—no more wiping off annoying droplets after the cycle ends.

The dishwasher operates at 46 dBA, which means it’s whisper-quiet. I have it located near my living room, and even during movie nights, you barely notice it’s on. Another delightful touch is the Home Connect feature that lets me start and monitor the dishwasher through my phone. On busy weekdays, syncing appliances with tech feels ridiculously convenient.

**Boons**

- PrecisionWash ensures thorough cleaning every cycle.
- Ultra-quiet operation at 46 dBA significantly reduces background noise.
- Energy-efficient use consuming only 2.6 gallons of water per load.
- Wi-Fi compatibility via Home Connect is incredibly handy for busy households.

**Limitations**

- Some utensils still occasionally struggle to fit comfortably in the racks despite the 3rd rack design.
- Installation may be challenging for beginners, especially if you’re not well-versed in appliance setup.
- The overall price point may feel steep for users prioritizing basic features.

**Product Rivals**

Comparing this to similar built-in dishwashers on the market, I explored models in the same category like the KitchenAid KDTM354ESS and the LG LDP6810SS. While the KitchenAid offers decent cleaning power, it lags behind when it comes to advanced features like Wi-Fi connectivity and a PureDry-like drying system. The LG model puts up a good fight with its QuadWash setup, but its noise level is a bit higher than the Bosch SHE53B75UC’s calm 46 dBA. One edge the Bosch has over its competitors is its water consumption—you’ll save on utility bills without compromising performance.  

The Bosch ultimately stands out if you’re looking for an elegant, tech-forward machine that prioritizes efficiency and quiet operation.

**Price Performance**

I’d argue this dishwasher is a good example of quality matching price. While it’s priced firmly in the higher mid-range of dishwashers, the features, build quality, and seamless integration with smart systems justify the investment. If you’re like me and value appliances that feel like they’ll survive multiple years of daily abuse, the Bosch SHE53B75UC feels like a smart buy. Its energy-efficient operation and emphasis on quietness make it appealing for families and eco-conscious individuals alike.

She sighed, before lighting it and inhaling the tobacco laced fumes. In and out she breathed as her mind wandered.*

*Today was Binah's birthday. She hadn't even thought of what she would gift her.*

*These past few months with a ""more than friends"" relationship with Binah has truly been something... and yet, she didn't even know what Binah would want. The cigarette pittered out, the smoldering herbs reaching the tips of her fingers. She lit another. And another. And another. Gebura's heart began to flutter with both love and panic, as she couldn't even puzzle out a simple gift. However, if there's anything people cherish most, its a good meal and some good laughs.*

*The redhead stood up, stamping out the expired tobacco underneath her heel and entered her bedroom. After a brief moment, she left, wearing a rather cozy, brown overcoat, fit for autumn. She grabbed a bag that was slung on a coat rack and departed shortly thereafer.*

*Meanwhile, Binah was simply trembling from the evening chill and the trepidation. Nobody seemed to notice that it was her birthday. She cuddled up under her bedsheets, wondering where Gebura was, or where her gifts were. That was until a knocking was heard at her door. Gebura carefully pushed the door open, with an embarrassed red tinting her face and ears with a new hue. She had brought a cup of bergamot earl grey tea, and a very, very sweet latte for herself.*

""Hey there, old raven... I.. uhm.. happy birthday. I brought you some tea...""

*Binah peeked her head out from beneath the covers, and watched as Gebura slowly approached. Wispy bits of fog escaped her lips as the fall chill brought a fierce cold to the library. Gebura sat down upon the bedside, slowly taking off her winter coat and wrapping it around Binah. Then, she reach inside her purse, and brought out an old VHS tape.*

""It's.. I thought the gesture would be nice, since I couldn't think of anything... but this is a... it's a horror movie I always watched as a kid whenever I was angry or sad... its a little corny, but-""

""Gebura, you old wolf... just... put it on for us, won't you?"" *Binah slowly rose from beneath the covers, and carefully plucked the tea from Gebura's hand, warming herself in the herbal remedy. Gebura nodded slightly, and she produced an old CRT at the end of the bed with the Library's light. She popped the VHS out of its case, and slid it inside before fiddling around with the controls until the movie started playing.*

*Cheesy screams. Sub-par acting. Costumes with a questionable budget. Laughable scares. It all filled their minds as they CRT's wavy lines flickered occasionally. It was an old zombie movie called **Evil Dead 2**, a very old movie lost to time. The duo huddled up under the covers, with Gebura enjoying the over-sweetened coffee and Binah enjoying the tea. Gebura wrapped an arm around Binah as she was... a little bit bewildered. Binah was jumping in her seat at every terrible scare, shielding her eyes occasionally... it was strange to witness... then, as the film concluded.. Binah had a smile on her face.*

*The question remained, however.*

""Binah... have you... ever watched a movie?""

*Binah glanced up at Gebura almost longingly.* ""I... no... I haven't...""

""Well... let that be the gift I share... wait.. I.. forgot something.."" *Gebura said with a chuckle before reaching into her pocket. She pulled out two bracelets made from colored rubber bands. One was red and black, the other was black and gold.*
""I made these... it's... it's not much.. y'know.. I-I'm not the artsy sort.. try it on."" *Gebura watched and Binah slid it on, before turning her wrist around, fascinated by such a creation. Then, she suddenly grasped Gebura's scarred hand, and slowly slid the crimson bracelet around the wrist of the one she cared for so deeply.*

""They look great on us... and here I thought you weren't the sentimental type~"" *Binah teased, poking the red mist's nose with a finger.*
""Thank you... I... I don't know what to say...""
*Both of them were blushing. Eye contact became difficult to the point of them being allergic to it... then, their gaze met... they grew close. Too close.*

""Happy birthday, you old crow..""
""Mm.. yes... indeed. Thank you.""
*They gazed longingly at one another. Through one another... then their lips parted, their eyes closed... and then the door to Binah's room loudly creaked open. Angela stood there, clearly not reading the room until the last moment.*

""S-sorry... umm. I'll get back to you two.. later."" *Angela stammered before abruptly closing the door.*

*Their first kiss... stolen away. Another time I suppose.. another time.*

**Happy Birthday, Binah. Thank you for bringing us all so close together, and thank you for bringing me so many people that I can call friend. Beneath the shadow and warmth of your cloak, under the protection of your watchful gaze... we thank you, and we celebrate you.**

1o0gjij,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrioWorksUSA/comments/1o0gjij/trio_tips_a_hidden_rule_of_higher_compensation/,"TRIO TIPS: A Hidden Rule of Higher Compensation - Extras, Gifts, and Gratuities","A Brene Brown book club and a discussion with some higher up Project Managers revealed a truth to me a few years back.

**I'd always idealized $100k and up salaries as the amazing ideal of completing a Master's Level education track  & the promise that in the Midwest (specifically) didn't seem to be a promise people like me ever saw fruition of.**

However, I had always paid attention to how people who make those salaries behave, how they delegate their work, and how they handled management of a large staff of people. I knew managers at the big Uni who had 5 units of managers under them over five departments of 10-25 employees each.

And they often handed out gifts, gift cards, provided morale events, raffle items, and professional development that went above and beyond the gift bag/spa experience.

My revelation:

* **Gifts, Gratuities, and General Morale boosting efforts were often baked into those high salaries and expected that a person making said salary would be giving X portion to do so!**
* **Some high level positions DO have access to funds for these types of bonuses, gifts, and gratuities - but it really depends on the person who gets access to them and how they are planned.**

I'd always dedicated a portion of my meager earnings to buying simple gifts for staff - pizza, birthday cakes, water, coffee supplies, fruit, and candy for staff when I could. It is just gifts those actually effected my budget.

Naturally TRIO funds can't buy those nice, fun things for staff.

(And it makes you you'd wish HR would step up and go back to the fun times where we did a birthday cake or a monthly birthday-day for all staff.)

In the future:

1. Think about how to do gift cards and bonuses give to everyone on the staff - maybe provided by our local businesses and bigger stores to improve everyone's lives and drive traffic into their places of business.
2. Plan more morale events and incentivizing morale events - put the funnest people in charge. You know who they are. Find the divas. Find the karaoke people. Set up an Xbox or PlayStation by a big TV. Pop on a racing game or Dance game. (seen this work at SWASAP events. Bon Temps!)
3. Bring morale by going to BIG morale events - my big Uni threw a good party; I'll give it that. My big business job - they gave us dividends yearly on our profits.  Zoom sent me a huge box of gifts for Zooming with them. It certainly cheers up a bleak existence. How can you go big (on someone else's dime?)
4. Dream - A non-TRIO funded morale budget. I can dream. It'd be nice have HR throwing down a bit just for TRIO programs out of the pool.
5. More guidance how to responsibly use allowable Professional Development to improve morale and team bonding with TRIO funds.
6. Give everyone a chance for 1 PD travel event a year and unlimited local PD trips.

(Speaking of tips and gratuities - when using a TRIO Credit Card - your institution or state offices usually have a set amount you are allowed to tip.  Or if you have to use your own credit card and be reimbursed, you have a set amount you are allowed to tip. My BIG TIP: When you go to a big city and hand-tips are going to be a thing, make sure you have 40$ in 5s and 1s dollar bills. Back in my early days I often forgot that was a thing I'd have to do - the bell hop, the bag check, the driver, and the porter - all that jazz.) ",3,1759847784.0,TrioWorksUSA,0,1.0,False

Here’s a simple breakdown using drink comparisons. This is for beginners or anyone trying to figure out what LitRPG vibe fits them best.

1. Stat Sheet Core
Drink: Water with Electrolytes
Clean, structured, and full of visible numbers. You see the XP gain, damage stats, skill levels. Perfect if you like clarity, power scaling, and watching numbers rise.

2. Dungeon Core
Drink: Herbal Tea
Relaxing at first, but there’s danger underneath. You’re the dungeon. You build traps, raise monsters, and level up from invaders. Great for readers who like base-building and being the villain.

3. Apocalypse System Drop
Drink: Energy Drink
Earth just got an update and now everything runs on RPG mechanics. Society is crumbling. The MC is looting stores with a new fireball stat. Fast-paced, chaotic, survival-focused.

4. Isekai LitRPG
Drink: Sweet Iced Tea
Familiar and comforting. The MC is sent to a new world and becomes overpowered quickly. Sometimes they know the system inside-out. Popular for wish fulfillment and cheat-skill fantasy.

5. VRMMO or Game Tester
Drink: Sparkling Water
MC logs into a realistic VR game where the stakes get real fast. Could be stuck inside or just trying to win. Expect guild drama, glitches, and boss fights. Good for fans of immersive digital worlds.

6. Cultivation plus LitRPG
Drink: Green Tea
Slow to start but rewarding. This one blends Eastern fantasy systems like spirit roots and divine ascension with visible stats and levels. Great for people who want a deep system and massive power scaling.

7. Merchant or Crafter Sim
Drink: Warm Milk Tea
The MC isn’t a fighter. They run shops, make potions, or build weapons. It’s about quiet growth and skill mastery. Great for readers who like cozy systems and peaceful progress.

8. Meta or Comedy LitRPG
Drink: Fizzy Soda
The MC knows the rules and breaks them for fun. The story plays with tropes and might feel like a parody. For readers who want to laugh, glitch the system, or flip the genre upside down.

9. Harem Builder LitRPG
Drink: Spiked Punch
The story focuses on relationships and romance while the MC levels up. Expect multiple love interests, emotional stats, and lots of attention on character dynamics.

10. Grimdark Survival LitRPG
Drink: Black Coffee
The system is harsh and the world is worse. The MC struggles to survive and every gain costs something. Perfect for readers who want tension, pain, and serious consequences.

Summary
If you like structure and numbers, start with Stat Core or VRMMO.
If you like building or peaceful stories, try Dungeon Core or Merchant Sim.
If you want chaos or action, go with Apocalypse or Isekai.
If you want deep growth, Cultivation is the path.
If you want something weird or funny, pick Meta LitRPG.
If you want romance, Harem LitRPG is your lane.
If you want struggle and pain, Grimdark is calling your name.

Preferably something a less structured and bulky than the CP2 but not without structure, let's say semi structured. 

I'm tempted to get the Aer City Pack Pro but it's a bit too structured and professional/business like to be an all purpose bag for the park boat and trails.

1o0ggwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o0ggwz/the_bathhouse_on_lygon_street/,The Bathhouse on Lygon Street,"
When I was twenty-one years of age, I was studying biology at Cleveland State University. Upon reaching the start of the third semester, I got the opportunity to study abroad for half a year. So, due to my particular interest in Australian wildlife, I chose to travel to Melbourne. I’d whole-heartedly wish that I could say that this little story is about the many hours I spent preoccupied with the arachnids of Australia, but sadly, what I’m about to relay concerns a certain street; a certain place, much more that it does the animal kingdom.

During my time in Australia, I made quite a few good study-friends. Unsurprisingly, many of the Australian biology students shared my interests in the unique wildlife, so we started going out to cafés in the Brunswick East area a couple times a week. Mostly, we’d discuss matters relating to biology, chemistry and the like, but when the evenings dragged out, we could easily find our way into the territory of myth and fiction. 

The group, enjoying my ignorance regarding Australian culture and myths, would often tell me all sorts of stories. Stories of strange beings lurking in the wilderness. The Bunyip, the Dropbear. Even something about a rivermonster called a Muldjewangk. I didn’t know how much of it was actual folklore, and how much of it they just made up on the spot, but we got quite a few good laughs out of speculating about how these creatures might possibly function from a biological standpoint.

There was this one time however, about halfway through the semester, in which Emily, one of the Australian students, told me of a myth that ended up sticking with me. Not concerning a cryptid this time, but instead, a strange door. She told me that, every now and then, a rainy, yet cloudless night would take place. When that happened, a small blue door with a crescent moon engraved could be found between two, seemingly random cafés on Lygon Street. She referred to it as the Lygon Street Bathhouse.

I have to admit, at the time of the conversation, I was not all that engaged. I did not ask any elaborating questions, because I did not care about the small blue door. I would much rather be discussing weird creatures. Still though, it rained later that same night, and the idea of the Lygon Street Bathhouse ended up festering itself in my dreams.

-

The remainder of the semester flew by, and by the time that I was about to go back to America, I had largely forgotten about the bathhouse, safe for the occasional rainy night, in which the dreams would return without fail. It would always look the same. Small, spa-like atmosphere. Hazy, the air filled with the smell of sweet fruits, and the ground and walls covered in small, white tiles. Never did I make it all too far from the blue door with the little crescent moon, before waking up again.

In the final week, something that I still struggle to explain happened. Me and the others had spent the afternoon out as usual, mostly polishing the last assignment of the semester. We left early that day, as we could see the drops of rain hitting the pavement outside, and we did not want to walk back in that weather. It was not until around ten o’clock that I noticed it. Yes, I could not possibly be mistaken. There was not as much as a single cloud in the sky.

I texted Emily about it, but she seemed to hardly care at all. “I was just pulling your leg. I made the whole thing up at the café.” Emily said. “There is no bathhouse on Lygon Street”. Now, me, being the reasonable young man that I was, believed her. I already had the feeling that she had made it up back at the café, and there was little chance that such an odd tale was a known Australian myth. The rain could simply be a product of highly uniform clouds, so identical, and so dark, that it simply looked like a clear sky.

If it had been nearly any other night, I would have stayed at home, likely having yet another strange dream about the bathhouse, but this being one of my last nights in Australia, I felt compelled to at least go and check, just to be sure. So four Australian dollars, and a ten-minute bus ride later, I found myself standing at the south end of Lygon Street.

I had been to Lygon Street multiple times during my stay in Australia, and even though it was late, it wasn’t usually this empty. There were people around, but only very few, and most of them looked as though they simply wanted to hurry home, which, I suppose, is to be expected in this weather.

I walked up and down the street a few times, keeping my eyes peeled for the blue door with the crescent moon symbol, but, despite making the trip five-or-so times, there were no such door to be found between any of the many cafés.

Suddenly, though, I managed to catch a glimpse of the moons’ reflection in a small puddle that had formed on the ground. It captivated me, because I quickly noticed that it wasn’t behaving as one may expect. You see, despite the fact that drops were falling into the puddle at a near constant pace, the ripples made no disturbance on the reflection whatsoever! 

I looked for minutes, trying to figure out what was happening, when all of a sudden, a deep blue started to form around the reflection of the moon. It twisted and contorted in wild spiral motions, until at last, it came to a halt. Now, in the puddle, were the reflection of a small, blue door, with the crescent moon centered right in the middle. I looked up, and sure enough, there it was. Right between two unassuming cafés stood the small blue door, and above it hung the sign. ‘Lygon Street Bathhouse’.

I was hesitant at first. Despite the fact that I had made the journey out here, I didn’t believe I would actually find it. But it was undeniable. The door was truly there. I could touch it. I could grab the handle, and after weighing what to do for a couple seconds, that is exactly what I did. 

-

In a strange mix of both surprise and the lack thereof, I found that the room I entered was exactly like the one that had been making  regular appearances in my dream since I first heard about this place. Everything was as it had been in the dreams. The polished, white tiles that covered the walls and floor. The all-encompassing fog. The sweet scent of fruit permeating my nostrils. Almost out of instinct, I questioned if I was dreaming. It had been such a regular experience that I expected to wake up any minute now, but I did not.

I walked into the hazy fog, as per usual, but I found that I was now able to continue beyond the brink that would otherwise have woken me up had this been but another dream. Filled with this strange excitement, I continued on.

Despite my vision being heavily obscured by the fog, I made my way further in. Following the sweet fruit-like scent, I eventually stumbled upon a large bath from which a lot of this fog seemed to be arising. The water had a pinkish hue, and as I reached out to touch it, I found that it had a comfortable, warm temperature too. It was here that I noticed someone standing on the other side of the bath. From what I could deduct from the silhouette, it was a small, middle-aged man. Had I seen that guy before?

I walked a little closer, and suddenly I realized. It was the waiter. The waiter from the café that me and the others had been to earlier today! I did not know his name, but yes, it was certainly him. I called out to him, asking for help to navigate this place, but he seemed to hardly notice me. He just kept wandering around aimlessly. I went a little closer, so as to reach out for him, but just as I got close enough to touch his shoulder, I noticed that something was horribly wrong with his face. 

His eyes were missing. His teeth, too. His mouth was half open, and his drool was slowly dripping out on the floor beneath him. How could this be?! He was wearing the exact same clothes as he had been wearing earlier that very same day! He did not otherwise look hurt or anything. He just moved about, slowly, silently. Shortly thereafter, he disappeared back into the fog.

The scent of the fruit suddenly took on a more acidic feel, almost stinging my nostrils as I breathed. I started backtracking, attempting to find the blue door so that I could get back out. Eventually, I did reach the room that I had originally entered, but there was no exit to be found. The wall which had originally held the door now opened up into yet another room with a large, centered bath.

I frantically made my way from room to room. Occasionally, I would see people wandering blindly down the many halls and rooms, all leaving trails of drool wherever they went. Most of the people I did not recognize, but some of them I did. People who I remember seeing, sitting and enjoying a coffee outside on a cool autumn day. Now they were here. 

After running around for what was likely minutes, but felt like hours, I thought I saw the blue door in the distance. I walked closer, and yes, there it was, finally! But just as I was making my way across that final, hazy room, I felt a soft, small hand place itself weakly upon my shoulder. 

I turned around, and to my horror, I saw that it was Emily. Emily, who, just earlier tonight, had texted me that the bathhouse was a myth that she had made up on the spot. Her eyes and teeth were missing, and she looked horribly malnourished. She appeared to be trying very hard to speak, but all she could produce were faint gurgling noises as drool poured from her mouth. I took a few hasty steps back, but as I did, I suddenly slipped on the wet tiles. The last thing I remember was the sudden bang of my head hitting the tiling. 

-

When I came to, I was no longer in the bathhouse. I was just laying there, on the street outside. The sun had risen, and I could feel the cool morning wind blow over my ears. I felt freezing and concussed, though I did not appear to be bleeding. As I sat up, I saw that I was laying right beside that puddle. Right between the two cafés. The blue door, however, was nowhere to be seen.

I texted the group as soon as I got home, about whether we could meet up, because I had something to share. We met at our usual spot in Brunswick East. The waiter came with our food, as always. The very same waiter that I had seen just last night. He looked fine, but as I started telling the story, I could see that he was paying full attention from the side. The others laughed it off, joking that I may have had a tad too much to drink last night, and must have fainted out in the street. Emily, however, didn’t say a word throughout the entire thing.

I cannot help but think that there is someone, something, wearing my appearance, that now, too, blindly roams the hazy halls of the bathhouse on Lygon Street.

1o0gei5,https://i.redd.it/1tnbqrz39ptf1.jpeg,10-day water fast – My short diary,"Hey folks! I recently completed a **10-day water fast**, and this time I kept a running diary (a really short one). Though it’s not an IF experience, I thought it might still be interesting for the community, so I wanted to share it here.

**New ideas for this fast**

* I don’t have much extra weight, so my focus was on the **general health benefits** of fasting and solidifying my habits.
* I picked warm summer days - and wow, fasting in the heat turned out to be a great idea (except for one brutally stressful day 7).
* I tried to keep my daily routine as normal as possible instead of lying around. The goal was to accomplish as much as possible while fasting, and it turned out really well.
* Another thing - I tried to make fasting not the main event. I distracted myself with bigger goals so I wasn’t obsessing over food all the time - another thing that helped a lot.

**Preparation: Days -2 and -1**

* **Day -2:** Hosted a BBQ with friends. I intentionally overate to “build hate” toward food. Odd strategy, but it worked surprisingly well.
* **Day -1:** Played soccer and kept meals light.

**Day 1 – Monday**

* Slept great — I was super excited to start my fast.
* Coffee with heavy cream at 7 am, and my fast officially began.
* Did a **DEXA scan** right after starting; those results are always a huge motivator.
* It was also my **18th wedding anniversary**. My wife wasn’t exactly thrilled to celebrate with just water, but hey, love is about compromise.
* To speed up ketosis (and avoid the dreaded day 3 crash), I went all-in at the gym: cycling (11 mins, level 12), running (35 mins at 7 mph), steam room — burned about 720 calories.
* My staples: Ultima electrolytes (2–3 packets/day), hot water with pink salt, and San Pellegrino (one 750 ml bottle).

**Day 2 – Tuesday**

* First calf cramps — gone after electrolytes.
* Gym: cycling (10 mins), strength training (40 mins at \~60% load), steam room.
* Kept reminding myself: this fast isn’t about “surviving.” It’s about using 10 days to actually **get stuff done**.

**Day 3 – Wednesday**

* Slept unbelievably deep — so deep it was hard to wake up. Probably from cutting coffee (black coffee tastes awful to me).
* Realization: fasting in **summer is way nicer than winter**, even in California.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (35 mins at 6 mph), steam room.
* Eyes started feeling tired quickly, slight vision deterioration.

**Day 4 – Thursday**

* More calf cramps.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), strength training (35 mins), steam room.
* First tiny bowel movement since starting the fast.

**Day 5 – Friday**

* Resting heart rate dropped to **41**, impressive. My all time low was 38, but it was like 10 years ago.
* Big realization: poor sleep during my previous fasts wasn’t from physical stress, but **mental stress about fasting itself**. This time, I felt relaxed, slept well, and that made fasting much easier during the daytime.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (20 mins at 5.4 mph), steam room.

**Day 6 – Saturday**

* Night heart rate: 42. Another great night of sleep.
* No workouts — spent the day at my son’s soccer tournament in **95°F heat**. Brutal.
* Eyes irritated from the dry air, even with glasses. Felt drained all day.

**Day 7 – Sunday**

* Morning calf cramps again — fixed with electrolytes.
* **The hardest day**: another full day at my son’s tournament in 95°F. My glucose dropped to 41 (quickly rebounded to 60). Ketones hit **7.4**, my all-time high at that time.
* Just to stress me out further, I read a Reddit post about someone ending up in the ER with gallbladder issues during fasting. Exactly what I didn’t need to read.
* Eyes still irritated.
* Pool time with my family saved the day — cooling down helped a lot.

**Day 8 – Monday**

* Morning cramps again; electrolytes did their job, but only partially.
* Eyes still itchy, but eye drops helped.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (15 mins at 5.2 mph). Energy was definitely low.
* Another tiny bowel movement.
* Ultima electrolytes officially became disgusting — every flavor.

**Day 9 – Tuesday**

* Morning cramps again, this time not fully gone with electrolytes.
* Took it easy — my ketones were still at **7.9** in the morning.

**Day 10 – Wednesday**

* Same morning cramps.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (20 mins at 5.2 mph), steam room.

**Refeed: Day 1 – Thursday**

* Morning cramps again. Electrolytes, again.
* Did a **DEXA scan, full blood panel, and epigenetic clock**. Then I was ready to break my longest fast so far.
* Broke the fast with **boiled broccoli and bone broth**. Oh, those wild broccolli-and-bone-broth post-fast parties!
* Actually, I was a bit nervous about starting to eat again — it felt unusual at first, but the feeling passed quickly.
* Later: coffee with heavy cream (finally!) and more broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and a little cheese. Felt amazing.

**Refeed: Day 2 – Friday**

* Cramps still hanging around.
* First real bowel movement — volume, timing, everything felt back to normal.
* Eyes improved noticeably.
* Eating almost normally but chewing every bite very carefully.

**Refeed: Day 3 – Saturday**

* Eating close to normal.
* In the evening, went to a party. Sampled a bit of everything (classic Eastern European potluck where everyone brings enough food for 20 people) and even had a little beer. Felt great.

**Refeed: Day 4 – Sunday**

* Back to regular food intake. Zero sugar cravings, which is always a win.
* First strength workout post-fast — kept it light to avoid injuries.

**Refeed: Day 5 – Monday**

* Regular cardio: cycling (10 mins, level 12), running (30 mins up to 8 mph), steam room.
* Officially done with “careful monitoring.” Back to normal eating and training!

**Summary & Takeaways**

* **Easiest fast I’ve ever done** — mentally and physically.
* **Most efficient refeed** I’ve had — the transition back to food was smooth.
* Lost **15.5 lbs total**, including about **5.5 lbs of fat**.
* Next focus: start building muscles - my new learning frontier!",10,1759847465.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.86,False

1o0gcm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0gcm1/seattle_wa/,"📍 Seattle, WA","Closest Airports: Seattle–Tacoma International (SEA), Paine Field (PAE)

Seattle’s golf scene is built for players who appreciate nature and nuance. The region’s public golf ranges from links-style layouts near the Puget Sound to parkland classics tucked under towering evergreens. In summer, you’ll find 16 hours of daylight — perfect for squeezing in a replay round or an extended 19th hole session at a local brewery.

**When to Go**

May through September is prime. Expect highs in the 70s, low humidity, and long daylight. Spring and fall can be beautiful too, though the Pacific Northwest drizzle returns — bring rain gear just in case. Winters are playable but wet, and many courses go to “winter rules.”

**Must Plays (click to upvote if you'd recommend)**

* [Chambers Bay ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0g7c7/chambers_bay/)– The bucket-list U.S. Open venue on the Puget Sound; pure links golf, walking only.
* [The Home Course](https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0g86t/the_home_course/) – Just down the road from Chambers, more forgiving and equally scenic.
* [Gold Mountain (Olympic Course)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0g8ui/gold_mountain_olympic_course/) – A Pacific Northwest classic with tree-lined beauty and tournament pedigree.
* [Salish Cliffs Golf Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0g9d2/salish_cliffs_golf_club/) – A stunning, secluded resort course owned by the Squaxin Island Tribe, known for its elevation and service.
* [Washington National](https://www.reddit.com/r/BirdieBoundTrips/comments/1o0g9wx/washington_national_golf_club/) – Home of UW Husky Golf, with a fun, bold design that’s group-friendly and accessible.

**Best Bang for Your Buck**

The Home Course and Gold Mountain are both tremendous values — championship-level design and conditions at everyday-play prices.

**Trip Vibe**

Seattle trips are all about variety and scenery. Groups often base in the city for nightlife and food, then venture out to Chambers Bay or Bremerton for day trips. It’s a great destination for players who enjoy both golf and exploration — think ferry rides, microbreweries, and hikes mixed with 36-hole days.

**Dining & Nightlife**

Seattle is foodie heaven: fresh seafood (especially salmon and oysters), craft beer, and top-tier coffee everywhere. Neighborhoods like Ballard, Capitol Hill, and Belltown bring nightlife and live music, while Tacoma offers a relaxed, brewery-centric vibe for post-golf hangs.

**Other Tips**

Bring layers — mornings can be cool even in July. Chambers Bay requires walking (with optional caddie), so be ready for a workout. Early tee times mean softer greens and fewer coastal winds.

Seattle’s golf scene is equal parts tranquil and challenging — the perfect mix of links golf, pine-lined classics, and laid-back Northwest charm.

Then she told me her marriage was not great, her husband didn’t love her etc 
She felt lost and unwanted and was getting divorced.
I liked her and having recently faced the loss of my wife it was nice to be able to laugh again.
What I didn’t realise was her husband didn’t know about some of our meetings.
the friendship grew and I was asked to do favours for her which I didn’t mind as I liked her a lot in fact fell in love with her.
But then things took a serious turn when she decided to spend quite a lot of money on a car without her husband knowing and bought furniture and asked me to store it for her.
I started to realise I was being used and felt a bit sick.
I tried to speak about it and realised I wasn’t the only ‘coffee’ buddy in her life and perhaps one was more than that.
I was really annoyed with myself for not realising sooner I was being taking advantage of.
I met her parents and they are lovely people and I’m sure they are unaware of her behaviour.
Anyway now she doesn’t speak to me and I returned her stuff and I’m the ‘enemy’ even though I would have done anything for her and if she wanted a relationship with me post divorce we could have seen how it went.
It’s awkward as we are neighbours.

We chatted on Seeking then switched to texting. In the texting, we discussed the allowance of XXXX per month for specific number dates and she agreed and we met the next day for coffee then had lunch and we talked about everything and went very well. We talked about booking a hotel and  meeting privately. I gifted her a pair sunglasses since it was our first date (she did not ask me though) and also gave her $50 to her and again she did not ask for it but I gave .Per the agreement, I am supposed to pay her on 15th and 30th of every month but I said I can be flexible. We kissed and left.

We met the second day again for coffee at Starbucks and chatted for 2 hours then kissed and said bye.

We met a day after for lunch and talked about booking the hotel this week and talked about other stuff. I gave her $50 again. This is not in our agreement though.

Over the weekend I booked the hotel and called her then she said I am not ready for it yet and getting cold feet etc etc. I kind of got angry and said Goodbye then she was saying Is it all about sex blah blah. It looks like that night she got brainwashed by her friend like asking for allowance without having sex and definitely her friend played a role in her.

We met again yesterday for coffee and she said she is not ready but wants her allowance to start coming if I care for her and saying that sex will happen at some point when she is ready. Yesterday She herself asked for money this time and I felt bad but gave her $25.

I met her on seeking and it implies sex at some point and we kissed all 4 times and she says she likes me but backing out and wants allowance. The only mistake I made was saying goodbye prematurely but I don't think it is a big deal because we became good friends. Infact I was consoling her last week and talked for long when she was having issues with her to be EX husband.

I don't want to start an allowance because she keeps changing her words about meeting in private even after 4 coffee/lunch dates and Now she is back on seeking. Should I stick to my words that I start an allowance only after seeing her in private?

I didn’t want to go through the whole bake in the oven routine, so I started throwing things together without really expecting much. Somehow, I ended up making what might be the best quick keto bread I’ve ever had and it happened completely by accident

I measured it just to share properly   
1 large egg, about 3 tablespoons of almond flour, a small pinch of baking powder, and about a tablespoon of shredded mozzarella. I added a splash of olive oil and a pinch of salt. I mixed everything together until it looked like thick batter kind of like pancake mix.

I poured it into a greased mug and microwaved it for about 90 seconds. When it came out, it looked like a little spongey bun. I sliced it in half, put some butter in a pan, and toasted each side until golden. It smelled amazing, like real toast.

I topped it with mashed avocado and a fried egg, and I swear it felt like eating an actual breakfast sandwich. The texture was fluffy inside and crispy on the outside  not eggy, not soggy, just right. I checked the carbs, and it’s roughly around 3g net carbs for the whole thing, which is totally keto friendly.

It was one of those I didn’t plan this but now I’m definitely making it again kind of moments. I honestly just love when keto recipes surprise you like this. If anyone tries it or tweaks it maybe adds herbs or cheese on top, share with me  I’m excited  how it turns out for others too.",49,1759847123.0,ketorecipes,14,0.92,False

1o0g1yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1o0g1yz/why_do_they_do_this/,Why do they do this.,"After explaining to one customer that no, there aren’t any nuts in a vanilla latte, and explaining to another that yes, you can put cream in an americano, I had this exchange:

Customer: hi, I’m not sure what I want

Me: no worries, take your time. 

Customer: no, like, I know what I *want*, I just don’t know what it’s called. 

Me: ok, well if you describe it to me maybe I can help you figure it out. 

Customer: that’d be great. *silence*

Me: ……….

Me: …so go ahead and describe it whenever you’re ready. 

Customer: so I want something with, like, coffee and milk. 

Me: like… coffee with milk added?

Her: no, regular coffee is too acidic. 

Me: ok, well, cold brew is going to be less acidic, so that could be it?

Customer: no, what I want is a hot drink. 

Me: ok, so like a Cafe Au Lait? *explains what a cafe au lait is*

Customer: no, that sounds too acidic. 

Me: ….do you mean a latte?

Customer: yes! That’s it. But can you make that without sugar?

Me: *points to latte description on the menu right in front of her, trying not to sound too annoyed* so, if you check out our menu, it has a description of what goes into our drinks. 

Customer: *looking at me instead of the menu* okay?

Me: …so it says here what goes into a latte is just espresso and steamed milk. 

Customer: that’s perfect. 

I cannot emphasize enough: this woman spoke fluent English and looked like she was at least 30. There was a line. I really don’t know why we had to play a guessing game, and I don’t know why she refused to read the menu, but I do know it’s one of the more annoying interactions I’ve had at work in recent memory. 

Edit: some of y’all are weird. Sure, I suppose I met the only visibly wealthy, functionally illiterate woman who happened to be carrying a magazine that she couldn’t read for a friend that I’ve ever encountered in my life today, but somehow I doubt it. ",140,1759846673.0,barista,51,0.95,False

1o0g1lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenTamplinEXPOSED/comments/1o0g1lo/new_in_town/,New in Town,"Background: I went to high school with Ken’s kids. His son True was in my class. He was conventionally attractive and had this almost cult-like following especially around Young Life and the church he got other kids into. Attractive, wealthy white kids, specifically. I left the area after high school and came back once a few years later. His son was in the same coffee shop doing the same, I don’t know, scammy kind of life-coaching or religious youth counseling that he’d done in high school. He also, weirdly, dated a girl significantly younger than him for several years. Like she was 15 when he was 18, kind of thing. 

Anyway, I’ve recently been getting instagram ads for Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy. And it reminded me the one (count 1) singular time I met Ken and his wife and they both made sure everyone in the room knew that he’d been vetted and asked to tour with Journey. Ken, however, graciously after much prayer, turned down the contract to be with his young children and wife, as that’s where God had called him. This was all in his own words. 

Since high school, I’ve seen his son self-publish some scammy looking book on Amazon about being a Christ-like entrepreneur or something (I’m sure you’re all aware), and I’m always reminded of how deeply uncomfortable that singular interaction with Ken and his wife was. He needed everyone to know. When I thought to look him up many months after, I was deeply underwhelmed. Maybe he’s just not my style, but the prospect of Neal Schon hearing that and thinking, “this is the man to take up Steve Perry’s mantle,” seems… insane, to be quite honest. 

The entire family feels like they’d start a cult if they could, and maybe that’s just because their overtly Christian beliefs seems like it gives them (Ken and True, specifically) a superiority complex that I cannot comprehend because I see mediocrity at best from both of them. 

Can anyone explain what the hell is going on here?

I was just sitting here drinking my Teeccino and thought I would share.

There are other dandelion chicory tea brands as well, I suppose this is just a more well-known one. Tastes like coffee though, no caffeine, no acid, and has some potassium. It helps my PVCs calm down sometimes when they are really active, which they have been the past couple days after a wonderful week and a half stretch of inactivity. Ugh.
