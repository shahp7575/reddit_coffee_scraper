ES - RSI 2 - skip any trades when volatility high , sell when close < prior high 

CL : exponential ma - find by grid search - when short is over long go long - sell when trailing atr 14 \* 3 is hit 

KC: same 

GC: seasonal - buy Thursday close sell monday open 

  
combine all 4 into 1x portfolio <--- allow simultaneous trades on all 4 - so can be long / short multiple   
also - CL and KC - find 'stable' parameters in the grid search result matrix

Known for its 50-oz capacity and double-wall insulated stainless steel design, it immediately caught my eye because of its promises of durability and efficient brewing. After pouring numerous cups of coffee with this French press, I’ve compiled my personal thoughts, experiences, and observations for anyone contemplating adding it to their kitchen arsenal.

**Sleek and Practical Design**

The design of this product is stylish yet highly functional, with its matte black exterior giving it an elegant touch. The vacuum-layered, double-wall construction isn’t just there for show—it retains heat significantly better than most other coffee makers I’ve tried. Whether it’s early morning or a lazy Sunday afternoon, the coffee stays hot for a surprisingly long time. The cool-touch handle prevents any accidental burns, which is a lifesaver when you’re still half-asleep and fumbling for caffeine. 

[Grab Belwares BW-50FPC at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01h2dyiuk/)

**The Coffee Brewing Experience**

Brewing coffee with this French press feels seamless thanks to its simplicity. Adding coarsely ground coffee and pouring in hot water is all it takes. The manual operation might take a bit of elbow grease to push the plunger, but this little bit of effort yields rich, aromatic coffee. I’ve even tested it to prepare tea and froth milk, and it handled these tasks smoothly, proving itself as a versatile brewing companion. Producing eight cups of coffee (4 oz per cup) within five minutes? That’s a win for busy mornings! 

**Highlights**

- Made with sturdy, BPA-free 304-grade stainless steel.  
- Double-wall design keeps the coffee hot longer than most glass French presses.  
- Multi-functional for brewing tea, making iced beverages, and even creating frothy milk.  

**Filtration That Makes a Difference**

Its 4-level filtration system is touted as a standout feature, and I have to agree—it delivers. Unlike many other French presses, this one does an excellent job of catching even the tiniest coffee grounds. Cleaning the filter screen is relatively hassle-free, though not being dishwasher-compatible means all parts must be hand-washed. It’s a small trade-off for consistently smooth, ground-free coffee.

**Areas for Improvement**

Anyone who’s brewed coffee knows it’s not a perfect science, and even so, the product has its quirks.  
- The plunger occasionally feels stiff, particularly during the first few uses.  
- Cleaning the filter screens, though easy, can be tedious if you’re someone who relies heavily on dishwashers.  
- Despite being durable, the exterior is prone to fingerprints, which can mar its otherwise sleek look.

**Competing Products**

While the Belwares French press is impressive in many respects, a fair comparison to its competitors helps set expectations. The Bodum Chambord French Press and Frieling Double Wall Stainless Steel French Press are popular alternatives. Compared to the Bodum Chambord, Belwares offers better heat retention due to its double-wall construction. However, Bodum’s design is lighter and possibly a better fit for people preferring a minimalistic glass look. Against the Frieling model, Belwares is more affordable but lacks the dishwasher-safe cleaning option Frieling provides. 

Ultimately, the Belwares press finds its niche among users seeking durability and heat retention at a reasonable price.

**Worth Every Penny**

Talking about price-to-quality ratio, this French press delivers solid value. With its robust design, superior filtration, and multiple functions packed into one coffee maker, it’s hard to argue against its affordability. The added bonus of two extra filters and a warranty sweetens the deal further. While it might not be the absolute cheapest option, the features and durability more than make up for the slight premium.

The confusing part is, I know she’s dating someone. And when I’ve asked her out, she’s said no.

I’m from a different country and culture, so probably there wouldn’t be future between us

She also gets weirdly jealous—like if I flirt with other girls around the café, she blocks it or interrupts somehow.

One more thing—she knows I briefly dated another barista here about a year ago, and it didn’t last long. She once joked that I just like to play with girls.

I'm nearly 40 years old and I find it hard to talk to women in person. I often feel shy and not sure what to say. About 2 months ago I started to get into findom and have been silently sending. Not a whole lot, usually enough for a coffee or to cover a dinner, but I loved the way it felt when I did. It was like a warm embrace. Usually it was only a few times a week after I finished my workout at the gym, but lately each day I've woken up and first thing I do is scroll to find someone who's aesthetic I like and I can make their day a bit brighter.

There's been some dommes I've seen that are honestly take your breath away beautiful, and it feels good to send to them on more than one occasion, but I would really like to reach out to them and maybe get to know them better, but I always find it super intimidating. Not intimidating in the the way of they are mean and scary, but more along the lines of like them being on another level and way more important than my attention. Sometimes this is dommes with lots of followers but it happens with not as popular dommes too. I've tried before to type up a message to them, but I get so nervous and excited at the same time that my hands literally start shaking.

Even before I knew what it was called, I've always been a bit submissive (and in the last few years started to enjoy my feminine side more), so my sexual experience isn't the best. That also worries me when talking to a domme. I'd love to have and hold an actual conversation but I'm worried that I, well to put it nicely, wouldn't last long.

I'm curious if you guys have any advice or tips to help get over this anxious and nervousness?",3,1746821211.0,paypigsupportgroup,3,1.0,False

What suggestions would you pass on to other men (or women to men)?,"I'm just curious what other men's dating app experiences are?

Also, happy for women to comment on their experiences and perhaps their suggestions for men who they may think need suggestions.

I'm new to dating apps this year.  
I had always managed to meet a reasonably good match via my travels or work.  
But my last relationship went negatively, and was my first negative relationship experience, and going into my 30s I suddenly feel like I can't waste time in moving onto the next stage of my life with a future wife and having children.  
And my career has been a success, which is nice, but also now I no longer have the opportunities to meet people the way I used to.

So I turned to dating apps.

I immediately hated tinder... I can't put my finger on precisely why. I used it for a day and deleted it.

I added Bumble. I put up photos that I thought were a reasonable representation of myself.  
A clear profile photo that showed my face clearly. (including haircut because I feel this can be an indication of character type).  
I'm very into fitness, so a photo that shows my physique, not to sexualise myself, but to show that it's a part of my lifestyle.  
I have a couple of doggos, so a photo with them.  
I enjoy a nice view and a glass of wine, so a photo that captures both and shows a snippet of my lifestyle.  
And I dress (so I'm told) nicely, so a full body view photo with me wearing something typical to what I'll go into the city in.

I try to summarise myself as aptly as possible.  
I start with my job - I'm a tiny bit vague about it, but the idea is expressed.  
Then a snippet of my origins through to my educational pathway.  
Then I add a little about my character traits. I am quite clear on those.  
Then I add exactly what I want/am looking for.

I am a fairly attractive guy, 5'10"", and on the surface a little bit of a cliche. White, blue eyes, works in finance.

I swipe left on probably 95%-97% of women.  
Initial criteria is that I want to find the woman attractive. She doesn't need to be stunning. Just conventionally attractive.  
But if they pass the visual match, then I do actually read their profile. If they don't have traits or their photos don't show traits that I don't think will match up, I'll swipe left.  
I only swipe right on what I think will be the best overall compatibility.

In the last 2 months that I've been using it, I've been on 12 dates.  
I never cross over the dates. I talk to multiple at once via the app but only plan one date at a time. In person so far, none have met my criteria besides one.  
That one was somewhat daunted by the lifestyle I floated as an offer if we worked out. Which was a shame, but I didn't push it.

I would say that overall, so far, my experience using Bumble has been positive.

I have another date from it planned next weekend. I met her very briefly for a coffee last week in a different city that I was passing through, and I'm flying her to me this time for a date.

I presently have about 900 ""likes you"" that fall outside my filters.

Hallo!~


Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You’re introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let’s chat. No rush—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

If you’re looking for a loyal, drama-free connection (and someone to steal hoodies from), DM me. Let’s trade stories and playlists first.

I'm not looking to rush things, I want to make that connection, it's more than just a spark. ",1,1746820429.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I've been trying to land an internship for months but keep getting rejected because my resume is basically just my education and that one time I helped my cousin set up his website.

Here's my situation...I don't have fancy technical skills or impressive projects to show off, but I'm willing to work my ass off to learn. I'm talking staying late, doing the coffee runs, taking notes, whatever it takes. I just need someone to give me that first chance.

I'm starting to wonder if companies even take on complete beginners anymore? Like, isn't the whole point of an internship supposed to be learning on the job? I'm not expecting to be handed anything - I genuinely want to contribute and prove myself useful.

Has anyone managed to break into their field with literally zero experience? Did you have to do something creative to get noticed? Or know of companies that actually train interns from scratch?

At this point I'm open to any advice that doesn't involve ""just build an impressive portfolio"" because that's the Catch-22 I'm stuck in!

The confusing part is, I know she’s dating someone. And when I’ve asked her out, she’s said no.

I’m from a different country and culture, so probably there wouldn’t be future between us

She also gets weirdly jealous—like if I flirt with other girls around the café, she blocks it or interrupts somehow.

One more thing—she knows I briefly dated another barista here about a year ago, and it didn’t last long. She once joked that I just like to play with girls.

I know that every logo should be fresh and unique and similarities to other brands in the same industry should be avoided at all costs, but surely overlaps will happen no matter how much due diligence is done by the designer, especially now when there's such a trend towards minimalism.   
  
Every logo I design I feel like I need to reinvent the wheel to make absolutely sure there is no other mark like it anywhere in the world. Is this unnecessary or is it ok for two businesses to have a similar logo if one is a company that sells lightbulbs in the UK and the other is a coffee shop in Japan?  

I see new businesses pop up all the time with super simple logos and think to myself - surely there's another business out there with the exact same logo. For example, I came across a brand called Seed that sells probiotics, their logo is literally a solid white circle. 

Apologies if this is something that's been asked before (no doubt it has), I did search the sub for similar posts but couldn't find anything. I'm not a complete newbie to design, but I'm self-taught and still learning. If someone could clear this up for me I'd really appreciate it. Thanks",1,1746820093.0,graphic_design,1,1.0,False

I run an average of 7 miles a day on top of my work out and eat well. Stopped drinking. Really only drink water with a 0 calorie/sugar flavor packet. Took on a resourceful role of shop steward at work and I have a good reputation with people there. They've asked me to step up to the next higher position. I'm more confident most the time than I used to be. I control my emotions. Reddit is the only social media account I have. I have a good job. I have a house of my own. I have 2 motorcycles (1 I'm going to sell) and a car. I'm 26 years old. I have a pretty healthy retirement plan on track. I've built everything I have in life with schooling and landing a great job. I know I'm not bad looking. Everyone In my circle constantly checks up on if I'm seeing anyone yet. Some actually saying and trying to hook me up with someone. Or being a wannabe wingman when we're out. 

Just met this amazing girl over a work trip. Couldn't get her off my mind and still can't from the moment I met her. We had lingering smiles and stares throughout the trip. Some great laughs and banter. Some great little convos. But the work came first so we used the time we had is all. Then on the last night. Right before I was about to ask her to have some drinks. She asked me. We met at 8p. We talked and laughed and had an amazing time until they told us the bar was closed and only then we realized it was midnight. Not a single moment. Not single awkward silence whole night. She had to be up for an earlier flight than me so she was in rush to get some sleep. But we talked on her rooms floor for a bit. Exchanged numbers. I asked her if I could take her out to dinner soon and she said yes. She made my heart feel full again. Like it was the first time. Like all my insecurities washed away. Like I have stronger feelings for her than even back in high school crushing days. Of course I haven't told her these things yet. 
I texted her, and next day she texted back nothing short. 3 little paragraphs and engaging in the chat. I matched the energy and didn't hear from her for the next day. That was the only text she's sent. The day after that, I texted her, (here's the short version), ""I want to talk more about this in person or over the phone. But I don't want to wait too long without saying either. I think you're amazing, and you haven't left my mind. I don't do casual. I want a life partner. I want you. Don't feel any pressure or expectation. I'm not asking for anything right now and you don't need to answer to this. Ill respect whatrver your decision. But I wanted to tell you where I stand and what I'm looking for."" And asked her out for dinner again at the end of the text. 
She's read it. This was 2-1/2 days ago. After all that chemistry we shared. And this is it? After the bar I felt like she was the one. I was planning on making a big show for her on our dinner. In short, I play guitar and wanted to make a testament of my affection for her. Prove I'm all in. 

It's just frustrating. Yeah maybe she's busy. Maybe something came up. Maybe she's thinking it all over. Maybe I somehow scared her off. I just don't get it. Debating on sending another text when it's been a week. But leaning more on just letting it be. She read it. She knows. Nothing more I can say I guess. 


I've occasionally asked or wrote my number or asked to dinner to a couple girls I got along with just at coffee shops or whatever. Everyone's already seeing someone. Common response. Then one girl, her and I got along great. She'd legit skip to the counter when I came in and wave and give a cheery hi, and we'd ask about each other's day. After a few of these visits. I grew some balls to ask her to dinner. Everything changed. She said she was already seeing someone. I said that it's okay. But she never spoke with me again. When id come in. She'd go to the back and have someone else take the order. Within 2 weeks I didn't even see her working there anymore. 
Like what in the hell am I doing wrong here? I'm a nice guy. Everyone knows me as such. People come up to me for help. I'm approachable. I talk with everyone. CO worker legit snuck a picture of me the other day and commented how it's the only time he's seen me without a smile, cause I was going through my emails on my phone. 
It's just. Discouraging. And driving me nuts. 

There was another girl a few years ago that we were both pretty crazy for each other after meeting online. FaceTime. Texting all the time. I dropped her food off at work. We hugged and almost kissed there. We were planning a hang out. Then she blocked me on everything out of nowhere. I went to her work. Saw her car out front. Went in. She wasnt up front. When I asked for her, girl said she wasn't here. I got the message. Let her be.

So far. Every person I've ever met online has ghosted me. Most the time it's within the first few messages or day. But I've had a number of great friendships evolve from meeting online. Actually had lunch with a girl I met off Reddit when I was in new York for work for a week. She had a boyfriend but we had established early in that I respect that and want to be friends. (Because we both did some light flirting with each other. We agreed to keep it to flirting and nothing more.) We had. A complete blast. We were both nervous  wrecks and we both knew it and played through it. We got each other gift bags. The tension at the end of the night was so strong. I feel like she felt it too. She had told me people always tell her she gives intense eye contact. But that night, even though she was giving me plenty earlier. She had a hard time meeting my eyes. Our hands would flick together when we walked and shed pull away. We had long hug as we said goodbye and if circumstances were different. It would have ended with a kiss. I was devasted after we parted. Cause I felt like she was incredible, but id never get the chance. We kept texting for months after. But feels like she grew out of me. Hasn't texted me back in a month. 

I'm not a sex offender. I haven't murdered anyone. I don't send unwarranted dick pics. I don't lustfully go for women. I'm a care free guy. I'm a listener and a giver. Ive googled my name and all that comes up is my linked in. Outside of the same named individuals that have a higher social status. I mean. One of those names is I guess a known gay porn star. But he looks nothing like me lol. 

I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing I guess. I'm happier with myself and life now than I've ever been. Yeah I've got a big hole in my heart and a hopeless romantic like everyone else. But what else can I do. Whatever.

I work as an outside sales liaison for a medical company, building relationships with accounts.

 I took two weeks off to bury my mom, and on the day I returned to the office, I was fired with the reason that they “couldn’t afford me.” 

Since then, my final paycheck has been withheld.Initially, they demanded a death certificate for my mom and a doctor’s note for a sick day, which I provided. 

Now, they claim via email that they’re auditing credit card receipts and will hold my paycheck until the audit is complete. I don’t recall signing any agreement allowing them to deduct charges from my wages or withhold my check for this reason, and I’ve asked them to send any such agreement, but they haven’t provided it.

The company uses HubSpot, a CRM database for tracking client interactions, but I only logged accounts about half the time. My boss frequently reprimanded me for not logging consistently, as I disliked it. They’re now cross-referencing my credit card charges (for lunches, treats for accounts, and similar expenses) with my HubSpot entries, which will show discrepancies since I didn’t always log. 

However, these charges were business expenses for client relations, (lunches, treats, coffees) not personal, and HubSpot isn’t a financial tracking tool. My boss’s knowledge of my inconsistent logging undermines their claim that unlogged charges are personal.

Four and a half hours ago, I emailed them, stating that Arizona law (A.R.S. § 23-353) prohibits withholding my final paycheck and that any deductions require a signed agreement, which I don’t recall. I’ve received no response. I have all emails for reference.I’m at a loss because I urgently need this paycheck.

Hallo!~


Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You’re introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let’s chat. No rush—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

If you’re looking for a loyal, drama-free connection (and someone to steal hoodies from), DM me. Let’s trade stories and playlists first.

I'm not looking to rush things, I want to make that connection, it's more than just a spark. ",1,1746819189.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False
1kir40k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1kir40k/took_mcat_with_zero_sleep/,Took MCAT with zero sleep,"So I don’t really struggle with sleep anxiety (probably twice so far in my life) but of course it had to happen the night before the big day. If you happen to get into the same situation I did, DO NOT PANIC. Here’s what I found super helpful to staying alert and focused (besides coffee). And maybe this will be helpful even if you were well rested. I ended up getting a 514 which is not too far from my fl.

- It sounds silly but it’s important for you to gaslight yourself into thinking that you got adequate sleep. Literally say it out loud to convince yourself. 

- take a quick cold shower while continuing to convince yourself that you just got the best sleep of your life.

- if you’re like me and you can’t stand people walking behind you during an exam, ask to be placed in the corner before you begin. I don’t know if all centers will take requests but it doesn’t hurt to ask. 

- Get yourself one of those small Mario Badescu face sprays (or even just a water spray) and spray your face every break period. You can also use the bathroom sink but I like the surprise attack of the face spray. On top of that I also used some hydrating cream under my eyes every break period. 

- I CANNOT stress enough how helpful this was: artificial tears/lubricating eye drops (any brand OTC - preferably preservative free). They should let you bring it into the testing room. Will come in handy when your eyes get tired/dry. Use it before every section

Remember to stay hydrated and calm. 😌 You will get through it, I promise! Good luck to everyone who will be taking it soon. Wishing you all the best, future MD or DO!",7,1746819061.0,Mcat,0,1.0,False

1kir37l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1kir37l/10_lessons_from_launching_10_ttrpg_kickstarter/,10 Lessons from Launching 10 TTRPG Kickstarter Campaigns,"Hey folks! I hope everyone’s rolling high this week — I wanted to share something that might help fellow creators in this amazing community: I launched my first TTRPG project at 22, and after 8 years and 10 campaigns, I’ve gathered 10 hard-earned lessons that shaped my journey as an indie creator. I hope this helps.



Let’s start with this — I was 22 years old when we launched our first project. I had just graduated from university, full of passion as a TTRPG player, and I had gathered my friends around this wild dream. That’s how *Svilland* was born, more or less.

Over the past 8 years, that 22-year-old has learned *a lot*. And now I want to share the **10 most important lessons** that have stuck with me through it all.

# Lesson 1: Know Your Why, Defining Your Campaign’s Heart

This might sound obvious, but trust me — many creators launch projects without ever defining the heart of their campaign. And yes, *I’ve done it too.*

We had a solid Unique Selling Point (USP), but over time it started to feel weak to me. The rest of the team didn’t quite feel the same way, but I managed to convince them otherwise (honestly… I wish I hadn’t).

The result? We ended up changing the project *twice*. The core message became diluted, the direction got muddy, and the project lost its soul. It didn’t meet expectations, it overburdened the team, and it cost more than planned.

So, to team mates: I’m still sorry. Mistakes were made — and lessons were learned 😅

# Lesson 2: Listen Before Launch

When we’re focused on a goal, we can sometimes lose sight of what’s around us. That hyperfocus blinds us to problems.

In those moments, I ask for feedback from trusted friends **who aren’t working on the project**. Their outside perspective has saved me from major mistakes.

If you don’t have someone like that, message me — seriously, I’d be happy to help.

# Lesson 3: Graphic Design!

Of course, I had to include this — I’m also a graphic designer!

In crowdfunding, your product needs to look as good as it is. Beautiful design *sells*. If your team lacks the capability to create top-tier visuals for your Kickstarter page, consider hiring someone who can.

This doesn’t mean your design needs to be complex — it needs to be *clear, attractive, and polished*.

# Lesson 4: Budget Like Your Campaign Depends on It

You already know budgeting is critical. But it’s even more important in today’s chaotic global political economy.

China is no longer a viable option for many publishers. We all need backup plans — ideally **three versions** of your budget:

* **Option A**: Everything goes well
* **Option B**: Things get bumpy
* **Option C**: Holy $%!#, what now?

We lived through Option B — it cost us around **$25,000 extra**, mostly due to freight issues during the pandemic. (Story for another day.)

# Lesson 5: The backers, our wonderful backers

Let’s be real — if it weren’t for passionate people backing our campaigns, this indie ecosystem wouldn’t exist.

In my 8 years, I’ve realized something: **TTRPG backers are some of the smartest consumers out there.** They know what they’re looking for, and they know when to support a project — and when not to.

Make friends with your engaged backers — the ones in your Discord, leaving comments, asking questions. I don’t know who *aPestilence* or *Ekonometras* really are, but I know they helped keep our company alive.

# Lesson 6: Playtest with your backers

Some publishers are hesitant to share test content with backers. Sure, someone might leak it on Telegram, and you might lose a little revenue.

But remember: your backers are here because they want to be **part of the process**. Let them in. Share your early drafts, let them playtest, and involve them in development.

# Lesson 7: Use Stretch Goals Wisely (Don’t Overpromise)

We’ve been there… 😂

One of our campaigns performed way above expectations, and we started adding more stretch goals. One of them was *cut-scene animations* at the end of each chapter in an adventure. GMs would play them to tee up the next chapter.

It was a cool idea. We had a budget. We were ready — until the artist quit. And we couldn’t replace him for months. We had to inform backers and change the stretch goal.

So, here’s the takeaway: **Cool ideas are awesome**, but make sure they won’t drain you or your team — emotionally or financially.

# Lesson 8: Prepare for the Post-Campaign Grind

This one is hard for me. After a campaign ends, the team naturally relaxes — and that’s not a bad thing.

In fact, I now plan for it. I give the team one week off. During that time, I reset the roadmap, clean up workflows, and mentally prepare everyone for the next phase. It helps a lot.

# Lesson 9: Learn from Failure (It’s Inevitable)

Out of the 10 campaigns I’ve run, **one was a failure** — our second project, actually. We canceled it after the first week. It hit us hard, emotionally and mentally.

Here’s what I learned:

* Don’t launch a project you don’t fully understand
* Don’t rely on Kickstarter— rely on your *project’s value*
* Don’t skip iteration. We didn’t test or iterate enough, and it showed. A similar project came out months later and succeeded — simply because it was better iterated.

# Lesson 10: Celebrate!

Crowdfunding is unpredictable. Unless you’re spending tens (or hundreds!) of thousands on pre-launch, you’re partly flying blind.

So if you fund — even at the minimum — and get to make your project a reality… **celebrate with your team**. Take them out for a meal. Let the project pay for it. There’s *nothing* better than enjoying a shared success with the people who made it happen.

# Conclusion

Every campaign teaches you something new — about your audience, your team, the market, and honestly, yourself. These lessons weren’t learned from a textbook or a course — they came from late nights, broken builds, unexpected wins, and yes, some hard failures too.

If you’re just starting out, I hope this gives you a clearer path. If you’ve already been through a few campaigns yourself, maybe you saw some of your own mistakes in here — or avoided ones I didn’t. Either way, we’re all learning, iterating, and telling stories together.

Thanks for reading all the way through! If you’ve got questions, want to share your own experiences, or need someone to take a look at your campaign plan — don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ll find me somewhere between Trello boards, layout spreads, and a pot of coffee that’s probably gone cold again.️

1kir1w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1kir1w2/i_feel_horrible_about_myself/,I feel horrible about myself,"Over the past three years, due to a mix of grad school stress, my husband moving in with me (he cooks such delicious food), untreated ADHD, grief, really bad panic disorder, and my first time getting COVID, I’ve put on 30 lbs. Now I am 5’5”, F, 155-160 lbs depending on the day, overweight, almost none of my clothes fit, and I barely recognize myself. I have been trying to lose weight this whole time, and have only relentlessly gained weight. 

I am very active, barring recovering from Covid and a couple months of fresh grief. I run several days a week. I used to run most days between 6-8 miles, but right now I’m running between 2-5 per run, I’ve only just started feeling my old strength and endurance after COVID. I walk or bike to campus 2 miles both ways several days a week, I try to weight lift 2-4 times a week, I took contemporary dance, tap dance, and figure skating classes this year, so some days I was working out/exercising twice a day, and my husband and I walk our dog between 2-3 miles most nights. 

It’s some muscle gain, but definitely not all muscle gain, because I’ve definitely put on a lot of fat. I haven’t been good at counting calories since like 2020-2021 when I did successfully lose about 16 pounds prior to my wedding, so I’m sure that’s a big part of it. I’ve had eating disorders in the past so I try not to rely on calorie counting but clearly that’s the only thing that works. But even lately, I’ve been counting my calories more (I’m about to literally start weighing everything but worried about that triggering an ED again) and I lost a pound, and then gained 4 in a couple days that won’t budge! I eat MAX 2500 calories on a bad day, I am eating on average probably 2000 and clearly need to get that down because it’s not working.

I’ve been fighting food as a comfort (bad habit picked up during that time of grief when I kept losing people in my life unexpectedly, and also when my panic disorder got really bad in 2022, nausea became a huge trigger for panic attacks, and hunger kind of feels like nausea to my brain, so…. 🙃). And also the dopamine hit that food gives my ADHD brain. I’m working of finding the right meds, I can tell the one that barely did anything at least toned my hunger down a little bit, but not much else. The other med I had a horrible reaction to. I’m trying a new one in a couple of weeks once I get back from Japan. I also get really hungry throughout the day despite eating balanced meals or eating more protein.

This is what a typical day of eating looks like:
5 am - wake up, a serving of oats with 1 tbsp peanut butter (yes I measure), 1 cup of raspberries. 2 cups of coffee with a serving of half and half each (yes I measure).
7 am - go for a run (I usually go earlier but this semester I was having trouble getting out the door at my old time of 6-6:30)
8 am - RAVENOUS so I eat a 200 calorie barebell protein bar to get me through the rest of the morning
Dance class some days in the morning or lab where I am constantly walking and standing
10:30 am (some days, due to classes) or 1 pm (other days due to classes) - a bagel with avocado, salt, and pepper, or last night’s leftovers if I’m able to get home. We make relatively healthy dinners so…. And then I have a cup of decaf coffee with a serving of half and half, measured again
Weights or ice skating depending on the day, just weights now as the ice skating season is over
3 or 4 pm - usually ravenous again and need a snack 
5:30-6:30 - dinner, usually homemade but sometimes (1-2x a week max) takeout, sometimes dessert
7- dog walk
I don’t eat anything later than 7, I don’t get hungry in the evening after dinner or at night

I think the culprits are the protein bars (but I get nauseous and starving if I don’t eat one), homemade meals (we’re careful to balance meals and not add too much butter, oil, or salt but we could be adding more veggies and it just tastes so good I have a problem with overeating dinner), and leftovers, but I’m having trouble putting things into action and finding a way to get balanced but not deprive myself but not gain more weight! I talked to a nutritionist who said to eat a bigger breakfast in the morning and add more fruits and veggies to meals and snacks instead of taking anything away but I ended up putting on an extra 10 lbs when I did that!

Help! I’m so frustrated and this is the heaviest I’ve ever been, and the techniques I’ve used to lose weight in the past are not working for me!",1,1746818912.0,loseit,4,0.66,False

They shook audiences in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including one infamous appearance on *The Late Late Show*. “They are unique and different,” said a clearly nervous Gay Byrne by way of introduction. He wasn’t wrong. Friday often wore dresses and make-up before such things were popular or profitable.

Despite the Virgin Prunes’ cult success, Friday left the band in 1986, turning first to painting before recording three albums with the multi-instrumentalist Maurice Seezer. One of these, *Shag Tobacco*, came perilously close to housing a genuine hit when the gorgeous *Angel* was included on the soundtrack to the Baz Luhrmann-directed film *Romeo and Juliet*.

Born Fionán Hanvey in 1959, Friday’s dance card has also included a spot of acting, popping up beside Cillian Murphy in both *Disco Pigs* and Neil Jordan’s *Breakfast on Pluto*, and he and Seezer have composed several high-profile film scores including their Ivor Novello-nominated work on Jim Sheridan’s *In America*.

He released a solo record, *Catholic*, back in 2011, which stood alone until last October’s follow-up, *Ecce Homo*. Friday also hadn’t played a headlining gig in over a decade, but remedied that with some recent European dates and two Irish shows, including a night at Dublin’s Vicar Street venue last month. The gig reviews glowed.

Today we are talking over coffee and cigarettes in Friday’s beautiful Rathmines townhouse, where he moved a few years back after an extended sojourn in Killiney. At his feet sits his constant companion, the 15-year-old dachshund Stan (the Man).

1kir10h,https://www.reddit.com/r/kickstarter/comments/1kir10h/10_lessons_from_launching_10_ttrpg_kickstarter/,10 Lessons from Launching 10 TTRPG Kickstarter Campaigns,"Hey folks!  I hope everyone’s rolling high this week — I wanted to share something that might help fellow creators in this amazing community: I launched my first TTRPG project at 22, and after 8 years and 10 campaigns, I’ve gathered 10 hard-earned lessons that shaped my journey as an indie creator. I hope this helps.

Let’s start with this — I was 22 years old when we launched our first project. I had just graduated from university, full of passion as a TTRPG player, and I had gathered my friends around this wild dream. That’s how *Svilland* was born, more or less.

Over the past 8 years, that 22-year-old has learned *a lot*. And now I want to share the **10 most important lessons** that have stuck with me through it all.

# Lesson 1: Know Your Why, Defining Your Campaign’s Heart

This might sound obvious, but trust me — many creators launch projects without ever defining the heart of their campaign. And yes, *I’ve done it too.*

We had a solid Unique Selling Point (USP), but over time it started to feel weak to me. The rest of the team didn’t quite feel the same way, but I managed to convince them otherwise (honestly… I wish I hadn’t).

The result? We ended up changing the project *twice*. The core message became diluted, the direction got muddy, and the project lost its soul. It didn’t meet expectations, it overburdened the team, and it cost more than planned.

So, to team mates: I’m still sorry. Mistakes were made — and lessons were learned 😅

# Lesson 2: Listen Before Launch

When we’re focused on a goal, we can sometimes lose sight of what’s around us. That hyperfocus blinds us to problems.

In those moments, I ask for feedback from trusted friends **who aren’t working on the project**. Their outside perspective has saved me from major mistakes.

Hallo!~


Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You’re introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let’s chat. No rush—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

If you’re looking for a loyal, drama-free connection (and someone to steal hoodies from), DM me. Let’s trade stories and playlists first.

I'm not looking to rush things, I want to make that connection, it's more than just a spark. ",1,1746818832.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Figured since this community is great at helping others plan their trip I'd share what I did and my thoughts to help the next group of travelers. 

I'm staying in Waikoloa village which is not ideal unless you plan on chilling at the resort the whole time. If I came back I'd try to stay more in Kona to be a little more central.

Did the manta ray night tour with Seaquest and it was great. The girls who were our group leaders were great, one was giving us a lot of fun information and facts about the rays. We saw a lot and it was truly a ton of fun and super cool. They literally came up to us and were inches away. A must do!

We went to Volcanoes national Park and that was a really great day. Plenty to see and lots of not too hard hikes. We got a mini tour with a volunteer ranger which was awesome to hear the history of the park and see pictures of how it's changed over time. We saw the volcano as it was doing mini eruptions and unfortunately we left about an hour before the massive eruption. Definitely bummed we missed the 500ft eruption but it was still awesome to see the volcano going off.

We took the long route to drive here and it was definitely a long drive so be prepared for a long drive unless you're staying in Hilo. We had dinner at the Pineapple cafe place and it was really good. We didnt see too much of the town but it definitely was a bit run down and lots of homeless, but I'm sure it has it's bright spots.

The last big activity was Mauna Kea with the Mauna Kea summit adventures. Yes it's very pricey, $300/person. But you get a ton of value from it including transportation and a guide who can tell you things about the mountain and Hawaii in general. Our guide was AMAZING! Huge shout out to Travis, he was so knowledgeable and an amazing guide. They also have a nice telescope so you can see the stars up close, something you probably wouldn't do if you DIYd it.

For food, some hit and misses. Some people here said orchid Thai is great but I felt really let down. Food was average at best. Broke da mouth grindZ was spectacular. We did a nice dinner at Don's mai tai bar, the fish tacos were amazing and you can't beat the view.

We rented snorkels and tried to go in the waikola area but it was super choppy and all the good areas were on private resort beaches or were behind gates communities. 

The sushi at the grocery store at Queens market in Waikoloa was actually really good too. 

Overall the big Island is great, definitely more of an activities and adventure Island but I'm sure there are some more chill beaches to relax if that's more your vibe.

If I come back I'd check out a coffee tour even though I'm not a coffee drinker and try to do more Beaches or snorkeling south of Kona.

Enamel percolators, which are typically made of metal coated with a porcelain enamel, are popular for their durability and aesthetic appeal. However, they can become stained or burnt if coffee is left to sit too long or if the pot is exposed to high heat without sufficient liquid. To clean a burnt enamel percolator, you'll want to use gentle yet effective methods to avoid damaging the enamel surface.

The first step is to allow the percolator to cool completely. Trying to clean it while it’s still hot may result in burns or further damage to the enamel. Once it's cool, empty any remaining liquid or burnt coffee grounds. Then, rinse the inside with warm water to loosen any loose debris.

Next, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water, which is one of the most effective and safe ways to clean burnt enamel. Make a thick paste by mixing baking soda with a small amount of water, and apply it generously to the burnt areas. Let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes. This gives the baking soda time to break down the burnt residue. After it has sat, use a soft sponge or a non-abrasive scrub brush to gently scrub the inside of the percolator. Avoid using steel wool or any harsh scrubbing pads, as they can scratch and damage the enamel coating.

If the baking soda method isn’t enough to fully clean the burnt area, another option is to use white vinegar. Fill the percolator with a solution made of equal parts water and white vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil, either on the stovetop or by plugging in the percolator if it's electric. Once it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and let the solution sit in the percolator for about an hour. This helps to loosen any remaining burnt material. After soaking, pour out the vinegar solution and rinse the pot thoroughly with clean water.

For particularly stubborn stains or burnt areas, a combination of baking soda and vinegar can be used. Sprinkle baking soda directly onto the burnt area, then pour vinegar over it to create a fizzy reaction. Let the reaction bubble for a few minutes, then scrub gently with a soft sponge.

After the burnt material has been removed, wash the percolator with warm soapy water, rinse well, and dry it thoroughly. This helps remove any lingering vinegar or baking soda residue and restores the pot to a clean state.

Finally, to prevent future burning, avoid leaving the percolator unattended on heat for long periods, and always ensure there is enough water inside when brewing. Regular cleaning after each use also helps maintain the enamel finish and keeps the percolator in good condition.

With a little patience and care, your enamel percolator can be cleaned effectively and returned to regular use without damage.",1,1746818703.0,KitchenHack,0,1.0,False

I was thinking about why straight ships aren’t really popular in Genshin, and honestly i think it’s because HoYoverse just doesn’t tease them the way they do with their wlw and mlm ships. Most of the time, people love to say, “Why does this fandom make every character gay?”—well, it’s because that’s what we’re used to seeing. Just name any popular character and you’ll see they get ship teased with someone of the same sex. And before someone comes and say “Well Furina doesn’t have any same-sex ship tease,” just go listen to Miss Coffee’s voicelines. HoYo knows what they’re doing. Even Dahlia, seems to be in love with Venti.


Meanwhile, the characters that do have potential for straight ship teasing either stop appearing together or are just forgotten. Look at Jean and Diluc. They haven’t had a real conversation since the Mondstadt archon quest which was five years ago. Clorinde is always paired with Navia, Wriothesley sticks with Neuvillette, Ayato barely shows up, and Yae is always teased with Ei. Itto and Sara don't even have any on screen conversation yet. And yeah, Mavuika and Capitano had a little teasing early on, but in the end, Capitano dies and into “they respected each other as warriors.” Like there was potential for something but nothing happened. Aether/Lumine ships mostly exist for self-inserters so i am not going to count them. 


And even when straight teasing does happen, their ""teasing"" comes nowhere near as the queer ships I don't know if you guys know this there’s literally a light novel in-game where Ei and Miko kiss it’s canon, but it was an event-exclusive book so it's not available anymore, but you can still look it up. It’s called ""Pretty Please, Kitsune"". Kaveh and Alhaitham have matching idle animations, similar constellations, and everybody knows what's going on with them about them. Looking at other HoYoverse games, Evelyn and Astra (ZZZ) got an exclusive MV, and Black Swan and Acheron (HSR) had a dance video—and if you look at their designs, even their color schemes match. Acheron has darker purple hair and light purple clothes, and Black Swan is in the reverse lighter purple hair darker purple clothes.


Also to be honest straight ships just come off as bland and boring. Sorry, it’s just my opinion, but they don’t have the same spice or angst their queer counterparts do. And before anyone misunderstands— Now before i end this i want to add i am not against queer ships. I do both queer and straight ships and i love Kaveh x Alhaitham just like every other fujoshi girl out there, Ningguang and Beidou too are into each other and i can't seem them with someone else I just wish HoYoverse put that same level of effort into teasing straight ships too.

I'm a 38-year-old guy from Worcester, UK, hoping to find a genuine e-friend for some regular (or semi-regular) chats and to share some nerdy enthusiasm with!

So, a bit about me:
 * Gaming & Tech: I'm a heavy Xbox gamer, so if you are too, I'd love to hear what you're playing! Beyond that, I have a massive enthusiasm for AI – I really enjoy experimenting with image generation using Midjourney and using tools like Gemini for various projects and day-to-day tasks. I also have a soft spot for all things Mecha – think Battletech, Gundam, and Transformers. If you're into giant robots, we'll likely have plenty to discuss!

 * Hobbies & Interests: I'm a self-confessed coffee snob and love nothing more than finding a chilled spot to enjoy a quality brew. I'm also a huge board game enthusiast and have a collection of nearly 50 games at home! I keep trying to get back into reading, but I have aphantasia (meaning I don't visualise images in my mind), which can make it a bit of a unique challenge – always interesting to discuss if you're curious!

 * Personality: I'm definitely an introvert, so I thrive in calm environments and appreciate kind, honest people. A quirky sense of humour is a massive plus! I tend to get anxious in loud, busy situations or with highly energised folks, so a more laid-back connection would be ideal.

What I'm looking for:
I'm primarily looking for an e-friend to connect with – someone who ideally shares some of these passions and enjoys nerding out over similar topics. I'm looking for someone I can build a comfortable and genuine friendship with. While the main goal is an online connection, if you happen to be relatively local (or even if not, and we really click down the line), the idea of grabbing a coffee or even playing a board game at a cafe sometime would be pretty cool.

How I like to chat:
Email is my preferred way to start and build things up. 

If any of this resonates with you and you're also looking for a friendly, nerdy connection, I'd love to hear from you. Send me a message and tell me a bit about yourself – what games are you into, what's your favourite coffee spot, or what's the latest AI creation you've been impressed by?

Looking forward to hopefully connecting!

Cheers,

So far, I have tried long and short-acting Ritalin and Concerta. The most effective one so far was the long-acting Ritalin. The positive effect is that it makes me feel lighter as if the heavy cloud has been lifted off of me. Otherwise, I stay in bed for almost half a day and can't get anything done, but on medication, I find it easier to get up and complete small tasks.   
  
But I still experience the side effects listed below:

\- Blurry vision

\- Increased heart rate (sometimes it's actually higher than usual, and other times it just feels that way)

\- Shortness of breath

\- Muscle tension (the same kind of tension you feel when you are anxious, but I am not anxious about anything particular)

\- Sweaty hands 

  
I wonder if others have similar side effects. I think I am susceptible to jitteriness because I feel similarly when I drink too much coffee. These side effects make me doubt my diagnosis and make me feel hopeless.

 I am on a school break this week, and I want to do so many exciting things. But days pass and I find myself in bed for hours. It makes me feel like I am wasting my life. ",1,1746818248.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1kiqru3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kiqru3/will_the_wacaco_nanopresso_portable_espresso/,Will the WACACO Nanopresso portable espresso maker redefine your coffee experience review?,"Testing out the WACACO Nanopress+Bag+Adapter was quite the adventure. As someone who practically survives on espresso, this portable espresso machine promised a lot, and I was eager to see if it could deliver. This compact tool, designed for both ground coffee and NS capsules, has been my go-to gadget for quick, flavorful espresso, whether I was camping, traveling, or running errands.

**Portability That Truly Impresses**

Carrying this espresso maker around is nothing short of convenient. At just 1.54 pounds and small enough to slip into my backpack, it’s earned a permanent spot on my adventures. Its manual operation might have initially seemed like a hassle, but it only took a few uses for me to get comfortable with the bike-pump-style mechanism. Every squeeze of the compact pump builds pressure that hits an impressive 18 bars, coaxing out a wonderfully creamy and aromatic espresso. Honestly, it's like carrying an entire café in my bag, minus the excessive weight.

**Craftsmanship and Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about this product was its solid construction. The robust plastic material ensures durability without making it feel flimsy. I tested the espresso machine in various environments—from cozy kitchen counters to rugged camping trips—and it withstood it all without a scratch. The built-in espresso cup and the filter basket integrate functionality with practicality, and the thoughtful inclusion of tools like a scoop and a cleaning brush keeps the setup organized.

**Advantages**

- Compact and travel-friendly, ideal for camping or road trips.  
- NS capsule compatibility gives flexibility for pod-lovers.  
- Sturdy construction ensures durability in diverse conditions.  
- Easy-to-clean components make maintenance a breeze.  

[Check WACACO Nanopress+Bag+Adapter price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07bdffpjf/)

**Challenges With Manual Operation**

Getting into the groove of using it required a bit of trial and error. Pushing the pump horizontally instead of vertically felt a bit awkward at first, and a certain level of hand strength is necessary—something my partner pointed out as not being her favorite part of the process. One time, I didn’t secure the lid properly, and I ended up with a bit of hot water trickling out, which wasn’t exactly a pleasant surprise. These hiccups were minor, but for a first-time user, they could lead to some frustration.

**Limitations**

- Requires significant hand strength to operate comfortably.  
- Improper lid tightening can cause leakage during use.  
- Only makes single servings unless additional accessories, like the barista kit, are purchased.  

**Ease of Use for Busy Days**

Running late has never stopped me from grabbing my espresso since getting this. It’s become a morning lifesaver during busy workdays or road trips. Using ground coffee requires precision in tamping and grain size, as getting that perfect crème layer can be a bit hit or miss. The NS capsules, on the other hand, saved me from this extra prep. I could simply pop one into the adapter, and within minutes, I had a shot that rivaled most café-served espresso.

**Comparing to Peer Products**

Similar manual espresso machines don’t quite measure up when it comes to the pressure output and compatibility with both capsules and ground coffee. For instance, while other brands offer compact machines, they often compromise on pressure, resulting in a thinner crema and less robust flavor. On the flip side, electric models fare better in consistency but lack portability. That’s where this product excels—it combines high-quality espresso extraction in a highly portable form that’s perfect for coffee addicts like me who are always on the go.

**Smart Spending**

Reflecting on the price, I’d say it fits right into the category of financial value. It’s an investment that pays off with its versatility, durable design, and quality espresso. In comparison to electric espresso machines that are less forgiving on the wallet, this manual machine offers an appreciable balance of cost-efficiency and performance. Personally, I’ve saved on countless coffee shop runs, and it doesn’t feel like I’ve sacrificed taste in the name of convenience.

I have a lot but there are two stories I like the most 😁

My everyday scent for the office and casual occasion is Molecule 01 and even if I own a lot of other niche and more complexe fragrance, it's M01 that get me the most compliments and cause à lot of conversation with strangers.

1st story:

I blind bought M01 because I saw everywhere that it's a layering beast AND its an incredible scent on his own. I tried it alone for almost a week and nothing, I could smell nothing neither did my girlfriend. My two best friends also couldn't smell it...

I genuily tought it was a scam. And I didn't mention it but I am a male and was 29 at that time.

Then, the friday of that first week of wear, I was going to my hairdressser after work (keep in mind it was 5pm and I applied M01 at 6:30 am).

When I entered the shop, all the 5 haidressers stopped their activities for a moment and where looking at me (I don't look bad but not THAT good lol).
One of them came to me and told me to sit, wait my turn and offered me an espresso.
I saw an other one of them (the one who is used to style my hair) snooping next to all her collegues whispering something while looking at me smiling and giggling.

I was scrolling my phone thinking it was a bit rude...

Then, she came, washed my hair, did her job etc.
At the end she leans toward me in a very sensual way, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. 

She told me: "" I am sorry but I must ask, what parfum are you wearing, it's DIVINE""

I told her, then she yelled in the hair salon: ""Girls ! It's eXcentric molecule !"" (Imagine the french accent lol)

One of her collegue respond in a teasing way: ""You took a lot of time to ask we all wanted to know !""  

Since this day, I dig this fragrance and trained to smell it.




2nd story:

A couple years ago, I was at work in the coffee area with maybe 5 collegues. A female coworkers came in and instanly told : ""wah it's smell so good in there, did you guys just make a laundry or something?""
(Honnestly I knew it's was me but I told nothing.)

A bit later that day I had a meeting with her. She came 10min late and we were about 10 people in that meeting room. She was in my diagonal and I saw her sniffing during almost all the time of the meeting, she seems having a good time. One of the guy even ask her if everything was OK 🤣.

Fast forward, the week after, same hour, same meeting. This time she was early and when I came in the room she was alone typing on her computer. A couple seconds later, without saying Hi, she stopped everything she was doing, she lift her heads up and was looking at me like she had an epiphany.
She told me: ""It was you ! ...""

We talk a lot about parfum, we are now good friends !


Hope you enjoy 😁 Cannot wait to read yours !

## Key features Analysis

The ⁤plastic cup market offers a wide range of ‌options, each with distinct characteristics. Let's delve into the critical features that differentiate the leading⁢ brands.

**Material Composition:** The type of plastic used substantially impacts‌ the cup's durability, clarity, and recyclability.

Brands are increasingly experimenting with⁢ materials beyond customary polystyrene or⁢ polypropylene. Recycled PET (rPET) is ​gaining traction for its recycled content and clarity. Furthermore, companies‌ are exploring​ bio-based plastics derived from corn ⁤or sugarcane, contributing‌ to a‍ reduced environmental footprint. The material composition directly affects the cup's strength, temperature tolerance, and its suitability ‌for ⁢specific beverages, also its end-of-life ⁢options.**Cup Capacity and Sizes:** The ⁤range of available sizes dictates the cup's versatility for different beverages and serving purposes.

Leading brands typically offer a spectrum of sizes, from small 5-ounce cups for juice or samples to larger 20-ounce cups for sodas or iced drinks. ⁣The variety ‍allows consumers to choose the perfect size for their needs, minimizing waste and ensuring portion control. The internal gradient markers are​ an critically important ⁢factor in⁤ drink portioning in‍ a service or business environment.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The ‍cup's shape,clarity,and‍ printability influence its visual appeal⁤ and branding potential.Clear cups are often favored for showcasing colorful beverages, while opaque cups are preferred for concealing contents or adding⁣ a touch of elegance. Cup design also plays a⁢ crucial role in advertising or promoting a business through printing logos or custom graphics on the available area of the cup. Ergonomic designs with easy-grip textures are also gaining popularity for enhanced user⁣ comfort.

**Durability and Strength:** The cup's ability ⁢resistance to cracking, ‌leaking, and deformation dictates its ‍reliability and suitability for various uses.

High-quality‌ plastic cups should withstand reasonable handling without compromising their structural integrity. Features such as reinforced‌ rims, thicker walls, and impact-resistant materials contribute to enhanced durability.⁢ Also, whether or not cups can survive a drop test has proven to be a crucial piece of data when purchasing a brand as well.

**Stackability ⁢and Storage:** Efficient stacking prevents damage and optimizes storage space.

Well-designed plastic cups should stack neatly without getting​ stuck together‌ or easily toppling over.​ Some ​brands incorporate features like ridges or interlocking elements to enhance stackability, saving valuable storage space in⁢ kitchens and pantries.⁤ A tight‌ but easily separable grip is key to maintaining quality and minimizing damage of the product.

**Sustainability and Recyclability:** The cup's environmental impact and end-of-life options​ are increasingly important considerations for ⁤eco-conscious consumers.

Brands are focusing on using recyclable materials, reducing⁤ plastic ​content, and developing compostable⁣ options.Clear ⁤labeling indicating the cup's recyclability and proper disposal methods ‌is also crucial.Furthermore, participation ⁤in recycling programs and partnerships with ‌waste management companies demonstrate a commitment to environmental responsibility.

Key features of the top plastic cups for 2025 include:

* Recycled and Bio-Based materials
* Wide range of Sizes
* Customizable Designs
*⁣ Enhanced Durability
* Improved Stackability
* Clear Recyclability Labeling

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right plastic cup offers several practical benefits for consumers and businesses.

**Enhanced Convenience:** plastic cups⁣ provide a disposable and lightweight solution for‍ serving beverages, eliminating the need ​for washing and reducing cleanup time, improving efficiency and freeing ‌up valuable time for other‌ tasks/activities. They‍ are especially beneficial ‌for parties, picnics, and events where convenience is a priority.

**Cost Efficiency:** Plastic cups can be more ⁢cost-effective​ than​ reusable alternatives,depending on the frequency of use and quantity required. Bulk purchasing options and readily available supplies make them an attractive‍ choice for businesses and large gatherings. Single use plastic cups reduce the ​costs associated with renting or buying metal or heavy‍ plastic cups.

**Versatile Usage:** Plastic cups are suitable ⁣for a wide range of beverages, from cold drinks to hot beverages⁣ like ‌coffee or tea. Different sizes and thicknesses cater to specific drink types, ensuring an ​optimal drinking experience. Also, ⁢the options ​to decorate those cups further highlight a practical use for versatile customization.

**Improved hygiene:** Single-use plastic cups minimize the risk ‍of contamination and cross-contamination‍ associated with reusable cups. This is notably important in healthcare settings,food service establishments,and ⁣public events where hygiene ‌is paramount. The avoidance of cross-contamination helps reduce the spread of diseases in ⁣these high risk environments.

**Reduced Breakage:** Unlike glass or ceramic cups, plastic cups are less prone to breakage, reducing the risk‍ of​ injuries and spills, creating a safer⁣ more friendly friendly environment, especially for children⁣ and outdoor activities. Their durability makes them a practical choice for⁣ environments where ‍accidents are more likely to occur.

##⁤ FAQs⁤ Section

Here‌ are some frequently asked questions about plastic cups:

**Are all plastic cups‌ recyclable?**
Not all plastic cups are created​ equal in terms of recyclability. While some are made from recyclable materials like PET or‌ polypropylene,others may be made from polystyrene,which is less‍ commonly accepted by recycling facilities. Always check the recycling symbol and local guidelines to determine if a particular cup is recyclable‍ in your area.

**Can plastic cups be ⁣used for hot beverages?**
Some⁣ plastic cups are specifically designed to​ withstand hot temperatures, while others may warp or melt⁣ when exposed to heat. Look for cups labeled ‌as ""heat-resistant"" or‌ ""suitable for hot beverages"" to ensure they can safely hold hot drinks like coffee or tea.

**What are the environmental concerns associated with plastic cups?**
The primary environmental⁤ concerns associated with plastic cups stem from their reliance on fossil⁢ fuels for production, their persistence in the environment, and their potential to contribute to plastic pollution. Choosing cups made from recycled or bio-based materials, and properly disposing of them⁣ in ⁣recycling​ bins, can help mitigate⁢ these concerns.

**Are there alternatives to traditional plastic cups?**
Yes, several alternatives‍ to traditional plastic cups exist, including reusable cups made from materials like stainless steel, glass, ​or durable plastic, as well as compostable cups made from plant-based materials like paper or cornstarch. These alternatives offer a more sustainable option for⁣ reducing plastic waste, but come with their own advantages and ⁣disadvantages such ‍as cost, durability, and convenience.

1kiqpmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1kiqpmu/why_does_my_boyfriend_struggle_to_let_go_of_his_ex/,Why does my boyfriend struggle to let go of his ex?,"Hi everyone. I’m looking for some perspective on a situation that’s been weighing on me. My boyfriend and I (both mid-30s) have been together for about 5–6 months. We’re deeply in love and genuinely happy together. The only recurring conflict we have centers around his former fiancée, and I’d appreciate any insights from those who have been through something similar—on either side.

For context:  
He was in a 7-year relationship that ended about 3 months before we met. They were engaged, lived together, and eventually opened the relationship because she wanted to explore polyamory. During that time, she dated others, while he did not. She ultimately left him for one of her other partners.

They never went truly no-contact post-breakup—the longest was one week. For months after the breakup, she still had keys to his place, kept belongings at his apartment, and they frequently invited each other to hang out, run errands, or get coffee/brunch—despite her new partner not liking their continued closeness, and he single and dating.

When we started dating, I gradually learned how emotionally enmeshed they still were. After many tough but honest conversations about boundaries, he eventually did a clean break and returned her things. It actually took *two* rounds to fully clear out her stuff. He finally went no-contact about a month into our relationship—at my request. However, he has recently expressed that he wants to resume contact with her again, stating that he doesn’t believe in “cutting people out” and that she’s an important person in his life. We’ve fought about this more than once.

He is in therapy and acknowledges he has issues with letting go. But he sees this as a virtue: that no one should have to permanently lose someone they love or were close to. I’ve told him clearly that this continued emotional attachment to his ex will likely cost him our relationship, because it’s painful for me and feels incompatible with the boundaries I need to feel safe.

I’d love to hear your thoughts—especially from other men who were/are in longterm relationships:

* Why might someone have such a hard time letting go of an ex who 1) pushed him into a relationship dynamic he didn’t want, 2) ultimately left him, and 3) continued to rely on him in arguably codependent ways?

1kiqpg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1kiqpg6/couldnt_get_on_the_plane_today/,Couldn't get on the plane today.,"I've had a flight scheduled for today and for the whole week leading up to it if I thought about the flight I'd get a little flutter in my chest. I've never really like flying but my stress and anxiety over the last couple years has really made it difficult to keep myself together. 

Flight was supposed to be at 11:30 today. Woke up at my normal time around 6:30, had my coffee and breakfast and finished the little bit of packing I needed to do. And about 1hr before the flight bam.. severe panic attack. 99% of the time my wife flys with me and I genuinely thank that helps but this time she out of town herself. 

I just feel broken, at my wits end. I take Wellbutrin and Prozac on the daily for anxiety and depression. Both these meds are fairly new to me, within the last two months. My psychiatrist also prescribed me Xanax for flying and I took 1mg mg total today. (1) .25 at home earlier. (1) .25 when I got into the Uber on the way to the airport, only a 15 min trip and then I felt like my anxiety was at a 10 still so I took the newer (1) .5mg when I was sitting at the gate. The Xanax I feel like I push right through it.I genuinely couldn't control my feelings, had terrible chest pain, my heart was beating out of my chest. 

My stress over the last 6 months has increased tremendously. I own my own business and it's just been a huge stressor for me.

I was supposed to fly out to visit my mom for mother's Day but couldn't. I called her and she obviously wants the best for me so I decide it's best not to travel like this and just went home. 

I'm obviously feeling a lot of regret and disappointment in myself but once stepping into my house it's like the weigh was lifted off my chest. I'm going to spend the day recovering from this and try again in the near future. Going for long walks seems to be the only real thing that brings be back to reality without taking any medicine. 

I know I'm not alone in this and I've got the support of my family and my wonderful wife but my goodness is this tough. 

Anyways, one day at a time. ",2,1746818029.0,PanicAttack,1,1.0,False

Don’t let the chubby 3 15/16” format fool you; this little powerhouse packs complexity, creaminess, and character into every puff. Blended by Willy Herrera and the team at Drew Estate, the Shade line was designed to offer a Connecticut experience with more body and depth—and in the Flying Pig vitola, it delivers that vision in an expressively bold, beautifully crafted smoke.

I fired one up on a early afternoon after lunch with a diet coke in hand and just enough time to unwind.


Presentation & Cold Draw

True to the Flying Pig line, the Shade version comes in a stubby perfecto shape, with its signature pigtail cap and closed foot. The Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper is buttery smooth to the touch, with a light honey-blonde hue and delicate veins that scream quality.

On the cold draw; once the cap was clipped - I picked up sweet cream, hay, a touch of cedar, and a bit of dried fruit. The draw had a slight resistance but it felt promising.


First Third – Creamy & Zesty

The closed foot gave off a burst of spice and toasted bread on ignition. Once the burn opened up, the profile mellowed into a smooth mix of cream, light coffee, sweet cedar with a soft floral undertone. The retrohale brought a gentle white pepper and lemon zest; just enough to tingle the senses without overwhelming the profile.

Despite its short length, the smoke output was massive and the cigar stayed cool and composed. The burn line curved slightly due to the shape.


Second Third – Rich, Compact Complexity

The second third deepened the experience. Cashew, honey, and a buttery mouthfeel joined the mix, balanced by a touch of cinnamon and some woody tones. The creaminess was always present, but it never felt flat; there was just enough spice and depth to keep the palate intrigued.

The draw opened up slightly as the cigar progressed, becoming more effortless. For a short format, the transitions were surprisingly distinct and satisfying. The burn line corrected itself without effort and the ash hold firmly - superb construction on this one! 

Final Third – A Refined Finish

In the final third, the sweetness gave way to more toasted almond, a bit of leather and a touch of earthiness. The pepper on the retrohale returned rounding out the experience with a delicate kick. Even as the cigar drew to a close, it stayed cool and smooth - no harshness, no bitterness, just a clean finish.

Burn performance was excellent throughout; no touch-ups needed, and the ash held strong for such a small stick, I only needed to ash it once at the very end! 

Final Thoughts

The Undercrown Shade Flying Pig is everything a short format cigar should be: flavorful, well constructed and perfectly balanced. It delivers far more depth than you’d expect from a Connecticut, while keeping that silky smooth profile that makes it so approachable.

With a smoke time of 35–45 minutes, it’s a great short smoke - perfect for coffee breaks, afternoon wind-downs, or when you want richness without committing to a full size stick.

Furthermore, I want to do 3-5 different water recipes (tap water to distilled water ratio differs) and then go from there. Is there any harm is cupping with extremely small amount of coffee in each cup? Maybe 5-6 grams in each water recipes.

""She’s on the phone, walking down the street. She enters a café and hangs up the phone. She sits down at one of the tables.

”You had me worried there. Why are you so late?”

”I’m late?”

“You are.”

“Well, I’m here now, right?”

“Yeah. It certainly has been a while since we’ve last seen each-other, hasn’t it?”

She gets out her phone, checking the date.

“What are you doing?” 

“Really has…”, she mutters to herself. “Nothing, I was just… checking the date.”

“Put that down.”

“Okay.” she said as she instinctively listened.

“So, what can I get for you?”

“Well-”

“One espresso latte, and a black coffee for her.” he said as she leaned back.

The waiter clarified, getting a simple “yes”.

“So how has she been?” he asked.

“Oh, her? She’s… she’s alright.”

“That isn’t an answer.”

“Why are you so obsessed with her anyways?!”

“Do not talk back to me.” he said in an aggressive tone.

“So, are you going to answer my question?”

“She turned 4 recently. Some of her friends came by, but… I was the only adult there.”

“Go on.”

“One of the kids came up to me- asked, ‘Where’s her daddy?’.” she said in a sad tone.

“At least she didn’t hear.”

“That’s not what I’m interested in.”

“I didn’t tell him-”

“And does she know?” She pauses, deliberating before giving her answer.

“No.”

“Good.”

“Is it?”, she asked.

“And… why’d you get me a brown?”

“Didn’t think you’d complain.”

“I’m not-”

“Now, does anybody else know?”

“Of course not.”

“Been seeing anyone else lately?”

“No.” He sipped on his latte.

“That’s right. And you won’t – or…”

“You don’t need to remind me.”

“Good.”

“Hey, John?”

“Hm?”

“Remember when we would go out together, having so much fun? That time we went out to the park was… amazing.” she said, reminiscing.

“What’s your point?”

“Why’d you have to do this?”

He didn’t flinch. “Because I deserve it.”

“Were there others?”

“There were. But they forgot about the consequences.”

“How does it make you feel, knowing how many you’ve hurt?”

He smiled. “Good.”

They continued as they drank their morning coffee, but it eventually came to an end.

She went back home. It was a weekend, so she spent her time with her daughter. They had fun. And then it ended. She was left there thinking as she lay down on her hard mattress.

“What went wrong?”, she thought to herself. And that thought never left her. She never found love again.

He's not keen on going to the local shop to get groceries as he'd have to talk to the cashier, something we can wait on a bit. Nor does he want to demonstrate his independence by doing more chores indepenedently - for some reason being in charge of his own laundry was not appealing.

He's expressed interest in taking over making breakfast for him and his sister in the morning, having already taken on coffee making duties. This is just cereal and milk but it's one possible area.

I don’t normally post long threads, but today I felt I had to.

If you're reading this, chances are anxiety has its grip on you. Maybe it's been months. Maybe years. Maybe you're hiding it from people around you while slowly breaking down inside. That was me.

I spent years googling ""how to stop anxiety"" at 2 AM, trying meditation apps, quitting caffeine, and even whispering affirmations to myself in the mirror like some kind of ritual. And still—tight chest. Racing thoughts. That weird floaty feeling like you’re not even real.

Until 30 days ago.
That was the day I decided to stop surviving and start *strategically healing*.

---

### **Why Most Anxiety ""Fixes"" Don't Work**

We live in a world of quick hacks and instant relief. Pop a pill. Watch a reel. Light a candle. Boom, gone.

Except anxiety doesn’t work like that.

It’s not just a *feeling*. It’s a system—wired into your body, thoughts, and lifestyle. So to truly become anxiety-free, you need a system to *unwire* it.

---

### **The 30-Day Anxiety-Free Plan (Backed by Neuroscience + Real-Life Struggle)**

Here’s exactly what I did. And what I recommend to anyone feeling stuck:

---

#### **Week 1: Awareness & Detox**

* **No caffeine**, no sugar spikes, no doom scrolling. Just 7 days of calm inputs.
* Begin a **thought journal**: Write down 3 triggers per day and how your body reacted.
* Morning routine = hydrate, stretch, affirm (""I am safe in my body"") before looking at your phone.
* Start light breathing practice (4-7-8 method, 3x per day).

**Psych trick**: Don’t say “I have anxiety.” Say “My body is experiencing anxiety.” You are *not* your thoughts.

---

#### **Week 2: Reprogramming**

* Read/listen to 1 podcast or book chapter a day about **neuroplasticity** or **CBT** (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). Knowledge = power over fear.
* Begin **exposure therapy** in microdoses. If crowds stress you, sit near a busy park for 5 minutes.
* Add **guided meditation** before bed, even if it's just 5 minutes of calm.

**Optional tool I used**: [This Ultimate Anxiety Relief Bundle](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-ultimate-anxiety-relief-bundle/6786cf4841f276dbe2af04d1) had a killer CBT workbook + audio tracks that kept me focused when I wanted to give up. Felt like someone *got* what I was going through.

---

#### **Week 3: Mind-Body Connection**

* Move every day. Doesn’t have to be a gym sesh. Walks. Yoga. Dancing in your room counts.
* Cut out energy vampires. One toxic convo can spike your cortisol for hours.
* Start practicing **gratitude stacking**—layer 3 things you're grateful for *with* sensory input (e.g., “Warm coffee in my hands,” “my dog’s sleepy sigh,” “the smell of rain”).

---

#### **Week 4: Reinforcement & Expansion**

* You’ve built a routine. Now double down. Try **cold showers**, **daily affirmations**, or journaling breakthroughs.
* Visualize the *new you*: calm, grounded, in control. Who are they? How do they move, speak, think?
* Join a support group (Reddit counts). Or if you’re a bit private like me, find a low-key digital toolkit. Again, that [anxiety bundle](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-ultimate-anxiety-relief-bundle/6786cf4841f276dbe2af04d1) came in *clutch* for solo work.

---

### **Add-Ons That Made It Easier**

1. **Ashwagandha supplements** – helped with the physical symptoms.
2. **Blue light filters** – sleep is 10x better without late-night screen glare.
3. **Noise-canceling headphones** – when the world is too loud, silence helps regulate.
4. **Therapeutic music apps** – like Brain.fm or any binaural beats playlist.
5. **Printable CBT tools** – like the ones from the anxiety bundle above. Writing things out changed everything.

---

### **What No One Tells You About Healing**

There is no magic switch. But there *is* a rhythm.

And once you find yours, you’ll begin to realize—your anxiety wasn’t a curse. It was a wake-up call. A system reboot. A chance to rebuild your life in a way that feels *authentic* to you.

---

It’s been 30 days.
I’m not “cured,” but I’m free.

Free from panic loops. Free from hating myself. Free from waiting for the next breakdown.

I hope this helps someone. Even one person. And if you want something to guide you step by step like it did for me, seriously check out [The Ultimate Anxiety Relief Bundle](https://www.anxietysupports.com/p/the-ultimate-anxiety-relief-bundle/6786cf4841f276dbe2af04d1). Not an ad, just one of the few things that actually delivered on its promise.

You’re not broken. You’re becoming.

Rooting for you.

Ball was angered. The pitch shook.     
And women, and supporters alike, struck down the old boys and moved their bodies to the sidelines — as spectators.

But in their progress, the hardliners forgot the secret of the game. They left its mystery on the pitch.

**We, who found it, are just supporters and players.** Not gods, well not all of us. Not giants. Just in love with the game.

And the secret of the game has always carried with it a mystery.     
You must learn its riddle, Angel City. You must learn its discipline.

For no one — *no one* — in this world can you trust.     
Not executives.     
Not pundits.     
And *especially* not gatekeepers.

**This you can trust:** *the ball.*

\-----------------------------

**UTAH ROYALS! WHAT IS BEST IN BALL?**     
The open field, teammates on your run, goals on the board, and the wind in your hair.

**WRONG!**

**ANGEL CITY! WHAT IS BEST IN BALL?**     
To crush your opponents, see the frustration on their coach's faces, and to hear the lamentations of their supporters!

**THAT IS GOOD!**

[**Match Hype**](https://youtu.be/LyhTxQwSwJU?si=BDBEcKqishbRxKin):

Your Ol' Pal Shlomo checking in. Another school day game, another early climb up the Mountain Top of Hype — makes it hard to enjoy a nice Eye-talian motor oil-grade cup of coffee, but here I am.

There she stood — our YASSS QUEEN — in a simple yet regal robe, her hair straighter than elegance defined.

Tired of the routine, I cried out:     
""I'm tired! We're finally home! We *better* win. We need your blessing!""

""Ah, what it is to be so impatient"", her response

""There was a time, when I was younger, when all I wanted was three points.     
When wins meant more than building something bigger.""

**""The riddle of the game?""** I asked**.**

""Yes, you know what it is, don’t you, Shlomo?"" she said.     
""Shall I tell you? It’s the least I can do for dragging you up here so early.""

**""Wins aren't enough. Culture is stronger.""**

""Look around you — there, in the stands.     
Those rapturous supporters.  
That is the culture we strive to mirror on the pitch.""

""What is a win without the spirit to carry it into the future?     
Look at that strength in the crowd.     
The desire in their eyes.""

*""A win without expectations is a waste.""*

""Contemplate this as you walk back down the Mountain, yearning for your cheap cup of coffee.""

**VOLEMOS!!!**

I hope you have all been properly hyped

1kiqe08,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1kiqe08/guide_to_cheaper_lunch_options_as_a_umich_student/,Guide to Cheaper Lunch Options as a UMich Student,"I always had to rush and grab a quick bite to eat in between classes during my undergrad. This was partially my fault but sometimes it just wasn’t convenient to walk back to my apartment, cook, and then walk back to central campus where all my classes were. This resulted in me eating out a lot. And I mean A LOT. I don’t wanna run the numbers but it was definitely really bad guys. As a graduate student who is hoping to be done in the fall, I’ve gotten a lot better at finding the cheaper lunch options and daily deals that Ann Arbor has to offer and I wanna share some of those with you guys! I realize that this is kinda coming at a weird time since most of us are home for the summer, but I am hoping this post will still be helpful to some folks anyways (and selfishly I have wanted to write something like this for a long time but never had enough info).

**Jamaican Jerk Pit Meat Patties:** This place is freaking amazing and you gotta try it for dinner sometime (it's reasonably priced) but if you're in need of something quick, cheap, and tasty, try their beef or chicken patties. They are Pop-Tart sized pockets of minced Jamaican meat surrounded by a buttery pie crust. Hearty, amazing, not to mention a quick in-and-out, and only for **$3.50!** They also offer veggie patties if you don't eat meat. JJP is located in the heart of central campus (sandwiched between the Panera on the corner and the Hill Auditorium) which will make it pretty easy to get to provided you're not on north campus.

**Monday's and Saturday's at Baba Dari:** On Mondays and Saturdays, Baba Dari offers chicken shawarma and falafel wraps for only **$4.99!** Not gonna lie, their wraps are just decent but I still think it's a reallyyy good deal for what you get. It's located across the street from the Cottage Inn Pizza on Packard and Hill, which makes it a little harder to get to than a lot of the other places on this list, but walking there, ordering, and eating shouldn't be longer than a 25 minute or so affair. I walk and eat fast though so times may vary a lil.

**$2 Tuesdays at NYPD (New York Pizza Depot ((not to be confused with the New York Police Department)):** Their pizza is pretty good. I personally think it is almost as good as Joe's but I am also kind of a Joe's hater so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I will say that every time I walked by NYPD on a Tuesday of this year, a line formed so large that it literally went out to the street which isn't really selling NYPD as a viable place to go to for lunch. However, from the few times I've walked by later in the afternoon, the line has seemed to die down a little (between like 2:00 and 4:00), which might be a good time to go if you don't mind having a later lunch! It is also located in a really good location; it is right by Skeeps and Tower Plaza on the corner of William and Maynard St. I am pretty sure the deal ends at 11:00 P.M. so go ahead and get $2 slices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if you want!

**No Thai:** No Thai is just the 'Ol Reliable. It's not gonna make you drool or get you super hype like a savory chorizo burger at Frita's might but it's pretty good, cheap, and really filling. I get the No Thai Fried Rice or the Drunken Fried Rice—both with chicken. It comes out to $10 or $11 (I forget I am sorry) but it gets me FULL. If I am having it for lunch, I probably only finish half of it and save the rest for dinner. There are several No Thai's on campus to accommodate all of the No Thai enjoyers. There is one on South U next to 7-Eleven which is the one that most of y'all will probably be going to. There is one in Kerrytown by Sparrow Market. There is one a little off campus on Main St by the Big House. But the one...the Le Gusteau's of No Thai's is the one on South Industrial by the Salvation Army and Campus Golf Course. They give you Michael Phelps portions guys. It is crazy. I am exaggerating a little but you could maybe feed three people on one No Thai Fried Rice from the South Industrial location. It's absolutely mental. It's an online-only ordering service and not many people know about it so I think they just don't care and give you infinite food LOL. It's definitely not in the best location but it's pretty walkable depending on where you are and Definitely bikeable.

**Sadako:** I am pretty sure this is the cheapest sushi you can get anywhere on campus and I think the cheapest I have seen anywhere. Their salmon and tuna rolls are HUGE, pretty tasty, and are only five bucks! One or two (if you are really hungry) of these with miso soup should do you right for lunch. For those that do not eat fish: avocado rolls are $4, cucumber rolls are $3, and the more elaborate vegetable rolls are around $5. It is located on South Forest and South University near Vertex Coffee making it a pretty good location to grab a quick bite.

**Backroom Pizza:** Backroom Pizza, unfortunately, is kinda known as the late night backup spot that people will only go to if they are (1) at or near Rick's and (2 ((and most importantly)) drunk. I will admit that the stars have to align a little bit for most people to walk into Backroom Pizza. I am one of those freaks, if you haven't already been able to tell, that has had sober Backroom Pizza in broad daylight many a times. I mess with it honestly. I won't even get their pizza. If I am going for lunch, I am getting three Bostco sticks and a Powerade which is around $5 to $6 if I remember correctly. Also, for non-Midwesterners: Bostco Sticks are unglorified breadsticks with processed (but gooey!) mozzarella cheese stuffed inside. I would normally only get two of these for lunch but I never have cash and they require a minimum of a $5 purchase if you wanna use your card. It is not the healthiest option but it is really cheap.

**Chipotle:** Everybody knows how solid Chipotle is. A burrito with any toppings you want is usually between $11 and $9.5 (provided you don't get guac) and I think a bowl is about the same price but I could be wrong about this. It's healthy, filling, tasty, reliable, and most importantly, very inexpensive. That's not the cheapest thing that you can get there though. If you really wanna save a buck, get a bowl and ask for two steamed tortillas on the side—these cost $0.50 to $0.65 depending on the location. After that, get double rice, double protein, double cheese, double sour cream, or double whatever else you want. The extra protein will cost you but you'll end up getting two large burritos for the cost of like $13 or $14—you might need to consult a YouTube video or two on how to wrap a burrito though. If you don't want a burrito, you can double everything for even cheaper.

**Costco:** Unrelated but *The* Costco Hot Dog is $1.50. Yep. I don't care how far you are. I don't care if you don't have a car. I don't care if you are on a diet. I don't care about anything. The Costco Hot Dog is $1.50 and that is just beautiful.

The list ends here because Ann Arbor is really expensive lol.

**Short Grift List (just my opinions)**

* Le Dog Le Soup (good but too expensive)
* Bo's Bagels \^
* Joe's Pizza \^
* Pizza House (decent and way too expensive)
* Beyond Juice \^
* Iggy's Eggies \^
* Maize and Blue Deli (KOG ((King of Grifts))

(2) Is it possible to make it so that the tap has the ability to dispense both nitro liquid and normal liquid depending on what we want to serve that day?

I just bought a precision 3.0+ (single sided) crank-style power meter. I use Strava on my Android to oversee my bike training and just bought a 4iiii powermeter. However, I have 3 questions regarding the 4iiii app. Oddly, I cannot find the answers to these questions online or in their suggested articles, nor in this Reddit group. I realize the problem may be that I am using Strava & the 4iiii apps on my phone and I should buy a bike computer like a Garmin, which I'm willing to do but I want to make sure that'll solve my problem first before I bite the bullet! 

1. When I stopped to get coffee midway through my ride, I pushed the stop button on the app so that it would not continue recording while I was having my break. However, when I returned to my bike, the workout had disappeared and so I lost all of that data. What should I do so that I don't lose data again in future? 

2. I have been using the 4iiii app to record my power, but since it only records my power values, I have to also record my bike ride on the Strava app. This means that I have 2 different records of the same workout on Strava, rather than them being integrated. How can I ensure they are integrated together into a single workout that combines the power data from my 4iiii power meter with all the other data that Strava records?  

3. How do I smooth out my power number in the app so that they don't look so jumpy? I'd like them to be smoothed so that I'm seeing my 3 second or 5 second blended average, but don't see an option to do so using the 4iiii app.  

Thank you.

My work is about a 5 min drive to the DMV so I got in virtual line yesterday at 2:30. (Go to DMV website -> Appointments -> Get In Line)  I was #38 in line. I watched my place in line tick down over the next hour. At 3:30 I was #15 in line so I figured my number would be up a little after 4pm. When I was at #10, I left work early at 3:50 and went to the DMV. I also got a text to say to make my way to the entrance.  Here's the best part: you don't wait in line AT ALL. Walk past the non-appointment line and walk past the people in line checking in for their appt. Just walk in and sit down to wait for your number to get called.  I got called up at about 4:15 or so. Easy peasy.

  
Also, the parking lot there is way too small for the amount of people they are serving. You will circle around and there are no spots. Park around the corner on Grand Ave in front the the LB health building. It's a 2 block walk but way less stress. 

I basically spent about 20 minutes in the DVM, got my RealID renewed and it was a breeze. I feel like I got away with something! If you have a morning or afternoon off and were planning on spending hours in the DMV, get in the online line and at least wait out the hours at home or in a coffee shop. 

The DMV sucks. Hope this helps someone reduce their frustration with the process. ",74,1746816616.0,longbeach,8,0.99,False

Hi Team,

It’s that magical time of year again! No, not the holidays—*the season of adulting*! HR has gently reminded us that it’s time to craft your 2025 performance goals. Think of this as your chance to sprinkle some ✨glitter glue✨ on the year ahead.

**The Deal:**

* Your goals should be **written with your manager** (aka your “direct report coach/cheerleader/human reminder to eat lunch”).
* Goals must **not** include “doing my actual job” (e.g., “breathing,” “surviving Zoom meetings,” or “remembering where the ‘reply all’ button lives”). Instead, aim for **system upgrades** or **big-picture wins** that make our workplace feel like it’s been hit by a productivity fairy. 🧚♂️

**Brainstorming Ideas (because ‘staring into the void’ isn’t a goal):**

* **Professional Development:** “Become a Spreadsheet Wizard” or “Learn to Say ‘Synergy’ Without Laughing.”
* **Productivity & Efficiency:** “Befriend the ‘Mute’ Button” or “Cut Meeting Times by Inventing a PowerPoint Karaoke Rule.”
* **Collaboration & Communication:** “Host a ‘No-Jargon’ Day” or “High-Five Someone in a Different Time Zone.”
* **Innovation & Initiative:** “Suggest a Coffee Machine Upgrade” or “Volunteer to Fix the Printer… Just Once.”

Remember: These goals should feel less like a chore and more like a gym membership you’ll *actually* use. (No judgment if January-you is wildly optimistic.)

**Deadline:** Get these to your manager by \[insert date here\]. Pro tip: Bribes involving baked goods *may* speed up approval. 🍪

Let’s make 2025 the year we all level up!

You know those mornings when getting out of bed feels impossible? I remember them all too well. During my darkest days with PPD, I started something so simple that it almost seemed silly at first - I kept a notebook by my bed. Nothing fancy, just a dollar store notebook that quickly became covered in coffee stains and baby spit-up. Every morning, I'd write just one word about how I was feeling. Just one. Sometimes it was ""tired"" or ""scared"" or even just ""blah."" But that tiny act of acknowledging my feelings became my anchor.

Looking back now, I can see how these tiny moments of self-care and awareness gradually helped me find my way through the fog. It wasn't about dramatic changes or perfect routines. It was about finding those small moments of peace in the chaos of new motherhood.

Originally from Vancouver, been in Alberta since 2011, and a digital nomad since 2019. I know my way around the city and just got back in time for summer :)

I’ve already gone through a few posts for recommendations, but I have some specific requests. I trust Reddit folk more than Google reviews or TripAdvisor SEO crap. 

**Food**  
I usually eat alone and prefer hole-in-the-wall spots with solid food.

Any good *pho* places that aren’t crazy overpriced? I went to Lotus yesterday—decent taste, but $24 for a large bowl (with tip) felt steep. Maybe that’s the going rate now, or maybe Lotus is a bit on the fancier side?  
Sushi spots worth checking out?  
BBQ duck recommendations?  
A friend mentioned there’s a place on #5 with a bunch of restaurants in one shared space—kind of like a food court but different. He couldn’t remember the name though—anyone know what that might be?

**Work Stuff**  
Any good co-working spaces or coffee shops to work from a few times a week? I don’t mind paying for day passes if the space is solid.  
Are there any good meetups or networking groups for web-based businesses? I’m open to going into Vancouver if there’s something worth it. Not into crypto bros or dropshipping hustle culture—cool startups are more my scene.

**Gym**  
I found a helpful thread here about gyms—leaning toward joining a community center for the affordability and chill vibes. I know RFS is popular, but I’ve heard it’s a younger crowd with lots of influencers, which isn’t really my thing.

Appreciate any recommendations you can share!

I have cut back on caffeine recently because it's been messing me up, but it's a tough habit to kick since I get caffeine headaches.


Last night, I stayed up until around 2:30 am after getting wrapped up in a book. I did have a 10 oz cup of coffee at 5:00 pm, so maybe that contributed to staying awake. I got up around 6:00 am today. I haven't yawned once, I can think more clearly, and I'm more focused. I mentally feel better, less stressed and anxious. It's so weird.


I usually sleep from 9 or 10 pm until 6 am. Was my sleep quality before last night so poor that getting 8-9 hours of sleep was making me more tired?
Was I front loading my day with so much caffeine that I crashed hard at night and wasn't sleeping well?
Was reading in the quiet with my cat the mental break I needed, and that's why I feel better?

I've been reflecting deeply on my absence during your time of greatest need. My failure to be present for you—both physically and emotionally—was inexcusable, particularly when you've consistently been my rock during my own difficult moments. I recognize now that my absence left you to navigate those turbulent waters alone, something wife should ever have to experience. The trust we built over years was damaged by my thoughtlessness, and I understand completely if that wound still feels raw.

I am truly sorry for letting you down. No excuses can justify my behavior; I should have been there, period. Your companionship has always been a lighthouse guiding me through storms, and when you needed that same beacon, I was nowhere to be found. The realization of how I've hurt you weighs heavily on my heart, and I'm consumed with regret for the pain my absence caused during what was already an overwhelming time for you.

Moving forward, I'm committed to rebuilding whatever trust I can. I've reorganized my priorities to ensure I'm more responsive and present. I've set reminders to check in regularly, not just during crises but during everyday moments too. I've also begun working with a therapist to address my tendency to withdraw when others need support—a pattern I'm determined to break. Most importantly, I promise to listen more attentively to understand your needs rather than assuming I know what's best.

Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? I understand healing takes time, and I'm prepared to demonstrate through consistent actions that I can be dependable again. If you're willing, perhaps we could meet for coffee when you feel ready to talk about what support looks like for you. Or if you prefer, I'll respect whatever boundaries you need to set. The path to rebuilding our relationship is yours to determine, and I'll honor whatever decision brings you peace.

With deepest remorse and hope,

1kipnba,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kipnba/does_the_btootos_a90_pro_wireless_earbuds_review/,Does the Btootos A90 Pro Wireless Earbuds Review Reveal True Value for Money?,"Testing gadgets like the Btootos A90 PRO Wireless Earbuds is always an exciting venture for a tech enthusiast like me. From the moment I unboxed these earbuds, I could sense their potential. They caught my eye with their sleek rose gold design and neatly organized accessories, including silicone ear tips in multiple sizes, a charging case, and a USB-C cable. Being as nitpicky as I am with audio equipment, I was intrigued to see whether they lived up to their promise of passive noise cancellation, long battery life, and ergonomic comfort.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of these earbuds certainly leans toward elegance with a modern aesthetic. The rose gold finish isn’t just about looks; it gives off a premium vibe without being overbearing. Picking them up, I noticed the earbuds were incredibly lightweight, which is a blessing for those long listening sessions. The silicone ear tips provided a snug fit, and I was thrilled with the IP7 waterproof rating—no worries about sweaty workouts or unexpected rain. The charging case also stood out with its ergonomic design and LED power display that kept me informed about battery levels at all times.

**Convenience and Pairing Experience**  
Connectivity with these earbuds was straightforward. Equipped with Bluetooth 5.4, the pairing process was seamless, connecting instantly to both my iPhone and laptop. As someone often juggling between devices, the multi-device compatibility made things super convenient. Whether I was on a Zoom call or running errands, the range of up to 15 meters ensured I didn’t have to keep my phone glued to my side. On one occasion, I even left my phone upstairs and stayed connected flawlessly while making coffee downstairs.

**Highlights**  
- Seamless Bluetooth 5.4 connection ensured stable and fast pairing with multiple devices.  
- Ergonomic and lightweight design enhanced comfort even during hours of wear.  
- IP7 waterproof rating provided peace of mind during outdoor activities or workouts.  

[See Btootos A90 PRO deals on Amazon now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cx1tj228/)

**Sound Quality and Performance**  
The sound quality is, without a doubt, the make-or-break factor for any earbuds. The A90 PRO did not disappoint, although there’s a bit to unpack here. The 14.2mm dynamic drivers delivered a commendable performance with deep bass and crisp highs, perfect for my playlists that range from Lo-Fi beats to heavy rock. Where these earbuds shine is in phone calls—ENC noise reduction technology made every conversation crystal clear, even when I was in a noisy café. However, the passive noise cancellation could struggle at times in particularly noisy environments. It’s not a dealbreaker, but if you’re expecting the isolation of high-end active noise cancellation, keep your expectations in check.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
On one charge, I managed to squeeze around 7 hours of playtime, which aligns perfectly with the advertised range. Paired with the charging case, the total playtime extended close to 36 hours. Charging it back up was swift with the USB-C port, and the LED display on the case made it simple to track the battery status. This kind of battery life is a lifesaver on back-to-back calls and extended gym sessions. However, one slight annoyance was the 1.5-hour charging time for the case—it’s not particularly slow, but it could be a smidge faster considering the competitive market.

**Good Points**  
- Excellent sound performance, particularly for bass-heavy music and clear calls.  
- Long battery life of up to 36 hours with the case, making it ideal for uninterrupted use.  
- Reliable ENC noise reduction technology for clear phone calls even in noisy environments.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Passive noise cancellation struggles in extremely loud environments.  
- Charging case could benefit from a slightly faster recharge cycle.  

**Competing Options**  
Comparing these earbuds to rivals like the Anker Soundcore Life P3 or the Jabra Elite 3, a few strengths and compromises become apparent. The Btootos A90 PRO excels in style, comfort, and its impressive IP7 waterproof rating—a feature not all competitors at the same price point offer. Meanwhile, the Jabra Elite 3 offers slightly stronger passive noise isolation, and the Soundcore Life P3 provides a more customizable EQ through its app. For casual users or fitness enthusiasts, the rose-gold marvel stacks up well, though audiophiles may lean toward alternatives with adjustable sound profiles.

**True Value**  
From a cost-efficiency perspective, these earbuds deliver remarkable value. They’re packed with features that surprised me at this price, such as the elegant build quality, ENC for calls, and extended battery life. While they don’t compete with high-end models like AirPods Pro in active noise cancellation, they hold their own remarkably well in the midrange market. Considering their capabilities, these earbuds feel like they’re punching above their weight, making them a worthy investment for anyone hunting for balanced quality and affordability.

Here's an Honest Review,"After a  week at Panama Jack Resort in Cancun and wanted to share my experience. If you're considering a family-friendly, all-inclusive vacation, this place has a lot to offer.

Location**:** Situated in Cancun's Hotel Zone, it's close to shopping and nightlife but still offers a sense of seclusion.

Room**:** Cozy and clean with Caribbean-inspired decor. I stayed in an ocean-view suite with a hammock on the balcony—perfect for relaxing afternoons.

Dining**:** The buffet at Ventanas offers a great variety, especially fresh fruit and pastries in the morning. Casa de Rosa serves authentic Mexican food and became our dinner favorite. Panama Jack Coffee Co. is a must-visit for cinnamon rolls and iced coffee.

Pools & Activities**:** The main pool has an ocean view and a shallow area suitable for kids. There's also a pirate-themed splash park that was a hit with the little ones. Daily activities include yoga, cooking classes, and nightly entertainment.

Staff**:** Friendly and always helpful, enhancing the overall experience.

Keep in mind! 

Crowds. The pool and beach areas can get crowded, especially during peak times.

Dining Wait Times.  Some a-la-carte restaurants have longer wait times during peak hours.

Atmosphere It's a lively, family-oriented resort, so if you're seeking total peace and quiet, this might not be the ideal spot.[CancunOpinion.com](https://cancunopinion.com/panama-jack-hotel-in-cancun-honest-review-and-opinion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Overall, Panama Jack Resort Cancun offers a fun and relaxing family vacation experience. The combination of good food, beautiful views, and great service makes it a place I'd consider returning to.

1kipm5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1kipm5d/mothers_day_weekend_suggestions_not_necessarily/,Mother’s Day Weekend suggestions (not necessarily for Moms),"My sisters, two aunts and my mom have decided (a little last-minute) that they're coming to KC for a Ladies Weekend. They're arriving late tonight and leaving at 6am Sunday morning to spend Mother's Day with their own kids. We're all best friends, and my mom and aunts are very social and engaged and physically active in their personal lives as well, so they're down for anything. Our group is like six sisters in their late 30's. 


We don't carry phones when we're on vacation (no TikTok/Insta/Facebook, no pictures of food/posing in front of everything, and no interruptions from the real world), so it helps to have a couple places/areas/events in mind and general background/hours/tips. If a place is better for lunch, or if an event is technically all day, but the best part doesn't happen until 10pm, that helps to know!


I'm looking for anything that's geared toward adults, not necessarily focused on the ""Mom"" of it all. We'll be going out for lunch and dinner. Nowhere too upscale-we'll be in jeans and blouses, not looking for a celebratory dinner. A delicious local place is great! My mom and aunts love food tv, so if it's been featured on Food Network, Cooking, or the Travel channel, that's a cool bonus, but not the focus (please don't send us to Grinders or Guy's Taco Hell in P&L). We're adventurous eaters, so we're open to all cuisines!!


We also love bars in or out of restaurants-we really love artsy bartenders, bars/cocktails with a theme, unique barware, flowers/fruit/glitter, really cool names, smoke/fire, etc. Nothing says ""vacation"" like a sexy drink!!! We love the pageantry and creativity. 


We also like shopping, but not really chain stores/malls- we can shop there any other time. Local shops that are in the same general neighborhood is great, but we'll go out of our way to check out anything really cool. We're definitely going to Donna's Dress Shop, so any suggestions around there would be cool, too! We love unique jewelry/art/clothing, local foods/crafts, sports-related stuff, *anything* Mexican (we're Mexican, love shopping local Mexican places for unique stuff) and I'm Gothica Chicana, so any goth/horror style stuff, really anything in that vein is worth checking out for me!


We're definitely going to City Market Saturday morning and Donna's Dress Shop, so any suggestions about literally any place while we're in that neighborhood, please let me know!!! We usually break into pairs when we shop, we all love a good stroll, and we always try to buy something if we go into a business, so even if it's just a cool coffee place a couple blocks away, shout it out-someone always needs a drink or a snack! If we don't make it there while they're here, I promise I'll go myself!!

After thoroughly testing this stroller, I've noted its remarkable strengths and a few quirky downsides. Sit back, and I’ll unpack my experience.

**Practical Design and Compact Build**

Right out of the box, the lightweight design struck a balance between sturdy construction and easy portability. The alloy steel frame feels durable without tipping into the heavyweight category. At around 18 pounds, folding it up and tossing it into the trunk of my somewhat cramped car was a breeze. When unfolded, the stroller impressively fits through standard-width doors (a lifesaver in grocery store aisles!). Even though it’s compact, it doesn’t compromise on accommodating my two kids comfortably.

**Standout Safety and Comfort Features**

The five-point harness system with soft shoulder pads and reflective material is a standout. My twins are, to put it lightly, energetic, and having a stroller that not only securely straps them in but also ensures they’re visible in dim conditions is great. The extendable polyester-mesh canopies offer additional sun protection, a feature that proved invaluable during sunny days at the park. Reclining seats with multiple positions made nap time possible, even on the go.

[Check Delta Children 11708-2271 Scout Double Stroller price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b01l7c479y/)

**Smooth Performance on Diverse Terrains**

With 5.5-inch wheels equipped with suspension and front swivel capabilities, this stroller handled cracked sidewalks and uneven surfaces like a champ. I took it on a dirt trail on a whim, and while it isn’t a jogging stroller, it performed decently. Let’s just say my twins enjoyed the slightly bumpy ride more than I expected. However, for sand or rough gravel, you might need something a bit more robust.

**Advantages**

- Lightweight design makes it simple to fold, carry, and store.
- Safety features, including the harness and reflective accents, provide peace of mind.
- Generous storage with double rear canopy bags helps carry diapers, snacks, and coffee cups.
- Fits seamlessly through 30-inch wide doors, which makes it ideal for urban living.
  
**Areas for Improvement**

- While the stroller is manageable, unfolding it sometimes feels like wrestling with a sleepy bear—it takes patience and technique.
- The storage bags are functional but not the most accessible when in full motion.
  
**Competitive Options**

Compared to other tandem strollers like the Baby Trend Sit N’ Stand or the Britax B-Lively Double, this model excels in affordability and lightweight portability. Unlike the Britax B-Lively, which feels bulkier, this one is easier to maneuver in tight spaces. Baby Trend’s model, however, has the jump seat for older children, which this stroller lacks. The lack of compatibility with car seats might steer some parents toward other options, but the added safety features here more than make up for it in daily use.

**Cost Efficiency**

Investing in this stroller seemed like the most wallet-friendly option without cutting corners on key features. For parents looking for a solid mid-range buy that delivers both safety and comfort, this one ticks the boxes. It’s not luxury-tier but works for everyday use—making it smart spending in my book.

1kipiwz,https://i.redd.it/x4q22l6ttsze1.jpeg,Wander Free with $USDX Staking,"
Travel the world while earning passive income, here’s how I do it with WhiteRock’s $USDX stablecoin.
I’m bargaining in Bangkok’s vibrant markets, hiking Santorini’s cliffs, and sipping coffee in Paris. This isn’t a fantasy, it’s my life, fueled by passive income from staking WhiteRock’s $USDX stablecoin. With a steady 5% APR and risk-free stability, I travel the world while my money grows. Here’s how it works.

**Why Passive Income Matters**
Passive income is freedom. It’s money working for you while you chase adventures. Staking $USDX lets me fund my travels without stress. As a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, $USDX offers predictable returns, no crypto rollercoasters.

**What Makes $USDX Special**
WhiteRock’s $USDX is my travel companion:  
5% APR: Stake and earn 5% annually, like a high-yield savings account with crypto flexibility.  

**Low-Risk:** Tied to Treasury bonds, it avoids crypto volatility.  

Simple: Set up staking on WhiteRock’s platform and watch your earnings grow.
A $10,000 stake generates $500 a year, enough for flights or hotel stays. My principal stays safe, funding trips from Bali to Norway.

**Travel Meets Financial Freedom**
$USDX earnings let me say yes to spontaneous adventures. Whether I’m exploring Marrakech or relaxing in Tokyo, my stablecoin stake covers costs without market worries. It’s the backbone of my nomadic lifestyle.

**Start Your Journey**
Want to trade desks for destinations? Visit WhiteRock’s platform to stake $USDX. Research risks (like platform security), but for me, $USDX’s stability is a game-changer. Pack your bags and let passive income fuel your dreams.

1kipidv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1kipidv/how_do_you_deal_with_nihilism/,How do you deal with Nihilism?,"There are days when I wake up, kind of ""Naturally Pre-Disposed to this Experience"". 

Not that I want to go through that per se. But I wake up, immersed in this Spiral. The ""Nihilistic Spiral"". 

I wake up like this. And this feeling is ""sucking me down the drain"".

It starts with Light Sensations and even ""Silly"", as soon as I wake up. 

- A certain Coldness.

- A certain Frigidity.

- A certain Emotional Withdrawal.

- A certain Apathy. 

- A certain Generalized Disinterest.

- A certain Existential Void. 

- The feeling that ""nothing matters"".


Sometimes I wake up feeling all of this.

In a very light way.

In Very Mild Degrees. 


But ""From Grain to Grain, the Rooster Fills the Talk"".


Start Light. But, if I ignore this, or just let it run on ""Auto"". 

These sensations become somatized. 

Until I bury myself. And Paralyze me.


Like Quicksand. 


I can't stop Nihilism from occurring to me sometimes. He always appears without my authorization. But, with time, practice, experience, a lot of reflection and a lot of research. Little by little I learned to deal with this experience. Without giving me too much despair. And at the same time, without being Neglectful with this Sensation. Well, ignoring it only makes it worse. ""Closing Your Eyes"" Doesn't Solve the Problem.

In These Moments. I try to hold on to something, anything, minimally significant. Simple things, like carefully tasting a cup of coffee. Paying attention to the smallest details. 

I try to hallucinate something.

Anything. 

That makes me feel like I'm Alive. 

And it's worth it, to be Alive. 


I try to connect with people, interact, share my feelings and thoughts. Well, I know that isolating myself also only makes this feeling worse.

In those moments. Depending on the Degree of Nihilism. My Soul gets so Desperate for Meaning. That sometimes I can give birth to a Creative Fury within me. I feel taken by an Intense Inspiration. Which Symbolizes my Inner Struggle, against Nihilism. 

A Bold Reaction. Against Emotional and Existential Drowning. 

An attempt to ""Create Sense from Zero"".

""Getting Milk from Stone"". 


Because, everyone who goes through a Nihilistic Experience, Knows. How difficult it is to find Meaning in these moments. And it is precisely, through this Experience, that we have the Opportunity to Give New Meaning to our Existence. And notice things we had never noticed before.  

Because, whoever feels happy easily and through superficial things. It has everything, even if it has nothing.

The Nihilist Fall. Destroy this Paradise. And Challenges us to Rebuild our Happiness from Scratch.

It's a Nagging Discomfort. 

A Demanding Teacher.

That Forces us to Discover and Produce, Infinite Paths to Happiness. 

Well, none of them are fully sufficient. 

You always fall again. 


And this is how we learn:

- Always Starting Over.

- Always reinvent yourself.

- Be Creative.

- Expand Consciousness. 

- Go Beyond.

I wake up like this. And this feeling is ""sucking me down the drain"".

It starts with Light Sensations and even ""Silly"", as soon as I wake up. 

- A certain Coldness.

- A certain Frigidity.

- A certain Emotional Withdrawal.

- A certain Apathy. 

- A certain Generalized Disinterest.

- A certain Existential Void. 

- The feeling that ""nothing matters"".

In Very Mild Degrees.

Start Light. But, if I ignore this, or just let it run on ""Auto"". 

These sensations become somatized. 

Until I bury myself. And Paralyze me.


Like Quicksand. 


I can't stop Nihilism from occurring to me sometimes. He always appears without my authorization. But, with time, practice, experience, a lot of reflection and a lot of research. Little by little I learned to deal with this experience. Without giving me too much despair. And at the same time, without being Neglectful with this Sensation. Well, ignoring it only makes it worse. ""Closing Your Eyes"" Doesn't Solve the Problem.

In These Moments. I try to hold on to something, anything, minimally significant. Simple things, like carefully tasting a cup of coffee. Paying attention to the smallest details. 

I try to hallucinate something.

Anything. 

That makes me feel like I'm Alive. 

And it's worth it, to be Alive. 


I try to connect with people, interact, share my feelings and thoughts. Well, I know that isolating myself also only makes this feeling worse.

In those moments. Depending on the Degree of Nihilism. My Soul gets so Desperate for Meaning. That sometimes I can give birth to a Creative Fury within me. I feel taken by an Intense Inspiration. Which Symbolizes my Inner Struggle, against Nihilism. 

A Bold Reaction. Against Emotional and Existential Drowning. 

An attempt to ""Create Sense from Zero"".

""Getting Milk from Stone"". 


Because, everyone who goes through a Nihilistic Experience, Knows. How difficult it is to find Meaning in these moments. And it is precisely, through this Experience, that we have the Opportunity to Give New Meaning to our Existence. And notice things we had never noticed before.  

Because, whoever feels happy easily and through superficial things. It has everything, even if it has nothing.

Is it worth the upgrade?  As far as I know, it uses the same brew unit, and the difference is mainly a better display, but also more drink options.  Honestly, don’t know how often we will use the drink options- I typically drink either a coffee, or an espresso, while my wife rarely drinks coffee, but when she does it’s a latte of some sort.

Anything else I should consider as far as considering the Plus?

I am not considering any other machines, as these are the two in stock nearby and I really want a replacement machine today.

1kipca2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kipca2/does_the_mr_coffee_14_cup_programmable_coffee/,Does the Mr. Coffee 14 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker Truly Impress Review?,"The Mr. Coffee 2143561 14 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker has recently taken up precious counter space in my kitchen, and as someone who relies on caffeine like it's a life source, I decided to put it to the test. The product promises features like a large brewing capacity, strong brew settings, and a reusable filter. I was curious about whether these claims would stand up to the daily grind...pun intended.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker certainly has a sleek, modern aesthetic. With a silver, matte exterior finish, it doesn’t stick out like an awkward appliance but rather blends seamlessly with the other stainless steel gadgets in my kitchen. Its dimensions—8.7""D x 11.4""W x 15.1""H—might make it a bit bulky for smaller countertops, but with a machine capable of brewing 14 cups of coffee, you kind of expect it to take up some room. I also appreciated how sturdy it felt; it doesn’t wobble or seem cheaply made. However, the buttons felt slightly plasticky under my fingertips. For a device touted as “premium,” I think more tactile satisfaction in the interface would have enhanced the experience.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
This isn’t just a regular drip coffee machine—it’s an overachiever. Brewing for a family gathering? It delivers a whopping 14 cups without breaking a sweat. On days when it's just me sipping away in my solitude, the Small Batch setting comes in clutch, allowing me to brew just 1-4 cups without sacrificing quality. The Advanced Showerhead Technology ensures that coffee grounds are evenly saturated, which does seem to make the coffee richer in flavor.

The Strong Brew Selector is, quite frankly, a lifesaver for mornings when I'm barely functioning. It consistently produced a bolder, more robust cup of coffee when required. My only gripe is that it takes a touch longer to brew stronger coffee, which isn’t ideal if you’re racing against the clock.

[See Mr. Coffee 2143561 deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c8ryg85n/)

**Ease of Use and Programmability**  
As a person scraping by in the mornings until I've had my first cup, I really appreciated the programmable features. I could set the Brew Later function before bed, ensuring that freshly brewed coffee would be ready as soon as I stumbled into the kitchen. The buttons for programming are intuitive enough, and even my technologically challenged cousin managed to figure it out during his visit. The Keep Warm setting was another positive—I could keep my coffee hot for up to four hours, adjusting the warmth as needed to avoid burning that delightful liquid fuel. Call it lazy, but not having to reheat coffee was a game-changer.

That being said, the automated cleaning cycle feature was a bit of a double-edged sword. While it's brilliant in theory—attempting to extend the machine’s lifespan and keeping coffee-tasting fresh—the cleaning process is quite noisy. It’s not something I’d want to schedule for the early morning unless I wanted to risk waking the whole house.

**Favorable Attributes**  
Here are some of this coffee maker’s standout points:  
- The reusable nylon filter not only makes this machine more eco-friendly but is also dishwasher safe, making clean-up a breeze.  
- The Advanced Water Filtration system removes up to 97% of chlorine, noticeably improving the taste of the coffee.  
- The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause function allows for a sneaky sip mid-brew for those impatient moments.  
- The adjustable Keep Warm setting is perfect for slow coffee sippers like me.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product gets everything right, and this coffee maker isn’t without its quirks:  
- The Brew Later programming lacks an indicator to confirm it’s properly set, so I had to double-check several times.  
- The exterior, while sleek in style, smudges easily and requires more frequent cleaning than I’d like.  
- It’s not the quietest coffee maker during operation—and let’s not even talk about the cleaning cycle racket.  

**Competing Products**  
The coffee machine market is fierce, and during my research, I came across a few worthy competitors to the Mr. Coffee 2143561. One of them is the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, known for its adjustable temperature control and stylish design. Compared to it, the Mr. Coffee model pulls ahead with its larger 14-cup capacity and the Advanced Water Filtration system. Keurig K-Duo is another contender, offering the advantage of both single-serve coffee and a carafe. However, Keurig relies on K-Cups for its single-serve options, which didn’t feel as eco-friendly as the reusable filter included here. 

Where the rival models outshine, though, is in their quieter operation. While Mr. Coffee offers exceptional functionality, the high noise levels during cleaning and brewing are points where both the Cuisinart and Keurig slightly edge it out. 

**Value for Money**  
After trying it out consistently, I feel it strikes a good balance between affordability and performance. Its robust set of features—from programmable brewing to water filtration—backs up the price. That being said, there are other similarly priced models that offer alternative benefits like lower noise levels or a more compact design. Whether this machine feels worth the investment depends heavily on what you're prioritizing—family-sized brewing capacity, eco-awareness, or a better tasting morning cup.

1kipbwu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kipbwu,"Ideas for curtains, accent pillows, and a rug?","I want some curtains to liven up the living room, kitchen nook, and dining room windows. But I can't find a style or color that really fits without making it look like an old lady's house (note: the dining room is getting repainted, likely in a sage-ish green on top and white on bottom). I also can't decide what coordinating colors I want for my accent pillows on the couch, or what color rug under the coffee table may help liven the place up.

I've also been considering painting the fireplace wall of the living room either a terracotta orange-red, or the same sage green as I'm planning in the dining room, or a lighter neutral beige that will still contrast enough with the fireplace and the sandy tan in the rest of the house. I'm thinking a light cream colored, or perhaps sage, curtain would go best in any of these cases. I attached a living room inspiration photo and a photo of some color swatches in the dining room. Having thought about it more though, given that it's not a super large living room (16x15'), I'm thinking a lighter colored accent wall would be better than darker.
