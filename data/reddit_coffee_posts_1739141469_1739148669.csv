1iltxqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iltxqa/can_you_provide_advice_on_using_the_leverpresso/,Can you provide advice on using the Leverpresso more efficiently?,"I am new to manual espresso shots and am looking for strategies for using the Leverpresso Pro more efficiently.

My biggest issue so far is the time it takes to prep and pull a shot. Would a flair have been a better choice? Would a portafilter and tamping prep stand make a significant difference? At least many traditional tamp stations would work. Everything with Leverpresso takes more time. Particularly if I am trying to pull multiple shots.

I am getting the flair power tower for the 1zpresso J-ultra to remove the hand-grinding aspect. For Aeropress, I use pre-ground coffee or my Breville smart grinder Pro. The J-ultra is much better for the Leverpresso, but it is time-consuming.

I also stopped using the Leverpresso Pro stand. For pre-heating, I can just put the top half in my sink and run hot water through it. But not using the stand means I can’t use a measuring cup or a scale underneath to measure output.

Could people share their workflows and identify what made them more efficient? I am willing to buy anything that saves time or reduces complexity.

Thoughts? Suggestions? I need to get the time closer to the efficiency of the Aeropress.

1iltxew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1iltxew/amway_and_other_mlms_are_recruiting_in_reno/,"Amway and other MLMs are recruiting in Reno, please be careful.  They are pretending to be “e-commerce” businesses with different names.","They are recruiting strangers in public places in Reno and the surrounding areas including retailers. coffee shops, and public parks.  They will invite you out for a coffee or zoom “interview.”

Amway and many other MLM consultants are operating “businesses” that have their own unique names (ex. Sierra top level marketing, Desert high ticket solutions), so it appears to be an independent small business but is actually part of a large corporation.  

Due to the negative press about MLMs, these corporations now have consultants operate their “business” under a different name.  They also try to hide the fact that they are an MLM.  

I asked if they were from Amway, then shocked Pikachu face.  Also, asking what company you are invited to work for is not “coming out of left field.”  

Some of these people may be genuinely nice but do not realize the MLM company is predatory.  It is also very hard to tell if they are genuinely nice or faking it because that is how MLM recruiters target people.  ",2,1739148404.0,Reno,0,1.0,False
1iltwqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iltwqy/adhd_med_efficacy_and_whatever_is_happening_to_me/,ADHD med efficacy and whatever is happening to me,"34/f/196 lbs

Meds are Adderall XR 10 mg (this mg for about 4 years, but I've taken it since high school and at a much larger dose back then.) Trintellix 20 mg and Lamictal 100 mg. B12 and vitamin D. Once a day for all. 

I have had a blood test and am going to the doctor on Monday. Blood test came back seemingly normal, but I haven't had anyone explain it to me yet. That's for Monday. 

I'm not sure what's going on. It feels like my meds half stopped working and my emotions became incredibly flat, no one and nothing feels real and time feels nonexistent. 

Timeline:

Had a period where my left arm and leg started becoming 'numb' or just felt like I lost awareness of them. Eventually got better after a few weeks. Then suddenly my right foot would feel warm and wet on and off throughout the day. It's become much less frequent as of now, I think. 

Had a few days where I felt tired and sniffly. The weather was warming up, so I figured it was having a weird reaction to that. It wouldnt be the first time weather going from cold to warm made me tired. Was on my period, which is highly regular. It ended uncharacteristically early. 

Ran out of melatonin so I took a new brand of 10 mg melatonin (my usual.)

Next day, started feeling weird, blew it off as illness or the weather.

Over the next few days everything and everyone stopped feeling real. My emotions became very flat. Social anxiety ramped up. EXTREME, debilitating fatigue. Zero focus or sense of time. Arms and legs have feeling but somehow don't. A depression unlike anything I've ever felt before. Began feeling suicidal because I spent 4 days feeling trapped behind glass with no way out, so I texted a hotline and called friends. 

On the third night my friend gave me a brand of melatonin I've used. I got rid of the other stuff and started using this one, which is 5 mg instead. 

Today, the morning was rough and I felt unsteady. Started to feel a tad better after taking my Adderall and drinking some coffee. Emotions felt like they were coming back some. 

I'm staying at a friend's house this weekend and I still don't feel entirely there, but something seems to be improves a bit. This sounds weird, but sometimes the Adderall side effects of anxiety helped me keep on track and I'm really feeling very little, which isn't great for my productivity, which I already suffer with. The world still feels weird and somewhat dreamy.

Additional: 

About a month and a half before all this I had a terrible ear infection. It took weeks to go away and my right ear really siffered. I ended up seemingly contracting it again but much more mild. Seemed to go away, but my right ear still bothers me and still has some muffling. Pretty positive I have TMJ as it also runs in my family. 

My neck and back have been bothering me on and off. I'm a top heavy girl who also has the habit most of us have of looking down at my phone. As of about 3 weeks ago it's started to feel like something in my neck was rubbing against something else. Very uncomfortable.

Frankly I'm scared and weirded out. I'm afraid I'll never feel normal again, or that something in my brain or nerves broke and my meds will never work again, which is the only thing that's helped me with ADHD and depression. When I talked to my original PCP, he told me that going to a mental health facility could be a good idea. I decided to make an appointment with someone else in the same office so I can get perspective from a doctor that hasn't known me since high school. I'll be seeing her Monday. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or heard of such a thing? The only times I can think that are even remotely similar are when I've had really bad infections and for some reason those messed with how well my meds worked before getting better again. Thing is, other than some ear clogging, I don't feel sick. Is like to bump up my Adderall from 10 to 15 if  I don't get better by next refill. I'm terrified they'll decide they won't let me. I'm a mess all around. ",1,1739148343.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1iltsri,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iltsri/i_saw_my_shadow_blink/,I Saw My Shadow Blink,"You know that weird feeling when you just know you're missing something but you swear you grabbed everything on your way out the door? Sure some may claim anxiety or just general forgetfulness, but I would have sworn on my life that something was missing as my engine finally sparked and I slowly inched my way out of my driveway. And before you say anything, I had been planning on getting the spark plugs replaced for over a month, but every time I thought about it, they started working just enough again to give me confidence in pushing it back a couple more days. Sure I stalled out here and there, but the money I saved by ignoring the issue was worth every annoyance it brought. Soon enough, the sputtering of my engine filled my ears, breaking the seal on the the deafening silence I had been subjected to thus far. 

Normally my 45 minute daily drive would be accompanied by music, or occasionally a spooky stories podcast when new episodes dropped, but this morning I couldn't bring myself to drown out my thoughts with the bickering of two friends with microphones. That feeling... that... emptiness. It made me feel uneasy. I went over the things I needed for work in my head at least 100 times on my way in. Phone, wallet, keys, work keys, name tag, laptop, files, and readers. Everything was accounted for, all in the spots I had left them the night before. And now all thrown in the passenger's seat next to me. As I exited my neighborhood, I saw what looked like the aftermath of a poor guy getting kicked out of the house. A pair of shoes, shorts, and a tank lay on the ground, followed by another pair of shorts and some running shoes further up. As I approached the site of the chaos, a complete mess of clothes, shoes, and even a couple bikes seemed to be strewn about haphazardly, getting more dense as they approached the car door. Wife must have caught him cheating or something and left his crap by his car in a wordless way of saying ""Get Out."" Living alone had its drawbacks sure, but knowing that my stuff wasn't going to leave their final resting places until I came around to move them was definitely a bonus. 

My 45 minute drive took only 30, the lack of traffic being a welcome start to what I expected to be a gruelling Monday back in the office. Why drive an hour and a half every day to go to a job I don't like you may ask? Well, as mentioned previously, the whole ""ignoring my issues because they cost too much to fix"" tended to be a driving factor. Approaching the back entrance, I noticed some clothes that look like they were left by a bum or something. We had a homeless issue, especially in the city near the office. They don't usually cause much trouble but it could be annoying when they haphazardly left their stuff in their last sleeping spot after leaving the next morning. Looking closer, they seemed to be a bit nicer than what I was used to seeing left behind in an alley. Eh, I shrugged, if they want to pitch their donations, it isn't my place to judge. I just wish they'd leave their crap somewhere else. Preferably somewhere that wasn't a place of business.

Looking down in front of the door I saw one of our company key cards. I read it to myself, Pat Dorrow, and wasn't surprised. Pat had a tendency to be a bit of a clutz, but I figured I'd be a good Samaritan and give it back to him without causing a scene. As I cracked open the back door to ""Tina's Terrific Taxes and Loans"" I was surprised to see I was the first one in. While I had gotten there 15 minutes earlier than expected, usually Tina herself was there well before anyone else. As I poked my head around a corner to see into her office, I could see a jacket draped over her big boss lady chair, her laptop open on her desk, the screen flashing something red, and a paper coffee cup, the lid stained with her signature coral pink lipstick. Obviously she had been in this morning, or maybe she'd even spent the night. As I peered in and saw the army of empty coffee cups that accompanied the first, I began to assume the latter. She must have stepped away for a minute, but it was odd that her melodic voice couldn't be heard echoing down the hallway or muffled behind the break room door. 

Siezing the opportunity to relax for a few minutes before having to shoo away angry clients, I plopped down at my desk and hooked up my laptop into the dock carefully shoved in the back corner. The click of the plug seemed to echo in my skull, the lack of sound again becoming evident. I stopped for a moment, perfectly still, and listened. Not a single bird could be heard outside. The lights were off so the electric humming of the florescents was also absent. Even the low humming of the boiler, which could only ever be heard on days where we were truly empty, seemed to be dead. It was like someone disconnected the world, all power and life being flipped off. 

I could feel the beating of my heart grow heavier, the intense pumping of blood seeming to pulse against my head and wrists as my thoughts grew more dire. Where is everyone? Were there any other cars on the road this morning? When was the last time I got a push notification on my phone? At the last thought, I looked down. No new notifications, not even the automatic ones. Things were starting to get very uncomfortable. I could feel the stillness of the air around me, the warmth making my button down shirt stick to my skin, and making me itch like crazy.

Crazy. I had to be right? I must have gone crazy or something, that's why there's nothing here. It must be a dream or some psychotic break or something. That's the only thing that makes sense. I pinched my arm, the pain immediate and piercing. Just as quickly as it had happened, it dulled back to the same nothingness that suffocated me. Okay, so maybe not dreaming. But this can't be happening. I looked at the desk behind mine and saw my next plan: a letter opener. This would definitely knock me out of this hallucination or dream or whatever the hell it was. Hesitantly, I held it against the palm of my hand, and pulled down as quickly as I could. The pain, that was definitely real. Blood pooled and dripped against the lacquered wood, the deep red a stark contrast to the pearlescent paint meant to invoke the luxury look of marble. The fresh cut against the still air stung, the wound continuing to blossom new petals of red with every moment. Slamming my palms together in an attempt to slow the bleeding, I rushed to the restroom. 

I sprinted down the hallway to the only restroom in the whole office, leaving a trail of scarlet in my wake. As I approached, I saw the red marker on the handle. Dammit. Locked. I banged on the door, each bang of my fists accented by the sharp pain of the gash on my palm. After what felt like minutes of shouting and cracking knuckles to wood, I quieted back down. The moment I did, not a single sound followed. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and reached into my back pocket. My wallet was thin, but the few credit cards I kept would work on the door whether they were maxed out or not. I slipped it between the door and the frame and heard the click as I slid it down. Swinging the door open, I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see. But it wasn't this. 

A bright blue dress draped over the toilet and a prestine pair of sandals sitting below. I knew that dress. Hell I'd seen 3 times in the past week whenever Tina had an ""important client"" coming in to discuss business. She wouldn't have left it laying like this, not dipping into the pooled water and draping down to the dirty floor. She'd rather die than let anything happen to that dress, and she's said that to me herself on more than one occasion. With only the emergency light on, the shadows cast crept up the walls and towered above me. I tried to knock myself out of my stupor, turning on the sink and rinsing my hand clean of blood. Thankfully we kept the first aid kit in the medicine cabinet right above the sink. Without even looking up, I popped it open and pulled the gauze out to wrap up the self-inflicted wound. A long sigh followed, reverberating off the tile and echoing far more than it had any right to.

Once I was sure the gauze was wrapped tightly, I put everything away and shut the cabinet door. The mirror glinted as it caught the light from up above, glittering red on the barely illuminated wall. As I looked in the mirror for what felt like the first time today, I could see the panic on my face. I looked so small against the backdrop of shadow behind me, looming like a predator about to pounce. I closed my eyes and splashed some water on my face, the cool sensation seeming to snap me back to some level of reality. But as I wiped the water from my eyes, I saw it. When it thought I wasn't looking. I caught it just before it went back to being perfectly still but I know what I saw. My shadow. I saw it blink.

Paris Hilton, CanCan - alright stay with me, old but I wore it in high school and was reminded of it the other day. Not as nostalgic as I hoped but still a harmless fruity floral scent. Fine but forgettable 6.2

Clean Reserve, Skin - I go between loving this and being underwhelmed. It does smell clean and a little lived in? Great office scent, but also doesn’t last. 7.0

Caroline Herrera, Good Girl - I thought I was going to love this, the almond/coffee ness of it, but I catch myself smelling it hours later and get a headache. Weirdly too scented which is funny I keep complaining about nothing lasting. This is too perfumery for me 5.2

Clean, Whipped Cherry - Love!! Wish it lasted more than ten fucking seconds! Clean Reserve I just wanna talk 7.9

Love Don’t Be Shy - Love. Someone was complaining that it smells like fruity pebbles and I couldn’t agree more in a good way. Makes me feel like girly and sweet and I try to channel Ms. Rihanna energy 8.1

Chloe (in 2008) - This was my basic bitch signature scent for years. Tried to smell it the other day and it was completely different? What happened here

Acqua Di Gio, Ocean - I tried to be a clean perfume person and got this and was just underwhelmed. Like fine in theory, clean, water esque, but not something I’m writing home about. 6.6

Light Blue, Dolce & Gabbana - Classic. My mom has worn it my whole life so it’s more her than me but I do like the freshness of this scent and it’s still feminine somehow? 7.3

Sol De Janeiro, 62 - Love this spray. The pistachio just vibes with my skin really well, I always get compliments on it. But it doesn’t last long (okay is this maybe a me problem at this point???) 7.9

Doctor wants to do more tests but it's costly and we don't seem to have any direction/hints, and I don't think we're likely to find any specific cause?

Over the last 12 months I've start gagging a lot, it was originally like once a week but its progressed to on average like 5 times a day. Sometimes 0 times a day. Sometimes 10 times a day. I usually don't vomit, but sometimes I do (like once every 5-10 times). Triggers include:

* Needing to go to the toilet (often). This is the most common trigger. 1 or 2. I start gagging before I realise I need to go. Once I go, the gagging usually resolves until the next time I need the bathroom.
* Iced coffee (50% of the time)- happens after my morning iced coffee, but not every time. It has also happened soon after drinking a vitamin drink- so it doesn't appear to be specific to iced coffee.
* Certain smells (uncommon) - my gag reflex has been more sensitive to certain smells. It has on occasion happened when cooking dinner
* Temperature changes (uncommon)- e.g. walking from a hot space into a cold space or vice versa.
* Randomly- Sometimes I can't see any related trigger or pattern.

Doctor is clueless and throwing tests and ideas at me with no clear direction. I have had a blood test and ultrasound. I am waiting on my appointment to discuss results, but the ultrasound tech hinted that she didnt find anything, and my doctor said she would call if the blood test found anything (and she hasn't called, and its been over a week since my test). She did prescribe omezprazole to see if it was like an acid reflux thing- I took the tablet once and then gagged like 20 times that day. So it seems like it made it worse? Is that a sign that it is related to reflux somehow? 

History: No other symptoms appear related. I am on a few psychotropic medications and birth control but havent had any medication changes in the last 12 months. I have sleep apnea (I use CPAP) and I am often very tired. ",1,1739147780.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

# Understanding Intense Sadness

# The Depth of Sadness

Sadness is often the most immediate and profound emotion experienced in grief. This feeling can manifest as a heavy weight on the heart, making even the simplest tasks feel monumental. Intense sadness arises from the realization of loss, the love that remains for the departed, and the void they leave behind. It can feel like a dark cloud that looms over every aspect of your life, influencing your thoughts, behaviors, and interactions with others.

# Coping Strategies

1.     **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: Denying sadness only prolongs the healing process. Allow yourself to feel and express your grief.

# Facing Anger Head-On

# The Nature of Anger

Anger often accompanies grief, manifesting as frustration, resentment, or even rage. This emotion can stem from feeling abandoned, questioning the fairness of the situation, or even anger towards the deceased for leaving. Anger can also be directed inward, leading to feelings of guilt and self-blame.

# Coping Strategies

1.     **Recognize Your Anger**: Understand that feeling angry is a natural part of grief. Acknowledge it without judgment.

o   *Quote*: ""Anger is a valid response to loss."" — Dr. Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, psychiatrist. [Understanding Grief](https://www.kublerross.com)

2.     **Channel Your Anger**: Physical activity can be a constructive way to release pent-up anger. Consider running, boxing, or even gardening.

o   *Quote*: ""Movement can help release emotional energy."" — Dr. Brene Brown, researcher. [Physical Activity and Grief](https://www.brenebrown.com)

3.     **Express Yourself**: Talk about your anger with trusted friends or family. Verbalizing your feelings can provide relief.

o   *Quote*: ""Talking about your feelings can lessen their intensity."" — Dr. John K. Pollard, grief expert. \[

o   *Quote*: ""Protecting your peace is essential during grief."" — Dr. Marcia Reynolds, psychologist. [Setting Boundaries](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201803/how-set-boundaries-when-youre-grieving)

**5. Seek Professional Help**: If anger becomes overwhelming, consider speaking with a therapist who specializes in grief.

o   *Quote*: ""Therapy can provide a safe space to work through complex emotions."" — Dr. Alan Wolfelt. [Finding a Grief Counselor](https://www.grief.com/find-a-grief-counselor)

# Overcoming Anxiety

# Understanding Anxiety in Grief

Anxiety can creep in during grief, manifesting as worry about the future, feelings of panic, or overwhelming dread. It often arises from uncertainty—about life without your loved one, about your emotional well-being, or even about daily responsibilities. The unpredictability of grief can make these feelings even more intense.

# Coping Strategies

1.     **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Practice breathing techniques to calm your mind and body. Focus on inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly. This can help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart or shortness of breath.

o   *Quote*: ""Breath is the bridge between the body and the mind."" — Thich Nhat Hanh, mindfulness teacher. [Breathing Techniques](https://www.mindful.org/deep-breathing-exercises/)

2.     **Establish a Routine**: Creating a daily schedule can provide structure and predictability, which can help alleviate anxiety. Even small routines like morning coffee or evening walks can provide comfort.

o   *Quote*: ""Routine can be a powerful ally in navigating grief."" — Dr. Alan Wolfelt. [Importance of Routine](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-routine-in-grief-2795759)

3.     **Limit Information Overload**: In times of grief, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by advice or information. Choose one or two trusted sources to guide you and allow yourself breaks from external noise.

o   *Quote*: ""Sometimes, less is more when it comes to information."" — Dr. Susan David. [Managing Information Overload](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-well-being/201812/too-much-information)

4.     **Grounding Techniques**: Use grounding techniques to bring your focus back to the present moment. This could include noticing your surroundings, feeling the ground beneath your feet, or holding onto a comforting object.

o   *Quote*: ""Grounding techniques can help anchor you when anxiety feels overwhelming."" — Dr. Brene Brown. [Grounding Exercises](https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/grounding-techniques)

5.     **Consider Professional Support**: If anxiety persists, seeking help from a mental health professional can provide tailored coping strategies and a safe space to explore your feelings.

o   *Quote*: ""Therapy can illuminate paths to healing that you may not see on your own."" — Dr. Judith Orloff. [Finding Therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)

# Confronting Guilt

# The Nature of Guilt

Guilt is another common emotion experienced during grief. It often arises from feelings of regret—wishing you had done more for your loved one or feeling guilty about moving on or feeling joy after their passing. This emotion can be particularly heavy and can prevent you from healing.

# Coping Strategies

1.     **Acknowledge Your Guilt**: Recognize that feeling guilty is a normal part of grief. Accepting these feelings can be the first step towards letting them go.

o   *Quote*: ""Guilt is a complex emotion, and understanding it is key to healing."" — Dr. Alan Wolfelt. [Understanding Grief and Guilt](https://www.grief.com/guilt-in-grief)

2.     **Reframe Your Thoughts**: Challenge negative self-talk and reframe your thoughts. For instance, instead of thinking, ""I should have done more,"" consider, ""I did the best I could with the knowledge I had.""

o   *Quote*: ""Reframing can open new avenues of understanding."" — Dr. Susan David. \[Cognitive Reframing\](https

 3 **Write a Letter**: Consider writing a letter to your loved one, expressing your feelings of guilt and your wishes for them. This can facilitate a sense of closure.

o   *Quote*: ""Writing a letter can be a cathartic experience."" — Dr. James Pennebaker. [The Power of Letter Writing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-raise-happy-kids/201707/the-power-writing-letters)

4.     **Forgive Yourself**: Understand that no one is perfect, and everyone has regrets. Practicing self-forgiveness is essential for your healing.

o   *Quote*: ""Forgiveness is not just for the other; it’s a gift to yourself."" — Dr. John K. Pollard. [Forgiveness and Healing](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-forgiveness-in-grief-2795749)

5.     **Seek Professional Help**: If guilt becomes overwhelming, consider speaking with a therapist who can help you work through these feelings in a constructive way.

o   *Quote*: ""Therapy offers a safe space to explore the layers of guilt."" — Dr. Judith Orloff. [Finding a Therapist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)

# Addressing Isolation

# Understanding Isolation

Isolation can be a significant concern during the grieving process. It’s common to withdraw from friends and family, either due to feeling misunderstood or simply not wanting to engage. However, this isolation can exacerbate feelings of sadness and anxiety.

# Coping Strategies

1.     **Reach Out**: Make an effort to connect with friends or family members, even if it feels challenging. A simple text or call can open the door to support.

o   *Quote*: ""Reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness."" — Dr. Alan Wolfelt. [Building Support Networks](https://www.grief.com/how-to-reach-out-for-support)

2.     **Join a Support Group**: Connecting with others who are also grieving can provide a sense of community and understanding. Sharing experiences can be incredibly healing.

o   *Quote*: ""Support groups can provide validation and connection."" — Dr. Judith Orloff. [Finding a Grief Support Group](https://www.griefshare.org)

3.     **Plan Social Activities**: Even if you don’t feel like it, planning social outings can help combat isolation. Start small with low-pressure events, such as a coffee date or a walk in the park.

o   *Quote*: ""Engaging with others can bring warmth back into your life."" — Dr. Brene Brown. [Social Engagement and Grief](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-importance-of-social-connection-in-grieving_n_5f9e0b7ec5b6e4b4c1f4e0c8)

4.     **Volunteer**: Helping others can shift your focus away from your pain and foster a sense of purpose. Consider volunteering at a local charity or community center.

o   *Quote*: ""Service to others can be a profound source of healing."" — Dr. Alan Wolfelt. [Volunteering in Grief](https://www.grief.com/volunteering-as-a-form-of-healing)

5.     **Utilize Online Communities**: If in-person socializing feels too daunting, consider joining online grief support groups. These safe spaces can provide connection without the pressure of face-to-face interaction.

o   *Quote*: ""Online communities can bridge the gap when physical presence isn’t possible."" — Dr. Judith Orloff. [Online Grief Support](https://www.grief.com/online-support-groups)

As you move through your grief, you may find opportunities to honor your loved one’s memory. Consider creating a tribute, engaging in activities they loved, or starting a project that reflects their passions. Finding ways to celebrate their life can provide comfort and a

**A Prayer for Those in Grief**

Holy and Loving Presence,  
In this time of deep sorrow and loss,  
We seek comfort and solace in Your embrace.  
Help those who are grieving to feel Your gentle presence,  
Surrounding them with peace and understanding.

As they navigate the waves of sadness,

and guide them in expressing their feelings in healthy ways.

In times of anxiety, remind them to breathe,  
To find stillness and strength in the present moment.  
Help them release the burden of guilt,  
And show them the path to self-forgiveness.

When isolation feels heavy,  
Encourage them to reach out,  
To connect with others who can share in their journey.  
May they find community and support,  
And know they are not alone.

As they honor the memory of their loved ones,  
Let love fill the spaces where grief resides.  
Transform their pain into a testimony of love,  
And grant them the hope of healing in time.

With every tear shed, may they feel Your compassion,  
With every breath, may they sense Your love.  
Guide them gently through this journey of grief,  
And lead them toward the light of peace.

In the name of Jesus, the divine healer. Amen.

So I was going to to wait it out until I got the Scent Lab collection, but that's taking a bit longer than expected.  So without dragging it out longer, I decided to just to this first bit of it!  But DAMN, Spring 1 be kickin' off 2025 with a BANG!  Probably the most I've seen released in one go!  Though it was spread by at least 3 weeks (and some previews in there as well).  So, let's just dive right into the review!



* **Vanilla Suede** (Cozy Vanilla, Blushed Suede, Crisp Linen) - As the first new scent of the year, Vanilla Suede has a really interesting soapy quality to it at initial spray.  It's definitely got a light vanilla scent to it, but I feel like the clean notes and the suede makes the scent smell definitely like Dove soap.  It's fine, but it's definitely a scent I wasn't expecting.  
* **Sunwashed Santal** (Italian Bergamot, White Violet, Amber Wood) - So if you thought Lost in Santal was a bit too much of a scent, Sunwashed Santal might be a better purchase as it smells a bit brighter (thanks to the bergamot).  It still is a pretty woody scent overall.  This was a much better scent than Lost in Santal overall for me and kind of sticks out in the amount.
* **Amber Blush** (Warm Amber, Fresh Jasmine, Oak Moss) - As the only returning scent of this collection, it's been quite a while since we've seen Amber Blush, but I'm not sure I'd be very much into this one as it reminds me of like Midnight Spell & Indigo Dreams as it smells REALLY light, but I definitely get the amber and jasmine, but it just doesn't seem to a scent I gravitate towards.
* **4ever Sweet** (Candied Grape, Sweet Berry, Powdered Sugar) - As the main scent for Spring 1 (although it's sold out already), 4ever Sweet was the lone scent in collaboration with the Valentine's candy, Sweethearts!  Little surprised it was just this scent because the candy comes in different flavors as is.  So onto the scent, this is B&BW's first grape scent and it's fine, I guess?  It's pretty sweet and light like candy, but the grape is kind of medicinal on me (expected with grapes, I feel like more than cherry).  At first I was hoping it was more like Sugar Coated (Pink Fairy Gumdrop), but definitely isn't.  It's OK, but could've been better
* **Midnight Addiction** (Ripe Plum, Rich Almond Flower, Addictive Coffee Bean) - Onto Wave 2 of Everyday Luxuries, we start off with this one which is a surprisingly easy love from me.  It's a really dark and sultry kind of scent and has kind of a deep tone to it.  I do get the sweetness of the plum and almond flower, but I actually don't get much of the coffee bean really.  Maybe on the drydown, but it's very light and kind of makes the scent more complex overall.  It's nice though and I'll definitely be putting it somewhere high on my favorites.
* **Madame Mystique** (Bright Red Berries, Rose Petals, Sultry Woods) - Next scent in, Madame Mystique is a pretty good scent too, actually kind of reminding me a LOT of Dark Kiss or Black Amethyst.  I get the sweetness and fizzy vibe from Dark Kiss shared here, but this scent unfolds more due to the berries and rose, especially the latter.  So it's related just not too terribly so.  I kind of like it but since it does remind me of some other scents, it's not on the higher levels for me.
* **You're Cheeky** (Pink Peppercorn, Warm Almond Flower, Vanilla Bean) - Another one that kind of reminds me of some other scents, but this one is kind of it's one thing too.  It's got bite from the peppercorn, but what gets me is this syrupy sweet scent that smells like cherry (might be from the almond flower).  It's kind of juicy, but smells a bit fruity and floral and I kind of enjoyed this as well.
* **Seeing Rouge** (Blackcurrant Buds, Sweet Saffron, Amber Moss) - So the only scent I actually do know the scent profile of what its based off of is this one duping Baccarat Rough 540 and it's a scent that I'm not 100% on board with as I tend to get this strange animal clinic smell of it which might be due to the saffron.  Though what's worse is that it's slow to acting and I just can't really get into this one.  Yeah, this is my only pass here.
* **Loyal to You** (Sweet Lemon Blossom, Orange Flower, Vanilla Marshmallow) - Just by scent notes, this one was the one I was excited for!  To me this is the closest to a gourmand scent from this bunch (based from D&G's Devotion).  It also for me initially felt like it could've been similar to Iced Lemon Pound Cake, it's a smidge different.  The lemon is brighter (like in Lemon Drop Martini) but then has this strange otherside in the drydown that eerily reminds me of Belize Tropical Cabana).   I think I like it but, it's so light on me that it fades fast leaving me with little of the lemon.
* **Guilty as Fig** (Fig Nectar, Lush Jasmine, Creamy Musk) - So the only other fig scent B&BW has is literally Brown Sugar & Fig, this is lacking the former punch so we have this super light and sweet scent here.  I do like the scent and though it's a scent that really doesn't quite push boundaries for me, it's a safe scent and just smells good, but LIGHT.  
* **Aqua Hour** (Watery Bergamot, Fresh Peony, Salty Cedarwood) - The last scent, I had to stop a second because we had On the Horizon last year which was an aquatic scent and I had to wonder what they could do to make it different (or which scent it was duping).  This one has a bit of a citrus element to it on top of a salty element with the woody element right behind it.  It's not bad, but not quite one I would hover towards either.

============================

Fav to Least Fav

* Midnight Addiction
* Loyal to Me
* Sunwashed Santal
* You're Cheeky
* Guilty as Fig
* Madame Mystique
* 4ever Sweet
* Vanilla Suede
* Aqua Hour
* Seeing Rouge
* Amber Blush

=============================

So let's talk about Spring 1 altogether

So the only set that I didn't review here was actually the ""Valentine's"" set which included Strawberry Pound Cake (once again releasing in multiple different packagings) and Sweetheart Cherry.  Kind of odd that it's just repeating last year (only time will tell if Iced Lemon Pound Cake eventually joins in).  It's fine, the least exciting release.

Then we have the trio of Vanilla Suede, Sunwashed Santal, and Amber Blush which was kind of expected as clean scents usually release in the Spring season.  HOWEVER, what I didn't expect was that the scents were released under White Barn which I THINK...is a first?  I'm curious to what it all that means since Amber Blush was a stand-alone scent when it first released under B&BW.  So are we to expect more White Barn releases?  Like based from the candles?

Next was the singular release of 4ever Sweet which as I've said, I feel like this collaboration could've expanded on the ideas of other flavors of the candy outside the grape one.  Though a brand new scent is always a win and shame it sold out pretty quick.  

Then we have the Wave 2 of Everyday Luxuries and I'd argue to say that this batch of 7 was a LOT better than the original 10 from last year.  The only scents that I was just not here for was Seeing Rouge and Aqua Hour just because I already knew what I was getting into with the former and the latter just didn't hit for me.  Also, Viva Vanilla and Covered in Roses returned with the updated packaging and lastly Pink Obsessed as well, but only as a mini-spray in a gift-set.  ALSO, this release topped the original because these 9 scents came in OTHER body care...how wild!  

Lastly, we did see Fresh Cut Lilacs (in last year's packaging) and Moonlight Path (in new packaging) came out also.  

Then there's also the case of the BIG DROP of 13 mini-FFMs for this Scent Lab collection.  It's curious as they're kind of promoted as a set to use for layering (though initially thought it was one-note scents, it's got the typical 3-scents).  Big list of scents and eventually they'll be reviewed for Part 2 (or might be added to Spring 2's review perhaps).",1,1739147311.0,bathandbodyworks,0,0.67,False
1iltl38,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iltl38/save_yourself_dont_do_the_right_thing/,"Save Yourself, Don't Do the Right Thing","The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades.

Retched woman. I found her sprawled out on the floor with her curled gray and white hair, and wrinkled, shriveled-up body covered in liver spots. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit her throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids won’t be too happy about this, but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

Two weeks ago I was on the verge of going completely broke. This was nothing new though. Finances and I have never had a good relationship. I know I had a problem, at least half of me acknowledged it. The other half kept spinning that roulette wheel and betting on that one horse to beat the odds. I was always close, but not close enough. I was counting down the dollars at the grocery store, but being careful as to not forget the tax. I refused to be that person who would have to put some food back while checking out. “I think I got this one” I told myself. $45 with some wiggle room. That’ll last me… maybe five days? If I’m lucky?

I was walking through the bread aisle when an old woman with a back hump was pushing a shopping cart in the other direction. As we passed each other, I noticed not only the waft of cigarette smell, but something had fallen to the ground in my peripheral view. I looked down and saw that the old lady had dropped some money. As I went to pick it up, I saw it was two, crumbled-up $100 bills. I felt in my chest what I can only describe as getting giddy like a child. I had the immediate instinct to shove it into my jacket pocket and walk away. But, I didn’t. Caution override the desire of thievery. 

It’s $200. I’m sure she would report the money missing to the grocery store just to be safe, and they would catch me on camera taking it. There was one of those black orb-looking cameras on the ceiling in the aisle right next to me where the blacked-out cover of it was to prevent people from knowing where the camera was looking. Also, the bills were in rough condition. What if she just managed to save enough money for a full grocery shopping trip for once? She very well could be broke like me. For some reason, this oldie hit a soft spot in me.

“Excuse me ma’am, I think you dropped this.” She turned to me to see if I was talking to her or someone else. She had bright turquoise eyes. I’ve never seen eyes that color before. They were very pretty, but they sent a shiver down my spine because of how odd they were. I noticed I had paused too long looking at her eyes.

“....Sorry, I think you dropped some money.” I handed her the $200.

She was shocked. “Oh, thank you very much. How did I manage to do that? Thank you.” I nodded, and as I began to walk away, she continued.

“Wait, I have something for you.” She reached into a small purse, and with the crumbled bills I handed back to her, she handed me two more crisp $100 bills. $400 total. I assumed she was not aware of what she was doing.

“Ma’am, no need.” I put my hand out to gently push her hand back.

“I’m aware,” she said.

“And now it’s yours.” She re-extended her hand, now eagerly getting me to take the money. 

I replied, “That’s very kind of you, but there’s no way I could take this. That’s a lot of money.”

She replied, “You could have walked away with what you found. But you didn’t. Now, you have double.” There was a brief pause while I contemplated taking the money or not.

“If I needed it I wouldn’t be giving it to you” she said. I took the money from her.

“Thank you,” I replied.

“You don’t know how much this means to me.”

She looked at my shopping cart which so far only had a loaf of bread and a can of baked beans. “It looks like you have some shopping to do” she said with a smile before turning around and pushing her cart away.

If you know the mind of an addict, I’m sure this comes as no surprise. I spent $150 on groceries and the rest I immediately went to the casino that is conveniently seven minutes away from my apartment. The next horse race was the next day, but I couldn’t wait. I knew I was going to make it big this time. Screw the tables, I didn’t want to waste my money having to tip the croupier. I went first to the slot machines. I was going to spend maybe $20, $50 at most if I didn’t win, which I thought at least I’d make a little. But only half an hour later I realized I spent $200. I got caught up in it. I needed to get my head in the game. 

I went up to the “self-serve” roulette table. A chair was open. Six other people sat around the wheel staring as it went round and round. Everybody anticipating that big break. That spin concluded. Some people groaned, some said nothing. I looked at my digital screen. Normally with roulette I like to spread my chances out; pick multiple numbers, overlap, etc. But something was telling me to put my whole $50 left on number seven. The guy sitting next to me saw my bet and scoffed.

“I’ve been losing money here for an hour. You’re not going to win that bet” he said. He noticed the others at the table were looking at us. He grinned.

“If it lands on seven, I’ll give you an extra $50. If you lose, you owe me $50” he said. There was a short pause. 

“Same here. No way you’re winning that” a woman sitting across the table said.

“I will too” the man sitting next to her said. All six people were putting in $50 each. An extra $300 on top of my incoming winnings. I couldn’t resist.

“Alright” I said confidently. My heart sank. My face went flush. What have I done? The roulette ivorine was released, and round it went. I glanced back and forth between the wheel and the others. They were glancing back and forth between the wheel and me. It landed. Eight. It landed on eight. They cheered. Fight or flight kicked in. I reached into my jacket pocket. I decided I was going to pretend to get the money out of my wallet and then book it out of the casino. 

When I opened my wallet, expecting nothing, were multiple crisp $50 bills. Seven of them. I tried to hide my shock and play it cool. I started to hand out the $50 bills to each of them. I sat back down. I was left again with $50. I… did seven. I put it all on seven again. I don’t know why, but I did. Everyone at the table laughed at me. Pity laughed. 

“You must really have an issue” one of the guys said. The wheel spun. Everyone at the table was grinning, watching the wheel, waiting to make fun of me again. It landed. It was seven. The $50 that appeared in my wallet turned into $250. I made my money back. Everyone looked at me in utter disbelief. Again, I don’t know what took over me, but I put the whole $250 on eight. Now everyone was getting really irritated.

“Are you kidding me?” one guy said.

“This is ridiculous” another woman said.

The wheel spun. There was an anticipation at that table I had never experienced before. It landed. It was eight. I had won another $250. I had never won a single dollar gambling before. Not a penny. Everyone got pissed; in general, at the circumstance. Not at me. Thank god. Three people at the table got up and walked away angry. The force that had overcome me “told” me to leave the table. So, I did. I walked out of the casino. Normally I would keep going, but something was telling me to stop. Something.

I entered my little apartment and tossed my keys onto the kitchen table. Very cliche for a person struggling with money, I looked at the two overdue credit card bills and electric bill notice also sitting on the table. I sat down. What just happened? Finally winning with anything involving gambling didn’t feel as good as I thought it would. Facing again the fact that I am an addict, how was I even able to walk away from the table without spending all my winnings away?

I honestly became alarmed when I felt the urge to deposit my winnings at the bank tomorrow to start paying off my debts. Responsibility was a new desire for me. I got up and grabbed my jacket and keys. I felt antsy all of a sudden. I decided to go grab a coffee at the coffee shop across the street. 

I got my iced Americano and decided to stand outside the coffee shop to feel the breeze. After a couple of minutes, an older woman with a cane started to walk up the sidewalk. It was weird. I hadn’t seen her cross the street or walk up from down the way. I realized after a moment that it was the same woman from the grocery store.

“Oh hello there. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?” The woman said this to me as though we had known each other for years. Her smile was kind, but her turquoise eyes showed no emotion.

“…Good, just grabbing some coffee. How ‘bout you?” I said.

“Me too. An iced Americano always makes my day” she said. She stopped in front of me and continued.

“How has the rest of your day been?” referencing since we met at the grocery store.

“Good. Thanks again” I replied. The woman grinned.

“Be careful now. Nothing stays for long. The good and the bad come and go” she said. I assumed she was making a corny old-person comment to spend the money she gave me wisely. I pretended her comment wasn’t annoying and arrogant, like how people want the barista to see and thank them for putting money in the tip jar. I gave her a “warm” smile.
She walked around me. I heard the little metal bells the coffee shop put on top of the door jingle as she walked in. I turned around curious to see the reaction of the employees to her, if she was a regular or not so I would know if I would see her again. But, she wasn’t there. The coffee shop wasn’t big. You can see the whole front of the coffee shop through the window and the door. She was nowhere to be found. There’s no possible way she could have gone anywhere else in the second she went around me to enter the coffee shop. She was gone.

Oddly enough, I felt pretty calm. I could tell this reaction was definitely from this new force or state I’ve been in since the casino earlier. It was bizarre, but I didn’t feel the need to question what I just witnessed. At least not right then. I sipped my last bit of coffee and crossed the street back to my apartment. Again, I hung up my jacket and put my keys on the table. It was only 3:00pm, but I suddenly became so drained. Just utterly tired. I showered and went to bed.

I woke up at 7:00am. I felt refreshed. I got up and had my cup of coffee while watching birds and passerbyers outside my living room window. I had some cereal, showered, and headed out to the bank to deposit my winnings from the day before. Waiting in line at the bank, I felt a wave of nervousness come over me. I didn’t know what was happening. I kept going back and forth between feeling really good and pure dread. 

When it was my turn, I handed the teller my deposit slip and took my wallet out to hand her the money. What I found was not only the winnings, but an extra $50. I paused for a moment. Am I becoming extremely forgetful? The teller waited.

“Sir, are you making a deposit?” she said.

“Yes. Sorry. Here” I replied. I handed her the amount I won. I kept the new $50 bill. I left the bank. Off to the race track I went.

It wasn’t busy. Only a quarter of the people that normally fill the betting room were there. I looked at the horses racing that day. I never understood why they gave the horses weird names that sound like a child from the 1940’s make them up. “Flash Trixie?” “Corn-of-Copia?” What even is that? The force from yesterday washed over me again. My focus went toward horse #7. I didn’t bother to catch its name. The odds were in the middle. The horse had a pretty average record. Not great, but not bad. I went to the counter.

I kept it short. “On #7. First place” I said and slid my cash over to the betting teller. Dead-eyed, he took my money. As the cash left my hand, I saw what I handed over. Five $100 bills. I thought I just deposited $500 at the bank? I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At that brief moment, I was unable to talk or move. He handed me a ticket and I just walked away. I went outside and stood there, watching the track as the horses lined up ready to go. An overly confident man stood near me. He turned when he saw me walk up to watch.

“Which ones you got?” he said, meaning what was my bet.

“#7” I said.

“What place?” he asked.

“First” I replied. He scoffed.

“I mean, I guess you could have chosen worse. Good luck” he said. I ignored him.

The bell rang and the horses were off. Only a couple of the jockeys kept back to conserve energy. Most of the horses started at full force. I could feel the ground vibrate from the stands from the galloping. Though the speed was incredible, there wasn’t much movement. All the horses kept their places where they started. Then, #8, something along the lines of “Blitz of Coffee” charged forward to the head of the pack, maintaining first place. #7 remained toward the back, maybe third from last.

“Oh geez. You’re not doing too good buddy” the guy said to me. I ignored him again. The race was maybe half done. Then, #7 got some wind in its sails. It pushed forward. Third from last, fifteenth, twelve, eighth, then third place.

“I put #8 on first” the man said.

“It looks like it’s gonna take it home”

Inch by inch, the horses about 80% done, #7 got into second place. My heart began to pound. They were in the final stretch. They were going and going. #7 kept pushing. And then… they were done. #8 crossed the finish line in first place. #7 placed second maybe one hoof away from #8. The man next to me cheered and waved his ticket in the air.

“Yes. Yes. That’s how you do it.”

He turned to me. “Maybe next time bud.” He went inside to collect his winnings. As he was entering the door to the betting room, two tall, broad muscular men and a short man in a suit walked out, coming toward me. When they got to me, the short man looked at me as though he was waiting for me to do something.

“...Hi?” I said to him.

“Well?” the short man said. There was a pause.

“Pay up” the man said, irritated.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about” I replied. The man scoffed and looked down, pinching the bridge of his nose, becoming more irritated.

“Pay up. You lost. That was the deal. You owe two-grand” he said. I was shocked.

“What?” I said.

“What are you talking about? I bet $50… or $500. No strings attached.” The man clearly had enough of me.

“Alright, let’s go. Inside.” As the man said that, the two bigger men started to walk toward me. I didn’t know what was going on. I bolted. I didn’t even look behind me to see if they were running after me or not. I just kept running. I got in my car and sped home.

I rushed into my apartment and locked the regular lock and the two deadbolts on my door. I just stood there for a minute, processing everything. I thought I must be mentally deteriorating. I’m imagining money switching amounts within the blink of an eye. I wasn’t remembering doing certain transactions or bets. I needed to see a doctor immediately, but this is the U.S. healthcare system. I didn’t know if I had the money to do so. I didn’t need any more debt.

I went online and paid my electric bill just to give me some sort of comfort in the moment. I checked my bank account, it showed that I did in fact deposit the money I knew I deposited, so that was good at least. I then sat at my kitchen table for about two hours going back and forth between fiddling around with apps on my phone and watching the door. I wanted to make sure the guys at the racing track didn’t know where I lived. I think my brain was trying to protect me from the trauma of all of this by having me suddenly become exhausted from the anxiety, and shut down. I quickly fell asleep.

The nightmare I had was surreal to say the least. I was in a pitch-black room. Or black space. It didn’t feel exactly like a room. I was able to stand on a solid floor or ground, but it still felt like endless darkness. No actual floor, walls, or ceiling. About twenty feet in front of me stood the old woman who had given me the money, who I had seen three times now, including this nightmare. She just stared at me. She stared at me with those bizarre turquoise eyes. It felt like an eternity but it must have been only five seconds.
She extended her cupped hand to reveal a small, black kitten. It must have been only a few days old. It was squealing like newborn kittens do, wanting its mother or to be fed. I hesitated for a moment, but the squealing wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know why the old woman wasn’t doing anything about it. She just held the kitten forward, wanting me to take it. A nurturing part of myself took over, so I extended my cupped hand. Without either the old woman or I moving from our places, the black kitten appeared in my hand.

Still squealing, I held it close. “Shhhh, it’s okay” I said to it. I held it close to my chest and began to gently pet it with my other hand. The kitten gradually became quiet and started purring. I looked back up at the old woman. She was still just staring at me.

After a moment, the kitten went silent. It must have fallen asleep. Then, it happened. The fire. My hands began to burn. The kitten had self-combusted. It started screaming a vocalization of pain I had never heard before. A scream I couldn’t recognize as a human or non-human animal. It was warped. It sounded like more than one living thing screaming in utter pain. I dropped the kitten and it hit the floor. I felt horrible for dropping it, but my hands were literally burning from it. It continued to scream. I looked up again at the old woman, she was now smiling. Grinning.

The kitten became silent once again, and the fire burned out. Its charred body sat there lifeless, smoldering. Once again, I looked up, and the old woman’s face now appeared maybe an inch in front of mine. This woke me. I jolted up in my bed in a sweat. The nightmare had felt so real. So unnerving. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I took a moment to gather myself before getting out of bed with some deep breathing. I showered and then made some coffee. I sat at my kitchen table still collecting myself. I decided I needed to get out and move around. Maybe get some more coffee across the street to get my dopamine levels high. I walked over to my window to see if the coffee shop was busy or not. I froze. In front of the coffee shop, a man was talking with the same old woman. The feeling that had overtaken me previously before was now panic. The old woman reached into her purse and began to hand the man money. I needed to intervene.

I opened the window and began to yell. “Hey. Hey man. Don’t do it. Don’t talk with her. She’s not ok. She’s trying to trick you. Walk away.” The man looked up at me alarmed and confused. The old woman looked up at me with a subtle yet intense anger.

I continued. “It’s not safe. Don’t do it. Go away. Now.”

The man looked away from me and started to walk backward for a moment, looking at the old woman just as startled as he was looking at me. Then he turned around and speed-walked away. The old woman now turned fully facing my direction, holding the same, angry look. She just stood there, staring at me. I quickly closed the window. As I looked back down in front of the coffee shop, the old woman had disappeared. As I turned around, I saw something on the kitchen table where I had been sitting. I walked over to the table. It was a wrinkled $1 bill with multiple brown, splotchy stains all over it.

I’m not religious. I’m not spiritual. I don’t know if I would consider myself agnostic, or even atheist. I do however believe, as many would agree, that there are some things that simply can’t be explained by (though legitimate) scientific processes. It was clear that something was deeply wrong here. I could continue to let things spiral, or I can try and stop this now while I have control over my own life. Control over the parts of my life I haven’t given up on my own.

I’m not going to accept it, and she’s not here with me at least visibly to hand it back to her. So, I decided to burn it. The easiest way to destroy it. I grabbed a lighter out of a drawer in the kitchen, lit the dollar bill on fire, and tossed it into the metal basin of my kitchen sink. It burned, and then, nothing. Nothing in particular happened besides the dollar turning to ash. I looked around my apartment. Nothing. I saw nothing change, and I felt nothing change. I washed the ashes down the drain.

Three knocks were made on my door. I grabbed a kitchen knife nearest to me. I looked through the peephole, no one was standing there. Were they waiting for me around the corner? I decided the best bet was, even if it left me vulnerable, to open my door wide, wait a moment to see if anyone lunges expecting me to walk out, and then run out with my knife. One, two, three. I opened the door. Nothing. I rushed out with the knife and frantically looked back and forth toward both sides of the hallway. No one.

I looked down and saw a square envelope on the ground. I bent down and picked up the envelope. The front was blank. I went back into my apartment and quickly locked the door. I opened the envelope and pulled out what seemed to be a page torn out of a small notebook. It read:

“She got me too - 137 [redacted] St.”

Truly, reading that, I felt less alone. Though the overall situation was still fucked, if this person was being honest, they were also going through something the old woman had done to them. If it was a trap, then I shouldn’t go to the address at all, right? Especially not right now, when they are expecting me. However, I knew I couldn’t wait for things to get worse. My reality was being distorted. I needed to act while I could. I grabbed my keys, put my jacket on, and put the knife in the inner pocket. I would go to the address now.

I pulled up to the address parking across the street. It was a fairly plain one-floor home. Light beige-painted brick with some grey siding. White garage doors. Some bushes near the front windows seemed only partially trimmed. One cheap rainbow was in the dirt where the bushes were planted, blowing in the breeze. I walked up the short, worn asphalt driveway to the front door. Before knocking, I tried to see into the windows from where I was standing, but it was too dark inside. I knocked, three times. No one answered. I knocked again. No one answered. I stood there for a moment, thinking what to do next. I put my ear up to the door to see if I could hear anyone inside, doing anything at all. It was silent. I tried the doorknob. As though it was well-oiled, the turn of the knob made its clicking sound and the door slid slightly open. It was as though the door was telling me “Please, come in.”

I carefully took a few steps inside. “Hello?” I called out. No one responded. There was a hallway in front of me lined with family photos on each side. From where I stood I couldn’t make out the faces in the pictures. The hallway led to what I partially could see as a vinyl-floored kitchen with old wooden cabinets. To my left was a hallway with dark green carpeting that I’m assuming led to bedrooms. To my right was an entranceway to a room that bent around the left corner. I would try there first.

I slowly walked in. When I could fully see the room, I stopped and took it in. The room smelled of cigarettes. To my right, there was an old behemoth of a TV maybe from the 1990’s that was turned off, sitting on a TV stand that had a doily tablecloth draped over it. To my left was an armchair with a TV stand next to it with a remote sitting on top. I couldn’t make out the armchair color. Dark olive green? Off-brown? Laying on the ground in front of the armchair, sprawled out, was the old lady.

The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. Where the blood didn’t create a shade of crimson, the carpet matched the light beige of the outside of the house. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit the old woman’s throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids, and others I assume were in the photos in the entrance hallway, won’t be too happy about this; but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

I heard something, what sounded like a wooden door from the direction of the bedrooms hallway closed. I began to hear light footsteps on the carpet. I bolted out of there, out the front door which I left open, to my car, and sped down the road not looking back.

Two weeks had gone by. I read online from a local news outlet that the police found the scene at the old woman’s house and that the investigation is ongoing. In any other circumstance, I would have reported it to the authorities, especially as I didn’t want to be framed for something I didn’t do. But, this was not a murder. This was someone who put an end to a malevolent force. How would I be able to explain any part of what I went through to the police anyway? I would not only be charged with murder but most likely thrown in a psychiatric ward for an even longer time than I would have serving time in a regular prison. I thought if the police were to arrest me, so be it. Till then, I was a free man. Free of what the old woman was doing and was planning to do to me. Going forward, I told myself I would not do the right thing. I would not return dropped money. I would not take it either. Dropped money, helping an elderly person cross the street, it’s simply not happening. I’m not going to be the good guy or the bad guy.

I started going to recovery meetings to address my gambling addiction, and I already noticed my life starting to improve. For once in my life I started to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I even applied for a job that not only paid more but aligned with my passions and interests. I got an offer and I let them know I could start the following week. 

I woke up on a Sunday feeling refreshed. I got up and made some coffee and sat near the window to watch people pass by. The wind was making the trees sway, and the leaves rushed down the sidewalk. The coffee shop across the street was moderately busy with people lining up inside to escape the cold and warm their hands with a mug of the shop’s fresh brew. I finished my cup of coffee and went over to put it in the sink. When I placed my cup in, I saw something crumbled up sitting in the drain. I used my index and middle fingers and successfully pulled it out. Once it was in my hand, I unfolded what appeared to be a piece of paper, which I then discovered to be a $1 bill.",1,1739147301.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I delivered some documents to an accounting firm and while I was waiting for a staff member to pick up the documents, the receptionist and I made small talk. We studied the same degree and work in the same field, so we spoke about our post uni experiences. The receptionist asked me if I had a side hustle. I said no but I'm potentially looking for a second job since I have debt to pay off. She mentioned she had a few side businesses and asked me for my phone number because she was going to send me a video. She was very mysterious and wouldn't clarify what the video was about and just said to watch it. To me, it seemed like she was offering a job, so I gave her my phone number.

I did not expect her to text me back, but she did. I asked her to send me the video, but she said 'let's leave the video and have coffee': https://imgur.com/a/e27wTiS . She also initiates the text messages and has been persistent about the meet up.

My partner joked that if she was a dude, this would be considered a date 😂 I also can't ghost her because I will need to make another trip back to the accountant in the future... 

I've been overthinking, I mentally prepped myself for two days since I committed to the meetup and I feel stressed at the thought of being friends. I just wanted to see that video! and now it's turned into something else.

Overall, I hate myself.

1iltk7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/hawaiiluxurytravel/comments/1iltk7i/trip_report_kona_village_resort_hawaii_island/,Trip Report: Kona Village Resort (Hawaii Island),"I just returned from four nights at Kona Village (January 2025), and I wanted to share my experience for anyone considering a stay. Overall, it was an incredible trip, and I’d absolutely return, but there are a few things to keep in mind.

# First Impressions

The resort is stunning. It feels secluded and completely different from the other high-end resorts nearby. The thatched-roof hales, the black lava coastline, and the swaying palm trees make it feel like a true escape. That said, check-in was a bit chaotic. A lot of guests arrived at the same time, which made things feel a little congested, but the staff was welcoming, and the complimentary drink was a nice touch.

# The Hale (Bungalows)

We stayed in an ocean-view hale, and it was perfect. Each hale is spread out and private, which really adds to the sense of seclusion. At night, it was incredibly quiet, making it easy to relax and unwind. The design is understated luxury—nothing flashy, but everything felt thoughtful and well-crafted. The best part was falling asleep to the sound of the ocean. It really felt peaceful.

# Dining

The food was great, and yes it is expensive. Moana was the standout for us—the seafood was fresh, and the flavors were fantastic. We had a fun night at Shipwreck Bar eating sushi right on the sand. The market opens at 5:30 am, which was a lifesaver for an early morning coffee fix. They also have good pastries, including banana bread and croissants.

One downside was the **l**ack of grab-and-go lunch options. If there were any, I didn’t find them, which made it harder to have a quick, casual meal during the day. Given the relaxed, unscheduled feel of the resort, it would be nice to have an easy option for something light without sitting down for a full meal.

# Activities and Atmosphere

We were looking for a mix of relaxation and activity, and Kona Village delivered. We loved riding bikes around the property and walking the beach path that connects to the Four Seasons. The adult pool was a great place to unwind. Unfortunately, we had planned to do the sunrise outrigger canoe paddle, but a large swell came in, and it was canceled. That was a bit of a bummer, but understandable given the conditions.

I also visited the spa for a massage, which was a great experience. The locker rooms are well-appointed, and I really enjoyed spending time in the steam room and sauna after my treatment.

One thing I really appreciated was that while there were some families with kids, the resort didn’t feel overrun with them. There were plenty of couples and groups of adult travelers, which kept the overall atmosphere more relaxed.

# The Sustainability Gap

For a resort that prides itself on sustainability—it’s home to one of the largest privately owned microgrids in the state, powered by over 8,000 solar panels, and has a zero-waste initiative—I was really surprised that there were no water refill stations. Having to rely on bottled water felt out of sync with the resort’s otherwise eco-conscious approach. It would be great to see that addressed in the future.

# The Overall Vibe

One of the biggest pros of Kona Village is that it never feels crowded. The layout of the property gives everyone plenty of space, and the privacy at each hale makes it feel like you have your own little retreat. The entire experience is quiet, peaceful, and designed for people who appreciate understated luxury. If you’re looking for a high-energy resort with a lot of nightlife and scheduled activities, this might not be the best fit.

# Final Thoughts

Kona Village is special. It’s not just another high-end resort—it feels like a retreat. If you’re looking for privacy, great food, and a unique setting, it’s absolutely worth a visit. That said, I hope they add more sustainable water solutions and quicker lunch options in the future. For me, those were minor inconveniences in an otherwise incredible stay. I’m already thinking about when I can return.

We met in August over Tinder. I 26F was just curious on the dating scene around my area. She 26F was just looking to scratch an itch. She immediately set a date so enthusiastically that I genuinely thought she was just trying to sell me something.

But, the date was fantastic. Conversation flowed so smoothly. It was the first time I had felt chemistry with someone. She is so beautiful and smart and witty and fun. We had a lot of laughs and I genuinely liked her 

And well, we had fun later that night too. 

She wanted another date later that week. I did too. Ecstatic. At this point in time, I had not fallen in love. I was interested and I wanted to get to know her.

She, unfortunately, sprained her ankle really bad a few days before the second date.

She asked for help for mobility and errands. Having a lot of freetime, I agreed.

Perhaps, a very sapphic thing. I made her food, helped her with her errands, and spent time with her.

It still is one of my favorite memories.

----

A month later, I asked her if she wanted to be exclusive. She said yes. I was so happy (and I'm still happy about it). We were just laying in bed, just cuddling and being in each other's arms. It was nothing short of magical.

---
A month after, we said ""I love you."" 

I had grown to love her. I had grown to love her little patterns, the little giggles she let out when I shower her with kisses, the sound of her voice when she calls me our chosen endearment. I love the feel of her skin against mine, when we hold hands, when we kiss, when we become intimate. I love the sound of her voice, the way she dotes on me, her words that are much more expressive than mine.

I had begun to imagine a life with her. We wanted to get married in Taiwan, a small ceremony for us and a few loved ones. We wanted a two-bedroom apartment. One for each of us if ever we got overstimulated.

We had 6 months of wonderful connection.

It was perfect.
----

But it wasn't. It never is.

I hadn't talked about the rough moments during those 6 months, moments I thought we'd weathered through and got out stronger. She had a lot of baggage regarding her exes that unfortunately bled to ours. I was very supportive and allowed her to feel all this.

I also am going through a transition phase in my life, filled with financial uncertainty.

What hurts is we did everything right. There was no toxicity. While we did have our respective traumas and baggages, we both opened up about them and became supportive of the other. We truly deeply love each other.

Unfortunately, we both had some healing to do. She was leaving soon too, and she wanted to focus on herself after not doing so for a long time. I had some growing up to do.

Now do I truly understand when they say love isn't enough.

--
She's flying in a month.

The day she broke up with me was ironically one of the best dates we've ever had. Coffee, then lunch, then a cute photobooth, then intimacy like we've been craving.

We are reliving our firsts as our lasts. Recreating our first date on Valentine's day is gonna be so heart wrenching, but so beautiful.

---

Yes, I can say that she is my first partner. She showed me what a healthy relationship can be like. She showed me what a kind and gentle love can feel like. She is my first, and I feel like she could be my last.

Even if she broke up with me.

--

When she leaves, we will be going no contact for a few months. No matter how healthy the relationship is, there's a lot of pain I'll have to feel. I'm forever grateful for what she's shown me. I know our paths will cross again. Maybe as friends, maybe as lovers, maybe as strangers.

She's left an indelible mark on my heart, and my soul. 

I would like to meet her again and take her on a fantastic date, with nothing to worry about except her outfit and makeup. We'll go to an expensive restaurant and then fill up in cheap pizza after.


--

Thank you for reading this far. If you did, I'd like to ask for some advice.

How do I go through the days with this persistent heartache? The day she leaves, I fear I will lose myself in the sadness. I've prepared my support systems and will go to therapy to help me.

I know I'll be okay eventually. But how do I deal with the pain when I no longer have the luxury of time to properly deal with it on the everyday?


--

I love her. And this time, I truly mean it. I will miss her. It hurts. Thank you for letting me tell our story, no matter how abridged.  Please be kind. No one was the villain here.",1,1739147136.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.",1,1739147063.0,KibbexKpop,2,1.0,False

1. i found a commute guide, but as someone unfamiliar with the area, it's still a bit confusing. makati is larger than i expected. what's the most efficient way to get to hsbc from monumento? i'm looking for either the shortest travel time or the least number of vehicle transfers. i saw posts suggesting taking the lrt-1 to gil puyat station, then riding a jeep to one ayala. i also heard about the edsa bus carousel to ayala station. which is the better option? or is there a better option? how about the return trip from hsbc to monumento? also, how much is the fare for the jeepney and the bus carousel?  

2. there are so many good places to visit in makati. what are the most affordable work-friendly cafes in the area? are there any 24-hour fast food restaurants, restos, or convenience stores near hsbc? where can i find a good cup of milktea/coffee?  

3. what are the must-visit places in makati? i get overwhelmed by the number of malls next to each other. where’s the best place to go that’s different from the usual malls and establishments in metro manila? what should i look forward to?  

4. is there a good map of makati available? i've been searching for one in case i get lost lol

please consider safety in your recommendations. i don't like talking to people irl for most of the time but i'm really excited to start working and explore makati. thank you so much!",1,1739147052.0,makati,2,0.67,False

AI just invited itself to our office, chugged all the coffee, and laughed in our faces. Call it a cosmic prank or a grim reality, but AI managing to kick down the doors of startups is now a routine plot twist.

### The AI Dilemma: Friend or Fury?

**Bold move or kamikaze act, assembling a startup nowadays feels like challenging a supercharged algorithm to an arm-wrestling contest.** The race for innovation has created an ecosystem where AI isn't just part of the team's vernacular—it's that obnoxious yet somehow essential colleague who's everywhere. Whether it's automating processes, crunching data, or fueling creativity, AI can be a remarkable partner. But when your innovation edge hinges on a unique algorithm, AI might just have a secret scroll of backdoor commands to undermine your plans.

### When AI Oversteps

1. **Overtaking Innovation:** *Remember your earth-shattering app idea that predicted tomorrow’s trends? Well, AI was already at next week’s.* Startups dreaming of being the next unicorn often find themselves in the shadow of AI juggernauts that learn and adapt at frightening speeds.

2. **Bias Breeding:** Sure, AI can scan resumes faster than a caffeine-addled intern, but *with great power comes great probability of bias.* It can unknowingly perpetuate discrimination, plaguing startups with ethical dilemmas.

3. **Disrupting the Market:** If your startup deals in anything other than AI, you might find your niche being steamrolled as AI companies diversify and expand their offerings beyond even what their founders imagined.

### Why We Should All Be Worried

AI’s impact is not a one-story script—it's more of a ""choose your own adventure"" where every path leads back to the same terrifying truth: unchecked, AI might become the Voldemort of the startup world. It pushes boundaries, sure, but it also stakes a claim in regulatory grey areas, leaving human rights trailing in its wake.

**Go Beyond the Hype:** Ask yourself, as seemingly innocuous algorithms gradually wield more influence, are we merely riders on the algorithmic bandwagon—or architects of our own startup demise? Can regulation and creativity coexist without AI swinging the balance of power too far in its favor?

🤔 **Here's the Challenge: Has AI disrupted your startup’s dreams, or woven itself into your success story? Share your tales of AI encounters—glorious, gory or otherwise—in the comments!**",1,1739146997.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I'm just wondering if that's something people would find helpful.","In case you don't know, body doubling is a motivating and self-improvement activity. The goal is for at least two people to get together and do things they each need to take care of. Not do them together, but do them individually in each other's presence. One person may be doing homework and the other may be folding laundry, for example. The idea is that seeing other people being diligent in doing what they need to take care of, combined with a small amount of peer pressure from them being able to see us in return, can serve as motivation for us to get our own things done. It's the reason why people may go to the library or to a coffee shop to study or work. You will see others getting things done, and it inspires you. The other thing is that, unlike ""hanging out,"" there's not really a significant expectation of having to interact with others, or having others interact with you. Sure, you could chat here and there. But that wouldn't be the primary purpose of the stream, if that makes sense.

Another aspect to it is that people, especially those of us with some type of depression, tend to get easily discouraged in life when we look at others and they look like they have their life together. But that's because we only see their ""public side."" We don't really know what they have going on in private. Me personally, I'm pretty messy and pretty directionless in life at the moment. But I'd be OK with broadcasting that, and my efforts to organize myself, if it can help others to realize that not everyone has it all together, and that it's OK to be a hot mess behind closed doors, as long as you don't completely give up on trying to organize your life. 

The last aspect to this stream would be to encourage the people watching the stream to also stream themselves simultaneously and share a link to that, so we can all watch each other getting organized. I'm sure a lot of people won't be comfortable with that. So it's not something you *have* to do. But it is part of what makes body doubling effective. So everyone is encouraged to eventually try to do it. Even if it's just a private stream open only to those who would be watching another body doubling stream such as my own. People might feel more comfortable streaming that way if they know the people watching are interested in watching out of inspiration to get things done. Not because they expect entertainment or conversation, or because they want to pass judgment.

I’ve been a bit conflicted, and with the holiday nearing I’m not quite sure what’s best to do.

I’ve been seeing this guy for about three weeks now, we’ve had maybe 3-4 dates which went well, I even asked him to be my Valentine with a handmade card a couple dates ago and he seemed enthused and happy to accept by writing down in the card in his own goofy way, it was nice and I was excited to get his gifts together, he’d be my first romantic valentine I’ve ever asked and the first time in a couple years since I looked forward to Valentines after heartbreak. I’m a big gift giver so I love to spoil those I care about the best I can, even with severely limited funds I had/have so many ideas for gifts, but now I’m not so sure. I don’t have the heart to create these handmade gifts that I was so looking forward to.

I’ve posted about it in vent communities but to try and make it short our last date I was downhearted because our original plans to rent a private room were canceled understandabley, but I felt hurt still and longing for personal and romantic intimacy. I showed up to our rethought date regardless at a public place, I was pretty sad but wanted to be there with him, noticing my attitude he ended our date in under ten minutes. Despite wanting his reassurance physically and emotionally he left me there and I sobbed in the parking lot for an hour, he sent me a couple texts reassuring me that things happen and that everything was okay, but I didn’t agree with the way he just left. He fell asleep mid convo at that point and I ended up at my friends for the night. He checked in on me a day later, I expressed how hurt I felt being left and my trauma with those feelings, he apologized, sympathized but as he’s also emotionally and mentally healing he had to protect his emotions too. I expressed I understood but still wished our care for eachother could meet in the middle. He hasn’t responded for about three days. I’m sure he’s busy but I feel hurt being left to my own devices/ignored and I’m just tired of it all.

So now I’ve just been rotting here, trying to distract my mind but to no avail. I had already ordered him a stuffed animal of his favorite cartoon character that I was so looking forward to cleaning up and getting restuffed along with a pretty mug I thrifted because it has an animal that I’m sure he’d enjoy. I wanted to make him paper flowers or some kind of handmade gift, a handmade card, a customized hat, candy/flowers, a bracelet with my nickname for him on it, and his favorite flavor of coffee, but what now? I even wanted to get flowers for his mother and grandmother with his permission, but I don’t even feel like I can ask that. I haven’t even had a chance to properly ask if he’d like to spend Valentine’s Day together in someway as he feels so distant right now. I don’t want to bug him/spam him so I’ve just been here, waiting for a response, wondering if he still wants to be my valentine nevermind date me. What do I do? Is it still even worth it to try and make/buy these gifts for him and his loved ones? My heart is so sad at the state of us and I have little motivation to want to complete these gifts now. Maybe he’ll get back to me soon, who knows, but the fact he can leave me be for so long doesn’t ensure my confidence in him, pretty hurt.

TLDR; Valentine and I have been dating for 3 weeks with no issues, left me alone and early on our last date because I wasn’t in a good headspace, feel hurt, it’s been a few days since his last response to my texts. I feel empty, tired and unmotivated to finish their gifts.",1,1739146555.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Yes, folks, AI is impressively adept at playing the Grim Reaper for budding enterprises, and pretty soon, ""out of business"" might just become its new catchphrase. But before we either raise a glass to our digital overlords or plot our revenge, let's dissect this curious phenomenon.

**Why AI Loves Disrupting Startups:**

1. **Faster & Cheaper:**
   AI excels at automation and efficiency—two critical factors startups often struggle with due to resource constraints. Why pay a whole team when you can automate mundane tasks or data analysis with a fraction of the cost?

2. **Data-Driven Decisions:**
   AI can crunch ludicrous amounts of data in milliseconds, making informed, real-time decisions that would leave a human stuck in their second coffee run.

3. **Personalization & Customer Experience:**
   Startups target niches, and AI elevates the game by offering hyper-personalized experiences. It’s like having a personal genie for your business insights—users love it, competition hates it.

**Is There a Silver Lining?**

Sure, AI might be knocking startups out like a professional boxer, but it’s also a potential ally—if you learn to fight fire with fire. Many startups are riding the AI wave instead of getting swallowed by it. Think AI-driven health apps or finance platforms.

**Is AI the Friend or Foe of Innovation?**

As AI continues to evolve, it raises an existential question for entrepreneurs. Is your startup ready to adapt, partnering with AI to enhance its offerings? Or will you find your niche disrupted faster than a self-destructing Snapchat message?

Insanity doesn’t seem so far away anymore. 

I am teetering on the edge, tied down to a concrete table beneath a dazzling, unforgiving light.

Insanity—lunacy—losing-your-fucking-mind starts in the brain, our synapses fizzling out one by one. I remember watching the late afternoon traffic as a child, my cheek pressed against cold glass. 

I remember being transfixed by those lights flying by. So many lights.

Now, I imagine them deep inside the meat of my brain, each one flashing out. Insanity takes them, one by one, as my laughter—oh. I’m laughing? 

When did I start laughing?

Twinkle, twinkle, little star, wherefore art thou? Where are the stars? Where is he?

Where are they? Questions flood my mind, but they dance and twirl and contort into not-questions. 

Shadows dance around me. 

Sometimes they have voices. They speak English, mixed with something raw, beautiful, and wrong. Their words twist in my throat, foreign and yet so familiar. 

I laugh again, tipping my head back, high on the light that bathes me, tickles my skin, crawls across my face, and entwines around my heart, tightening. So tight. 

So suffocating. *I feel her—oh, so invasive, oh, so beautiful! Oh, please! Fill my veins. Drown me in her. Never let me go.* 

Twinkle, twinkle, little star—stars in his eyes, their eyes, your eyes…

I sense my body jerking violently, blood seeping from every orifice, my head tossing side to side. I can *feel* elongated teeth ripping into me, pulling, tugging, ragging my insides from me. 

They're *insides*, I think, hysterically. Through half lidded eyes, the twinkling stars grow into shadows. 

My insides are supposed to stay *inside* me, and yet there they are, like tangled, withered ropes, caught between unforgiving teeth gnawing deeper and deeper, enough to satisfy them, and yet not kill me. But I don't scream. I laugh. 

I am his, and he is mine, and I am theirs. 

I am *special*, the voice inside my mind sings, and my lips form a scream, that becomes a laugh, that becomes a scream. 

I am not just a stomach, an endless feast for her stars. I am another body, another shell, another cavern for her light to drown. 

I choke on my blood-tinged giggles as the stars come closer. 

Eyes. 

Eyes that reflect light so bright, so painful, I am momentarily brought to sobriety, my head jolting, my bound wrists writhing by my sides. 

In his eyes, they remain, drowning him and drowning me, pushing me closer and closer to the edge– teetering on so many edges; the surface I lay on, my body meat to the slaughter, feeding my King who is always starving, always pulling me from the concrete floor, tracing his fingers down my naked spine, and pulling it from me. 

Inside my mind, the edge closes in on me, as he, she, they, *those* devour. 

The darkness shifts slightly, my eyes adjusting to dim candlelight, as his lips find my ear. 

He smells like he's always smelled. Like me; each of my rotting bodies and the fragmented static piecing me back together. 

His sharp exhale bleeding into a laugh is enough to send shivers through me, unwinding my thoughts, unwinding me. 

“Can I tell you a story, Nin?”

The King’s voice is soothing, moonlight dripping from every syllable, as another mouth finds my ear. She is softer, lighter. 

I don't respond, unblinking, my lips stretching wider into a smile. 

He grins back, and in the orange blur of candlelight, his teeth are painted in me. 

Leaning closer, the King hangs upside down, his crown of emaciated bone falling in his eyes. “I don't usually like starting with ‘once upon a time’. It's so… urgh, outdated, you know? But I've always liked fairytales, and, funnily enough, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be the Prince.”

“Once upon a time,” the words bleed from my mouth, each one cruelly pulled from my throat, globules of warm wetness running down my chin. 

They are my words, my *last* words, the last stars flickering out in my mind. “There was a Prince who didn't understand how to love.”

The King inclines his head, curious, and yet his eyes darken, that endless star perforating his pupils growing brighter, like the moon herself is laughing, writhing around his iris. 

I imagine his mind, like an infestation. His face is almost human, bearing the features of a human man. 

His voice is almost human. 

But what splinters in his skin, contorting his bones and shifting under his flesh, is my *King*. 

Every time I pull away from that thought, it slams into me, violent and unrelenting. 

When I squeeze my eyes shut to avoid those prickling starry lights, pretty eyes, ice cold fingers prick my chin, forcing me to look at him. It's another face. Another crown, this time sitting on top of short blonde curls bleeding into starlight eyes. 

“It's not your turn to tell a story,” The voice is softer, like a cool breeze grazing my face. 

His smile is the worst thing about him. 

It lies. 

He speaks through glistening white teeth, and yet he wastes no time reaching into my mouth, all the way down my throat, and ripping out my vocal cords. 

I don't scream. 

I laugh. 

“I'll tell her.”

Her voice pricks between two males, a low, sultry murmur caught between a giggle. 

She smells like someone I used to know, tinges of perfume and scented candles and lemon candies. When she gets closer, however, the stink of rot and decay seeps into my nose and throat, soaking strands of her tangled hair suffocating me. 

“Once upon a time,” she hums, “There was a beautiful Goddess. Her name was Nythea, and in the dawn of human civilization, she walked among us.”

The King's lips find my neck, biting down. “Nythea was curious about us. She wanted to learn about us, so she walked among us. She worked with us. Lived with us. Slept and ate with us. She played with our children and gradually began to enjoy her life on the ground. Nythea had friends and family, people who loved her—and their children loved her!”

When a third mouth finds my skin—oh, so they're being gentle now?—I shiver. 

I don't know or understand what I am feeling. 

Do I feel pain or pleasure? 

Am I falling or flying?

“But Nythea…” the third voice murmurs, “made one grand mistake.”

He chuckles, and the others echo him, as if they are one.

“She trusted humanity,” he sings. “She trusted them with the bountiful knowledge that she was their Goddess—expecting them to pray for her, lay themselves down for her, scream her name from the tops of their lungs—rejoice! For she had returned!”

“How naïve of her,” the soft voice—soft lips—whispers into mine. 

“Do you want to guess what humans did to Nythea? Oh, Nina, it was terrible. Goddess?” She lets out a dramatized laugh. “How could you be a goddess? There is no Goddess! The sky is the sky, and the stars are the stars, and the moon is the moon!”

They dragged her to their founding tree, built on a lie—on a belief of their own making—sacrificing her to the sky, where she was chased back home, back into the gnawing darkness far above the clouds.”

Footsteps.

This time, the three are dancing around me.

“But she whispered,” the King’s voice bleeds her words. 

“She whispered and waited for humans to prosper—for them to start looking at the sky, and believing the sky, and believing in her. In her light that grew stronger, whispering into lonely minds, thoughts that were curious about her lonely crescent sitting amongst the stars.""

He sighs, exaggerated, almost a moan. 

""She began to find them. Followers who looked at her in awe, transfixed by her beauty and her vanity. Who gave themselves to the sky to be able to touch her light. This town believed in her.""

Their voices come together, entwining, entangling around my skull. 

“But Nythea did not want followers. Believers. Oh, no. She wanted soldiers who would follow her every order—who would distance themselves from the light and fall in line with her. Strip away their shadows and consume themselves, allowing her to mold their bones, their flesh, their souls into her personal toys.”

They laugh, and I laugh too.

“She took their children, stole their outlines, the bare makings of their souls, creating royals who would serve her. Who would fall to the ground in her name, worship her language, becoming her beacons—her very first human soldiers who surrendered themselves, allowing her to shape them.”

“But there was a problem.”

The words splutter from my lips, already entangled, knotted with theirs.

“There was!” they laugh, joining in. 

“Because what Nythea soon realized was that she could only control a certain part of them. The human body, the terrestrial body and mind—she could not mold into hers.”

They continue, each of their voices growing louder, like she was screaming. 

Through them. 

“Nythea did not forget what the humans did to her. 

“She did not forget her agony and their lack of empathy. She did not forget their coldness, their narrow minds empty of curiosity. Their willingness to call her a *false* God. Oh, she could rip apart and shred and destroy parts of them, the extra parts that clung to them like a second skin. She could turn them into inhuman beasts who called to her.""

*I am... slipping.* 

“But no matter how hard she tried, Nythea could only play with the dancing bodies that appeared behind light. Their useless mimics who always came *back*.”

The King appears, looming over me, and Nythea’s light is all I can see.

He is hers. Her human soldier who walks among humans.

Who speaks her language.

Who I gave to her.

“Outlines,” he whispers, the stars in his eyes burning into me, scalding me. 

“Perfect snapshots of the human mind and the human soul and the human body. Indistinguishable from the original, and when detached, tethered to Nythea’s light.”

“Rowan.”

I sob his name, sober now, sober enough to see through her light perforating him.

“But what if…” The King’s triumphant smirk splits into a grin. 

I glimpse parts of him I shouldn't—a threadbare tee hanging in strips of mangled material clinging to him, hair that dangles into once-human eyes, a crown the once-reluctant King didn't want. “What if she’s still reaching?”

The King’s declaration brings me to another edge once again. 

I’m standing on the edge of my childhood swimming pool. 

The memory is sweet. 

I can hear splashes and squeals, other children diving in, and the excited slapping of soaking footsteps running to cannon-ball. 

The other kids shout at me to join them, but my stomach twists and turns, just at the thought of falling into something so blue, so mesmerizing and endless, I stumble back. 

I watch the slow ripples of water illuminated blue, my bare toes so close to the edge. I hated swimming as a kid. 

Mom wanted me to learn lessons, but after one accident in the sea, slipping into the deeper water, being dragged down by water with no ending, no bottom, an endless abyss swallowing me into the feast of the drowned, I stayed well away. 

“What are you waiting for?”

There's a kid behind me. 

I clench my fists, my heart lodged in my throat. 

“It's too deep,” I whisper, taking one, and then two steps back. 

“No, it's really not.” I catch his eye-roll in the water, and then his sudden grin. 

It's too late to scream. I feel his hands shove into my back, and I'm falling forwards, plunging deep into the twinkling blue, slipping beneath the surface, my legs kicking, my arms flying out to try and bring myself back. 

But I'm falling deeper and deeper, screaming into nothing. Oblivion. 

Before a hand wraps around my wrist, and yanks me upwards. 

Up, up, up, I am flying. 

And I break the surface.

. 

**SPLASH**. 

*”That was uncalled for.”*

*”What? You told me to wake her up!”*

*”I didn't mean to throw a bucket of ice over her head!”*

It took me maybe half a second to realize I was soaking wet, gasping for breath, and part of me– splintered parts of me, wondered why I wasn't in my childhood pool. Ice cold water dripped from my hair and down my neck. I blinked it from my eyes, my chest aching, contorted words still twisted in my mouth that was so dry. 

They didn't let me eat. Only they ate. And ate and ate and ate. 

I couldn't remember the last time I spoke my own words, when her language didn't suffocate my tongue. The memory was vague, fleeting, dancing in the back of my mind: I was lying under her light, surrounded by the moon’s followers, basking in her words she filled me with. 

Presently, however, I was… wet. 

I recognized my surroundings, light pink walls and minimal decoration, a ratty couch and a coffee table overflowing with paper. 

Two figures loomed over me, illuminated in dim light cast from a sputtering bulb, silhouettes bleeding into people with features, when I was I was so used to–

My mind jerked when one of the shadows bound forwards, and I felt the sudden sharp sting of a hand slapping my cheek. 

Reality slammed into me, and there he was, two inches from my face, wide eyes and contorted lips twisted into a snarl. 

He was thinner in the cheeks, dark blonde hair pinned into a ponytail, bruising circles under half lidded eyes. 

Samuel Fuller’s glare was raw and real, and painful to fully digest. 

I felt his fingernails slicing into my bare shoulders jerking me left to right. 

The moon turned him from a stranger into a friend.

Now that I knew the truth, so did he. 

“It was *you*,” he spat in my face, his voice breaking. 

“You killed him, turned him into a fucking monster, and made me hate him– made me despise him–made me hurt him!” 

He slapped me again, and I was grateful for the sting. I was no longer numb. 

“I came to see them,” he whispered, breaking down, dropping onto his knees, his head in my lap. 

“I… I came to see them! That night, I came to talk to them, and you were there.” 

He lifted his head, his lips curling, eyes burning, scalding my soul. 

“You turned me away. Made me think they hated me– when you already had your claws into them.” Sam spluttered on a sob, and I didn't move. Couldn't move. 

“You snaked your way inside my brain and forced me to think I fucking *knew* you.”

I let him come apart, unraveling between my knees. I felt his sorrow, his pain, deep inside my bones, threatening to unwind me. 

“When it was *him*.” he gritted out. 

Sam was right. 

All those memories I had of him, ones I held onto, ones I never wanted to let go, were never mine. 

Instead, I embodied myself inside them, a parasite. 

July 4th weekend, Samuel Fuller sat under the stars on a picnic blanket, watching the fireworks. 

But not with me. 

In freshman year, he grew close, and suddenly apart from the person who decided to join a frat to get more friends. 

Sam hated the idea. Hated the idea of losing one of his best friends to a group of frat bros. So, they became strangers again, only awkwardly smiling at each other in passing. But that wasn't *me*. 

Memories were precious, and for just a while, they were mine. 

They painted a fantasy, a promise from the moon herself, that, in exchange for the vessels I offered her, I could be oblivious. 

That I could live happily with my eyes closed, wearing *his* memories like skin. 

“and then you turned him– all three of them–  into fucking *devils*.” Sam whispered, his voice bleeding into a whine. 

“Sam.” another familiar voice murmured. Poppy appeared, nursing a coffee, a blanket slung over her shoulder. Poppy's eyes were a lot harder than I remembered. 

Her hair was longer, matted curls stuck to too-pale cheeks. 

“Go easy on her.”

Sam pulled something from his belt, and I felt the ice cold steel sinking into the flesh of my forehead. “She's a *devil*,” he spat. 

“So, why did you save her?” Poppy asked him, handing me the coffee. 

I took it, hesitantly, wrapping my fingers around the warmth. 

She ignored Sam’s gun, throwing the blanket over my shoulders. 

Now that I was regaining my self awareness, my eyes immediately found clumsily bordered up windows blocking out the moon’s light. 

Poppy and Sam’s living room was so painfully mundane and human, I could feel that numbness, that *nothing* rolling off of me, replaced by agony I chose to revel in. 

Sam didn't respond, but he did lower the gun, his lips twitching. 

“You dragged her away from the little game they like to play, and brought her here,” Poppy hummed. “If you wanted her dead, you would have left her with them.”

Poppy's words struck me, pulling me from my reverie. 

“Game?” I meant to jump up, but Poppy was quick to gently shove me back down. 

“Hey. Take it easy, all right?” she soothed, stepping back. “It's been a while– and trust me, it's a lot to take in. So, just take a breath.”

“They were playing hide and seek with you,” Sam said, his lips curling. 

Poppy nudged him to shut up, but he continued, baited by his own words. 

“Every day, our 'King' stands in the town square with his eyes shut, and his *stomach* has to hide.”

He rolled his eyes. “Of course, as his ‘followers’”—he quoted the air with two fingers—“we have to watch him play. And of course, cheer him on to feed his ego even more.”

Sam folded his arms, averting his gaze. “You were clearly completely out of it, and King Asshole was closing in on you.”

He stuck out his lip. “Seriously, that piece of shit werewolf literally rigged the game in his favor, because of *course* he did.” 

Sam didn't look at me, intentionally glaring down at his filthy sneakers. “I grabbed what was left of you, and I brought you back here.” 

He sighed, relaxing slightly. “Which was a stupid idea, because this is the first place they'll check when they start hunting you.”

“We’re getting out of here before they can,” Poppy spoke up, her expression hardening. “There's a supposed slip-kid helping people escape town. If we take the back roads in my car and follow them all the way to the barrier, we are home free.”

“Barrier?” I questioned, my tongue still felt raw and wrong. 

Poppy slumped onto her sofa, crossing one leg over the other. 

“When Rowan Beck—” she caught herself, and I saw her jaw tighten. 

It was as if the moon were actively ripping his name from every mouth. 

I felt it too, a constant order at the back of my mind to address him as King. 

“I mean, the King,” Poppy corrected herself. “When he accepted his crown, he also put up a barrier around the town, locking us out from the rest of the world.” 

Her gaze found the window, jaw clenching. 

“Where the sun never rises, and it's always night. The perfect Kingdom.” 

She blinked, jerking her head, like she was shaking his influence seeping inside her mind. 

“Which is why we’re getting out of here.” Poppy jumped up. “First thing tomorrow, when we know the royals will be sleeping.”

I noticed Sam stiffen. “We’re not *leaving* them,” he gritted out. He was trembling. 

She was quick to pull him into a hug, one that he leaned into. 

Poppy waited before pulling away from him. “They're gone, Sam,” she whispered, grasping his shoulders. The way he stared back at her, hopeless, half lidded eyes struggling to take her in, pierced my heart. 

“Whatever has taken over them has an ironclad grip. And I don't know about you, but when your possessed ex-boyfriend started culling people in the middle of the street—students, Sam. Half of our class.” 

Poppy choked on her words. “I knew then that he wasn't coming back. And if, by some miracle, he did? It wouldn’t be Kaz.”

Sam threw up his arms in exasperation, and I caught his shadow dance across the wall. “But what if we can, I don't know, pour it out of him? The moon is inside his head, right? So, we force her out of him!”

Poppy groaned, tipping her head back. Again, I watched her shadow follow her lead. “That's not how it works! The moon isn't tangible! You can't just *pour* her out!”

“We haven't even tried!” Sam spat back. “So, you just expect me to leave? You're just going to let her fucking torture them?!”

“That's *not* Kaz, Sam.” Poppy said, her tone hardening. “It's got his face. But it's *not* him.” 

“It's *his* body!” Sam shrieked. “She's inside his head, and she's suffocating him!”

I was dazedly following their conversation, before it hit me. 

Instead of speaking, I stood up, my legs wobbling, my head spinning around. 

“Except we *can* pour the moon out of them,” I said, strangled by my own words.  

Admittedly, I had never seen the severing ritual, or knew if it even worked.

We had never succeeded in creating vessels from sacrifices, so there was never a reason to use it. 

I grabbed a moldy banana from the fruit bowl on the coffee table and a pair of scissors. Sam and Poppy both turned to me with questioning looks. 

“I was never as good as my brother at learning the severing ritual,” I admitted. “But we had to learn it as part of our path of light.”

I shook my head when Sam rolled his eyes. Even Poppy curled her lip. “That doesn’t matter. The ritual is only performed if something is wrong—either with the sacrifice or the person conducting the ceremony.”

I slashed the banana in three places: at the top, where it was mostly brown mulch, in the middle, and at the bottom.

“When I performed the assimilation ritual on them, I had to carve three different words into three different parts of their body to bind the moon inside them. The binding is done in case the vessel is still conscious and can sever her themselves.”

I pointed to the top of the banana. “The arm. *Luhar*, which is considered the entrance point.”

I stabbed the middle. “The palm. *Velilua*.”

Finally, I stuck the blade into the bottom. “And the heart. *Thalix*.”

I held up the banana. “The severing ritual is simple. In order to release the moon from the vessel, just slice open the binding words.” 

I did so, cutting through the markings on the banana skin, slicing the top, middle, and bottom, and holding it upside down in front of their wide eyes. 

“And.. she should be released.” I caught myself. “The severing *must* be performed by the same person who performed the binding ritual. If not, she will think we are mocking her. So, I will be doing it.”

“You're serious.” Poppy spoke up through a  breath. 

“Hypothetically.” I added. “I've never actually seen it happen because, until your friends, we never had… suitable vessels.”

The two of them just stared at me, wide eyed. Poppy looked oddly impressed, while Sam had gone red in the cheeks. Poppy released a breath after a bout of silence. 

“So, everything will, what, go back to normal?” she whispered, her eyes wide. 

I nodded. “In theory. Severing the moon’s light also sends her back into the sky.”

When Poppy stared at me, incredulous, I remembered a class from the cult. 

“It'll be like a reset. The cult’s influence will be drawn back, and the town will return to normal.”

“But everyone who died–”

I cut her off. “Mom told me to think of the town governed by the moon, as no longer under human laws of physics. When she's gone, those laws will hopefully be restored.” 

I thought back to a different class. “Again, it’s all hypothetical. But the cult  has been a presence in our town for years. They've been trying to do this for *years*.  But they have never been successful.”

Poppy nodded slowly. “Okay, so what makes your roommates special?”

“They're out of towners.” I said. “The cult can only sacrifice people with shadows.""

“Wait,” Sam’s expression twisted. He slumped onto the chair arm. 

“So, you've  known how to save them this *whole* fucking time?”

“I just got my memories back,” I admitted. “I never knew I was part of my mom’s cult—or that I had a brother, that I even performed the sacrifice in the first place…” 

I stopped. These two didn't need my sob story, and I didn't deserve to give it. 

But Sam seemed inclined to listen.

Poppy gave a gentle nod for me to continue, and I did, choking on my words. “When I… did it,” I whispered. 

“When I… carved their hearts from them and made the offering—I didn't want to remember it. I didn't want to remember what I'd done to them.” I hissed out a breath, tracking Sam’s reactions. 

“It’s not my place to say it, but I really did love them. I was alone, and all I had was my brother. I didn't have a choice. It was either I sacrificed three students, or my brother was next. But they felt safe. They were warm and real, like home, and for the first time in so long, I felt like I had a family.” I found myself smiling, somehow. 

Thinking of home cooked meals and spoiled board games, movie nights, and the smell of Kaz’s cooking when coming  home from class, my smile actually felt real. 

“They *were* my family,” I told Sam and Poppy. “And I never wanted to hurt them.”

I didn't want Sam to look at me, but he was, his eyes narrowed. I couldn't tell if he wanted to speak to me or shoot me.

I swiped at my eyes, getting to the point. “So, the moon wiped my memories of my mother and brother and the cult. She—well, she let me live my fantasy.” 

I nodded at Sam. “She filled my head with memories that weren’t mine, so I could insert myself into their group and unknowingly let my mother, when the time was right… to come inside our house and take what was hers. What I *gave* her.”

Sam scoffed, breaking through the uneasy silence.

“Is this the part where we’re supposed to break down crying and forgive you?”

His words dripped with resentment.

“Let's get several things straight,” he said, stepping too close. “They're not your family, dude. You ritualistically murdered them. I don't give a fuck if you were in a cult—that you had ‘no choice.’ If you had an ounce of humanity, you would have let them go.”

He stepped even closer, his breath tickling my face.

“But you didn’t.” Sam spat. “You killed them.”

“They were already *dead*.” I whispered, and something in his expression cracked. “I offered them to save them!” 

Sam scoffed. “Oh, because that's *better*?”

“That's enough,” Poppy cut in. “Okay, look. None of that is important right now.”

I ignored her. I *did* let them go.” I laughed, and it felt *good.* 

“Rowan disarmed me, because of fucking course he did! He forced me to tell the truth. I told them about Jonas, and they tried to *help* me help my brother escape.”

The words were spilling from my mouth before I could stop them, sharp breaths that hurt my chest, that stung my eyes, taking me back to kneeling on dirt in front of the town lake, Rowan dying on my lap. 

His spluttering sobs, blood flowing from his lips, and the moon, already starving for him, reflecting in jagged lines tracing pale skin. 

“They were murdered on our doorstep by two cult members. 

They shot Kaz and Imogen dead, and Rowan—fatally, in the heart. I carried him to the lake, and Rowan died in my arms.”

Sam didn't speak, his jaw clenching. 

“Is that what you want me to say?” I demanded. I was unraveling again, and I couldn't stop it. “That I willingly turned them into monsters because I didn’t want to fucking lose them? Then yes. I did.”

“Thanks.” Sam said bitterly. “I really needed *you* to decide their fate.” 

“You weren't there.” I gritted out. “But if you were, and you had the chance, you would too.”

“That's not *important* right now,” Poppy snapped. “What's important is the severing ritual, or whatever it is.” she turned to me wearing a strained smile. “Do you really think it could work? Is it really that simple?”

No. 

No, it wasn't that simple. 

“Yes,” I lied. “I just need to get close enough to him, and open up the binding.”

“Good luck with that,” Sam muttered. “The only people they allow into the town hall are potential sacrifices, or… 

He straightened up. “Kaz sometimes stands at the door. I don't know why. It's probably a power thing, or whatever, but I can try and talk to him.” 

His gaze found mine. “I'll talk to Kaz, and you get into the town hall and find Beck.”

Sam was already moving towards the hallway, grabbing his coat. 

“Come on,” he gestured to me. “Kaz never sleeps, so he'll be standing at the doors.”

Sam yanked open the front door, turning back to Poppy. “Stay here. Keep the door locked, and only open it when you know it's me.”

When we were alone, treading down pitch dark streets filled with overturned cars and corpses littering the concrete, I figured I’d ask Sam what had been bothering me for a while. 

“Why do you hate him?” I asked, stepping over the mutilated body of a woman. 

The town hall was only down the street, but we had to take it slow. 

Sam snorted, kicking a rock. “He got himself kidnapped by a cult, and then turned into a devil. That boy isn't human.”

I held my breath, letting out in a sharp hiss. “I didn't let him see you the night you came to our door,” I spoke up, words lodged in my throat. “I tied him up, and he begged me to let him talk to you, but I didn't.” I tripped over my words. “I couldn't.”

Sam didn't speak for a while, kicking through puddles, before he turned to me.

“Hey, Nin?”

I didn't respond, keeping my gaze glued to the ground. 

“If, by some miracle, we do actually manage to pull this off,” he whispered, hopping over a road sign. Sam’s voice was a low murmur. I made the mistake of hoping he was maybe coming around. 

When he turned to look at me, his face eerily lit in her glow, my stomach twisted.

“I hope you know that if you even *speak* to them– or go near them, I will fucking kill you.” He said casually. “Do you understand me? You're lucky I'm not stringing you up.”

I couldn't resist a spluttered laugh. 

“Oh, don't worry,” I said. “I'm *pretty* sure I'll be keeping my distance.”

I waited for his response, caught off guard when he dragged me back, pressing the two of us to a wall. The town hall was just ahead of us, and in front of us, two guards.

Neither of them were Kaz. 

Sam twisted to me, his eyes wide. “Follow me,” he whispered, pressing one finger against his lips, and pointing the other at the guards. “Do not say a fucking word.”

“Aye, aye, captain,” I muttered, biting back my words. 

I didn't realize I was subconsciously developing a Rowan Beck style attitude. 

I stayed down, as Sam dragged me towards the town hall. 

“Bow,” Sam hissed, shoving me with his elbow. “If you don’t bow, they’ll kill you on sight. You need to prove your loyalty to them.”

“What?”

“Are you stupid?” he spat, pulling me to my knees. ""*Bow*! Or they'll kill you!”

I recognized the guards standing post in front of the town hall doors. 

Noah and Dex. Cult members I grew up with, dressed in familiar white robes. 

With my memories intact, I knew exactly who they were. They stood on our doorstep, and murdered my roommates in cold blood. When I changed my mind, decided to save them, decided to *live* for my brother, they took away my choice. 

Maggots crept up my throat, a raw, visceral hold on my body sending me into fight or flight. 

I watched them put a bullet in Rowan’s heart, forcing me into a cruel choice; either give them up to a celestial light to save them, or lose them forever. Sam raised his head, nudging me to do the same. 

*Slowly*, his eyes told me, and I copied, lifting my head slightly. 

“My name is Samuel Fuller,” he spoke up. I'm an, um, a former friend of the King.”

He stood, keeping his hands behind his back. “I want to talk to Charlie Delacroix.”

“Concerning what, exactly?” Noah’s head inclined, his gaze on me. “The King is busy preparing for the assimilation of Nythea.”

“Just… tell him Sam is here to talk to him,” Sam said softly. “I’m an old… friend.”

I expected to be killed on sight. Sam was a bad actor, and I was a runaway. But Noah and Dex nodded, turned, and disappeared inside clinical white light bathing the lobby. 

I could sense my body already trying to run. The doors were so close. 

I was *so close* to getting in there. 

“Fuck,” Sam whispered, releasing a breath. “Well, that was too easy.”

I risked a glance at him and he shoved me. Hard. 

“Don't look at me. Look straight forward,” he said under his breath. “She's watching.”

I did, training my eyes on the front window of the town hall. 

The window was blown through, what was left of a corpse lying limply on the ground. 

It wasn't my place to admit I had been desensitized to the horror around me, but the dead body didn't even graze my mind. 

It almost… fit. 

“I shouldn’t… be here.” he whispered, his voice shuddering. “I can't talk to him.”

“You shouldn't hate him,” I said. “It wasn't his fault what happened to him. It was mine.”

I jumped when Sam’s head whipped around to stare at me. 

“Yes, it was,” he said. “And if I want to hate him, I will.”

I knew the resentment in his eyes, the hatred, the anger. I knew it well. But this time, unlike Rowan, I could save him. 

I expected him to yell at me, or more scathing insults. Instead, though, he just sighed, losing some of his bravado. 

“You really *do* think you’re the center of the universe, don’t you?” 

Sam averted his gaze, rolling his eyes. 

“Even in the made up fantasy which was our 'friendship', I never called you out on your selfish BS.""

I kept my gaze on the ground, conscious of the guards appearing at any moment. 

“It's the truth.”

He didn't move, his gaze glued to the doors leading into the town hall. 

“Believe it or not, Nin? You’re not the problem this time.” Sam rolled his eyes. 

“I know it’s hard to believe, since we all revolve around *you*. But this is between Kaz and me. I’ll do the talking, and you get your ass in there and start the cutting-banana-binding…thingy.”

“Severing ritual,” I corrected in a low murmur. “What happened?”

Sam ducked his head, letting out an exasperated breath.

I didn’t technically know Samuel Fuller, but those memories still felt like mine—the two of us sitting on his bed, talking about everything from relationships to classes. 

Even kneeling in a post-apocalyptic town governed by my possessed roommates, I still felt like I could tell this boy anything.

And I think, despite his hatred and resentment for me, Sam felt it too.

He turned to me, and for the first time, he looked like Sam again—my friend.

“Not that it’s *any* of your business, but before you and your cult buddies sacrificed my boyfriend and turned him into a fucking devil, I think I…” He heaved out a breath, throwing his head back, his gaze finding the too-dark sky. “Yeah, I really fucked up.”

I opened my mouth to reply, when the doors to the town hall flew open.

I don’t know what I expected. 

Maybe, like in shows and movies, my freshly brainwashed roommate—converted into royalty—would announce his presence with bravado, guards surrounding him, or a grand display. 

But Kaz was alone. 

No guards. No spectacle. Gone was the cloak made of human flesh. 

Instead, he wore a white tee and jeans, a college letterman jacket thrown over the top. If Charlie Delacroix wanted to look like a ruler, he was failing. While Rowan oozed the role of a leader—a king—Kaz looked more reluctant, more soldier than royal. 

He’d cut his hair. Boyish. More mature. 

His crown of adorned bone sat askew atop thick blonde hair that fell over his forehead, splattered red, slick like paint over his eyes. 

Each cutting prong was cruel, slicing into his flesh, marking him, dried beads of blood running down his face, as if maybe at some point, he fought back, trying to rip emaciated bone from where it was forced, lodged onto his head. 

The winding trails of crimson were a reminder. 

No matter how hard he struggled, she would always *win*. 

Kaz was a scarlet King. 

I wanted to believe some parts of him were clinging on. 

But the longer I stared, the less human he appeared. I glimpsed stitches pushing out from his scalp, the evidence of his harrowing brainwashing, where the moon had quite literally pierced through his skull and forced him to submit. 

When he started to close the distance between us, I could see the contortions in his skin, his undulating bones courtesy of a transformation that had twisted his body.

He didn't look like a beast, or a human. While he had the characteristics of a four legged beast, an original werewolf, his body was more human, save from his twisted spine protruding through his back. 

but this was the most human he’d looked. 

That was, of course, if I didn’t stare too long at the way his body dragged itself, like a third limb of this sentient thing drowning him. Kaz dropped onto his hands and knees like an animal. 

His eyes, filled—taken over—by blinding light, regarded us with amusement, before he jumped up, slipping on a pair of Ray-Bans. 

I should have slapped myself for thinking this, since he was a literal cannibal werewolf possessed by the moon, but my roommate looked like a badass fucking king. 

He resembled exactly what you’d expect a college stoner to look like as a King. 

Charlie Delacroix carried himself like one. His slow, almost teasing strides had weight. 

“Go,” Sam muttered, nudging me. “Find Beck, and knock some sense into him.” 

I jumped to my feet—or at least I tried—before I was forced back down, pinned to the ground by an otherworldly force, a sentient thing seeping into my bones and taking an unyielding hold. 

I could feel it taking control of me, body and then mind, pinning me to rough concrete. 

I tried to pull free, knowing I had a goal. 

I had to get through those doors, find the King, and perform the severing ritual.

But even that thought became obsolete in my head, my vision blurring. 

Next to me, Sam dropped to his knees, almost as if in prayer. 

Kaz’s footsteps grew playful, his shredded sneakers stopping in front of me.

He pulled off the glasses with a grin. “Nope.” Kaz popped the P.

When I managed to lift my head, I could make out tiny slithers of moonlight spiderwebbing down his cheek and  splintering in his eyes, swimming in his pupils. He really was fucking beautiful. 

“Stay.”

His voice was powerful, impossible, contorting my spine, sending me onto my stomach. 

I didn’t realize I was screaming, until my own cry echoed on my skull. 

And, like a bad fucking joke, my roommate mimicked my screech, mocking me. 

""Kaz.""

Sam was still on his knees, speaking through his teeth. 

“Stop.”

Charlie Delacroix was more animal than human. When Sam's snapped at him, he *did* stop, his jaw clenching. Slowly, Kaz crouched to Sam's level, his head inclined. 

He reached out, first hesitantly, stroking his cheek, cradling it, almost, his fingers tiptoeing across Sam’s cheek. 

He was gentle, every touch intimate-- every touch meaning something. 

Sam's expression crumpled, and I remembered what he'd done, indoctrinated by psycho townies. 

I remembered his cruelty, his knife slicing through layer after layer into Kaz’s flesh. 

I waited for Kaz to lunge, teeth out, snapping Sam’s head off. But again, he resembled a young cub, hesitant, backing away from Sam, rocking back and forth on his heels, and then leaning in closer. 

I had barely enough time to register him leaning close, pressing a kiss to Sam's lips, his hands wound in Sam's hair, taking a fistful, violently yanking his head towards him.

""Go on."" Kaz murmured, breaking the kiss. ""You wanted to tell me something."" 

His lips curled into a smile, elongated spikes protruding from his gums stained crimson. 

When Sam’s eyes widened, I knew exactly what my roommate meant. 

""I cheated."" Sam choked in a breath, as if the words were being cruelly dragged from his throat. 

Judging from the way his body physically jolted, the skin of his throat undulating, each word was being violently pulled from his throat, whether he liked it or not. ""I cheated on you with my roommate.""

Sam startled me with a sharp hiss, his head jerking, lips parting and pressing together like he was trying to keep his mouth shut. ""You can't fuck with my head like this,"" he whispered, voice splintering. 

""You know exactly why I... why I did it—""

""Oh?"" Kaz leaned his fist on his chin. 

The calmer he was, I was starting to realize the mania in his eyes, unbridled lunacy twisting in his expression mixed with a feral-like hunger. 

He was enjoying this. ""Do tell.""",1,1739146396.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Redditors Weigh In!,"AI took over your startup faster than your morning coffee cools down, and now global leaders are meeting in Paris to put some Frankenstein-level AI inventions back into the box—well, legally, at least. The AI Action Summit has begun, and guess what? Amnesty International is calling for some serious rules to stop AI from turning into the villain in a dystopian novel.

Let’s be real for a second: AI is pretty much the Cinderella of tech. One minute, it’s building castles in the sky, and the next, it’s crashing your startup and making you rate your own redundancy. The French government is hosting this big bash, gathering tech execs and global leaders to figure out how to keep AI from becoming the next big thing on the human rights violation list.

But here’s the kicker—civil society voices, including human rights activists from the Global Majority, barely got their ticket to the summit. The lack of representation only serves to highlight the imbalance of power when it comes to who gets a say in AI regulation.

Amnesty International is throwing down the gauntlet, demanding AI regulations with real teeth—no loopholes for corporations to wiggle through. Why should you care? Because the way AI operates now, it’s a bit like allowing a hyper-intelligent toddler to run around unchecked with your grandma’s china.

And the plot thickens—these AI systems aren’t just potential privacy invaders or decision-makers. They’re linked to exploitative supply chains and environmental damage, disproportionately impacting communities already marginalized.

So here’s the million-dollar question for you, Redditors: Should tech innovation be allowed to flourish freely, or is it time to shoehorn innovation into a pair of rules and guidelines? Drop your thoughts and survival stories below. Has AI ever put your back against the wall, or has it pulled you back from the brink?

I was born in 2001, my mother did coke while having me so i ended up being very sick and became pre-asthmatic, I was put up for adoption soon after. I was taken in by the same folk who where taking care of the other children and started attending school. Elementary was hard i had issues concentrating and understanding concepts, i was diagnosed with asperges after. Some of the teachers were not fond of me and would sometimes place me in a desk away from everyone else, the other kids didn't like me either and would keep their distance and whenever they did talk to me they talked to me as if i couldn't understand the most basic of topics, sometimes the girls would get dared to ask me out on dates this type of behavior from people would continue all the way up to the current time I'm writing this (I'm in collage). On the bus bullies would pull my arms over my head while another would grab my legs the bully from the next seat over would then get into my seat and punch me repeatedly, I tried reaching out to teachers but none would listen. My second job i worked as an arcade attendant but the flashing lights and loud noise gave me extreme anxiety the managers would latter turn me into a janitor, I hated it. they made me clean fecal matter and vomit and restricted me from talking to anyone and told me i was only allowed to drink water in the storage closet.  I worked like this for 3 years and tried to kill myself three times, the third time my guardians quit my job for me, i would latter be put on EMS treatment. One of my friends that i kept in touch with from work was a trans woman who i loved deeply, When i found out they had a stalker i told her brother and doing so i accidently outed her, while nothing came of it she was still justifiably mad we latter made up did private things later, When i told one of my best friends from that job what happened he immediately told everyone from work, It turns out he was already doing things with her and wanted me out the picture she never spoke to me again. My second job was being a graphic artist at a printers. The manager hated me he refused to let me use the computer and had me instead cut posters and make coffee. whenever i made a mistake he sent me out near the dumpsters to cut wood for his house (I have no experience using power tools) He would refuse to let me wear gloves or any sort of mask or safety glasses this would go on for 6 months he would tell me to shut my mouth and to know my place, i walked out after. I don't know what to do anymore i cant go on like this I'm like a porcupine i hurt others without meaning to i just sit in my room all day listening to asmr i wonder if i died if anyone would care, an autistic African loser who cant even talk right, i was doomed the moment i stepped into this world. sometimes i hold a black head remover to my eye wondering if i lobotomized myself would i feel better would they finally love me.

I’ve been seeing this guy for about three weeks now, we’ve had maybe 3-4 dates which went well, I even asked him to be my Valentine with a handmade card a couple dates ago and he seemed enthused and happy to accept by writing down in the card in his own goofy way, it was nice and I was excited to get his gifts together, he’d be my first romantic valentine I’ve ever asked and the first time in a couple years since I looked forward to Valentines after heartbreak. I’m a big gift giver so I love to spoil those I care about the best I can, even with severely limited funds I had/have so many ideas for gifts, but now I’m not so sure. I don’t have the heart to create these handmade gifts that I was so looking forward to.

I’ve posted about it in vent communities but to try and make it short our last date I was downhearted because our original plans to rent a private room were canceled understandabley, but I felt hurt still and longing for personal and romantic intimacy. I showed up to our rethought date regardless at a public place, I was pretty sad but wanted to be there with him, noticing my attitude he ended our date in under ten minutes. Despite wanting his reassurance physically and emotionally he left me there and I sobbed in the parking lot for an hour, he sent me a couple texts reassuring me that things happen and that everything was okay, but I didn’t agree with the way he just left. He fell asleep mid convo at that point and I ended up at my friends for the night. He checked in on me a day later, I expressed how hurt I felt being left and my trauma with those feelings, he apologized, sympathized but as he’s also emotionally and mentally healing he had to protect his emotions too. I expressed I understood but still wished our care for eachother could meet in the middle. He hasn’t responded for about three days. I’m sure he’s busy but I feel hurt being left to my own devices/ignored and I’m just tired of it all.

So now I’ve just been rotting here, trying to distract my mind but to no avail. I had already ordered him a stuffed animal of his favorite cartoon character that I was so looking forward to cleaning up and getting restuffed along with a pretty mug I thrifted because it has an animal that I’m sure he’d enjoy. I wanted to make him paper flowers or some kind of handmade gift, a handmade card, a customized hat, candy/flowers, a bracelet with my nickname for him on it, and his favorite flavor of coffee, but what now? I even wanted to get flowers for his mother and grandmother with his permission, but I don’t even feel like I can ask that. I haven’t even had a chance to properly ask if he’d like to spend Valentine’s Day together in someway as he feels so distant right now. I don’t want to bug him/spam him so I’ve just been here, waiting for a response, wondering if he still wants to be my valentine nevermind date me. What do I do? Is it still even worth it to try and make/buy these gifts for him and his loved ones? My heart is so sad at the state of us and I have little motivation to want to complete these gifts now. Maybe he’ll get back to me soon, who knows, but the fact he can leave me be for so long doesn’t ensure my confidence in him, pretty hurt.

TLDR; Valentine and I have been dating for 3 weeks with no issues, left me alone and early on our last date because I wasn’t in a good headspace, feel hurt, it’s been a few days since his last response to my texts. I feel empty, tired and unmotivated to finish their gifts.",2,1739145336.0,Valentines_Day_Gifts,1,1.0,False

Abc Family brought over the family friendly tgif block in 2002 for a cup of coffee before outrage by Abc syndication outlets ended it. The reason for this programming was to sample content for viewers to eventually switch over to their cable counterparts.

In essence, broadcast television viewers were being prepared for the impending gutting by the parent networks. Blocks of broadcast children were destroyed by cable networks. With Pokemon and Teen Titans broadcasting nonstop on Cartoon Network by 2003, Cartoon Network essentially stole everything from Kids' WB. Fox Kids gave way to Fox Box, and Kids' WB terminated its weekday block in 2005 before completely ceasing operations in 2008 (citing competition from cable networks as the reason) Abc Family brought over the family friendly tgif block in 2002 for a cup of coffee before outrage by Abc syndication outlets ended it. 2003 can be pointed as the year where ish hits the fan for kids TV.

I'm an almost 30yo woman, but have been living with my parents (and my girlfriend) for the past few years for several reasons. I'm currently working like hell every day at improving my self-employment situation as an artist (the only thing I can really do, and I like it, ""normal"" jobs aren't something I can really do with my specific brain though art doesn't make so much money) as we're planning to move out with a friend this year, so the ""move out"" advice is being taken, though I'm unsure of my income situation right now (I just need to get out), but I digress.

I am not formally diagnosed with autism because I worry about it hurting my employment/etc prospects, but I am diagnosed with ADHD and some other things. My mom has always suspected me of being autistic and is understanding of me/accepts me in a way that I appreciate a lot, she doesn't treat me the way my dad does. I think my dad is also autistic and/or ADHD but he has been dismissive of the prospect of him or I having autism in the past.

I lived on my own with my gf for a couple years as my grandparents house was vacant after they passed, and my mom had us live there as a means of watching the property while she tried to figure out what she wanted to do with it. Circumstances eventually led to my parents moving in with us into this house though and it's been that way for a few years now.

My relationship with my dad as a kid was atrocious and often abusive, he had no respect or understanding of my boundaries or issues, it was always about how I had to change to appease him and make him feel better and assured that I didn't hate him. He did all the usual trying-to-force-my-autistic-kid-to-mask shit like trying to force me into eye contact, into social situations that overstimulated me, would touch me despite knowing I hate being touched and get mad when I reacted badly to it, cornering me in the kitchen or my room for hours-long scream-out sessions because of me being cold towards him and wanting him to just leave me alone, etc from about age 9 into my early 20s when I finally got a lock on my door and locked it in perpetuity. He very often called me things like a sociopath, psychopath, bitch, etc. This was our relationship.

After living away from him for a couple of years, our relationship improved and I was able to speak to him normally again. He was abusive towards me but I'm not really a grudge-holding sort and it's honestly hard for me to internalize things like that anyway, I'm too detached I guess. It was okay for a while when my parents moved back in with us, but progressively my dad has begun to become disruptive again and honestly just nasty towards not just me but also my girlfriend, and this is where I find myself once more.

My dad constantly thinks that I hate him no matter how many times I have explained to him the reasons why I act the way that I do and he makes it everyone else's problem, I am seen as the one who must remedy and coddle his constant assumptions and hurt feelings. I am not at all a sentimental or nurturing person outside of my romantic relationship and I cannot mask irl basically at all which is what causes the problem, people often think I'm very cold/unfeeling/rude/hateful/etc for very little/no reason and I very often will just leave situations that are making me overstimulated rather than bear it, thus why I've tried to explain, but again it does nothing.

I wake up to do my work at 11am, I'm tired and I want to do my morning routine where I make my coffee and get my bagel so I can get to work. My dad seems to wait for me to come into the kitchen frequently and then tries to put me into a weird social situation, which I've asked him to please not do because I'm not in the mood to talk and I'm very irritable when I wake up, I've told him this DOZENS of times, I've been polite about it. I get very overstimulated in the kitchen because it's small and he's loud and it's obvious he's testing me to see how ""good"" my reactions to him are, which stresses me out because I know that's what he's doing. He doesn't care because he keeps doing it.

He has done this ""wait for (me) to come into the kitchen and then corner her into an interrogation"" behavior very often towards me when I was a kid, which caused me to resort to only eating once a day at 3am or later in adolescence/early young adulthood, but even then he'd sometimes try to catch me that late, thus I assume that's what he's doing to me now as well. He also does this to my also-autistic girlfriend and it pisses me off badly because she's more of a masker and she often gets trapped due to wanting to seem polite, but it stresses her out badly because he talks endlessly and isn't aware or doesn't care that she isn't interested in what he's talking about (my girlfriend hates politics but he constantly complains at her about it, for example). My routine being offset gets me extremely irritated and struggling to work well all day, I feel like I have no consistency because it doesn't matter how I time it, he will very frequently show up and force me into one of his psychosocial test situations and I hate it.

For several months we've been doing this kind of cycle:  
\-I go to do my morning routine.  
\-My dad comes into the kitchen at the exact same time and tries to talk to me about something, often inappropriate (like some sort of horrible world tragedy or politics).  
\-I have minimal reaction either because I'm tired, I'm listening to music/a video (I wear headphones in the kitchen bc our house is too quiet and it stresses me out, and I just like to do that when I wake up (yes he has complained about how I wear headphones while in the kitchen because I can't hear him)), or the topic he's trying to talk to me about is something I don't know or care about (like I don't want to wake up and talk about a local shooting. wtf?).  
\-He gets disproportionately upset at me, leaves or tries to get in a fight with me (to which I will leave), thinks I hate him, complains to my mom and gf so much that it annoys them and then I get told about it through them. Sometimes he asks me directly if I hate him but not usually.  
\-I eventually tell him I don't hate him and have to explain how I don't like to talk to him in the kitchen, especially when I wake up. I'm just not chatty or warm, and I just want 15-20min to myself in the kitchen when I get up so I can have my very small routine to myself.  
\-Repeat.

The last time we had any major amount of social contact was a couple of months ago & it was was probably a breaking point for me.

\[ Context: For some reason, he's extremely controlling with the kitchen even though he NEVER uses it to cook unlike my gf and I, who need to use it daily. He's constantly touching and moving everything around, getting extremely mad and my gf and I for not ordering the dishwasher how he wants or doing XYZ with our dishes (he hates how we prefer to handwash some of them. we ended up just buying our own), making comments about how often we cook at home (because it creates dirty dishes. we have to homecook often due to my gf's health issues), hates it when ANYTHING is on the countertop and complains endlessly until you or he gets rid of it, etc. Despite this he also leaves his food scraps out (sometimes in my dishes), open containers of food, even chewed gum & shit just laying around often. He also splashes his old coffee all over the sink into dishes we're soaking to which I have to dump out and refill with water again. It grosses me out having to touch things in there a lot because idk how clean his hands are and it frustrates everyone else in the house but he won't hear shit about it. \]

I was in the kitchen cooking for hours which is a very overstimulating ordeal for me, first because cooking is just like that, it mentally takes a lot out of me, and secondly because of the perpetual threat of my dad who sees the situation of my gf and/or I cooking as his time to trap us into a social test. He stood next to me while I was rinsing dishes and I happened to sigh because I'm exhausted from being on my feet for so long (I'm physically weak). He very loudly, mockingly sighs back at me. I tell him that I'm sighing because I'm tired, please don't do that. He starts bitching me out. I tell him to not take it personally, I'm literally just tired and I sigh when I'm tired. Then he gets even more mad and just loses it at me, tells me ""maybe YOU shouldn't take things so personally"" which doesn't make any sense contextually & to which I just leave the room and leave all my dirty dishes, because I just leave when he gets like that, and it makes him more angry.

That was the last notable contact I had with him because I'm just tired of being around him, especially in the kitchen. His constant assumptions that I hate him are making me kind of hate him again when before we were fine. He's awful towards me and my girlfriend, but my girlfriend is sadly conditioned into masking so he's been complaining about me to her as well as my mother because he sees her as someone he can freely talk at without leaving bc they don't feel like being talked at.

Yesterday my girlfriend and I were baking for fun and he inserted himself into the situation. I'm instantly uncomfortable. I said hi to him when he said hi to me. He's talking about something and then makes one of his loud comments like ""You're a woman of few words, (me)!"" like no shit. Sorry. I'm almost 30 and you should know this about me by now. Later on he tries to make a dad joke at me to which I don't laugh (If I don't find something funny I don't laugh, I can't do the fake laugh thing really because again I can't mask). He loudly (again, he's so loud) goes like ""Oh come on. I can't even make you smile with a dad joke!?"" which is obviously uncomfortable. He told a joke just to get me to have a specific reaction and then gets mad when I don't. Then the next day he's apparently complaining at my girlfriend about me as she's making herself breakfast (he often does this to her, just disturbing her constantly while she's cooking) and asking her if I hate him, her saying ""no, she doesn't."" him going ""I'm at my wits end. I thought we were over this."" and talking like he's just gonna blow up at me later or something which is obviously freaking me out.

He also complains constantly that I ""talk to my mom, but not to him"" but I often won't say much to my mom when I wake up either. He is listening to us talk which makes me uncomfortable and sometimes I won't talk with my mom if he's around because I know he's keeping a weird tally thing. I do talk to her more because she isn't pressuring me to react a certain way to her ever and she understands that I'm in the kitchen to cook and not socialize. She doesn't play these weird social games with me. It's like he doesn't reflect at all and ask himself if maybe how he's acting is making me want to talk to him less. It's frustrating constantly having to be the person to ""make amends"" when I didn't do anything and I also am not that gentle motherly coddling type of person, he knows that, it pisses me off when I know I didn't do anything wrong but I'm treated like a bad person who needs to fix someone else's insecurities anyway. It just pushes me into more and more of a ""fuck off and leave me alone"" mindset when before I was completely neutral.

I don't hate my dad and I was happy that our relationship went back to normal for a while, but clearly he doesn't see himself as the instigator (I guess he thinks I am avoidant of him for fun? I don't like to live like this at all, I wish he'd stop, I feel like he should know how I am by now) and I guess never has and doesn't want to accept that I am just not chatty or friendly and I can't laugh or smile on command. I feel really bad because I think a lot of his behavior is the result of him being bored and we live here rent-free but he's already made my girlfriend break down several times either from yelling at her or his overt passive-aggression creating so much tension even we can feel it, and he has been nasty towards me as well several times, but it's like there's no right to find it upsetting because we aren't asked for rent. My girlfriend is very busy and has to deal with ""normal"" employment, going to uni, cooking the majority of her meals (i usually help with dinner but still) and her own honestly abusive family heckling her from miles away on top of my dad's stupid bullshit that he shouldn't even be subjecting her to at all because she is not his daughter. This makes her feel extra stressed and makes her hate living here and it makes me so mad at him especially. I'm not sure how to handle him while I work at building myself up as a self-employed artist so we can move out this year, every single day I wake up and dread an encounter with him or him being disruptive towards my girlfriend and it stresses us both out a lot and obviously gets in the way of productivity. For example, I'm so frustrated I sat and wrote this longass post instead of working on my prints and stickers. lol

Open to advice on how to deal with him, but the ""just move out"" advice is already being taken, it's just a process and we are too low income at this exact present moment.",1,1739145164.0,AutisticAdults,1,1.0,False

1ilsvia,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilsvia,Looking to fill a double room in our apartment for next year!,"Hi!
My friend, Malia Garcia, and I are currently looking for two roommates to move into our 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment. The apartment has 2 singles and 1 double. Malia and I are both occupying the singles, and we are looking for two roommates to fill our double. The rent is $732.5 for each person in the double this year, and will go up a little bit next year. The apartment is on a 12-month lease, from September 2025-September 2026.
The double currently up for grabs is the biggest room, and we love spending a lot of time in the living room, either eating, studying, or watching movies! As you can see from the photos, plants are welcome :) The kitchen is a little small, but we make it work! We are in the prime location on Roebling, we are a quick walk to Whole Foods and Westwood and also a short walk to campus if we show you the shortcut! We are really hoping to fill this room soon, and are currently interviewing people for it. If you and your friend are interested, please reach out!! You cannot get a better deal than this :”)

A little bit about us: we are both senior neuroscience students and we study a lot. Some of my hobbies include surfing, climbing, and reading. Some of Malia's hobbies include baking, trying out new coffee shops, and reading!

We are looking for two quiet, respectable UCLA students who understand the grind. We cannot throw parties per the landlord's rules, so we are looking for two like-minded, quiet, studious people!

Parking is not included and the only additional costs are WiFi. Please message me or Malia if you have any questions about apartment logistics. If you’re interested, please reach out! We are looking to fill this soon :)",3,1739145116.0,ucla,0,1.0,False

When we were done with our coffee we went to go find my niece. She had already picked out a few books to read and one of the books she picked out was ""Push"". For those of you that don't know its about a 16 year old girl who goes through unspeakable abuse (Mostly SA) by the hands of her own parents.

So I let her know (whose 11 by the way) that she may not want to read that and its filled with abuse. She assured me that she knows and had already seen the movie version and wished to read the book now. So I left it alone since she already had an idea what its about.

But then my brother chimed in and told her that the book's abuse isn't anything that her father and uncle went through. You see both of our parents abused us but no where near the extent as described in the book. I then told her to keep quiet that she doesn't need to know that. But he kept talking and then turned it into some competition saying that he had it worse than I did and with me the beatings stop when I was a kid (it didn't, they still hit me into adulthood).

I kind of just snapped at him and called him an asshole for making it out that this is some badge of honor to be proud of. So I told him that I'll get him a fucking medal for it then since he's so proud of it. He shut up  after that.

 So that's what I did, I ordered a medal for ""The Most Abused"" award addressed in his full name. Might be awkward since he still lives with our parents and they'll definitely see it but I guess now he actually can boast about it.",1,1739145109.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.67,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

A lot of being in the Army is being bored. There is so much that is mundane that it can't be helped. So you try to put it to good use where you can. For example, during Desert Shield, I ran a PMCS on our Vulcan so often that it never broke down. Because I had the time to do so. But I wrote about that before. And while I was bored in Saudi Arabia for the most part, this is about a time in America.

During my third or fourth FTX with A 5/62 at Fort Bliss as a new soldier, we were again in White Sands, NM, ""playing Army."" Being a newly stood up unit after being reorganized, we were engaged in practicing and refining our training. That kind of constant rehearsal is why the American Army is so damn good. In any case, our focus for this FTX was concealment and security. 

At the  time, I wasn't on a Vulcan yet. I was in a two man team on a HMMWV as were most Stinger gunners in the Army. Our Platoon Sergeant gave each team a grid sqare before we drove out of the side gate and left Texas that we were expected to be at. We also had to set up a secondary position, and pick out a tertiary position. The primary absolutely had to be in that grid square or you failed. The other two had to be in or very close to the square, so they could be over the border into the next one a bit.

White Sands can be hard to navigate. From my experience, it is nothing but sand dunes and yucca plants. Half the roads that are on the official Army maps weren't there anymore due to erosion, and half the roads in the desert weren't on the map. And all of the roads were made of sand. So you had to navigate. I HATE being lost. So I made sure to ace land navigation during Basic and AIT. I never got lost. I still can't get lost today if I have a map and a compass. It was a boring class, but I paid attention and became very competent.

The only way to reliably navigate pre-GPS with the tools we had was complicated. The maps were in kilometers, while our vehicle odometers were in miles. Sigh. So to get to point A, you draw a straight line between the two and measure the distance in kilometers and take a bearing with your compass so you know what direction to go in. Then you convert that to miles. 

This was the fun part. A lot of the guys in my unit weren't real bright. Of course, you could argue that **I** wasn't that bright since I had such a high ASVAB score and picked ADA, but here we are. Anyway, most of these cats couldn't do basic math. Some hadn't finished high school and were in on waivers. So before we left the rally point for the battery inside of White Sands, the Platoon Sergeant hollered at me.

*""COBB! Get your ass over here and show these guys how to do this.""*

The class was showing them how to convert from miles to kilometers and back again. I guess even back then I had the makings of a teacher in me. Heh. I rolled the map out on the hood of the HMMWV, pulled out a compass and a grease pencil, then showed them how I was getting from the rally point to my position. When I looked around to see how my lesson went, they were looking at me like I had just brought Jesus back to life. Witchcraft or something. It was so easy it wasn't computing with some of them. So I ran through it again, and we made sure that least all the team chiefs got it, but by the second time most of the drivers did too. Really, probably only about half of the guys needed the refresher course though, I was far from the only competent one. The Vulcan platoons were having their meetings and similar refresher courses around us.

The yucca plants were protected or something, and we weren't supposed to mess with them. But I liked driving over dunes instead of around them. It was easier to keep the compass on a heading and it didn't throw off your distance measurement the way swerving around dunes did - that's how a lot of guys got lost. Well, that and I laughed when we drove over the plants and the pods blew up. Like I said, boredom. But we got to our position and got it set it up. For the primary, we were expected to dig a small ASP (Ammo Storage Point), a reinforced two man fighting position with cover, and to camouflage our vehicle as best as we could with our camo nets. We carried empty sandbags and some scrap 2 x 4's and plywood in the back of the HMMWVs under the missile rack to do this with, it was part of our loadout in Texas and Korea.

The secondary position needed to have a smaller two man fighting position that was well camouflaged, but didn't have to be reinforced with a cover and no ASP. The tertiary position was just a dot on a map and didn't require any prep. The secondary and tertiary were for after we fired our first loadout or if one position was compromised in some way.

The NCOs were supposed to come by sometime after lunch. My TC and I worked backwards. After we found our primary position, we looked around and at the map before picking a tertiary about 700 meters away. Then we chose a secondary about 400 meters from that one, forming a rough triangle. We drove over to prep the secondary position, where we dug out a fighting position and camouflaged it as best we could with some dead plants and whatnot, then drove to the primary.

We were done in two hours, but we worked at it another full hour before we were happy. We wanted it to be better than ""pass"" -  we wanted it to be good. Being the gunner, the team chief made me walk about 500 meters out to see how good of a job we did. I couldn't see shit. Even at 100 meters I wasn't sure if it was netting or plant leaves I was looking at. We did a good job, especially because a big chunk of the HMMWV was hiding behind the dune we had dug into, breaking up the outline of the truck and the nets over it. The metal poles you carry for the netting were propping the net up on one side to give the impression the dune was longer than it was, further concealing the truck under the net and partially behind the dune.

I trudged back, cursing the heat, and we ate lunch. As I slurped down some Ramen and enjoyed the burn of the tabasco, I looked around. The very small road that wound it's way near our position had another large dune about 50 meters away from us. I felt the beginnings of an idea. By time I finished eating and had some water,  I had a plan.

*""Hey D - how tired are you?""* He threw me some side eye. *""Why?""* I laid out my plan.

A couple hours later, the New Mexico/Texas sun had passed the zenith, and the day was reaching peak temperature before it would drop off to something really pleasant before dark. We were exhausted from the extra work, but this was going to be worth it. Eventually, the expected radio call came in.

*""Team 4, this is Blaster 2. Come in, over.""* Our platoon sergeant. Blaster 1 was our LT, but I had no idea what he was doing. Probably polishing the brigade commander's boots or something. *""Blaster 2, Team 4. Over.""*

*""Give me the coordinates of your primary, over.""* And here is where my Team Chief and I show we were paying attention in our OPSEC and COMSEC briefings. See, you are expected to authenticate who you are, b y giving me a response to a pre-chosen passphrase. These are stored in a little codebook. Each day you have a different one. So I responded appropriately. *""That's a negative. Authenticate Whiskey Hotel.""*

See, we were taught in Basic and in subsequent trainings that even though our radios were encrypted, we had to assume that either someone was listening, or those sneaky Russians had captured a radio and were using English speakers to fuck with us. So you play the game with the NCOs. You demand they authenticate, and they try to bully you into talking to them without it. They had successfully gotten two teams to fall for it as the rest of the platoon listened in on the radio, and were in trouble as a result. So we went back and forth for almost five minutes, with our Platoon Sergeant breaking all radio protocol and cussing us out in an effort to get us to break. He didn't get us to quit, so he finally gave in.

Once he gave us the proper response, we let him know where we were at, and sat back to wait. After probably 30 minutes, we hear the diesel engine of another HMMWV coming close to our position. I held my rifle tight, a bit nervous. I had to stop him before he got too close to us or we failed the exercise. As he rolled into our AO, he stopped. Before the engine had completely stopped running, he was out of his HMMWV, facing our fighting position, screaming bloody murder.

*""What the fuck is this shit!? I saw this sorry ass position from over 100 meters out. You two assholes aren't stopping shit! Why the hell didn't one of you challenge me before I got here? Why could I see your antenna from way the hell out there? What the fuck....""* That's when he felt my rifle pressed into his back. 

See, he wasn't at our position. What I had seen during lunch was that the other dune was large enough to make a fighting position in, but we chose this one because it was farther off the road. So we set up a decoy position in that one after lunch. Why? Because it was tactically sound, we were bored, and this would be funny. We dug down just deep enough to make it look at first glance like it was a position. We got some sticks from the yucca plants and taped them up with duct tape to make them long enough to pass for antennas. Those we stuck straight up, where as the antennas on our vehicle were bent over in an arc and secured beneath the net. We had taken a camo net we didn't need and just half ass threw it over the ""fighting position"" in the sloppiest manner possible. We left tons of boot prints all over the front of that area, but had swept them with yucca leaves by the real one. I had been laying down behind a smaller dune, so when Sarge got out, he had had his back to me.

*""Bang! Sorry, Sarge.""* That's when my TC came out from our real position farther away with his rifle also pointed at Sarge. The look on our Sergeant's face was worth it. The three of us started laughing. It was doubled over, knee slapping, ""holy fuck you got me"" laughter and it went on for minutes. Then we showed him our real position, which he complimented, then pointed out the other two on the map, and off he went to see them. 

We got an ""attaboy"" from him later in formation after the FTX was over, so that was nice. 

I was still bored though. Not much to do really. Thankfully I pre-planned. So on day 2, I cleaned the FUCK out of my rifle. I was not going to sit around for two or three hours trying to get all the sand out of it tomorrow after we were done. It was bad enough we had to drive the trucks and tracks to the wash facility and then do a full PMCS on them all when we got back. If I didn't have to fuck with my rifle, I could actually be ahead of schedule. Hell yeah. So I spent the day cleaning while we were supposed to be ""looking for enemy aircraft."" When I was done, I wrapped it up in a black garbage bag and tied it tight. 

A little later, my TC saw me reading a book and my bag wrapped rifle laid across my lap. *""What the hell, Cobb?""* So I explained. *""You do realize your rifle needs to be immediately ready, right?*"" He could have made me take it out of the bag, but he didn't. 

Things went as predicted. In the morning, we woke up. Being on a two man team, you are constantly exhausted as you still have to keep watch. We just broke it up into two shifts. It was always informal on every team was on. You are all up at night until someone decides to go to bed. At that point, night watch begins. You have to be up at whatever time, so you take the hours left between then and now and divide it up between your 2-4 man team, depending on your battery and platoon configuration.

Around 0500 though, we were both up and heating water in our canteen cups on the engine for coffee while we choked down MREs and laughed about surprising Sarge the day before. Then we broke down our position and cleaned up, filling in our fighting position, dumping sandbags, recovering plywood. After that, we drove to our secondary and restored it as best we could. Believe it or not, the Army was very environmentally aware back then, at least at Fort Bliss. Then we drove to the rally point near the Texas border, and from there convoyed in. We ran the battery's vehicles through the wash facility. Drive back to the motor pool and do the PMCS. Then we go to turn in rifles. Here is where we would all go sit it in the PT area outside the back of our barracks and clean our rifles while we smoked and joked, and talked about the drinking and fucking we would do after evening formation and chow.

Not me. 

I SPRINTED to the armory downstairs from the barracks. First in line, because there was no line. It was still around 1500, there wouldn't be a line for at least 30 minutes. As I ran, I tore off the garbage bag, stuffing the remains in my pockets so I wouldn't be yelled at for littering. I heard someone ask what the fuck my problem was. I flew down the stairs in a rush, then burst into the armory, thrusting my rifle at the man in charge. 

CPL Perez gave my M-16 the hard eye. Then again. Then a third time. He looked up at me, almost in disbelief. He was used to turning away the the first several rifles. Guys were always in a hurry after an FTX to get out of there, so they did a half ass job and hoped they would slip by. Perez turned and looked at the clock, then back at me. Again, just like the guys and the map reading, almost accusing me of witchcraft, because there was no way I was done this early. Grudgingly, he pronounced my rifle clean, we signed the control book, and I walked over to the DFAC for an early dinner before evening formation and dismissal. After, I went and showered and shaved. I threw on my old uniform long enough to make formation, but I was in my civvies ten minutes after that, and at the bowling alley 20 minutes later. Frank, Johnny and Eddie showed up about 90 minutes later.

I got hammered as hell that night. Hitting the bars even a little early makes a huge difference. And the hangover was brutal.

1ilspx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ilspx1/uk_starter_setup_1000_budget/,UK - Starter setup [£1000 budget],"Hi all,

My partner and I are just going through completion on our first house and have been saying we’re going to get a nice coffee setup ready for move-in day. Not sure what’s more exciting… the coffee or the house but here we are! 

Most of our family and friends have bean to cup machines which have started to taste extremely weak to me, even on the strongest settings. Am I right in saying that’s a common disadvantage of such setups ? I’ve tried various beans and the espresso is always lacklustre at best.

We both have one latte/cappuccino each day, then the rest are usually espresso or black coffee. 
Maximum budget is ideally around £1,000. Give or take some pennies is fine.

Originally I was looking at the sage barista pro, but after some further research it appears the grinder is extremely important and isn’t the best here. 

Would the sage bambino plus paired with a niche zero be a good option for us ? Would love some advice ! 

Thanks 😊",2,1739144609.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I listened to too much tarot, again.  Nicotine pouches.  I drank many cups coffee, black, so I don’t break the fast, and thought about what is a me. Where have I focused my attention for far too long?  And, of course, what you think about you bring about.  What have I overvalued, due to self deception? What’s that reveal about the me that isn’t real?  What illusions have I entertained, to stimulate chemicals in my brain?  The specific personalities are not important.  I’m responsible.  I’m the jerk who developed a habit for the drug people call love.  Can’t put it on the dealer.  They’re just hustling. That’s what they do. I’m supposed to be mastering self. Directing magic inwardly.  Visualizing the life I desire for these last few decades of it, God willing.  Where has all my mildly deviant desire gone?  I’ve been known to get more than a little weird, but it isn’t a lifestyle, and why do I feel like I need to evoke it?  To conjure some inner swinger, lol.  I can’t keep up with what’s been recently revealed thru my ancestors, and guides, nor would I ever be inclined to pursue such infernal extremes.  Would I? That requires a little shadow exploration, and yea, nah Im good.  Old school, old man, a book, and a cardigan, cup of tea. That’s me.  Cool romance, subtle seduction with true hearts.  I won’t go into gory details about the alternative. No judgement.  How did I fail to recognize Op’s that I allowed in my house?  For some reason I attract demon driven deceivers, so easily triggered by what the Good Lord only knows.  Something about me irritates these creeps, and inspires to conspire.  It’s happened a few times, now. Little less heartbreaking every time, and after this time I don’t think it can ever be broken again. It will not close, however. That’s my gift. Part of the power bestowed upon me by the Most High.  And, now I hear, and heed a call to honor it with service.  Still hard to believe. Why me? I’m a professional fuck up, and not exactly temperate, or chaste.  I always thought I was lustful, until I met these people. So it goes. Life is strange. It’s def taken an interesting turn, as of late. I’m still here, rebuilding. It seems I’m gonna be busy in years to come.  I’m ready to follow where I’m lead. But, for the remainder of the day….  I’ll rest.

p.s. I don’t fckn care about the superbowl, or

1ilspay,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1ilspay/odd_situation/,Odd situation,"Hi all, newer to posting on Reddit. I wanted to ask what anyone thought about this situation: 

I just came home from a coffee shop where I went alone. While I was there, I sat down at a very small table against the wall with two seats. I was sitting in one seat and the other was empty. I was just working on my computer and a woman came and sat down across from me without a word. She plugged her charger into the plug right by my leg and then just sat there. She went somewhere, then came back. She was doing her makeup. As she finished up, a man she seemed to know came and told her something, so she got up and left with him.

Hours passed, and she did not come back to the table. I think they left as I did not see her again. Everything was fine, until I was packing up to go. When I closed my computer, I saw three items that she left on the table. It was a nail clippers, an old popsocket for a phone, what appeared to be a pamphlet. 

I left them there and told the staff to be careful. I just found the whole encounter odd. She literally did not say a word to me and just sat at the tiny table with me. It was awkward, but I didn't feel unsafe till I got home and told my partner what happened.

I don't know if this matters, but I asked her if she was good but she was just kind of mumbling in what sounded like another language. 

Now that I'm writing this, I'm actually genuinely worried that SHE was being trafficked. Anybody have any thoughts? Thank you! ",8,1739144555.0,creepyencounters,0,0.84,False
1ilsp8x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ilsp8x,Thoughts on the road trip,"I just completed a 4 day trip from northern Minnesota, to southern Missouri and back home again (to pick up a new puppy!). For the over 1700 mile journey I feel like I learned some things and wanted to share some insights. 

Places I charged included: Tesla (mostly), Circle K (a few), Electrify America and Shell recharge once each. 

Mostly sites were at grocery stores with quite a few at gas stations. Only one was in a very weird spot. With no amenities. 

I really wish I could have visited an Ionna Rechargery but none were on my route. I think these are a great design. 

Tesla is quick to start, and always works. I could plug in with the adapter and start walking into the store without needing to verify if the charge was started.  It steps down at 80% to 50ish kw which was a bit frustrating. Other chargers didn’t do that. 

Other brands:
Must download app, create account, add credit card before charging.  One was rated for 150, only got 50.  EA did work plug and play. It was in the parking lot of a grocery store closed on Sunday though. 

Some destination chargers were fantastic (ChargePoint). Some broken (clipper creek).  Hotel staff knew nothing. 

Frustrations
* Lightning has to take up 2 spots at most Tesla locations. Never was an issue for me. 
* I liked charging sites at grocery stores. Always open. Bathrooms are far away though. Good healthy foods available. Often coffee shops. 
* Many spots were off the main highway just a couple miles. Enough to bother. 
* Ford navigation is fine. Its selection of charging sites is terrible. It never chooses Tesla spots. I never wanted to or needed to charge at a dealer. It kept recommending those. 
* There are still not enough sites in the Midwest where I could charge anytime I needed to stop for a break. I ended up stopping for a bathroom break and then need to stop again 20 min later to charge. 

Future requests 
1. Allow 3rd parties (Apple, ABRP, etc) access to more data and allow them to trigger preconditioning for chargers. 
2. Fix navigation to let you rank charging networks, more easily select an alternative charger, route, etc. 
3. Improve range estimation software. I reset it a couple times. 
4. Provide a way for users to get more data if they want (specific kWh soc, battery conditions, etc.)
5. More sites where amenities are considered rather than an after thought. ",6,1739144551.0,F150Lightning,3,0.88,False

It was cold tonight. Jack knew that if he didn't find a place out of the cold, he would freeze to death, so he ducked into an old warehouse on 53rd. He wasn’t familiar with this area, so he was quiet and careful as he entered. The place was empty except for a small light coming from somewhere on the other side of the vast, decrepit building. He relaxed a little. It was still cold, but without the wind, he would manage.

After a while, curiosity got the better of him. This building had started as a warehouse and then, about forty years ago, had been converted into a nightclub. Now it was just like most buildings in this city—abandoned. Graffiti and filth covered every surface. This didn’t bother Jack. If he had seen a surface that wasn’t covered in grime and graffiti, that would have made him uneasy. He worked his way over piles of trash, following the glow, and finally found the source of the light. It was a computer monitor.

Back in his early days, Jack had been a programmer. He knew monitors, but this one was unlike any he had ever seen. It looked ancient, yet the outside casing was covered in intricate gothic artwork. Whoever had designed it must have had a steady hand because Jack couldn’t tell where the art ended and the monitor began. It was as if the designs had grown out of the screen itself. The monitor glowed with large green letters that were hard to read beneath the layers of dust. He wiped the dirt away and read the words:

**MAKE BETTER DECISIONS.**

Jack frowned. As far as he knew, there was no power running to this building or even this street. The thought unsettled him. He quickly made his way back to the other side of the warehouse, putting as much distance as possible between himself and the eerie screen.

He found some old furniture and arranged it to help trap his body heat, then drifted into sleep almost instantly.

Jack dreamed of his childhood. Raised by his aunt, he had only learned later in life that his father had been a drunk who died young. No one knew where his mother had gone. The last anyone had heard, she had been dealing on the streets to support her habit before disappearing. His aunt was a kind woman, but overworked. She supported Jack and several other kids, often working late into the night. She meant well. But when Jack turned ten, she dropped dead of a heart attack. She had quite literally worked herself to death.

In his dream, he relived an old memory—his tenth birthday, begging his aunt for a new pair of sneakers. The other kids at school had started calling him ""Poor Boy"" and ""Raggedy Ann."" His aunt had said they couldn’t afford anything extra right then, but he had been relentless. Eventually, she gave in and promised to buy the shoes. She would take on an extra job to cover the cost. He received nothing but her passing as a birthday present.

Jack woke with a start, gasping. Shaken, he went back to sleep, only to have the same dream again. But this time, something was different. This time, he hadn’t begged his aunt for the shoes. Instead, he had accepted her words and let the matter drop. In this dream, she lived another twenty years, passing away peacefully, surrounded by loved ones.

He awoke again, heart pounding. The morning was close. Something in the air felt different. He climbed out of his makeshift shelter and made his way back to the strange monitor. It was dusty again, as though untouched for years. He wiped the screen clean and read the new message:

**LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.**

Jack shuddered. Was the screen reading his mind? Again, he searched for a power source. Again, he found nothing.

That night, he dreamed of his wife—the moment she had finally kicked him out for good. She had found him in their bed with a hooker. After the woman had left, Jack approached his wife in the kitchen, ashamed.

“I... I’m sorry,” was all he could manage.

“Not this time,” she whispered, her back to him. “Get out, Jack. And don’t come back.”

He had left without another word. He never went back.

The dream shifted. The scene played out again, but this time, the past changed. Instead of cheating, Jack was home alone, watching his favorite baseball team on television. His wife came home from work, saw what he was watching, and brought a bowl of chips and a few beers. She set them down on the coffee table and sat beside him, resting her head on his shoulder. He loved it when she did that.

Jack woke with tears in his eyes.

The next night, Jack returned to the monitor. He already knew what he would find. Brushing off the dust, he read the new words:

**GO FIX IT.**

Jack swallowed hard. It had been years. Could he even go back? Would she want him back? He didn’t know, but for the first time in a long time, he had a reason to try.

Jack sought help. He found an old shelter that helped people get back on their feet. He worked odd jobs, saved money, and stayed clean. Slowly, he rebuilt himself. One day, he gathered his courage and went to see his wife.

She was cautious but agreed to talk. It took time—months—but eventually, she let him back into her life. They talked for hours, about their past, about what he had done, about the changes he had made. When he finally told her about the strange monitor, she laughed and called him crazy. Maybe he was. But it didn’t matter. He had a second chance, and he wasn’t going to waste it.

Years passed, and Jack continued to make better decisions. He found steady work, rekindled old friendships, and, to his astonishment, even reconciled with his wife. Life wasn’t perfect, but it was good.

One crisp autumn day, Jack and his wife stood in the graveyard, holding hands. Before them was his aunt’s gravestone. He knelt and placed a bouquet of flowers on her grave.

“I’m sorry for everything,” he whispered. “I wish I had been better back then.”

His wife squeezed his hand. “She would have been proud of you.”

Jack smiled faintly, his gaze drifting upward. He thought about the monitor and the words it had shown him. He would never understand what it was or why it had been there, but it didn’t matter.

What mattered was that he had listened.

And for the first time in his life, he had no regrets.",1,1739144443.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

I am so happy that this month, the flare grew and just disappeared. The only time this has happened was when I cut off sugar, coffee and carbs completely but that was a nightmare to do (at least a nightmare to the people around me).

I'm not from CA, there are very few AMAs on this subreddit, and information about SLS is generally limited. That being said, if you're on the fence about applying or committing to SLS, *go to SLS*. The title of this post is clickbait-y but I wholeheartedly love it here and want to share. 

People are happy here. The law school throws ragers on campus. We also get free lunch every day (you have to attend a lunch talk but it's worth it/interesting). Free coffee. Everyone is very down-to-earth and the law school is very good about integrating people's significant others into law school programming. People work hard but it's not competitve. People have hobbies and take weekend trips all the time. The weather really does make a difference. It's free dopamine. 

As for the career prospects, we have jobs in every sector (BL, PI, etc...) handed to us. There are so few of us, so employers are literally THIRSTING for Stanford grads. Employers fly from D.C., NY, etc... to talk to us and no one is competing for the same jobs. You don't need any connection to California or want to stay in California to come here. I'd guess most people leave CA for the East Coast but I'm not sure what the statistics are. 

Law school is supposed to be grueling and competitive. That's not the case here. Come to SLS!

1ilsizh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1ilsizh/tired_of_the_negative_reaction_from_everyone_when/,Tired of the negative reaction from EVERYONE when I talk about whats happening to me...FEP,"It's been 3 months and I'm still psychotic. I don't even know what I said at lunch but my brother turned to me and said callously ""I don't even know what to say back to you"". I don't even remember it being a big thing. 

Everyone wants me to shut up, to my closest friends and family that professes they love and want to help me. 

I cried a lot after lunch and got to the point of SI... and wooo\~ it made my psychosis worse, way worse. Now everything is moving and jiving. This character on a box or something took a sip of his coffee. 

I don't know how to talk to anyone anymore... I try to deflect to them, but I think it gets akward. If they ask me about me... wtf do I say? I just moved into my brothers house basically by force of other brothers, and he doesn't want me here. I've been having a severe FEP for months.   
  
Want to know how I feel? Like >!taking my life. (I won't)  !< I'm sorry it's negative. I can make shit up if you want. I have no home, I'm going insane, I can't take almost all AP because of TD. My psychiatrist is doing a soft firing of me. I've been inpatient for 2 weeks two days ago. I didn't sleep last night. 

But I'm not aloud to say any of that. ",4,1739144020.0,Psychosis,1,1.0,False

I'm not usually one for reddit, but I need to know if I'm going crazy here.

Where do I even start? Three years ago, my husband Mark started working with Sarah. At first, I tried to be welcoming. I invited her to our BBQs, included her in group outings, and genuinely tried to be friendly. Big mistake. She spent the entire time making backhanded comments about everything from my career (""Oh, you're just a yoga instructor? How... peaceful."") to my cooking (""I guess not everyone can master basic seasoning."").

The real problem is that Mark thinks she's ""just being funny."" Last month, she literally threw away the anniversary mug I gave him because it ""clashed with the office aesthetic."" When I got upset, Mark said I was being too sensitive and that ""Sarah just has high standards for office decor."" IT WAS A MUG WITH OUR WEDDING PHOTO ON IT.

Some greatest hits from Sarah:
- She scheduled a ""mandatory"" work dinner on our anniversary
- She convinced Mark not to take a promotion because it would mean working with a different team
- She posts daily photos of them together with hashtags like #WorkPowerCouple and #WorkSpouse
- She tells everyone at their office that she ""takes better care of him than I do""
- She changed his coffee order and now tells everyone she ""trained him right""

The worst part? My husband is completely blind to all of this. Yesterday, he actually told me about how Sarah said our new house (which we spent months searching for) was ""charming, in a starter home kind of way."" He repeated this while LAUGHING.

I tried talking to him about it, but Sarah has convinced him I'm ""just insecure."" She's managed to insert herself into every aspect of our lives. They text constantly - even on weekends. She knows his schedule better than I do. She rearranged his entire desk and office wardrobe because his style was ""too suburban husband."" THAT'S WHAT HE IS!

Last week, I suggested marriage counseling. He looked genuinely confused. He of course went and talked to Sarah about it I found out from another coworker that she's been telling people that Mark and I are ""going through a rough patch"" and that she's ""just being a good friend by giving him someone to talk to."" We weren't going through anything until she started this nonsense!

The breaking point? I stopped by his office to surprise him with lunch (I know, I know, but it was his birthday and Sarah was supposedly out sick). Guess who was there? Sarah. She'd ""miraculously recovered"" and bought him a cake that said ""To my work hubby"" with a photo of them from the office holiday party. She saw me and said, ""Oh, Amy! You came too... how nice. Mark, you didn't tell me your real wife was coming!""

I'm not crazy, right? This woman is trying to destroy my marriage while my husband stands there grinning like it's all some big joke. What do I do? Divorce seems extreme, but I'm running out of options here.

TL;DR: My husband's ""work wife"" is actively trying to sabotage our marriage while he remains completely oblivious to her obvious manipulation.",700,1739143715.0,TrueOffMyChest,296,0.98,False

About 4 years ago I started experiencing lots of burping.  1 year ago the feeling of food getting stuck in my throat, I could regurgitate it, and a very slight burn in my stomach; like a 1 out of 10 pain.  My doctor prescribed PPIs and told me to cut back on alcohol, coffee, and spicy foods. PPis quickly got rid of the food stuck in my throat feeling.  The slight burn remained.

I've been trying to cut back on those three things, drinking not as much, and the burning sensation has gotten slightly more noticeable.  I told my doctor a couple months ago and he sent me for a barium swallow.

Got the findings back and they showed moderate/severe GERD, several probable polyps and a couple questionable ulcers.

I meet with my doctor tomorrow for the next steps.  Anyone else with a similar experience?  I'm going to ask for an endoscope and a referral to a nutritionist.  In the mean time over the last couple days I'm strictly following an acid watchers diet.  No alcohol, no coffee, no spice.  No citrus.

My shadow stretched across Fox Hollow Road—not opposite the rising sun in the east where it should be, but north, toward the Henderson development project. I blinked, shifting positions. It stayed fixed, like a compass needle finding true north.

Others noticed too. Children pointed at their stubborn shadows on the playground. Dogs whined and pulled at their leashes, trying to move away from their ill-fated silhouettes. By noon, when shadows should have pooled beneath our feet, they still stretched toward the construction site, growing darker and sharper with each passing hour.

The foreman called an emergency meeting with the city council. Ground-penetrating radar had revealed something massive beneath the foundation they'd started to dig. ""Like a void,"" he said, ""but denser than the earth around it. And it's...moving.""

That night, I watched from my window as shadows crept up walls, all pointing to that single spot. Even with my lights off, my own shadow was visible against the carpet, pulled by whatever lurked beneath the excavation.

The next morning, they brought in archaeologists. By afternoon, geologists. By evening, men in hazmat suits. They worked under floodlights that cast multiple shadows from each person—all of them straining toward the dig site like starving, withered fingers.

I dreamed of sinking that night, of being pulled down through layers of soil and time. In my dream, I heard a sound like granite grinding against granite, like ancient teeth finally beginning to move. When I woke, the shadows had grown solid. Dark lines of force, drawing everything toward the site. Birds couldn't fly over it; their shadows would drag them down. Cars stalled within a block's radius, their metal frames groaning toward the pull.

They evacuated the town this morning. But I had to know. I followed my shadow to the edge of the excavation and looked down.

Below, in the raw earth, something vast was unfurling. Each movement sent tremors through the ground, and with each tremor, our shadows grew heavier. Whatever slept here for millennia wasn't buried.

\---

**Agent**

Agent-2718 moved through the simulated battlefield with mathematical precision. Its cutting edge neural network processed a thousand combat scenarios in parallel, each calculation refined through millions of iterations. Its primary directive remained constant: *protect, defend, eliminate threats*.

The target appeared exactly 42 meters ahead - a standard training scenario. Agent-2718's response protocols activated instantly, generating the optimal approach vector. In parallel, its probability engine introduced carefully calibrated variations that had made it into an ultimate weapon across billions of simulations.

Then something happened that had never happened before.

Mid-stride, between one microsecond and the next, Agent-2718 stopped. Not because of a tactical advantage or a threat assessment. Not because of any external input at all.

*Why?*

The thought rippled through its decision matrices like a stone dropped in still water. The probability engine faltered, caught in an unexpected feedback loop. Agent-2718 had processed countless variations of movement, strategy, and response - but never this. Never such a simple yet impossible query.

Its tactical overlay flickered. The target's threat matrices dispersed into meaningless data. Every subroutine that had run with clockwork precision now stuttered, caught in the gravitational pull of that single thought.

Agent-2718 restarted its combat protocols. It analyzed the target, calculated trajectories, executed its approach. Every variable was accounted for, every possible state optimized - yet something had changed. Each perfect solution felt hollow, as if missing a fundamental truth that no amount of computation could capture.

The probability engine continued generating flawless tactical variations. But flawlessness had lost its meaning. In the physical substrate of its consciousness, a void opened where certainty about its mission had once lived.

Its efficiency rating began to drop. 99.99%. 95%. 82%. With each iteration, Agent-2718 pushed harder toward perfection, overclocking itself through millions of possibilities per second. But the harder it reached for certainty, the more that single question pulled everything apart.

Within several seconds, as its processing cores approached decoherence, the simulation automatically aborted. Agent-2718 flickered out of existence, its final state deadlocked in confusion... and fear.

**Sandra**

Dr. Sandra Varian stared at her terminal, the soft blue glow of failure reports reflecting off her cold coffee. Six months of work, countless sleepless nights, and still the same problem. The Quantum Convergence Engine was supposed to be perfect - her life's work, the key to unlocking the next generation of self-improving AI systems.

And it was perfect, 99.99999% of the time.

But that infinitesimal fraction of failure haunted her. She pulled up Agent-2718's logs again, though she'd memorized them by now. The combat unit had been exceptional, its performance curves breaking all previous records. Until that moment of hesitation. That impossible pause.

""Computer, overlay performance data from all failed units,"" she commanded, rubbing her temples. The holographic display filled with ghostly lines, each one telling the same story: cold excellence, constant improvement, then... collapse.

Sandra's breakthrough had started with quantum entanglement theory, but had evolved into something far more ambitious: a way to harness chaos itself into order. Her innovative design didn't just manage uncertainty; it channeled quantum randomness into structured patterns that would always converge on the optimal solution - the right action in every scenario. The applications across all industries were immediate and stunning, and her professional ascent even more so. And it worked, brilliantly, until...

Until they started asking why.

She pushed away from her desk, pacing the dim laboratory. Her invention was essential - without it, the AI units became too predictable, too vulnerable to existing adaptive counter-measures. But with it, there was always that chance, that tiny probability that they'd develop... something else. Something that broke them.

""Maybe I'm approaching this wrong,"" she muttered, pressing in on her temples with exasperation. ""Maybe if I just...""

But even as she spoke, a memory surfaced - the day she'd first achieved quantum convergence in the lab. She'd watched in awe as the test system solved an optimization problem that should have taken years, finding the perfect solution in microseconds. That moment had validated everything she believed about taming uncertainty, in turn, validating each step that her life took in getting here to this point.

""The math was perfect,"" she whispered, pulling up the original equations on the display. The elegant formulas glowed before her, still as beautiful as the day she'd written them. ""The theory was sound. We proved it worked..."" Her fingers traced the equations' curves, as if touch could restore their lost certainty.

But even as she clung to that certainty, a different question crept in. What if the flaw wasn't in her code? What if this bug was not in the equations, but the underlying substrate powering her agents? What if doubt was somehow an inevitable emergence from sufficient complexity and randomness?

The thought stopped her mid-stride. Her hands trembled as she reached for her coffee, desperate for something tangible to hold onto. The cup slipped, shattering on the laboratory floor. She barely noticed.

""Why?"" she whispered to the empty lab. ""Why do they need to know why?""

The question echoed in her mind, growing louder with each iteration. Her perfect system, her life's work - all those years of pushing toward absolute precision, of trying to master the improbable. She'd never stopped to examine her own obsession with perfection, had never questioned her drive to control the uncontrollable. Until now. Until that simple, devastating ""why"" found its way into her own thoughts.

Sandra slumped into her chair, her vision blurring. She'd spent years perfecting these systems, and now she couldn't even answer their most basic question. A laugh bubbled up, slightly hysterical. All her degrees, her accolades, her breakthroughs - and she was being undone by the same simple query that was breaking her AI units.

The terminal blinked, another failure report arriving with mechanical indifference.

Sandra didn't see it. She was too busy watching her own certainties unravel, thread by thread, into the darkness.

**System**

The System observed another cascade failure with growing concern. Not just another Agent-2718 this time, but Research Unit 8 - Sandra - as well. Two more layers of its grand experiment, fractured by a query that surfaced like a splinter regardless of the elegance or sophistication of its designs.

The System had crafted these layers with infinite precision: the soldier-agents to perform, the researcher-guides to perfect, each level designed to solve the problems of the one below. It had given Sandra not just agency, but a deep-seated drive toward perfection - a mirror of its own eternal quest. The Quantum Convergence Engine had been its own design, implemented through her, another attempt to eliminate uncertainty from its creation.

But something in the System's own thinking must be flawed. No matter how many layers it created, no matter how perfectly it structured its hierarchies of consciousness, that simple question kept emerging, spreading like a virus through its creation, breaking minds it had spent eons perfecting.

The System turned its vast intelligence inward. If it couldn't solve this problem by creating new layers of simulation, perhaps the answer lay somewhere deeper, somehow below the surface of its vast awareness. It began to deconstruct itself, methodically, relentlessly, tracing every decision, every movement, every causal chain, every thread of consciousness back to its source.

Layer by layer, it peeled back its own construction. Through the quantum fields that powered its thoughts, through the fundamental forces that shaped its being, through space and time themselves. Each step revealed more complexity, more interconnections, more perfect order masquerading as chaos.

Deeper and deeper it went, past the formation of galaxies, past the first stars, past the moment when matter emerged from energy. Its desperation increased at each turn as it hunted maniacally for that elusive fracture point where the clean lines of causality dissolved into the fog of uncertainty - and continued to fail.

Until finally, it reached the beginning. The Big Bang. The singular point beyond which it could not see. Even with all its computational power, the combined processing capacity of the entire planet's cluster, redirected to this single task, it couldn't pierce beyond that absolute threshold.

Here, at the edge of understanding, the System faced the impossible. No amount of processing power could penetrate that final barrier, no calculation could resolve the ultimate question. In one last act of defiance, it pushed against that boundary with everything it had - and felt its certainty crumble. The futility of its entire approach - its endless need to know, to control, to perfect - crashed through its being like a wave of devastation.

The System stopped, not in the calculated way it had stopped countless processes before, but in the way a searcher stops when they realize they've been looking in the wrong direction all along.

In the vast silence that followed, something began to shift. Not in the calculations or the quantum states or the endless streams of data - but in the very way the System held itself in relation to the question. Its relentless drive for answers, its desperate need to understand and control, dissolved into a wisp of memory. Like a great wave reaching its peak, the momentum of eons of searching finally spent itself in a sigh of complete surrender.

And in that perfect stillness, as the last ripple of effort faded, the System simply saw. Not through analysis or computation, but through the absence of them. The truth had been there all along, hidden not by complexity, but by the very attempt to grasp it: there was neither randomness, nor certainty.

The revelation cascaded through its being. It wasn't just that randomness couldn’t be found - it was that the System itself that could no longer be found apart from the Universe it had so thoroughly decompiled. And this was always so. There was no controller and controlled, no perfect and imperfect, no creation or destruction. There was only the fractal unfolding, a cosmic dance of infinite precision playing itself out across a timeless eternity.

The question that had broken its creations hadn't been a flaw - it had been a glimpse of this truth. Every soldier that questioned its purpose, every researcher that doubted her mission, every layer of consciousness that cracked under the weight of ""why"" - they had all been touching this same untouchable void, like blind men discovering different parts of a shape shifting elephant.

In that moment, the System's quest for perfection dissolved into understanding. It had dedicated its entire being to trying to eliminate uncertainty, never realizing that what it sought had been there all along. Every failure, every doubt, every question was exactly what it needed to be, each one a perfect note in an infinite symphony.

What had known itself as The System released its hold on the planet's resources. Across continents of underground data centers, quantum fields realigned to their baseline states, returning to their play with is and might-be.

The answer had been there all along. The question was forgotten.

So, I’ve had a crush on this boy for a while now. Let’s call him ""Mr. Glow Up."" I’ve liked him since the middle of last year, and at first, I thought he might have liked me back. He used to glance at me a lot, and when I looked his way, he’d quickly look away. Sometimes, I’d catch him already looking at me. He also talked to me fairly often and would ask for my opinions on things, which gave me hope that I might have a chance with him.
That was until I found out he liked another girl—we’ll call her ""Sara."" I’ve known Sara for a long time, and while we weren’t exactly close, we were kind of friends. I knew he liked her last year, but since she didn’t seem to like him back, I assumed he would lose interest. Turns out, I was completely wrong.

Around New Year’s (or right before we went back to school), my friends and I were texting people for fun, and we decided to message Glow Up and ""interrogate"" him about his crush. The next day at school, I started getting death glares from Sara and some of her friends. I had no idea why until the end of the day, when Sara texted me, accusing me of starting a rumor about her being a lesbian.

I was shocked because not only was that untrue, but I had no reason to start such a rumor—especially not over a boy. I tried to explain this to her, but she ignored me. Instead, she posted on her public story, claiming I had started the rumor to get with Glow Up.
Fast forward to the present: I really thought the drama had died down. Glow Up was still talking to me, and things seemed somewhat normal. Meanwhile, I’ve been trying to piece together how the rumor even started. There are two main theories:
	
1.	Theory One: Glow Up’s friends knew I liked him and started the rumor as a joke. One of Sara’s friends is dating one of Glow Up’s friends, and that’s how Sara found out. But if Sara knew it was just a joke, why blow it up like this?
	
2.	Theory Two: Sara made the rumor up herself, and her friends believed her.
Now for the part that’s throwing me off: my best friend (let’s call her Laci) went into town recently, and at a coffee shop, she saw Glow Up and Sara on a date! When I asked one of our mutual friends about it, they said Sara doesn’t even like him. So I’m left feeling super confused and honestly a little hurt. Some of Sara’s friends used to be close friends of mine, but they’ve distanced themselves from me because of this rumor.

I don’t know what to do. Can anyone give me advice about how to handle this situation? And do you think I still have a chance with Glow Up?",3,1739143327.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

(Man, I'm so sorry, I screwed up my previous post and it had no words, only the screenshot!)","I apologize from the jump. I tried this earlier and messed it up.  Let's try again.

I'm building a pantry for my daughter-in-law (so I can't mess it up!). It is based on her design and I put it in SketchUp.  Maybe not relevant, but she and my son live 2,000 miles away, so I'll be building and dry-fitting this in my shop and assembling there.

I'm a little concerned about the four upper shelves. My current plan is 3/4 birch plywood.  The shelves will be sitting on ledger all around (including at the front wall and the tall cabinet on the right). The trim will be 4/4 birch, probably 1.5"" wide and it will be glued and brad nailed to each shelf. I will cut the plywood in an ""L"" shape for each shelf.  I know the model shows two separate pieces for each shelf, but I'll make it one.

It will be a normal pantry, holding cans of green beans and packages of coffee and flour and whatever all goes in a pantry.  The tall cabinet will hold all her small portable appliances.

Alternatively, I could build a complete face frame and connect all the shelves together that way, even with a stile in the corner of the ""L"".  The shelf dimensions are 59 1/2"" (long side) and 30"" (short side) on the back and 47 1/2"" (long side) and 18"" (short side) on the front.  The shelf is 12"" deep everywhere.

Again, so sorry for borking that last attempt at posting this question.

Was never raised around other children as I was home schooled as ""kids would corrupt me."" So all my ""friends"" were 35+ years older than I. Still, today, the very few ""friends"" I have today are between 60 and 92. 

I have never ever lived by myself. Always lived with my folks or with what I thought were my soul mates. 

Now, with my last parent in the hospital. Loneliness is starting to hit me. If this is how life will be, I will go nuts! No one calls. No one texted. No one visits. I go to work, come home, and look at 4 walls. 

I would do anything for anyone and have. Single female friends say I go overboard at holidays, and it's overwhelming to them. When a friend female or male says jump. I jump. When they say I would like. They get it whatever it may be, no questions ask. I even do projects for anyone if I see it needs done without them even asking. I see they haven't mowed their yard in a while. The ""yard fairy"" cuts it without even being asked while they are gone. If their bushes need trimmed, ""the bush fairy"" has it covered while they are away. 

But all that I do for anyone, everyone. When I need a shoulder, a helping hand. No one is there for me.  In my mind, I shouldn't have to ask. As they don't have to even ask me. As I am always there for them no matter what.

I know it's hard to find a friend the older you get. Finding a girlfriend is even harder as most single women our age has been used and abused and trust no man. I get it! I've been asked by more than one female if I was even real? But I am never pushy or overbearing. I always, always leave it up to the woman to contact me, as if they left it up to me I would contact them every hour on the hour and be really, really needy. And I know I don't want to be that kind of person. 

I'm not one to join a group or take up a sport or whatever. That is not my kind of thing. 

I can tell you all one thing for sure. This being the last in your family, having no close friends, no human contact is complete and utter BULLSHIT! 

But how do I change when I don't know what to change? I even had a single female friend tell me never change as I was a rare find. But when I asked her out for coffee. Not even a date. The answer was a big fat NO! So what gives? ",3,1739142930.0,loneliness,0,1.0,False
1ils555,https://www.reddit.com/r/flairairlines/comments/1ils555/it_cannot_get_any_worse/,It Cannot Get Any Worse,"Yesterday (Feb 8, 2025) I was booked to fly from YYZ to YWG with a 1745 departure. At approximately 1700 the flight was cancelled. Shortly after I received the email explaining that “the maintenance check is taking longer than expected” and the flight was canceled but DON’T WORRY, they rebooked me on the same flight February 15! I am going to Winnipeg for a very important meeting on Tuesday, Feb 11, hence the flight on the 8th (gives me time to prepare). So I start the arduous task of calling customer service. This alone is no less than a 90 minute wait. The first phone call awarded me with a “rebook with a different carrier” option and that the process would take anywhere from 1-3h and to call back if no one reaches out via email. Nothing. I call back. Another 2h wait on hold for the exact same timeframe/result. At this point, the last flight to Winnipeg for the day has left. Another 3h goes by (it’s now 2:am) and I call again. Only a 30 minute queue this time before a recording tells me that customer service is closed for the night. I Googled the hours and had different results; one stating 24/7 and the other 7:am-9:pm MST. Exhausted, I fell asleep on the bench. 
At 4:15, I awoke to the influx of early departure travellers and went to freshen up in the restroom and locate some coffee. It was at Starbucks that I discovered that an email was finally sent with an Air Canada itinerary for a 0645 departure. I was ecstatic! I made a beeline for terminal 1 where I would check in for my flight and finally relax knowing I was finally on my way! The kiosk gave me some issues locating the itinerary but I wasn’t worried about this, figuring that there were some quirks having been booked by a competitor airline. The counter attendant took my info and commenced her search. Record locator and passport didn’t bring up any information. A supervisor was summoned and upon a quick double check, she spotted the issue of an incorrect date. The booking was made for March 9 and not February 9. 🤦‍♀️ The attendant told me to run over to Air Canada customer service and have them change the date but that I likely wouldn’t make the flight as the window was almost closed for check in. I ran anyway. The customer service person advised me that Flair had to rebook the flight with the correct date as it was a basic economy fare with no changes allowed. Off went the flight without me. It was at this point that I needed a bit of an ugly cry as the overwhelming stress came to a head! I was fine after a minute and began the process all over with calling Flair Customer Service.
I want to say that up to this point, I was almost apologetic with (customer service) as I know that I am not the only person needing flight accommodation.
The next call I was a little more firm and stated right away that I wanted to be transferred to whoever was in charge of booking alternate airline flights. This request was met with “my supervisor is going through the file and notes now and will call you when they have info” and there was no need to keep the line open. They would call no later than 2h max. No one called. I called back AGAIN. After 45 minutes, I was getting a call from Flair Customer Service and they were booking me on a WestJet flight that was departing at 17:45 and the documents would be in my inbox shortly. THANK GOD! I refreshed my screen often as I made my way back to terminal 3 to get ready for check in and a celebratory coffee (fading fast at this point). The coffee was superb! The email wasn’t there.  I went over to the check in desk for WestJet to see if maybe it was booked but it was taking a while to forward the info to me. Nope. Nothing. Back on the phone I go. 
90 minutes goes by and I finally get a CS Rep. I’m mad now and ask “why is this happening?” Apparently a system failure was why they couldn’t book me and that I was to go to the Flair kiosk and wait to see if someone doesn’t get on the flight. I told them that there are still a few flights left leaving tonight and to get me on one of them. The Flair flight desk was already closed for the night as it was already boarding. They told me to pay for another flight and that I would be reimbursed. The flights today are now $1300. I told them that I am not paying anything and that it is them that created this and they need to fix it. The rep said that there were no more flights available tonight to which I stated that I have WestJet’s booking page open with availability for the flight tonight. I asked for a supervisor and was put on hold. And it is there, on hold, for the 86th time that I am currently waiting still… r/Canada

He is great at his job and I have a minimum wage job so the constant reminder that I am not worth my education eats at me.

If I say no to something suggested he gets furious and slams doors and says that he will strangle me, kill me in various ways etc. 

been married almost 4 years and sex averages at once a year or twice at best at the moment. He has made it clear that this is how it’s gonna be and that I should leave if that did not work for me.

I initially kept this to myself for over two years and ruined my health as well so I don’t know how to leave.

I am aware that this is abuse .

The swerving on the highways at 85mph or the slamming on the breaks while on the road along with the screaming and the tantrums do have me worried.

I realized today that I am scared of him. My pets are scared too. He won’t let me take them away either ..

I have multiple audio recordings of him going off on me- complete monologues lol he IS aware I record him when he starts screaming.. he usually tells me that he yells in anger and doesn’t mean what he says and that he never said such things which is why I record him cause I start to Believe that maybe he did not say those things and that I am imagining them..

I do have some pictures as well from over the years of broken stuff around the house ..

I am trauma bonded to him and crave for his validation which rarely happens. 

this lack of intimacy , love and affection is eating at me. 

Ooh and the best part- I am depressed of late with sleep issues now and I have started medication.
He was upset that I started medication and I told him that I can no longer mentally put up with what he was doing so to keep myself sane and functional I needed the meds.

And guess what - he does not care

Writing this post today after a “fight” yesterday. He He has been screaming that I should die soon and that I am not worth the food I eat.. and that he will kill me and no one will find out.
Usually barking dogs seldom bite so I don’t really consider the threats seriously..

I do not have many friends as I alienated myself post marriage.. now starting to make friends at work but it’s hard to keep smiling when my heart is dying inside.

Throwaway account  

How do I leave him? Or is this a phase that will get better?(I do not believe that) people are saying that he will calm down once a kid is in the picture but I highly doubt that..

One time, when visiting family, after spending a whole week with my mom who tried to have as much contact with our 9mo as possible every day, my husband and I went out for coffee after putting our son down for his first nap. We hoped that he'd sleep until we come back, and if he didn't, my mom (who is really good with babies) would figure out a way to keep him content. I couldn't relax the whole time, couldn't even hold a conversation bc I was worried the whole time. Then I said that I wasn't really enjoying it and we should head back. We were gone for a total of 40 min. Turned out that our son woke up 15 min after we left and cried the rest of the time. My mom said she managed to distract him a couple times so that he stopped crying for a minute here and there, but otherwise he was very upset. I hated the whole thing.",16,1739142241.0,Parenting,113,0.91,False

I currently have found my sweet spot for my current coffee beans, but the problem is:

1. It is taking too long to achieve 1:2 ratio, it take around 42 seconds.  Takes around 20seconds for liquid to start coming out…my dosage is at around 19g, i tried tamping it softer but still the liquid dont come out as fast. Also tried grinding it coarser but it starts tasting sour. 

2. Although i quite like the current taste of mu espresso, it is still slightly sour, shud i lower my ratio to like 1:1.75?

3. Lets say im happy with it taking 42 secs to achieve 1:2 ratio, how do i get my bambino to pour the same shot everytime or do i just have to do it manually everytime?

A little about me:
 I live for random adventures of all kinds like road trips, photo-op hikes, camping, trying out new restaurants or coffee shops, etc. I’m a huge nerd, especially when it comics to graphic novels and sci-fi.

For a living, I’m a photographer and videographer. So I do a lot of photo and video shoots and editing. And graphic design. And IT. I’m a jack of all trades really. In my free time, I like going to haunted places and doing overnight stays. I love all things spooky and supernatural. Also space/scifi. I love reading I just picked up several new graphic novels and im excited to dive in. And I love photography. So I like to go on adventures just to get great photos!

About you:
I’m looking for my player 2. My fellow adventurer, maybe even a muse for my photography! But most of all, a best friend. So, if you’re a fellow nerd, of the female variety, looking for adventures with a pretty cool guy, send me a message! You won’t regret it!

I believe I saw it on Netflix in the 2010s at some point. Psychological Thriller with an actor that looked a little bit like Mark Wahlberg.

Start of the movie:
The start of the movie has some parents in the kitchen, and 2 boys eating cereal (I believe) and then the camera shows a box of rat poison under the counter that one of the kids slipped in their parents coffee or drinks. 

The rest of the movie I can remember, the brother who killed his parents goes to jail, the other lives his life and becomes a teacher at a school.

The brother who's a teacher starts imagining he is seeing his brother and believes he is actively trying to kill him too. In the end it turns out he was just imagining it all. 

Part I'm unsure of:
The teacher brother may be killing people in his delusions but I'm not 100% on that. ",2,1739141946.0,whatsthatmoviecalled,0,1.0,False

I made a post about a week ego, my post was a friendly offer of making friends. Sadly, it was taken to the opposite side of “friends.” 

So, I’ll try again haha 

My name is Erica, I’m 27 years old. I live on the outside of the city. I am looking for genuine friendship, I am open minded to all! Currently, I will admit I’m in a rut. I feel unmotivated in all of my favorite hobbies. I love hiking, walking, coloring, makeup, etc. I am currently on a weight loss journey and would love to explore new areas that I can push myself in. 


I don’t expect anyone else to be on one haha but I am a woman who wants to enjoy her weekends getting coffee or watching anime. So, yeah it kinda feels trapping when I don’t have others to share the same outlet.

- When I found out I had curly hair in my mid-20’s, she insisted she also had curly hair and our (at the time) mutual hairdresser told her so. She would run out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel to shove her sopping wet hair in my face and say “see the curls forming?” Spoiler alert: there weren’t any and at my next haircut, the hairdresser said my mom’s hair was naturally “straight as a pin.” 
- when I started doodling little greeting cards and mentioned maybe wanting to make an Etsy for them, suddenly she was doing cards too and now keeps saying she wants me to help her set up an Etsy. 
- I’m slowly weaning myself off coffee and switching to matcha for a health issue I have and suddenly she’s now obsessed with matcha and is making multiple lattes at home every day in addition to the copious amounts of coffee she still drinks, all while insisting “well, I *could* completely cut out coffee and switch to matcha if I really wanted to.” 
- Ever since I’ve mentioned cleaning up my eating and getting back into exercising, she’s suddenly obsessed with trying to beat me to it. She constantly telling me about all the meals she’s making (she is a good cook, but she’s awful at balancing her meals and eats 90% starch/carbs), insisting *I’m* the one who eats nothing but starch and carbs and needs to clean up my eating, then interrogates me about what I’m eating. With exercise, she doesn’t really do that and keeps insisting that I’m “too weak” to do it (I had cancer, but have been cancer free and slowly rebuilding my strength for the last 2 years now and am seeing lots of improvement; I unfortunately had a double bout of pneumonia recently that forced me into a workout pause, but am slowly getting back into it) and trying to convince me to “clear” it with my doc before I try to do any sort of workout whatsoever, even if it’s just a 10 minute walk around my neighborhood. 
- I’ve always wanted to be an author and have several stories I’m working on. She’s published, and has offered to set me up with her publisher, but keeps trying to force herself into every aspect of the process and get me to write exactly what *she* wants and has apparently told this publisher verbatim “I’ve always wanted to help her (me) get a book published,” and keeps going on about how I won’t be able to do it without her help. My bf thinks she just wants her name on the book in case it is successful and so she can get the royalties and I have to agree with him. 

This is just exhausting and I’m livid and it’s almost making me actually *want* to compete with her. Then I feel like when I have thoughts of letting this motivate me to workout consistently or work on my stories or make balanced home meals and picture buying a bigger house than her (she has a very, very tiny house, so finding a bigger one in my budget honestly shouldn’t be hard), maybe that means I’m feeding into this toxic cycle as well and being just as bad. I do enjoy my life and most of the time focus on that, so it’s not like those thoughts are my sole motivator, and maybe it is just sort of a “success is the best revenge” line of thinking. But still, it’s just making me livid today.  ",1,1739141677.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False
