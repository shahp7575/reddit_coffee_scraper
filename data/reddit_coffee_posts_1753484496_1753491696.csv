Or tried to coast downhill, only to realize you’d forgotten to take your foot off the gas (oops)? Welcome to r/EcoDrivingEvolutionA – where we’re all about turning “I should drive more efficiently” into “Hey, I just saved a tank this month!”This isn’t a space for gearheads reciting engine specs (though if you know how to tweak a hybrid’s regenerative braking? Spill). It’s for the parent shuttling kids to soccer practice, wondering if “slow and steady” really beats weaving through traffic (spoiler: it does, and your brakes will thank you). The commuter who spends 45 minutes in stop-and-go, curious if idling less could cut their weekly fill-ups. The road-tripper who loves scenic detours but hates how “scenic” translates to “surprise gas station in the middle of nowhere with $5/gal prices.”Share your small wins: “Tried accelerating gently this week – my MPG went up 2! Also, my passengers stopped yelling ‘WHOA’ every time I hit the gas.” Ask for hacks: “How do you keep from speeding on empty highways? I set cruise control, but my foot still itches.” Laugh at the fails: “Tried ‘coasting’ to a stop sign… and rolled right past it. Neighbor saw. Now they wave and say ‘eco-warrior overshoots again!’”Eco-driving isn’t about being perfect. It’s about little tweaks: leaving 5 minutes early to avoid rush-hour jams, checking tire pressure so your car isn’t dragging like it’s wearing concrete boots, or realizing that “fast lane” often means “fuel-sucking lane.” It’s for anyone who thinks, “I can’t save the planet alone, but I can save a few bucks on gas – and that’s a start.”So grab your keys (and maybe a notepad to track MPG). Let’s swap tips, groan about gas prices, and cheer each other on as we turn our cars from fuel hogs into lean, green (or at least greener) driving machines. Here, every mile counts – even the ones where you accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake. Progress, not perfection, right?",1,1753491556.0,EcoDrivingEvolutionA,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The market for custom aluminum cups offers a wide range of options, each with unique features catering to different needs and preferences. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the best cup for your specific use case.

**Material Quality:** The quality of aluminum used in the cup significantly impacts its durability, weight, and thermal conductivity.

High-grade aluminum, such as 304 stainless steel with an aluminum coating, is often preferred for its corrosion resistance and ability to maintain beverage temperature. Thicker gauge aluminum provides better insulation and prevents dents and scratches. Some brands also offer recycled aluminum options for environmentally conscious consumers. The finish, whether powder-coated, anodized, or brushed, affects the cup's aesthetic appeal and resistance to wear and tear.

**Customization Options:** The extent and quality of customization options are critical for branding and personalization.

The best custom aluminum cups offer a variety of customization techniques, including laser engraving, screen printing, and full-color digital printing. Laser engraving provides a permanent, subtle mark, while screen printing allows for vibrant colors and complex designs. Full-color digital printing enables photo-realistic images and gradients. The size and placement of the customizable area also vary among brands, allowing for different levels of branding complexity. Look for brands that offer design assistance and proofing services to ensure your design is accurately reproduced.

**Insulation Performance:** Insulation is essential for maintaining the temperature of beverages, keeping drinks cold for extended periods and hot beverages warm.

Many custom aluminum cups feature double-walled vacuum insulation, which creates a barrier that minimizes heat transfer. This technology can keep cold drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot drinks hot for up to 12 hours. The effectiveness of the insulation depends on the quality of the vacuum seal and the thickness of the insulation layer. Some cups also include a copper lining, which further enhances thermal performance.

**Lid Design and Functionality:** The lid is an important component of the cup, affecting its usability and spill resistance.

Various lid designs are available, including screw-on lids, snap-on lids, and sliding lids. Screw-on lids provide the most secure seal, preventing spills and leaks. Snap-on lids are convenient for quick access but may not be as leak-proof. Sliding lids allow for easy sipping and often include a silicone gasket for a tighter seal. The material of the lid, typically plastic or stainless steel, also affects its durability and heat resistance.

**Size and Capacity:** The size and capacity of the cup should suit the intended use and beverage type.

Custom aluminum cups are available in a range of sizes, from small 12-ounce cups for coffee to larger 32-ounce cups for water or other beverages. The shape of the cup, whether cylindrical, tapered, or contoured, also affects its ergonomics and ease of handling. Consider the cup's dimensions and weight when choosing a size, especially if it will be used for travel or outdoor activities.

**Durability and Maintenance:** The overall durability and ease of maintenance determine the cup's longevity and usability.

Aluminum cups are generally durable and resistant to dents and scratches, but the quality of the finish and the thickness of the aluminum can affect their resistance to wear and tear. Powder-coated finishes are particularly durable and resistant to chipping and fading. Most custom aluminum cups are dishwasher safe, but hand washing is recommended to prolong the life of the finish and prevent damage to the insulation.

Key features of custom aluminum cups include:
* High-grade aluminum construction
* Double-walled vacuum insulation
* Customizable design options
* Leak-proof lid designs
* Various sizes and capacities
* Durable finishes

## Core Benefits

Custom aluminum cups offer a range of practical benefits that make them a popular choice for individuals and businesses alike.

**Enhanced Branding and Promotion:** Custom aluminum cups provide an excellent opportunity to promote your brand or message. By imprinting your logo, slogan, or artwork on the cup, you can create a memorable and lasting impression on your target audience. These cups serve as a walking billboard, increasing brand visibility and recognition.

**Eco-Friendly Alternative:** Switching to reusable aluminum cups reduces reliance on disposable plastic cups, which contribute to environmental pollution. Aluminum is a highly recyclable material, making it a sustainable choice. By using custom aluminum cups, you can demonstrate your commitment to environmental responsibility and appeal to eco-conscious consumers.

**Superior Temperature Retention:** Double-walled vacuum-insulated aluminum cups offer excellent temperature retention, keeping drinks cold for hours and hot beverages warm for an extended period. This feature is particularly beneficial for outdoor activities, travel, and daily commutes. Enjoy your favorite beverages at the perfect temperature, regardless of the environment.

**Durability and Longevity:** Aluminum cups are durable and resistant to dents, scratches, and corrosion, making them a long-lasting investment. Unlike disposable cups that are easily damaged, custom aluminum cups can withstand daily use and maintain their appearance for years. This durability translates to cost savings over time.

**Versatile Use:** Custom aluminum cups are suitable for a wide range of beverages, including water, coffee, tea, soda, and alcoholic drinks. They can be used at home, in the office, at events, and during outdoor activities. Their versatility makes them a practical and convenient choice for various occasions.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about custom aluminum cups to help you make an informed decision.

**Are custom aluminum cups safe to use with hot beverages?**

Yes, most custom aluminum cups are safe to use with hot beverages. Look for cups made from food-grade aluminum and featuring double-walled vacuum insulation, which prevents the exterior of the cup from becoming too hot to handle. However, it is always advisable to exercise caution when handling hot liquids and to avoid overfilling the cup.

**How do I clean and maintain my custom aluminum cup?**

Most custom aluminum cups are dishwasher safe, but hand washing is recommended to prolong the life of the finish and prevent damage to the insulation. Use a mild detergent and a soft sponge or cloth to clean the cup. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, which can scratch the surface. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely before storing.

**Can I customize both the cup and the lid?**

The customization options for the cup and the lid vary among brands. Some brands offer customization for both the cup and the lid, while others only allow customization for the cup. Check with the manufacturer or supplier to determine the available customization options. Common lid customization options include laser engraving and printing.

**What is the minimum order quantity for custom aluminum cups?**

The minimum order quantity (MOQ) for custom aluminum cups varies among suppliers. Some suppliers offer low MOQs, making them suitable for small businesses or personal use, while others require higher MOQs for bulk orders. It is essential to inquire about the MOQ before placing an order.

*Warning this will be a structured yet very much stream of consciousness style of writing, no AI used :)* 

I'm from New Jersey and have been around of course my state, Philly, and NYC a lot in my life but never ended up making it out to Buffalo until last week. 

So my wife and I decided to take a couples trip and had been talking about coming here to experience the original Buffalo Sauce. We ended up choosing to do 2 long haul trains to get in and out.

Our trip:

Thursday - 7/17/2025

* Train
   * Took the train from where we live into NY Penn Station
   * Took the Amtrak train from NY Penn Station to Exchange Street Station in downtown Buffalo got there around \~10:10pm 
   * Honestly was pretty cool for me loved the sight seeing while listening to music, cuddling with my wife, and doing some programming on my laptop for fun
* Hotel 
   * Made our way from the station to the Hilton Garden Inn
   * dropped off our stuff and were a bit hungry and wanted some drinks
* Later night food/ drinks
   * We looked up to see what was open and saw a looot of things were closed which was a bit interesting given it was only just past 10pm on a Thursday night. 
   * So we see this place called Streetlight Brasserie, we make our way there and they are no longer serving food and the vibe just wasn't it for us.
   * We see across the street another place that should have food and drinks House of Charm ( 517 Washington St, Buffalo, NY 14203 ) 
   * We end up going in here, it's got an amazing fucking vibe, great decoration, great bar tenders. We end up getting 2 paninis and drinks. 
   * Was really good, highly recommend
* We go to bed

Friday - 7/18

* Wake up
   * we wake up after sleeping in and want some coffee
   * just across the street is a Tim Hortons, I've heard a lot about it from Canadians over the years and have to try it
   * honestly very solid coffee for a chain store
   * And the donuts were very good for chain, i hear they used to be even better but this was really good for a chain
   * We drink our coffee and hold off on eating for a bit
* Architecture!
   * We make our way just a few blocks over to the Buffalo City Hall and take a keen eye to all of the architecture around
   * As a big fan of Art Deco and Architecture in general there is so many gorgeous fucking buildings around this area! 
   * We go inside the City Hall and the security guard was a very lovable dude making the boring process of security a little less annoying, love when people bring a bit of humanity to the less enjoyable parts of being adults.
   * I'm truly struck by the inside, the elevators, the ceilings, everything just fucking wow it's amazing. 
   * We go to the top and observe outside the windows and its stunning, but then to be in the ya very cramped outside portion of the top of the City Hall, absolutely amazing experience, what a lovely fucking experience I see why so many posts tell us out of towners to come check it out!
* Random mid day things
   * we walk around looking at buildings and eventually get a slice of pizza from JJs Casa Di Pizza ( 11 E Mohawk St, Buffalo, NY 14203 ) 
   * As a Jerseyite was a bit surprised by the thicker slice of pizza, we generally have a ""New York City"" style. It was an ok slice of pizza.
   * We walk over and take a look in Western New York Book Arts Center (right next to the pizza place) and it was a very nice little place, we ended up getting a few pieces of art there that are coffee themed to put above my Coffee Bar ( I'm a total coffee dork ) 
   * we head back to our hotel to drop the art off and take a quick rest
* Excursion up further north
   * We decide to go to Aurum Jewelers ( 487 Elmwood Ave, Buffalo, NY 14222 ) because my wife wanted to look at some of the pieces in person, we end up getting this stunning vintage ring from the Art Deco period
   * We decide to just walk around, it's pretty hot that day and so we stop at a gas station and i get a random Icee 
   * We keep walking south to find something to do, end up at Allen Street and decide to head towards Anchor Bar to try the original wings (yes i know just hold on and read). 
* The way to Anchor Bar
   * On the way I see Gabriel's Gate and tell my wife this is the one many of the people in this subreddit say is the best 
   * We stop into this Art showcase called American Popaganda ( 93 Allen St, Buffalo, NY 14202 ) , was really cool and the curator was very kind
   * We then stop into this place called ""Ms Eye Candy Boutique ( 85 Allen St, Buffalo, NY 14202 ) and I end up getting this really cool shirt, that's supposed to be for women but it happens to fit on me and fits my vibe really well
   * while here we talk with the owner and a local who came in about us being from out of town and they were a lot like a lot of y'all who were saying don't go to Anchor Bar, mentioning ask for ""extra crispy"", as well as just talking about things around Buffalo
* Anchor bar (please hold off from writing before reading! :P locals)
   * We walk in and grab a seat
   * We just get waters, a 10 piece Medium (the original sauce) and an appetizer platter
   * The appetizers were actually really solid, the tomato sauce whatever it was for dipping was very flavorful, quality Tomatoes were used in that base, as a Jersey boy who's consumed an unhealthy amount of Tomato based sauces, it was good.
   * We finish the appetizers and it's time
   * Now here's the thing, I know the locals kept saying ""extra crispy"" which my wife and I felt was a notable thing to say, because the reason we were coming to Buffalo in the first place was the Sauce, and we are thinking the Sauce. So when they were saying there is better but mention the texture of the wings we found that a bit odd. My wife and I are very much foodies, absolute unabashed Live to eat type people. We also particularly are just fans of sauces, whether it's a good Jersey style Vodka sauce, a Buffalo Sauce, a creamy Pesto, etc. doesn't matter we just love a good sauce. My wife always says ""food is just a vessel for sauce"" which in this case that was our main thing we wanted
   * So we have it, and my god easily the best Buffalo Sauce we've ever had. Such a perfect balance in it between the Vinegar, Butter, and the pure Hot Sauce. And it was such a stable perfect consistency even with that noted butteriness, truly a work of fucking art. And y'all can tell me it's not the best in the city and sure it may not be but that sauce fucking slapped. I am a slut for shoveling buffalo sauce in my face, and that was the best I have had its like fucking candy.
   * Ok ya so that was amazing
* Home and relaxing
   * We decide to head home after a long day of doing so many random things
   * First we grab 2 bottles of the ""medium"" AKA original 

Saturday 7/19

* We wake up and want to get coffee
   * Why is the Tim Hortons I mentioned right near our hotel not open on Saturday or Sundays?
   * End up going to Public Espresso ( 391 Washington St, Buffalo, NY 14203 ) which is a very good vibe in there and damn good coffee for a coffee dork like myself
   * And we really don't do too much for a while as my wife was very tired from a long day of doing a ton of stuff so we just hang out with eachother for a while
* OSB Ciderworks & Melting Pot
   * We end up eventually deciding to head out and end up at OSB Ciderworks ( 517 Main St, Buffalo, NY 14203 ) 
   * This was probably the 2nd best Ciders I've had before, only being beaten by a place back in my wifes home state of Colorado called The Old Mine ( 500 Briggs St, Erie, CO 80516 ). Seriously If you ever happen to find yourself anywhere near this, go there and try some of their ciders it's sooooo good
   * afterwards my wife mentions having Fondue so we head over to Melting Pot ( Galleria Mall, 1 Walden Galleria Suite D224, Buffalo, NY 14225 ) a chain and it was amazing and we get very tipsy from it
   * We end up walking around the mall a bit and of course end up in Lush as we always do.
   * Head home and just spend a chill night back in the hotel

Sunday 7/20

* We get coffee from Public Espresso again 
   * Again why isn't Tim Hortons open? just odd really.
* We make our way to the AKG Art Museum
   * Honestly just fucking fantastic experience seeing all these different pieces, many very famous and many different styles truly wonderful.
   * I don't really know what to say that hasn't been said about many of these pieces though I do want to note that I did really enjoy in one area the 4 benches piece with writing on it, almost missed it but very much enjoyed that piece.
* OSB Ciderworks again
   * We head back into our little area of Buffalo we've been and wanted more Cider
   * We get there and we end up just getting really tipsy and yapping for a long time with the Bartender she was great and was super fun to talk to 
   * Overwinter Coffee - Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur was insanely good. wow
   * Seriously was just really fun talking about stuff and drinking
   * we then head out to eat and end up going to Bada Bing ( 42 W Chippewa St, Buffalo, NY 14202 ) and get dinner and a few more drinks there 
   * Head back to our hotel and just vibe enjoying our time off

Monday 7/21

* Heading home
   * We wake up get out stuff together and check out of the hotel 
   * End up getting Tim Hortons and head to train station
   * on the way we end up seeing this college right next to Sahlen Field right off Swan Street, and holy shit that building was gorgeous
   * And we get to the train station
* Goodbye Buffalo

  
Honestly very fun trip, Buffalo is an interesting place. For my point of comparison it's a like cleaner Philly w/ more of the historical buildings but less people walking around it seems. Oh also it being cooler than where I live was a major fucking plus, the lower humidity and lower temperatures w/ breezes was great and not too much City stank. Very weird in a good way type of place where a lot of y'all locals seem like a cross between us NYC/ NJ abrasive type motherfuckers and the Canadian super nice stereotype. 

Had a great time, thanks for anyone who managed to read this barely intelligible rambling (woulda been a bit better structured if I could go multiple deep in bullet points :P ) lmao",10,1753490707.0,Buffalo,3,1.0,False

As a Tesla owner and streaming enthusiast, I was frustrated by the limitations of getting third party full-screen streaming in my car without jumping through hoops or dealing with ads. So, I created [**IdleFlix.com**](http://IdleFlix.com)**, a completely free, adfree web tool designed to make streaming on your Tesla’s browser a breeze. It’s packed with features to make it your own, and I’m stoked to share it with the community!**

* **Add Your Own Links or Streaming Services:** IdleFlix comes with default links to popular services like Plex, ESPN, YouTube TV, Fubo, Pluto, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and even Tesla Games. But the real magic is you can add any link you want, whether it’s your favorite streaming platform, a niche service, or even a personal media server. Just pop in the name and URL, and it’s added to your grid instantly (ordered by last used, so your favorite app is always first).
* **Local Storage for Settings (No Accounts Needed)**: All your customizations including background color, added links, and even your recently used services, are saved right in your browser’s local storage. No need to create an account or log in. Your Tesla’s browser keeps everything ready for you next time you hop in. Plus, there’s a “Reset All” option if you want a fresh start. *Why I added this: I hate being forced to sign up for stuff, and local storage keeps things private and hassle-free while ensuring your setup is always there.*
* **Custom Background Colors:** You can personalize the look of IdleFlix with a color picker that lets you choose from a range of colors (like Dark Navy, Deep Teal, or Amber Glow). The background uses a smooth gradient, want a moody purple or a crisp blue? Just click and pick.
* **Future Proof:** There is no custom images here, the website pulls existing Favicons or Open Graph images so if your favorite service ever changes their logo or design language the site will automatically adapt

How It Works

1. Open your Tesla’s browser and navigate to [IdleFlix.com](http://IdleFlix.com)
2. Click the grid of streaming services to jump straight to full-screen viewing.
3. Customize the background color using the “Pick Color” button in the bottom-left corner.
4. Add your own links via the “Add Link” button in the bottom-right corner.
5. Your settings are auto-saved in the browser, so it’s ready to go next time you’re parked and ready to binge.

There’s also a “Buy me a coffee” button if you want to support the project, but it’s totally optional, IdleFlix will always be free and adfree.

Let Me Hear Your Thoughts! What do you think of IdleFlix? I am always happy to add any changes or fixes if anyone encounters issues.",1,1753490639.0,TeslaLounge,1,0.67,False

Thought it was prob a scam, but one day I was bored and tried one for a $100 Starbucks gift card (just coz I live the breakfast there). The survey took like 15-20 mins, felt like it would never end tbh. But to my surprise, I actually got a code that and when I tested it, it WORKED like, it was a real $100 I can spend on Starbucks. I used it up pretty fast, and then I started thinking... what if I do the same survey AGAIN but just change up the info (new email, fake name, temp number, etc). So I tried it again and it WORKED I got a brand new code. In the past two weeks I’ve gotten 3 Starbucks gift cards for $100 each. At this point, I get Starbucks for breakfast every day, drink like 3 lattes daily and I don’t even like coffee js the breakfasts but I'm just doing it coz its free. So whenever I’ve got a bunch of free time, I just do it again. Not sure if this is a glitch or how long it’ll last, but has anyone else tried this or done something similar?",0,1753490599.0,povertyfinance,2,0.43,False

I currently live in the midwest near a city where it is HOTTT and I cannot stand the heat. Here are some of my ideal preferences in a city, which doesn't have to be a major city either.

1. Nice nature scenes nearby/outdoor recreational areas

2. Relatively safe (I know every city has it's bad spots) but esp. since I'm a woman who runs/walks outside a lot. 

3. Mostly cool weather! Summer I'm okay with a little more heat but over 80F is not ideal. I also don't mind the rain. 

4. Left leaning, but I'm not too deep into politics

5. Sustainability!

6. Young people my age (20s, looking to meet friends and also potential male partners!)

7. Good community + events to attend

8. Good theatre/music scene/museums/history (I'm not too big on drinking and the bar scene or drugs or anything lol.)

9. Average cost of living (which I know may be hard, but I'm willing to live frugally) 

10. Yummy food!

11. Diversity

12. Good coffee and a nice farmer's market too. 

13. Good career prospects esp. for my major (chemE who wants to work in food or pharma R&D)",2,1753490583.0,SameGrassButGreener,2,1.0,False

I am M(27) and I have female coworker who I met like 1 and half month back. We casually started talking and got to a stage where we talk everyday for the last three weeks. We take lunch together, meet up for coffee after work, go home together almost 4 days a week.

We also meet on Weekends whenever we both are free. We’ve already been to dinners, bowling and mini-golf alone and she’s pitching in more places to go. I am into her and I genuinely like her a lot. I didn’t flirt with her in the beginning but started doing it to see how she reacts. I started telling her she looks pretty and cute every now and then and she replies with ‘Oh! Please stop’ and ‘You’re mad’ in a funny way.

The thing is she got another job in another state and she’s leaving in 10 days. Before that I kinda want to tell her that I am into her and don’t just see her as a friend. I don’t know how she see me and kinda don’t want to ruin this if she just looks at me as a friend. The reason why I am thinking like this is she doesn’t know anyone in this city as she recently moved here and it got me thinking whether she’s hanging out with me as she doesn’t have other friends

1m9fu68,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1m9fu68/i_love_my_sister_so_much/,I love my sister so much,"My sister and I really hated each other when we were young. The hate was stronger on her part. She used to have anger issues, and I just knew how to piss her off. We’d bond over certain weird things, like pretending using a British accent at a coffee shop… but most of the times, we fight to the point that it gets physical. My parents were hopeless. My mother thought she failed at parenting us. She was close with her siblings, so she felt like she had failed my sister and I. She always used to tell us that when she dies, my sister and I would become strangers.

The day that our mother died came… Since then, we lived together. My sister gave birth and I took care of her baby so she could work. She was a single mom. We lived with barely anything since our mom’s death drained us financially. My sister had to step up for the entire family. It was hard, and our dad didn’t want to help her. We would still have fights, but they became emotional fights. Life just put us through so much loss at a young age that sometimes it was hard for understand each other. But like all siblings in the world, we make up as if nothing had happened.

I just realized that she had always celebrated my birthday, when everyone else couldn’t. At my mother’s funeral, she bought me a birthday cake and had everyone sing me a song. Nobody cared but her. The next birthdays after that, she spent on me.

Like she promised, she pays for my education. She became my mother figure. My emergency contact. I go home to her. We cry for each other and take care of each other’s mental health. Just recently, she referred her therapist to me because she wants us both to get better together.

Love shows in the most subtle ways. I don’t think we have ever said “I love you” to each other. We don’t even hug. There are times where we can’t be there for each other. There would be times where I start to feel entitled, feeling tampo when I couldn’t get help that I need. But that irrational feeling disappears later on and I apologize to her. She always forgives. She gives me so much room for mistakes. She doesn’t even mind if I fail in school.

She doesn’t hear it from me but I would do anything for her too.",2,1753490409.0,CasualPH,0,0.75,False

I figured it was probably a scam, but I got bored one day and tried one website for a $100 Starbucks gift card. The survey took like 15–20 minutes, felt like forever honestly. But to my surprise, I actually got a code that WORKED it was legit $100. I used it up pretty quickly, and then I started wondering what would happen if I did the same survey again but with different info (like a new email, fake name, temp phone number, etc). I tried it, and it worked again. In the last two weeks I’ve gotten three $100 Starbucks cards from this, my daily breakfast is Starbucks, I drink like 3 Latte's a day now and I don't even rlly like coffee its js free at this point. So now whenever I’ve got a LOT of spare time, I just do it again. Not sure if it’s a glitch and when this will be fixed, but has anyone else come across this or done this w something else?",1,1753490146.0,beermoneyglobal,1,1.0,False

A Head Above the Past - Chapter 1:

It was another day, full of mindnumbing clacks of cheap keyboards, yellow fluorescent overhead lights singing a low buzzing hum that could drive anyone insane, and coworkers likable enough to make you want to punch them.

A grim reality not many would want to live. Unfortunately for Jane, that was exactly what her existence was. Long boring hours, morning fights over the coffee machine and water fountain small talk so dull it couldn’t cut butter.

Jane had grown used to such atmosphere, spirit may be immortal, but it can rust and stagnate. Jane had learned that long ago, her dreams of a creative job had long vanished and the desire for thrill gone.

Now it was just paper after paper after paper after paper. Get a form, fill the form and pass it on to be filled further. Get called in by your boss and yelled at because his ego got hurt.

Oh poor Jane, an office nobody with no family, no real friends and a drag job. Only 23 and already broken by life. Its rather hard not to take pity, but she swore with her entire soul she’d wave this place goodbye soon enough.

I don't live in an area with a high Jewish population, and the rise in antisemitism online (even on dating sites) and within the industry I work in has been palpable, and has made me that much more aware of the fact that I have been on my own for so long.

I was raised conservative, and even though I still say the Shema every morning, I'm not overly religious. I am very well-versed in the Tanakh from a historical perspective, though, and feel very strongly connected to my Judaism from a cultural standpoint...which is rough where I live with no one to talk to about it, especially with international affairs being what they are.

I am a scientist, historian, and educator by training, but after years of dealing with medical issues I have likely missed my window to work in those fields (since they can hire younger and less independent thinkers on the cheap). By twist of fate, my lifelong hobby is now my career as a published tabletop roleplaying game author. I also host these games online with friends and local community members.

Perhaps that's another reason I'm going out on this unusual limb. I find writing inspiration in almost every conversation I have, every joke I hear, and every new fact I learn (recent deep dives: ancient harvest festivals (including Sukkot), the history of carbonated water, artillery ammunition, and the poetic structure of the Book of Psalms). Maybe if the stars align and the right person comes along, I'll be wrapped up in them instead. If you message me, tell me what interests you right now?

I am a relatively new California inhabitant and an even newer SF citizen. I love the views, friendliness, accessibility, and beauty of this city -- but holy shit, the problems stack up. I live in a really nice neighborhood and the most intimidating place I've spent any time is in lower nob hill, where my job is. 

It's just such a bummer -- this place could be so insanely wonderful, but being chased at the bus stop by a mentally ill man was pretty horrifying. Having numerous people just stand and watch was also sobering; is it that common? I work in a major hospital system down here so I know that it's a much bigger percentage of the population than many would think, but damn. Getting chased outside is much different than calling a code gray on someone violent in a hospital room.

They often send me to the city and as much as I hate the city/traffic, it helps keep me focused more and provides great stimulation for everything I have to watch out for.  

I sleep 8-10 hrs, try to eat healthy, feel well-rested before every trip.

The one solution is I don’t do back to back trips anymore and make sure I rest for a couple hours before the next trip. I also make sure I take short trips - total there and back 7 hours in length. I also do rests before the return trip.

Why does every McD's have their industrial coffee maker set to 150 degrees? Who the hell drinks coffee at that temperature?

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very much new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure’s. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna’ herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou’ shouted out to Jenna’ saying to her

“Hey Jenna’ don’t let those boys show you up today” 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna’ just before Jenna’ set off riding her bike into the day, Lou a 63 year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna’ had met. With Lou’ being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna’ all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou’ himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna’ sat there she would often think about Hector’ thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine, 

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna’ as Jenna’ would often find herself leaning up against Hector’ as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna’ sat there thinking back on her and Hector’ setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna’ would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna’ enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very much new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure’s. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna’ herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou’ shouted out to Jenna’ saying to her

“Hey Jenna’ don’t let those boys show you up today” 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna’ just before Jenna’ set off riding her bike into the day, Lou a sixty three year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna’ had met. With Lou’ being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna’ all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou’ himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. Often finding himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna’ sat there she would often think about Hector’ thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine, 

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna’ as Jenna’ would often find herself leaning up against Hector’ as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna’ sat there thinking back on her and Hector’ setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna’ would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna’ enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

1m9f6xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m9f6xb/how_much_is_a_hot_air_balloon_ride_in_cappadocia/,How much is a hot air balloon ride in Cappadocia?,"I just got back from an incredible hot air balloon ride in Cappadocia, Turkey, and I want to share my experience and break down the costs for anyone thinking about taking this bucket-list adventure.

The short answer: Hot air balloon rides in Cappadocia typically cost between $90-200 per person, depending on the season and company you choose. After extensive research and experiencing it myself, I found a fantastic deal for $94 through Cappadocia Discovery Balloons (I'll share the booking link below).

What surprised me most was how much value you actually get for the price. The experience isn't just a simple balloon ride - it's a complete 3-hour adventure that includes:

- Hotel pickup before sunrise (they grabbed me right from my cave hotel in Göreme)
- Light breakfast and coffee while watching the balloons being inflated
- 1-hour flight over the surreal landscape
- Champagne celebration after landing
- Professional photos
- Flight certificate
- Return transport to your hotel

The flight itself was breathtaking. We floated up to 2,000 feet above the famous fairy chimneys and rock formations. Our pilot was incredibly skilled, maneuvering close enough to the rock formations for amazing photos while keeping everyone feeling completely safe.

Important things to know before booking:

1. Book in advance - spots fill up quickly, especially during peak season (April-October)
2. Weather can affect flights - have a backup day if possible
3. The experience starts early (pickup around 4:30-5:00 AM)
4. Dress in layers - mornings can be chilly
5. Not recommended for pregnant women or children under 6

After trying several companies, I highly recommend booking through this link: https://athometouch.com/cappadocia

They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later. The company has over 4,000 five-star reviews, which definitely helped me feel confident in my choice.

One final tip: If you're price-conscious, try booking for shoulder season (March-April or October-November). The views are still spectacular, but prices tend to be lower.

Looking back, even if I had paid double, it would have been worth it. The experience of floating over this otherworldly landscape as the sun rises is simply unforgettable.

Feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments - I'm happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1753488589.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

You'll have to forgive me, I over-slept today... so if you missed out on reading today's review with your coffee, I'm sorry! I must have needed the rest...

But there's no time to wait, spice bags need my attention. I can't wait to cross the finish line with you all. Something must be planned eh? More details on the final flurry soon. But let's dive straight in to what I found in the suburb of Balmain this week.

# -------------------------------------------------

# Round 25 : Wok Flavour, Balmain

([https://maps.app.goo.gl/wVJQ2iUG4pUXbf2T7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wVJQ2iUG4pUXbf2T7))

*Wok Flavor is a quiet, suburban Chinese takeout and mini-restaurant tucked away off the main drag in Balmain near residential apartment blocks. They are closed on Mondays and serve dinner and takeout 6 days a week.*

[\\""Spice bag\\"": Wok Flavour](https://preview.redd.it/y9vr5ys1y3ff1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=febfd0dea220aea90b9ff8247e1eb6c42b6e0d31)

**Cost**: **$28+ per portion. WITH NO SAUCE. With Sauce $30+** 

**Value For Money** \- ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5): Well would you look at that - the first one star of this series for value. A lovely amount of presentation does not disguise for $28 you are getting a light portion compared to most shops. [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/foodies_sydney/comments/1m3hoc3/sydney_spice_bag_quest_round_24_molly_malones/) I couldn't conceal my disdain for not getting sauce with the meal, and many of you shared my outrage. I didn't expect it to happen twice. 

A spice bag isn't a spice bag without sauce, so shops **should not** advertise it as such if they don't include it. Call it a chicken & chips meal! While some call for disqualification, I've travelled all the way and I'm going to follow through the review. I was unable to ascertain precisely how much extra  charge for the sauce was as it was a group meal and my friend paid without getting the itemized bill I requested. But napkin math after showed it must have been hefty. Very poor form.

 **Venue Ambience** \- ★★☆☆☆ (2/5): The shop was coooold when we dined-in of an evening. Not a place really that wants you to stay and linger, everyone else was just getting takeout. They made effort with the place-settings but the whole setup was a bit plain-jane. Some nice music interrupted constantly by the pinging and ringing of app-delivery order notifications.

**Service** \- ★★★★☆ (4/5): For all the criticism, I want to say and make clear the owner was very friendly and welcoming towards us. Mostly they seemed surprised that we'd gone to the trouble of using the online booking system and had travelled across the city to visit and dine-in. But friendly, keen, good people.

[Wok Flavour: Interior](https://preview.redd.it/9y3n0bkvz3ff1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=75136bc38f98283e9700497666d7791210221e50)

**Chips** \- ★★★☆☆ (3/5): A very nice amount of spice and seasoning, but overcome by a bit of greasiness and still just a basic chippy. Thankfully hot considering how cold a night it was!

**Chicken** \- ★★★☆☆ (3/5): Succulent chicken with a nice crisp cornflour batter coating. Not greasy feeling, but indulgent enough. Again lingering with a decent whack of spice and chillies, but there should have been more for the price.

**Curry Sauce** \- ★★★☆☆ (3/5): Once I asked for the sauce, what arrived was a bowl of coconut sauce that was unusual for the typical spice bag, but enjoyable. Rather than tomato-sweetness of the traditional Irish curry sauce, this had a slight coconut taste and a good texture but didn't quite have the body to cling to the chicken. Definitely an Asian twist.

# Final Score: 16 / 30

My parting comment I want to say, while this is a dreadful placement for a spice bag, I had some truly wonderful entrees and my friends had some good mains. I think the owner has heart and I wish them the best. But please, for $28 save the heartache and include some sauce!

1m9f6su,https://montreal.citynews.ca/video/2025/07/25/montreals-trashy-lady-picks-up-garbage-to-fundraise-for-the-spca/,Thanks to y’all my Trashy Lady fundraising project in MTL reached the news! 🥹 THANK YOU,"Howdy folks,

I am the Trashy Lady 🗑️👠

Someone here earlier saw me at the park and took a photo and somehow by the mystery of the internet it ended up reaching the news!

I have a lot of thoughts about garbage collection in our city after being out there so much and I thought I’d share them with y’all nice internet strangers since they didn’t include my full rant in the interview.

Here goes my verbal vomit:

It’s easy to say people are just tossing their trash out the window like it’s the 80s (I used to think the same tbh), but I really think the issue with trash in MtL is a bit more nuanced than that.

Honestly, I HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN someone straight-up littering on purpose (except for cigarettes butts 😭)

What I DO see is a a garbage system held together by « vibes » and flimsy plastic bags.

In many parts of Montreal, the city doesn’t require buildings to use solid bins on garbage day; have you noticed that?

So what happens next?

Well, people put their cutesy lil trash in flimsy lil bags that tear real easy; which is super yummy for the squirrels, raccoons, and other street critters who like to rip the bags open to wolf down whatever  left overs are in there 👹.

By the time the garbage truck arrives, it’s basically smashing open a trash piñata. 

There are bits of plastic and mystery stuff flying everywhere over the streets.

Paradoxically, it’s the time just AFTER the garbage truck has passed, that the streets are the nastiest 🤢.

And it’s not just the animals. 


As they pointed out in the interview, people  experiencing homelessness, just trying to find a few cans to survive, also rip open recycling bags. Same result. Another episode of late-stage-capitalism trash Piñata….

Of course, all of this still ties back to the root issue we don’t like talking about: our society´s little love affair with single-use plastic 🫠.

It’s cheap. It’s convenient. It’s literally everywhere. EVERYWHERE. (They have found microplastics in human breast milk! )

But I tell ya, after picking the 176th plastic coffee cap out of the street , you start to think reeeeeeeeeeal hard before grabbing that iced coffee to-go.

So yeah. It’s not about “bad people littering.” It’s a systemic problem.

Society, policy, economy; everything is involved.

P.S; But also yeah, there are people who just like to play jenga on city trash bins, adding to the problem when they can clearly see the trash can is already overflowing 🥲

1m9f56n,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1m9f56n/when_to_start_shot_timer/,When to start shot timer?,"Hi All,

I finally pulled my first couple shots on [this machine that I posted about a couple months ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1l52p3j/look_what_i_found_on_the_free_table/) This is after a thorough cleaning of the group head, replacing the gasket with a new silicone one, replacing the dispersion plate with [a new stainless one](https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/pre-2018/gaggia-classic-pro---stainless-steel-dispersion-plate-shower-screen-holder-oem-58mmx145mm) from Shades of Coffee, and installing [a Classic Pro steam wand](https://www.wholelattelove.com/collections/steam-wands-and-parts/products/gaggia-classic-pro-full-steam-wand-assembly) from WLL. I also put in a grounded 3-prong socket and added grounding wire. This is all prep for the GaggiaMate mod I'll do later this summer.

With these basic fixes in place I took it out for a first spin today. I used a Normcore bottomless portafilter and the shots looked good and tasted okay.

Question - with this machine, do you normally start timing the shot the moment the pump is turned on, or after the first drip hits the cup?

On the first shot I used my scale auto timer which didn't start until the first flow and the shot seemed to time fast - 15 secs for 36ml (18gm in) But this isn't counting the pre-infusion time.

On the second shot I manually started the scale with the pump and the numbers seemed more reasonable - 35 seconds for 36ml out.

What's stand practice for when the timer starts? I still have a lot to learn about this thing!

1m9f4wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1m9f4wg/italy_killed_my_dream_of_becoming_a_screenwriter/,Italy killed my dream of becoming a screenwriter,"Hi everyone!
This is my first post here. I thought long and hard about whether I should write it, and in the end, I decided to share the frustration of an aspiring screenwriter from a different point of view: the Italian one.

Yes, I’m Italian. But I’ve always watched only American and international cinema, with very few exceptions. That’s because my parents aren’t Italian. They’re originally from South America but grew up watching American films and TV shows. So, when they moved to Italy, they kept watching THAT kind of cinema—and passed the passion down to me.

When I was three and a half, I went to the movie theater for the first time: Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man. I remember every single moment of that day. It literally changed my life.
I grew up devouring VHS tapes and DVDs: Disney classics, the Batman films from Burton to Nolan, Reeve’s Superman, Raimi’s Spider-Man, LOTR, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean. Then came Robin Williams films, Mission: Impossible, Rocky. The older I got, the more refined my cinematic culture became, and the deeper my obsession with film grew. I started watching literally EVERYTHING, catching up on masterpiece after masterpiece of American cinema. I also discovered all the ""genre films,"" as they’re called here in Italy. In fact, my greatest love—cinematically speaking—is big, bold, popular cinema. That’s what made me fall in love with this art form, and it still feels like a safe haven to me.

You might be wondering why I’m telling you all this. The answer is simple: at some point in my life, I decided I wanted to become a screenwriter. But the problem is: in my country, with very few and often failed exceptions, there is simply no room for someone like me—someone who dreams of making your kind of movies. And by that I don’t mean $200 million blockbusters. I mean your cinema in general: thrillers, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, action, adventure, musicals, and so on. All of this... doesn’t exist in Italy today.

Here, what we mostly produce are heavy sentimental dramas or crude, meaningless comedies, usually set in small provincial towns where characters speak in dialect and are played by people who are often not even real actors. Directors lack the technical knowledge international ones have, most movies are shot with an incredibly “TV-like” style, and cinematography is often overexposed and flat, like something you’d see on a trashy afternoon talk show. You know The Bold and the Beautiful? Yeah, that’s pretty much the level here. In some productions, it’s even worse. So much so that we actually have a cult series here called Boris, which is set on the production of an Italian soap opera and mocks the whole way cinema and TV are made in this country.

Anything that doesn’t fall into that “comedy with non-actors shot like a pasta commercial” category gets labeled as arthouse in the most negative sense of the word: no action, no tension, no plot-driven structure. Just depressed characters sitting on benches in tiny villages, or staring out of windows overlooking rustic landscapes, talking endlessly.

As I said, sometimes there are exceptions: Gabriele Mainetti, for instance, has tried to revive genre cinema with films inspired by American superhero and fantasy movies, as well as Chinese action. Stefano Sollima (Soldado) and Matteo Garrone are also directors who’ve tried to fight our rotten system.

And here’s the point: our system doesn’t speak to or aim for an international audience. It simply doesn’t care. Italy might be the only country that doesn’t: Germany, France, South Korea, Japan, the UK, Spain, Argentina, and many others all produce films and series designed to appeal internationally. And to do that, you need to meet certain quality standards—standards that, sadly, most of our productions don’t even come close to.

It’s not about budget. Great films can absolutely be made on a tight budget. The real issue is that, at some point, we decided to stop funding genre projects entirely, focusing only on comedy or hollow, pretentious arthouse dramas.
Our film industry is mostly publicly funded—yes, practically “state-run.” And the funding goes only to projects that check certain boxes, including being set in specific Italian regions. Every region (think of them like U.S. states) has its own film commission, and if you want money, you have to submit your script through a public application. The ones that highlight local places and dialects are the ones that get funded. That’s why our cinema remains deeply provincial. And since most projects are self-funded through these systems, there’s no real obsession with box office results. You might think, “Well, that’s not such a bad thing.” But it is, because this self-sustaining model kills cinema. It reinforces one way of making films and discourages anything that strays from the formula.

So, “Mafia, pizza, and mandolin” isn’t just a stereotype—it’s our sad reality. And there’s another word you should add to that list: connections. Because here, unless you’re connected—unless someone vouches for you—you won’t even be allowed to serve coffee on set. You need a friend who says your name to someone who might, if they feel like it, let you step on set, probably unpaid or for pennies. Without someone opening the door for you, working in the Italian film industry is virtually impossible. And sadly, that applies to many other sectors too.

Let me give you an example to help you understand better. Let’s say Ocean’s Eleven had never been made. I’m holding the exact same script in my hands and I submit it to a film commission or a production company in Italy. Well, the movie would NEVER get made. In fact, I’d probably be mocked or ridiculed by some old-school producer or committee member. The same would happen if I submitted Oppenheimer, Se7en, Mystic River, The Departed, Million Dollar Baby, or pretty much any other major film made in the last 40 years.

I’m saying all this because, after years of trying, I’m truly exhausted. Years of doors slammed in my face, of being laughed at, of hearing “you should probably find another job” (and in fact, I work in a completely different field, or I’d starve), or “go to another country” (easier said than done when you come from a humble family and work an unstable job). I’ve managed to do a few small jobs in the industry, always hoping that one day a producer, director, or someone would finally give one of my projects a shot—or at least read my work. But nothing. In the end, they won. They crushed my dream of writing the kind of films I loved since childhood—the films that inspired me.

This whole rant—probably a bit chaotic—is simply meant to say this: while it’s hard everywhere to make our dreams come true, there are people who aren’t even allowed to dream. That might sound like an exaggeration, but I promise you, for many of us, it’s the truth. So to those of you who can still try, don’t stop writing. And as long as life gives you the chance—hold on.

Good luck to all of you, from a former aspiring screenwriter.

What she didn't know was that after she told me that, I reached out to her boss Chris Baca to see if he could make some magic happen and what ended up happening was pretty much the most magical day ever

My daughter knew we were going to the academia but she thought we were just on the public tour but instead we got a guided private tour including an amazing lunch prepared by the in-house chefs, and they even let her get on bar and pull some shots. After lunch Fatima (our tour guide) met us in Florence and took us on a three hour guided coffee tour to all the best spots in Florence, if that wasn't enough after that we went out to one of their favorite restaurants (Cibreo)  for dinner w Serena (head of hopsitality)

All of this happened on the day before her 8 year anniversary of starting in Coffee. It was a truly magical and unforgettable day. Everything was perfect, and it was so amazing to not only learn everything about the company's history, but also to experience this level of service

Big thanks to everyone at La Marzocco and Accademia Del Cafe and of course Chris Baca for making this happen :)

Midway through, I realized this one’s a little too long and a little too ridiculous to just be a reply. So here it is...

I was on my way to a date. Didn’t want to be that guy who shows up late. If she got there before me, I’d feel bad for making her wait. So I left early, took the bus, and was texting her on Snapchat.

She had asked for my Snap a few hours earlier, and I shared my handle (this becomes important later). Right after she added me, she started sending snaps of her dress. Nothing explicit, just teasing and playful 🤭. That continued through the ride, and I almost missed my stop at Church Street in the middle of our chit-chat.

Walked to Third Wave Coffee, went in, and booked a seat, and she kept texting me till she reached outside.

I went out to meet her. She showed up in this cute dress, looks great and really nailed the look 😍. I suddenly felt a bit underwhelming next to her; I was just in my usual casuals (yep, my fashion sense is bad), nothing special.

Me: Hi.  
Her: Hi.  
Me: Let’s get inside?  
Her: Wait a minute! I want to tell you something.  
Me: Yeah…? (wondering what’s up)  
Her: You’re an Aries, right?  
Me: Yes…? (confused)  
Her: I’m a Sagittarius.  
Me: So…??  
Her: We’re both fire signs. We’ll be too good for each other.  
Me: !?  (huh)  
Her: We’ll fight constantly…  
Me: Uhhhmm... I don’t know what to say.  
Her: I’m sorry.  
Me: Okay… (still processing wtf is happening)  
Her: I’m gonna go. Sorry again.  
Me: Wait… since you’re already here, why not at least have a coffee, talk a bit and then leave?  
Her: Thanks, but it’s okay. I’m leaving. (She turned and waved.)  
Me: Okayy… then… bye. (I waved back.)

Went back inside, ordered myself a hot chocolate and chocolate croissant.  
I needed that sugar and caffeine to ksheenam maataanum and enthaappo ndaayenn process cheyyaanum 😅

I guess she saw my Aries sign in my Snap bio after adding me. If that was the deal breaker, she could’ve just told me before leaving her place. But still... she came all the way, dressed up, just to tell me that and then dipped.

Honestly? Respect to her for not standing me up.

Never believed in astrology, horoscope or that zodiac sign shyt.  
Didn’t think you could get rejected by the universe.  
Turns out, even if you don’t believe in it, if the other person does, you’re still getting fc\*ked by the stars. 😆😆",2,1753488034.0,twentieskerala,0,1.0,False

1:12, 30g coffee:360g water, 91c
Finer than avg grind (17 on encore)

- Closed Switch, “bloom” pour on divotted bean bed, fast pour to 260
- Aggressive stirring, 2:30 steep, open Switch
- Open Switch pour, to 360, stir, enjoy

Came out definitely sweeter than normal, but the texture was obviously enhanced with the stronger ratio. Will definitely try again on a non-co-ferment.

It often moves things (when no one is looking-pocket knives seem to be the most popular, but jewelry, papers, toiletries with lipglosses being the most frequent of that category) and then returns them where they were (even though we've checked there multiple times during our search for a missing item) or sometimes to an odd place days or weeks later.  It has a tendency to knock things out of our hands--packages, cups of coffee, books, etc.

I've been doing some reading trying to identify it, but keep coming across the same suggestions that dont seem to quite fit it.  The mischievous descriptors fit, but nothing else from the descriptions of house spirits I've seen seem to fit right.

My husband has a made up name he uses for it (I dont know could be a they) and sometimes he thinks it may be dead relatives playing pranks on us.  There has been nothing of an identifying nature for us to pinpoint it and I am wondering if we may be missing something.

I like talking. I'm insanely curious and I would even appreciate a walk with you, talking about the things that matter or things like.. different peanut butter jars.

I'm a simple complicated person. I care deeply, I show up for people. I try to ask caring people and if you want me to show up for a ''thing'', I might try to show up.

I like coffee, connecting, doing random things that include a walk, random parties, random activities - and more. I'm open to many things, I'm not kidding.
I like deep conversations though. I like talking about the things that matters, conversations many people do not talk about and I try to be as honest as possible because life is short.

I have amazing people in my life, but we don’t always share the same goals or challenges. I’m looking for a crew to push me to grow and have fun along the way.

About Me:
•  Love hiking, comedy shows, exploring new places, grabbing coffee, eating great food 
•  High-energy, active, and always up for an adventure.
•  Not a genius, but I’m curious and love learning.

What I’m Looking For:
•  A group to share ideas, inspire each other, and enjoy life.
•  People navigating the same challenges (employees, investing, work-life balance).

I’ve tried local networking like Chamber of Commerce and BNI but haven’t found my people yet.  Got any meetups or communities to suggest?

On surface level that doesn’t sound bad, but she has FASD which also isn’t bad either, but where I’m getting at is that I live in a small town, and so it’s really easy to run into people you know. I know her because she is obsessed with my sister and my mom kind of, but I didn’t really know much about her and she only knows me through them, and so she likes to talk to me whenever we bump into each other because I’m the closest person she has to my sister; so she asks for my number, and I didn’t think anything of it and I just gave it to her. Whenever she texts me, it is a spam of seven to eight different texts, which doesn’t seem that bad but it’s like every single time; I have my ringer on for important stuff, not a bunch of spam texts (I don’t even like having long conversations with people through text or call unless I have time or enough mental motivation), like I’m the kind of person who mutes group chats, and if I don’t answer right away, she’s going to send 5 more texts, and I just didn’t anticipate that she would want to text me and call me every single day, so so often. She doesn’t have a job cause her parents are like her caregivers, so she has all the time in the world to talk to me and wants to spend most of it talking to me, but I can only ever do it so rarely. I tried setting a boundary and being like, “hey, when I’m sent a bunch of texts like that it can overwhelm me so do you think you could just maybe not text so many texts at the same time?” and she was completely ok with that. nothing changed. I didn’t mention anything, but I just thought that was something she could remember before reaching out, it’s not that hard to send it in all one big text. A week or two later then I’m like, “hey we’re not gonna be able to talk every single day cause I’m a pretty busy person,” and she was ok with that, but now she’s sending me texts and voicemails saying stuff like she misses me and that she wants to talk to me and that i’m her Best Friend. she asks to maybe hang out too (we’ve met up for coffee and ice cream once) and I just don’t really want this friendship. I know that sounds mean and I feel horrible, but that would’ve been kindof rude of me to say “no you can’t have my phone number even though we’re having a great conversation and my phone is in my back pocket right now”, because I wasn’t really sure what I was dealing with in the first place, and I didn’t know that I would even have to deal with anything tbh. I honestly feel like an a**hole, but I don’t know what to do, and I can’t just ghost her or block her because 1. that’s mean, and 2. I’ll just run into her in town again and then she’ll be chasing me around the grocery store or something asking me why i haven’t texted or called her back, and I just know she’ll wanna talk to her family about it and then that will add people who don’t like me in town that I could potentially run into. I literally have no excuse, I could lie, but that’s messed up too, I feel lost. I don’t wanna hurt this person’s feelings, and i’m not ableist at all, i can get along with just about anyone, i have some friends who got some mental stuff going on too and i try my hardest to accommodate anything for them but i genuinely don’t feel a compatibility with this person and do not want to pursue a friendship with them and i just feel like that isn’t too much to ask for but i still feel guilty for some reason.

Detail: I thrifted an espresso maker two days ago. I took it apart to clean and found a small light brown thing stuck to the roof of the machine. Took a photo, crushed it up and tossed it into my (very tall) trash can with a lid. Kept it out for around 10 hours total between cleans and putting it back in the bag it came in. 

Last night I'm about to head to bed, lie down, and notice a very small little black bug on my chest, just hanging out. I panic - though it may have been already dead as I don't remember it moving much - and give it a squish between tissue paper. Much apologies if we're against bug gore in this subreddit or that it's not enough to go on but the pictures of the dead crushed bug are all I have. Here's the main takeaways based on my 1am observation:

\- Mainly black body. Further inspection reveals SOME brown in some symmetrical areas around what may have been the main body.

\- Yellow/green guts.

\- Transparent sections indicate wings for sure.

\- either it got caught up with a hair or it had LONG antennae. Both are likely as I've got long hair.

\- May have had little thin feet, I don't really remember it having spread out feet, almost like they were tucked inward.

\- Small head, seemed separate from body.

\- 2 or 3 section body

\- possible ace-shaped butt. Can't confirm. 

Am I dealing with roaches or just going bananas for no reason? I'm not entirely sure which variety it would be but it can't have been bigger than a millimeter or two, and I haven't seen/heard any more since.

1m9ek3m,https://i.redd.it/58t16wyon3ff1.png,My first NG watch - the Tropical dial is GREAT,"I don't think we really do reviews here, but I really wanted to preach my love for this thing to fellow enthusiasts haha...so here we go:  
  
My favorite color is brown....which most people laugh at......but it is what it is. I just like earthy things like coffee, trees, dirt, leather. This tropical dial is GORGEOUS, without being too aged looking. I was looking for something that would be a good daily driver watch that I would love enough to feel future repair or service costs would be worth it. I looked at like 1000 watches. Literally. And of the ones I could realistically afford, this is the one that stuck with me. There are many aspects of this which make it a solid buy (low profile sapphire crystal, screw down crown, hacking, 10ATM, medallion caseback, the 38mm case, Soprod P024), and I felt it was a step above a Tissot 1938 or a Hamilton....but in the end, for me it's really that brown dial that sold me.   
  
That's what sets it apart. That's what makes me feel drawn to this watch, whereas I was not as drawn to the black dial and white dial versions, or the similar 369 dials of other brands. I'm a huge fan of the Rolex Explorer, and its iconic 369 layout; I think that's one of the most attractive all-around adventure-genre watches of all time. But on account of the super cool tropical brown dial made to mimic a UV-aged black dial, I would choose this over the Rolex. I don't even see this as ""pre-aged"" to be honest; to me it's just an artistic design decision, a creative way to make this stand out from the sea of dials we see all the time. It's an aesthetic decision every bit as much as a Lapis Lazuli Zenith El Primero or the NG Meteorite F77 or a honeycomb dial or crosshair dial.

The legibility of this dial is great. I find many watch dials tend to stress the eyes, causing some micro strain whilst darting frantically across an overcrowded dial. As much as I love chronographs and fliegers etc, there can sometimes be so much going on with these complications that it's hard to use as a WATCH with ease. With some of them I find myself having to almost pause and squint to tell the time (which is the primary function of a watch, let's remember). But this warm brown dial is just soooo easy on the eyes. The ole eyeballs can stay calm and relaxed reading this, and they just seem to naturally alight upon the hour and minute hands without erratic searching. The golden tone of the markers and hands adds to this; it's readable without being harsh on the eyes the way I feel the brown/white version of this watch is.

In bright light, the brown dial is radiant, a satiny metallic brown reminiscent of the paint on a 1950s-1960s car. There's a depth to it. It reflects differently from various angles, which adds dynamic and complexity; it's not as if the entire dial face is the same shade of brown at all times. It interacts with the light in a lively fashion. The appeal is incredibly nostalgic and vintage.....In low light, the brown dial is a chocolatey and tranquil, still very attractive and easy to read, but in a more muted way.

I find the watch goes well with most fits, no matter what I wear. Kind of like black, white, or grey, brown is a neutral color of sorts if styled well, kind of like a brown shoe or belt would be. The brown just sort of blends into the rest of the fit, especially if you have the right strap on it to fit your tastes. The watch can't dress up super well, but this design shouldn't be worn with a suit anyways, IMHO. 

**Potential negatives:** I just wish it had a power reserve longer than 38 hours, but oh well....Oh, and mine seems to gain about 8 seconds per day, which isn't mind-blowing, but it's perfectly reasonable for me. Better a little fast than slow IMO.....The sapphire crystal is a bonus for many people, but those who prefer acrylic would see it as an unnecessary element that probably added to the price. Also, this sapphire can have slightly annoying reflections in lower light levels, which minimally decreases legibility....The lum is slightly dim as compared to, say, a modern dive watch, but it does the job....Lastly, the beat rate (28,800/4hz) is nice and smooth but not nearly as smooth as you find with much more expensive watches; however, that's to be expected. More expensive price tags could get this second hand ticking in an effortless sweep with no perceivable tick.

**Conclusion:** I don't think brown is for everyone. If someone sees this watch and isn't drawn to it, then just move on and forget about it. But if it grabs you, don't live in denial, and perhaps consider adding this to your wishlist to save your pennies for. As a bonus, I think it's pretty well built for the price.",5,1753486852.0,NivadaGrenchen,1,1.0,False

It started at **Rex’s Diner**, where someone (we’re looking at you, Sugoii) spiked the coffee with *space drugs*. A llama named Kevin became sentient and now runs the night shift.

Meanwhile, **Officer Chad Wigglebottom** was undercover (again) trying to bust a ring of black market emote dealers near **Legion Square**, but accidentally joined their dance crew instead. He's now doing TikToks full-time under the name *Lil Wiggle*.

On the south side of the city, a **gremlin escaped from Sagie’s car**, hijacked a hot dog stand, and was last seen sprinting down Grove Street shouting, *“All hail the Juice Lord!”* while high-fiving Mizery.

**Mayor Kimchi** attempted to make a speech at city hall, but was interrupted by Pho, who drunkenly stumbled in dressed like Captain Hook, swinging a rubber sword and challenging civilians to plank-walking duels on top of city hall.

Just a normal Tuesday.

I am unable to add a flair, but I am from Georgia🇬🇪 (country, not state) I grew up as a village kid, did not experience a city until I was 13, and now I live back in my home village. I am wondering, where are you from? What did daily life look like as a kid? What does daily life look like now as an adult?

My daily life as a village kid in Georgia consisted of being neighbors with roosters and cows. I would help with breakfast which usually would be bread, cheese, and Turkish coffee. My siblings and I would help feed the animals (chickens, pigs, cows) before school which was a walk away to the nearest town. Growing up we learned how to plant potatoes and herd sheep. Chores were (and still are a part of life). However, there was also freedom to explore the nature surrounding us. I remember being extremely young and being allowed to go off on my own to play. I loved growing up surrounded by mountains and rivers. No WiFi, but that was never a problem. My family and I attended church regularly. 

Back then and also now, family life is the most important thing. Village homes are multi-generational so grandparents, parents, children are all under one roof. Supra (last meal of the day) is sacred tradition. Even on a normal day, meals last hours as well talk. Community is also very strong, everyone knows everyone. Privacy does not exist.  

Also back then and also now, life here can be physically hard honestly. Winters are extremely harsh, infrastructure is lacking (limited healthcare, slow internet, bad roads). Many young people move to cities or abroad for jobs.



Now as a 23 year old woman who has moved back home to rural Georgia, after being in Tbilisi for 4 years, here is what my life consists of: Family is still at the center, many 23 year olds (including myself) still live with their parents. I am engaged as the normal age in Georgia to be is early-mid 20s. Even engaged, most people live at home until they are married. I still help to cook, clean, and manage the animals. I do seasonal work of hazelnut picking, and full time I work in a nearby town as a teacher. I attend church regularly, just like I did as a kid. My days usually begin as soon as the sun rises.

A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

What I’m Looking For:

	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

1m9e7vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1m9e7vt/bigger_fish/,Bigger Fish,"It was 3:17am at the Waffle House. I wiped my mouth with my sleeve and pushed the table away from my fat belly, the metal chair scraping the greasy floor. 

I had time to kill until the next job, so I headed out to the parking lot to make my way to the nearest motel. I hadn't come through this town yet, so no one should recognize me there, I figured.

Stumbling with my bum leg past the dumpsters, I about had a damn heart attack when the lid slammed. 

I shook my head and kept going.

Another slam.

Rage boiled over me. I stopped to glare back at the dumpsters, waiting to see which methed out employee had been responsible. 

The wood doors around the dumpsters creaked in the night wind, closing themselves slowly.

Another slam and the door popped open. Looking like he'd kicked it open with his foot, the employee strolled out carelessly. Whistling a jolly little tune, even.

I rolled my shoulders and huffed. This fucker was about to learn some respect. I cracked my knuckles and headed back towards him. 

""Hey!"" I shouted. 

He stopped, startled. I closed the distance and grabbed a fistful of his greasy black apron. He was mid-forties maybe, but looked eighty - he had the classic sunken eyes and leathery skin of hard living or drugs. He just stood there, mouth agape, like the stupid animal he was. I wanted to knock out his nasty black teeth.

""Do you have *any* idea--""

""Hey, you there!"" Another voice interrupted me.

The other man leaned against the building by the door, one hand in his pocket and the other smoking a cigarette. I must've been too angry to have noticed him before.

""I've been looking for a truck driver,"" he said.

My grip on the employee tightened in rage. He was shaking now. 

""'Scuse me?"" I yelled back.

""I could use a ride,"" the man said calmly, ""If you'd be so kind.""

Getting a better look at him, I was more confused. He wasn't an employee, he didn't have the stupid black apron. He wore dusty boots, raggedy jeans and a gray zip-up jacket, but his face was what interested me. Young, bright eyes, pale and smooth skin, *blonde*. Like a halo around his head. 

My anger was replaced by something else. Something darker. 

I threw the employee to the ground. ""Get lost,"" I told him. He scrambled away, where to I didn't care to look. My focus was on someone else now.

I made my way to the other man, wary but interested.

""You ain't got fuckin' family to help you?"" I asked.

He was pretty. *Too* pretty. Like one of those weird celebrities with too-perfect faces. I couldn't look away.

Surely someone would miss him if something happened to him.

""Nope,"" he answered, stomping out his cigarette, ""there's no one to care.""

He picked up the cigarette butt and flicked it into the can beside him. Like he didn't want to litter, like that one cigarette would really make a difference. 

""'Cept you, maybe,"" he said with a smile and a wink, ""maybe I can convince you to care.""

Something about him felt charming. Playful. A little ray of life in this hellhole. 

He didn't belong here.

Of course, neither did the *others* I'd picked up.

I just had one question. 

""How old are you?"" I asked.

Those blue eyes looked me up and down, studying me. Not in a nervous manner, but something else. It made me a little uncomfortable but not enough for me to care.

""Nineteen,"" he said after a pause. 

The darkness stirred again.

This was too good to be true. 

""I've got a little cash on me,"" he said, ""I'm sure we could work something out.""

I had already decided the minute I saw him.

""Fine,"" I told him, ""Hurry up.""

He smiled, a little too wide. 

""You're too kind,"" he said.

I scoffed, ""Yeah, bud, I'm a real saint.""

-

""So, where ya headed?"" I asked as we settled into the cab.

""Anywhere's better than here,"" he said.

I stifled a smile. It was funny when they said things they'd regret.

""You really got no one out here? Not family, not a girlfriend, nothin'?""

He paused to think. Then leaned a little closer, a wry, shit-eating grin on that perfect face. 

""You really think I'd be in your truck if I did?""

I chuckled openly at that one, ""Yeah, okay, you got me there.""

""Well, it's gonna be a while 'til the next stop,"" I warned him.

""Perfect"" he said, settling into his seat, ""Maybe I *will* have a friend by the end of this.""

I rolled my eyes, ""Yeah, whatever,"" I said.

His weird sense of humor was a nice change of pace, I thought. This ride might actually be enjoyable.

I usually didn't enjoy their company until they were hogtied in the back.

-

*""Last gas 103 miles""*, the sign read. 

Another hour and we'd be at the spot I'd picked out. 

*""You ever get scared out here?""*

His voice startled me. It sounded different, distorted almost. I chalked it up to the altitude fucking with my ears. 

It was the first thing he had said in maybe thirty, forty minutes, I had actually thought he was sleeping. He had been awfully quiet ever since we'd gotten off the main roads. 

""I ain't scared of nothin', kid,"" I told him. 

""C'mon, everybody gets scared,"" He pushed on, leaning closer to me like he had a secret, ""Sometimes it's even fun to be scared.""

Now *that* was funny.

I'd have to tease him about that later.

""Why the hell would I be scared out here?""

""Well, for starters,"" he said, ""there's no one else around. No one to see you, no one to hear you, no one to help you...""

I was chuckling now too, shaking my head. That was kind of the point of this, kid.

""Nothing but the pines and the fog off the creek,"" he continued.

""Well, the fog *is* annoying, I'll give you that,"" I said, ""I can't tell you how many times a fucking deer just pops out and smears itself all over the windshield.""

Even then, the fog was so thick I couldn't see but maybe a single car length in front of us. The truck lights only made it worse. I powered through up the hills like I always did. There were never any other vehicles on that road. 

""Ah, the poor deer,"" he said. ""They used to have more natural predators out here. But they were all driven off a long, long time ago.""

Something was off about him. Different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the warm and sunny act he'd put on earlier was gone. He felt cold now, distant, a little creepy even.

It didn't matter. We were almost there.

We sat in silence for another little while. I kept my eyes to the fog swirling in the headlights, he kept his eyes locked on me. Staring, without a word, like I'd vanish if he even fucking blinked.

Hell, maybe *he* was getting scared now. 

He had every right to, after all. 

The air in the cab got colder. It was supposed to be a warm night, I thought. Condensation built up on the window from the sudden change. I flipped the wipers on, sighing as they made that god-awful, nails-on-a-chalkboard screech with every swipe. 

The biggest spider I've ever seen in my life crawled out of the air vent.

""Holy shit!""

It was the size of my fucking fist, hairy and dark with yellow stripes on its legs.

I'm a proud man, not afraid of much. But I don't fuck around with goddamn tarantulas. I nearly lost control of the truck trying to whack it back to whatever hell it came from.

Silently, without even so much as a flinch, the other man placed his pale, smooth hand atop the dash. Palm up, like an offering. My mouth hung open as the spider went into his palm, and just as quickly, into his zip-up jacket.

I almost couldn't speak.

""What the FUCK was that, man!?"" I stammered, ""I swear to god if that's your FUCKING PET--""

""It's not,"" he said calmly, ""unless it wants to be.""

I was gonna explode. Surely, I would stroke-out any minute.

""And it looks to be a Tiger Wolf Spider, but I'm not an entomologist.""

""Take that thing out of your pocket, NOW,"" I demanded.

He took out the spider calmly, like it was a pack of smokes, like any of this was *normal.*

Looking at it the second time was almost worse. I squinted my eyes and looked away to the road.

""Kill that fucking thing!"" 

*""You'd like that, wouldn't you?""*

The voice wasn't his.

It waa a woman's. *Hers.* From last week.

I glanced over. 

She was in the passenger seat again. Tiny, frail like a bird, a little button-nose and blue eyes. Yellow-blonde hair. The skin on half her face was gone to gorey bone, including a hollow eye-socket. The spider climbed into it.

""What the FUCK--""

I slammed on the brakes.

The truck skid to a stop as I caught my breath. I  looked around, frantically. The young man looked groggy, bewildered. He rubbed his eyes and ran his hands through his hair.

""How long was I out?"" He asked.

""W-what do-- what the *FUCK* are you talking about!?""

My heart thumped in my ears, my throat was dry and my body soaked in sweat. I was shaking. The man was calm, half-asleep, looking at me like I had two heads.

He reached in his pocket and pulled out a pack of smokes. No spider.

""You wanna take a break?"" He asked me, concern in his soft voice.

This didn't make sense.

""Where's the goddamn spider?"" I demanded.

He jolted upright, looking in his seat and around the cab. ""There's a spider in here? Where?""

I ran my clammy hands over my face, rubbing my eyes.

I looked around the cab. Everything looked...normal. The young man just blinked at me, like an innocent little doe in headlights, hand still outstretched with the pack of smokes.

I ripped the pack from his hands. 

""We're taking a break,"" I said. 

""Cool,"" he said, disinterested. He started to follow me out of the truck.

""No, you wait inside,"" I snapped. 

""Alrighty,"" he chimed back.

I stepped out into the humid, foggy air. The temperature shocked me - it had been so much colder in the cab. I must've turned the damn AC on and not known it. 

This wasn't the spot I usually took them to, but it was close enough. Far away enough where no, no one could see or hear anything, just like that stupid kid said. It would do just fine, and I could just drive his body out farther to where I usually dumped them. But after that weird...dream, I wasn't sure I *wanted* to go where the other ones were. Maybe I would just carve out a new spot here, I thought. 

I was around the back mixing up two special cups of joe when I heard the passenger door open and close. I went back around quickly.

""Goddammit I *said* stay in the--""

No one was there. The truck lights flickered and a cold chill shook my body. I peered through the fog but there was nothing.

Maybe I *was* going a little crazy.

Maybe I was just tired. 

I took the mugs back to the inside of the cab and carefully handed the correct one to the man beside me.

""Coffee?"" I asked.

""I'm not a coffee person,"" he said politely.

""Everyone says that until they have *my* coffee,"" I winked.

He laughed and shook his head. ""You're terrible,"" he said, grinning wide with those perfect teeth.

I watched him absolutely gulp his coffee down like a sick, dying camel. 

Confused, I took a small sip of mine. It nearly burned my lip clean off.

Weird. But at least it wouldn't take as long to work, I figured. 

""So, what's your story?"" I asked him, realizing I never played the get-to-know-you game that I usually slog through with my passengers. 

""Oh, I'm just an old soul passing through,"" he said. ""My story's a long one. I don't think we'd have the time to cover it if we tried.""

""See, that. You're so young but you talk like an old fuckin' man,"" I chuckled, ""I mean, where do you get that? Where are you from?""

""Well, my ex girlfriend thought I was from the depths of hell,"" he sat his mug down, completely finished with it, ""but I assured her I'm Catholic.""

I laughed at his joke, a little too loud. I sipped my coffee. ""Women, eh?""

""I thought she was an angel. I still do,"" he said, ""but now... I doubt she could even walk into church  without bursting into flames.""

I slapped my knee, doubling over. I couldn't remember the last time I laughed so hard. My cheeks were warm. 

""You're too young to be having f-fuckin' women problems,"" I told him.

""Hmm,"" he murmured. ""But just the right age to die.""

I blinked. ""Huh?""

""That's the perfect age, isn't it?"" he said, ""Eighteen to twenty-one? Blonde hair, blue eyes, no one to miss them?""

I stammered. My thoughts were... clunky. I hadn't realized how dizzy I was getting.

No.

*No.*

That wasn't possible. I made the coffee myself, I gave him the coffee myself, he downed it in seconds! 

The cab was freezing cold again. 

My head spun, my thoughts racing. The air was humid, my mouth so dry it felt glued together. 

I was spacing out. Losing time.

Suddenly, I was in the back of the truck on the cot, where *he* was supposed to be.

The fog rolled in with me. Against it he stood, at the edge of the open truck, a dark shape in the night.

""You know, Father Romano says I shouldn't harm 'anything with a soul'"", he said. The distortion was back in his voice, like an old corrupted mix tape. He was holding rope in his hand. 

""And to tell you the truth,"" he continued, ""I've always had a soft spot for animals, so I've never liked hurting them.""

In a blink, he was next to me. Tying off my arm. Like a tourniquet. 

""But you don't *have* a soul, do you?"" 

He was in my face, inches away, so close he blurred.

""And you're *worse* than an animal because YOU. KNOW. BETTER!""

Tears rolled down my face, the sheer thunder of his voice shaking me to my core. It was unnatural. *Ungodly.*

""Why did you do it?"" His voice was soft, calm, as harmless as it had been before. ""Why did you kill all those poor little girls and boys? And to leave their bodies like that, dumped so... unceremoniously in my backyard."" 

He shook his head at me, frowning, ""At least I kill for a reason.""

His limbs began...snapping. Loud pops as they twisted, contorted, grew taller and longer. A black shadow overtook his body, erasing all trace of his humanity in a blink, like he had never had skin or clothes or even a face to begin with. There was nothing. Only a dark shape remained, made of long twisted muscle and bone, shaped like some bastardized version of a man with horns. 

Then, a smile appeared. That wide smile, so perfect and *sharp*. 

I couldn't scream. I couldn't move. 

I tried to stay awake but I was fading fast.

The figure launched towards me on all fours, moving like a spider on its freaky limbs. It was over top of me in seconds.

""God, I'm *SO HUNGRY!*"" 

His face was almost pressed against mine, bared teeth dripping saliva onto my nose and mouth. I felt nothing.

He rose back up in a blink, standing upright, legs bending to fit in the trailer. He wiped his mouth carefully and ran a clawed hand through the silhouette of his once-beautiful hair, right between his horns. He sighed.

""But I have to be patient,"" he said softly, ""You need to last... a while. I suppose I'll pick you apart, piece by piece, rationing your disgusting body...""

His face was in front of mine again, grinning.

""And then when I'm done making you useful, I'm not going to kill you - oh no, that's too easy for you...""

Everything was fading fast, patches of black closing in on me.

He grabbed my face with a clawed hand, pulling me close to make sure I heard every word.

""I'm going to dump your limbless body with all the people you've killed, way out here in the pines. You can use your *fucking teeth* to dig your way out of the mud, choking on it like you deserve.""

He dropped my face, my head slamming back down.

Everything went dark. 

I prayed I wouldn't wake up again. Not to this. 

But my prayers never meant much, and I knew from my sins that the drugs were only temporary.",2,1753485941.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

TW: >!SA, coercion to abort, emotional affair!<

**First post: My husband is best friend with his ex wife**


My husband 36M and I (34F) had been married for 8 years, together for 14 and we have a 4 years old daughters that is our whole life. 

He had been married before with Eliza, his best friend. They married at 18 and lasted 2 years and divorced. They remained best friend and when we started dating, Eliza; my husband's other best friend, Jack and my husband were a tight knit. Eliza was ""one of the bros"" and I always was ""the girlfriend"" and later ""the wife"" always an outsider, his two friends are single, so our house was always a place to crash. Even since we moved together they would show unannounced and do their own thing while I  made snacks and full meals. For the first yeard I tried my best to integrate into their clique but never worked out. It was always akward and I felt I was inserting myself where I didn't belonged so I stopped trying and relegate myself to be great host and let them do their things. 

I didn't notice at first but over the years resentment had build. I feel like a 50's house wife serving drinks and lighting cigarrettes to men. 

My husband on his own is amazing and love him. He had been a great partner and my bestfriend during this 14 years. Problem is I'm not his best friend, Eliza is. 

Every single thing that happens in our life had tl be discussed and annalized with Eliza. 

Early in our relationship I got pregnant, I took the test early in the night and we were really scared, despite this he was so reassuring with me holding me the whole night and told he was ready to do whatever I wanted to do. I said I needed to really think about it. Next day we went to our classes and agreed to lunch together. 
When we met, he asked me how I was and all, then told he had the contact of a doctor who did abortions (it was illegal back then) I asked how he found one so fast when wasnt sure what to do. Answer: he called Eliza early in the morning and she had a friend. I felt so betrayed because this was something that belonged to me and he went and shared it with someone else, ""not just  someone else is Elizs, come on!"", he said. 

During the next days everytime I saw him he has new information from Eliza and Eliza's friend. I was so confused and scared, and Eliza convinced my boyfriend we needed to it fast because it would be easier. It was so much pressure I agreed long story short it was a rat hole doctor office and I almost died there. 

To this day I don't know if I should had kept the baby or no. But better not think about it. 

When my boyfriend propossed Eliza was ""fake mad"" he didn't said first to her he was going to propose to me. The only way to placate her was to has her as a best man, despite my husband having a male best friend. 

Every little or major event in our life turns into ""yeah, I'm gonna tell now Eliza you know how she gets"" 

I was SA as a child and told this to my husband, he was the first person I talked about it. Months later Eliza and I were alone in out kitchen and she started to talk about something she heard in the news about a girl raped my a family member and then hugged me. 

When I started to try for a child and I got pregnant  I asked my husband to kept this for us for a little. It was wednesday, sunday when I saw Eliza she congratulated me. I ended up miscarrying. 

I started to look for a doctor to help me deal with my depression, again, something I wanted to keep to myself. Eliza was so understanding. 

When I was pregnant with my daughter, Eliza came full of advice on things I should do. I told her to mind her own bussines wich really hurt her feelings. I stood on my ground and told my husband I wasn't going to raise my kid with Eliza and didn't wanted to hear any advice from her. 

This was a big fight with my husband becaude I was rude and Eliza was family and already considered herself and auntie. This had been the only time I had given an ultimatum to my husband ""Eliza better keep herself away from my motherhood or will leave"" 

Now resentment has reached a point when I don't want her near me or my house or my husband. 

I feel she is more married to my husband than I. 

My whole life feels like I live best friends to lover drama. 

I'm not sure why I'm writings this. Probably because I'm alone in a coffee shop and thinking I want my husband to be my husband and not feel like a lame love interest in someone else epic love story. 

In the past my husband thought I was being childish. Despite loving him I cant keep to be married like this. I dont feel I can trust to talk to him again without involving Eliza, I don't want to hold an ultimatums.

TL;DR My husband is best friend with his ex wife. I dont trust him anymore.

**Second post: UPDATE. my husband is best friend with his ex wife**

I'm gonna start saying how thankfull I'm to everybody that showed grace on my last post. 

This isn't a happy update, if anything welcome to the pity, angsty train. 

After writing my post and reading how most people felt about, my head was full of doubs and sadness. Your opinion isn't a surprise since most of my friends and family had voiced the same at some point. I guess I'm too slow and need to be punched harder to understand. 

Few days after my post, I took a pregnancy test and it was positive.  Having a large family is what I (we) always wanted and ever since my abortion I was left with a feeling of having empty arms. So holding my daughter in my arms was like feeling whole again and know I need to grow my arms even more to hold my new baby too💫. But after the initial happiness a ugly feeling started to grow in my stomach. I didn't wanted Eliza in our life. 

It felt like taking my inocence glasses out and I was able to see her. Like really see her. How every smile was so damn fake, every compliment was always mean spirit or kinda a self compliment ""nice potato salad it was great, oh, remember (to my husband) THAT potato salad I made it was kinda unbelievable blahblahblah"" or ""nice outfil I LOVE how confedent you are, I can't leave the house without making sure my outfit is flawless"" 

Her reaction to my first pregnancy, wedding, travels, my second pregnancy, buying a house. How everything that should be between my husband and I, always include her, like if our life  was a play she should write and direct. 

On our first christmas together she came when we were decorating and with all his positive cristics, I ended sitting in a corner drinking wine while she and my husband decorate.

She is always here. And by here I mean in my life. She has a say in everything in my life, to the point that when my husband voice his opinion I can say when these are his words and when are Eliza's.  

I'm no saying that since I wrote the last post everybody turned into ultimate evils, but thinking and rethinking about my life with my husband, I had always been a pasive character, its like my husband got himself a pet and he and Eliza are going to be endgame when they both realize they never stopped loving each other. 

Some of you, as my sister, will say I'm dormant. I guess I am. I have let this go for so long that it becomes normal.  My life isn't bad, my hudband hasn't been a bad husband and Eliza isn't so bad if the bar is she hasn't tried to kill me yet. I know is clear to you all, but to me it have been my life for years, my day to day, I learned to look away and make me small so I don't make others uncomfortable. 

Maybe because I'm pregnant and hormonal but I'm tired of this. I love my husband but I feel he can't love fully with Eliza whispering to his ear and him running like a golden retriever to please her. 

So after all that thinking and rethinking I sat my husband down and told him we needed to set some strong boundaries because our marriage was working and I didn't feel loved or respected like a wife or even a person. I explained more of less what I said here. My husband denied everything and tried to explain himself saying Eliza was like a sister to him, I say even siblings have boundaries. It was back and forth, with him making me doubt if maybe I was in fact trying to control who was or wasnt in his life. Wanting to monitor his friendships and even joked if will need to sly away to have a drink with his buds. For a moment I feel maybe I was in fact crazy. 

But I was firm into my ground: If he wanted to kept this marriage Eliza needs to be gone from our life. 

At first I thought low contact was good but seeing his reaction I knew that wasn't going to be enough, maybe _I_ wouldn't bee seeing Eliza, but he certainly will do and I would be antagonized and mocked.  Honestly knowing this made me realize my marriage was over. 

So I asked important questions and pressed: what his real feeling were? Why they divorced if they where so hung into each other? Why no leave me sooner? Why no _leave me_? Did he loves Eliza more than me? Why? What is that? What is that, that I dont have and she does that makes her imposible to leave? 

In a summary: he loves her, but he loves me, he doesn't understand how. Both of us bring something he doesn't want to miss. He is not sure if he wants a life with Eliza like the one we have, a marriage, a family. But she is his soulmate. They divorce because between then it was so much fire the were burning eachother, with me he has calm, peace and loving place to come back. He have never cheated, but admists he sometimes fantasies with her being me and me being her. They often talk about them having this life but agree that being together would break their bond. All fucked up, my god. 

I know is was kinda obvious to you all on my first post and it should have been obvious to me, but hearing my husband saying he loves another woman that is his souldmate and he put her in the center of our life, made her an auntie to our daughter and somekind of sister in law to me, a suppose family friend. I'm not gonna lie, it broke me, I threw myseld in the floor and hugged his legs and asked him what I need to do to him to love me, to ONLY love ME. i felt so pathetic, but I believed everything was worth to save something with so much value like my marriage. I cried and cried and cried. And the hardest part was to hear there was nothing I could do. 

This. This is all. I know isnt some shocking new,  to me my life is falling appart, the only thing holging me up are two little hands that hug me every night and the small bean in my belly. 

We haven't discussed anything legal yet. He left the house and my sister and mom and staying with us for now.

Amazingly low priced, and surprisingly good","Gang, if you rehearse or gig with LV cymbals, here's an option for realistic feeling and surprisingly good sounding LV cymbals. For just over $50 (USD), I got a set with 14"" hats, 16 & 18"" crashes, 20"" ride, and a (cheaply mad) bag.

There's a video on the Amazon page, and you can hear how much better the plain (gold) version sounds compared to the black coated versions. I just got a set of the gold ones. These aren't quite as convincing as the Agean R cymbals, but they're plausible on their own for coffee shop/small-pub style gigs.

And at this price, they're crazy value if you use LV cymbals in a hybrid e-kit.

Looks like a whack-a-mole Chinese brand, and so who knows how long they'll be available or made this way. But the set I just got punches far above its weight.",2,1753485446.0,edrums,0,1.0,False

We're still together and co-parenting, but now we both have space to explore.

I’ve only had one date so far, and I'm just starting to use apps like Tinder, Bumble, Feeld and OkCupid. Everything feels new... and a bit confusing. I’ve never had casual relationships before, so I’m learning from scratch.

I'm a man looking for women. I mention my open relationship clearly in my profile. I'm not looking for drama or to lie. Just honest connections.

I'd love advice on things like: 

– What not to do on a first date

– How to bring up being in an open relationship without scaring someone off

– How casual dating works today

– Messaging: how often is “too much”?

– Where to go on a first date (bar, coffee, something different?)

– How to handle physical attraction without rushing or being awkward


I’m kind of a homebody, I love cooking, I’m deeply curious about people... and I value real chemistry. Not just sex.

I've tried going clean diet wise, but it still hurts to eat even cucumber. My doctor put me on a PPI, and I started to feel a bit better.

I had no idea what it really did, but I quickly downloaded one of those free ones just to see.

Now I’m sitting here wondering what a VPN actually does behind the scenes. I get that it hides your IP and sort of gives you privacy, but how much of that is marketing and how much is real protection? Also, do most of you use it only for privacy, or are there other reasons? I’ve heard people say they use it to watch shows from other countries too, which sounds kinda cool.

Anyway, just trying to understand if this is something I should be using all the time or only in public places. What's the real point of a VPN?",1,1753485208.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

My surgery was on an emergency basis. I'd had the gastro intestinal issues for months at least, likely years, but no doc ever suggested gall bladder problems until the morning I went to emergency with the worst pain I'd had since childbirth.

They got me out of pain (on the 4th med they tried) then in the evening I had my laparoscopic surgery. I was given a regular breakfast the next morning (egg omelette, juice, coffee) which I think was a mistake but I ate it. Discharged a few hours later.

Now that I think about it, probably my massive diarrhea the next couple days was due to that breakfast. After that for a week or 2 I ate mostly bone broth, cottage cheese and applesauce, maybe a banana. Still lots of diarrhea, lessening over time. Even now I get the runs if I eat certain rich or weird fats. By weird I'm thinking of a packaged ""healthy"" flat bread stuffed with potatoes and spices. The fat used was maybe palm oil or cottonseed oil. Diarrhea for 2 days lol. But no more pain, and by the 3d week post surgery I was back to my previous energy levels so I thought that was fine. 

But good news! Now since the 4th week post surgery I have more energy than I've had for years! 

And regarding pain: I've had very little pain, no more than what tylenol can take care of. My arthritis bothers me more that my post surgery pain did. Which reminds me, if it's relevant I'm a 71 year old woman.",3,1753485043.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

1m9dq3g,https://i.redd.it/nflrwln3q3ff1.jpeg,Update on spicy cucumber salad cocktail,"I posted about a month ago asking for recipes using Asian cucumber salad juice in a cocktail. I got a lot of great suggestions but decided to go my own direction working with what I had in the house already. 

I made the cucumber salad dish and infused Cazadores tequila blanco with the remaining juice/chili crisp solution from the salad. Let that sit in the fridge for about a month then strained it through a coffee filter. After filtering I added a few drops of sesame chili oil and a dash of sea salt. It's strong AF so I went really light on the use of tequila in the actual cocktail, at the recommendation of my former bartender husband.

Now for the recipe:

- .5oz spicy cucumber tequila
- dash of sugar
- juice from 1/3 lime

Shake over ice, strain into ice in martini glass, and fill to rim with club soda. Garnish with lime.

It actually turned out delicious and I'm so happy! You can still taste the cucumber salad essence and it's very drinkable (I don't typically drink tequila but this is a big hit for me). This is my first cocktail so I tried to keep it light and simple, very satisfied and excited to scale it up to a larger glass!",3,1753484640.0,cocktails,2,0.81,False

I’m Sushmita, a fashion entrepreneur and the founder of Aurese – a women’s formalwear brand crafted for modern professionals. I recently moved to Dehradun hoping to build my startup with the support of a friend, but things didn’t go as planned — and I now find myself needing to rebuild my base from scratch here.

I’ve already developed my product line and am now preparing for the shoot + launch phase, but I’m currently looking for:
	•	An affordable PG/shared space to stay short-term (under ₹6k/month if possible)
	•	A chance to connect with entrepreneurs, creatives, designers, or marketers in Dehradun
	•	Opportunities to collaborate or offer my skills (branding, digital marketing, fashion styling, social media) in exchange for support or work

My goal is to launch a high-impact fashion brand from the ground up. I’d love to meet like-minded people who are passionate about startups, design, or building something meaningful.

If you have any leads, suggestions, or would just like to connect over coffee or coworking, I’d truly appreciate it.

Thanks in advance for reading and supporting 💛

I made a pour over batch of decaf using my main squeeze, the Kalita Wave 185S. I first got the carafe hot, then poured in enough 4mg THC drink to fill the bottom of the carafe and just a little more. Then I brewed coffee as normal. Then I added a teaspoon of light creamer. I took a spoon and swirled the carafe. 

The result is very tasty. I poured just enough THC drink to not overpower the flavor but to be present. It has a light berry flavor, a little nutty from the beans, and smooth all around. 

This is a great mixed drink and would highly recommend it if you’re looking for some bloodstream double whammy effects. ",0,1753484541.0,pourover,3,0.25,False
