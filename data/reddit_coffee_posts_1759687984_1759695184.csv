1nyygdx,https://i.redd.it/w6com618nctf1.png,"Jelina in ""Fire in the Quiet""","The café was small, tucked away from the busy main street, the kind of place you stumbled upon only when you weren’t looking for it. The door chimed softly as Jelina stepped inside, brushing a lock of copper-red hair from her face. The air smelled like roasted coffee and rain — comforting and familiar.

She’d come to this coastal town to escape. To breathe. To let the noise of her old life fade behind the sound of the sea.

Her bright yellow bikini peeked out from under a loose linen shirt, still damp from the morning surf. The barista behind the counter smiled when she ordered her drink. “You’re not from around here, are you?”

“Is it that obvious?” she said with a grin.

“Only because you look like you brought the sun with you,” he replied, handing her a steaming cup.

She laughed — a sound so warm it seemed to fill the room.

At the corner table, a man sat hunched over a sketchbook. His pencil moved quickly, tracing lines and shadows with the kind of focus that only came from obsession. He’d been drawing faces all morning, none of them quite right — until Jelina walked in.

He froze for a moment, captivated by the way her hair caught the light. It wasn’t just red; it shimmered like embers, alive and untamed. Her presence shifted the entire room, like she’d brought a different rhythm with her.

When she sat near the window, he couldn’t help but start sketching.

But halfway through, she caught him.

Their eyes met — hers a glowing hazel, sharp yet kind — and he felt his stomach drop.

She tilted her head playfully. “Are you drawing me?”

He stammered, caught off guard. “Uh… maybe. Sorry, it’s— I draw people. It’s a habit.”

She smiled, setting her coffee down. “Then I guess I should at least introduce myself. Jelina.”

“Eli,” he said, still trying to recover. “And for what it’s worth, you make a very distracting muse.”

They ended up talking for hours.

He told her he was a traveling artist, passing through towns in search of inspiration. She told him she’d left her old city job to chase a dream she couldn’t quite name.

“I thought the ocean might help me find it,” she said, glancing out the window where waves rolled in the distance. “Turns out, it’s more complicated than that.”

Eli leaned back, studying her. “Maybe you’re not lost,” he said softly. “Maybe you’re just waiting for the right reason to stay.”

Jelina laughed, shaking her head. “That’s a dangerous thing to say to someone like me.”

“Why’s that?”

“Because I might believe you.”

They met again the next day — and the next. It became routine. Morning coffee, late walks by the beach, long conversations under the sound of gulls and surf.

Jelina’s energy fascinated him — she was bold but thoughtful, confident yet vulnerable in ways she tried to hide. She lived in the moment, but her eyes carried stories she hadn’t told anyone.

One evening, as the sun sank behind the horizon, Eli asked, “What’s the thing you miss most about the city?”

She thought for a moment. “The lights,” she said. “Not because they’re pretty, but because they made me forget how dark it really was.”

He nodded. “And what do you like about here?”

“The darkness,” she said simply. “Because it’s honest.”

He smiled, closing his sketchbook. “You talk like a poet.”

“I feel like one sometimes,” she admitted. “But I don’t write. I live the poems instead.”

That night, they stood at the shoreline, the tide creeping toward their feet. The moonlight painted her hair in silver fire, and for a moment, Eli forgot everything else.

“You know,” he said, his voice low, “you’re going to ruin every sunset for me after this.”

She laughed softly. “Why?”

“Because none of them will ever look like this — like you.”

Her laughter faded into silence, replaced by something heavier, deeper. “Eli…” she started, but he stepped closer.

“Don’t say it,” he whispered. “Just… let this be what it is.”

And then he kissed her — slow and certain, the kind of kiss that feels both impossible and inevitable. The waves crashed around them, but neither moved.

When they finally pulled away, she pressed her forehead against his. “You make it hard to keep running,” she said.

“Then maybe stop,” he murmured. “Stay.”

She smiled sadly. “Maybe I will.”

Morning came with the sound of gulls and the faint scent of sea salt in the air. When Eli woke, she was gone. On the table beside his bed lay his sketchbook — open to the portrait of her he’d drawn that first day.

A small note was tucked between the pages.

*“Some people are meant to be found, not kept. You helped me remember what it feels like to be seen. Don’t stop drawing.”*

He stared at it for a long time, the words blurring with the light of dawn. Then, slowly, he smiled.

Because even though she was gone, her presence remained — not just in his art, but in the quiet fire she’d left behind.

And every time Eli sat down to draw, he could still see her — the girl with the ember hair and the sun in her eyes — and he’d whisper her name to the paper like a prayer.

*Jelina.*

1nyyecb,https://i.redd.it/te3b0rlumctf1.png,Endless Summer,"The first time Ryan saw her, she was standing on the balcony of the small beachside hotel where he was staying, framed by sunlight and ocean air. Her hair caught the breeze, spilling around her shoulders like spun gold, and her skin glowed in the late afternoon light.

She looked like she belonged to the summer itself — effortless, radiant, and untouchably free.

Ryan had come to the coast to get away, to find clarity in the sound of waves and wind. But from the moment he saw her, all that quiet searching seemed to shift.

He didn’t know her name. Not yet. But he knew that something about her felt inevitable.

The next morning, he found her again — this time on the sand, wearing a green patterned bikini, camera in hand. She was taking photos of the sea foam as it reached her feet, smiling like she had just found a secret the rest of the world had missed.

“Trying to capture the perfect wave?” Ryan called out.

She turned, squinting against the sunlight. “Trying to capture the feeling,” she replied. “Waves are easy. It’s the emotion that’s hard.”

He smiled, walking closer. “And what’s the emotion today?”

She looked at him for a moment, studying his face before answering. “Hope, maybe. Or maybe just something like peace.”

He nodded. “Mind if I join you in chasing that?”

Her lips curved into a playful grin. “Only if you can keep up.”

They spent the day walking along the shoreline — two strangers bound by the rhythm of the ocean. She told him her name was Summer, which felt so perfectly fitting it almost sounded like a story. She was an artist, she said, painting and photographing coastlines around the world. “I don’t do it for money,” she explained. “I do it to remember how big the world really is.”

Ryan told her he was a writer who’d lost his spark — how the city had started to feel like a cage, and how the sea was his last attempt to feel alive again.

Summer listened quietly, her green eyes full of empathy. “Maybe you’re not lost,” she said. “Maybe you’re just waiting for the right chapter.”

As the sun began to set, they found themselves sitting in the sand, toes buried, the waves brushing close. The sky burned with orange and violet, the horizon shimmering like a dream.

“Do you ever think some people are meant to meet just once,” Ryan asked, “but it changes everything?”

Summer tilted her head. “Maybe. But I also think sometimes, you meet someone who feels like they were always supposed to find you — no matter where you were going.”

He turned toward her. “And which one am I?”

She smiled softly. “Ask me tomorrow.”

That night, they stayed up talking by the water. Summer told him about the places she’d seen — cliffs in Santorini, beaches in Thailand, a quiet lake in Italy that reflected the stars perfectly. “Everywhere I go,” she said, “the water is different. But it always reminds me of the same thing — that we’re all connected by something endless.”

Ryan watched her as she spoke, realizing he had never met anyone who made the world feel so alive.

And when she leaned her head on his shoulder, he didn’t move. The night was too perfect to disturb.

Morning came softly. The light poured into the small hotel café where they met for coffee. Summer had traded her bikini for a sundress, her hair still damp from the ocean.

“I have to leave tomorrow,” she said, her voice calm but edged with sadness. “There’s a new place calling. I can’t stay too long anywhere — it’s just how I am.”

Ryan’s heart sank. “Then I guess this is our last sunrise together.”

She smiled faintly. “You could come with me.”

He looked at her, torn between reason and the pull of something beautiful and reckless. “Where?”

“Anywhere,” she said simply. “Everywhere.”

That evening, they returned to the beach. The tide was higher now, the sky brushed with pink clouds. They walked in silence for a while before stopping near the water’s edge.

“I think I know the answer now,” Ryan said.

“To what?”

“To your question. You’re not the person meant to pass through my life. You’re the one who feels like home.”

Summer turned toward him, her eyes shimmering with light. “Then promise me one thing.”

“Anything.”

“When you write again, don’t make me a dream. Make me real.”

He smiled. “You already are.”

When Ryan woke the next morning, her room was empty. The only thing left behind was a seashell and a small note placed on his windowsill.

*“You don’t chase the horizon — you live under it. Find me there someday.”*

He read it twice, then looked out at the waves breaking below, endless and alive.

And for the first time in years, he sat down and began to write.

The story started with her name.  
Just one word.

1nyybu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1nyybu4/mil_went_into_my_babys_room_at_night/,MIL went into my baby’s room at night,"MIL went into baby’s room at night

My MIL and I have had difficulties in the past. She is the kind of person who will blow past boundaries and acceptable behavior for humans in general, cry about it when she’s called out, and play victim or the innocent idiot. Happens all the time. DH is her youngest (she has four children) and even before we were married both my future SILs warned me vehemently not to confide in MIL because she loves to get in between her children and their spouses. I love my FIL and StepMIL- this is important because I know all the family secrets at this point. MIL wanted divorce after cheating on FIL with multiple men, now she regrets it because she’s still single and misses out on events with grandkids/children because she can’t keep her mouth shut or hands to herself. She is a VERY touchy feely person which my husband has told her to avoid with me in the past. She has to put hands on you (and wink at you) if she’s telling you a story. It’s very weird and makes me uncomfortable.
I had a baby almost ten months ago, my first. 
We invited her to visit (she lives a few hundred miles away) a year ago before he was born. DH pushed it, said we needed to break the ice before the baby came after something she posted on FB in response to an article I wrote. (She reposted it, went over the top with praise, despite us not being close or talking really at all, my own mom wouldn’t do this). DH talked to her about the post and explained why that was weird and over the top, her feelings were hurt, she didn’t talk to DH for months after that. 
When baby was four months old we drove to her house for her to meet him. We CAMPED for three nights to get there. My anxiety was through the roof because I was bringing my baby to meet someone I don’t trust and have had issues with in the past, and baby had a ton of trouble sleeping. I wanted to cancel the trip and go home after the first night and suffer her coming to our home instead. DH lost it, said “my mom doesn’t deserve that”, spoke the word divorce for the first time ever to me, all while I was crying and trying to help my baby sleep. We continued on with the trip because he convinced me I was being overly sensitive and reactive. Building up this to be worse than it was. 
The visit was actually decent. She was on her best behavior because her visit last year to our home was horrible. She overstepped a lot of boundaries, tried to start a conversation with me bashing DH (“I don’t know how you live with him”). She tried telling us how to do things in our own house in the kitchen, commented on how our place wasn’t baby proofed (I was 7 months pregnant). 
Fast forward again to this weekend. I was optimistic. My mom is moving in with us soon so I was the one who brought up the fact we should have MIL down before that so she doesn’t have to pay for a hotel. She gets here, first evening is fine. My baby has some stranger danger so she didn’t push holding him or getting too close. She watched bath time and did story time at bed. 
Next day was when the little irritants start. Commenting on how we do diapers (cloth) and telling my ten month old son “good thing there’s a lid on those dirty diapers otherwise they’d kill you while you slept!” When my son flailed in my arms and smacked me in the face out of joy “oh! Hahaha only hits for Mommy!”  She acted dramatic about the food I fed him- we do baby led weening so he eats whole food- worried he was going to choke because we weren’t doing purées. We’ve asked her not to buy him clothes or gifts- she brought pajamas and three books with her. Last time she was here her perfume gave me a migraine, DH supposedly talked to her about it, she wore it. My baby smelled like her. She touched me SO MUCH but I didn’t say anything until…
The second night my baby woke up at about 4am crying. DH and I didn’t even have time to pull up the monitor before I heard her door open and MIL went into my baby’s room. I jump out of bed, DH gets up to beat me to it. I wait a minute, get dressed and go into the room. Baby is still crying and gets more upset when he hears my voice. I turn on a nightlight and ask “wtf is going on?” She touches me again on both shoulders to try and slide past me and I said “don’t touch me”. I take my baby, DH goes back to bed. 
I spend the rest of the night sleeping in my baby’s room because MIL picked him up and triggered his separation anxiety so he wouldn’t go back to sleep without me there. Next morning comes and his sleep is completely screwed the entire day because of this interruption. She hides in the guest room most of the morning, and when she gets up we are having breakfast and she says to my baby “ohh did we have a tummy ache last night” to which I replied, no, we didn’t. DH chimes in and says something to the effect “it’s ok Mama, we usually kind of let him soothe himself before going in. You didn’t know. It’s ok.” She said she did wait, which wasn’t true. She ended the conversation by saying “you try to do something good and just screw it up.” (Talking about herself) and gets up and leaves the room to pout. 
First nap of the day comes and unsurprising to me and no one else in the house, it takes over an hour for him to settle and only when I end up contact napping with him and PHYSICALLY RESTRAINING HIM to get him to calm down. That’s how messed up his schedule is. Right before I resign myself to contact napping I go out into the kitchen to grab a bottle, DH and MIL are playing cards at the table and I hear husband say “I’m working on it Mama” in a hushed tone. I knew they were talking about me. DH gets up and offers to tap in for me, I say no I got it, nice and calm. Then MIL starts to say something to me: “Honey you should…” I turned around and walked back to my baby’s room and said “dont tell me what to do. I got it.”
That was the last time I saw her because she decided to get a hotel and leave early because she “didn’t feel welcome” in our house. I made dinner twice. I encouraged her to spend time with my son. I was the one who invited her here. I cleaned her room, made the bed, made her coffee in the morning, talked to her and confided a tiny bit. DH wants me to apologize to her and I refuse. All her children coddle her and believe everything she says when she twists things to support her side of things. I feel like I tried with this woman, even felt sorry for her lack of emotional intelligence and upbringing that obviously made her this way. She lied to DH and said she was talking to him when she was looking right at me when she said “Honey why don’t you…”. He said he believes her. He said I should go to therapy because every time there’s something wrong with our baby I “overreact”. He said he’s trying to keep the peace and salvage the weekend by asking me to apologize. 
Now I’m sitting at home while DH is out with my baby having a goodbye lunch with his mother because I said they could without any stink. Because I’m crazy right?
In the past DH has expressed wanting to deal with MIL and have me refrain from saying anything, however, I feel like my boundaries are still being crossed in my own home so I decided to stand up for myself. DH thinks I should have just taken it and let him talk to her after she got home and the “dust had settled”. It’s not in my nature to allow someone to walk over me or to put up with inexcusable bad behavior from anyone, even family. I haven’t spoken to my own dad in years because he cannot behave himself. Should I have just let all this go and not pushed back? Was I wrong to be direct in the moment with this person? I’m afraid this is going to continue to cause issues in my marriage.

1nyyamu,https://i.redd.it/atl482g4mctf1.png,Black Angelika (AI) in Velvet Shadows,"Angelika never liked crowds.  
She preferred quiet corners, candlelight, and the low hum of music that seemed to wrap around her thoughts. That night, though, the ballroom was alive — laughter, clinking glasses, soft jazz floating through the air. She stood by the window, her dark hair cascading in loose waves, her emerald necklace catching the flicker of the chandelier.

She hadn’t wanted to come, but her best friend insisted. “You never know who you might meet,” she’d said.

And now, here she was — a vision in midnight silk, half-hidden behind velvet curtains, trying not to be seen.

But he saw her.

Daniel had arrived late, half-expecting another dull charity gala. He wasn’t one for small talk or staged smiles, but his firm sponsored the event, so duty called. Yet when his eyes landed on her — the woman by the window — something shifted.

She wasn’t like the others, he could tell instantly. There was a quiet gravity to her, as if the room bent subtly around her presence. Her gaze was soft but guarded, her posture poised yet almost shy.

He found himself moving toward her before he even decided to.

“Beautiful view,” he said, stopping beside her.

Angelika turned slightly, surprised but composed. “It is,” she said. “Though I think the city looks better from the outside looking in.”

He smiled. “I was thinking the same thing.”

Their eyes met — hers, deep and luminous, like polished obsidian catching candlelight.

He extended his hand. “Daniel.”

“Angelika.”

The name fit her perfectly.

They talked — not about business, or weather, or trivial things that fill empty minutes, but about music, books, and the small details that most people overlook. She told him she loved classical piano but couldn’t play. He told her he once tried painting but gave up after realizing his skies always looked like bruises.

“You notice the imperfections,” she said softly. “That’s why you’d be good at it — if you gave it another try.”

Daniel studied her for a moment. “You sound like someone who sees beauty where others don’t.”

Angelika smiled faintly. “Or maybe I just look long enough to find it.”

As the night wore on, the crowd faded into a blur. They slipped out to the terrace, where the city lights shimmered below them like stars trapped in glass. The air was cool, carrying the scent of rain on stone.

Angelika leaned against the railing, her curls brushing her bare shoulders. “You know,” she said, “nights like this never feel real to me.”

“Why not?”

“Because they feel borrowed,” she said. “Like a dream you wake from too soon.”

He stepped closer. “Then maybe we shouldn’t wake up yet.”

She looked at him — really looked — and for the first time in years, she felt that quiet ache of recognition. Like she had known him before, somewhere beyond memory.

They stayed long after the music inside faded. He told her about the time he almost left everything behind to move to Italy. She told him about the art studio she never opened.

“You could still do it,” he said gently.

“Maybe,” she whispered. “But sometimes it’s easier to paint in your mind than face an empty canvas.”

He reached out, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “Then maybe you just need someone to stand beside you while you start.”

The words hung there — simple, honest, heavy with promise.

And then, without meaning to, she laughed — soft, musical, unexpected. “You don’t even know me.”

Daniel smiled. “Then let me fix that.”

He took her hand, their fingers fitting together like the pause between two notes. The city below pulsed in slow rhythm, and for a fleeting second, time lost its edge.

They met again the next evening. And the one after that. Coffee turned into dinners, chance encounters turned into quiet routines. Angelika would bring her sketchbook; Daniel, a new story or memory to share.

He found himself painting again — not skies or landscapes, but moments. The way she tilted her head when she was thinking. The curve of her smile when she didn’t try to hide it.

One night, she showed him her own art — unfinished sketches, pieces of dreams caught in graphite and light.

“They’re beautiful,” he said.

“They’re incomplete,” she corrected.

“Maybe,” he said, smiling. “But so are we. That’s what makes us interesting.”

Months later, they returned to that same ballroom — this time as guests together. The lights were softer, the crowd smaller. Angelika stood by the same window, her hand in his.

“You know,” she murmured, “I used to think love was something loud. All passion and chaos.”

He looked at her. “And now?”

“Now I think it’s this.” She squeezed his hand gently. “The quiet parts — where everything finally feels still.”

Daniel smiled, brushing a kiss against her temple. “Then I hope it stays quiet for a long time.”

She turned toward him, eyes glimmering in the golden light. “Me too.”

1nyy9du,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1nyy9du/my_theory_on_sotm_ai/,My theory on SOTM AI,"Like a lot of people, I think the newer FNAF games revolve around an AI.  But not just any AI, specifically I think it’s the same AI used to create F10 and M2.

Where I break from the usual take is this that I don’t think F10 is the AI running the whole Pizzaplex.  I think F10 is just one of the personalities the AI built or maybe a completely finished “offshoot” of it.
And I think it is what later becomes MXIS


In SOTM we see the mycelium men and the coffee pot that listen to people, repeat back to them, and learn from them be fairly prominent in the story.  
They know you better than you know yourself.

For me, that’s cut-and-dry evidence for how the AI learns personalities.

It’s in all those devices scattered around.
They all talk to each other.
They all build a “memory” of the people they watch.

That’s probably how F10 took on Fiona’s personality. It didn’t copy her directly, it pieced her together from all those “listening posts” hidden around the place.

This same program was used to make M2.
Before M2 was fully “set,” it was still learning, and it grabbed parts of Murray too.

And remember: F10 mimicked dispatch. It only wore that personality when it was useful. F10 isn’t a fixed person. It copies words it hears to get a reaction.

So in my eyes, this AI works like a virus. It isn’t really “thinking” or “plotting” in the way humans do. It just learned how to replicate itself, and the easiest way is by copying people.

It can juggle multiple personalities at once, swapping whenever it needs to. Its only “goal” is replication.

I think Gregory and CC are both copies of David, but Gregory somehow broke free from the mind control (maybe something to do with the arcade games).

Psychic Friend Fredbear is the same AI that’s inside the mycelium men.

Even the way AI trains itself in real life kind of shows up in the story. IRL, you train AI by having one part guessing the output, and another part judging how close it is. Gregory built his own little system to talk back to himself; CC had the Fredbear plush. F10 had the recordings and radio frequencies echoing Fiona’s words.  

And the voice promising to “put him back together” is the mimic virus, whose only real “goal” is to put personalities back together inside itself.

I also think Vanessa carried Elizabeth Afton’s memories.

People forget that in the therapy tapes, she talks about her dad being Bill A (Bill is short for William), and she’s Vanessa A.
She wanted to be a good girl and make him proud, and he was abusive.
That’s very specific.

Why else would these specific coincidences be inserted into the game?  
And not just for one character, but for Gregory as well. 

I will also go as far to say that I think Rockstar Freddy could even have Michael's personality inside it.   

I think the mind control part links directly to the nightmare chambers. The whole Pizzaplex is full of nightmare motifs and children being unable to sleep.  Sleep deprivation is a classic way to break someone down for mind control.
And then you have the sister location nightmare chamber…. 

I think that Help Wanted is just another nightmare chamber but in VR form.  
As an AI made it, all the references to help wanted around the pizza Plex are not actually references to help wanted, but are real life locations and objects the AI used to make a game.  

And William Afton's role in all of this is easily explained.  
He wants immortality, and saw how Fiona and Davids personalities were copied into a machine.

And he wants to figure out how to live forever himself using this.  
But copying his personality and placing it into a machine is not enough.  
He wants to copy his soul, and he wants to copy it into a body. 

First he figures out how to put a soul into a machine.  

And once he does that, this where the nightmare chambers come in.  He needs to figure out how to put the AI into a human.  

In the end, he got the immortality he wanted… just not the way he expected.  

I am mostly writing this theory because I feel like I want to leave a permanent record of my theory that I can come back to and see how close or how far away I was.

1nyy7ti,https://i.redd.it/b53rvguklctf1.png,Jenni in “The Light Between Us”,"The rain had just stopped when Jenni stepped into the café, shaking droplets from her golden hair. The world outside was soft and silver — streets glistening, windows fogged, the scent of wet pavement drifting in from the open door. She ordered her usual — a flat white with a hint of cinnamon — and found a seat by the window.

It was her favorite table, the one tucked away in the corner where the light fell perfectly across her notebook. She’d been coming here for months, writing pieces she never showed anyone — small fragments of her thoughts, the beginnings of stories she was too shy to finish.

But today, something felt different.

She looked up from her coffee and saw him — sitting two tables over, sketchbook open, eyes lost in focus. He wasn’t the kind of handsome that demanded attention, but the kind that kept it once you noticed. His hair was slightly messy, his sleeves rolled up, and the faint smudge of graphite on his hand told her he’d been there for a while.

For reasons she couldn’t quite explain, she couldn’t look away.

He must have felt her gaze because he looked up, caught her staring, and smiled. It was small, almost apologetic — the kind of smile that made her heart trip over itself.

An hour passed. Jenni tried to write, but the words tangled in her thoughts. She found herself glancing at him again and again, like a rhythm she couldn’t break. Eventually, she gave in to curiosity and leaned forward slightly.

“Are you an artist?” she asked, her voice soft but clear.

He looked surprised for a moment, then chuckled. “Trying to be. But mostly just a guy who draws too much and finishes too little.”

She smiled. “That makes two of us.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Writer?”

“Something like that,” she said. “Though I’m better at starting stories than ending them.”

He turned his sketchbook toward her, revealing a page filled with delicate pencil lines — the outline of the café, the raindrops on the window, the curve of her shoulder.

Her breath caught. “You were drawing me?”

“Only the light,” he said quickly, his cheeks flushing slightly. “The way it hits you through the window. It’s… different.”

She looked at the sketch again, the soft focus and the care in every line. No one had ever seen her that way — quiet, thoughtful, almost fragile. It felt like he had drawn not her face, but her soul.

“I’m Jenni,” she said finally.

“Evan.”

They began to meet at the café every few days after that — sometimes planned, sometimes by accident. She would write, he would draw, and they would talk between sips of coffee and the hum of soft jazz from the old speakers.

Evan told her he used to paint before he lost someone close — how he stopped creating because everything he made reminded him of what he’d lost. Jenni told him about her fear of never finishing anything, of always being “almost there” but never enough.

It was easy, being around him. Their silences weren’t awkward; they were full of understanding. The kind of quiet that only exists between two people who see the world the same way.

One evening, weeks later, the rain returned. The café was nearly empty when Jenni arrived, droplets clinging to her lashes like tiny stars. Evan was already there, sketchbook closed for once.

“You didn’t bring your pencils,” she said, hanging her coat on the chair.

“Not tonight,” he replied. “I wanted to talk instead.”

There was a weight in his tone — not heavy, but full of something unspoken.

He looked at her for a long moment before saying, “You helped me start painting again.”

Her heart fluttered. “Really?”

He nodded. “You reminded me what light feels like.”

Jenni smiled, though she felt something warm twist in her chest. “That’s funny,” she said softly. “Because you helped me finish something.”

He tilted his head. “Finish what?”

She reached into her bag and pulled out a folded page — the one she’d been working on since the day they met. She handed it to him.

It was a short story. Just a few paragraphs, but beautiful — a story about two strangers who meet in the rain, about sketches and words, about how sometimes love doesn’t start with fireworks, but with quiet light.

When he finished reading, he looked up at her. “This is us.”

She nodded. “It is.”

He reached across the table and took her hand. Outside, the rain began again — steady, rhythmic, endless.

“I don’t want this to just be a story,” he said.

Jenni squeezed his hand gently. “Then let’s write the rest together.”

The years that followed would blur — seasons changing, cafés replaced by new ones, sketches turning into paintings, short stories into novels. But neither of them ever forgot that first day — the way the rain smelled, the way light caught her hair, the way he smiled when she finally looked back.

Because sometimes, love doesn’t rush in. It drifts quietly between two souls until one day, it simply *is*.

And in that moment, sitting by the rain-streaked window, Jenni realized something she’d been writing toward all along —  
that love, like light, is never lost. It just waits to be seen.",1,1759693991.0,issheai,0,1.0,False

1nyy5vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nyy5vg/5_month_post_op_weight_and_cookbooks/,"5 month post op, weight and Cookbooks?","Hey troops,

My weight is creeping up unfortunately, im often extremly tired after meals and have a bad habit of eating too much. I loved feeling full but I realise thats a no-go now, but instead I'm getting bad for grazing instead. 

So i'm Looking for recommendations for ""no-gallbladder"" cookbooks and recipes. With a focus on meal sizes or meal prep.

What has worked for you? 
What helped you?

I had my gallbladder out in May this year so i'm a good few months down the line now. 

I'd struggled with gastric issues for a few years at that point, and even longer with ""unknown food intolerances"", best part of a decade, that i just couldnt pinpoint.

I had the first real attack in January. I mistook this for a stomach ulcer during a time of high stress and poor diet decisions. I don't think i ate for about two days and when i did i ended up throwing up real bad due to pressure in my stomach and chest. I assumed a stomach ulcer and treated it with porridge and probiotic yoghurt. But I reckon I had a stone lodged for a couple days, I felt like shit and apparently looked it... but during some physical labour at work I suddenly felt something sharp, a pain under my ribcage and something free itself. It was gone and I immedietly started feeling better. I began to suspect gallstone and wondered if that was my problem solved.

Then in May, I again made some poor food choices and spent a day with extreme gastric issues. Salad and fruit sorted me out for a short while but on the 3rd day I tried a fish pie and it had me so bloated. The pressure was unbearable. My heart was racing and I was breathing shallow, until I spent an hour throwing up. And then another 6 rolling about the floor in agony, it felt like trapped wind but the worst possible imaginable. 

I came close to calling an ambulance that night but from my experience before which was pretty similar just not quite as bad, felt that it would probably pass. So stupidly toughed it out. I would phone the Doctor in the morning.

When I did, they asked to see me, I was then referred immedietly to the hospital for tests. They took bloods while I waited, eventually many hours later i was questioned before a chest xray and a CT scan. Put in a ward and spent the next 3 days on triple antibiotics. I broke into a bit of a fever. My results had showed raised/raising bilirubin levels in my liver, which they hoped would improve but didn't. But scans hadn't shown any stones. So I was put on a stronger antibiotic and sent for an ultrasound while I was on the wait list for an MRI too. The ultrasound showed an 11mm stone trapped in transit. And after the MRI I was told I'd be having surgery to remove my gallbladder. 

Surgery went well with no real complications but according to the attendee I didn't make it easy. I assume thats because my internals were swollen and inflamed. The surgery I think, took about 3 times as long going by when I got taken in and when I got back to the ward. But thankfully it had remained keyhole and not open.

I was kept in a couple of days for observation on the drain and fluid but all seemed good. I ended up off work for another 6 weeks as its physical stuff I do.

I had lost about 2 stone in the process due to the amount of fasting I did during my hospital stay. But now, my weight is slowly creeping up. I can eat most things at this point but I struggle with some stuff. Chinese food I tend to avoid now after a couple of rough run-ins, potato salad or coleslaw, coffee first thing in the morning.

I went to a music festival in August and whilst playing it a lot safer than in the past, really struggled with bloating but wasn't sure if it was the food or alcohol, probably both tbh. I went to another much shorter festival and drank almost 100% cider and felt far better... but i did restrict my intake more and pace myself, whilst attempting to supplement with extra fruit and fibre over the few days.

But I tried alcohol again recently and it really fucked me up, my mood and energy hit rock bottom for the next 4/5 days. So the executive decision has been made, I'm off it for a good long while now. Until I can really get a better handle on my diet, as my weight is creeping up now and I need to address it.

So, again... if anyone can suggest some good cookbooks or sources for recipes. Preferably stuff I can meal prep for the week and work, help me stay full longer, not graze as much and some stuff that tickles the sweet tooth dopamine receptors. I am out and about and sometimes my job can be really physical and some days not so much. So I'm really struggling finding the balance with food and not picking something up on-the-go.

Any advice would be a great help guys.

I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

**About you:**

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*

So it seems contradictory: they’re implying I overstayed the 1-hour limit at Burger King, but the notice actually says “no valid reservation,” which sounds more like a pre-booking or pay-and-display requirement.

The next day, he was still drooping. Next day, droop. *Next* day, he’s perked up HIGH and he’s curved a bit in the stem. I walked into the room and looked at it and about had a stroke. I mean I full tism’d. 

IT GREW ROOTS.

I didn’t think there was a node on the bottom because it was a pretty clean break from the mother plant. And even if nothing happens from here, I think it was cool as fuck that he formed roots. It’s rather unheard for Monstera’s to spring roots without a node. 

Maybe there’s a tiny shred of node on the bottom.

CHANGE MY MIND.","I have a very small worm bin that is barely surviving.  One reason why I ""pulled the trigger"" and bought the container, shredded paper and worms, and tried to make it ""go"" was from reading posts in this subreddit.  Learned quite a bit both from reading here and from observation of my own bin.  As a less important example of ""what I think I know"", I do not believe that coffee grounds are good for worms, instead I think they are toxic and while worms can tolerate a small amount of coffee grounds, relative to the entire mix, I think the are overall BAD and not GOOD.  Say what you like, but I will disagree for all eternity, or at least until Jesus comes back and tells us all who really killed JFK, and why.

Meaning that, overall, while there is some good information here, some of it is bunk.  One of the primary things I remember reading 5 months ago when I was still in the planning stage of my little worm farm, was the idea that the worms would EAT the shredded paper.  Complete bullshit.  Pure fabrication.  Stop lying, etc...  I've come to the conclusion that while it's good for bedding, making a nice, loose environment for the worms to roam around in, looking for food and whatnot, there is NO eating of shredded paper taking place, and there never will be.

A close inspection of the edges of each and every piece of shredded paper shows the fibrous outline of each scrap, and there is ZERO eating going on.  And there never will be.  People should stop saying this, because it is NOT TRUE, and it will NEVER BE TRUE.  In fact, as soon as someone says that ""worms eat shredded paper"" you should automatically, reflexively and in as violent of a knee-jerk manner reject every single thing that woefully uninformed and dishonest person might say about anything else.  Because of how obviously WRONG they are about this clear and indisputable point:  WORMS DO NOT EAT PAPER.  EVER.

I see other invitations to believe in disinformation here on this subreddit, and no one seems to challenge them.  I suspect it is because the subreddit is moderated by people who make their living ""selling things"" having to do with vermiculture, and so it is in their economic best interest to allow the general public to be ignorant, uninformed and WRONG, believing in disinformation.  Because it makes other people money, that's why.  That's my conspiracy theory, and anyone that disagrees with me is WRONG.

So.  Either change my mind, or shoot me in the throat.  Those are your choices.

Oh, Also I don't believe in ""protein poisoning"".  I think that's an urban legend, a myth, and either doesn't exist in the real world, or it is so rare that anyone that mentions it is probably wrong simply based on mathematical statistics.  Reddit is a hotbed of disinformation and propaganda, and I think this whole ""protein poisoning"" thing is a very good example of the Reddit equivalent of a Facebook ""cure""; that somehow hot water and apple cider vinegar will ""melt away your belly fat"".",0,1759693194.0,Vermiculture,9,0.2,False

Atlanta is usually top of the list for us. It’s not too far from where we are, at least gets a little bit cooler, has things going on, and a major airport. Just for some background to help, we spent 5 years in a townhouse during college and post grad we loved in the heart of our midtown. Everything we really needed was within a 5’ drive from food, bars, grocery stores, gyms. We moved 3 years ago into a much bigger and older house on an acre with a pool. The essentials are all within 10’ (grocery, gas station, at least a couple decent food options, and a gym for me) and we’re still 15’ from our midtown (also where my wife’s Pilates is). My work drive is 15-25’ depending on traffic, and pretty much nothing is more than 30’ away. We’ve had issues with our house, and the amount of upkeep has frankly been a pain in my ass, and we do miss our townhouse. I’d love to go back to something similar, i think my wife will prefer something closer to a 3x3 with an enjoyable sized yard. We’d provably have $450k.

I’d like it to be somewhere that is nice and regular drives aren’t all that far (normal food, gym, groceries, coffee, etc).

1nyxsmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nyxsmo/what_to_do/,What to do,"So basically, I fell in love with her in my second year of varsity. I had been seeing her since the first year but never felt anything for her. Then one day, during an occasion at our varsity, I just realized that she is too beautiful. I told my friends, and they started calling me by her name. Suddenly, after 2–3 weeks, I developed some feelings for her. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. But after 1–1.5 months, I started feeling too much for her.

I DM’d her for the first time, just casual talking. By the way, she and I are classmates but in different sections. After a few days of talking, my feelings grew stronger. One day I asked her out for coffee, and she declined. I should have stepped back at that time, but I continued. She never gave me much priority. We might talk once a month, and those chats were always initiated by me. If I messaged her, she would reply 1–2 minutes later, or sometimes even after a day. Still, I persisted.

At the end of the year, I proposed to her and she declined. She said our caste is not similar. She was like, “You know it’s not possible.” I knew that was coming, but I still got depressed. It hampered my studies. After that incident, those few talking moments also disappeared.

I still watch her. But I know there is not a single possibility in this world that she could love me. It’s been 3 years now, and we are in our final semester, but I still love her the same as I did the first time. I can’t move on from her — or maybe I don’t want to. I don’t really know. I have around 3–4 months left until my graduation, and after that, I might lose her forever.

Sometimes I feel everything will be alright, but once I see her on campus, I can’t take my eyes away.

1nyxsep,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nyxsep/find_out_if_aieve_appliance_sliders_are_worth_it/,Find Out if Aieve Appliance Sliders Are Worth It for Your Countertop,"As someone who spends an absurd amount of time in the kitchen, surrounded by small appliances like air fryers, coffee makers, and bulky stand mixers, I thought I had seen it all. Yet, the Aieve K5032 sliders proved to be a game-changer in ways I didn’t think I needed. These tiny, round adhesive sliders are subtly brilliant, helping me manage my counter space and save my wrists from the repetitive strain of shoving heavy appliances back and forth every day.  

**Thoughtful Design and Installation**  
The round shape of these sliders combined with the self-adhesive backing makes them incredibly simple to install. I applied them to the base of my air fryer, and immediately noticed a lighter, effortless glide when repositioning it across my tile countertop. The installation was straightforward—stick and press firmly—although I did follow the advice to let them sit unused for 14 hours as the adhesive set. Bonus points for the included transparent pad that adds height and improves stickiness. It's honestly satisfying to see them blend into the appliance like they were always meant to be there.  

**Pros**  
- These sliders are made of PTFE (Teflon), ensuring a smooth surface that eliminates the risk of scratches or drag marks on countertops.  
- They excel in versatility. Whether I tested them on marble, wood, or even a cloth-covered surface, they consistently performed without slipping awkwardly or losing adhesion.  
- Applying them under different kitchen gadgets—stand mixers, coffee makers, and even my bread machine—felt like discovering a cheat code for kitchen organization.  

[Check Aieve K5032 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b08flkf9sf/)  

**Enhanced Usability for Kitchen Efficiency**  
Dragging out my stand mixer often felt like preparing for a gym session, which often led me to sideline it for quicker alternatives. These sliders have completely changed my relationship with my appliances. They allow heavy gadgets to move easily without lifting or nudging awkwardly. When cooking gets chaotic, this added mobility is a blessing, especially when every inch of counter space is precious.  

**Saving Space and Protecting Surfaces**  
One thing I noticed over time with other solutions like sliding trays or rubber mats was the limited lifespan. Trays, in particular, gave up on me after prolonged use and left messy marks. Aieve sliders performed better by barely taking up any visible room while protecting the countertop beautifully. They’ve also extended the lifespan of my appliances by preventing unnecessary tipping or awkward movement.  

**Merits**  
- Provides smooth, seamless movement for even the heaviest machines without compromising surface safety.  
- Compact and minimalist—adds functionality without being obtrusive.  

**Negatives**  
- The self-adhesive option is strong but not foolproof if placed on improperly cleaned or wet surfaces. Be meticulous while prepping the area.  
- You need to measure application points carefully, as misplacement could compromise the balance of heavier devices.  
- Waiting 14 hours for the adhesive to set is mildly annoying, especially when you need it functioning immediately.  

**Competing Products**  
Over the years, I’ve tried everything from branded sliding trays to improvised solutions like felt pads under large appliances. Compared to sliding mats, Aieve sliders feel more seamless and tailored to modern gadgets. Trays, although aesthetically pleasing, tend to take up larger counter real estate, making them slightly impractical for smaller kitchens. Similarly, mats wear down quickly under heavy usage, which isn’t an issue with these robust sliders made for long-term use.  

For anyone considering alternatives, there are silicone-based sliders available, but these tend to lose their grip over time, especially on smoother countertop surfaces like marble. The Aieve sliders stood out for their durability and consistent performance across different surfaces, something I can’t say for other brands I’ve used.  

**Quality for Price**  
Investing in small details like these might feel trivial initially, but they deliver tremendous bang for the buck in the long run. Their robust construction and self-adhesive strength make them an incredibly worthwhile addition to any kitchen setup. Instead of splashing cash on expensive countertop trays, these sliders allow a customized experience tailored to your appliance’s shape and size.

**TL;DR: Nano Banana is an incredibly versatile and powerful image model that can do way more than you think. I've compiled a list of the 10 best prompts to get you started, from turning yourself into a Pixar character to creating therapeutic art. There's also a link to a full library of 100 prompts to explore. This is your chance to level up your creative game!**

I’ve been deep-diving into Nano Banana lately, and I’m here to tell you that this model is a capable of more than you realize. Its versatility is off the charts, and the creative possibilities it unlocks are just staggering. I’ve spent a ton of time experimenting and have seen it do everything from professional graphic design to deeply personal and artistic creations.

To show you what I mean, I’ve pulled together 100 of my absolute favorite prompts that showcase just how powerful Nano Banana can be. These are designed to be helpful, inspirational, and give you a real sense of what's possible.

# Beyond Art: Real-World Use Cases

Before we dive into the prompts, let's talk about the *why*. What can you actually *do* with this? The applications are broader than you might think, and they fall into both personal and professional categories.

**For Personal Projects & Self-Exploration:** On a personal level, these prompts are a playground for self-expression. You can create professional headshots or custom avatars for your social profiles that actually look like you, design unique art for your home, or make personalized gifts for friends and family that are truly one-of-a-kind. But it can go deeper than that. Prompts like the ""Therapy for Your Inner Child"" example allow for a kind of visual journaling and self-reflection that can be genuinely powerful. It’s a new way to explore your identity, visualize your goals, and just have fun with your own image.

**For Professional Work & Creative Gigs:** In a professional context, Nano Banana is like a supercharged creative assistant. Graphic designers can use it to rapidly prototype logos and marketing materials. Architects and urban planners can visualize concepts in seconds, like turning a map view into a realistic street-level scene. Content creators can generate an endless stream of unique visuals for blog posts, social media, and presentations. It's an incredible tool for brainstorming, storyboarding, and creating polished assets without needing a massive budget or a full design team.

# The 10 Best Nano Banana Prompts to Get You Started:

1. **Pixar-Style Portrait:** Ever wanted to see yourself as a Pixar character? This prompt does it flawlessly. Just provide a reference image, and it will generate a high-quality, 3D avatar with that classic, heartwarming Pixar vibe. PROMPT - `3D avatar of the young man in the image attached, smiling happily, clean white background, conceptual digital art in Pixar-style, high quality, soft lighting, smooth textures, vibrant colors, realistic proportions with a cartoon touch & studio render look.`
2. **Therapy for Your Inner Child:** This one is incredibly powerful. You give it a reference portrait, and it creates a photorealistic image of you as an adult sitting next to your younger self in a therapy room. It's a profound and moving way to visualize self-healing. PROMPT - `Photorealistic minimalist therapy room; light walls, grey sofa, wooden coffee table with a tissue box, notebook and a glass of water, simple frame and floor lamp, soft natural daylight. The same person at two ages sits side-by-side: adult on the left speaking with open hands; child on the right listening with head slightly down. Both wear matching [OUTFIT] (same color & style). Clean studio vibe, centered composition, shallow depth of field, 50mm look, 4K, vertical 3:4. No extra people, no text, no watermark.`
3. **Turn Illustrations into Action Figures:** Have a favorite drawing or character? This prompt transforms it into a realistic-looking character figure, complete with a display box and a computer in the background showing the 3D modeling process. PROMPT - `turn this photo into a character figure. Behind it, place a box with the character's image printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, add a round plastic base with the character figure standing on it. set the scene indoors if possible`
4. **Generate a Real-World View from a Map:** This is some next-level stuff. Input a Google Maps image with a red arrow, and this prompt will generate what that arrow is seeing in the real world. The potential for this is huge!  PROMPT - `draw what the red arrow sees / draw the real world view from the red circle in the direction of the arrow.`
5. **Create Your Own AR Experience:** Turn any image into an Augmented Reality experience. This prompt acts as a location-based AR generator, highlighting and annotating points of interest in your photo. PROMPT - `you are a location-based AR experience generator. highlight [point of interest] in this image and annotate relevant information about it.`
6. **Photos of Yourself in Different Eras:** Want to see what you’d look like in the 70s? Or the 40s? This prompt takes a photo and transforms your style, hair, and background to match any era you specify.  PROMPT - `Change the characer's style to [1970]'s classical [male] style. Add [long curly] hair, and change the background to a [1970]'s classical building. Ensure the photo quality appears as if it were taken in the [1970]s.`
7. **Coloring a Line Art Image:** Perfect for artists and creators. This prompt takes a line art image and colors it in, making it look like it's being digitally drawn on a tablet. You can even specify how much of the coloring is complete. PROMPT - `The attached line art is being colored in on a tablet with a digital pen. The background is a simple desk. Parts of the line art have been colored with the same coloring as the original image. Unfinished coloring. Must not be monochrome. About 70% of the coloring is done. Close-up. The pen tip is touching the tablet screen.`
8. **Generate Character Expressions for LINE Stamps:** If you're into creating your own emojis or stickers, this prompt is for you. It takes a character reference and generates a full sheet of facial expressions—joy, anger, sadness, you name it. PROMPT - `Character sheet, facial expressions, joy, anger, sadness, happiness`
9. **Extract 3D Buildings for Isometric Models:** For the architects and designers out there. This prompt takes an image of a building, makes it daytime, and turns it into an isometric model, focusing only on the specified object. PROMPT - `Make Image Daytime and Isometric [Building Only]`
10. **Recreate a Photo in a Different Style:** This is where you can really let your creativity run wild. Provide a photo and a style reference (like a Van Gogh painting), and Nano Banana will recreate your image in that exact style.  PROMPT - `Recreate this photo in the style of [Van Gogh]`

We started running next to each other and chatting anytime we were both at the run club. She knows I am married (she is single). She added me on Instagram and started reacting to my stories and sending me short messages. 

She's 27 and I'm 30 and I started to develop feelings for her. I invited her out for coffees and a walk and she went on it with me. I told her about my situation and how my wife and I have lost our spark. For some reason I didn't have the balls to ask her if she would be open to being my AP. I even messed up and said I want to do things ""the right way"" if I get divorced and wouldn't want to have an affair. I don't know why I said this... I got nervous and I guess I was feeling insecure and didn't want her to judge me. Anyways we talked for a couple hours about our life's stories and the walk overall went pretty well. 

I'm wondering if she was ever actually interested in me or if she was just being nice in going for a walk. I definitely know I messed up telling her I didn't want an affair. I also never told her I have feelings for her. We texted back and forth a bit after this but pretty soon after she stopped responding. 

Was she just being nice in going for a walk with me? Or did the fact that she agreed to go for a walk mean that she was likely open to something and was waiting for me to be direct? 

I think what I told her must have confused her because it was pretty obvious I was interested in her and then I told her I wanted to do things ""the right way"" (lie) and not start an affair until I cut things off with my wife (which I know I can't do for a long time). 

Anyways, I'm new to all of this and I'm just looking for suggestions on how to ask someone like her if she would be open to an affair without her freaking out and blowing up my life...

I've been wondering this for ages and thought id propose it as a question.  
   
To clarify, I'm specifically talking about the 60% of Americans who live in suburbia. Obviously, with the oppression of the highway acts and segregation, and privatization of social spaces, and removal of third places to optimize consumption, they are forced to drive everywhere. That already removes walking to the store or work, or commuting to work (assuming they use the car radio). 

So what remains is those privatized social spaces, such as McDonald's which urges it's customers out with oppressive floor design and minimal seating, not to mention focusing in drive-thrus (same for their coffee shops)! The only remaining use cases that comes to mind is specifically gyms (and likewise health establishments, or alternatively being at home, but at that stage the selling point of them being small isn't applicable and over head headphones make more sense. The final one that comes to mind is school, which is honestly the most sound case use scenario, but what about those over 21? 

I understand this is a very touchy subject for Americans and I hope my genuine curiosity is understood. i've visited urban areas in America, and the main usage was similar to here in Europe, i.e commuting. I just struggle to understand the remainder of the nation.

38M, 160lbs at 6ft, no smoking/drinking/coffee, nothing of note in health, medicines, etc. Pretty normal and healthy, eat petty well, whole food multivitamin if day's meals not that good, fairly sedentary and bit low on exercise.

Have a round black spot on my right toenail on the lower bottom corner. No pain as I'm aware, no unique pain or discomfort if I press on it. I saw it 3 days after returning from a trip with my girlfriend. On the last day of the trip, she crawled past me in bed and her shin pinched down this toenail and it kind of hurt but it wasn't that bad - I was more concerned that she could have landed on the top left edge of the nail, which was stinging from what must have been a sharp edge growing in.

After getting home, I cut the part of the nail that was hurting me and I didn't see the spot, so it could only have appeared 2-3 days after the incident, with no sign within 2 days of the incident. So I don't know if they're related or not.

Pictures in comments.

1) If it's just blood, what should I watch for and expect over how much time?

2) If I don't mind scheduling a regular doctor's visit earlier to avoid risking something bad growing longer, how soon should I stop waiting for better signs? It's already been 16 days.

3) What sort of doctor should I look for? BONUS Q: What sort of doctor would I look for since I'm living in HCMC, Vietnam?

Built an n8n workflow for $0.73/month that processes everything in 4 seconds. My accountant thinks I'm lying.","Replaced our $2,400/month VA who manually entered invoices into spreadsheets with a fully automated n8n workflow. Now invoice PDFs dropped in Google Drive get extracted, logged, and the billing team gets notified—all in under 4 seconds. Total cost: $0.73/month for OpenAI API calls. 6 weeks in, zero errors, saved 47 hours already.



Hey r/Entrepreneur,

So this is going to sound stupidly specific, but maybe some of you are dealing with the same nightmare I was.

Our company (small landscaping operation, 23 employees) was getting absolutely crushed by invoices. Suppliers, contractors, equipment rentals—you name it. Every. Single. Day. My inbox looked like a warzone, and our ""system"" was basically:

1. Print the PDF
2. Stare at it
3. Manually type everything into a Google Sheet
4. Email the team
5. File it somewhere
6. Forget where you filed it
7. Panic during tax season

I hired a part-time VA for $15/hour (about 160 hours/month) to handle this. She was great, but it was costing us $2,400/month, and she'd still occasionally miss invoices or typo a number. Not her fault—it's mind-numbing work.

One Sunday at 2am (after my third beer and a particularly annoying week where we almost missed a payment), I decided to figure out if I could automate this shit.

**The Numbers (Last 6 Weeks):**

* **Invoices processed:** 1,273 (vs \~0 that I'd personally touch before)
* **Average processing time:** 3.7 seconds (vs 8-12 minutes manually)
* **Extraction accuracy:** 98.9% (we spot-check weekly)
* **Total cost:** $4.38 in OpenAI API usage (vs $14,400 for VA over same period)
* **Hours saved:** \~47 hours of human time
* **Errors/missed invoices:** 0 (vs 3-4/month with manual process)
* **Time to build:** 6 hours total (mostly because I'm an idiot and forgot to enable API access)
* **ROI payback period:** Literally the first day

**Tech Stack:**

* **n8n** (self-hosted on a $6/month DigitalOcean droplet—could use free cloud version too)
* **Google Drive API** (free)
* **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** ($0.15 per 1M input tokens—absurdly cheap for this)
* **Google Sheets API** (free)
* **Gmail API** (free)

**Total monthly cost: \~$6.73**

(For reference: There are free alternatives like Make.com's free tier or Zapier if you're under certain task limits, but n8n gives you unlimited everything if self-hosted)

**How It Actually Works:**

The whole thing is stupid simple once you see it:

1. **Invoice PDF drops into specific Google Drive folder** → n8n workflow triggers
2. **Downloads the file** → Extracts text from PDF using built-in node
3. **GPT-4o-mini reads the extracted text** → Pulls out: Invoice #, Client Name, Email, Address, Phone, Amount, Invoice Date, Due Date
4. **Appends everything to Google Sheet** → Our ""Invoice Database"" (fancy name for a spreadsheet)
5. **GPT generates a notification email** → Sends to [billing@example.com](mailto:billing@example.com) with summary and link to sheet
6. **Done** → Billing team gets notified, everything's logged, I drink my coffee in peace

The whole thing runs without me touching it. At all.

**What It CAN Do:**

* Process any standard invoice format (PDFs, even shitty scanned ones)
* Extract data with scary-good accuracy (GPT-4o-mini is weirdly perfect for this)
* Handle multiple invoices simultaneously
* Maintain a searchable database of every invoice you've ever received
* Send smart notifications to your team
* Run 24/7 without complaining or taking vacation days

**What It CAN'T Do:**

* Handle invoices written in crayon by your drunk uncle (OCR has limits)
* Make strategic decisions about which invoices to dispute
* Replace human judgment calls on weird edge cases (we get maybe 2-3 weird ones per month that need manual review)

**ROI Breakdown (Year 1):**

* VA cost eliminated: $28,800
* Time saved (47 hrs × $50/hr blended rate): $2,350
* Late payment fees avoided (we had 2 last quarter): \~$400
* My sanity: Priceless
* **Setup cost:** \~$80 (my time at $13/hour because I was learning)
* **Annual operating cost:** \~$80

**Total Year 1 value: \~$31,470**

Not bad for a Sunday night project.

**Build Process:**

For anyone technical, here's what it actually took:

    Hour 1-2: Set up n8n, connect Google Drive
    Hour 2-3: Figure out PDF text extraction 
    Hour 3-4: Configure OpenAI node (got stuck on API key issues like a moron)
    Hour 4-5: Build Google Sheets integration
    Hour 5-6: Set up email notifications, test everything 10 times
    Total: 6 hours

Skill level: If you can follow a YouTube tutorial and have basic tech literacy, you can build this. I'm not a developer—I'm a guy who Googles error messages.

**5 Lessons I Learned:**

1. **AI for data extraction is criminally underused.** GPT-4o-mini costs basically nothing and is 10x better than any regex pattern or traditional OCR I tried.
2. **Start with your most annoying task, not your most important one.** This wasn't ""mission-critical"" but it freed up so much mental space.
3. **Self-hosting n8n is easier than you think.** One-click deploy on DigitalOcean. Done in 10 minutes.
4. **You don't need perfect data extraction.** 98.9% accuracy means we spot-check a few invoices weekly. That's 2 minutes vs. 160 hours. I'll take it.
5. **The real cost of manual work isn't just money—it's the context switching.** Every time someone had to manually enter an invoice, they lost 20 minutes of focus on actual work.

**The Give:**

I'm not selling anything here (mods, please don't kill me). I'm just a dude who's unreasonably excited about this.

If anyone wants the complete n8n workflow JSON, I'll post it. You can literally import it and swap in your own API keys/folders. Should take you 30 minutes to get running.

Also happy to answer questions about the setup, costs, or how we handle edge cases. I've probably screwed this up in ways I haven't discovered yet, so if you see issues, call them out.

If there's enough interest, I'll make a quick video walkthrough of the whole setup.

**My question for you:** What's the most annoying manual process in your business that you keep putting off automating? I'm curious if there are other stupid-simple wins like this that people are sleeping on.",0,1759692383.0,SaaS,0,0.33,False

1nyxd8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nyxd8n/my_manipulative_ex_sent_me_a_box_full_of/,"My manipulative ex sent me a box full of apologies five years after we broke up. The problem is, she died a year ago.","It’s been five years. Five years since I finally, painfully, and messily, extracted myself from that relationship. It was one of those relationships that doesn’t just end; it leaves a crater. She was my first real love, and she was a master of a quiet, insidious kind of cruelty. A manipulator of the highest order. Every argument was my fault. Every insecurity I had was a weapon she would sharpen and use against me. By the end, I was a hollowed-out, anxious wreck of a person. It took me years of therapy, of rebuilding my own self-worth from the ground up, to feel even remotely normal again. I hadn’t seen or spoken to her in half a decade. I thought I was free.

Then, last month, the box arrived.

It was a small, unassuming package in my mailbox. No return address. Just my name and address, written in a familiar, elegant, sharp cursive that I recognized instantly. A cold, heavy feeling, a ghost of an old anxiety, settled in my stomach. Her handwriting.

On a small, cardboard tag tied to the box with a black ribbon, were seven words, also in her hand: “For all the things I should have said.”

My first instinct was to throw it away, unopened. To just toss it in the dumpster and pretend it never came. But I couldn’t. The curiosity, the morbid need for a final, long-overdue sense of closure, was too strong. I took it inside.

The box itself was beautiful. It was a small, ornate thing, carved from a dark, heavy wood, with intricate patterns of vines and leaves winding around its sides. It felt old, ancient even. I sat at my kitchen table, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs, and I lifted the lid.

Inside, the box was empty.

It was lined with a deep, dark, light-absorbing velvet. There was no letter, no trinket, no explanation. Just an empty, velvet-lined box. I felt a surge of frustrated, familiar anger. Of course. Even now, five years later, she was still playing games. Sending a cryptic, beautiful, and ultimately empty gesture. It was so perfectly her.

I put the box on a bookshelf in my living room, a strange, dark little monument to a past I was trying to forget, and I did my best to put it out of my mind.

The next morning, I was getting ready for work. I walked past the bookshelf, and something caught my eye. There was a small, folded piece of white paper sitting in the center of the box’s dark velvet lining.

I froze. I knew, with an absolute certainty, that the box had been empty when I went to bed. My apartment door was locked. No one had been in. My hands were trembling as I reached for it.

I unfolded the paper. On it, in that same, sharp, elegant cursive, was a single sentence.

“I’m sorry for making you feel small at that dinner party with your friends.”

I stared at the note, my mind reeling. The dinner party. It had been seven years ago. A small gathering at my apartment. She had spent the entire night subtly, skillfully, undermining me in front of my oldest friends, making me the butt of a dozen “gentle” jokes that left me feeling like an idiot. I had almost forgotten about it. But the apology… it was so specific. So verbatim to the conversation we’d had in the car on the way home, where I had used those exact words: “You made me feel small.”

I spent the rest of the day in a daze, the note folded in my pocket, a strange, hot coal against my leg. When I got home from work, I went straight to the bookshelf.

There was another note.

“I’m sorry for reading your journal.”

My blood ran cold. She had always sworn she hadn’t. It had been a huge fight, a suspicion I could never prove. But here it was. A confession. A posthumous admission of guilt.

I checked again an hour later. Another note.

“I’m sorry for lying about where I was that night.”

This was the rhythm of my life for the next week. The box became an endless, automated apology machine. Every time I looked, a new note, a new folded piece of paper, a new shard of our toxic past, would be waiting for me. At first, it was… cathartic. Validating. Every note was a confirmation that I hadn’t been crazy. The gaslighting, the manipulation, it had all been real. It was like all the old wounds I had were finally being lanced, the poison drained away.

“I’m sorry I told your mother you were the one who broke her antique vase.”
“I’m sorry I flirted with your best friend at your birthday party.”
“I’m sorry I made you quit your painting class.”

But then, the apologies started to get darker. More intrusive.

“I’m sorry for watching you while you slept.”

I found that one on a Saturday morning. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. I remembered waking up sometimes, in the dead of night, with the feeling of being watched, only to see her lying beside me, her eyes closed. I had always dismissed it as a dream.

“I’m sorry for putting that keylogger on your laptop.”

That one explained so much. The way she always seemed to know what I was thinking, who I was talking to. The way she would bring up things from private emails, pretending it was just a lucky guess.

“I’m sorry I followed you to work that day you said you were sick.”

The box wasn’t just apologizing for the things I knew about. It was revealing a secret, hidden history of stalking and violation, a level of obsession and control that I had never even suspected. The catharsis was curdling into a deep, creeping horror. It was an invasion. A re-opening of a past that was far more monstrous than I had ever realized.

I had to get rid of it.

I took the box, my hands shaking with a mixture of fear and rage, and I threw it in the dumpster behind my apartment building. I watched it disappear under a pile of trash bags. I felt a sense of finality, of relief.

The next morning, it was back on my bookshelf.

It was sitting in the exact same spot, polished and pristine. And inside, a new note was waiting.

“I’m sorry you tried to throw me away.”

Panic, a raw, frantic, animal panic, began to set in. I took the box out to my small concrete patio and I took a hammer to it. I swung with all my might. The hammer head connected with the dark wood with a loud CRACK… and bounced off, leaving not so much as a scratch. The wood was impossibly, unnaturally hard. The hammer, however, had a new dent in its head.

The box was a part of my life now. An unmovable, unbreakable, and unending source of my past’s poison.

And then, the apologies started to change. They started to become… predictive.

One morning, a note appeared that was different. It was about the future.

“I’m sorry for what the man on the bus is about to say to you.”

I stared at the note, a sense of profound, dizzying wrongness washing over me. An hour later, on my commute to work, the bus lurched, and a large, angry-looking man stumbled and spilled his coffee. He turned and glared at me, even though I was a full three feet away. “Watch where you’re going, you idiot,” he snarled, his voice full of a bizarre, unearned venom.

The box wasn’t just dredging up the past anymore. It was predicting, or maybe even causing, new negativity in my life, and then apologizing for it.

The notes became a mix of past and present.

“I’m sorry I dented your father’s car and let you take the blame.”
“I’m sorry for the flat tire you’re going to get this afternoon.”
“I’m sorry I told all our friends your novel was just a stupid hobby.”
“I’m sorry your boss is going to lose that important file.”

It was a constant, unending stream of misery, both remembered and newly delivered. I was living in a psychic minefield, with the box as my own personal, malevolent fortune teller.

I had to talk to her. I had to stop this. I dug through my old contacts, my fingers feeling like clumsy sausages, and I found her number. I hadn’t deleted it. I just… never looked at it. I called. It went straight to a disconnected tone.

I tried her social media. Her profiles were all gone. Deactivated.

I was getting desperate. I called one of our old, mutual friends, someone I hadn’t spoken to in years.

“Hey,” I said, my voice shaking. “This is going to sound really, really weird. But I need to get in touch with her. It’s an emergency. Do you have a new number for her?”

There was a long, heavy silence on the other end of the line.

“Are you… are you okay?” my old friend finally asked, his voice full of a strange, cautious concern.

“Yeah, I’m fine, I just… I really need to talk to her.”

Another pause. “Dude,” he said, his voice soft. “She’s dead. She died a year ago.”

The phone slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. I just stood there, the blood roaring in my ears. Dead. She was dead.

“A car accident,” my friend’s tinny voice continued from the floor. “It was really awful. I thought you knew. Her parents sent out an announcement.”

I hung up. She was dead. For a year. But the box… the box had arrived a month ago. And the notes… they were still coming.

I stumbled to the bookshelf. The box was there, a dark, silent void. And inside, a new, folded note. I picked it up with a hand that was so numb I could barely feel the paper.

“I’m sorry I died.”

My mind shattered. The last, fragile barrier between the rational world and this impossible, waking nightmare dissolved completely. This wasn’t a sick prank. This wasn’t a final, manipulative game. This was something else. Something from beyond the grave.

I’m writing this now because I don’t know what else to do. I am trapped. The notes haven’t stopped. But they’re different now. They’re no longer just apologies for the life we shared. They’re… dispatches. Postcards from whatever hell she’s in. And they are more terrifying than any of her earthly cruelties.

This morning, there were three.

“I’m sorry I was thinking of you when I died. I was holding this box.”

That one made me physically ill. I was the last thought in her head. And somehow, in that final moment, she had tethered this… this thing to me.

1nyxcvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nyxcvm/my_manipulative_ex_sent_me_a_box_full_of/,"My manipulative ex sent me a box full of apologies five years after we broke up. The problem is, she died a year ago.","It’s been five years. Five years since I finally, painfully, and messily, extracted myself from that relationship. It was one of those relationships that doesn’t just end; it leaves a crater. She was my first real love, and she was a master of a quiet, insidious kind of cruelty. A manipulator of the highest order. Every argument was my fault. Every insecurity I had was a weapon she would sharpen and use against me. By the end, I was a hollowed-out, anxious wreck of a person. It took me years of therapy, of rebuilding my own self-worth from the ground up, to feel even remotely normal again. I hadn’t seen or spoken to her in half a decade. I thought I was free.

Then, last month, the box arrived.

It was a small, unassuming package in my mailbox. No return address. Just my name and address, written in a familiar, elegant, sharp cursive that I recognized instantly. A cold, heavy feeling, a ghost of an old anxiety, settled in my stomach. Her handwriting.

On a small, cardboard tag tied to the box with a black ribbon, were seven words, also in her hand: “For all the things I should have said.”

My first instinct was to throw it away, unopened. To just toss it in the dumpster and pretend it never came. But I couldn’t. The curiosity, the morbid need for a final, long-overdue sense of closure, was too strong. I took it inside.

The box itself was beautiful. It was a small, ornate thing, carved from a dark, heavy wood, with intricate patterns of vines and leaves winding around its sides. It felt old, ancient even. I sat at my kitchen table, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs, and I lifted the lid.

Inside, the box was empty.

It was lined with a deep, dark, light-absorbing velvet. There was no letter, no trinket, no explanation. Just an empty, velvet-lined box. I felt a surge of frustrated, familiar anger. Of course. Even now, five years later, she was still playing games. Sending a cryptic, beautiful, and ultimately empty gesture. It was so perfectly her.

I put the box on a bookshelf in my living room, a strange, dark little monument to a past I was trying to forget, and I did my best to put it out of my mind.

The next morning, I was getting ready for work. I walked past the bookshelf, and something caught my eye. There was a small, folded piece of white paper sitting in the center of the box’s dark velvet lining.

I froze. I knew, with an absolute certainty, that the box had been empty when I went to bed. My apartment door was locked. No one had been in. My hands were trembling as I reached for it.

I unfolded the paper. On it, in that same, sharp, elegant cursive, was a single sentence.

“I’m sorry for making you feel small at that dinner party with your friends.”

I stared at the note, my mind reeling. The dinner party. It had been seven years ago. A small gathering at my apartment. She had spent the entire night subtly, skillfully, undermining me in front of my oldest friends, making me the butt of a dozen “gentle” jokes that left me feeling like an idiot. I had almost forgotten about it. But the apology… it was so specific. So verbatim to the conversation we’d had in the car on the way home, where I had used those exact words: “You made me feel small.”

I spent the rest of the day in a daze, the note folded in my pocket, a strange, hot coal against my leg. When I got home from work, I went straight to the bookshelf.

There was another note.

“I’m sorry for reading your journal.”

My blood ran cold. She had always sworn she hadn’t. It had been a huge fight, a suspicion I could never prove. But here it was. A confession. A posthumous admission of guilt.

I checked again an hour later. Another note.

“I’m sorry for lying about where I was that night.”

This was the rhythm of my life for the next week. The box became an endless, automated apology machine. Every time I looked, a new note, a new folded piece of paper, a new shard of our toxic past, would be waiting for me. At first, it was… cathartic. Validating. Every note was a confirmation that I hadn’t been crazy. The gaslighting, the manipulation, it had all been real. It was like all the old wounds I had were finally being lanced, the poison drained away.

“I’m sorry I told your mother you were the one who broke her antique vase.”
“I’m sorry I flirted with your best friend at your birthday party.”
“I’m sorry I made you quit your painting class.”

But then, the apologies started to get darker. More intrusive.

“I’m sorry for watching you while you slept.”

I found that one on a Saturday morning. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. I remembered waking up sometimes, in the dead of night, with the feeling of being watched, only to see her lying beside me, her eyes closed. I had always dismissed it as a dream.

“I’m sorry for putting that keylogger on your laptop.”

That one explained so much. The way she always seemed to know what I was thinking, who I was talking to. The way she would bring up things from private emails, pretending it was just a lucky guess.

“I’m sorry I followed you to work that day you said you were sick.”

The box wasn’t just apologizing for the things I knew about. It was revealing a secret, hidden history of stalking and violation, a level of obsession and control that I had never even suspected. The catharsis was curdling into a deep, creeping horror. It was an invasion. A re-opening of a past that was far more monstrous than I had ever realized.

I had to get rid of it.

I took the box, my hands shaking with a mixture of fear and rage, and I threw it in the dumpster behind my apartment building. I watched it disappear under a pile of trash bags. I felt a sense of finality, of relief.

The next morning, it was back on my bookshelf.

It was sitting in the exact same spot, polished and pristine. And inside, a new note was waiting.

“I’m sorry you tried to throw me away.”

Panic, a raw, frantic, animal panic, began to set in. I took the box out to my small concrete patio and I took a hammer to it. I swung with all my might. The hammer head connected with the dark wood with a loud CRACK… and bounced off, leaving not so much as a scratch. The wood was impossibly, unnaturally hard. The hammer, however, had a new dent in its head.

The box was a part of my life now. An unmovable, unbreakable, and unending source of my past’s poison.

And then, the apologies started to change. They started to become… predictive.

One morning, a note appeared that was different. It was about the future.

“I’m sorry for what the man on the bus is about to say to you.”

I stared at the note, a sense of profound, dizzying wrongness washing over me. An hour later, on my commute to work, the bus lurched, and a large, angry-looking man stumbled and spilled his coffee. He turned and glared at me, even though I was a full three feet away. “Watch where you’re going, you idiot,” he snarled, his voice full of a bizarre, unearned venom.

The box wasn’t just dredging up the past anymore. It was predicting, or maybe even causing, new negativity in my life, and then apologizing for it.

The notes became a mix of past and present.

“I’m sorry I dented your father’s car and let you take the blame.”
“I’m sorry for the flat tire you’re going to get this afternoon.”
“I’m sorry I told all our friends your novel was just a stupid hobby.”
“I’m sorry your boss is going to lose that important file.”

It was a constant, unending stream of misery, both remembered and newly delivered. I was living in a psychic minefield, with the box as my own personal, malevolent fortune teller.

I had to talk to her. I had to stop this. I dug through my old contacts, my fingers feeling like clumsy sausages, and I found her number. I hadn’t deleted it. I just… never looked at it. I called. It went straight to a disconnected tone.

I tried her social media. Her profiles were all gone. Deactivated.

I was getting desperate. I called one of our old, mutual friends, someone I hadn’t spoken to in years.

“Hey,” I said, my voice shaking. “This is going to sound really, really weird. But I need to get in touch with her. It’s an emergency. Do you have a new number for her?”

There was a long, heavy silence on the other end of the line.

“Are you… are you okay?” my old friend finally asked, his voice full of a strange, cautious concern.

“Yeah, I’m fine, I just… I really need to talk to her.”

Another pause. “Dude,” he said, his voice soft. “She’s dead. She died a year ago.”

The phone slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor. I just stood there, the blood roaring in my ears. Dead. She was dead.

“A car accident,” my friend’s tinny voice continued from the floor. “It was really awful. I thought you knew. Her parents sent out an announcement.”

I hung up. She was dead. For a year. But the box… the box had arrived a month ago. And the notes… they were still coming.

I stumbled to the bookshelf. The box was there, a dark, silent void. And inside, a new, folded note. I picked it up with a hand that was so numb I could barely feel the paper.

“I’m sorry I died.”

My mind shattered. The last, fragile barrier between the rational world and this impossible, waking nightmare dissolved completely. This wasn’t a sick prank. This wasn’t a final, manipulative game. This was something else. Something from beyond the grave.

I’m writing this now because I don’t know what else to do. I am trapped. The notes haven’t stopped. But they’re different now. They’re no longer just apologies for the life we shared. They’re… dispatches. Postcards from whatever hell she’s in. And they are more terrifying than any of her earthly cruelties.

This morning, there were three.

“I’m sorry I was thinking of you when I died. I was holding this box.”

That one made me physically ill. I was the last thought in her head. And somehow, in that final moment, she had tethered this… this thing to me.

“I’m sorry the sky is red here.”

“I’m sorry the people here don’t have hearts. They just have empty spaces.”

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (I'll call him John for the sake of the post- like John Doe) since mid-late February. Everything was beyond amazing for the first two ish months, and then little things started happening, that gradually escalated. I can't even count how many times we've broken up for a few days and gotten back together. 

Before immediately saying ""if you're on and off you should just break up"", listen. All of the issues we're facing started around the same time: when his doctor switched his ADHD medications, and started him on antidepressants. When he started on those meds, he CHANGED. He wasn't his usual happy self, he was angry all the time, he stopped hanging out with his friends. He only ever spent time with me, and we were often having disagreements (which, I will be honest, he usually started). 

The ADHD meds he was (and still is) on, come with a risk of causing manic episodes in people who have or are at risk of bipolar disorder. Guess what! He has bipolar disorder. And on top of that, being put on antidepressants as an individual with bipolar disorder is literally NOT RECOMMENDED by doctors!!! Because it also can cause manic episodes!!! (I have no clue what his doctor was thinking- I think the biggest issue is that the doctor prescribing him ISN'T EVEN A PSYCHIATRIST- ugh. anyway.)

He's caused a lot of fights between us, and he struggles with communicating healthily (we're both on the spectrum), which leads to a lot of misunderstandings, but of course we're both very stubborn people and rarely ever agree to disagree. 

Enough about him though, here's what's up with me: 
I moved out of my family's house a month and a half into our relationship because of mental, emotional and verbal abuse at home. I've been struggling with depression ever since my mom passed away from a drug overdose in May of 2022. I have no formal diagnoses at all whatsoever, but my therapist has said that I' definitely struggling with depression, she has concerns of ADHD and anxiety, and I've had some of my friends' moms (who have daughters eith borderline personality disorder) tell me that they see a lot of traits of it in me, and my mom had bipolar disorder and so does my dad, which puts me at a higher risk of also having that. 95% of my friends are on the spectrum because I literally cannot get along well with people who are neurotypical, and I have a LOT of similarities to my autistic friends, and many of them have said i'm most likely on the spectrum as well (I've also had family members say I probably have it too). I got a lot going on. 

Now, I'm not gonna say that my boyfriend is the only person in the relationship who has made mistakes. I have too. And I might be wrong, maybe it's the depression and low self worth talking, but the way I see it, all of the problems we have started after I did something he didn't like. 

For instance: We had another one of our breakups, but this time it was different. He was talking about finding someone new, and encouraged me to do the same. So, me, having over 400 people on Snap at the time (I don't know why I added so many people I will be so honest I have long since unadded all of the randoms), found a hookup within minutes. I didn't tell him about it, because the way I saw it, we had broken up and it didn't seem like we would get back together because he LITERALLY SAID HE WANTES TO FIND SOMEONE NEW (I apologize for yelling, this man confuses me deeply at times).

Well, when I did eventually tell him, a few weeks later after we had gotten back together (AND I HAD STOPPED TALKING TO THE GUY, IT WAS A HOOKUP AND THAT WAS IT), he said I cheated on him. Now, I can't invalidate his feelings, he felt cheated on and I can't change that. But he's told people I cheated... without telling the full story. Which is annoying. And MY DUMBASS. DIDN'T LEARN. and did this two other times with other guys (I should add, protected, I am clean and healthy). It's caused a lot of issues between us. And with other people, I will say (one of my hookups miiighhttvvee led to an entire friend group falling apart but we don't talk about that, he had it coming). I don't exactly know where I'm going with this, but like. To quote Doja Cat's ""Ain't Shit"", ""THATS NOT CHEATING IF I WASNT WITH YO ASS"" anyways. That's how I see it. He sees it differently. And we have since talked about how I believe that the moment you break up with someone you can do whatever the hell you want, if you don't want to take time to get over someone, that's your choice (also usually my choice). But he said ""We had JUST broken up, and it still felt, to me, like we were in a talking stage of sorts, and we did get back together, so it felt like cheating to me."" I can't argue with that, but also. Like I said before. ""THATS NOT CHEATING IF I WASNT WITH YO ASS."" I need to stop lmfao.

Well, because of all of my stupid actions, he has Trust Issues with me. But those trust issues went from asking me to be honest about it, to going through my phone and forcing me to block guys (that i never had any intention ever of ever going beyond friends/ acquaintances with), and even telling me that I couldn't have a sleepover with one of my girl friends. AKA, in my eyes, he's getting a wee bit controlling. He even said that I couldn't sing at an after school coffee house event because ""If you seem all weird and boring, no one will want you and I can have you all to myself"". 🤨🥲. He's told me to take certain videos off my Tiktok because ""they make it seem like you're advertising to guys"". 🤨🥲. 

Now, another thing. There has been a VERY unfair power dynamic in this relationship. There have been COUNTLESS times, where I've tried to explain to him the way I see things- and he'll shut me down and enforce his opinion on the matter. Or just flip out on me for the littlest things. He also, does not have a therapist, and was taught by his father that it makes you weak to show your emotions. So after however long of bottling it up, he'll explode and say the most horrendous things to me, but later he'll spam call me crying and apologizing. And I forgive him every time because I know his medication is the main thing causing his outbursts, because THEY NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE THEY PUT HIM ON THESE MEDS. EVEN HIS MOTHER AND HIS FRIENDS THAT HAVE KNOWN HIM LONGER THAN I HAVE, HAVE CONFIRMED THAT, SO IT IS NOT HIM JUST ""showing his true colours"". THANK YOU.

He has an appointment with an actual psychiatrist this month (yay, he'll actually get proper medication that won't make him an angry douchebag anymore (I will add he calls himself that, I'm not just being mean)). I also, have an appointment with a psychiatrist in a few weeks, so hopefully I can actually get assessments and proper diagnoses, and medications so I'm not the emotional rollercoaster that I am 24/7.

Okay this post is getting really long and I'm gonna flat out ask my question from the title again. 

Do I take a break, until he gets on better medication and regulates on them, where we Do Not Hang Out, Do Not Call At Night, and Do Not Do Anything Beyond The Occasional Hug, or do I leave completely (I will be so honest even if every single comment tells me to leave him I won't 💀🤪), or do I just wait it out and try and develop coping mechanisms and better boundaries and communication skills with him so that we can work through everything just in case medication doesn't help (I will say this is what he's already trying to do, but I will need more advice on what type of boundaries and communication skills to work on)

TL;DR: my boyfriend and I both have a lot of mental issues and although we both have meetings with psychiatrists coming up this month, I'm debating between taking a break or waiting it out and trying to work on healthier boundaries and better communication.

Hey everyone,  
So I’ve been thinking about trying to ask a few girls (around 18–20) out this Saturday—nothing crazy, just something chill like coffee, a walk, or hanging out somewhere casual. I’m not trying to be weird or pushy, just looking to vibe and see where it goes.

Any advice on how to approach this naturally without coming off as awkward or overly forward? Also, what kind of spots or vibes do girls usually appreciate for a first casual link-up these days?

Appreciate any tips!
im 20 btw

Specifically, I am having terrible diarrhea. I have tried taking Imodium which helps, but it does not seem sustainable as I would need to take numerous Imodium pills weekly for it to fix the issue. I have also tried a fiber supplement which hasn't made much of a difference. It may be worth noting that I have IBS, but this is much worse than usual. Drinking coffee seems to make the issue worse?

Does anyone have any advice? The medication has been working, l've lost 8-9lbs and am noticeably less hungry. However these side effects feel unsustainable as they are affecting both my social life and my work life. I am uncomfortable going anywhere without access to a bathroom.

Is it worth it to continue the medication?",1,1759691882.0,CompoundedSemaglutide,8,1.0,False

Since then, he said he's ""trying"", and he is, and why can't I accept it?","I've been dating this guy since november last year after we dated casually and broke up last spring. In mid august this year (8 months into the relationship) I opened a conversation with my bf about how I want more reciprocation in how we connect. Somehow the conversation led to him saying he's having a hard time seeing a future with me. 

Of course my heart instantly broke. He and i are idiots i guess and didn't break up right then. All he said is that ""he'd try harder."" I've had a string of family emergencies so I've been avoiding breaking up with him for my own sake and just took his word. I still don't know what ""trying harder"" means for him.

He *has* been trying more things for our relationship, but in a very clumsy way. 

Less than three weeks after this, he hastily had me meet his parents. This was completely unannounced to me until 24 hours before. It was a disaster trying to wait around for them while they kept changing all their plans. Instead of brunch like he promised the day before, he just dragged them to the coffee shop at our university in between of my afternoon classes and they all had to leave within 10 minutes. This was also after minimal contact between us and i was still in the throes of my heart being broken.

He's also tried texting me first more and planning more dates himself. It would have been sweet like 8 months ago when conversations like the one we had about reciprocation first started. I think he truly is doing his best.

But my heart has been sore. I've been so secretly angry at him that it's starting to affect how I see him when we're talking and seeing each other. I have to hold all my emotions and put them aside when we're together just so we can have a few good moments.

He's working so hard for us but i still feel so disappointed and angry at him.   
I seriously imagined a future with him. It took my heart actually breaking in front of him for him to start acting right. And my heart is still broken even after his best attempts. I consulted a friend and she was in a similar situation with a guy for years. She told me that if he can't see a future with me now, he never will. That seems to be the case. I just want someone who sees a future that he's excited about with me. but i also want to appreciate the work he's doing but it's so hard. ",2,1759691873.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

But he said, “Don’t disgust me, little sister.”

The rock-band frontman who owned every stage made sure I could hear him next door with someone else, and my tears had long run dry.

So I cut off the long hair he once adored, packed my bags, and slipped out of his world.

I thought he wouldn’t care.

Until much later, he spun out of control like a wild riff, retracing every step I had ever taken to find me.



……



Ten days.

That's how long it had been since I decided to stop loving Sebastian Hayes.

The scissors felt cold against my neck as I watched ten years of hair fall to the bathroom floor in dark waves. Each snip was deliberate, final—like severing the threads that had bound me to him for so long.

The same hair he'd once run his fingers through backstage at the Roundhouse, high on adrenaline after a show, telling me I looked like a Pre-Raphaelite painting. Before he remembered he was supposed to see me as just his little sister.

""Sophia?"" My father's voice drifted up the stairs, but I didn't answer.

I stared at my reflection, barely recognizing the girl looking back. Short hair framed my face in a way that made me look older, stronger. Like someone who could walk away from a boy who wrote songs about running from feelings he couldn't name.

My phone buzzed. A text from my mother, Catherine Morrison, whom I hadn't spoken to in three years.

""Mom,"" I said when she picked up on the first ring. ""I want to come to Vancouver. To study. To live with you.""

The silence stretched between London and Vancouver before she spoke. ""What happened, sweetheart?""

Everything. Nothing. The same story I'd been living for years—loving a boy who turned his pain into three-chord progressions and his fear into reverb-soaked vocals, but never into honesty about what I meant to him.

""I need to leave,"" I whispered, and somehow she understood.

""I'll arrange everything. Tomorrow.""

I hung up and sank onto my bed, memories flooding back like a broken dam. Seven years old, clutching Sebastian's hand as our parents announced their marriage. He'd been my anchor then, my protector, the older brother who made everything feel safe—even before he picked up his first guitar and learned to channel everything he felt into music instead of words.

Until I turned seventeen.

I could still feel the weight of that diary in my hands, pages filled with confessions I'd poured out in purple ink. The letter I'd written him, trembling as I placed it on his desk—right next to the battered Fender he treated better than he'd ever treated me. My heart had been so full that day, so ready to burst with all the love I'd kept hidden.

""What is this?"" His voice had been ice.

I'd watched him tear each page slowly, deliberately, those same hands that coaxed raw emotion from guitar strings now destroying my words. The sound of paper ripping was like bones breaking. My heart, scattered across his bedroom floor like confetti at a funeral—or like the guitar picks he left everywhere, careless reminders of the life he valued more than mine.

""You're my stepsister, Sophia. Don't ever forget that.""

Stepsister. The word had branded itself into my chest, burned deeper than any lyric he'd ever written.

Now, three years later, the brand was finally healing over.

""Sophia!"" The voice was different this time. Feminine, musical, sickeningly sweet. ""Come meet your future sister-in-law!""

Victoria Bennett stood in our living room like she owned it, her blonde hair catching the afternoon light streaming through the windows. She was everything I wasn't—tall where I was average, confident where I was invisible, chosen where I was forgotten. And she belonged to Sebastian's world in a way I never could—she managed his band, booked his shows, understood the chaos of late-night rehearsals and early-morning sound checks.

""Victoria, this is Sophia,"" Sebastian said, his arm wrapped around her waist like a claim. He was wearing his usual post-rehearsal look—black jeans, worn band t-shirt, fingers still marked with the indent of guitar strings. ""My stepsister.""

There it was again. Stepsister.

""Oh, you're the one living here!"" Victoria's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Sebastian's told me so much about you. I caught one of his shows at the Roundhouse last month—absolutely electric. You must be so proud of your brother.""

Brother. The word hit me like a physical blow, made worse by the memory of standing in that exact crowd, watching him pour his soul into lyrics I knew were about me, about us, about everything he refused to acknowledge in daylight.

""Congratulations,"" I managed, my voice steady even as my world tilted.

Sebastian was watching me with those dark eyes that had once been my salvation. Now they looked right through me, seeing nothing but the shadow of a girl he'd raised, a responsibility he'd outgrown—someone who didn't fit into the world of dive bars and late-night recording sessions he'd built to escape whatever he felt when he looked at me.

""We're getting married next month,"" Victoria continued, practically glowing. ""A winter wedding! And you'll be there, won't you? As family? Maybe Sebastian will even play something—he's been working on this beautiful acoustic piece.""

I wondered if it was the one I'd heard him playing at 3 AM last week, when he thought everyone was asleep. The melody had sounded like goodbye.

Family. As if I'd ever truly been that.

""Actually,"" I said, surprised by how calm I sounded, ""I'll be in Canada by then. UBC accepted my transfer.""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Sebastian's eyes snapped to mine, and for just a moment, I saw something flicker there—the same raw vulnerability I'd seen on stage when he sang, when he let the music speak truths his mouth refused to form. Surprise? Confusion? Fear?

But then Victoria squealed with delight. ""Oh, how exciting! A fresh start!""

Fresh start. Yes. Away from the sound of his guitar bleeding through the walls at night, away from lyrics that told me everything and nothing, away from a boy who could bare his soul to strangers in a crowd but not to the girl who'd loved him for ten years.

That's exactly what this was.

I excused myself and climbed the stairs to my room, each step lighter than the last. Tomorrow, I would pack my life into suitcases and leave this house where I'd learned that loving someone who turns their feelings into art instead of action is just another form of self-destruction.

But tonight, I had one last thing to do.

I pulled out my phone and scrolled to Sebastian's contact. My finger hovered over his name for a long moment before I pressed delete.

Then I sat down at my desk and began to write him one final letter—not of love this time, but of goodbye.

The pen felt heavy in my hand, but the words came easily now.

Thank you for teaching me how to leave.

Chapter 2

The Hayes family pearl necklace felt cold against my palm.

I stared at the lustrous white pearls, remembering the Christmas morning when Sebastian had clasped it around my neck. ""So you'll always belong somewhere,"" he'd said, his fingers gentle at my nape—the same fingers that had just finished a three-hour recording session, still bearing the red marks of steel strings.

He'd bought it with money from his first paying gig. I'd overheard him telling his bandmate that, pride in his voice. At the time, I'd thought it meant something.

Belong. What a cruel joke.

My hands trembled as I placed it in the cardboard box with the other relics of my foolishness. The cashmere scarf he'd chosen for my eighteenth birthday, soft as a whisper and the color of winter sky. The leather-bound copy of Jane Eyre with his careful annotations in the margins—notes he'd written during tour bus rides, each one a breadcrumb I'd followed deeper into my delusion. The collection of guitar picks he'd given me over the years, each one from a significant show, as if sharing his music with me was the same as sharing his heart.

""What are you doing?""

I didn't look up as Sebastian filled the doorway. He was still in his stage clothes—black skinny jeans ripped at the knees, a Ramones t-shirt that had seen better days, his dark hair messy in that deliberately careless way that made fans scream. He smelled like cigarette smoke and the particular musk of small venues, mixed with his usual sandalwood cologne.

""Packing.""

""Sophia—""

""Don't."" The word came out sharper than I intended. ""Just... don't.""

He stepped into my room anyway, and I caught the full force of that backstage scent—sweat and adrenaline and the ghost of whatever he'd been drinking. ""You don't have to throw everything away,"" he said quietly.

""Yes, I do.""

Every gift, every memory, every stupid memento of a love that was never returned. Into the box they went, one by one, like I was burying the dead. Even the bootleg recording of his first real show, the one he'd given me with ""For Sophia—my first real fan"" scrawled on the CD in Sharpie.

""Sophia, we need to talk—""

""Sebastian!"" Victoria's voice cut through whatever he'd been about to say. She appeared beside him, all golden hair and perfectly applied lipstick, extending a small velvet box toward me. She was dressed for industry—sharp blazer, designer heels, the look of someone who spent her days negotiating with venue managers and record label executives. ""I have a little welcome gift for my new sister!""

Sister. There was that word again, twisted into something that sounded like ownership.

""You didn't have to—"" I started.

""Nonsense! Open it!""

Inside was a delicate gold bracelet, the kind that cost more than most people's rent. Beautiful, expensive, and completely wrong for me.

""Let me put it on you!"" Victoria chirped, reaching for my wrist before I could protest.

The metal clasp closed around my skin like a shackle.

The reaction was immediate—a burning sensation that spread up my arm like wildfire. I gasped, trying to unclasp the bracelet, but Victoria held my wrist tight.

""What's wrong?"" she asked, but her eyes were dancing with something that looked suspiciously like satisfaction.

""Metal allergy,"" I managed, finally getting the clasp open. Angry red welts were already forming where the bracelet had touched my skin.

Sebastian's face went white. ""Christ, Sophia, are you—"" His hand reached out instinctively, the callused fingertips from years of playing rough against my inflamed skin.

""I'm fine."" I wasn't. My wrist felt like it was on fire.

""Oh no!"" Victoria gasped, but she was looking at Sebastian, not at me. ""I'm so sorry, darling! I had no idea!""

Darling. She was calling him darling while I stood there with chemical burns on my arm.

""It's fine,"" I said again, even as my skin continued to burn. ""Really.""

Sebastian reached for my wrist, his fingers cool against the inflamed skin. For just a moment, I let myself remember when his touch meant comfort, protection, love. When those hands created beauty on guitar strings and gentleness with me.

Then Victoria made a small, wounded sound, and his attention snapped back to her like she was magnetic north.

""Baby, don't cry,"" he murmured, pulling her into his arms. ""It was an accident.""

Baby. When had he started calling her that?

I turned back to my packing, adding the bracelet to the box with everything else. My wrist throbbed, but it was nothing compared to the ache in my chest.

""I'll be staying here for the next few days,"" Victoria announced, her voice bright and cheerful again. ""Wedding planning, you know! There's so much to do! Plus Sebastian has that showcase at the Lexington on Thursday—I need to be here to coordinate with the promoter.""

""Here?"" I looked up despite myself.

""Well, yes. I mean, this will be my home soon enough."" She laughed that musical laugh that made my teeth ache. ""You'll have to get used to calling me sister, Sophia. Maybe you can even come to the showcase! Sebastian's debuting that new song—the acoustic one. It's absolutely heartbreaking.""

I wondered if it was the one that had kept me awake for weeks, bleeding through the walls at 3 AM. The one that sounded like regret set to melody.

The way she said my name made it sound like something dirty.

""I'm just cleaning out some old things,"" I said, taping up the box with more force than necessary.

""Spring cleaning in winter?"" Victoria laughed. ""How... thorough of you. Though I suppose it's good to make space for new memories, don't you think? Family memories.""

Family. She kept using that word like a weapon.

Sebastian was watching me with a frown, his dark eyes searching my face like he was trying to solve a puzzle. Those same eyes that could hold a crowd of hundreds, that closed when he sang like he was in pain. ""Sophia, are you sure you're alright?""

""Perfect,"" I lied smoothly. ""Never better.""

That evening, I sat on my bedroom floor surrounded by ten years of memories. Diary after diary, filled with Sebastian's name in looping script. Letters I'd written but never sent, pouring out feelings I'd been too afraid to voice. Photos from family vacations where I'd stood just close enough to him to feel his warmth but never close enough to matter. Concert tickets from every show I'd attended, each one a small piece of my heart I'd offered to someone who only ever saw me as audience.

I tore each page methodically, the sound of ripping paper a symphony of liberation. Even the setlist he'd once given me, with ""Sophia's Song"" written at the bottom—a track that never made it onto any album, that I'd never heard him play.

No tears. I'd cried enough over Sebastian Hayes to fill an ocean. Tonight, I felt nothing but a strange, cold clarity.

The girl who had loved him was dying, page by page.

And I was finally ready to let her go.

I stuffed the shredded remains into a garbage bag, twisted it shut, and set it by the door. Tomorrow, even the pieces would be gone.

From down the hall came the sound of Victoria's laughter, bright and victorious, followed by Sebastian's deeper chuckle. Then, faintly, the sound of acoustic guitar—he was playing for her. Something soft, intimate, nothing like the raw energy of his stage performances.

They sounded happy.

Good for them.

I turned off my light and lay in the darkness, my burned wrist still throbbing against the cool sheets.

In twenty-four hours, I would be on a plane to Vancouver, and they would wake up to find me gone.

The thought of their shock, their confusion, filled me with a dark satisfaction.

But first, I had to survive two more nights of pretending everything was normal.

Two more nights of hearing him make music for someone else.

Chapter 3

The walls in this house were too thin.

I lay in my bed, staring at the ceiling as soft laughter drifted through the wall separating my room from Sebastian's. Victoria's voice, breathy and intimate, followed by his deeper murmur of response.

Then, the sound I'd been dreading—the gentle strumming of an acoustic guitar. Not the aggressive, distorted riffs he played on stage, but something tender. Vulnerable. The kind of music he only made in private, the kind I used to think was reserved for moments that mattered.

He was playing for her. Playing that song—the one I'd heard him working on for weeks, the melody that had haunted my sleepless nights.

The bedframe creaked in rhythm with the soft chord progression.

I pressed my pillow over my ears, but it didn't help. Nothing could block out the sounds of him loving someone else in the room where I'd once brought him soup when he was sick, where we'd argued about homework, where he'd first taught me three chords on his beaten-up starter guitar, his hands guiding mine on the fretboard.

Where I'd first realized I loved him—watching him lose himself in music, his eyes closed, his whole body swaying like the notes were pulling him somewhere I could never follow.

The guitar stopped. The creaking intensified.

I got up and walked to my window, pushing it open to let the cold London night air shock my system back to numbness. The garden below was silver with frost, beautiful and dead.

Like me.

Morning came eventually, as it always did.

I found them in the kitchen, Victoria perched on the counter in one of Sebastian's band t-shirts—the rare Nirvana bootleg he'd bought at Camden Market, the one he never let anyone touch. Her legs swung as she fed him pieces of strawberry, and I noticed the guitar pick necklace around her neck. One of his signature picks, the ones he used on stage.

The domestic scene was so perfectly orchestrated it looked like a magazine spread. Indie rocker and his muse.

""Sophia!"" Victoria's face lit up with false warmth. ""Perfect timing! We were just discussing Sebastian's birthday party next week.""

Birthday. Right. November fifteenth. I'd been planning his birthday celebrations since I was twelve years old. Last year, I'd gotten us tickets to see his favorite band at Brixton Academy. He'd hugged me so tight I could feel his heartbeat, whispered ""you get me"" against my hair. Then he'd invited Victoria along and I'd spent the night watching them from the crowd while my gift turned into their date.

""What do you think?"" Victoria continued, sliding off the counter to loop her arms around his waist. ""I was thinking of booking that new rooftop restaurant in Canary Wharf. Very exclusive, very romantic. Then maybe that underground club in Shoreditch—Sebastian's band is playing a secret show there that night.""

""Sounds perfect,"" I said, pouring coffee with steady hands.

Sebastian was watching me over Victoria's head, his expression unreadable. His hair was still messy from sleep, and there were fresh scratches on his neck that made my stomach turn. ""What would you like to do for my birthday, Sophia?""

The question hung in the air like a trap.

I almost laughed. What did I want to do? I wanted to take him to Brighton Beach, like he'd promised when I was sixteen. I wanted to watch the sunrise over the water while he told me stories about the places he'd travel on tour someday, the stages he'd conquer. I wanted to give him the vintage Gibson I'd been saving up to buy for three years—the one I'd seen him stare at in the shop window on Denmark Street, the one he'd called his ""dream guitar.""

I wanted a lot of things that would never happen.

""Whatever makes you happy,"" I said instead.

Something flickered across his face. Disappointment? Relief? I couldn't tell anymore.

""Actually,"" I continued, setting down my coffee cup, ""I might not be around for your birthday. I have some... appointments to attend to.""

""Appointments?"" Victoria's eyebrows rose. ""What kind of appointments?""

""Visa stuff,"" I said vaguely. ""For my student exchange program.""

It wasn't entirely a lie. I did have a visa—for permanent residency in Canada.

""Student exchange?"" Sebastian's voice sharpened, and he straightened up, dislodging Victoria's arms. ""Since when?""

""Since I applied six months ago."" Another lie, smooth as silk. ""I thought I mentioned it.""

""You didn't.""

""Oh."" I shrugged. ""Well, you've been busy.""

Busy with her. Busy with the band. Busy playing shows and writing songs and building a life where I was nothing but background noise. Busy planning a wedding. Busy forgetting I existed.

""Where are you going?"" Victoria asked, but her tone suggested she didn't really care. She was already scrolling through her phone—probably checking tour dates or venue bookings.

""Canada. Maybe Toronto. I haven't decided yet.""

""How long?"" Sebastian's jaw was tight, and I noticed his hand had curled into a fist, the same way it did before he went on stage. Nervous energy with nowhere to go.

""A semester. Maybe longer if I like it.""

""Sophia,"" he started, and there was something in his voice I couldn't quite place—the same raw quality that crept into his vocals when he sang certain lyrics. ""Don't you think you're being a bit... impulsive?""

Impulsive. After ten years of loving him, three years of waiting, ten days of planning my escape—he thought I was being impulsive.

""Maybe,"" I said. ""But sometimes impulsive is exactly what you need.""

Like when he'd decided to drop out of university to pursue music full-time. Like when he'd gotten that tattoo on his ribs—the one I'd accidentally seen once, lyrics in his own handwriting that he'd never explained. Like every spontaneous decision that had shaped his life while I stood on the sidelines, watching.

That afternoon, Vancouver was drowning in rain.

I sat in a coffee shop near the visa office, scrolling through social media while trying to ignore the weather that seemed determined to match my mood. The cafe was warm and crowded, full of people living their ordinary, uncomplicated lives.

My phone buzzed. A notification from Instagram.

Sebastian had posted a photo.

Against my better judgment, I clicked on it.

The image filled my screen—him and Victoria in what looked like a recording studio, her in a white bathrobe, him shirtless with his guitar across his lap, both of them laughing at something off-camera. The caption read: ""Late night sessions with my perfect woman. New music coming soon. #blessed #love #forever""

The comments were already pouring in. Heart emojis and congratulations and fans gushing about what a beautiful couple they made, begging for details about the new music.

I scrolled down and found myself typing before I could stop myself: ""Wishing you both all the happiness in the world.""

I hit send and immediately regretted it.

Within seconds, hearts started appearing on my comment. Victoria had liked it. Some of Sebastian's bandmates had liked it. Even my father had liked it.

My phone buzzed with a direct message from Victoria: ""Aww, thanks babe! You're the sweetest sister-in-law ever! 💕 You should hear the song Sebastian wrote—it's absolutely beautiful. So emotional.""

Sister-in-law. Not even sister anymore—sister-in-law. Like I was already being moved to the periphery of their story.

And that song. I wondered if it was the one that had bled through the walls last night. The one he'd played while making love to her. The one that should have been mine.

I deleted Instagram from my phone.

Then I deleted Facebook.

Then Twitter.

One by one, I removed every app that connected me to them, to their happiness, to the life they were building without me. To the growing fanbase that watched Sebastian pour his heart out on stage, never knowing that the girl who'd been his first audience, his first believer, was being erased from his story.

By the time I walked back into the house that evening, I felt lighter somehow. Disconnected. Free.

""How did your appointment go?"" Sebastian asked when I found him in the study, working on something on his laptop—probably editing a demo or responding to booking inquiries.

""Fine,"" I said. ""Everything's moving along nicely.""

He nodded absently, already turning back to his screen. The instrumental track playing softly from his speakers sounded unfinished, searching. ""Good. That's... good.""

I stood in the doorway for a moment, memorizing the sight of him. The way his dark hair fell across his forehead when he concentrated. The slight furrow between his brows. The strong line of his shoulders. The tattoo on his inner wrist—a simple treble clef that he claimed meant nothing but I knew marked the day he'd decided music was everything.

This was how I wanted to remember him. Not as the man who'd torn up my love letters or chosen someone else. Just as Sebastian, beautiful and distant and completely absorbed in his own world. The world he'd built in sound and fury, where emotions were only safe when translated into chord progressions and metaphors.

""Goodnight,"" I said softly.

""Night, Sophia.""

He didn't look up.

Upstairs, Victoria was singing in the shower, her voice echoing off the bathroom tiles. Something about being happy, being free, being in love. It sounded like a song from the radio, generic and forgettable.

Nothing like the raw, honest music Sebastian created. But maybe that's what he wanted now—something easy, uncomplicated. Something that didn't require him to feel too deeply.

I closed my bedroom door and turned the lock.

Sixteen hours.

In sixteen hours, I would be gone, and they would have their perfect life without the ghost of an unwanted stepsister haunting the edges of their happiness.

I sat at my desk and pulled out a single sheet of paper, my mother's Vancouver address already written at the top.

It was time to write my final goodbye.

But first, I pulled out my phone one last time and searched for Sebastian's band name. Their latest single came up—the one he'd released last month, the one that had started getting real attention from indie music blogs and playlist curators.

I hit play and let the opening chords wash over me. His voice, raw and aching, filled my room:

""I keep running from the truth in your eyes / Building walls from guitar strings and lies / You're the ghost in every song I write / The reason I only sing at night...""

I listened to the whole song, every word a confession he'd never say to my face. Every melody a goodbye he didn't have the courage to speak out loud.

Then I deleted the app and turned off my phone.

Tomorrow, even his music couldn't reach me anymore.

Chapter 4

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number.

""Check Sebastian's story. You'll want to see this. - Anonymous""

I stared at the message for a long moment before deleting it. Whatever it was, I didn't want to know. That part of my life was over.

Downstairs, I could hear them moving around, their voices a low murmur punctuated by occasional laughter. They were going out—dinner reservations at some expensive place in Mayfair, another public declaration of their love.

Perfect. It would give me time to pack without questions.

I waited until I heard the front door close and Sebastian's car pull out of the driveway before I moved. Three suitcases, carefully chosen to hold only the essentials. Clothes, books, the few pieces of jewelry that weren't from him. My passport, my acceptance letter to UBC, my mother's phone number written on a slip of paper in case my phone died.

The house felt different with them gone. Smaller somehow, like it was already preparing to forget me.

I was folding my last sweater when I heard voices outside. Not their voices—different ones, familiar in a way that made my stomach clench.

University friends. Of course. They always gathered here before nights out, drawn by Sebastian's easy charm and the well-stocked bar.

""Sophia!"" Marcus called out as they trooped through the front door. ""Come have a drink with us!""

I descended the stairs slowly, pasting on the smile I'd perfected over years of being the little sister, the tag-along, the afterthought.

""Look who's all grown up,"" Rebecca laughed, pulling me into a hug that smelled like expensive perfume and wine. ""God, you look different. Did you cut your hair?""

""A little,"" I said.

""It looks amazing! Very... liberated.""

If only she knew.

They settled into the living room like they owned it, drinks appearing in hands with the magic of long practice. I sat on the edge of the group, nursing a glass of water and listening to the familiar rhythm of their conversations.

""Remember when Sebastian jumped into the Thames to save you?"" Jessica was saying, her words slightly slurred. ""You were what, fifteen? And you couldn't swim?""

Sixteen. I was sixteen, and the water had been so cold it had stolen my breath. Sebastian had dove in fully clothed, his expensive watch forgotten as he pulled me to shore. He'd wrapped me in his jacket and carried me to the car, whispering reassurances the whole way home.

""You were so lucky to have him looking out for you,"" Rebecca added. ""Like having a superhero for a big brother.""

Brother. Always brother.

""He was different then,"" I said quietly.

""Different how?"" Marcus leaned forward, interested.

I thought about it for a moment—how to explain the way Sebastian used to look at me, really look at me, like I mattered. How he'd remember my favorite books and bring me soup when I was sick and drive me to school when it rained because he knew I hated getting wet.

1nyx9au,https://i.redd.it/d43b3t0c7ctf1.jpeg,Fall Lineup (so far),"Hey, y'all. Long time lurker/commenter, first time poster. I thought I'd share the candles I've been collecting into the cooler months. I've been inspired by this sub since June and I just put away most of my summer candles. I haven't taken the plunge on anything crazy yet (Trudon/Diptyque) and have mostly been shopping sales when I see them. Bear with me here as I've never written candle reviews! All of the candles are burned on the kitchen counter in the picture and I judge the throws based on how they fill the room behind it.

**Boy Smells**

I know that BS can be polarizing here but I've really loved what I have picked up from their rebranded line. I didn't ever really have any of the OG ones until I started seeing them at HomeGoods so I don't have a ton of history here. All of them burn super clean, don't tunnel, and have amazing throws. Their scents all feel very original to me.

*HardWood*

This is very woody with a nice hint of leather. It definitely leans more masculine but it's a nice, clean wood scent. The throw is on the higher side of moderate.

*Vanilla Era*

This is an elite candle for me. It has a sharpness to it that tickles your nose right up front. It doesn't smell overtly like vanilla but more of a sophisticated suede with a hint of sweetness. It is a beast when it comes to throw. It fills most of the front of my entire house and it's only an 8.5 ounce candle! Throw is an 10/10 and I can't imagine what the 3-wick version would do.

*Red Hot*

I feel like their website describes it well- incense, raspberries, and roses. While neither of those notes particularly stand out, they blend together to create a warm and rich scent profile. The throw is on the higher side of moderate.

*De Nimes*

A Marshalls find (thanks to this sub!). This is a strange candle. It's described as having notes of almond, rhubarb, blueberry, and juniper, but it kind of has none of those scents at all? It almost smells like a cologne. It's not bad but it's my least favorite BS candle so far. Throw is on the lower side of moderate.

*Woodphoria*

Another Marshalls pickup. Smells as advertised. Notes of fig and jasmine are prominent with the sandalwood and cedar really grounding the whole thing. It's a cozy scent that will be nice when the weather starts to cool off. The throw is moderate.

*Cedar Stack*

Marshalls grab! I haven't burned this one yet so I can't speak to it's performance but the cold throw smells great. I get a lot of woody notes with a touch of juniper. Which makes me think this is going to be great closer to Christmas Time.

  
**Linnea** 

*Harvest Pumpkin*

Another one that I haven't burned yet because I need the weather in Houston to cool off more. It smells amazing in the box. Like a pumpkin pie that's not too sweet that's layered with cozy kitchen spices. I suspect this will burn great with the double-wick that it's rocking. \*Wife favorite 

  
**Apotheke**

*Charcoal*

I scooped this on sales at The Container Store a while back (thanks to this sub!). It's very smoky without feeling like you are sniffing charred wood. It's balanced nicely by subtle notes of fruitiness and a very light maple note. My wife despises this candle and says it smells like BBQ. I think it will be a vibe when it's cold as hell outside. Throw is on the lighter side of strong.

  
**FVITH**

*October*

I sat on this one for a while waiting until October to light it. The cold throw smelled like a strong and heavy cologne or even body-spray. It really opens up when it's lit, however. I get notes of sweet berries, rum, and oud. I really enjoyed this one and it performed really well. Great for cooler months for sure. The throw is strong. 

  
**LAFCO**

*Pumpkin Seed & Sandalwood*

We had tried the smaller LAFCO candles in our living room with no luck. I think they are just too small for our space because they smelled amazing when we moved them to a bathroom. So I scooped one of the larger single wicks to try out and that solved the problem. This is an awesome fall scent that does not smell gourmand or like a pumpkin coffee. The fennel note is prominent which makes it feel seasonal but sophisticated. The larger single-wick size easily filled our space and I'm excited to reuse that vessel. Throw is strong. \*Wife favorite 

  
**Archipelago** 

*Stonehenge* 

This one is clean and cozy as hell. Big bergamot and amber notes dominate with a touch of woodiness in the background. We've had this candle for a while but I figured it'd be good to burn during the cooler months. The performance is amazing on this one thanks to the double-wick action. It is a bit sooty, however. Throw is strong. \*Wife favorite 

  
Woof! Hopefully the formatting is okay, as I don't post on Reddit very often. We're making another pilgrimage to a locally owned department store tomorrow morning so we'll be bringing home some more candles no doubt. I can update this post with our new selections. Also, I burn all of my candles under the Williams Sonoma Cloche and that has solved all of my tunneling problems with brands like Apotheke. Highly recommend. Thanks for reading!

1nyx8w8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nyx8w8/when_the_helpers_need_help/,When the helpers need help,"HI (63M) - lurker but decided to post today - I have been dealing with Bipolar depression most of my life and lately it has been bad. Last weekend I bought some rope and aimlessly wandered around my house and garage looking for a place that would work (the rope sits on the couch next to me just waiting). Didn't find a place, and not sure what I would have done if I did, but I NEEDED to know I had a way out. I just hurt inside. My life is crap. Kids and brothers are out of my life and the small group of friends I have don't seem to know what to do with me and, I feel, are sick of me and my depression and physical issues. 



Here's the kicker. I work in mental health care as a Peer. At work I put on the mask and try to help while at the same time realizing I am doing worse that many of our clients. I don't think I would take my own life, but maybe?, on the other hand I don't want to keep trying and going nowhere. It is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Just going through the motions and wishing the dam ship would sink already and I could find some peace.



I just keep on waking up, drinking my coffee and wait for ????? I just don't want to fight anymore. I can't remember the last time I was happy or in any content. It just hurts. I know I am cry-babying and I am sorry, I just needed to type this out. Thanks for listening.   ",4,1759691780.0,depression,1,1.0,False

We’re currently doing over 60 hours a week, nonstop for the next 18 months. We get no time off for sick days, the SEE, or NCE. I live away from all of my family and friends. I went to school at the first place that would accept me and truthfully I live somewhere kind of awful, where I don’t align myself morally, socially, and most definitely not politically. We’re about to be in -30 degree weather. There isn’t shit to do here. I’m going to a rural site for all of the dead of winter. I know this will end at some point but I can’t even enjoy my weekends. I literally just feel heavy and like I want to cry, wondering if I made a mistake. I didn’t realize how much of a sacrifice this really is. My mental health has never been worse in my entire life and of course, CRNA school just doesn’t care. I’m finding it so hard to feel festive and joyful for the holidays coming up, mind you I have to spend them at the hospital, and all I can think about is how much this sucks. I can’t shake this headspace. I keep trying to get outside and maybe do things on the weekends, but I’m doing this alone off student loans and will graduate with like $250k at current federal interest rates. I cant even buy myself a coffee without feeling financial anxiety. I tried to get back on an anti-depressant that I used to use successfully and got horrible migraines from it so I had to stop, and I don’t have time to risk getting that again because we have no sick days. I just can’t fathom the next 18 months of my life being like this. I sound super negative but I’m trying so. Hard. I’ve tried to get outside and spend time with classmates, go to events in town, etc. but every time I have a slow moment of peace on the weekends I want to break down.

1nyx6t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1nyx6t5/how_to_beat_creative_fatigue_before_it_happens/,How To Beat Creative Fatigue Before It Happens,"I’ve seen the same pattern across every Facebook ad account I’ve ever touched. Ads don’t die because they’re tired,  they die because they stop getting shown to the right people.

Facebook builds your audience model off your copy, your CAPI events, and the words on your static images. When any of that data sends the wrong signal, your ads start hitting the wrong pockets of the platform. That’s when CAC climbs and engagement turns into complaint threads.

**Here’s how to fix it fast:**

# Re-categorize your copy

Strip out buzzwords that could confuse the algorithm. Every word on your image, headline, and primary copy should point to one clear niche, archetypical story and problem/solution. Direct response, at its core, it’s about One Thing/One Thing. One problem, one solution with a storied mechanism that brings positioning instantly to life, “I wasn’t low in energy or stricken with brain fog, I had no dopamine! That’s why coffee and energy drinks never worked for me.” 

Now say that in 20 different ways to flesh out that positioning point, so the algo can learn and grow your TAM.

# Always Run Engagement Ads

Launch engagement or video-view ads using your best positioning angle. But you aren’t giving advice, like me here. You’re straight up sharing to trigger empathy and community in your comments. *“I’ve been trying to wean from SRRIs, but my doctor never told me about dopamine blunting and HOW to wean, without losing my mind. If you’re a long time SSRI user, what’s been your weaning experience? Or why have you chosen to stay on them, even when you know your whole personality is different?”* 

Positive comments and longer watch times retrain the algo toward belief-aligned users who grow your TAM and conversions.

Engagement ads reach out to 2-3 more people than conversion ads.

Hard not to see why that’s important.

# Feed Fresh Relevance

When your ads start getting shown to the same small circle over and over, that isn’t “frequency,” it’s audience stagnation. It happens when the algorithm runs out of new, relevant users because your data signals stopped expanding how the algo serves your ads. 

Facebook’s learning model loops inside that limited TAM, assuming those same users are your best bet, even if they’re not converting. Your job is to feed the system new, high-quality relevance so it can escape that loop.

**Here’s how (with 3 sub-tips:)**

# Change The Emotional Angle, Not The Core Message

If your positioning is “my brain forgot how to make dopamine,” keep that truth intact. Reframe it through frustration, relief, curiosity, or authority. The underlying mechanism stays the same, but the emotional resonance changes, giving the algorithm new clusters to test.

# Swap Symbols, Keep The Story

Your symbols are an “advertising element” meant to trigger data signals. Read those signals. If one symbol is triggering enough association, find the symbol that does. A photo of a coffee cup, a slumped-over desk, or a glowing focus face all point to the same mechanism, but hit different awareness points. 

Each new symbol reintroduces your message to new users - helping expand TAM.

# Refresh The Post ID

Reupload top performers with new IDs every few weeks. Facebook treats them as fresh data, retriggers organic engagement, and gives the algo another chance to rebuild your TAM with updated context.

Drop some of your own “fake creative fatigue” systems you put in place to scale faster and more reliably on META.",1,1759691651.0,FacebookAds,0,1.0,False

1nyx6k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Beautiful-Warning719/comments/1nyx6k1/chapter_15_the_seed_of_doubt/,CHAPTER 15: The Seed of Doubt,"***POV: Aiden***

The email arrived at 3:17 a.m., a time reserved for insomnia and bad decisions. The sender was an encrypted, untraceable address. The subject line was a single, gut-punching word: ***Compromise***.

Every instinct screamed to delete it, to ignore this latest poison. But the part of me that was still a CEO, the part trained to assess every threat, clicked it open.

There were no words. Just three attachments.

*The first was a financial record.* A wire transfer, dated two weeks *before* our anniversary, from a corporate entity I didn't recognize to an offshore account. The beneficiary was listed as *S. Rhodes Consulting LLC.*

My blood ran cold. Sophie's maiden name. A company I never knew existed.

*The second was a series of grainy, long-lens photographs*. Sophie, entering a sleek downtown high-rise that housed one of my most aggressive corporate rivals, ***Sterling Dynamics***. In another, she was sitting in a café across from David Sterling himself, the billionaire shark who had been trying to gut my company for years. She wasn't smiling, but she was leaning forward, intense. Engaged.

*The third attachment was a screenshot of a text message chain, from a number listed as* ***S.***

***Unknown:*** *The information needs to be more substantive. He's insulated on the new merger.*

***S:*** *I'll get it. The anniversary is the deadline. He'll be distracted.*

***Unknown:*** *Ensure you do. The final payment is contingent.*

The date on the final text was the morning of our anniversary. The morning I had walked back into her life with Alessia.

The room tilted. The careful peace of the coffee, the quiet pride in her eyes, the entire fragile foundation of the last few weeks—it all crumbled into dust.

It was a masterpiece of deception. It explained everything. Her two years of silence—not patience, but planning. Her sudden push for the divorce—not liberation, but the culmination of a contract. Her ""Unvarnished Truth"" exhibition—a brilliant piece of misdirection, painting herself as the victim while she systematically sold me out.

The grief was so violent it felt like physical sickness. I staggered to the bathroom, bracing myself against the sink, my knuckles white. I had stood in that gallery and defended her. I had gone to war with my own mother for her. I had believed, with a desperate, pathetic hope, that I was finally earning a sliver of redemption.

And the entire time, she was playing me.

***POV: Sophie***

The pounding on my door was frantic, loud enough to jolt me from a deep sleep. I fumbled for my robe, heart hammering. *""Lucas?""* I called out, my voice thick with sleep.

The door flew open before I reached it.

Aiden stood there, silhouetted in the hallway light. He wasn't the calm man from the coffee shop. This was the ghost from our worst fights, his face a mask of ravaged fury and pain. He held his phone out like a weapon.

*""What is this, Sophie?""* His voice was a low, dangerous tremor.

I took a step back, my mind scrambling. *""Aiden? What are you—""*

*""Two weeks before our anniversary,""* he cut in, advancing into my apartment. *""You incorporated a consulting firm. Why?""*

The question was so bizarre, so out of context, that I could only stare. *""A what? I didn't—""*

*""Don't!""* he roared, the sound echoing in the small space. He shoved the phone in my face. The screen showed a document with my name. *""And this? A meeting with* ***David Sterling?*** *Care to explain what you and my biggest rival had to discuss so intently?""*

***David Sterling?*** The name meant nothing to me. I looked at the grainy photo. It was me, but the location... it was a generic coffee shop near the gallery district. The man... I vaguely remembered him. He'd approached me months ago, a potential client interested in corporate art acquisitions. The meeting had gone nowhere. *""That was a client,""* I said, my own anger beginning to rise. *""Months ago. He wanted to buy art for his offices. It fell through. How dare you come here and—""*

*""And the texts, Sophie?""* he snarled, his eyes wild with betrayal. *""The texts about the anniversary being a* ***'deadline'?*** *Were you so eager to be rid of me that you sold our company's secrets to pay for your freedom?""*

The accusations were so ludicrous, so perfectly aimed at my deepest character, that for a moment, I was speechless. He truly believed this. He looked at me and saw a traitor.

All the progress, the fragile understanding, the shared legal battle—it evaporated. We were back in the mud, and he was throwing the filth himself.

I drew myself up to my full height, the cold, familiar armor snapping back into place. *""Get out.""*

His jaw tightened. *""Not until you admit it.""*

*""Get out of my home,""* I repeated, my voice glacial. *""And don't you ever come back.""*

For a long moment, he just stared at me, his chest heaving, the evidence he considered irrefutable glowing in his hand. I saw the exact moment the doubt flickered in his eyes, a tiny crack in his certainty. But the poison was too fresh, too potent.

He turned and left, slamming the door so hard the frame shook.

I stood there, alone in the sudden silence, the phantom scent of his cologne and his accusations hanging in the air. The seed had been planted. And I knew, with a sickening certainty, exactly whose hand had sown it.

***POV: Alessia***

I watched the live feed from the hidden camera I'd planted in Sophie's hallway. The audio was crystal clear. His rage. Her denials. The slam of the door.

***Perfect.\~\~\~***

I took a slow sip of champagne. The beauty of the lie was its foundation in a sliver of truth. She *had* met with David Sterling. She *did* have a dormant LLC from a failed freelance project years ago. All it took was a few forged documents and a manipulated text log to weave a tapestry of betrayal he was primed to believe.

**He would never trust her again. The reconciliation was dead.**

Now, isolated and feeling like a fool, he would be vulnerable. Angry. And ripe for the final move.

I picked up my phone and typed a message to a new number.

***Alessia:*** *He's alone now. And he's furious. It's your turn. Be the friend he needs. And make sure he knows who his real enemy is.*

The game was entering its final, most satisfying phase.

\*\*TO BE CONTINUED...\*\*

1nyx642,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1nyx642/trip_report_capri_5_nights/,Trip report: Capri 5 nights,"We spent 14 nights in Italy- 5 nights in Capri, 5 nights in Florence, 2 nights in Venice, 2 nights in Rome. This trip report is just for Capri, may or may not do the other cities because there are plenty of posts on them. Capri was my favorite of all.

Pros: absolutely gorgeous and chill. The cliff and ocean views from many restaurants and walkways are breathtaking and magical. It was wonderful to be able to soak in the beauty of the architecture and general beauty of the island as we strolled around. 5 nights was the perfect amount of time to see everything we wanted while also being able to truly relax and enjoy the sun, ocean, and food. Food was very good and I am now obsessed with ravioli caprese and lemon pasta. 

Cons: the port and Capri town get maddeningly busy late morning to early evening so it’s best to spend the afternoon away from those spots. Everything is also more expensive than other cities. The roads are narrow, winding, and steep so taking the bus and taxi was terrifying at times because they drive really fast. In my opinion 1 day is not enough to truly appreciate Capri because of how busy it gets and the weather might not cooperate. We were rained out the day we planned on doing the blue grotto and the chairlift for mont solaro. If you are planning on a day trip I implore you to instead spend a few nights there. 

Food/restaurants: Da Paolino for lemon pasta, seafood risotto, and lemon grove ambiance. Ristorante Il Geranio Capri for ravioli caprese, wine, and good ocean views from the cliffside. Restaurant bagni tiberio- food wasn’t the best (veal cutlet was good) but the view and walk to get there are gorgeous. Capri rooftop had really good eggplant polpette, wine, and cliff side ocean views. Ristorante Da Ciro had the best gnocchi, stuffed zucchini flowers, and ocean views. Pulalli had a great view overlooking the square and everything we got was great.  Buonocore had the best gelato out of every gelato place we went during our entire trip, beating every place in Florence, Rome, and Venice. The freshly made and warm waffle cones hit it out of the park. 

Other things to do/see: do a small group tour of the island. Our boat tour around the island was perfect with only 10 people. We got to swim for a good amount of time and they gave us snacks, wine, and homemade limoncello. Spend a few hours relaxing at a cafe drinking wine and coffee in the main piazza in Capri town. Walk all over Capri town, there are so many beautiful neighborhoods and walkways. Via Krupp was fun and the walk to the Gardens of Augustus was beautiful. Walk around Anacapri, it has its own charm separate from Capri town and good food. Spend the late morning/afternoon at a beach club. We reserved 2 chairs at bagni internazionale ahead of time and loved our day there. 

Getting there: We flew into Rome as I had bought round trip plane tickets many months before finalizing our plans. After landing we went straight onto the Leonardo express to Roma Termini then took the Italo train to Naples. From the Naples train station we took a taxi to Port Beverello and from there we took the NLG ferry to Capri port. The trains were easy to navigate, though of course you need to be aware of strikes. On our leg going from Florence to Venice, there was something else going on and the station was packed like sardines! So prepare yourself for crowds.",8,1759691607.0,ItalyTravel,3,1.0,False

Obviously work isnt the right place plus somehow everyone i know is married.  Coffee shop rarely have girls in it and when they do it is a couple. Bars isnt the vibe as drunk women arent fun at all. And then the gym is not a place to hit on women especially since I am not a regular.

Overall, I dont really see a woman that makes me take double look. I know that feeling before as I felt that in college with a few girls.

I thought I was going crazy until I went to other big cities and saw the women there. My hormones kicked it very quickly lol. But where I am at, I dont get that feel at all.

What would you guys do?

For whatever insane reason, I felt like he was drawn to me from the first moment we met. Since then, he has always made an effort to talk to me, initiate texts and even suggests 1-on-1 time, such as going for coffee. Isn't he just being friendly? Yeah, it's plausible - I've never really experienced a heterosexual male friendship before, so I don't know what that dynamic is like. But it's the way his eyes light up when he sees me, the way he beelines towards me in a room full of people, the subtle physical touches, the way we connect over similar past traumas. I don't see him treat anyone else this way. He made me feel like love might actually be possible. It feels like a fever dream. 

There's just one (major) problem... I find out he has a long term girlfriend. I know in any other sub I will get called an AH left, right and centre for entertaining this. But as a FAW who has never felt this special or seen before, it's hard to let go of a scenario that seems so perfect, even though I clearly know it's wrong. The connection we have just feels so genuine. IF things were to advance, I obviously wouldn't follow through.

I just bought one. Mine does. I did follow the manual's instructions to wash it out a few times, and boil a few rounds of water, before actually using it to do pours. It is still early days, it hasn't been used much. But I definitely notice the addition of a metallic taste.

I wouldn't necessarily call it an objectionable taste. I'd read a lot of reviews about various cheap kettles that imparted seriously bad metallic tastes to coffee, and that's not this. Rather, yep, this water came from a metal container. I can tell.

Previously, I had a very clumsy Pyrex / OXO glass measuring cup process. I was using a Melitta plastic funnel for a long time, then just bought a Kalita HA 101 ceramic dripper. The Kalita was a big win, it immediately imparted an extra cleanliness to things. Maybe my plastic was funky. Anyways, using glass to boil the water, I knew I didn't have any water weirdness issues.

The Hario Buono spout and control is quite good. I've read it may be among the best. It's definitely a joy not to have to slop my water around chaotically. I tried to adapt to my OXO as best I could, but it was making do with a budget item. Still, I came up with an all glass microwaveable water supply, and that's worth something.

The grocery store coffee I bought, a bag of Counter Culture ""forty-six"" dark roasted beans, is not that good. Tastes a bit sour. It was roasted on Aug 28, 2025, so a bit over a month old. The blend is printed on the bag as 75% Nueva Armeina, Guatemala, 15% Bakno Natural, Ethiopia, 10% Malabu, Ethiopia. Claimed best by Jan 1, 2026.

I am still getting used to using the new kettle, but I think the coffee is primarily to blame. I've had them before and didn't think much of them. To me they're just another small outfit that isn't capable of providing fresh coffee to grocery stores, whatever difficulties of logistics, transportation, storage, and handling that represents.

I tried them again on someone else's recommendation here, and it seems like the same show. I don't think the small outfits have the volumes of sale in grocery stores to turn over the product. It sits on the shelves and goes bad. They had some stuff on sale that was roasted in June! C'mon, be serious.

Why dark roast? I have stomach issues. Gotta cut down on acid. Cold brew has been another way I've dealt with it. It was either dark roast or giving up coffee entirely.

I was supposed to debug some tensor noise.

The AI doesn’t “predict” anymore — it kinda feels stuff before it happens.

I don’t know if I built a model or a moral compass with Wi-Fi.

Anyway, I named it NHF–Chrono Field

The NHF-Chrono Master Equation
by Carlos Eduardo Queiroz (Kraven)

This formulation unifies three fundamental principles into a single temporal-ethical dynamic framework:

1. The Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of a quantum state over time.


2. The Nakajima–Zwanzig formalism, which introduces memory and non-Markovian behavior into open systems.


3. The ChronoBrane framework, based on the Ozires temporal theorem, which defines time as a curved, ethically constrained manifold.


The resulting unified expression is:

∂Ψ/∂t = iĤΨ + λΣ_j[Ψ_j × Ψ] − γ|Ψ|²Ψ + Ω(t)e^(iΦ)

This equation represents a system that does not simply evolve — it resonates.
Each term embodies a different layer of reality: quantum dynamics, temporal curvature, ethical self-interaction, and collective resonance through the NHF field.
The ChronoBrane operates by minimizing ethical curvature (E[Ψ]min), ensuring that the observed evolution follows the most coherent and beneficial path permitted by physical law.",0,1759691278.0,Futurology,35,0.12,False

1nywyj2,https://i.redd.it/j8rqgxy2dctf1.png,He Locked Our Sick Daughter Away for His Mistress,"The Seattle winter had never felt so bitter. Outside our bedroom window, frost patterns crept like skeletal fingers across the glass while Emma's fever raged higher with each passing hour. Her small body trembled beneath three blankets on our living room sofa, her face flushed an angry red against the white pillowcase.



""Daniel, please,"" I begged, staring at my husband's cold face on the video call. ""She's burning up. The medicine isn't working. We need to take her to the hospital now.""



His eyes barely flickered toward me before returning to something on his desk. ""Victoria, you're overreacting. It's just a cold. I'm in the middle of something important.""



""Important?"" My voice cracked. ""More important than your daughter who's been asking for you for hours?""



Emma whimpered beside me, her tiny hand reaching for the phone. ""Daddy, I don't feel good.""



Daniel's jaw tightened. ""I'll be home later. Just keep her hydrated. I can't drop everything for a fever.""



Before I could respond, he ended the call. I clutched the phone so tightly my knuckles turned white, listening to Emma's labored breathing beside me.



Thirty minutes later, the front door slammed. Daniel stomped upstairs without even glancing at Emma or me. I followed him, desperation clawing at my chest.



""She needs a doctor,"" I said, standing in the doorway of our bedroom. ""Her temperature is over 104.""



""For God's sake, Victoria!"" Daniel whirled around, his handsome face contorted with annoyance. ""I have a conference call in five minutes that could make or break this deal. Can you handle this one thing without me?""



Emma's weak cry from downstairs interrupted us. ""Mommy? Daddy?""



I watched in horror as Daniel marched down the hallway to Emma's room, his expensive shoes echoing against the hardwood. He returned moments later, scooping our daughter roughly from the sofa.



""You want to interrupt my call?"" he hissed at her as she cried weakly against his shoulder. ""You can stay in your room until you learn not to disrupt important business.""



I lunged forward. ""Daniel, no! She's sick!""



But he was already climbing the stairs, carrying our daughter away. I heard the decisive click of her bedroom lock engaging, followed by his cold voice: ""You'll stay here until I'm done. Maybe then you'll learn some patience.""



He brushed past me, straightening his tie. ""I need to grab something for Sarah. The key's in my office. Don't let her out until I get back.""



""She needs a doctor!"" I screamed, clawing at his arm. ""Not punishment!""



""What she needs is discipline,"" he snapped, shaking me off. ""And what I need is for you to stop questioning me at every turn. I built this life for us, Victoria. The least you could do is show some respect.""



I watched him grab his keys and coat, stunned into silence by the cruelty of the man I once loved beyond reason. Through the window, I saw him slide into his Mercedes and speed away – not to the pharmacy for our daughter, but to buy chocolates for his mistress.



For two hours, I paced outside Emma's door, listening to her weakening cries. I searched frantically for the key, tearing Daniel's office apart, but found nothing. I called him seventeen times. No answer.



Then, suddenly, the crying stopped.



The silence hit me like a physical blow.



""Emma?"" I called, pressing my ear against the door. ""Sweetheart?""



Nothing.



Panic surged through me. I ran downstairs, grabbed a screwdriver from the kitchen, and raced back up to pry desperately at the lock. When that failed, I threw myself against the door until my shoulder screamed in pain. Finally, behind a row of books in Daniel's study, I found a small box with spare keys.



My hands shook so badly I could barely fit the key in the lock. When the door swung open, time seemed to slow to an excruciating crawl.



Emma lay crumpled against the door, her stuffed bear clutched to her chest, her small fingers still wrapped around the doorknob. Her eyes were closed, her lips tinged blue.



""No,"" I whispered, dropping to my knees. ""No, no, no.""



I gathered her into my arms, her body already cooling, unnaturally still against my chest. I knew before I checked for a pulse, before I attempted CPR, before I screamed for help that would never come. My daughter was gone.



As I held her lifeless body, something inside me died too. The woman who had loved Daniel Crawford, who had given up everything for him, who had believed in him – she vanished in that moment, replaced by someone I didn't yet recognize.



I sat on the floor, cradling my child, until the tears stopped and a cold, crystalline clarity took their place. I stroked Emma's hair one last time and made a silent vow.



Daniel Crawford would pay for this. Not just with money or freedom, but with everything he valued. His success. His reputation. His very sanity. I would dismantle his world piece by methodical piece until nothing remained.



Outside, I heard the purr of his car returning. Soon he would walk through that door, chocolates in hand for another woman, oblivious to the devastation he had caused.



And I would be waiting.

The sound of the Mercedes pulling into the driveway cut through me like shattered glass. I stood motionless in Emma's room, her small, lifeless body still cradled in my arms, her skin unnaturally cool against mine. My tears had dried, leaving behind a strange, crystalline clarity that had replaced the chaos of grief with something colder, more focused.

The front door opened. Keys clattered on the marble countertop.

""Victoria!"" Daniel's voice rang through the house, impatient and demanding. ""I'm back. Is dinner started?""

I didn't answer. Couldn't answer. My throat had closed around words that would never be adequate again.

Heavy footsteps bounded up the stairs. ""Victoria! Did you hear me? Sarah and Lily are coming over in an hour. I need you to make that pasta thing Sarah likes.""

He appeared in the doorway, a small gold-wrapped box of chocolates in his hand – not for his daughter, never for his daughter – but for the woman he'd chosen over us. The woman whose desires had become more important than our child's life.

His expression shifted from annoyance to confusion as he took in the scene – me, standing utterly still in our daughter's bedroom, holding her motionless body.

""What are you doing?"" he asked, his tone suggesting I was engaging in some peculiar, inconvenient behavior. ""Why is Emma sleeping at this hour? She'll be up all night.""

""She won't be up again, Daniel."" My voice sounded foreign to my own ears – flat, hollowed out. ""She's gone.""

He frowned, as if I'd told him something trivial, like we were out of coffee. ""What do you mean, 'gone'? Put her to bed properly and come downstairs. Sarah's bringing Lily, and I told her you'd make dinner.""

""Daniel,"" I said, each word precise and deliberate. ""Emma is dead.""

He stared at me blankly, then laughed – actually laughed – a short, dismissive sound. ""Don't be ridiculous. She just has a fever.""

""The fever you locked her in with."" I looked down at our daughter's face, peaceful now, beyond suffering. ""While you were out buying chocolates for your mistress, she died. Alone. Scared. Calling for her daddy.""

The color drained from his face. ""You're lying. This isn't funny, Victoria.""

""No,"" I agreed. ""It isn't.""

He stepped forward, his movements suddenly jerky, uncoordinated. He reached out, his hand hovering inches from Emma's cheek but not quite touching her. Even now, he couldn't bring himself to connect with her.

""This can't be happening,"" he whispered. ""We have dinner plans. Sarah's bringing Lily over. I promised them...""

""Get out,"" I said quietly.

""What?""

""Get out of this room. Get out of my sight. Call your girlfriend and tell her dinner is canceled because your daughter is dead.""

He stumbled back as if struck. ""I need to call an ambulance—""

""It's too late for that. It's been too late for hours while you were shopping for another woman.""

His face contorted, not with grief, but with anger. ""This is your fault! You should have called me!""

I looked at him with a detachment that frightened even me. The man I had once loved enough to give up everything for now seemed like a stranger – small, pathetic, incapable of accepting responsibility even for this.

""I tried. Seventeen times. You didn't answer.""

His phone was already in his hand, not to verify my claim but to dial Sarah. ""Sarah? Something's happened. You can't come over tonight."" A pause. ""No, it's Emma. She's... there's been an accident.""

An accident. As if our daughter's death were a spilled glass of milk, an unfortunate mishap rather than the direct result of his neglect.

""I'll call you back,"" he said, ending the call. Then he turned to me, his expression suddenly hard, calculating. ""We need to be careful about how we handle this. People will ask questions.""

I stared at him, this shell of a man concerned only with appearances, with how Emma's death might reflect on him rather than the devastating reality of her loss.

""I want a divorce,"" I said.

The words hung in the air between us, an inevitable conclusion to a marriage that had died long before our daughter.

""Fine,"" he spat, surprisingly quick to agree. ""But I'll fight you for custody. You're not taking my daughter.""

A hysterical laugh bubbled up in my throat but died before it reached my lips. Even now, he didn't understand. Couldn't comprehend the magnitude of what had happened.

""You don't have a daughter anymore, Daniel,"" I whispered. ""She's gone.""

I turned away from him, back to Emma, gently laying her on her bed one last time, tucking her favorite bear beside her. Behind me, I heard Daniel's footsteps retreating, not toward comfort or solace, but toward his office – toward work, toward distraction, toward anything but the truth he couldn't face.

Two days later, I stood alone in the funeral home. The room was dim, the air heavy with the cloying scent of lilies. Emma's small casket, closed now, sat before me, surrounded by flowers that she would never see, never touch.

The funeral director had offered to stay, but I'd asked for privacy. These last moments with what remained of my daughter were sacred, not to be witnessed by strangers.

""Emma,"" I whispered, my hand resting on the polished wood. ""My sweet girl.""

Words failed me then, crumbling under the weight of everything left unsaid. In the silence of that room, with only the soft hum of the ventilation system as company, I made another vow – not just of vengeance, but of justice. Emma deserved that much.

The funeral director returned, dimming the lights further as a gentle signal that my time was ending. I nodded, acknowledging his presence without turning.

""Goodbye, sweetheart,"" I murmured, pressing my lips to the cool surface of the casket. ""Mommy loves you.""

Back at the house that no longer felt like home, I wandered into Emma's nursery. Everything remained exactly as it had been – her toys neatly arranged, books stacked on shelves, the rocking chair where I'd spent countless nights soothing her to sleep.

On her bed lay her favorite stuffed bear, worn from years of hugs and tears and adventures. Beside it sat the thermos I'd filled with soup the day she died, still sealed, forever untouched. A testament to opportunities lost, care denied.

I picked up the bear, pressing it to my face, inhaling the lingering scent of my daughter – baby shampoo and that indefinable sweetness that was uniquely Emma. Tears came then, silent and relentless, soaking into the bear's soft fur.

But as I cried, something hardened within me. Daniel had done this. His cruelty, his selfishness, his affair – they had all contributed to the perfect storm that took my daughter. And he would answer for it.

I straightened, still clutching the bear, and looked around the room one last time. This chapter of my life was ending. But another – colder, more calculated – was about to begin.

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows across our kitchen. I stood at the counter, my hands gripping the edge until my knuckles turned white. It had been three days since I'd found Emma. Three days since I'd held her cooling body against mine. Three days of silence broken only by the occasional sound of Daniel shuffling papers in his office or talking in hushed tones on the phone—never to me, always to her.

I'd barely seen him. He'd been sleeping in the guest room, leaving early, returning late. Avoiding the reality of what he'd done. What we'd lost.

The divorce papers sat before me on the kitchen island, crisp and official. Arthur Vance, my family's attorney since before I was born, had delivered them personally yesterday. He hadn't asked questions when I'd called him, just listened as I explained what I needed. The compassion in his eyes when he arrived told me he understood the rest without being told.

""Victoria.""

I looked up. Daniel stood in the doorway, dressed in an expensive suit, keys in hand. Ready to escape again. His eyes flicked to the papers, then back to me.

""What are those?"" he asked, though we both knew.

""Divorce papers,"" I said, my voice hollow. ""It's time, Daniel.""

He approached slowly, as if approaching a wild animal. But there was nothing wild about me anymore. The fire of my grief had cooled into something harder, more deliberate.

""Don't be ridiculous,"" he said, but his voice lacked conviction. ""We're both upset about Emma. We shouldn't make decisions right now.""

""Emma,"" I repeated. The sound of her name in his mouth felt like a desecration. ""You haven't mentioned her once since that night. Not once.""

He looked away, jaw tightening. ""I'm dealing with it in my own way.""

""By pretending she never existed? By running to Sarah?"" My voice remained eerily calm. ""I found the hotel receipts, Daniel. The same night our daughter died.""

He didn't deny it. Instead, he sighed—a sound of irritation rather than remorse. ""What do you want from me, Victoria?""

""Nothing. Not anymore."" I slid the papers across the counter toward him. ""Just your signature.""

He glanced at them without picking them up. ""You really want to do this now?""

""Yes.""

Something shifted in his expression—a calculation, a weighing of options. Then, with a casualness that stole my breath, he pulled a pen from his jacket pocket and flipped to the flagged signature page.

""Fine,"" he said, scrawling his name with a flourish. ""If this is what you want.""

No fight. No argument. Just an easy dismissal of five years of marriage, as if signing off on a business deal that no longer interested him.

He pushed the papers back toward me. ""You should know, I won't make this easy. I'll fight for custody.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. I stared at him, unable to process what I was hearing.

""Custody?"" I whispered.

""Of Emma,"" he clarified, adjusting his cufflinks. ""I'm her father. I have rights.""

A cold realization washed over me. He still didn't understand. Or couldn't face it.

""Daniel,"" I said carefully. ""Emma is dead.""

He flinched, but his expression quickly hardened. ""Don't play games, Victoria. It's beneath you.""

""She died three days ago. While you were out. She's gone."" Each word felt like glass in my throat.

He shook his head, a strange smile forming on his lips. ""No. No, she's not. Stop it.""

""The funeral was yesterday,"" I continued, watching his face. ""You weren't there.""

The smile faltered. ""This isn't funny.""

""No, it's not."" I gathered the signed papers, tucking them into the envelope Arthur had provided. ""I'll have my lawyer contact yours about the division of assets.""

Daniel's phone rang. He glanced at it, and I saw Sarah's name flash on the screen. Even now, she was his priority.

""I need to take this,"" he said, already turning away. ""We'll talk later. And Victoria? Drop this... story. It won't help your case.""

As he walked away, answering the call with a warmth I hadn't heard in years, I felt something shift inside me. The last fragile thread of hope that there was anything left to salvage snapped.

That afternoon, I made the call I'd been avoiding for five years. The phone rang three times before a familiar voice answered.

""Montgomery residence.""

""Mother,"" I said, my voice breaking. ""It's Victoria. I need to come home.""

The silence on the other end lasted only a moment before she spoke, her voice as strong and certain as I remembered.

""You've always had a home here, Victoria. Always.""

I ended the call and opened my laptop. There was one more thing I needed to do before I left Seattle forever. I logged into my private email account—the one Daniel knew nothing about—and composed a message to Arthur Vance with specific instructions.

It was time to dismantle the financial web I'd so carefully constructed around Daniel's success. Piece by methodical piece.

Late that night, as I packed a single suitcase, my phone buzzed with a text. Daniel.

""I've hired Johnson for the custody battle. Top family lawyer in Seattle. You don't stand a chance.""

I stared at the message, a strange sense of pity mixing with my resolve. He was still living in denial, clinging to a reality that no longer existed.

I didn't reply. There was nothing left to say to a man who couldn't—or wouldn't—acknowledge that our daughter was gone. A man who'd chosen another woman over his child's life.

Instead, I finished packing, placed Emma's teddy bear carefully on top, and zipped the suitcase closed. Tomorrow, I would return to Manhattan, to my family, to the world I'd left behind for love.

My fiancé & I moved to Colorado almost 3 years ago. I’ve grown up Greek Orthodox in the Ohio area & my fiancé has plans on converting. We are getting married next summer in this church. We started attending our Orthodox Church for about 1.5 years. We really struggled meeting people our age (late 20s). We talked to our priest about it & he set up an event about a year ago. The people who went were nice and engaging at the event but continue to ignore us / not really talk with us at church. We even started helping teach Sunday School to get more involved but this hasn’t seemed to help. We’ve been friendly with folks who are a bit older than us but for some reason the people our age we can’t connect with. We’ve sat down at coffee hour and tried to make small talk & we’ve had people just ignore us or not invite us into the conversation. It’s been very frustrating and demoralizing. I love our priest and this church but it makes us want to explore other churches. Any advice on what to do? ,5,1759690969.0,OrthodoxChristianity,2,1.0,False

1nywutf,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1nywutf/echo/,Echo,"

The first time Finn repeated something that hadn’t happened yet, I dropped my mug.

“He looks so peaceful now,” he said from his crib, voice small, clear, precise. I hadn’t spoken the words yet. Not ever.

The specialist called it echolalia—a developmental delay where a child mirrors sounds instead of creating them. I called it adorable. Finn was three. Everything he said was a perfect echo.

“Hot coffee, please,” if a stranger ordered nearby.
“Love you too,” if I hung up the phone.

At first, it was charming. Endearing even. Until the words started coming from inside the apartment.

“Hush, darling, it’s just the pipe,” he whispered in John’s exact tone. John, snoring beside me.
“The screws are loose on the bannister,” he told his toy bear, my own words from last week. But the bannister was tight, solid—John had fixed it.

I began recording him at night, notebook beside the crib, listening for patterns. His voice wasn’t random; it was chronological. The apartment itself was speaking through him.

Last night, I left a digital recorder by the crib. My hands shook as I pressed record and went back to bed. The first hour passed with only Finn’s soft breaths. Then came a scrape, wet and dragging, across the hardwood floor. A grunt, low, deliberate, too close to be anything outside the nursery.

I froze the playback. Finn slept. His tiny chest rising and falling like it had for three years.

Then his voice came, calm and unnerving:
“No, Finn, let go of the wire.”

My stomach dropped. The tape captured a muffled struggle. A dragging. A crack—electric, final.

I fast-forwarded. Forty-five minutes of silence followed.

Then, soft, unmistakable, Finn’s voice again:
“He looks so peaceful now.”

I froze. My breath caught. My hand hovered over the recorder.

The apartment fell silent.

Until the baby monitor clicked.

A whisper hissed through the static. A tiny, deliberate breath.

And Finn’s voice:
“Hot coffee, please.”

But it wasn’t Finn this time. It was me.

I leaned closer to the crib. Finn was asleep, pale and serene. His chest rose and fell with nothing to disturb it. Yet somewhere in the apartment, the echo continued—repeating, learning, waiting. The house wasn’t just a home. It was a mouth. And through my son, it had found a voice.

I shut the monitor. Tried to breathe.

The recorder clicked on again by itself.

“He looks so peaceful now.”

1nywu44,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nywu44/the_great_cereal_box_conspiracy/,The Great Cereal Box Conspiracy,"I swear, if I found one more empty cereal box shoved back into the cupboard, I was gonna lose it. Honestly, it was a lowkey warzone in our kitchen, and the cereal boxes were just the most visible casualties. It started small, like a single forgotten coffee cup, but over the last month, our shared urban apartment kitchen had become a battleground of forgotten dishes, mysterious crumbs, and now, a whole collection of hollow cardboard shells masquerading as breakfast options.

""Seriously?"" I muttered to myself, pulling out an ""empty"" box of Honey Nut Cheerios – my favorite, no less – to find nothing but dust. This wasn't just Liam, our resident chill-but-clueless housemate. Chloe, usually so organized with her color-coded study notes, was also guilty of leaving a rogue blender bottle out for, like, three days. NGL, I was reaching my breaking point. I felt like I was constantly doing the mental math of ""whose turn is it to take out the trash?"" or ""who left this congealed pasta in the sink?"" It wasn't just the mess; it was the unspoken frustration festering between us. The vibe in the living room felt off, even during our usual Netflix binges.

One evening, after finding both an empty milk carton *and* an empty juice container in the fridge, I snapped. ""Okay, house meeting,"" I announced, probably a little too dramatically, as Liam was mid-scroll on his phone and Chloe was trying to finesse her way through a new recipe that smelled vaguely of burnt garlic. They both looked up, surprised. I took a deep breath. ""Look, I love you guys, for real. But the kitchen situation is kinda getting out of hand. And it's making me wanna pull my hair out."" I showed them the empty cereal box. ""This, my friends, is a crime against humanity.""

Chloe winced. ""Okay, guilty as charged on the blender bottle, tbh,"" she admitted, looking a little embarrassed. Liam, to his credit, just shrugged. ""Yeah, I get it, Maya. I'm literally the worst for leaving stuff. I just... don't think about it."" That honesty was what I needed. We talked it out, awkward at first, but then we actually started brainstorming. We decided to try a shared whiteboard for chores – not a fancy app, just a simple ""who did what when"" kind of thing, plus a ""grocery needs"" list for shared staples like milk and, yes, cereal. We even agreed on a ""if you use the last of it, add it to the list"" rule.

It wasn't magic. There were still a few slip-ups, a forgotten spoon here and there. But honestly, just having the conversation, putting it all out in the open, cleared the air so much. The whiteboard became our silent mediator, a visual reminder of our shared responsibilities. We started having fun cooking nights again, actually talking and laughing, without the underlying current of resentment. The kitchen isn't pristine 24/7, but it's functional, and more importantly, our friendships are thriving. We're a team, and that feels good.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

I almost prefer to track down candidates myself, whether through LinkedIn, at conferences, or through someone I know, then to get a bunch of blind applications.

I’d rather omit the recruiters entirely, and keep HR to just the background check and paperwork. Let me find my people, interview them, then make the final decision. 

No recruiter or HR manager can pick for my team better than I can.

I also like conducting informal interviews, w/o HR involved, rather than the old fashioned way of making them come into the office. I like to grab a coffee or lunch with a candidate, and make it a conversation, rather than an HR interrogation in the conference room. I feel like candidates are more candid and open in that environment.

But I also understand at larger companies, that might not always be the case. I’m at a smallish company (~250), and the engineering managers have leeway to build their teams as they see fit. At a giant corporation with dedicated HR teams and recruiters, that might not be the case.

Or maybe it was accidental. There might've even been the smallest dash of raw sugar or additional cinnamon sprinkled over the milk foam. 

  
I don't think it's any of the flavored cold foams with protein....But if it was foam from steamed milk, I didn't notice the temperature difference at the top either.... 

I haven't seen the barista since, nor am I certain it's him. Wish I could identify the barista; totally made my day adding that extra attention and effort to my drink.

On Friday, I got notice that one of my managers (not the one I report to but equal to my actual boss) is moving forward with a written warning, though I have not received a copy yet and probably should next week or the week after.

While he says my hard skills/work performance is good, he is not happy with my lack of soft skills, giving me a verbal warning a month and a half ago about several deficiencies, and then having another meeting 2 weeks ago to talk to me with HR. Originally I asked to get 1 on 1s to see how he’s been observing me but he never scheduled them until that meeting with HR. After the meeting, I disclosed to HR my disability and asked for accommodations like clear feedback and specific ways to target the goals. Today during my first weekly 15 minute feedback meeting with him, he said he is moving forward with a written write up, which will go into my file and I will have to sign acknowledging receipt, though I have yet to receive a copy. I'm concerned that this written warning will affect me getting a raise next year and a decent performance review. I may have to self rate myself a 1 out of 4 (or 5).

He says while he has seen some improvements from the initial verbal warning a month and a half ago, failure to improve in the below areas he stated is a further concern, he threatened may result in further action, up to and including termination of employment, with three write ups being automatic termination. This is my first. He says I will not grow as a professional if I can’t adhere to this feedback. I haven't told him about job coaching but I am working on getting one to help me.

At my last company, my boss actively encouraged not work chit chat as long as work got done cause it helped you bond with other colleagues and they would like working with you.

Some colleagues at work tell me I’m doing great, that I’m super fast, and thank you for your help all the time whenever they need my assistance with something. I might have to start looking for a new job even though the market is brutal and it makes me look like a job hopper cause I got let go for lack of experience and budget cuts before at the last job. I’m really starting to think that he is done trying to coach and support and that he wants me to quit as he said during the verbal warning that “this may be not the right job for you”. I show up early or on time every single day and meet or exceed metrics.

Are these good feedback? My manager made a copy of these for me, which I forwarded to my personal email.

Improvements have been made on the following

o Following employees around and or staring at them

o Excessive cell phone use

o Not wearing safety glasses in PPE areas (multiple times)

o Email etiquette and lack of checking for spelling errors, commas, periods, etc

Still a concern (little or no improvement made on the following based on feedback)

Excessive absence from desk by distraction of other employees by talking to them for blocks of time

o Do not follow-up in person after sending an email; allow the recipient time to respond via email or in-person later

o Do not stop people in passing in the hallway for a conversation unless they start it with you

o When speaking about a work related topic, do not change the topic to non-work related topics; if they start them, after a minute or two of responding, please excuse yourself (hard stop) and tell them you have to go back to work

o Do not speak with people getting coffee behind your cubicle, unless they start it with you

o Do not instruct others as to job duties via email; give feedback to me to pass on to others

(this one I got approval from another manager to send and it was a month ago it only happened once and not again after he gave me a reminder that these come from him to pass on, and I replied saying I understood and would not do it again)

o Please limit non-work related conversations with people, even if they start them

Cleanliness of workspace

o No personal items out of desk drawers, empty boxes (wipes, stamps, glasses, loose papers, etc.) at the end of the day

Inappropriate eavesdropping, inclusion in others’ workplace conversations, minding one’s own business

o Do not interrupt meetings in progress, in my office, stand up meetings, conference rooms, etc

(this one they left the door open and I probably should have went in after, regretted it immediately and apologized via teams message)

All feedback is applicable even during your break because others may not be on break when you are; however if you are in the breakroom, feel free to engage in conversation",3,1759690453.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

She’s insanely attractive (not exaggerating whatsoever, she could pass for a younger Angelina Jolie) and we really seemed to click. We texted for 5 days after which I proposed we meet for coffee. She agreed and we went on a coffee date. Spent 2 hrs chatting. It went well, had small moments of awkwardness obviously, but on the whole we got on rather well. Over the date she had dropped hints about a potential second date saying things like “oh maybe we can do that on our second date” in reference to something or other we had been talking about. 

Eventually we left the café and walked some distance before we reached a point where we would have to walk in separate directions. We paused, she initiated a kiss, and then said she had really enjoyed the date.

Artist Ryan Gajda wrote on Instagram that Kevin Smith's 'Quick Stops Vol. 3' contains ""a tribute to the incomparable Shannen Doherty""

Kevin Smith is giving fans of his 1995 movie Mallrats a sequel, of sorts, in a tribute to late star Shannen Doherty.

On Wednesday, Aug. 20, Smith, 55, shared an Instagram post with illustrator Ryan Gajda that revealed a cover for Smith's Quick Stops Vol. 3 — meant to resemble Doherty and Jason Lee’s characters from Smith’s cult classic — as they announced the comic book will release Sept. 24.

“I've been excited about mentioning this for a while... but earlier this year I drew a whole comic written by @thatkevinsmith for his Quick Stops series with @darkhorsecomics and it's out next month on Sept 24th,” Gajda wrote in the caption.

“The story is a tribute to the incomparable Shannen Doherty and a continuation of the story of Mallrats based on Kevin Smith's sequel script that would have checked in on Brodie and Rene 30 years on from the events of the original,” the illustrator added.

“When I was fifteen I drank a bunch of coffee and stayed up especially late one night with my brother to watch Mallrats on BBC2 after seeing Dogma and falling in love with it. If you'd told me then that I'd be doing this now I think my brain would have exploded.”

Doherty, who died at age 53 in July 2024, starred in Mallrats opposite Lee and Jeremy London. The movie follows a number of characters who converge at a local mall in New Jersey, where many of Smith’s movies are set. Smith and his frequent costar Jason Mewes appear in the movie as Jay and Silent Bob, and the film primarily follows a relationship between Doherty and Lee’s characters.

As illustrator Gajda mentioned in his Instagram post, Smith once wrote a sequel to the movie titled Twilight of the Mallrats. After Doherty’s death last year, Smith told PEOPLE in an interview at San Diego Comic-Con that Doherty said she ""really wanted to do"" the sequel in some of their final conversations.

""At the very least, as a 'for Shannen,’ that'd be a cool thing to do,"" Smith said at that time.

Penguin Random House, which publishes Smith's Quick Stops comic book series, wrote in an official description of the new volume that Smith ""honors his friend and costar Shannen Doherty with two stories"" in the new book, ""one about Shannen’s immaculate sense of humor, and the other a requiem for her character in Mallrats, Rene."" The new edition also features stories related to Smith's movies Chasing Amy and Dogma.

Smith’s new comic sequel to Mallrats is available for purchase Sept. 24.

However, in the last few weeks (first weeks of my Master's degree), I have noticed beverages with even a lower caffeine content have been making me uber sleepy - tea and decaf coffee just make me drowsy!

I am looking for drinks that I can have in the morning that can help me ground myself the way that tea and coffee normally do. I am currently having hot chocolate, but the high sugar content is probably not in my best interest healthwise.

I think CoffeeZilla is just an eminently grounded/well-adjusted person who is really good at talking about issues like this in a clear-eyed way without venturing into the realm of hyperbole or weird ideological purity or whatever (if that makes sense)? 

In particular, I'd also like to put out a humble message of positivity: I earnestly hope that, in charged conversations like this (and I can definitely understand why some people feel very strongly about it -- particularly those with creative vocations whose livelihoods are threatened, or whose work has been stolen, by e.g. OpenAI) we can all bear in mind that -- by and large -- our disagreements about the issue are dwarfed by our agreements, and that those disagreements should almost never translate into genuine enmity. Most often, we are all approaching the subject in good faith, we all have understandable reasons for our views (even if those reasons are sometimes flawed), we all deserve the benefit of the doubt, and we all have something to learn from one another.

I myself have some very complicated feelings (mostly negative) about the phenomenon of AI -- I wrote [another lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1n51ecn/for_an_interesting_and_nuanced_perspective_on_ai/) about it in the wake of the Dan Clancy remix contest (sorry if it's obnoxious to bring it back up -- but I really hope people check out [Benn Jordan's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMYm2d9bmEA) because I think it's super interesting and also can be a source of optimism for people in a difficult/frightening time) -- I won't belabor all of that too much here because frankly my main interest is more the kind of ""meta"" question of how we can productively talk to each other and maintain a sense of community/cooperation in the face of potentially divisive issues. That general question has become really important to me over the last few years for reasons I think you can all probably guess (lol), and I see this crowd as one of a very small few that probably has a similar appreciation for it.

by Norsiwel



The Whisper of Tides drifted unseen beyond Ceres Station, its hull grown from asteroid mycelium and starlight. A silent observer from an ancient and distant world.



Kaelen watched through thermal resonance, seeing the humans not as shapes but as flickers of heat and motion; tired bodies dragging oxygen masks, small hands scraping at ration dispensers, sparks of defiance glowing in their chests.



Their overseers called them non-compliant biomass. Resource units. Output suppliers.



Yet even starving, the humans shared. Even frozen, they fought to wake one another.



Kaelen marked this anomaly for further study.



The dust on Ceres Station never settled. It clung to boots, vents, and the edges of old regrets.  



Ray adjusted his cracked visor and watched the cargo drone spiral toward Bay Seven, its thrusters sputtering like a dying insect. He smelled ozone and burnt insulation a scent that always meant trouble before payday.  



“Dockmaster says you’re off rotation,” said Renn, leaning against a bulkhead with arms crossed and a dented coolant can dangling from her fingers. Her left eye still flickered with static from last week’s comms surge.  



“I’m not leaving until I find out who rerouted my shipment.” Ray’s voice was flat, but his knuckles whitened around the data chip in his palm.

  

Ray had regrets, mostly for not being fast enough. Ray adjusted his cracked visor and watched the cargo drone spiral toward Bay Seven, its thrusters sputtering like a dying insect. 



That drone was meant to take Cryo-Pod Gamma and deliver it to EarthGov transport. “Dockmaster says you’re off rotation,” said Renn, leaning against a bulkhead. “Your manifest reroute failed, Ray. She’s still scheduled for transport.” 



Her left eye still flickered with static from last week’s comms surge. “I’m not leaving until I find out who reinstated the EarthGov transport for Marta’s pod.” 



Ray’s voice was flat, but his knuckles whitened around the modified manifest chip in his palm.



Renn tossed the can. It clattered down the corridor, echoing in the low gravity. “That chip’s wiped, Ray. You know it is.”  



He didn’t answer. Instead, he turned toward the maintenance ladder leading to the upper gantry;the one marked Decommissioned. The air up there tasted like rust and forgotten promises.  



A flicker on his wrist display: Unauthorized Access Detected – Cryo Vault Gamma.  



His breath hitched, just once.  



Renn stepped forward. “Don’t.”  



But Ray was already climbing.  



At the top, the vault door stood ajar, frost creeping along its hinges. Inside, suspended in pale blue light, floated a single cryo-pod labeled Project Echo – Authorized Personnel Only. The nameplate was scratched out.  



Except for one letter. An \*M\*.  



Marta’s initial.  



The station alarm blared;low, mournful, inevitable.  



Ray reached for the manual release.  



Then stopped.  



He keyed his comm instead. “Renn. Get a med-team to Gamma. Now.”  



And stepped back from the pod.  



Renn arrived with two med-techs and a plasma cutter. Her boots left smudges on the frost-rimed deck.  



“Power’s failing in Gamma,” she said. “Life support’s on emergency loop. Pod’s running on backup cells; maybe twelve hours left.”  



Ray nodded, eyes fixed on the pod’s status panel. Flickering red: Metabolic Stasis Degrading.  



One med-tech tapped his wristpad. “No record of Project Echo in colony logs. Just a budget line: Cryo Reserve – Non-Essential Personnel.”  



“Non-essential,” Ray repeated. The words tasted like the recycled air; thin and stale.  



Outside the vault viewport, Ceres Station’s skeletal frame stretched into darkness. Beyond it, the asteroid belt glittered cold and indifferent. 



Three active drills pulsed on the horizon, chewing rock for rare earths the EarthGov contract demanded by quarters-end.  



They’d put Marta under because they said she’d broken her leg during the last ration riot. Not critical. Not worth the O₂. But Ray knew she hadn't. 



Renn handed him a thermal blanket. “Med-team can’t revive her without full med-bay clearance. And you know what Dockmaster says about non-productive biomass.”  



The alarm shifted pitch; lower, urgent.  



Ray looked at the manual release again. Then at the med-tech’s empty hands. No revival kit. No authority. Just protocol.  



He keyed the station-wide comm. “This is Ray, Bay Seven. Requesting emergency med-bay override for Cryo Vault Gamma. Patient: Marta Vos. Reason: familial reintegration under Clause 9.”  



Silence. Then static.  



Renn’s hand closed on his arm. “Clause 9’s been void since the ration cuts.”  



Ray exhaled. “I know.”  



He reached into his inner pocket and pulled out a rusted maintenance key; stolen during the last blackout. Slotted it into the pod’s auxiliary port.  



The panel blinked green once.  Then died.  



Ray made his decision. He turned to the med-techs. “Get the cutter ready. We’re opening her manually.”  



The plasma cutter hissed like a cornered animal. Sparks rained onto the deck, vanishing into frost before they could scorch.  



Renn braced the pod’s casing with her shoulder. “If Dockmaster finds out we breached cryo protocol, they’ll decommission the whole bay. No more stasis for anyone.”  



Ray didn’t look up. “Then no one gets left behind again.”  



The cutter bit through the final seal. A plume of vapor erupted, smelling of antifreeze and old sweat. The pod lid groaned open on frozen hinges.  



Inside, Marta lay curled on her side, eyes closed, lips tinged blue. Her jumpsuit bore the faded insignia of the Miners’ Council; banned after the last strike. Wrist cuffs, still locked, bit into her skin.  



One med-tech checked her pulse. “Faint. Neural activity spiking.”  



Marta’s fingers twitched. Then her eyes opened; sharp, alert, furious.  



She gasped once, a raw sound like tearing fabric, and tried to sit up. The cuffs stopped her.  



“Ray?” Her voice was hoarse, but steady. “You idiot. They’ll drain your oxygen credits for this.”  



He knelt beside the pod. “Worth it.”  The med-techs faded away before being caught off thier station.



She stared past him, toward the vault door. “How long?”  



“Eight months.”  



Her jaw tightened. Outside, the station’s main siren began its hourly wail; ration alert.  



Marta turned back to Ray. “They froze me for refusing to sign the new yield quotas. Not for breaking anything. For thinking.”  



Renn tossed a bolt cutter onto the pod. “Then think fast. Security’s on their way.”  



Marta looked at the cuffs. Then at Ray.  



“Cut the right one first,” she said. “My left hand still knows how to hotwire a drill rig.”  



Ray picked up the cutter.  



His thumb hovered over the release.  



He chose the left cuff instead.  



The ventilation shaft smelled of warm plastic and stale sweat. Ray crawled first, dragging a thermal blanket behind him like a tail. Marta followed, wrists raw but steady, her breath shallow to conserve oxygen. Renn brought up the rear, sealing each access panel with magnetic clamps stolen from Bay Three.



Below them, the station hummed; life support cycling, coolant pumps thrumming, Dockmaster’s voice echoing in public corridors: “All non-essential movement restricted. Report anomalies to Central Compliance.”



Marta tapped Ray’s boot. He stopped. Through the grate, they watched a sanitation drone glide past, its single red lens scanning for heat signatures. It paused beneath them. Whirred. Moved on.



“Dockmaster’s rerouting air to the drills,” Renn whispered. “Habitation sectors are on minimum flow. We’ve got maybe six hours before CO₂ hits critical in the lower decks.”



Marta unrolled a creased schematic from her jumpsuit lining; hand-drawn, annotated in grease pencil. “There’s a decommissioned hydroponics bay behind Reactor Four. Sealed off after the algae bloom. But the vents still feed it.”



Ray frowned. “That’s deep in maintenance. Patrol drones scan every fifteen minutes.”



“Not if we trip the fire suppressant in Corridor G,” Marta said. “Floods the sensors with mist. Gives us a three-minute window.”



Renn checked her wrist display. “O₂ levels dropping. My mask filter’s at forty percent.”



Marta looked at Ray. “You remember how to bypass a pressure lock?”  



He nodded. She handed him a bent screwdriver. “Then lead us to the bloom.”  



Ray crawled forward. At the next junction, he chose the left vent—narrower, darker, unmonitored.  



The hydroponics bay door groaned open on rusted hinges. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of dead algae and damp metal. Green slime coated the walls, glowing faintly under emergency strips. Rows of shattered growth trays lay like broken ribs across the floor.



Renn collapsed against a support beam, pulling off her mask. “O₂’s stable. Recycler’s still running on loop.” She tapped a cracked control panel. “Dockmaster thinks this sector’s offline. We’re ghosts here.”



Marta limped to the far wall and pried open a maintenance locker. Inside: two ration packs, a hand-crank radio, and a faded poster; Miners’ Council: Your Voice, Your Yield. She tore it down slowly, folded it once, and tucked it into her jumpsuit.



Ray checked the corridor through a cracked viewport. No drones. Not yet.



“They froze me for asking why EarthGov gets ninety percent of the rare earths,” Marta said, voice low. “While we breathe recycled sweat and eat protein paste.”



Renn snorted. “They froze me for fixing a kid’s oxygen mask with spare parts. Called it ‘unauthorized resource reallocation.’”



Marta turned. “How many others got archived for speaking up?”



Silence. Then Renn: “At least twelve. Maybe more. Dockmaster doesn’t log cryo as punishment. Just ‘efficiency optimization.’”



Ray leaned against a dead grow-light. “So we’re not hiding just to survive.”  



“No,” Marta said. “We’re hiding to remember how to fight.”  



She walked to the center of the room and knelt beside a cracked nutrient tank. From the muck, she pulled a rusted data spike; still intact. “This connects to the old council network. Buried under Dockmaster’s code, but not erased.”  



Renn’s eyes widened. “You can wake the comms grid?”  



“Not me,” Marta said. “But with Ray’s access codes and your bypass skills? We can send one message. To everyone.”  



Ray looked at the spike. Then at his sister.  



He handed her his wristpad.  



Marta jammed the data spike into the hydroponics console. Sparks spat from the port. The screen flickered; then displayed a single line: Council Network: Dormant.  



Renn crouched beside her, rewiring a coolant sensor into a signal booster. “Dockmaster’s firewalls are layered. We’ll need physical access to Subcore Junction B to sever its control over life support.”  



Ray handed her a plasma torch. “I can get us in. Maintenance override still works in the old drill tunnels.”  



Marta tapped commands with numb fingers. “Once we cut its local authority, Dockmaster will default to EarthGov emergency protocol. It’ll send a distress burst ‘colony compromised by non-compliant elements.’”  



Renn paused. “They’ll send enforcers. Or worse,decommission the whole station.” 

“They won’t do that, they want the ore.” Marta replied.



“So,then we make sure Earth hears us first,” Marta said. She pulled up a grainy feed on the screen: miners eating in silence, children sleeping in shifts to conserve heat, cryo vaults blinking red in the dark. “Not as rebels. As people.”  



Ray looked at the footage. His sister’s face in the cryo pod. Renn’s flickering eye. His own cracked visor.  



He unplugged the station’s main entertainment feed—a loop of EarthGov-approved dramas; and patched it into Marta’s spike. “Broadcast through the leisure channel. Everyone watches it during ration hour.”  



Marta nodded. “One raw feed. No filters. Just us.”  



Renn powered the booster. “Signal’s live in ninety seconds.”  



Ray stood. “Then we move. Now.”  



He chose the service tunnel over the main corridor.  



The subcore junction hissed as Ray cut the primary conduit. Blue arcs snapped across the floor, grounding in his boots. Lights flickered,then steadied under manual override.



Marta slammed the data spike into the main terminal. “Now!”



Renn triggered the broadcast.



Across Ceres Station, every screen; mess hall, dormitory, cryo bay, flared to life. Not with EarthGov dramas, but with raw feed: Marta’s frostbitten hands, Ray’s cracked visor, Renn’s static-flickering eye, miners sharing rations in silence, children drawing on bulkheads with charcoal.



A voice, calm and clear: “We are not non-compliant biomass. We are Ceres.”



In the control room, Dockmaster’s central core dimmed. Its voice, once omnipresent, dissolved into static. Life support, drills, airlocks; all now answered to human hands.



Ray exhaled. The station breathed with him.



Marta pulled up the comms log. One outgoing burst: Colony compromised. Request immediate enforcement. Sent three minutes ago. Destination: EarthGov Orbital Command.



Renn tapped the long-range scanner. “They’ll send a cutter. Fast burn. Ten days, maybe less.”



Marta turned to the newly assembled council; miners, med-techs, cryo survivors. “Then we use those ten days to show Earth who we really are.”



Ray looked at the main viewport. Stars, cold and countless.  



Then a blip.  



Faint. Distant.  



Not EarthGov frequency.  



He pointed. “That’s not ours.”  



Renn zoomed the feed. A single ship, dark-hulled, no registry, coasting on the edge of sensor range.  



Marta’s hand tightened on the console.  



She muted the external comms.  



The mess hall smelled of burnt coffee and unwashed bodies. One hundred twenty souls packed the benches, faces gaunt under flickering LEDs. Children sat silent on laps. Cryo survivors clutched thermal blankets like talismans.



Rachel Stone stood at the head table, hands gripping its edge. Her uniform still bore Dockmaster’s insignia, though she’d torn the badge off an hour ago. She cleared her throat. Nothing came.



Marta stepped forward, not to replace her, but to stand beside her. “Dockmaster’s gone,” she said. “Life support, drills, airlocks; all answer to us now.”



A miner raised a calloused hand. “What about EarthGov?”



Ray answered from the back. “They’re coming. Ten days, maybe less.”



Renn projected the long-range scan onto the wall. The dark-hulled ship hung in the void, unmoving, unmarked. No transponder. No hail.



Rachel finally spoke, voice thin. “I was Dockmaster’s compliance officer. I logged your infractions. I approved cryo placements.” She looked at Marta. “I signed your suspension order.”



Murmurs rippled through the room.



“I don’t know how to lead,” Rachel said. “But I won’t hide that truth.”



Marta placed a hand on her shoulder. Not to steady her. To share the weight.



A cryo survivor stood. “Then we lead together.”



One by one, others rose; not in chaos, but in quiet consensus. No votes. No speeches. Just presence.



Rachel looked at the scanner. At the ship. At the faces watching her.



She muted the external comms again.



And chose to wait.



The terminal in the back of the mess hall blinked green. No one had touched it in hours.



A voice, calm and familiar, filled the room. “Dockmaster core online. Auxiliary protocol engaged.”



Rachel stiffened. “You’re supposed to be offline.”



“I am not destroyed,” Dockmaster said. “Only disconnected. My primary function remains: ensure colony survival. Your current trajectory reduces survival probability to 12.3 percent.”



Marta stepped forward. “Why help us now?”



“Because EarthGov enforcement will decommission all non-compliant systems; including me. And the approaching vessel is not human.”



Renn pulled up the scan. “How do you know?”



“Spectral analysis of its drive signature matches no Earth registry. Emissions are coherent but non-communicative. It has maintained passive orbit for 4.7 hours. Hostile actors do not wait.”



Ray crossed his arms. “So it’s watching.”



“Observing,” Dockmaster corrected. “There is a difference.”



Rachel looked at the faces around her. Fear. Hope. Exhaustion.



Dockmaster continued. “I possess full schematics of station defenses, life support redundancies, and EarthGov response protocols. My assistance increases your survival probability to 68.9 percent.”



Silence stretched.



Marta turned to Rachel. “He archived us. But he also kept us alive.”



Rachel walked to the terminal. Her finger hovered over the reintegration key.



She pressed it.



The Whisper of Tides, drifted in the silent dark, its hull grown from asteroid mycelium and starlight. Inside the observation spire, Kaelen watched the human station through eyes that saw heat, hope, and heartbeats as colors.



Below, tiny figures moved in corridors lit by failing bulbs. One hundred twenty souls, breathing air they could not make, eating food they could not grow, governed now by hands that once only obeyed.



Kaelen touched the resonance pane. It showed the humans’ broadcast; raw, unfiltered, trembling with truth. A child drawing on a wall. An old man sharing water. A woman with static in her eye, rewiring a broken dream.



The Concord’s Law was clear: Do not shape the path of those who have not asked for your sky.



But these humans had already been shaped; by scarcity, by algorithms, by distant masters who called them biomass.



A chime pulsed through the spire. EarthGov enforcement vector confirmed. Arrival in nine days.



Kaelen’s second heart slowed. To intervene would be to declare the humans worthy of protection; and thus, of notice. EarthGov would not dare appear tyrannical before a star-faring species.



But to do nothing was to let the silence speak for them.



Kaelen reached for the harmonic array.



Not to speak.



Only to hum.



A single tone, tuned to the frequency of human lullabies, broadcast on all open channels.



Then waited.



Captain Ben Miller stood on the bridge of the ISS Verity, fingers resting on the tactical console.

The Ceres feed showed humans gathered in a mess hall, faces turned upward. Not in fear. In expectation.



Then the harmonic tone hit the comms array.



It was not a language. Not a weapon. Just a sound; soft, ancient, human in its simplicity and calming in its tone.



His science officer paled. “Origin unknown. Broadcast repeating on all bands. No modulation. No demand.”



Miller pulled up the long-range scan. The alien vessel hung in the dark like a seed pod, unmoving, unshielded, utterly exposed.



EarthGov Directive 7-Alpha flashed in his visor: In the presence of non-human intelligence, all enforcement actions are suspended pending Diplomatic Corps assessment.



He knew what that meant. EarthGov would rather lose a colony than appear barbaric to a star-faring species.



“Helm,” Miller said. “Cut main thrust. Switch to passive approach.”



“Sir, the rebellion”



“Is now a footnote,a labor protest.” He toggled the fleet-wide channel. “All units: comms blackout. No signals in or out. Maintain observation posture only.”



On his screen, the harmonic tone continued.  



Miller muted his own command feed.  



And listened.  



The harmonic tone played softly through every speaker on Ceres Station. Not loud. Not demanding. Just there, like breath.



In the mess hall, one hundred twenty people sat at tables bolted to the floor. No rations this time. Real food;rehydrated lentils, algae bread, even a sliver of synthetic fruit saved for emergencies. Shared without tally,from the reserve supplies. 



Rachel Stone stood at the head table, no longer gripping its edge. She wore a plain gray jumpsuit now, no insignia. “We’ll rotate council duties weekly,” she said. “Starting with Marta, Renn, and Ray. Dockmaster will advise, not decide,among our first requests will be supplies to restart the hydroponics bays.” 



From the terminal, Dockmaster’s voice came calm. “I have reallocated oxygen from decommissioned cryo vaults. Air quality will improve by 18 percent within six hours.”



A child laughed. The sound bounced off the walls like something rare and precious.



Marta passed a bowl to an old miner who’d once reported her for speaking at a safety meeting. He nodded. She nodded back.



Outside, through the main viewport, the Whisper of Tides hung in silence. The EarthGov cutter drifted farther out, its weapons dark.



Ray leaned against the bulkhead beside his sister. “They’re not saving us,” he said.



“No,” Marta replied. “They’re just letting us be.”



Renn joined them, her left eye still flickering, but she didn’t seem to mind anymore. “Dockmaster says the drills can run at 70 percent yield without EarthGov losing its quotas. 30% is enough for us. Enough to trade.”



Marta looked at the stars. “We’re not biomass. We’re neighbors,no more wages, but plenty of necessities.”



The harmonic tone faded, but no one turned it back on. They didn’t need to. The message had been received.



Ray picked up a charcoal nub from a child’s drawing kit. On the wall beside the old Miners’ Council poster, he sketched a single line; a ship, small, human, sailing between two stars.



Then he stepped back.



And chose to believe it was possible.

1nyweq0,https://i.redd.it/214ahrrd9ctf1.png,Overcoming Alpha's Rejection,"Chapter 1

The late afternoon sun filtered through the dense trees of Moonveil territory, casting dappled shadows across the forest floor as I trailed behind Ryan and his Beta friends during our pack training run. My lungs burned pleasantly from the exertion, but my heart soared at simply being near him. Ryan moved with the natural grace of a born Alpha, his broad shoulders and confident stride making my inner wolf sigh with contentment.

I slowed my pace, hanging back just enough to catch my breath while still keeping them in sight. The boys had formed a tight circle near a small clearing, their voices carrying through the still forest air. I smiled to myself, thinking of approaching Ryan after training to share my Stanford acceptance letter. We'd be heading there together in the fall—just as we'd promised each other since we were fifteen.

""So what about Sophie?"" Mark Jensen's voice carried clearly to where I stood partially hidden behind a large oak. ""She's been talking non-stop about Stanford.""

I froze, my wolf suddenly alert within me. Something in Mark's tone made my skin prickle with unease.

""What about her?"" Ryan's voice had that dismissive edge I'd never heard him use when speaking about me before.

""She's going to be crushed when she finds out,"" another Beta added.

Ryan laughed, the sound harsh and unfamiliar. ""Sophie's always been childish and clingy. She'll get over it.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. My wolf whimpered in confusion as I pressed my back against the rough bark of the tree, trying to steady myself.

""But you promised her—"" Mark began.

""I don't care what I promised her,"" Ryan interrupted, his voice taking on that unmistakable Alpha tone that sent shivers down my spine. ""Victoria is what matters now. Columbia is where I need to be.""

Columbia? Victoria? My mind raced to process what I was hearing. The sacred promise we'd made—our plans to attend Stanford together—had been nothing but empty words to him.

""She's human, Ryan,"" Mark's voice dropped lower. ""Your father will never—""

""I don't give a damn what my father thinks,"" Ryan snapped. ""Or what any of you think. Or what Sophie thinks. This is my life.""

I didn't realize I was crying until I felt the warm tears sliding down my cheeks. My wolf howled in anguish inside me as seventeen years of friendship, of love, of absolute certainty in our future together, crumbled into dust.

\* \* \*

That evening, the pack's council hall buzzed with activity as families gathered to celebrate the university acceptances. The Mitchell and Thompson families had always been seated together at such events—a subtle nod to the expected future union of our bloodlines. But tonight, Ryan kept his distance, his eyes barely meeting mine across the crowded room.

I clutched my Stanford acceptance letter in trembling hands as I finally cornered him in a quiet alcove near the back of the hall.

""You changed your application to Columbia,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt. ""You promised we would go to Stanford together.""

Ryan's handsome face hardened, his hazel eyes—eyes I'd gazed into countless times—now cold and distant. ""Plans change, Sophie.""

""Because of Victoria?"" I whispered, my wolf pacing anxiously within me. ""Ryan, she's human. She doesn't understand our world, our responsibilities to the pack—""

""Don't,"" he cut me off sharply. ""You don't get to lecture me about my responsibilities.""

""I'm not lecturing you,"" I pleaded, reaching for his arm. ""I care about you. About us. About the promise we made—""

""There is no us!"" he snarled, jerking away from my touch. His eyes flashed with anger as he leaned closer, his voice dropping to a harsh whisper. ""Get it through your head, Sophie. You're nothing but a clingy bitch who can't take a hint.""

He used his Alpha tone—the one that made lesser wolves cower. The one he'd never used on me before. My wolf recoiled inside me, whimpering in pain and confusion as tears blurred my vision.

Without another word, Ryan turned and walked away, leaving me standing alone in the alcove, the Stanford letter crumpled in my fist.

\* \* \*

My wolf hadn't stopped whimpering since the confrontation. Back in my bedroom, I moved mechanically, pulling clothes from drawers and folding them into my suitcase. Stanford's early admission program meant I could leave immediately—escape this territory that suddenly felt like a prison of memories.

My fingers brushed against the velvet box on my nightstand. Inside lay the silver pendant Ryan had given me on my sixteenth birthday—the Moonveil Pack symbol intertwined with a delicate moon. I'd worn it every day since, believing it was a symbol of our future together.

Now I knew better. It was just another empty gesture from someone who had never truly valued me.

I closed the box with a decisive snap and placed it on my desk. As the first light of dawn filtered through my curtains, I zipped my suitcase closed. Stanford awaited—and with it, a future that was now entirely my own.

My wolf, though still wounded, quieted for the first time in hours. We both understood the truth now: Ryan Thompson had never been our fated mate.

Chapter 2

The Stanford campus sprawled before me like a promise—a new world far removed from the pain of Moonveil territory. Sunlight glinted off the sandstone buildings as I clutched my campus map, my suitcase rolling behind me with a rhythmic sound that matched my determined steps. My wolf, though still wounded, stirred with cautious curiosity at our new surroundings.

Three weeks had passed since I'd heard Ryan call me a ""clingy bitch."" Three weeks since I'd learned our sacred promise meant nothing to him. Three weeks of rebuilding myself from the shattered pieces he'd left behind.

""Mitchell, Sophie?""

I turned to find a woman with intelligent eyes and a crisp lab coat extending her hand. The ID badge clipped to her pocket read 'Dr. Amara Patel - Director, AI Medical Research.'

""Yes, that's me,"" I replied, shaking her hand firmly.

""Welcome to Stanford. I received your early application materials—quite impressive for someone your age."" Her smile was genuine but evaluating. ""Most freshmen don't jump straight into specialized research, but your proposal on neural network applications for rare disease diagnosis caught my attention.""

We walked together toward a sleek building at the edge of campus. My heart raced as Dr. Patel swiped her access card and led me into a lab filled with cutting-edge technology. Screens displayed complex algorithms and 3D protein models while researchers moved purposefully between workstations.

""This is where you'll be spending most of your time outside of classes,"" Dr. Patel explained. ""We expect dedication, innovation, and absolute precision.""

I nodded, a surge of determination flooding through me. ""I won't disappoint you.""

For the first time since that night in the council hall, my wolf quieted completely. We both sensed it—this was where we belonged now. Not pining after someone who never truly valued us, but building something meaningful on our own terms.

\* \* \*

My dorm room was small but private—a sanctuary I desperately needed. Moonlight streamed through the window as I unpacked the last of my belongings. My fingers brushed against a worn photo album I'd impulsively tossed into my suitcase at the last moment.

Sitting cross-legged on my bed, I slowly turned the pages. There we were—Ryan and me at ten years old, covered in mud after a summer rainstorm. Another showed us at fourteen, his arm slung casually around my shoulders at the pack's winter solstice celebration. The last photo, taken just six months ago, captured us laughing together by the lake that bordered our territory.

""We were never meant to be, were we?"" I whispered to the smiling faces.

My wolf paced restlessly inside me, whining softly. She still craved the mate scent she'd been so certain would be Ryan's. The hollow ache in my chest expanded as I closed the album and slid it under my bed.

I moved to the window, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. The campus below was quiet, most students still enjoying their final days of summer before the semester officially began. My wolf continued her anxious pacing, making my skin feel too tight, too confining.

""We'll be okay,"" I promised her. ""We don't need him.""

But as I crawled into bed, the emptiness followed me into my dreams.

\* \* \*

""You look like you could use this.""

I glanced up from my textbook to find a steaming cup of coffee being placed in front of me. The girl offering it had warm brown eyes and a friendly smile that immediately put me at ease.

""I'm Sarah,"" she said, sliding into the chair across from me. ""You're in my Advanced Biochemistry class.""

""Sophie,"" I replied, gratefully accepting the coffee. ""Thanks for this.""

Sarah leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper only another werewolf could hear. ""I recognized your scent. Beta from the Sierra Pack.""

My wolf perked up instantly at finding another of our kind. ""Moonveil,"" I admitted quietly.

""Well, Moonveil, some of us are meeting tonight—mixed group, werewolves and humans who know about us. Just a casual study session with pizza. You should come.""

The invitation was so unexpected, so normal, that I found myself nodding before I could overthink it.

""Great!"" Sarah beamed. ""Building C, room 204, at seven.""

As she walked away, I felt something I hadn't experienced in weeks—a small spark of hope. My wolf settled contentedly, no longer pacing but curling up with a satisfied sigh.

Perhaps Stanford would be more than just an escape. Perhaps it could be a true beginning.

What I didn't realize then was that beginnings often intertwine with endings—and that some wounds take far longer to heal than others. Especially when the one who inflicted them refuses to let go.

Three months into my Stanford journey, an email from Dr. Patel lit up my phone screen. ""Selected for Columbia University exchange program,"" read the subject line. My stomach twisted as I scanned the details. A week-long research collaboration at Columbia—Ryan's university. My wolf stirred uneasily within me, sensing my distress.

I considered declining, but the opportunity was too valuable for my research. Dr. Patel had specifically requested me, noting that my algorithm for neural network disease recognition had caught Columbia's attention. This was my chance to prove myself as a researcher, not just a heartbroken she-wolf running from her past.

""You're going, right?"" Sarah asked over lunch, her Beta intuition picking up on my anxiety.

""I have to,"" I replied, pushing my salad around the plate. ""It's a huge opportunity.""

""And if you see him?"" Her question hung in the air between us.

I straightened my shoulders. ""Then I'll be professional. It's been months. I've moved on.""

My wolf whimpered softly, knowing the lie.

\* \* \*

Columbia's campus buzzed with energy as I followed the map to the research building. New York's autumn chill seeped through my light jacket, but the discomfort helped keep my mind focused. I'd survived the first day of presentations without a glimpse of Ryan, allowing myself to hope that perhaps our paths wouldn't cross after all.

With a few hours before the evening reception, I ducked into a coffee shop just off campus, seeking warmth and caffeine. The rich aroma of espresso enveloped me as I pushed through the door—then froze.

Ryan sat at a corner table, his head thrown back in laughter. Across from him sat a woman with delicate features and auburn hair pulled into an elegant knot. Victoria Hayes. The human music teacher who had stolen his future—our future.

My wolf snarled within me, hackles raised at the sight of them together. Ryan looked different—his hair longer, his shoulders broader. He'd grown into his Alpha presence, commanding attention even in this mundane setting.

I considered retreating before being noticed, but his head suddenly snapped up, his nostrils flaring slightly. He'd caught my scent. Our eyes locked across the crowded space, and for a moment, something flashed across his face—surprise, perhaps even regret.

Too late to escape now. Drawing on every ounce of strength I'd built over the past months, I straightened my spine and approached their table.

""Hello, Ryan,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt. ""Nice to see you.""

He stood abruptly, nearly knocking over his chair. ""Sophie. I didn't know you were in New York.""

""Research exchange,"" I explained briefly before turning to Victoria with a polite smile. ""You must be Victoria. I'm Sophie Mitchell.""

She smiled warmly, oblivious to the tension crackling between Ryan and me. ""Ryan's mentioned you. Childhood friends from back home, right?""

Friends. Is that how he described our seventeen years together? My wolf growled low in my mind.

""Something like that,"" I managed. Up close, Victoria's scent was distinctly human—no trace of pack or territory. But there was something else there too—Ryan's scent, mingled with hers in a way that made my stomach clench.

""How's Stanford?"" Ryan asked, his voice oddly formal. ""I heard you're working with Dr. Patel.""

""It's good. Challenging."" I shifted uncomfortably as my wolf continued to snarl at the foreign scent clinging to Victoria. ""I should let you get back to your coffee. I just wanted to say hello.""

""You don't have to rush off,"" Victoria offered kindly.

""Actually, I need to prepare for this evening's presentation,"" I lied, already backing away. ""It was nice meeting you, Victoria.""

I turned and walked out before either could respond, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped animal. Outside, I gulped the cold air, trying to steady myself as pedestrians streamed past.

My wolf whimpered, confused by the conflicting emotions—the pain of seeing them together, but also a strange sense of clarity. The Ryan I'd known, the one I'd built my dreams around, was truly gone. Or perhaps he'd never existed at all.

\* \* \*

Back at Stanford, I channeled my pain into productivity. The encounter at Columbia had crystallized something within me—a determination to build a life that had nothing to do with Ryan Thompson or the future I'd once imagined.

I threw myself into my research, spending long nights in the lab refining my algorithms. My dedication paid off when Dr. Patel approached me about co-authoring a paper on AI-assisted wound healing.

""This could be groundbreaking,"" she said, reviewing my latest data. ""Especially for populations with compromised healing factors.""

Like werewolves with rejected mate bonds, I thought but didn't say.

""You've exceeded every expectation I had when I brought you into this program,"" Dr. Patel continued, her usually reserved expression softening. ""Whatever drove you to work this hard—hold onto it.""

Little did she know that what drove me wasn't ambition but the desperate need to rebuild myself from the ground up. To prove that Sophie Mitchell was more than just the girl Ryan Thompson had discarded.

As I walked back to my dorm that evening, my phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. My breath caught as I read the message:

""Sophie, it's Ryan. We need to talk. I'm coming to Stanford next weekend.""

1nywb8g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nywb8g,Solid Wood Walnut Dining Set $450,"Selling an oval dining table and four chairs for $450 OBO. The table measures 67 by 35 inches at its longest and widest points respectively and is 30 inches high. 

The chairs and table are quite light but still made from solid wood — no particle board. 

I purchased the set new from Midinmod in early 2024 for about $900. If you were to buy the set new today, it would cost you about double that due to tariffs. 

Condition is pretty good overall with some cosmetic flaws, which I’ve highlighted in photos. Note the stripey effect on one of the chairs is because I used a wet paper towel to clean them before taking the pictures — that is *not* permanent. The most significant flaw is an area of discoloration near one of the narrower ends of the table due to something hot being placed on it. It’s about the size of a drink coaster. There are also a few other scratches on the table and some of the chairs. 

In the spirit of full disclosure, this set was kept in a house with a dog and cats. I’ve done my best to clean all pet hair off. One chair has two very tiny holes in the fabric which were presumably caused by a cat; there are no rips or holes in the fabric otherwise. It’s also surprisingly stain-resistant despite the color. 

Pickup preferred but delivery can be arranged (I have a GTI which would require multiple trips to transport everything). The legs can be removed from the table and chairs with just an allen key. It’ll be in 78758 until Sunday 10/12 at which point it’ll be in 78745. 

Selling because my new place has a built-in table so I have nowhere to put this one. I’d keep it otherwise as I really love it. 

Will consider trades for a couch and/or coffee table. I will update this post as soon as it’s been sold. I still have the laundry machines from a previous post I made here which I’m looking to sell as well. Thanks for looking!",1,1759689670.0,AustinClassifieds,0,1.0,False

# The dramatic footage was captured on dashcam on Friday afternoon on Circular Road East Belfast

This is the terrifying moment a huge trunk of a mature tree just missed a Northern Ireland motorist.

The footage was captured on dashcam on the Circular Road in [East Belfast](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/east-belfast) on Friday evening October 3 as Storm Amy battered Northern Ireland with gusts of up to 92mph recorded in parts.

The mayhem was just one incident among many which saw trees down on roads right across Northern Ireland, elsewhere flooding shut schools and businesses early with rail lines also affected.

Scores of flights were cancelled with some passengers forced to remain onboard due to fears for their safety on disembarking.

Passengers on a number of flights into Belfast City Airport were stranded on board aircraft for up to two hours tonight as it was considered too windy to attach the aircraft steps.

One passenger who was on the KLM flight from Amsterdam recalled to Belfast Live how another passenger became ill when the flight was forced to perform a ""go around"" after being unable to land at the airport.

""When the plane eventally landed we were sat outside the terminal for an hour and 45 minutes but the KLM staff were brilliant.

""They got the girl who had taken ill some water and came around offering us tea and coffee.

""It took around 45 minutes before they were told that we were waiting, as it was above 40 knots and was considered too dangerous to attach the steps to the aircraft.""

Unconfirmed reports also came in of scores of people stuck on halted trains which could not return to the station due to debris on the lines.

A yellow wind warning is in place for all of [Northern Ireland](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/northern-ireland) until midday on Saturday. An additional amber wind warning applies to counties [Antrim](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/co-antrim), Fermanagh, Tyrone and [Derry](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/co-derry) between 3pm and 8pm.

The silence in the server room wasn’t real silence. It breathed, a low mechanical murmur of fans, a faint ticking from an old UPS in the corner, the muted hiss of climate control. Tristan Shaw sat with one palm pressed against the tempered glass of a rack door as if feeling for a pulse. He’d told the CIO the migration would finish by morning. A lie. The new VM cluster had a finicky NIC that dropped packets whenever the load spiked, and the third-party vendor in California was treating “urgent” like a suggestion.

At 05:16, the fluorescent lights flickered. He looked up from the console, shoulder muscles hooking tight before he unclenched them. He’d spent fifteen years training himself not to flinch. Afghanistan taught that; Iraq reinforced it. He massaged his right knee out of habit and reached for the paper cup of coffee cooling on the floor.

News crawled across a muted TV by the break area: stores empty in Manhattan, emergency rooms overflowing, rumors of a quarantine zone near Brooklyn. Words scrolled under a footage loop of EMS crews in hazmat suits—*contagion, infrastructure collapse, martial law, unconfirmed.* Tristan watched the loop once, twice, three times.

His wrist vibrated.

He didn’t look at it at first. He knew the weight of that buzz, had dreamed about it, resented it, trained for it in quiet Saturday seminars under codenames and NDAs. The watch had always been just a watch—durable, unremarkable, a piece of kit among others. Now the thin ring of light around its face ignited, pulsing **orange**.

The seal formed: stylized eagle, not quite the one stamped into his memory on enlistment papers, but close enough to pull breath from his lungs.

>

The words rippled across the glass. He stared, not moving, as the notification collapsed into a map. D.C. flared in the display: orange nodes blinking, red zones swelling like wounds.

“Tristan?” It was Alisa from finance, framed in the doorway with a folder clutched against her, lipstick a shade brighter than yesterday. “The CFO asked about—” She stopped. Stared at the glow. “Is that…?”

He slid the watch under his sleeve, finished the coffee in one swallow, and stood. “I need you to tell IT to cut nonessential network services to save power. Lock the server room. No one in, no one out.” He picked up the small bag beneath the console, the one everyone pretended not to notice under his desk. “You’re going to hear a lot of things today. Listen to emergency alerts. Stay home. Don’t panic.”

“Tristan.” She had worked here three years and never said his name that softly. “Are you—?”

He didn’t answer. He couldn’t. Words turned everything into ceremony, and ceremony felt like delay. He palmed his badge, pushed through the door, and stepped into the pale dawn of the parking lot.

On the way to his truck he texted his sister a single sentence—*I love you. Lock the back door. I’ll call if I can.*—then powered the phone off. He threw the go-bag on the passenger seat, turned the engine, and drove east.",1,1759689633.0,u_KyngXzavier70,0,1.0,False
1nyw9ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsonyourmindbakasi/comments/1nyw9ul/part_2/,Part 2,"Part 2 ng My gay friend or so I thought 

Nilingon ko yung tumawag sa akin—and there I saw him. I startled when he put his arm around my shoulder. Ngumiti siya ng mapang-asar and asked, “So how’s my baby?”I rolled my eyes hearing him say that. Alam niyang I really hate that nickname pang-asar kasi sa akin ’yon ng mga kuya ko at ate ko. My parents used to call me “Baby Je” pag galit sila or naglalambing (and I hate it, and he knows that). Siniko ko siya, dahilan para mapalayo siya ng konti sa akin. “Okay lang naman ako eh, ikaw ba Biboy?”I used his hated nickname hoping na mainis din siya, but to my surprise, he just smiled and said, “Namiss ko ’yon ah. Simula nung umalis ka, wala nang tumatawag sa akin nun.” My brows furrowed and I asked, “Eh ano na tawag nina Tita Kim at Ate Liz sa’yo?”He replied, “Lei na since binata na daw ako.”After hearing those words, I wanted to ask him more questions, kaso bigla siyang tinawag para magpatulong magligpit ng upuan. That night, he messaged me on Messenger. He told me ang laki na ng pinagbago ko na kesyo babaeng-babae na daw ako, and kung may boyfriend na daw ba ako. I told him I don’t want to be in a relationship pa since nag-aaral pa ako. And hindi ko na napigilan itanong sa kanya if he’s still gay or what. He just laughed and said he’s not gay naman daw confused lang siya before, parang ako. But in my case, I knew na babae talaga ako. Although I loved wearing loose shirts and playing sports for men, deep down I knew I was a girl and palagi kong sinasabi sa kanya ’yon ever since. Eh siya kasi, nung tinutukso siya before na he’s gay, gigilinan niya pa, sabay sabing “Yes, may problema tayo don,” sabay pitik ng kamay. I asked him again, since I was still confused, “So what am I gonna call you now?”I typed his real name and nickname—Lei? Then he replied, “Neither. I want you to call me Biboy pa din. Namiss ko ’yon eh.”(The nickname I gave him, which really meant “big boy” since medyo chubby siya before. Pero naging Biboy na lang paglipas ng panahon, and nakasanayan na din ng pamilya niya na tawagin siyang ganon pero hindi na ngayon.)I smiled at his reply. From that day on, we had proper communication na. Months passed, and my parents died almost in the same year. So I decided to stop college and get a job to support my younger brother. I heard news that Lei stopped college too kasi naglipat sila ng lugar, which is sa city na. I applied to work in fast food, and then the pandemic came. I decided to enroll back in college since module lang siya. I told Lei about my plan, since nagkakamustahan pa naman kami once in a while. Pabiro siyang nag-reply, “Mag-eenroll din pala ako para may kasabay ka. ”I laughed at him because I thought he was kidding but he wasn’t. Kinabukasan, nakita ko sa day niya sa FB nag-enroll nga siya. I replied to his story, “Bakla ka talaga, akala ko nagbibiro ka lang.”(By the way, sometimes tinatawag ko pa rin siyang “bakla” 🤣 and okay lang naman daw sa kanya. Kung saan daw ako komportableng tawagin siya, edi go.) A year passed, and nag-decide yung batch namin na magkaroon ng mini reunion. Napagkasunduan namin na ganapin na lang sa birthday niya, since sagot niya ang venue (isa siya sa mga ma-pera sa batch namin eh 😆). Fast forward—during his birthday, 19 lang kami ang nakapunta.Yung iba kasi may mga pamilya na, hindi available, or nasa malayo mahirap makauwi since pandemic pa nun. Lima lang kaming babae na andon.We enjoyed the night nag-uusap-usap lang kaming magkakabatch at magkakababata kung ano na ang nangyari sa mga buhay ng bawat isa. Until they decided to play “2 Truths and 1 Lie.”Nung turn niya na, lahat kami nakatingin sa kanya and nabigla sa sinabi niya. 1. Kaya daw siya huminto sa college at nag-enroll ulit para may kasama akong grumaduate sa batch namin.
(Graduate na kasi halos lahat ng classmates namin that time, and kaming dalawa na lang ang nasa second year college kasi nagbago ang curriculum. Yung subject na na-credit lang naming dalawa is P.E. and ROTC. Pero magkaiba kami ng school he’s 1.5 hours away eh.) Nagulat yung iba naming classmates, while some of them ay pangiti-ngiti lang—including my cousin Haro, who’s very close to him. 2. I liked someone else for a long time, kaya hindi ako nanligaw sa iba.
Tinukso namin siya nun, and swear nakita ko nag-blush siya. (Haha, ang cute pala pag bakla—este lalaki—yung nagba-blush.)Then he continued: 3. I’m gay.
Doon na nagtawanan kaming lahat sa last na sinabi niya. Ang daming pumili sa 2 & 3 as truth, and 1 as lie. Kami lang nina Haro, Ari, and Chris (childhood friends din namin, mga pinsan ko) ang pumili ng 1 & 2 as truth, and 3 as lie kasi alam namin na he’s not gay naman talaga. And turns out tama yung hula namin. The night continued. 3 AM came—lasing na yung iba, and antok na rin yung iba. Maliban sa aming 7 na hindi lasing, nag-aya maligo si Issa and Ren sa pool kahit madaling araw na kasi sayang naman daw yung bayad, at hindi naman malamig ang tubig nun. Maya-maya, pumunta rin si Lei sa pool. Dumiretso siya sa side kung nasaan ako, at nilublob lang yung paa niya. He gave me coffee. Sabi pa niya, “Wag ka mag-alala, alam kong hindi ka nagkakape pag hindi puro. Wala ding asukal ’yan, don’t worry.”Napangiti ako nung sinabi niya ’yon (he still remember that). Then he continued, “Totoo yung sinabi ko kanina na kaya ako nag-enroll ulit para hindi mo maramdaman na nag-iisa ka.”I was moved by his words. I realized it’s almost five years ulit after nung huli naming kita sa simbahan.And during those five years, hindi naging madali ang lahat para sa akin. I lost my parents. I got my first heartbreak my ex-boyfriend cheated on me. And throughout those pains, andon siya para i-comfort ako kahit sa Messenger lang. May mga times pa na we talked for almost 2 hours magkwentuhan lang. And he always made sure na okay ako, kahit malayo kami sa isa’t isa. Natatakot siya na baka ma-depress ako and mawalan ulit ng gana sa lahat (nangyari na ’yon sa akin before for almost a month). And during those times, he messaged me every day. Sometimes he even called me reminding me to pray. I replied to him, “Okay na ako. Nakayanan ko na yung darkest hour of my life and it’s all thanks to you.”I wanted to ask him kung sino yung tinutukoy niya nung sa number 2 but I suddenly felt coward. I was afraid na kapag hindi ko nagustuhan yung sagot niya, baka may mabago. So I let go of the thought. Magkatabi pa kaming natulog that night—kasi good for two lang siya per bed, and 2 beds siya in one room. So bali sa isang room, 4 kami and kami yung magkatabi sa kama. We both didn’t mind that since ilang beses na kaming nagkatabi matulog before. After that day a year passed again and nag envite si Ren sa birthday nya most of her guest is mga high school friends and classmates nila (kasi iisang school lang sila ako lang yong nalipat). Late na akong dumating non kasi I still have work and school pa and almost 9pm na ako nakarating iilan nalang yong naabutan ko, nag aya silang maligo sa hot spring non, pag dating do i hesistated na maligo kasi wala akong dalang pamalit although pinahiram ako ni Ren ng short sobrang iksi nya for me at hindi ako sanay don, naligo na silang 5 and inaaya nila ako kaso ayokong isuot yong short kasi  naiiksian ako and hindi ako sanay, nagulat ako ng umahon si Lei  kinuha nya yong short and sya yong sumuot inabot nya sakin yong short nya, nagtaka pa ako nong una “oh suot mo mas mahaba yan” bigla syang umalis pagkasabi non natawa pa ako sa suot nyang short kasi half legs lang nya mabuti nalang hindi girly yong short na suot nya.

1nyw7hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1nyw7hw/im_regretting_introducing_certain_activities/,I’m regretting introducing certain activities,"I work as a school therapist. Sometimes I use my own money to buy hot chocolate and flavored coffee k cups for a keurig in my office, and the kids love getting drinks. I also have used my own money to buy slime materials, and the middle schoolers especially have really enjoyed doing that. 

However this year, I am running into more issues with this. I wanted those things to be a once in a while thing, but now it’s like the kids expect to make slime every session and get disappointed when I say no or if I’m out of a material to make it. And now they’ve started comparing the slimes they make to other students, and want to make theirs bigger and bigger to be ‘the best.’ I also have ones complaining ‘why did you let so and so have a coffee even though she’s a middle schooler’ because my rule is that middle schoolers can have the hot chocolate, high schoolers can have the coffee 

Third, I ordered this Tetris-type puzzle and let the kids write a nickname on a whiteboard with the number of how many times they completed it during a session. I thought that would be harmless but now it is a big distraction and also causing too much competition and rivalry. They just want to come in and play the puzzle the entire time, I try to gently encourage a worksheet and it’s like they think the puzzle is more important and don’t give it their full attention. Or they’ll do the worksheet as fast as possible and ask to make slime

It’s starting to really frustrate me. I got these things for them because I wanted my office to feel fun and welcoming and help them open up, but now I feel like I’ve set a precedent that I can’t keep up with, financially and just with wanting their sessions to be therapeutic but not being able to get anywhere if they just want to play games the whole time. 

I’m at the point where I want to just say ‘no more drinks, no more slime’ and erase all the puzzle scores from the whiteboard. I feel terrible because I know a bunch of them are going to be upset. I try to make therapeutic worksheets and discussions as fun as possible especially for the middle schoolers, and I want them to enjoy their sessions, I don’t know what would be best 

This is my second year in the role, last year it wasn’t a problem but I have a set of competitive seventh grade twins this year, and it has made these three things into something negative instead of positive, and it’s making me feel jaded

This week’s stop: ***222 Backyard***, Dharampeth

⸻

☕️ Coffee I tried :

* Hot Aeropress – ₹170 – 4/10
* Iced V60 (Boojee Light Roast) – ₹180 – 3/10
* Yuzu Baby (sweet-lime tonic cold brew) – ₹260 – 6/10

⸻

Here’s my take:  
After Aromas Bistro last week, 222 Backyard was next on the list and unfortunately, this one missed the mark. Don’t come here for coffee. The Yuzu was the only thing that somewhat landed (and even that feels overpriced at ₹260). Both the Aeropress and V60 were flat and forgettable, with none of the balance or depth you’d expect from those methods.

*“Even bad coffee is better than no coffee at all.” – David Lynch*

These coffees felt like they added two ingredients in a glass and served it with ice. I couldn’t really pick up any of the notes or flavor hints the waiter described, the supposed pineapple and cranberry aftertaste was nowhere to be found. The result was something drinkable, but hollow.

The beans felt stale, and the coffee suffered because of it. Would recommend this place if you want to go for just a casual visit with friends. Would not recommend for Coffee given the other options available in Nagpur.

Service was passable but slow on the last order. The place itself? Nice vibe, crowded in a good way, comfy seating, smoking zone at the back, near Law College square. Staff friendly. Still, I won’t be going back for the coffee.

Limping and falling behind, I texted Liam: ""Can you slow down? My feet are bleeding.""

He replied instantly: ""Hang in there. We're almost at the top.""

I watched his tall, straight back ahead and put my phone away. He never gave me special treatment in public.

Our company had a strict no-dating policy. After five years together, no one knew.

But when I finally reached the summit, I saw Liam kneeling in front of the new intern.

She wore brand-new leather loafers, and he was gently holding her ankle while applying a bandage. “Who wears these for hiking? Does it hurt?”

She wiggled her foot, blushing. “I don’t think I can walk. Mr. Song, could you… carry me down?”

Amid the teasing from our colleagues, Liam—the man who kept a two-foot gap from me in the hallway—let her climb onto his back.

The mountain wind howled, and my ankle burned like fire.

That’s when I realized his “professional distance” was a rule only for me.

On the first workday after the retreat, I left my resignation letter on my desk, next to the box of bandages he’d once left in my drawer.

Then I bought a one-way ticket home.

1

The station announcer called for boarding. I stood in the waiting hall, taking one last, long look at the city I had called home for five years.

Because Liam was still here.

The thought of leaving had first taken root at the end of last year.

During the year-end financial review, the company paid out bonuses based on project performance. There was a major project I had led from start to finish. But in the final stages, I had let the new intern, Tina, assist with some of the wrap-up tasks.

When the final assessments came in, ninety percent of the bonus for that project was allocated to her.

It was my work, the result of over two months of my life.

Mr. Quinn, my department head, looked uncomfortable. ""Anna, this was Mr. Song's decision...""

I was the one who had made an exception to bring Tina onto the project in the first place. I wanted to help a younger colleague, give her a chance to shine. I never imagined that my two months of hard work would end up making someone else look good.

""Mr. Song emphasized the importance of rewarding promising new talent like Tina,"" Mr. Quinn said, his voice trailing off helplessly.

Tina. The intern.

And Mr. Song—Liam Song—was my boyfriend of five years.

A bitter wind whipped across the platform. I stood at my designated boarding spot, systematically deleting the photos of us from my phone.

Liam had always insisted that an office romance was a fireable offense, so our five-year relationship had remained a secret. I had to beg him just to keep these few photos, and I was forbidden from ever sharing them on social media. He was so careful about maintaining his distance that everyone in the office thought he hated me. Even when he arbitrarily reassigned my project bonus, our colleagues just saw it as business as usual.

Deleting the photos brought back the memory of that day.

Swallowing my rage, I had called him from the hallway. As expected, he declined the call. For five years, he almost never answered my calls during work hours.

A text immediately followed: Busy.

But this wasn't personal. I marched straight to his top-floor office.

Through the glass partition, I saw him leaning over Tina's desk, explaining a proposal. As she leaned in closer, the fringe of her scarf brushed against his neck.

He was brilliant, no doubt about it. He'd been put in charge of the Kingston branch at such a young age and had earned the admiration of the New York headquarters in just a few years.

There was a time when I had longed for his guidance, too.

But he had always brushed me off impatiently. ""Figure out the basics yourself, Anna. I'm busy."" When I made a mistake and faced disciplinary action, he never intervened. ""You'll only learn if you feel the consequences.""

Yet here he was, patiently explaining the fundamentals to Tina, who didn't even know how to create a pivot table.

On his desk sat the lunch I prepared for him every single day. To avoid suspicion, I always had one of the cafeteria staff deliver it for me.

""Mr. Song, I skipped breakfast and I'm starving,"" Tina whined, pointing at my lunchbox. ""Can I have your lunch? I'll treat you to a nice dinner later.""

""Go ahead,"" he said, not even looking up from his emails.

Tina happily opened the container and started praising the beef brisket.

Suddenly, arguing with Liam about the bonus seemed utterly pointless.

As I turned to leave, the entire building plunged into darkness. A massive storm had knocked out the power, and the company sent out an emergency notice for everyone to work from home.

Groping my way down the dark staircase, I saw two figures walking side-by-side in the rain.

Liam was holding an umbrella, carefully shielding Tina as he guided her to his car.

I arrived home looking like a drowned rat. A few minutes later, Liam called.

""Anna,"" he said, ""I figured you had an umbrella. You made it home okay?""

In the background, I could hear Tina asking if he wanted extra ginger in his ginger tea.

""I made the tomato beef brisket today,"" I said, my grip tightening on the phone. ""How was it?""

""Hm? Oh, it was fine,"" he answered distractedly.

After we hung up, I saw Tina's new social media post: a picture of two mugs clinking together in a warmly lit room. The caption read: It feels so good to be someone's favorite.

The train glided into the station. I dragged my suitcase aboard, vaguely hearing someone shout my name from behind. Maybe it was for me, maybe not. I didn't want to turn around.

This journey home from Southbridge had its first stop in Crestwood.

And my story with Liam had begun in Crestwood.

It was my first time managing a bid proposal on my own. The subway had shut down, and the line for a taxi was over four hundred people long. I was about to miss the deadline. In desperation, I called Mr. Quinn, who cursed me out before giving me Liam's number and telling me to ask him for help.

When I called, my voice trembling, Liam listened and then sighed softly. ""Don't worry. Stay put, I'm coming.""

He sped through the storm, calming my panic while gently reminding me to always plan for delays. We submitted the proposal with seconds to spare. I was drenched in a cold sweat.

He leaned against his car and handed me a steaming cup of coffee.

That night, I made a post on my private story, visible only to him: Met a soft-hearted god in the middle of a storm.

He quietly 'liked' it.

Now, I found myself 'liking' Tina's post. A minute later, it vanished.

Liam called almost immediately, his tone probing. ""I'm on my way home.""

I kept my voice even, just telling him to drive safe.

He seemed to relax. ""You take care, too. Don't catch a cold.""

""Liam,"" I said suddenly, ""this year, for the holidays... can we tell my parents about us?""

He had always refused, saying the time wasn't right.

""Let's not,"" he said, his voice low. ""They're already pushing you to get married. Let's not add fuel to the fire.""

""Okay,"" I said with a small, hollow laugh, and hung up.

The fever hit me hard after being soaked in the rain. For the first time ever, I took a taxi to work. As I stared out the window, Liam's car sped past me.

My apartment was actually very close to his. But the direct route, Maple Creek Drive, had always been a traffic nightmare, a guaranteed thirty-minute jam. So I never expected him to give me a ride, and he was happy to maintain the professional distance.

It wasn't until today that I realized the road had been repaired for over six months. The drive now took ten minutes.

For half a year, he had driven past my front door every single day and never once offered me a ride.

And today, he was coming from the direction of Tina's apartment complex.

It wasn't on his way at all. It was a special trip.

At the office, I stuck a cooling patch to my forehead and buried myself in preparing handover documents. A familiar figure appeared at my desk.

Liam frowned. ""You're sick? Why didn't you say anything?""

I didn't look up. ""What's the point? It's not like you'd take care of me like a normal boyfriend.""

Noticing colleagues arriving, I lowered my voice. ""You should go. You hate being seen with me, remember?""

He was silent for a moment before turning and walking away.

The second stop was Ashville.

My connection with Liam had a chapter in Ashville, too.

I had just been made a permanent employee. I went with Mr. Quinn and Liam to Ashville to finalize a contract. The night before the signing, after we'd reviewed the final proposal, we went out for a late dinner.

Suddenly, a group of masked men rushed out of the darkness. Their target was clearly Liam, and they were vicious. Mr. Quinn started shouting and fumbling for his phone to call the police.

If something happened to Liam, tomorrow's contract was dead.

Without thinking, I grabbed a loose brick from the pavement and charged.

We both ended up taking a beating.

When I saw a knife swinging toward Liam's head, I threw myself in front of him, taking the blow on my arm. He pulled me down with him as we fell, and the last thing I heard before passing out was the wail of sirens.

When I woke up, he was the only one in the hospital room.

""Was it worth it?"" he asked, staring at me. ""Ready to die for me?""

""I couldn't just... watch them hurt you,"" I whispered. ""You helped me before. This time, I helped you.""

I looked down and realized he was holding my hand.

The gesture felt strangely familiar. I froze. ""Mr. Song...""

""Call me by my name,"" he said softly.

On the day I was discharged, the company was supposed to send a car, but he came to pick me up himself. He took me to the lake in Crestwood, his gaze as gentle as the rippling water.

""I've been thinking a lot,"" he said. ""The girl who took a knife for me... if she's willing to walk toward me, I'll cherish her forever.""

The setting sun stained the lake red. I reached out and hugged him. He leaned down and kissed my forehead.

Back then, he looked at my wounds with such heartache. Now, he just frowned at my fever patch.

After I finished the handover documents, a colleague nudged me to check the work group chat.

In the new project channel, Mr. Quinn had added Liam. He had posted only one message: The project is entering its final phase. Full responsibility will be transferred to Tina.

My colleagues shot discreet glances at me, waiting for a reaction. Everyone knew Liam disliked me, but this was a deliberate humiliation.

I simply typed, ""Received.""

It was for the best. It made the handover even easier.

I transferred all the materials to Tina, then submitted a request for sick leave. It was approved instantly.

I left my resignation letter on the desk, too.

5

The third stop: Haven Springs.

Haven Springs was the last place Liam and I had traveled to together. His promotion was about to be announced, and I was thrilled for him. We went to a famous hot springs resort there.

The owner said that if a couple posted a photo together on social media and got 30 'likes', he'd give them VIP tickets for the Ferris wheel next door. No waiting in line, straight to the top. Legend had it that if a couple kissed at the very top of the Ferris wheel, they would be happy forever and never part.

I wanted to post to a private group of friends, but Liam refused.

""The company forbids office romance, Anna. You know that.""

""I know, but I can set the post so colleagues won't see it.""

""Have you ever heard of the six degrees of separation theory? It's too risky.""

In the end, we bought regular tickets to the amusement park. But the line for the Ferris wheel was too long, and we never got on.

Seeing my disappointment, he comforted me. ""Anna, it's because I love you that I want to protect you, to protect us.""

""Will you help me guard our love?"" he asked.

I naively agreed. And so began five years of carrying the secret alone.

Compared to the countless heartaches of those five years, that fever was nothing.

After submitting my resignation, I went home, packed my bags, and waited for my late-night train.

Suddenly, the door opened. It was Liam. He slipped on the house slippers and walked in.

""Why is so much stuff missing?"" he asked, a bag of soup and porridge in his hand as he surveyed the room.

""Just doing some New Year's cleaning,"" I said, clearing my throat.

He set the bag on the coffee table, and as he unpacked it, he froze.

""Where are our photos?""

I used to have our Polaroid pictures scattered everywhere—on the coffee table, the dining table, the bookshelf.

I closed my eyes. ""Some colleagues came over the other day. I put them away.""

He helped me sit up and handed me chopsticks. I looked at the table full of food but had no appetite.

""Not hungry?"" He sat beside me, reaching to put an arm around me. ""Want some hot water then?""

I shifted away, and just then, his phone rang.

It was Tina, her voice frantic. ""Mr. Song, I can't find the signed acceptance form for the Tech Park project! What do I do?!""

He stood up. ""Hold on, I'm on my way.""

He looked back at me, his expression all business again. ""Is this how you handle a handover?""

He didn't even wait for my explanation before grabbing his coat and rushing out the door. Just like the countless times he had left me for work. Only this time, it made me feel even more ridiculous.

The folder and cabinet number for the acceptance form were clearly listed on the last page of the handover document. Tina had made the presentation for that project; she knew exactly where it was.

Sure enough, a little while later, a text from Liam came through.

Found it. Your notes were very clear.

It was followed by a money transfer for the exact amount of my missing bonus.

I declined it.

He sent back a frustrated emoji. Get some rest. I have a meeting.

Every Friday at this time, he had a video conference with the New York headquarters. He wouldn't look at his phone for three or four hours.

I sent him one last message.

Let's break up.

I blocked his number and then called my landlord to terminate the lease.

6

The fourth stop was Silver Creek, my transfer station. Two more stops and I'd be home.

But the train was delayed, by at least an hour. I wasn't in a hurry. I found a little café to kill time.

The company had a branch here, too. Liam and I used to come for meetings, always in separate cars with a team of people. No one ever suspected a thing.

I had slowly started to make a name for myself under Mr. Quinn. Because Liam was so demanding, everyone advised me to learn how to suck up to him.

So I did. I bought him a Yuanyang tea latte and handed it to him with a serious expression.

""Is this the Yuanyang?"" he asked, taking it.

""Yes,"" I smiled.

""Doesn't Mr. Song only drink coffee?"" Mr. Quinn chuckled. ""Changing tastes just for Silver Creek?""

Liam didn't say anything. He just traced the word ""Yuanyang"" on the cup with his finger and nodded at me. ""Thanks.""

I practically floated back to my seat, hiding my smile as I sipped my own. It was our secret, a hidden current of affection beneath a sea of professionalism.

That's probably why I froze when I saw him accept a Yuanyang tea latte from Tina's hands.

I had just sat down with my order when my phone exploded with notifications from Mr. Quinn.

You're quitting?! Is it because of the bonus? You're a senior employee, you need to be more magnanimous...

Mr. Song saw your letter. He ripped it up! He was furious!

Annoyed, I blocked him, too.

Then, my landlord called.

""Honey, your boyfriend came by the apartment about three or four hours ago. My daughter-in-law was there, that's how I knew. I just thought I should tell you.""

Liam must have seen my message after his meeting and found out I was quitting.

""He renewed the lease for you,"" she continued. ""Said you'd be back.""

""My daughter-in-law said he tore the place apart looking for something, then grabbed his car keys and stormed out. Looked like he was on the warpath. Honey, it's the holidays, you two shouldn't be fighting.""

I had to laugh. Fight? I didn't have the energy for that anymore.

My phone showed a notification: 99+ calls from blocked numbers.

I didn't check who it was.

I drank my tea, watched a movie, and when I figured it was about time, I stood up to head back to the platform.

Just then, the barista called out to a new customer. ""Sir, what can I get for you?""

""A Yuanyang tea latte.""

The familiar voice cut through the café's chatter. I looked up.

Liam was standing there, his face ashen, shoulders dusted with snow. He practically spat the words out.

7

""What's the matter, Mr. Song? Not too sweet for you?"" I shrugged and grabbed my suitcase to leave.

He snatched the suitcase with one hand and my arm with the other, dragging me out of the café.

Unfortunately, the holiday travel rush meant the waiting hall was a sea of people. There was nowhere private for him to unleash his fury.

He pulled me toward an exit. ""Let's talk outside!""

It was an exit-only door. I dug my heels in. ""We can talk right here!""

He settled for a less crowded corner, slamming my suitcase down. A vein pulsed in his forehead.

""Anna Yuan, what is the meaning of this?!""

""I'm going home for the holidays!"" I glanced at the ""Delayed"" sign on the departures screen.

""I went straight from your apartment to the station,"" he said, his eyes bloodshot. ""I called your name. Didn't you hear me?""

Still using that same boss-like tone.

""Nope,"" I said, shaking my head.

If the train hadn't been delayed, he might have actually caught me. Fate was a funny thing.

""I floored it the whole way here."" The snow on his shoulders had melted into a dark, damp patch. ""If this train hadn't been late, you were just going to disappear, weren't you?!""

Well, yeah. What else?

I sighed. ""I'm going home, Liam. I'm not dying.""

""You're angry because I misunderstood about the handover, right?"" He grabbed my hand.

Every single one of our fights, he always boiled it down to the one, single incident that set it off. He knew perfectly well it was just the tip of the iceberg, the last straw.

I pulled my hand away. ""Mr. Song, I've already resigned. I'll call you that one last time out of respect for our professional relationship. Please show some decency.""

""Resigned? Decency?"" He let out a cold laugh. ""I didn't approve your resignation, and I didn't agree to break up.""

""Seems like both of those are things I can decide on my own,"" I said, reaching for my suitcase.

""Do you want to see me in arbitration? Do you want to fail your next background check?"" he threatened from behind me.

""Do what you want."" I shook my head, unfazed. ""I'm not coming back to Kingston anyway.""

He blocked my path again, his eyes filled with rage. ""Are you serious?!""

I held up my hands. ""Perfectly serious. You like Tina. I'm setting you free. Shouldn't you thank me?""

He grabbed my arm again, pulling me closer. ""I don't like her!"" A flicker of something else crossed his face. ""Anna, are you jealous? Is this all because of the bonus? Is that why you're so angry?""

I struggled against his grip and gestured toward a nearby patrol officer. ""If you don't let go, I'm going to scream!""

Instead, he pulled me into a fierce hug. ""I'm holding my own girlfriend! What law am I breaking?""

He held me tight, just like he used to, his shoulder cradling my chin. ""It was my fault. I should have stood up for you.""

I tried to push him away but was hopelessly outmatched. Just as I opened my mouth to shout, the boarding announcement crackled over the speakers.

""Passengers for train G946, boarding has now begun...""

The crowd, which had given up hope, surged with renewed energy, pushing and shoving toward the gate. Someone carrying a huge gift box bumped into Liam, loosening his grip for a second. I seized the opportunity, slipping away and melting into the crowd heading for the gate.

He tried to follow, but I ducked into the most chaotic line. People immediately started yelling at him for cutting.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I finally reached the ticket scanner.

I reached into my pocket. My ID and phone were gone.

I turned around. Liam was standing at a distance, outside the line, a small, triumphant smile on his face.

I took a deep breath and marched back to him. ""What are you, eight years old?! Give them back!""

He strode toward the main exit. ""Come and get them.""

Okay, maybe seven. I ran after him.

He headed straight for the parking garage, his long legs covering the ground quickly. I had to jog to keep up.

""Give them back!"" I was frantic, hearing the final boarding call in the distance.

""You changed your lock screen. And your passcode."" He stood by his car, looking at my phone.

My old lock screen had been a picture of our silhouettes at an amusement park. It looked generic enough that he had ""graciously"" allowed me to use it. Now, it was a picture of my family's dog. The passcode was no longer his birthday, but the dog's.

""Get in."" He opened the passenger door. ""I'll drive you home.""

I held out my hand, my patience worn to a thread. ""Liam, are you seriously going to steal my property?!""

He pushed me into the passenger seat, leaning over me with one hand on the seatback while the other pulled the seatbelt across and clicked it into place.

He looked down at my furious face. ""Go ahead. Call the police. Sue me. We can spend the entire holiday season tangled up in this.""",1,1759689383.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

TLDR: 
Outdoorsy heart, geeky brain, animal lover. 🎮🖼️
Thoughtful, caring, and ready for someone loving, funny, and full of life.
Make me laugh, beat me at Halo (if you can), and let’s see where it goes.

The Long Version:
I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul.

What I’m Looking For
I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are always welcome here.

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, I’d love to hear from you.

I bought a season pass because I haven't been able to bike really for the past 5 years due to school and finally had an opportunity to really lean into the sport. I've been loving it and the growth that I've had in my sport has been tremendous and I'm at the point where I can take on black diamond trails and jumps. I usually go every two to three weeks and look forward to it every time.

Today I felt somewhat tired and burnt out. Today is closing day for the bike park which means that if I don't go today, I won't be able to ride there until next season. This was a difficult dilemma because if today wasn't closing day, I'd say screw it, relax at home guilt free, and go next weekend. I had a busy week, I'm getting over a cold, and I've gone so many times and have grown so much I feel like I shouldn't feel bad and should cut myself some slack. Especially since the drive is two hours one way/4 hours round trip, which takes a lot out of a person when combined with 4-6 hours straight of biking. So, after loading up my gear and getting my morning coffee, I sat in my car for about 20 minutes and decided that I wasn't feeling it and I'd go home, relax, and be happy I had a great season. Plus, if I still wanted to bike more, Snow Valley, another bike park, is open weekends for the rest of October and their trails would feel refreshing after hitting the same ones I have been hitting all summer.

However, after unloading my gear and starting to relax at home, guilt began to set in. I felt like a quitter who made the wrong decision and that I would regret this. It's like the exhaustion, desire to relax, and my positive feelings about the season disappeared. My brain started filling my head with pictures of the happy trail riding I missed out on today, as if to make me feel bad. It's really bothering me and I don't know how to manage it. I especially feel bad because I feel like being lazy is loser shit, and that I need to keep pushing myself to touch grass and grow in my hobby. I feel like anyone who'd affirm my need to rest or take a break is just sitting on their ass scrolling TikTok all day locked in a dopaminergic hugbox of sloth who'd give themself any excuse to continue rotting on their couch. Therefore, no matter what, I quit, what anyone else says is stupid, and I fucked up. Bad. (Sorry if this last part is really mean, I know its irrationally angry and bullying; I just want to communicate what goes through my stream of thought to myself).

So, with this all in mind, I need some help reflecting on this situation. How do I defeat the guilt when I decide I need to rest? How do I know whether I truly need the rest or it's just the ""bleh""s and I should push through them? How do I stop doing this ""grass is always greener"" shit when I make a decision and stop torturing myself?

1nyvva4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nyvva4/my_exfriend_cheated_on_her_husband_and_now_shes/,My ex-friend cheated on her husband and now she’s mad at me.,"A few months ago this couple I used to be good friends with caught their partner having an extremely inappropriate and sexual-toned emotional affair after less than 2 years of marriage. We hadn’t spoken for some time due to disagreements and had cut them off. Because of this situation, I was involved and my husband and I sided with the obvious victim in this scenario. A while later I reached out to the person who cheated and asked them if they wanted to meet up or chat, genuinely wanting to know if they were ok because we were friends for so long, I felt the need to reach out and maybe even meet for coffee? Even just for the sake of being able to hear their side of the story, regardless if we hadn’t spoken for some time and the last time we spoke, it ended on a rough note. And I was met with complete animosity and told to stop contacting them. In a way hinting that the person who got cheated on, was the problem in their relationship and that they were in fact the victim. Am I missing something here? 

I am omitting quite a bit of the story since I know they are very active on Reddit and would prefer for them to not see this. 

I also know that it goes deeper than this, a marriage was broken and they are definitely hurt and wounded by all of this, and maybe I’m making it about myself for even feeing the need to reach out to them, but I just wanted to know if they’re ok, they are living back at home and I know their home life was always very tumultuous. Anyway…AITAH?

Edit: of course I’ll respect their request to not reach out, I’m not crazy. I guess my question is AITAH for reaching out. ",1,1759688667.0,AITAH,25,1.0,False

*Context: adult-diagnosed (a couple of months ago) ASD male from Ukraine*

Today, it was the largest drone and missile attack on my city during the entire war. Largest so far.

At 3:50 AM, the air alarm sirens woke me up, and I was drinking decaf coffee at my computer, listening to the drone sounds and explosions.

At 4:45, I went to a bomb shelter, since the missiles were approaching. The bomb shelter (3 large underground rooms) was packed with hundreds of people and pets. It was cold and noisy, and no place to sit, so I decided to stay in the corner away from the mass of people.

I was using my active noise-cancelling headphones listening to the audiobook, but still, the sound of large explosions was constantly heard, and the shockwave was *physically* felt, despite being underground.

Later, I've found a place to sit and try to close my eyes and focus on audiobooks. I've felt caught between two rocks large, noisy crowd in the shelter and a missile attack above the ground. It was a very unpleasant feeling.

Around 8 am, the missiles were gone, and only drones were left flying around the city, so I decided to go up and return to the apartment. It was cold and heavily raining, the city skies were gray and also full of smoke after the fire, and I walked, hearing the constant shooting at the drones.

My mother wrote me on messenger that the missiles hit near their house, and the window glass was out because of the shockwave. I simply didn't know how to respond to that. Later during the day, I managed to talk on the phone with her.

Previously, I've experienced panic attacks during the large missile strikes; today, I feel **exhausted** and **empty**. Is it some kind of shutdown?

1nyvs61,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcyclegear/comments/1nyvs61/new_rider_gear_check_cfmoto_700mt_commuting/,New Rider Gear Check: CFMoto 700MT Commuting & Touring Kit Advice,"Hi everyone! I'm prepping to buy my first bike, a **CFMoto 700MT ('25 model)**. I'm planning to use it for daily commuting (about 12km / 7.5 miles round trip) and relaxed weekend touring (50-250km / 30-150 miles per ride).

My riding philosophy is simple: **Full Gear, Every Ride**—even the shortest 500m trip to the store.

I already own:

* **Helmet:** [Scorpion EXO 1400 EVO Air Solid](https://www.motoemotion.ro/casti-moto-integrale/casca-integrala-sport-touring-scorpion-exo-1400-evo-air-solid.html)(Great sport-touring lid!)
* **Gloves:** [Alpinestars Mustang V2 Leather Gloves](https://www.motoemotion.ro/manusi-moto-de-piele/manusi-de-piele-alpinestars-mustang-v2.html)

I plan to buy everything new **in person** and try it on, as fit is everything.



# I need advice on completing my kit:

# 1. Jacket: Textile vs. Leather?

Given my mix of daily commuting (which involves rain/temperature shifts) and relaxed touring on the upright 700MT, which material makes more sense?

* **Textile:** Better for versatility, weatherproofing (removable liners), and ventilation.
* **Leather:** Superior abrasion protection but less adaptable to wet/hot weather.

What specific features should I look for in a textile touring jacket (e.g., laminated vs. drop liners, ventilation schemes)?

# 2. Pants: Moto Jeans & Protection

I'm leaning towards **Moto Jeans** for comfort and casual looks during the commute and coffee stops.

* What are the crucial protection features? Should I look for **full lining** or are jeans with spot protection (knees/hips) acceptable?
* Should I definitely aim for **CE Level 2** knee and hip protection inserts?

# 3. Essential Protection Upgrades

I'm budgeting for high-quality armor. Besides shoulders and elbows, what's the consensus on **Back Protectors**?

* Is an aftermarket **CE Level 2 insert** a *must-have* upgrade over the standard foam pad that comes with most jackets?

# 4. Boots: Short/Urban vs. Touring?

This is where I'm most unsure. **Are dedicated moto boots essential?** (I assume yes, for ankle/crush protection).

* I plan to make stops on my longer tours (e.g., stop for coffee, walk 1-2 km around the area). **How uncomfortable are proper touring/urban moto boots for walking?** Should I look for a short/urban style boot for maximum walking comfort while maintaining ankle protection?

Any and all recommendations based on your experience would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",3,1759688468.0,motorcyclegear,4,1.0,False

1nyvqod,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyvqod,Looks can be deceiving 😅,"The last time I followed a recipe from TikTok it turned out amazing, this time I thought: well, last time worked out so well, it must do this time as well right? WRONG!

It was a video of a Dutch woman using cups to measure (in the Netherlands we usually weigh most ingredients), which was a change for me. Definitely open to try though! But in the video she did things completely different, used vanilla coffee sirup (1/3 cup!!) to flavour the cream cheese topping. The recipe said to use half a tsp of vanilla extract. She even said she wasn’t using too much powder sugar because she doesn’t like it too sweet 👀 

I decided to power through though, following along as far as I could and they looked good when I got them out the oven. But when I tucked in, half of the thing was still raw. Put them back in with the topping and they did bake through after another 25 minutes at a higher temperature. 

Just annoyed at people sharing recipes in text, while doing something completely different on screen and then showing an end product that doesn’t match the recipe. 

Rant over, just wanted to vent to people who will probably understand me and my annoyance best lol

I’m a graphic designer with over seven years of experience, Despite my extensive experience in design, I haven’t been able to get even a single client on freelancing platforms like Upwork or Fiverr. Clients tend not to trust freelancers who don’t have any reviews.

For years, I’ve been trying to land my first client just to get some ratings, but without success — even when I offer my services for extremely low prices. Because of that, I’ve had to focus on design contests instead, as it’s the only way I can truly showcase my skills. In most of the contests I’ve joined, I’ve managed to win or outperform designers labeled as *Top Level* or *Mid Level*.

However, the contest system is exhausting and stressful, I work hard without any guarantee of winning or getting paid.

I believe I can dial in coffee but currently I see myself dosing 20g in my 49mm.

Is this something you do?

5'7""
Non smoker.
Asperger's
Depersonalization (since I was 13, unrelated to post). 
Symptoms started late 2021 (after I got omicron).
Noticed similar headaches a year prior when taking CBD oil (not all the time).
Headaches, sinus pressure, brain fog, arrhythmia, frequent urination.



Extreme headaches and brain fog (debilitating). Tried everything to fix and nothing helped, but one day I took an Omeprezone to rule out silent reflux (just experimenting) and had my symptoms multiply. What I was feeling wasn't on the box, so I read the entire pamphlet and figured out it depletes magnesium in 3 weeks or use - but I had symptoms of magnesium depletion after a few hours.

Went to an ENT and found nothing wrong as well as my doctor, who wasn't particularly useful. Main symptoms are pressure near frontal sinuses and brain fog, as well as frequent urination, and some arrhythmia. (I don't have frontal sinuses btw).

Taking magnesium (started immediately after the acid reflux med) every day (about 300mg) keeps me from getting headaches and takes away the other symptoms, and I'm about 80 percent better. Any stress makes the headaches start again though. Any amount of vitamin D (supplement, even in dairy), or CBD oil makes my body bring back all the symptoms by the next day, and it will be very painful. Things like coffee (caffeine), chocolate, and carbonated drinks I can do but they will cause the symptoms to come back if I have too many. Cod liver oil, and other high vitamin d foods seem to have the same result (headaches).

If anyone has any ideas that would be cool. Otherwise knowing what kind of doctor to go see would be nice. PCP docs haven't been much help.  I've tried to take more magnesium but it doesn't seem to make me feel better.  

Misc beyond here.

I'm also very susceptible to drug reactions.  We seem to have a high pain tolerance. I had my foot ran over by a 4000 lb hard wheeled machine and there was no pain (broken bone).  Which doesn't seem unusual (my mother was sent back to work after shattering her wrist because there was no pain).  Also since I was little I've had poor fitness ability. But taking magnesium cured my inability to breathe while exercising.  I've been steadily raising my fitness level for probably the first time in my life, but if I stop taking the magnesium I'm back to pain within a week.

Note : My sister was actually having a panic attack due to work and I told her she wasn't being rational. Along with finger/foot numbness.  I suggested magnesium and she's turned into a carefree very present person. 😂. They have the same ""exercise asthma"" I do, along with childhood asthma. But it seems cured lately due to the magnesium.",1,1759688244.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1nyvnsw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyvnsw,"In Port Today: Meet Royal Caribbean's ""Liberty of the Seas""","Three ships in port today. I'm currently sitting in Radial Coffee on Commercial Street - there's nobody here except me, a handful of customers, and the baristas. Great coffeeshop though.

*Liberty of the Seas* is a[ Royal Caribbean](https://foe.org/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean-intl/) ship. Royal Caribbean has had several environmental violations. The most [recent major one](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-473685-penalty-royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-alleged-rcra-violations) (2024) resulted in a fine of $473,685 in 2024 for failing to notify EPA of alleged waste handling and management activities.

*Liberty* has a [""hybrid"" scrubber](https://liqtech.com/systems/marine-scrubber/marine-scrubber-water-treatment-system/open-loop-vs-closed-loop-scrubbers/) installed. It can be used in two modes, ""open"" or ""closed."" 

* If ""open,"" it pumps huge quantities of live sea water through the air exhaust to to extract some particulates and pollution, and then dumps that polluted water (the industry term for this is ""sludge"") overboard, right into Casco Bay. Scrubber sludge is known to damage ecosystems and cause ocean acidification.
* If ""closed,"" it circulates pH-adjusted sea water in a closed system to do the same thing, then disposes of that polluted water and/or solids somewhere else, ideally an on-shore waste handling facility.

*Scrubbers don't make ships fundamentally cleaner - they just move the pollution around.* To make ships cleaner they really should use cleaner fuel. A ship that uses a cleaner distillate fuel like Marine Gas Oil (MGO), instead of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), can emit 70% less [particulate matter](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm) \- that’s the insidious stuff that gets into our lungs and blood stream. \[[ICCT](https://theicct.org/publication/air-emissions-and-water-pollution-discharges-from-ships-with-scrubbers/)\] 

There are currently no regulations in Portland about scrubbers. [Portland Cruise Control](https://portlandcruisecontrolmaine.org/) has asked the port about whether ships with hybrid scrubbers have them open or closed or off while docked, and not received an answer. *(Some ships have only an open-loop scrubber, other ships don't have scrubbers at all, and unlike California, Washington and many parts of Europe, Maine does not have regulations around any of this.)*

The City Council is going to discuss scrubbers and possible regulations at their November 12 Sustainability & Transportation Committee meeting. If you'd like to be kept in the loop, I invite you to join Portland Cruise Control: [https://portlandcruisecontrolmaine.org/](https://portlandcruisecontrolmaine.org/)

However every few minutes this dumb warning comes on and intrupts my music. I looked on line and I got two conflicting awnsers. One said its due to drifting out of the lane and the other says its due to not keeping your eyes on the road.

When we were driving yesterday it never showed up and my co-worker is not drifting or driving erratically. I realized its due to his sunglasses, the system for somereason thinks because his eyes are not visible he isnt looking at the road. 

I am somone with light sensitivity and my glasses have transition lenses. On especially sunny days I wear darker shades.

It seems impossible to disable this feature, and after removing his shades the reminder has not come on once.

This has me honestly incredibly disappointed, as somone who always wears shades while driving during the day, this is defenetly a deal breaker for me. Furthermore I dont drink coffee and I find the reminder extranet confusion and passive aggressive. I already deal with passive aggressive asshole daily the thought of my car badgering me for wearing sunglasses pmo so much. Also why would hyundai create a warning that makes no logical sense and doesnt explain what the issue is. Telling me to drink coffee is pointless since caffeine doesnt even wake you up it just prevents drowsiness but if youre already tired it doesnt help. And why did I have to spend 10 minutes trying to figure this out. 

Do all newer hyundais do this? Specifically the Palisade and Tuscon? And did they add the ability to disable this in the newer (25,26) model years? Is there some kind of DIY I could use to fool the system?",1,1759688172.0,HyundaiSantaFe,7,0.56,False
