Certain weekend could consist of linking up with friends for adventures or nights out in and out-of-town; Others could be dedicated to strategizing cool business ideas or grinding through our to-do lists on adderall.

1mb5wyj,https://i.redd.it/jeqcytrycjff1.jpeg,"Basically same recipe, different leavening results??","Hello! I’ve recently made this recipe for oat cakes that I can make for breakfast or as a guilt-free dessert, but I’ve just noticed something strange: the chocolate ones are slightly tougher, they rise unevenly, and they sink slightly after cooling!! Is this because of the added acidity from the dutched cocoa and instant coffee powder? Do I need to reduce the amount of baking powder used for the chocolate ones?? Do I need to add more milk for the chocolate variety??? The recipe’s as follows:

Dry ingredients:
50g oats, blended until fine
1 scoop (31g) vanilla ice cream protein powder
1 tbsp monkfruit
1 tsp chia seeds
3/4th tsp clabber girl baking powder
Pinch of salt

Wet ingredients:
1/4th cup fage total 0% Greek yogurt
150ml fairlife fat free milk

(for vanilla cakes)
1 tsp vanilla extract

(for chocolate cakes)
2 tbsp Hershey’s special dark cocoa
1 tsp instant coffee powder

Combine all dry ingredients EXCEPT for baking powder. Heat milk until it begins to scald, then pour into dry mixture and whisk to combine. If making chocolate cakes, stir instant coffee into the hot milk ensure it dissolves fully prior to combining. If making vanilla cakes, add vanilla extract to the batter. Mix in Greek yogurt and allow the batter to sit in the fridge for about an hour for the hot milk to fully hydrate the oats and chia/thicken the batter. Right before baking, stir in baking powder then split batter into two 14 oz buttered ramekins and bake at 300 for 40 minutes.",1,1753673933.0,Baking,1,1.0,False

I’m looking for folks that are interested in activities that don’t involve purchases or clubbing and preferably get the body or mind moving. I would love to find a walking/hiking/paddle boarding/book club buddy/group or really any activities that aren’t media based and get the body moving. I bounce between Rocklin, Folsom and Sacramento (city college area) I’ve been working on quitting my vices one at a time to improve my mental and physical health and while I have no qualms about hanging with people that aren’t sober or enjoy social media I would just like to find something that doesn’t rely on those things.

I’m very much a novice when it comes to exercise but I’m staying consistent with it and would enjoy a workout buddy too. I’ve enlisted some existing friends and they just aren’t consistent (no shade, just how things have been going) and I’d love to expand my circle to more folks that are taking steps to be kind to their future selves. I quit drinking, smoking, nicotine, and cut back on coffee and social media nearly completely so I just don’t tend to participate in the same social activities that I used to and many of my friends just aren’t there yet.

I’d love any recommendations or DMs from anyone interested in meeting for an outdoor walk maybe 1-3 miles.

Outdoors: camping, <5mi hikes, walking, paddle boarding
Roadtrips
Older cars (especially pre 2000s imports)

I’ve bleached over pure henna plenty of times without issue and used henna over bleached hair without issue.

Hey there, I haven’t seen anything on this so I thought I’d drop it here.
I’ve been using henna and indigo on my hair for about 13 years starting with Lush’s henna before they reformulated which pushed me into the world of mixing my own concoctions which I like much better and are a lot less messy. 
That being said, I recently tried indigo after my henna when usually I process my henna for 4 hours and then process my indigo for 20 minutes both for good dye release as per their packaging instructions (both are pure henna and pure indigo, no add ins) and then mix them together before application. My hair got much darker than I anticipated. Initially I used oil to lift as much of the indigo as I could and used a clarifying shampoo and did this for around 2 weeks. After a certain point the water did nothing but run clear. 

This is where color remover comes in. I’ve had success with color oops in the past over henna but it pulls only a little out compared to the Matrix one. I used distilled water instead of the 20 vol developer. It still smelled like straight bleach and looked like really runny bleach. When on the head it smells like an over chlorinated pool. It did lighten well. I left it on for 15 minutes the first time because I ended up with some on my scalp (it’s for off scalp application) and it began to get very warm so I washed it out. It felt gritty and gross so I used conditioner to get it out and it worked well. I ended up with bleached roots in one spot but other wise the color of my hair had lifted. I did a second round the same day and I’m giving my hair a break for a day or two before round 3. With the amount of indigo I had in I was fully expecting my hair to go bright green like it had when I had bleached it in the past (8 years ago) given this stuff smelled so much like bleach. I have no green tint to my hair and the color remover washed out bright almost neon blue the first round which shocked me and a little less bright blue the second time. My hair still feels healthy and soft, there wasn’t any dye of chemicals (including removers) used on my hair previous to this so it was just layers of henna and indigo on undamaged hair. 

Here’s my typical henna mix:

45% henna powder (let dye release for 2-4 hours)
35% cassia powder (added directly to henna)
20% indigo (let dye release for 20 mins)

I also add a small spoon full of these:
- Amla powder
- Aloe powder
- Fenugreek powder
- Amla oil
- Melted raw cocoa butter

Liquid:

- Warm water (usually)
- Hibiscus tea (if I want more of a red tinge)
- Instant coffee or freshly brewed strong coffee (if I’m going for a more brown tinge)


I mix everything into the henna in a big bowl and then use gloves to apply it to my head and wrap it with cling wrap and then a towel to keep it warm. I leave it on for 2-3 hours typically and I’m happy with the results. I rinse it out completely and shampoo on day 4 after full oxidation.

I also used the fruity cereal as my test for using half & half instead of heavy whipping cream. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! The consistency was so much better and smoother and no more weird oily layer from the cream. Thanks to all that suggested that on so many posts. It's a definite game changer for me.

For the coffee ice cream, I made a standard base and used coffee concentrate for the flavor. Came out great, zero complaints. Also used half & half for this one and it had such a smooth consistency.

The Mountain Dew ice cream is a work in progress. The flavor is...off. I used a soda stream syrup and I definitely used too much. Gotta find the right balance.",1,1753673314.0,ninjacreami,1,1.0,False
1mb5pil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mb5pil/my_mother_is_going_through_the_change_and_pushing/,My Mother is going through the change and pushing me away. How did you handle?,"I’m in my early 30s and my mom is 55 and going through menopause for almost 3 years. She makes everything about her and she’s making me feel like I’m a bad daughter. I don’t know what to do. 

It only seems to be getting worse as time passes and I’m desperate. 

Context (long):
I am an only child and we are very close but spending time together is very difficult now. 
I moved out years ago for school and stayed living in a big city in a completely different state and part of the country than my parents. I miss them and do try to visit multiple times a year or have them visit (I pay) and we talk on the phone every day- kind of a cultural thing too, we’re close. 
Ever since my mom started menopause, she’s become very emotional about everything. She gets very upset, butthurt and then cries but never admits fault or apologizes and it takes her a while to snap out of it. While I was planning my wedding, she constantly was upset I wasn’t getting married where they live and during my wedding day, she acted extremely selfish: she wanted my bridesmaids to basically lay down a red carpet for her and everyone to acknowledge as the mother of the bride and for everyone to want to talk to her… she said my bridesmaids didn’t really talk to her so she left -she left the getting ready suite after the stylists got her makeup and hair done- she was not there for me and kept getting irrationally upset if people were not focused on her or if I wasn’t answering her every wish. She left the suite upset and almost made me cry. She wouldn’t tell me why either. 

They came to visit months later and she kept making it like she didn’t want to bother us at our home… one day they asked for the heat to be turned on because they were cold and I said let’s see how it goes tonight because the house temperature is 72… well, the next morning she said they were going to pack up and go back home because they couldn’t sleep and they didn’t want to disturb me. I had to beg them to stay and I changed the temperature. 

Now I went to visit them recently and my mother wanted to join me in every activity which I let her, but then still got upset I went for coffee with a friend once while visiting and because I had to work one night and we ate dinner at home instead of out. She wouldn’t let it go. She kept throwing it in my face. I told her me and my husband were going on vacation in a month and she and my dad didn’t ask much about it and she honestly seemed upset. She has asked for us to go on a vacation before and it hasn’t come to fruition, because I don’t get much vacation and I just got married. 
She comes off like: you don’t want to spend time with us (even if I’m with her at her home) because I’m working for half the day; you don’t want to travel with us (I’d have to pay for her and my dad even if partial that would be the expectation so it hasn’t been possible); and you make a lot of money but can’t do XYZ things I want… like she tells me I need to buy a car, or this and that furniture… and while me and my husband are very well off, we are very cautious about saving as we want to start a family and I don’t want to work my very awfully demanding job forever…. 

Sometimes she will even be annoyed if I don’t call her and she’s very short with me when I do after the fact. 

My mom blames her menopause for her emotional and rage moments. But I’m more concerned she seems to not like me, or gets upset and won’t tell me why. She feels I don’t care about her or love her (she constantly asks) and I feel guilty and like a bad daughter… but she never apologizes. My dad is constantly on her side because if he agrees with me she says we are siding against her and we hate her and she get so moody upset. 

I don’t know what to do. I think this is normal menopause behavior, but from your experience is it going to get worse? And does she hate me or resent me or thinks I’m failing her? How can I handle this so we can still be close? 
Thank you!

1mb5p98,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1mb5p98/fun_to_imagine/,Fun to Imagine.,"Few years ago fresh out of High School, I got a job at a straw factory. Not an easy job, didn't help being third shift but hey it was good money for the time. Anyway at one point there was this guy there. He was a kind guy, solid worker too. 

I remember once he nervously and aqwardly gave me a complement.

Him: ""You smell nice""
Me: ""Oh... Um... Thank you""

And that was it. Fast forward a bit the other coworkers said he was a Gay guy, and some gave him grief for it. He ended up quitting later on, don't know if it was because of that or something else, but he left.

I don't know if this is normal, but as time has moved on. And I'm discovering more about myself, I still sometimes think back to that guy. ""Dang, he was really sweet. I wish I could have got him a coffee."" 

To be honest... I think I'm telling this story because I'm coming to terms that I'm gay. (Or at the VERY least, not strictly straight.) And I'm just trying to get used to that reality. 

Will I ever pursue that reality, and find another man who I can love, cherish, and Marry. Knowing my people pleasing personality, probably not if I'm honest with myself. I'll probably remain single to be frank. 

 I love my family dearly, and they would be devastated and excommunicate me if they ever thought I was gay. That would devastate me as well. Doesn't help that where I live gay men are unicorns, they are just really rare. 

A part of me feels disgusted for even entertaining these feelings. ""I shouldn't feel this way, this is wrong, your shameful for feeling this way.""

But hey, I can at least think back to that cute guy who complemented me. And imagine buying him a coffee. 

It's fun to imagine, at least.",1,1753673280.0,GayMen,0,1.0,False

Still, that -4.5 spread feels like the line was drawn by a fan who’s seen Calgary’s offense stall more times than they’d admit.

**Ottawa**, at **+4.5 spreads (1.95)** and a **moneyline of +2.8 (implied 35.7% win probability)**, are the classic ""sleeping giant"" — or maybe just a giant who’s really good at napping. Their +4.5 line gives them a fighting chance, though their 35.7% implied odds suggest the books aren’t betting on a miracle.

1mb5oya,https://i.redd.it/i4kaqwyxajff1.jpeg,Split road confusion,"So today I passed the one-off driver test in Gungahlin. I’ve been a full license holder from the Philippines since 2014. I had to retake lessons since in Manila, we drive on the other side of the road. I did the basic driving lessons, then also did a mock test with a different driving school. As a requirement, I also completed the pre-learner licence course as well as the DKT.

This intersection always confused me, so I asked two different instructors, as well as some of my coworkers, to clarify. In my test, the exact scenario happened.

I’m the blue car. According to the lessons I took, when I’m behind the stop line on a split road, I should treat it like a normal intersection and give way to the yellow car. So I did. Then the assessor said, “You have right of way.” I asked him, “Shouldn’t I give way to him since he’s going straight?” He said, “That’s a roundabout,” and in my head I thought, “No, that’s not a roundabout. It has stop signs and all.” But he kept insisting. I just didn’t comment further because I was so anxious he was going to fail me. After that intersection, he closed his ipad and kept quiet the whole time. In the end, he said he was going to be lenient and gave me a passing mark.

The last few weeks have been brutal deadlines, pressure, stress. I’m behind in almost everything. My history essays are sprawling and aimless. My artwork looks lazy and uninspired. I’ve been putting in hours but getting nowhere.

And I haven’t been sleeping.

Not because of nightmares. Just… time. There’s never enough of it. I know that sounds like a cliché “I’m a student, I don’t sleep” but it’s true. My schedule’s a mess. I’ll spend an hour trying to start a painting, then spiral into panic because I haven’t done the reading for a lecture I forgot I even had. But this week, somehow, I managed to submit everything.

Not well. Not proudly. But done. For the first time in ages, I could finally breathe. No more all-nighters. No more caffeine-fueled essay sessions or crying over unblended acrylics at 3AM. So I slept.

And then I dreamt something… wrong.

It wasn’t just unsettling. It meant something. It felt like a message. Or a warning.

I was in a wheat feild. It was overgrown and dry, flowing one with the wind. The clouds hung high above me pale, loose, not threatening rain. The strangest thing was the sun: it was both rising and setting at once, dancing between golden and pink light like the sky couldn't make up its mind.

There was nothing on the horizon. Not a tree. Not a distant barn or faraway city tower. Just wheat. Endless painted waves of dry gold rolling over hills and hills of fertile land. And I,  I was the first thing to ever touch it.

The stalks brushed against my legs. They felt sharp at first. But over time, they softened. I left a long trail behind me as I wandered, the pods hissing gently with every step.

I walked for what felt like hours. The only sound was a shallow melody from a type of bug crickets, maybe. Or something else that sings.

Then I saw it.

A blur. Dark. Human-shaped. Far in the distance.

I ran to it like a moth chasing fire. I don’t know why. Something about it pulled me in. But then I tripped and when I got back up. it was gone. I called out. Nothing answered, just a breeze passing through the place where he had stood. Still, I walked on. I crested the hill where the figure had been, and that’s when the land shifted.

The wheat was gone. All of it. In its place, a cold, barren field. Dead grass and pale dirt. The only thing in sight now was a building a castle. The young golden pink sky now grown, red and dark blue 

It rose in front of me like a monument to madness. Its towers leaned on one another. Its bridges led to nothing. The structure looked ancient, impossible. It wanted to be seen. It was now called to me.

I turned back, just once, and saw that the trail I had left in the wheat was gone. The land had healed. The stalks stood tall again, like I’d never touched them. Like I was never there

I went toward the castle.

The doors were impossibly tall. They didn’t budge at first. I pushed with all my strength, and eventually, they gave just enough for me to slip through.

The inside was dark and choking with dust. Fire lit the walls. Sunlight bled through stained glass the color of rich gold. The air tasted old.

A hallway stretched out before me, lined with huge paintings, each one covered by a sheet. One was only half-covered I looked beneath the cloth.

A knight. Full silver armor. Every inch of it carved with strange, violent incantations runes that looked hammered in, not engraved. Old, evil symbols I didn’t recognize. I couldn’t tell if the armor was meant to repel or welcome darkness.

I didn’t dare lift the cloth to see who or what wore it. At the end of the hall was another set of doors. These opened easier.

Inside: a vast, candlelit dining room. The ceiling stretched upward forever. A chandelier dangled over a table that could seat eighty. Forty chairs on each side. Portraits hung from every wall kings, queens, kingdoms and the lay of the land. All of them staring down with petrified strokes of paint.

And at the far end, before a massive stone fireplace, there was a throne.

Slumped in it was the thing I had seen in the field.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t anything.

Its flesh looked sewn together, stretched like old leather or poorly stitched textiles. Its jaw was long. almost animalistic but just plain wrong. Too many teeth. No nose, just a hole. No eyes either Just skin-wrapped sockets that never ended, infinity deep.

And misplaced horns twisted like deer antlers, black and overgrown. Its arm, long and bony, reached toward something in front of it a old, silver, crown with sharp peaks almost like it was forged out of daggers 

Its fingers were skeletal and ended in talons. The arm was wrapped in armor like the knight’s, but cracked and darkened. Similar but warped into a different time.

The creature wore a thick, black cape. The collar was fur, mismatched  prey and predator, hunter and hunted.

It was lifeless.

Hunched.

Dead.

I don’t know why I walked closer. I dont know why I reached out and Touched that crown.

Becacuse That’s when its hand twitched.

I fell backward, scrambling away. Its arm twitched again sharper this time, jerking like a broken puppet. Then it leaned forward, using the table for support.

A sharp crack echoed as its other arm landed with weight. Then, like something rising from a grave, it started to stand.

Its joints popped. Snapped. Every vertebra in its back cracked like breaking branches. Eight feet tall, maybe more with the horns.

I backed away. It was still waking up, if you can call that thing waking.

Its neck bent up, far too slowly. Its jaw opened, wide and yawning. From its throat came a gasping noise that became a growl.
And then unmistakably the word “Who” it sounded angry like a pharo raising to meet a tomb raider

Its eyeless head faced me now. Somehow, it saw me.

It took a step. Dust poured off its robes like falling ash, it was heavy and looked like a toddler taking its first steps but its second step looked sturdier and the third was muscle memory 

I turned. The door wouldn’t open. I slammed into it, again and again. The steps behind me were slow but growing faster. the door burst open. I fell through and landed on my stomach 

I don’t remember crawling. I just remember being on my feet, running through the castle entrance.

The creature didn’t follow. Not fully.

Back in the feilds I turned to look once I was far enough.

He was standing there. Looking at me like an aristocrat. Watching and studying.

For the first time, those eyeless sockets burned. A pair of yellow lights stared through the dusk. Then slowly… he put on the crown and closed the door.

I collapsed in the wheat.

I became part of the land again.

And then I woke up.

I gasped back to life and sat up in bed, covered in a cold sweat. It was still dark out I’d woken up before even my earliest alarm. There was no way I was going back to sleep. Not with that thing still fresh in my mind.

But it wasn’t fear keeping me up. It was infatuation.

I reached for one of my old sketchpads, thumbed through the blank pages, and started drawing.

I didn’t have a name for it yet, but later I started calling him the King.

The kettle boiled and I poured myself a coffee. Three pages of sketches the impossible castle, his face (or what I think was a face), the crown, the painting in the hallway. None of it was my best work, but something about it felt alive. There was potential.

My first class that day was my art workshop. Nothing special just standard uni stuff. But as I packed up, my professor came over to give me some pointers on the mess I’d been working on.
My sketchbook was poking out of my bag. She saw it, casually asked if I’d drawn anything new.

Proud of the chicken scratches I’d made that morning, I flipped to the King’s horrid visiage.

She stared for a moment. Then she gasped not in horror, but excitement.
Within minutes, we were talking about scrapping my current piece and starting a new final project, built around what she called “this surge of inspiration.”

That was it. The King’s portrait was now my new final piece.

And for the first time in weeks maybe months  I felt good. Like I had something real to work toward. Like I’d earned that dream.

But I didn’t know then what I know now.
That it wasn’t just a dream. That he wasn’t just some nightmare.

That he was something older. Something hungrier. Something primordial.

I’ll have to continue this later. I’ve got a lecture in ten minutes and I really can’t afford to fall further behind.",1,1753673111.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False

1mb5lxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mb5lxw/hate_love/,Hate & Love,"**""We are not alone, yet we feel like we are of ourselves, and that scares both the mind and soul of ourselves. Yet we feel so lost in this world. Especially when you're different from everyone else.""**



**""I'm just me.""** This mantra, a testament to my resilience, echoed in my mind. Despite the family rejection and the societal stigma of my autism spectrum disorder, I persevered, refusing to be defined by their dismissive attitudes and the label of 'dysfunctional disorder'.



With the aid of a government assistance program, I secured a monthly stipend of $600. This financial support was a stepping stone to my independence, allowing me to carve out a life of my own in Oregon, a place I had longed to explore. I used the funds to secure a living space and purchased a car, which required some repairs. The journey from Oregon to that particular place was daunting. Yet, I was resolute in my determination to live life on my own terms, free from the constraints of others' expectations.



My journey with autism began with a diagnosis at a young age. I came to understand that my condition, autism spectrum disorder, simply meant that I uniquely perceive the world. I've not only accepted but also embraced this uniqueness, finding strength in my differences.



I had what they called a higher-function disorder of autism, which meant I was able to socialize with people and talk to them. However, I still faced challenges in understanding and navigating the social and emotional complexities of life.



After my family heard about my diagnosis, their treatment of me changed. As the years went by and I aged while living with them, they became more emotional with me, showing anger and frustration more than usual. Whenever I felt sad or emotional, they would yell or even scream at me. People around me, and those I knew, thought this was normal behavior for my family, and that made me furious. Their reaction to my diagnosis was a constant source of emotional turmoil for me.



Having had enough of their nonsense and hatred towards me, I yelled back. The pain and anger felt like the explosion of a nuclear blast that destroyed everything, but they didn't care and didn't seem to be affected by my anger. So they sent me to a detention center, not caring about my side of the story. I stayed there for nine days, and when they let me out, I started to learn something that most people with the same disorder I have didn't follow up on.



**""There's no reason to be around people, and they hate just as much as you hate them.""** This quote, a reflection of my growing disillusionment with societal norms and expectations, encapsulates the emotional journey I was on at that time.



Leaving my family was a courageous decision, a step towards a life where I didn't have to tolerate others' negativity. It was a declaration of my independence, a choice to live my life on my own terms, free from the pain and anger that had plagued me for so long.



Despite the fear, I was resolute in my determination to live my own life. I knew it was time to take the necessary steps toward independence, to carve out a life that was truly my own.



I was able to prepare the world if it came, and all I ever wanted was just to live in peace, not in anger.



With a newfound determination, I returned home, not seeking their approval but ready to pack and transform my life on my own terms. I was prepared to take control of my destiny, and that's precisely what I did.



Knowing that my parents were grateful and excited that I was leaving them, there was a smirking expression on their faces as I drove off with only my duffel bag that contained my clothes, hygiene products, money, and phone, everything else that was important to me, that I wanted to bring with me moving away.



Leaving my family wasn't easy, but it was a step towards accepting my true self, a journey I was learning to embrace.



Leaving my family wasn't easy, but it was a step towards accepting my true self, a journey I was learning to embrace. I would wake up angry and sad, and would still be that way, but knowing that and being able to move out has proven to me that I am broken and free from the psychological prison I was being held in as a part of my family.



I knew that I was going to grow old and die alone, but that was good enough for me. Still, I couldn't let that be my focus right now; I needed to get to Oregon on time so that I could meet the seller and she could show me the possible new home I was going to make for myself.



Driving through extreme weather, such as snow, blizzards, and high winds, and having to sleep in the car, which was highly uncomfortable for me, I knew that if my mother were in the car with me, she would become tense around me.



However, I was able to relax and not worry about that. Not anymore.



Continuing to drive to my destination, which took about three days to reach — equivalent to 72 hours of non-stop driving — I had to grab a cup of coffee so that I could stay awake enough to continue driving.



Making sure to save my gas money, Wisley, and just enough for me to use to get where I needed to go.



After three days of brushing my teeth and showering in a public shower that I had come to appreciate in one of the free and public campgrounds, I was able to prepare myself to meet the woman. This realtor was going to show me the house.



Cleaning myself up, I drove for another hour and a half and was able to find the road that would lead me to where I needed to go.



Assuming everything was going to go just fine, I received a sudden notification on my worn-out mobile smartphone about a weather warning. The warning indicated that a sudden rainstorm was expected to cause minor issues. This wave of weather was intended to shut down the road I was on.



Waiting it out from the rainstorm and taking a moment to follow the line of cars that were slowly moving past, the rain was like my windshield wipers moving at a high-speed pace as I continued on the wet concrete.



Unsure what would happen, but once I reached the cabin, I thought the whole weather event was a fluke. So I inferred that I wasn't really a big fan of what the news reported, assuming that all the information you watch on TV or read is negative. And that's just how the world worked, unfortunately.



After I was interrupted from my train of thought, I didn't see the realtor, her car, or any sign outside the intricate cabin, which was wonderful indeed. From the outside, it is brand new, fresh out of the workshop.



Just looking at it made my day, and I was able to feel more at 



Suddenly, when I got out of the car, I saw a note on the door to the cabin.



After setting up the only place I had in the cabin that I was able to rent and stay in as long as I paid the monthly rent, to was surinsluy when i looked at the place online on site called Zillow, and the paymnet was amonthly which was $25, which was small but intricate enough for me to be in and hopefully rest during the last days of my life, after the whole incident back in Reno, NV, and knowing that I had to leave.



I realized that they no longer wanted me, and that's okay. Not all living things will appreciate or tolerate my existence, and I've come to accept that. In life, I've learned that you must love yourself. Don't rely on others for your love, because sooner or later, they may not love you anymore.



That lesson was a testament to my resilience, a strength that I alone could fully appreciate and would have to prove to myself through suffering. 



I've been so tired of being hated all my life. People hated me because I was different, and when I say that, I mean I was mentally different. I have a disorder called ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder. 



It's a form of development that makes it hard for you to fit into a world where people who think they are normal, with all the people who happen to be normal to them, and outside that circle are those whom other people consider freaks or retards.



I tried going to groups in the hope that people would be in the same situation I was in, but they weren't. They didn't care or even support the damage I was going through, and that was okay. Humans are careless creatures, and sometimes I would think I was negligent. 



I could live independently and peacefully with the income I would receive from the government. It's almost been a week or two, and I was trying to light a fire in the fireplace, which the cabin had a real one of, so I endeavored to do that. I had to walk to the closest store down the hill in the small town of Oregon, where I was currently situated. With that, I found the store selling the supplies I needed to build my fireplace. Still, that didn't stop me when I noticed a slightly tall woman, about 6'2"", wearing goth pitch black leather or dress-like clothing. 



All of the clouds of colors were pitch black.



I noticed she had pitch black long hair and somewhat pale skin, but not too pale. Assuming it was just the makeup she used, yet I could see that she had light tan skin and a nose ring piercing under her small, yet pretty, nose. She seemed to be focused until I saw her eyes look slightly at me, so I retracted my gaze, trying not to act like some creep. 



I knew she thought it looked gross because I had worn clothes and a beard that made me look like a slightly menacing and dangerous-looking lumberjack. I retreated to my focus, ignoring the woman who happened to be in the food aisle at the store. At the same time, I shopped around for the right supplies for my cabin.



Once I had gathered the proper tools for my fireplace, I went to the cash register and thanked God that it was a self-checkout system. So, I was able to scan my supplies using my card. But just as I was about to start scanning the last two items I had and put them in the plastic grocery bag hanging on the opposite side of where I was storing my belongings, I heard a female voice ask for my name, and I froze.



**""… Adam?""** I stopped what I was doing. That voice—hearing it, I could still remember hearing it a hundred times over. The voice that originated from was someone who bullied me and hated my existence—someone who hated me just for being me.



Kala, Jan, an asian transfer student who attended my school, was a know-it-all and knew more about things than I did. When she first laid eyes on me, I knew she hated me; everyone from my old school did.



She would call me names or push me around and be a complete jerk to me, and at that moment, I lost my cool and slammed my fist against her face, which caused her to flinch and be slammed hard against the head. 



I was suspended and expelled from school, and had to hear from my family. Not the other part of my family, and that was hard, but nobody cared, and I was okay with that. They didn't want to hear my side of the story; they didn't care.



I was sure that I would react to this. I sighed, taking a minute to catch my breath, before turning and looking up at the slightly tall and yet menacing figure of my high school bully.



She looked at me with hopefulness and something else I hadn't seen in a long time: kindness. But I didn't know why she was talking to me.



**""Why did she want to talk to me?""** I wondered.



**""Doesn't she have other things to do besides talk to me?""**



Back to my current situation, she then asked, **""Are you Adam? I'm sorry, it's just you look familiar.""**



**""…Yes, that's me.""**



**""Oh my gosh, hi, I'm—""**



**""Kala Jan, yes, I know who you are.""** She looked a little surprised that I knew her name, but since there was nothing else to talk about, I went back to scanning my groceries.



**""So, are you new around here, or are you visiting?""** she asked, but the more she asked this question, the more I felt tricked, just because I knew she was asking those questions to start a conversation.



**""… I live here.""**



**""Really? Where?""**



I didn't say anything, so with that, I grabbed my bag of things and walked out the sliding door, leaving her clueless and yet confused.



Returning to the cabin, I sighed in relief. Here, I could be myself, free from the judgment of others.



The supplies for the fireplace included a small yet sizable wood iron grill tray, typically used for real fireplaces, a bag of firestarter pouches, a box of matches, and a lighter in case the matches didn't work at some point.



Returning my focus to the fireplace, I aim to finish it so that I can get everything settled once the sun goes down and the temperature outside drops. The fire in the UT bag begins to ignite and light up.



**""There we go,""** I muttered, carrying my internal thoughts with high hopes that this fireplace was still functional enough to work.

Taking a moment to observe my accomplishment, I see the bright colors intertwining with each other.



Suddenly, I heard a voice, and I turned to see something dark, a shadow in the corner where the light didn't shine. Someone, or something, whom I hadn't seen in a long time - a long-time friend that was dead but had been talking to me since I was a kid. Yet, he stopped coming, and he was my brother, my half-brother.



**""Hey jack.""**



**""….Adam.""**



**""long time?""**



**""that it has.""**



**""Hm, time doesn't seem to flow the way it works from where I am,""** Jack said, 



It wasn't assumed from his worn words. 



Yet, he was sad and emotional, yet unemotional, as evidenced by the wrinkled face he had; he looked weak, like a piece of paper that had aged over the years. The wrinkles and color of the paper would fade over an extended period.



**""…Its been about 8 years.""**



**""Hm, would make sense.""** 



**""…Why are you here?""**



**""… I'm here because of what I saw, the world's darker now, there's less love and kindness to this world, Adam, and you seem to be the only one of these people that has that.""**



**""And I want to remind you, don't you ever lose that, the world needs it, and you're the only one of all of us who has it.""**



**""Duly noted.""**



**""I'm serious, Adam.""**



**""There are things out there, things I can't explain, and they feed on fear. You don't have that; you have something they fear the most.""**



**""What's that?""**



**""The only thing people hate the most is anger, rage, and sadness. Those are what made you who you are today. But remember... use them for good. Don't let them control you, because if you do, it will never be the same, and you'll never be able to go back.""**



**""...Okay.""**



**""Remember, the secret to the highest of all of us is in your hands.""**



""What?"" I asked, unsure of whom or what, my only friend, who cared about me.



Suddenly, I heard a knock on my front door. I looked toward the door but then turned my head back, only to see nothing. My brother was gone.



Turning my gaze back to the door, I walked over to it, brushed my hand on the rusted handle, turned it, and swung it open. To my surprise, it was someone I wasn't happy to see—the only person I hated, and possibly hate even now.



It was Kala Jan.



**""...Hi,""** she said. She seemed awkward, as if she didn't usually speak to me, which left me confused and irritated by her presence. ***""Great, now she knows where I live,""*** I thought.



""What are you doing here?"" I asked flatly, but I regretted that sentence as soon as I said it.



**""I... look, I'm sorry,""** she said. Her tone was filled with regret and shame. It was dark and cold, and the night was pitch black. The only light I had was the outdoor porch light hanging above the cabin's doorframe on the side.



**""For what?""** I asked, playing dumb to make sure she wasn't as naïve as she looked. I wasn't going to lie; she looked beautiful. 



Sorry, I shouldn't have said that; people hated it when I said certain things.



Noticing she looked wet, despite holding an umbrella, she looked damp from the cold and moist atmosphere, unsure of what to do in this situation. 



Even though I had a habit against her, knowing that just leaving someone in there was hurtful, and I didn't want to be that kind of person.



**""I can tell you are cold and wet.""**



She looked from me to her clothing, and then back, a slight grimace on her face at the slight reveal and obvious observations.



**""I know we don't share agreement, but you can come in.""** Taking a big side step, a gesture for her to let her inside.



She nodded and gave me a small yet noticeable smile on her black-lipstick-painted lips.



**""Thank you.""**



**""... You're welcome,""** I muttered, in hopes she heard me.



But she probably didn't care what I had to say.



Once she was inside, I closed the door, not caring to lock it, and noticed she was struggling with something. Her clothing, and so with that, I was able to walk over and help her with the jacket slightly. She was somewhat surprised, but I just shrugged it off and set her coat near the fireplace.



To ensure safety, I pulled out the fireplace guard cage that came with the cabin. I hoped this would prevent the ashes from coming into contact with the fabric and causing any significant issues, like starting a fire in the cabin.



I looked up to her only to notice her looking around, and so, with that, I cleared my throat to get her attention. She returned her gaze to me, and I asked gruffly, **""Are you okay with this?""** I wondered plainly, but in hopes she wouldn't cause any issue with my question.



She nodded, and I stood back up, crossing my arms and looking at her slightly up, to dispel our height differences. She looked at me with curiosity.



**""Why are you here?""**



**""...I just wanted to know how you were.""**



I looked at her unmoved, and she seemed to notice from my gaze that I wasn't buying her answer.



**""Okay, I came** because **I want to say that I'm sorry.""** She didn't say it rudely or hurtfully, but she cared, and her tone was sincere. She was strong enough to come to me and apologize.



I was grateful, but I didn't understand after all those years. Kala, a transfer student who hated my guts, just magically appeared in the town, which I had hoped was a haven for me, and she appeared out of the blue. 



After a moment of profound and disconcerting silence that crept between the two of us in the only room of the cabin we were in.



I wasn't sure what else to say to her. The only thing that was confier soundable was the crackle of the firewood being eaten by the red and yellow flames of the fire illuminating the two shadows who happened to be us.



But something about her noticing something, yet her eyes seemed to illuminate from the depths, a mix of rose colors with bright reds. I was unsure what she was looking at me for, glancing slightly as if she was trying to do something I was clueless about.



Her gaze seemed to convey a mixture of determination, a hint of predatory instincts, and a look of thirst, but I didn't know that; I was just a naïve person when it came to such scenarios.



Knowing something was up and she was doing something, but wasn't sure what it was.



And what concerned me the most was that the small, dark pieces of the fire that I was unable to reveal or shine upon, her eyes started to glow slightly.



Suddenly, I noticed my brother emerging from the depths of the shadows, the dark voices that the fire could not illuminate or reveal, and looking at me with a mixture of fear and anger on his face, he mouthed something to me and pointed to her with his finger.



**""She is dangerous,""** Jack mouthed.



She caught my gaze over her shoulder, and when she started to see where I was looking, there was nothing there. With that, it allowed me to realize she wasn't here to apologize; she was here to do what in God's name to me.



She caught me in the very instant of my act. She, out of strange yet powerful agility, grabbed me by the shoulders with her hand, to which I looked at the very last second that turned into claws, and flung me with her arms to swing me away from the wall of the living room, and fell hard on the ground.



My body felt heavy from the impact and hard to breathe, my hearing was hard to fathom, and the echo of footsteps greeted me. To know that whoever this woman was, she was once human, and she wanted to hurt me, and I wasn't going to let that happen.



Slightly getting up on my knees, but only for her to grip me by her menacing hand around my throat, feeling the tight and iron-embraced grip nevlop around my neck.



She drew me close to her face, and at that moment, I started to feel my feet slightly rise from the ground, and she did as well. We were just inches from the ground, and our bodies touched in some places, particularly on the fine, smooth, delicate parts.



I was struggling using my bare hand to try and break loose, but her grip was as solid as a rock, as if her entire muscular structure was all made of stone itself. She smirked at me, and that very moment brought memories of when my family put me down for the last remaining parts of my life.



**""I…I am…not…going…to be…pinned ever….Again!""** At that last word, I said, a sudden, instinctive force exploded, causing the menacing woman before me to break her grip around my neck and fall hard. I felt down too, but I got back up. With her still down and struggling to comprehend the sudden action I just created, I grabbed one of the tools from the fireplace. I marched over to her with an enraged expression on my face.



Ignoring the physical pain in my throat, I was too angry to think about that right now.



She assumed the worst, that I was going to strike her, but only just inches from her face, I swung the object onto the ground, inches before her head. She looked at it, to where it was marked on the flooring and towards me.



**""Consider that a warning,""** I said, my tone menacing and harsh, in the hope that what I had just told her would get through to her perfectly loud and clear.



Grabbing her things, I tossed them to her and used my power to switch the lock, unlocking it and causing the door to swing open hard, causing her to jump back from it and slam against the inside wall of the room.



**""Get out.""**



**""Adam, that-that wasn't-""**



**""Get OUT!""** With so much fury and pain and rage, it shook the cabin, ever so slightly, yet Kala got the message.  Quickly, she grabbed her things, yet it was still raining. She looked at me one more time, only to see rage in my eyes. My brows furrowed to the depth that would allow me to show genuine emotion, true human emotion.



She understood and complied, but before I could shut the door with the powers I had before I was born, I told myself not to use them again. However, this night, this day was different. There was something evil out there, and the girl I once knew, who was a jerk to me, was different. But right now, she needed to leave, and I needed sleep.



She did so, she stopped turning to me and asked, What happened to you?""



**""I should ask you the same thing,""** was the last thing I said before slamming the door in front of her.



Locking the door and closing any drapes to where the cabin had to be, where the windows stood from the darkness and wet weather happening outside.



**""Well…""**



I turned to the origin of the voice. I saw my brother standing there, holding his hand, stogethreading, and walked over to reveal himself to the light of the fireplace.



**""That was interesting.""**



**""…right""** was what I said.



I walked away, leaving the living room and leaving him confused.



**""Where are you going?""** His head was looking in the direction where I was going.



**""I'm going to bed.""**



Leaving my ghost brother confused, I ignored him and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and go to bed, hoping all of this was just a dream.



Changing into something more home-wear-based, I wanted to unravel my sleeping bag, yet it was the closest thing I had to a bed on which to sleep.



Once I was in and ready to rest my eyes for the night, the sound of the thunder, flashes of lightning, and rain dripping from the roof of the cabin caused me to go to sleep quickly. The sounds of nature helped me fall asleep more easily.



**""Let's hope this was all just a dream,""** I muttered before my eyelids started to drop, leaving me in the deep void of nothingness.

## Key Features Analysis

The coffee machine with hot water dispenser combines the functionalities of two separate appliances into one, offering space-saving convenience and streamlined operation.

**Brewing Capacity**

Brewing capacity is a crucial aspect, determining the amount of coffee that can be brewed at once. Many models offer capacities ranging from 10 to 14 cups, suitable for both individual use and larger households or office settings. Some machines feature programmable settings, allowing users to customize the brew strength and volume to their preferences. The quality of the brewing process, including temperature control and pre-infusion features, also significantly impacts the final taste of the coffee.

**Hot Water Dispenser Capacity and Temperature**

The hot water dispenser's capacity is another key consideration, as it dictates the amount of hot water available for various uses. Typically, these dispensers hold between 30 and 50 ounces of water. The temperature control is equally important, allowing users to select the optimal temperature for different beverages or food preparations. Some advanced models offer precise temperature settings, ensuring that the water is heated to the exact degree required for specific types of tea or instant soups.

**Filtration System**

A high-quality filtration system is essential for removing impurities from the water, enhancing both the taste of the coffee and the longevity of the machine. Many coffee machines with hot water dispensers incorporate activated carbon filters, which effectively remove chlorine, sediment, and other contaminants. Some models also include water hardness testing kits, allowing users to adjust the filtration settings to match their local water supply. Regular filter replacement is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and water quality.

**Programmability and User Interface**

Programmability features enhance the user experience by allowing for customized brewing schedules and settings. Many machines offer programmable timers, allowing users to set the coffee to brew automatically at a specific time. A user-friendly interface, typically featuring an LCD screen and intuitive controls, makes it easy to navigate the various settings and functions. Some models also include smartphone connectivity, enabling users to control the machine remotely and monitor its status.

**Safety Features**

Safety features are paramount, especially considering the presence of hot water and electrical components. Automatic shut-off is a standard safety feature that turns off the machine after a period of inactivity, preventing overheating and potential hazards. Overheat protection mechanisms also ensure that the machine does not exceed safe operating temperatures. Some models include insulated carafes or dispensers to prevent accidental burns.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Ease of cleaning and maintenance is an important factor for long-term usability. Many coffee machines with hot water dispensers feature removable parts that are dishwasher-safe, simplifying the cleaning process. Descaling programs are also common, helping to remove mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for preventing malfunctions and extending the lifespan of the machine.

## Core Benefits

The coffee machine with hot water dispenser provides a multitude of advantages, streamlining beverage preparation and offering enhanced convenience.

**Time Savings:** Combining coffee brewing and hot water dispensing into one appliance saves valuable time in the morning or during busy workdays. Users can quickly brew a pot of coffee and simultaneously prepare tea or other hot beverages without needing separate appliances. This efficiency is particularly beneficial for households or offices with multiple beverage preferences.

**Space Efficiency:** In kitchens with limited counter space, a combination coffee machine and hot water dispenser is a practical solution. It eliminates the need for two separate appliances, freeing up valuable space for other kitchen essentials. This is especially advantageous for apartment dwellers or those with smaller kitchens.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment may be higher than purchasing separate appliances, a combination coffee machine and hot water dispenser can offer long-term cost savings. By consolidating two functions into one, it reduces energy consumption and eliminates the need to purchase and maintain two separate appliances.

**Versatility:** The versatility of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser extends beyond coffee and tea preparation. The hot water dispenser can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making instant soups, oatmeal, or other hot foods. This versatility makes it a valuable addition to any kitchen, catering to a wide range of culinary needs.

**Convenience:** The convenience of having both coffee and hot water readily available from a single appliance cannot be overstated. Whether it's for a quick morning coffee, an afternoon tea, or preparing a simple meal, the coffee machine with hot water dispenser offers unparalleled convenience. The programmable features and user-friendly interface further enhance the overall user experience.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee machines with hot water dispensers.

**What type of water should I use in my coffee machine with hot water dispenser?**
  Using filtered water is highly recommended to improve the taste of your coffee and tea, and to prevent mineral buildup in the machine. Tap water can contain chlorine and other impurities that affect the flavor and can also lead to scale formation, reducing the machine's lifespan.

  Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing malfunctions. The frequency of cleaning depends on the frequency of use and the hardness of your water. Generally, it is recommended to clean the machine every 1-3 months, or more frequently if you notice mineral buildup or a change in the taste of your coffee. Descaling the machine regularly is also important.

**Can I use the hot water dispenser for purposes other than making tea or coffee?**
  Yes, the hot water dispenser can be used for a variety of purposes, such as making instant soups, oatmeal, or other hot foods. It is a versatile appliance that can cater to a wide range of culinary needs. However, it is important to ensure that the water is heated to the appropriate temperature for the specific application.

**What is the average lifespan of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser?**
  The lifespan of a coffee machine with hot water dispenser depends on several factors, including the quality of the machine, the frequency of use, and the level of maintenance. With proper care and maintenance, a high-quality machine can last for 5-7 years or more. Regular cleaning, descaling, and using filtered water can significantly extend the lifespan of the machine.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Percolator

Selecting the [perfect coffee percolator](https://gomehedi.com/best-percolator-coffee-maker/) involves understanding how to use it effectively. Fill the pot with water, add your favorite ground coffee, and place it on the stove. Watch for the gentle percolation sound, signaling rich coffee ready to enjoy.

Choosing the right coffee percolator can make all the difference in your morning routine. Whether you’re a seasoned coffee aficionado or a curious beginner, understanding the nuances of different models can elevate your coffee experience. Selecting the perfect percolator isn’t just about the brand name; it’s about finding a model that suits your lifestyle and coffee preferences.

# Materials And Build Quality

The material of a coffee percolator affects both its durability and flavor. Stainless steel models are popular for their longevity and resistance to stains. They can withstand high temperatures, ensuring your coffee is brewed to perfection. On the other hand, glass percolators offer a visually pleasing brewing process, allowing you to watch the magic happen. However, they are more fragile and require careful handling. Consider your kitchen environment. If kids or pets are around, stainless steel might be safer. If aesthetics are important, a glass model could be a delightful addition.

# Electric Vs. Stovetop Models

Electric percolators are convenient. They offer automatic brewing with consistent results, perfect for busy mornings. You simply plug it in, add water and coffee, and let the machine do the work. They’re ideal for those who prefer ease and reliability. Stovetop models, however, provide a more hands-on experience. They let you control the brewing time and temperature, which can lead to a richer flavor. If you enjoy the ritual of brewing coffee, the stovetop model offers a rewarding process. Which one suits your lifestyle? If you value convenience and consistency, electric is your friend. If you savor the art of coffee making, the stovetop model might be your best match.

# Preparing Your Coffee Percolator

Brewing coffee with a percolator is an art. It starts with proper preparation. This ensures a rich and flavorful cup of coffee. The steps are simple yet crucial. From cleaning to selecting the right grind, each step matters.

# Cleaning And Assembling

Start by cleaning your coffee percolator. Rinse all parts with warm water. Use mild soap to remove old coffee oils. Scrub gently to avoid scratches. Dry all parts completely. This prevents rust and mold. Assemble the percolator correctly. Place the stem in the pot. Attach the basket on top. Ensure the lid fits securely. A tight seal is key for brewing.

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a sec. Have you ever found yourself just... stuck? 🥴 You know what I’m talking about—you spend hours (maybe even DAYS) spinning your wheels over that one project or decision. You’re juggling options, analyzing every angle, and by the end, you’ve made zero progress. Sound familiar? 

**Enter: The 5-Minute Rule.** 🎉 This little gem has saved me from the clutches of perfectionism more times than I can count. It’s super simple: if you spend just **five minutes** on something and you’ve gotten it to a point where it’s *good enough,* then guess what? It’s DONE. 

Here’s why this works:

- **Perfection is an illusion.** Seriously, there’s no such thing as perfect. You could tweak and polish something forever, but at what cost?
- **Five minutes is manageable.** Who can’t spare five minutes? Even if you feel overwhelmed, just seeing what you can accomplish in that short time can shift your perspective.
- **Momentum matters.** The hardest part is often just starting. By giving yourself permission to let go of “perfect,” you create a chance for momentum to kick in. You know, that magical feeling when you’re on a roll? 🚀 

So, how do we actually put this into practice? Here are some ideas:

1. **Set a timer.** Literally, just grab your phone and set a five-minute countdown. You’d be surprised how productive you can get with that little deadline hovering over you!
  
2. **Define “done.”** Before you dive in, ask yourself: What does “done” look like for this task? Is it sending an email, drafting an outline, or creating a quick sketch? Write it down!

3. **Make it fun.** If you can make the process enjoyable, you’re more likely to dive in. Throw on your favorite playlist, make a nice cup of coffee, or reward yourself with a small treat afterward.

4. **Embrace imperfection.** It’s okay if it’s not 100% what you envisioned. Remember, you can always improve later, but if you keep waiting for perfection, you might miss some awesome opportunities.

And hey, it’s not about being reckless! You still want to ensure quality. But sometimes you gotta throw caution to the wind and JUST DO IT. 

**Quick story time:** I used to agonize over my blog posts for days, sitting at my desk staring at a blinking cursor. Then, I started applying this 5-minute rule. One day, I set my timer and just wrote. It wasn’t my best work, but I hit publish! Guess what? That post got more engagement than I thought it would. Crazy, right? 😵

So, next time you find yourself caught in that spiral of thought, just remember that *done is better than perfect.* And who knows? You might end up surprising yourself with what you create in just five minutes!

1mb5fkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1mb5fkc/stressed_scattered_i_tried_cold_exposure_box/,Stressed & Scattered? 🧠 I Tried Cold Exposure + Box Breathing for 7 Days: Here’s My Nervous System Reset (Backed by HRV Data) 🌬️,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever feel like your brain is doing the cha-cha while you’re trying to focus on life's waltz? You're not alone! 🤯 Last week, I was all kinds of scattered—like trying to herd cats while juggling (seriously, who can relate?). I decided to give my nervous system a little *reset* by trying something new: **Cold Exposure + Box Breathing for 7 Days**. Let me spill the icy tea. ❄️

First off, **what's box breathing?** Picture this: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, and hold for another 4. Easy peasy, right? But pair that with cold exposure (yes, I'm talking ice baths or super cold showers), and you've got yourself a spicy little cocktail for calming those frayed nerves! 🛁

**Day 1:** ***Shock therapy*** anyone?! Jumped into the cold, regretted every life decision for about 10 seconds, then actually started feeling... alive? And hey, that box breathing? Well, it kept me from sprinting for the warm blankets, so win-win!

**By Day 3:** My body was like, ""Hey, this isn't so bad."" My focus was clearer, and the overwhelming urge to snack every 20 minutes mysteriously vanished. It felt like my mind was finally in sync with the *rest* of me.

**Day 5:** HRV (heart rate variability) data check! 📊 Spoiler: It was awesome! My body's stress response was more chill than me on a Saturday morning. Think of your HRV like a window into how relaxed (or not) your nervous system is. Let's just say, mine was throwing a low-key beach party!

**By Day 7:** Who even needs caffeine? (Just kidding, I still love coffee.) But honestly, the combo of cold exposure with deliberate breathing felt like I’d cleared away mental cobwebs. The scattered feeling? Practically gone! 🎉

Here’s what I learned, and why I think you might wanna try it too:

- **Instant Zen:** The shock of cold paired with controlled breathing forces you into the present moment. Kind of like instant meditation on steroids. 💪
  
- **Energy Boost:** After the initial OMG-I’m-gonna-freeze moment, there’s a rush of energy and vitality. It’s like someone hit the refresh button on your brain.

- **Focus Galore:** Forget multitasking chaos; clarity actually becomes a thing. Who knew cold could cure mental clutter?

On February 19th, I started drinking Monster as a kind of game, having one daily, sometimes with breaks of 3 or 4 days. I even had two Monsters in a single day once (just that one time). This continued until May 18th, when I started experiencing mild chest pains and a racing heart, so I decided to stop.
I completely cut out Monster and replaced it with iced tea and caffeine-free cold drinks because I'm worried and want my heart to be healthy. For about a month, I was pain-free for a while, and in that time I even had a regular checkup with my primary care provider and all the blood work and auscultation was okay, but a few weeks ago, I woke up at 2 AM with a very fast heartbeat and nausea. I got a bit scared, but I layed down after eating a banana (in case my blood sugar was low) and fell back asleep. However, in the afternoon, the nausea and racing heart returned. These symptoms went on for a while, until some weeks later they stopped for a few days. Then, the other day the same thing happened again, and it hasn't relieved by now. These symptoms do not occur all the time, by example when I'm distracted or whatever i feel on peace. I don't know if I'm at risk for a heart condition, if it's just anxiety, or if something else is going on. I don't plan on drinking Monster or coffee again for a long time, but I would like a professional cardiologist's opinion.

Six months ago, I was struggling. I had just been laid off from a tech company, nothing I did wrong, just a business decision out of my control. Like most, I threw myself into job applications… and got almost nowhere. Interviews were tough to come by.

To change things up, I started reaching out to former colleagues, not to ask for jobs, but just to reconnect and explore ideas. I thought maybe a conversation would open a door.

To my surprise, many didn’t respond. Some ignored me completely. It was a bit discouraging, and honestly, pretty isolating.

Fast forward to today. I’ve landed a dream role with a high-growth, GenAI player. And now… the same people who didn’t respond are suddenly popping into my inbox to say congrats and ask to catch up..

Here’s the point: please don’t ignore those messages from people asking for 15 minutes of your time (If possible). It might not mean much to you, but it could mean the world to someone on the other end who’s going through a rough patch.

Last month was awful! I hadn’t had too many days of side effects before last month. Now I have theses terrible burps that taste and smell rancid. They are so bad that they make me throw up. When I throw up it’s always really old food sometimes undigested, sometimes it’s watery. It always smells even worse than the burps. On top of that I have this awful diarrhea. The only way I can get the burps to stop is to drink some coffee which upsets my stomach and sort of forces it to “drain” or throw up. I’ve noticed it’s better when I take my antacids regularly. It’s just so gross to think of all that food basically rotting inside of me and I want it out. Problem is it’s sort of triggering for me to throw up that food because of a prior ED.

I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for about 8 months now, and overall our relationship has been going well. We communicate decently and care a lot about each other. But there's one thing I’ve been sitting with, and I wanted an outside perspective.

My girlfriend is very socially active and goes to a lot of networking events, which I fully support. She’s ambitious, independent, and great at building connections. Sometimes after these events, she’ll meet up with someone one-on-one, and I don’t usually find out who it was until after, if at all. For example, she recently had a networking event and ended up getting coffee with someone for about two hours. 

When I asked her about it later, she didn’t really share much; no name or details, just kind of moved on. And this has happened before. Sometimes when she hangs out with friends, she’ll say “I’m going to hang out with a friend” or “doing X” but won’t offer more unless I specifically ask. She’s always willing to answer questions, but I don’t want to feel like I have to interview her to stay in the loop.

For the record, I trust her. She’s bisexual, but I don’t think gender changes anything here. I just want a general sense of openness. I trust that she wouldn’t keep in contact with people she’s had romantic or physical history with. This isn’t about suspicion. it’s about feeling like I’m connected to her day-to-day life. I try to be really open about who I spend time with, and I’d feel more secure if that openness went both ways.

She’s also not a secretive person in general. she even suggested we share locations early on (she shares locations with her friends too, more as a safety thing). So I don’t think this is intentional, but it still leaves me feeling like a part of her world is walled off unless I ask about it.

I want to bring this up gently, without sounding controlling or jealous, because that’s not where I’m coming from. I just value transparency and feeling emotionally included. Is it fair to ask for that kind of openness? And what’s a good way to bring it up without making it a big deal?

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR
My girlfriend (24F) sometimes meets one-on-one with people (she’s bi, so gender doesn’t matter here) but doesn’t usually tell me who they are unless I ask. I trust her, but I’d feel more emotionally connected if she were a bit more open about her social plans. I don’t want to seem jealous. I just want more natural transparency. Am I being unreasonable?

1mb537z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialLiteracyPH/comments/1mb537z/pisoproof_your_wallet_math_mindset_methods_saving/,"Piso-Proof Your Wallet: {Math, Mindset & Methods} Saving Tips That You Should Know","LET'S face it — sometimes, you can say that saving now can feel impossible. You’re battling uncertainties, low wages, toxic family expectations, and impulsive spending temptations every single day.

But with smart planning, behavioral tricks, and math on your side — **you CAN beat the system**.

---

# 🎯 1. Set a Tangible, Emotion-Based Goal

**Why it matters**: Saving is psychological. When your “why” is real (a sick parent, a dream business), you're less likely to spend emotionally.

**Better goal**: ""I want to build a ₱50,000 emergency fund in 10 months to avoid utang during emergencies.""

📊 **Math**: ₱50,000 ÷ 10 = ₱5,000/month  
→ ₱167/day. Save this by cooking more, cancelling that streaming subscription, or getting a ₱500/week sideline.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Print your goal and track your progress visually. Behavioral science proves visible milestones motivate better than vague intentions.

---

# 🤖 2. Automate Your Savings, Then Hide It

Set up an auto-transfer to a separate digital bank with no debit card access.

**Scenario**: Earn ₱18,000/month  
Auto-save ₱1,500 → After 12 months = ₱18,000

📌 *Tip*: Use banks with interest rates 3–6% p.a. — your savings won’t just sit, they’ll grow passively.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Rename your account to ""Do Not Touch — For Emergency Only"" to create a psychological barrier before withdrawing.

---

# 📈 3. Track Expenses Religiously for 30 Days

**Why**: You can’t fix what you don’t measure. Most Filipinos don’t realize they spend ₱5,000–₱7,000/month on avoidable habits.

**How**:
- Use Monefy or Wallet app  
- Log everything manually for 30 days (this creates “pain of paying”)

**Real Case**:  
A jeep + coffee + fast food habit =  
₱40 x 2 (jeep) + ₱150 (milk tea) + ₱250 (lunch) = ₱480/day  
→ ₱9,600/month gone.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Your budget doesn’t fail from big purchases — it's the **daily ₱200 leaks** that drown you.

---

# 💼 4. Minimum Wage Earner Blueprint

Minimum wage: ~₱610/day → ~₱13,000/month (NCR estimate after deductions)

**Realistic Saving**: Save ₱50/day = ₱1,500/month  
→ ₱18,000/year

**Challenge**: Do a “no-spend weekend” every 2 weeks  
→ Save ₱500–₱1,000/month from leisure/transport expenses

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Use “replacement psychology” — instead of spending ₱150 on milk tea, brew ₱10 on your own and move the ₱140 to your savings.

---

# 🎓 5. Student Savings Without a Job

📌 Average baon: ₱150/day  
→ Save ₱30/day (20%) = ₱660/month  
In 10 months = ₱6,600 — enough for a used phone, certification, or startup capital

🧠 *Mindset Trick*: Convert spending into opportunity cost.  
“Do I want this burger or a future side hustle?”

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Open a digital savings account early. Financial literacy improves dramatically when you manage even small amounts.

---

# 🌍 6. OFW Financial Framework

📌 Sending ₱20,000/month home? Keep at least ₱5,000/month for yourself.

💼 Scenario: Save ₱5,000/month in Pag-IBIG MP2  
→ After 5 years with 6% avg. dividend: ~₱340,000+

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Many OFWs return broke because they never saved for *themselves*. Build “non-negotiable self-pay” into every remittance.

---

# 🆘 7. Build an Emergency Fund — Your Financial Shield

Target: 3–6 months’ worth of expenses  
Example: ₱15,000/month budget → ₱45,000–₱90,000 fund

**Plan**: Save ₱1,875/month  
→ ₱45,000 in 24 months

💡 *Behavioral trick*: Store this in a separate account with **no mobile access** — out of sight = out of reach.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Start small if needed. Even ₱500/month builds discipline.

---

# 🔁 8. Grow Income First, Lifestyle Second

**Don’t just budget — increase income**  
Options:
- Freelance writing, VA, ESL  
- Buy & sell via TikTok Shop or Shopee  
- Teach basic skills (Canva, Excel) online

📊 Scenario: ₱4,000/month extra income  
→ Save 70% = ₱2,800 x 12 = ₱33,600/year

🧠 *Rule*: “Lifestyle freeze” — when you earn more, **don’t increase spending for 6 months**. Save the difference.

🔎 *Practical Insight*: Income you earn *without increasing lifestyle* compounds the fastest.

While I was traveling last week, my wife was home and said we had big storm. Thunder, lighting and rain, but no damage to our home. The power in our home actually never went out. 

That said, since then, electricity in our home has been acting up ever since. Occasionally lights in our home will flicker or wobble, in different rooms and at different times. This will happen even if we barely have anything running in the whole house, so I don’t think it is about us using a lot of stuff at once. Besides lighting, our toaster oven is now intermittently turning on and off, even when not in use. I think it is losing its minimum threshold for power and turning off, beeping back on, etc. I have once noticed a similar wobbling in the LED on my coffee machine, at the same time the toaster oven was acting up. Today I noticed the light in my garage will flick on with the switch, for one second, and then cut out. All of this seems to have been caused by the storm. 

All I’ve done, or frankly know how to do, is go to my breaker. I switched everything off at once. Waited a bit. Then switched everything back on. The issue has persisted though.

I have a hunch that it’s more about the power supply than my home itself. So I don’t know if I should be calling an electrician? I figured I’d start with posting here. If you tell me I should be calling the city, or my electricity utility company instead, I’ll do that. 

For context, in case it matters, I’m based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Thanks in advance!

The pup cup,a seemingly simple concoction of whipped cream served in a small cup,has rapidly evolved from a niche offering at select coffee shops to a mainstream treat beloved by dogs adn their owners alike. This seemingly trivial indulgence has become a symbol of the human-animal bond and a notable driver of customer engagement for businesses. As we enter 2025, it's time to take a closer look at the pup cup and explore its potential as the ultimate treat for our canine companions.This review will examine the pup cup's features,benefits,and its position within the broader market of dog-friendly treats,offering a comprehensive assessment of its value and appeal.

## Key Features Analysis

The pup cup's appeal lies in its simplicity and widespread availability. Though, variations in ingredients and presentation contribute to its overall quality.

**Ingredient Composition**

While the base of a pup cup is typically whipped cream,the quality and source of this cream greatly influence the treat's safety and nutritional value. A superior pup cup uses heavy cream with minimal additives, avoiding artificial sweeteners or excessive sugar. Some establishments also offer dairy-free alternatives made from coconut or soy-based whipped toppings, catering to dogs with sensitivities. The use of natural vanilla extract is considered a plus, adding a subtle flavor that appeals to some dogs.

**Cup material and Size**

The cup itself plays a role in the overall experience. Smaller portions are ideal for puppies and small breeds, preventing overindulgence. Sturdy, food-grade paper or compostable cups are preferred for environmental reasons and to prevent potential chemical leaching. A cup that is easy for dogs to access without tipping over also enhances the enjoyment.

**Presentation and Customization**

Beyond the basic whipped cream, some establishments offer creative pup cup variations. These might include a sprinkle of dog-friendly toppings, such as crushed dog biscuits, a drizzle of peanut butter, or a single blueberry. Visually appealing presentations can increase the pup cup's perceived value and make it a more shareable experience on social media. Customization allows owners to cater to their dog's specific tastes and dietary needs, further enhancing the experience.**Nutritional Considerations**

It is indeed vital to acknowledge the nutritional impact of pup cups, even in the context of an occasional treat. High-quality pup cups minimize unhealthy ingredients like sugar and artificial additives. Offering smaller serving sizes and providing nutritional information (calories, fat content) promotes responsible pet ownership. Some establishments even offer ""healthy"" pup cup options with reduced fat content or added probiotics.

Key features of the pup cup include:

* Simple ingredient list
* Small portion size
* Palatable flavor (dogs generally like it; appealing texture)
* Readily sourced pretty much anywhere that sells coffee

## Core Benefits

The pup cup's popularity stems from its numerous benefits, both for dogs and their owners.

**Enhanced Socialization and Bonding**

Sharing a pup cup creates a positive and memorable experience for both the dog and its owner. It provides an chance for socialization in public spaces like coffee shops and parks, strengthening the bond between pet and owner. The act of offering a treat reinforces positive behavior and creates a sense of trust and affection.

**Positive Reinforcement and Training Aid**

The pup cup can be used as a high-value reward during training sessions. Its novelty and deliciousness make it a highly effective motivator for dogs, encouraging them to learn new commands and behaviors. The small size allows for frequent use without overfeeding, making it a practical tool for positive reinforcement training.

**Increased Emotional Well-being for Dogs**

The simple joy of enjoying a appetizing treat can significantly improve a dog's emotional well-being. Pup cups provide a moment of sensory pleasure and excitement, contributing to a happier and more relaxed state. The act of giving a pup cup can also alleviate boredom and provide mental stimulation,especially for dogs that spend a lot of time indoors.

**Business Benefits for Coffee Shops/Establishments**

offering pup cups attracts dog owners to businesses, increasing foot traffic and revenue. It creates a pet-friendly atmosphere, fostering positive brand associations. The pup cup also serves as a highly shareable marketing tool,as owners often post photos and videos of their dogs enjoying the treat on social media,generating free advertising.

## FAQs Section

**Are pup cups safe for all dogs?**
While pup cups are generally safe for most dogs when given in moderation, it's essential to consider individual dietary needs and health conditions. Dogs with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies should avoid traditional whipped cream pup cups and opt for dairy-free alternatives. Puppies and dogs with sensitive stomachs may require smaller portions. Always consult with your veterinarian if you have concerns about your dog's suitability for pup cups.

**How frequently enough can I give my dog a pup cup?**
Pup cups should be considered occasional treats, not a regular part of your dog's diet. The frequency depends on your dog's size, activity level, and overall health. A small pup cup onc or twice a week is generally acceptable for most adult dogs. Avoid giving pup cups daily, as the high fat and sugar content can contribute to weight gain and other health problems.

**Can I make pup cups at home?**
Yes, making pup cups at home is a simple and cost-effective way to control the ingredients and portion sizes. Use heavy cream, coconut cream, or a dog-friendly yogurt as the base. Avoid adding sugar or artificial sweeteners. You can also add dog-friendly toppings like blueberries, peanut butter, or crushed dog biscuits. Homemade pup cups allow for greater customization and ensure that the treat is tailored to your dog's specific needs.

- **Portion Size:** Varies depending on the type of treat
- **Availability:** Widely available at pet stores and grocery stores
- **Price:** Varies depending on the brand and type of treat

Commercial dog treats offer more consistent nutritional value and specific health benefits but lack the freshness and customization potential of homemade treats. For owners prioritizing convenience and social experiences, the pup cup provides significant value despite its low nutritional content. Homemade treats provide the most control over ingredients and nutritional value but require more effort and planning.

I came across ads for a product called [Buck Naked](https://www.buckedup.com/shop/cutting-weight-management/buck-naked) by the [Bucked Up](https://www.buckedup.com/hp1) brand, which claims to boost metabolism and help burn fat. On the surface, it seems to be a concoction of stimulants. I know caffeine can suppress appetite and acts as a stimulant, which is why coffee sometimes helps for weight loss.

Has anyone here actually tried the supplement from the brand or Buck Naked specifically? Did it make any noticeable difference for you—energy, appetite, actual fat loss? Or is it more of a placebo/marketing thing?

1mb4u4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mb4u4k/downgloom/,"""Downgloom""","Late December. It's quite cold. The snowy weather outside the car continues throughout the night. The sparkling icy cold specks of ice fall from the skies above, with the moon nearly abstracted by the looming clouds.

The snow lands all around. And yet, sometimes, it never sticks forever. Always melting away before the next one comes to take its place on this floating space rock we all stand on.

I can't exactly describe how I felt at the moment. Driving endlessly through the cold, looking for my final destination through the snow, and being quite cold through it all. 

It is quite cold, indeed. Not just from the weather outside, but the very feeling I'm experiencing right now. 

I kept the heater running for as much as I possibly can, continuing to focus on the road ahead of me. No signs of anything or anyone around. The last thing I could say that I saw was only a couple of cars and an ambulance. But after that, there was nothing.

Just a straight empty road ahead of me.

It's bizarre, isn't it? Driving throughout this wintery, blue night, and yet, even within a warm car, it's always quite cold. But not just any kind of cold... a cold that sometimes never ceases to disappear. 

An hour would pass by as I would soon realize that my car was slowly running out of fuel. I looked around to see if there would be any kind of stop to try and fuel up.

Luckily, after going through a few horizons, I came across a little convenience store. With a gas station and everything. 

I pulled up to the place, looking at it with ease as I turned my car off. The sign above read, ""HIGH 5,"" in bright neon blue. Surprisingly, the place was still open, with the open sign still on. 

I took a deep breath as I got out of the car and into the cold, winter night. I held my coat tightly, seemingly trying to keep all of my body warmth from exiting into the cold night air. It was quite cold.

I walked into the convenience store, still quite cold, and made my way towards the hot coffee area to try and warm myself up a bit. 

As I was pouring hot coffee for myself, I began to feel the cold sensation of...  worry. Something seemed off at first, and I wasn't exactly paying much attention to realize that there was nobody around.

Not even a store clerk in sight. 

I looked around, calling for anybody to see if they were still here to try and have the pump for gas open for me. But no matter how much I searched, the convenience store was completely dead.

And I soon began to feel cold again. Quite cold, actually. I think it was a breeze from the weather outside that made its way inside, but even then, those front doors were shut tight. 

The feeling of unease began to fill me to the brim, as I made my way around the counter to try and release the pump for myself, but when I went around to do so, I saw a bunch of coffee cups all over the floor behind the counter. 

I thought to myself how utterly disgusting that was. Maybe whoever was working the night shift just didn't bother to clean themselves up before leaving. 

But even with that thought, I was still unsure. I clenched my coat close. It was still so, so cold. The lights above began to flicker on and off. I quickly ran out of the store, accidentally dropping my cup of coffee.

I quickly got into my car, continuing to try and warm myself up. My heart raced with large echoes of beats pounding against my chest. It was quite cold.

I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down in the car. As I opened my eyes back up and looked out into the snowfall outside, I noticed that the High 5 outside had completely vanished.

And even stranger, my fuel meter was at a maximum full tank. 

""What the fuck?"", I thought to myself.

That's when I began to have this... weird feeling. This... bizarre, cold feeling inside of me. As I began to drive off, I kept thinking to myself that something was following me.

Or maybe it was some... idea. Some kind of... truth.

I kept thinking about the cars I saw earlier during my drive. That cold feeling grew. But it was... different. A different kind of cold. A cold that I couldn't even describe in words that would come out of my own mouth, with heated breaths appearing in thin air. 

It would soon turn to an hour and a half.

I kept trying to find a hotel. A place where I could sleep for the night.

But I would never find one. No hotel, no gas stop, no parking lot, absolutely nothing. As I made a stop. And I got out of my car, into the cold night. With in front of me, a bunch of cars were parked.

Many people gathered in large chunks. Heated breaths filled the air, and distress was present alongside the huddling of much needed warmth. 

An ambulance car was there. And they were carrying away someone in the back of their car. They looked so pale. So frozen over. So cold.

My head began to hurt. I turned back to my car, as my head began to hurt more and more, like a large needle was poking at my brain that stung my eyeballs. And when I looked back... complete emptiness.

No cars. No ambulance. No people. Just me, my car, and the dark road ahead of me. I got into my car, still seeing that my fuel was still at 100. 

I began to slowly drive, while looking at my window to the car that was stuck in the snow. And that's when I realized.

That cold, downglooming feeling loomed over me. It was something I was running away from in seek of warmth. But would never find in the long run.

And that's when I remembered, as I kept on driving through the never-ending valley of a never-ending season of coldness. It was the last thing I could really remember. 

The windshield was covered in white.

Icy specks fell more and more.

And I had finally gotten to my final destination.

It's quite cold.

I wasn’t searching for love, validation, or even connection. But somehow, we clicked. There was chemistry between us, the kind that just flows without effort. He made me laugh, he seemed genuine, and for a while, I really thought something meaningful could come from it.

From the beginning, he told me he doesn’t stay friends with exes. I was okay with that. I trusted him. I wasn’t the jealous type, and I believed that if someone gives you no reason to doubt them, you return the same trust.

But then his ex came back into the picture. Slowly, then more boldly. After she saw us together at a coffee shop, she suddenly had things she needed him to pick up, wanted help editing a video, invited him to brunch. It felt disrespectful. Not just her presence, but his lack of clear boundaries. When I brought it up, he got distant, like I was overreacting. And that confused me even more. It almost felt like he mentioned her just to see if I’d get jealous, and then when I finally reacted, he dropped the whole thing.

Still, I gave him grace. Again and again. I made an effort. I was kind. I didn’t do those things because I was desperate, I did them because that’s who I am. But over time, I started realizing I was doing all the emotional work. I’d spend time overthinking tiny arguments, wondering if he was still mad or if I had gone too far. He never reassured me. He never showed up emotionally the way I needed. I was carrying the weight of the relationship alone.

I communicated clearly. I told him what wasn’t working, what I needed to feel safe and valued. And every time, he told me I was right. He promised to change. But nothing ever did.

One of the final straws was when I told him that things between us didn’t feel good anymore. That we were losing something, and that I needed effort real effort. Instead of showing up, he left me on delivered for hours. Twice. That silence felt like a slap. So I made a decision: if he truly wanted to reach me, he’d call. I was done being the one who responded immediately while he took his time. I was done being emotionally available to someone who only showed up when it was convenient.

So I stopped replying to his texts. And a day later, he resent a message asking where I was. I still didn’t answer not because I was playing games, but because I’d decided: if he genuinely cared, he’d pick up the phone and call. He never did.

And that was the moment I realized the effort had always come from me. In the beginning, he made time, he made effort, he pursued me. But slowly, that faded. I had to ask for what used to be given freely. And that’s when I ghosted him( not out of immaturity, but out of clarity). Out of the exhaustion that comes from being in a relationship where your needs are always ""something to fix later"" and never something that’s actually prioritized.

And the thing is, I don’t regret being kind. I don’t regret giving him chances. Because now I know, with full certainty, that I did everything I could. I showed up. No one can say I didn’t try. Not even him.

But here's the part that still sits heavy with me: I don’t know if he ever liked me for me, or if he just liked the idea of me. People often say I’m “wifey material,” someone anyone would be lucky to have. Maybe he felt that too but not because he truly saw me, just because he didn’t want to miss out on something that looked good on the surface. I think he liked how I looked, maybe even my personality at first. But deep down, I think he liked the version of me that served his ego, not the full version that needed care and reciprocity.

Eventually, the silence started. Four days of nothing. And during that time, I kept wondering, ""Am I still in a relationship, or am I single now?"" It was like being stuck in limbo emotionally abandoned but technically still “his.” And then I heard from a friend (the same one who introduced us) after a month and 1 half of no contact that he told her I was the one who ignored him. That broke me a little. He rewrote the story. He erased everything I did and flipped the narrative to protect his pride. It made me feel invisible.

And here’s the truth I hate admitting: a part of me still wants him to come back crawling. I want him to feel what it’s like to lose someone who made love easy. I want him to regret taking me for granted. I want him to remember the softness I gave him and realize that it wasn’t common, it wasn’t average, and it won’t come again.

At the same time, if he ever did come back, a part of me would still want to greet him with kindness. Not because he deserves it, but because that’s who I am. I want him to remember what it felt like to be treated with grace and if that memory haunts him, so be it.

I’ve realized I don’t need closure or revenge. I don’t even need answers. What I need is peace. And peace, for me, is knowing I loved fully and walked away when that love was no longer being honored.",1,1753670486.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

1mb4onw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mb4onw/all_in_good_time/,All in good time?,"Hi 👋 
So I’m 35f and I’ve recently just got back into the dating scene. Every relationship I’ve ever been in has been abusive to some degree but I’ve been working on myself and healing and felt ready to explore what is out there.
I’ve been talking to a guy (32) for about a month and we met up for a little coffee date. It went really well. He was respectful, understanding, kind and warm. He asked for my permission before kissing me (due to my SA experiences, I greatly appreciated this). The kiss was good, nice, slow and he didn’t try to slip me the tongue either. We’ve continued talking ever since and things are going really well (we have a dinner date this week). But, there’s no electricity for me(?) on a soul level I feel very comfortable and safe and happy but I’m struggling a bit with physical and sexual attraction. Will this part of the attraction come with time? Is it because I’m still healing from my traumas that that part of me is seeking the ‘high’ of toxic behaviours from a partner?

Any advice/thoughts would be very much appreciated ☺️",2,1753670148.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1mb4nzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mb4nzo/aio_is_this_as_creepy_as_it_feels/,AIO? Is this as creepy as it feels?,"Never thought I’d be writing something like this. First, I’m fully aware I need to be more direct and firm with my boundaries, but I, like an idiot, thought this would eventually blow over. I’m here to rant, to ask for perspective, and to learn what you all think I should do to confront this situation, please. 

I take public transit to and from work. Back in January, a man I’d seen on my route for about a year asked when the bus was coming. This was the time we ever spoke. We got on the bus, and as I sat down, he asked if he could sit with me—then just did. He’s twice my size, so I was crammed into the window seat. He gave off that overly friendly, airhead vibe—jumping from random topic to topic and asking me many questions about myself. I gathered he’s mid-30s. I’m 24.

At one point, he grabbed my hand and said I was cold, then tried to warm it up. He asked if I was married while touching my ring. I said no (regret that now). Then he grabbed my nails and asked if they were real. Yeah. I pulled my hands back and shoved them into my pockets.

Again, this was the *first time* meeting this guy. Just before my stop, he hesitated and asked if he could come over. I laughed and said, “No? I met you 15 minutes ago. I live at home with my family.” He just said “Oh, they’d mind?” I didn’t even respond, he fist-bumped me (?) and I walked off.

Two times after that, he’d ask if I was cold while gesturing to my hands in my pockets—like he wanted to “warm them up” again. Fuck’s sake. A week later he asked for my number. After a 12-hour shift, tired, I said, “Sure, I guess. But I don’t really text.” I know giving it likely gave the wrong impression. In the moment I thought it was the fastest way to be left alone. I found his full name and online profiles from his number though, just so I’d know *who* this guy is. He’s only ever texted me twice since January, thankfully— and I’ve never texted back. 

Since the first time speaking, every time he sees me, he tries to sit with me and chat. I don’t let him anymore. I keep my bag in the seat next to me. He always nudges my shoulder when he sees me, which I hate. I just want to read and listen to music omw to and from work, but he constantly tries to keep conversation, tells me he wishes we could hang out, asks if he can come over, or if I’ll come to his place. He’s tried asking me out subtly, but I tell him I work a lot (I do) and *I’m not interested.*

Now, months later, I’ve been fully avoiding him—no eye contact, walking ahead, headphones in—but he doesn’t get the hint, even when I *say* I’m not interested in talking. I sit on the bus with headphones in, reading, and he’ll twiddle his thumbs while staring at me, even lean forward and wave to get my attention. I ignore it. He knows where I work, since he walks in the same direction to get to the gym, and he knows what stop I get off at to go home. 

When I get off to go to work, he is *always* off the bus waiting for me, or catching up to me. The other day, I ignored him after we got off the bus and he caught up to me, and *pulled my earphone out* to get my attention. “Can you hear me?” I stopped him immediately and put it back in my ear. I gave a pissed-off laugh and said, “Yes. I can hear you. I’m going this way,” and turned a sharp left towards a parking lot, the route I take to head to a coffee shop nearby. 

The other day, as usual, I saw him waiting as I got off the bus, so I walked the complete opposite direction to avoid him. I’ve never gone this way before, but I *really* wasn’t in the mood to talk. I walked two blocks, turned a corner, and who pops up behind me? Yep. He was following me. I subtly jumped—I wasn’t expecting someone behind me. He laughed, waved to get my attention, and asked if I was avoiding him. I said I was tired and not in the mood to talk. He said, “Oh? You’re disappointed to see me?” in this clueless, cheerful tone. I just laughed. Didn’t even deny it. Then he asked where I went the other day. I lied and said I forgot, and he said, “Were you getting coffee?” How would you know that? I just said, “Yeah, idk.”

I’m pissed at myself for not noticing I was being followed. Lesson learnt. I genuinely didn’t think he’d do that. Cause yk, read the room?

He walked with me to work, as he *always does* (and he can’t get in, it’s key access only), and said I reminded him of his ex. I reply, “Huh. Life.” Lol. Then he said, “I wish we could spend more time together… but I guess you’ve got a groove going.” I gave a half-assed laugh and said, “Yeah… see ya,” and walked in.

I know I need to say, “Look man, fuck off,” but this has escalated so quickly. It went from some guy trying to chat me up, to him stopping me in my tracks to get my attention and following me. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before. I tend to fawn in uncomfortable situations—laugh it off and politely decline—and now it’s biting me in the ass six months later.

Despite him knowing my stop and where I work, do I still tell him directly to leave me alone? I honestly thought he’d get the hint—like… months ago.",2,1753670088.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Like, the instructors literally said that it's always the students that work that struggle the most in their classes. I'm not sure if they're doing that as a scare tactic or something. As a speech language pathologist, you have to know your stuff. You have to be on it. Thing is, my family and I have been talking and they say that it's just better for me to have my own money. They say that try continue to work now. I work at a coffee shop. So maybe I only work on weekends. Even so, my job requires me to work at least 12 hours a week.

I'm kind of scared, because I know how busy it'll be. Class for 4-5 days. Then work for 2-3 days. I'm going to be busy. But at the same time, I want to keep working. I've bene working for 4 years now, and it'll be an uncomfortable adjustment not having my own money anymore.

1mb4krz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mb4krz/ex_cheated_we_stayed_friends_i_accidentally/,"Ex cheated, we stayed friends. I accidentally hooked up with her best friend while blackout drunk. Now everything’s a mess.","I (27F) and my ex, Ruby (26F), are still good friends. We were together for almost five years, and she cheated on me during a five-month period of long-distance at the end of last year. The breakup was messy because we were genuinely in a happy, healthy relationship. We truly loved each other. We called every night while we were apart, and all our friends said we were that couple—the one people looked up to as an example of a great partnership.

In December, she met a woman (32F) through work—someone she told me about. Let’s call her Luna. I wasn’t the jealous type because I trusted her, especially since this woman was married to a man.

I came back to my country in mid-January and reunited with Ruby, but something felt off. She tried to act normal, but I could tell something was wrong. Out of nowhere, she asked for a “break,” saying she needed to readjust her life and routine now that I was back. It was strange, because before the long-distance period, we were inseparable. We saw each other almost every day, practically lived together, and brought each other everywhere. We were a unit.

I was so confused. It completely caught me off guard. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t believe in “breaks”—to me, it means the relationship is over. But being my hopeful, naive self, I said yes, thinking maybe we could still fix it.

By February, we already had plans to travel overseas for a concert. We booked everything in December, so canceling wasn’t an option. We went on the trip with Luna and her friend (29F). I already had suspicions, but I brushed them off—again, because Luna was married.

Long story short, I caught them cheating. We were drunk, and I saw their texts. To put it lightly, I exploded—but only at Ruby, not Luna. We officially broke up that night. It was a three-day trip, and that happened on day one.

Honestly, I’m proud of how I handled things afterward. The next morning, the three of us sat down and talked calmly. They apologized and explained, and I listened. I told them how I felt, wished them good luck, and even asked Luna to take care of Ruby—because I really loved her.

We still had two days left on the trip. And I was nice. I tried to seem as “okay” as possible. I genuinely befriended Luna—we talked, we laughed, we joked. Ruby looked even more stressed, probably because of how I was reacting. When I got back, my friends said I was insane for staying, let alone being civil.

Not gonna lie—it was hard. My heart felt so heavy. But I’m a firm believer that what’s meant for me will be mine. I gave her my best, and if that wasn’t enough, then maybe I’m not the one.

I felt completely lost. I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with Ruby. She wasn’t just my girlfriend—she was my best friend. I thought once I came back, everything would go back to normal. I was so excited to return, because those five months apart were brutal. I was alone in another country, missing milestones my ex and friends were experiencing without me. I missed home. But the “home” I pictured in my head had already started building itself somewhere else.

After that, I was a wreck. I drank almost every night, cried every day. I still stayed in touch with Ruby. We talked occasionally. I’m not going to pretend I don’t love or care about her anymore, but now it’s just in a different form.

Then came Damien (26M)—Ruby’s ex, best friend, and business partner. I was friends with him too, since they worked together and I often tagged along. They were very close: shared secrets, ran a brand together, had the same hobbies. I was never threatened by him—they only dated for about four months, two years before I came into the picture. He was always the third wheel in our relationship. I was friendly but not too close, partly because Ruby once told me he’d said I was pretty, and it made her jealous. She even told him not to “try anything funny” with me from the start. Ruby always had a sense that Damien liked me. So we both kept our distance. We were close in a group sense, not personally.

The breakup affected him too. Ruby distanced herself from almost everyone—most of our friends sided with me, including him. To be clear, I never asked anyone to choose sides. But people naturally comforted me more. Ruby and Damien’s work relationship suffered—projects were delayed, and she became more sensitive and defensive around him, making communication difficult. As a result, Damien and I got closer. We started hanging out almost every day—texting, drinking, venting. It was purely platonic. We were both grieving in our own way: I lost my girlfriend, and he lost his best friend.

He comforted me a lot. He’s the kind of guy who gives compliments freely. I was struggling with body image after gaining a lot of weight over the past two years. The stress of being abroad and the breakup brought me back to my old weight. He noticed, and often told me I looked more confident and pretty, that he was proud of me. Those words helped. I started taking better care of myself, and I got so many compliments from people—even strangers replying to my Instagram stories.

Two months into our new friendship dynamic, we were drinking at his place, just talking like usual. Then, out of nowhere, the sadness hit me again. I cried about the question that haunted me: “Why did she do that to me?” He said he didn’t understand either, and told me that if he were her, he would never have let someone like me go. He said spending more time with me made him realize how little he actually knew me before. He admitted that over those two months, he started to like me more than he expected. I didn’t know what to say. I knew that if Ruby ever found out, she’d be furious. I told him I didn’t feel the same way, but I understood.

After that, he started mentioning it more—buying me food, complimenting me more, making time to see me. I acknowledged it but never encouraged it. I never breadcrumbed him. For me, he was still just a platonic friend.

One night, after hanging out with friends, he drove me home. He was venting about how his friendship with Ruby was falling apart. We parked and kept talking. He cried and asked for a hug. I hugged him. But during the hug, he tried to put his hand inside my shirt and kissed me. I pushed him away and said no. He apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again, so we kept talking until he calmed down. Nothing else happened that night. But after that, he occasionally joked about sex or dating me.

Fast forward to July—I was in a better place. I wasn’t sad anymore. I only drank occasionally. I had a stable job. Ruby and Damien were slowly mending their friendship. The three of us even hung out a few times and things felt normal again.

Until last week.

We were working on a project at a bar, and we drank a lot. I blacked out almost completely. Ruby went home with Luna, and I went home with Damien—but we had a driver. Everything I know about that night comes from other people.

Before we left the bar, I was still talking, standing, helping load things—normal drunk behavior. In the car, Damien said I puked, so he gave me a plastic bag. At my apartment, I found my keys, drank water, and gathered my stuff. He said I puked again in the bathroom, and when he tried to help me to bed, I refused and asked for clean clothes. He gave me some and went to the bathroom. When he came out, I was still sitting, saying I couldn’t change. He helped me again, but we both fell onto the daybed. I landed on top of him. He said I didn’t want to move and told him to stay. Then, according to him, I asked him to sleep with me.

He said he was shocked and asked me several times if I was sure, and I kept saying yes. He said we talked and joked during it. I apparently laughed and said something like, “If we were girls, this would last till morning.” I don’t remember any of this.

The next morning, I woke up naked in my bed—horrified. Damien was asleep on the daybed. I had a split-second flashback and panicked. I called Ruby and told her I thought something had happened. She immediately asked, “Was it Damien?” I said yes and told her I’d explain later.

On the way to work, Damien texted me like nothing had happened, asking how to lock up.

At work, I told Ruby everything. She was furious. She had told Damien to take care of me. She went to his house, yelled at him, punched his table, even threw her cap in frustration. Then she called me back to share what she said to him—but also told me she was disappointed in me for not taking care of myself.

Damien later texted me to apologize. He said he didn’t realize I was blacked out—that I seemed responsive, was speaking normally, and he genuinely thought it was consensual. He asked if he could explain in person, but I didn’t respond.

That day and the next, I had several panic attacks.

Eventually, I agreed to meet him at a coffee shop. He told me the whole timeline. I told him I felt sad and taken advantage of, even if it wasn’t intentional. But I also acknowledged that I shouldn’t have let myself get that drunk. He took full responsibility and apologized again. The panic attacks eased after that.

The next day, I met up with Ruby and her friend Lily (26F), who’s also my friend—but I originally met her through Ruby. Turns out Ruby had already told Lily what happened, so we talked about it. I told Lily my side of the story, and I noticed Ruby looking visibly upset. After I finished, she said she didn’t understand why it upset her so much—when this should be my and Damien’s problem. I couldn’t help but think she felt a little jealous but couldn’t admit it—because she’s already with Luna now.

A few days later, Damien asked me to accompany him while he waited for a project launch. Ruby still wasn’t speaking to him. I went. We talked like usual and avoided the topic. I tried to mentally file that night away as just a hookup, but it’s hard. I’ve never had a hookup before, let alone with a man. And all I remember is a flash.

Now I’m scared this will be the final nail in the coffin for their friendship and their brand. I don’t want that. I watched them build it from the ground up. I helped build it. And now, this situation—it just breaks my heart.

I’m up at 6:30, racing to get my kid to school, make breakfast, and log into work by 8. It’s a blur of spilled cereal, lost backpacks, and last-minute Zoom checks. Then I added a few smart home tools—and everything shifted. 

Here’s the setup: At 6:25, my smart blinds open slowly, letting in natural light to wake us up gently (no more blaring alarms). By 6:30, the coffee maker starts—no more forgetting to hit “on” the night before. While I’m in the shower, I ask my smart speaker to list my kid’s homework (saved in a shared app) so I can nudge them to grab it.  

The best part? The “school run” trigger. When I say, “Let’s go!” the lights turn off, the thermostat adjusts, and the front door unlocks—all at once. No more running back for the keys or worrying if I left the heat on.  

It’s not perfect. Last week, the speaker misheard “Let’s go” as “Let’s bake” and turned on the oven. Cue panic as we smelled burning toast while grabbing shoes. But even that mishap made us laugh later.  

Do you use smart home tech to streamline busy routines? What’s your most useful “life hack” setup? I’d love to steal some ideas—my mornings could still use more calm!",1,1753669549.0,HomeAutomateJoy,0,1.0,False

I made a post earlier. It wasn't nice. I apologize. I remember the first time you said you hated me. It cut really deep. You said it a few times and it's just replaying in my head. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for making you feel like i was using you. In the end I felt we had drifted so far apart. I didn't know how to reset everything. I didn't know how to move on. I'm sorry for using you for hoots. I'm sorry for using you for sex, and not even doing that right. 

I'm sorry about our little family and the absolute chaotic mess it turned into. I'm sorry that I've made you feel guilty for not seeing Z. When you didn't show up I didn't care what your reasoning was. It was like the first day of becoming a single mom again. It hurt so bad. 

I remember sitting on the couch with you  you had relapsed. Shortly after Z was born. I broke down and told you I didn't want to do this alone again. I couldn't do this alone again. You promised... you fucking promised you weren't going anywhere.

I'm sorry for relapsing. I'm sorry for calling my mom to come help. We should have flushed it. I'm sorry I didn't have enough self control to stop the day he was apprehended. I needed you. I couldn't breathe. Everything hurt so bad. We didn't even get to say good bye. I'm sorry that I've let a drug ruin us, our baby, my 2 beautiful girls. 

Before I go on. I seen them today. They were beside our place, walking through the parking lot. I couldn't run up and scoop them up. I had to watch them walk away. I can't even begin to explain how devastating that was. All I want is a hug from them and you.

I'm sorry that I'm so broken. I'm sorry I haven't worked on it. I'm sorry you had to deal with it. I'm sorry I ruined your mental health. I'm sorry I made us sad.

I'm sorry I didn't make you feel wanted. Truth is. I forgot how to want anything besides drugs. I'm so sorry I didn't express this to you. I know you would have helped, but I didn't want to ask again. I didn't want my mental health to burden you 

I'm sorry for not trusting you after you were honest with me. I became a bitter, hollow, shell of the person I used to be. It hurt when you didn't come home, all u
I wanted was a hug. I'm sorry you had had deal with it. I'm sorry you had to watch me and our relationship turn into hatred. Anger. Any bad emotion you can think of. 

I'm sorry I didn't do the little things. God I miss the little things. Remember when i told you my ex said bringing me coffee in bed was ""gay shit"" so you started doing it the next morning. 

I miss you. This apartment feels like a cold place. So many memories in such a short time. I miss Z. I miss my girls. We were so close. So close. But self sabotage is a bitch. I knew we were going to break. I knew it. When we brought Z home, it felt too perfect. You were such an amazing dad. I didn't ever expect that honestly. It was my favorite look I've ever seen on you. 

I was looking at pictures today. I watched our smiles slowly fade over the last year. But do you remember when we took the girls for dinner? You have the biggest smile. We were happy. I want to feel that again. 

The pictures of you and Z kill me. Again. You looked so happy. So comforted. He's hit a couple milestones... I hurt not having your hugs. Your comforting words. I really hope we can be a happy family. 

I'm sorry for breaking your trust. I wanted to hurt you. I wanted you to feel the pain I felt. That's why I waited for months. It was the wrong decision. I know that. And I'm sorry. I love you so much. I'm sorry for breaking you. That was never my intentions, I forgot how to love. I forgot how to care. The crack didn't kill me. It just killed every part of me that felt anything.

I couldn't figure out how to love again. I couldn't figure out how to feel. Even when the hoots ran out. I was so angry. I acted like it was your fault. Im so sorry. I wish I could back to those moments and just cuddle you. I'm sorry that making up became angry sex and going to sleep. Usually without cuddles. I'm so sorry.

I miss sober us. Dear God I really miss sober us. Or at least sober me. We were much better at communicating. I hate thinking back to the first fight we had after I was in active addiction. I remember it so clearly. The rage we both felt. The anger on our faces. I hate that our fights became so frequent. I hate every moment spent throwing our pasts in each other's faces. I'm sorry for every slammed door. Raised voices. Yelling in rage. God i wish I had just hugged you more.

Thank you for being there, when you really didn't have to be. Thank you for being there for me and Z. Thank you for being his dad. Thank you for showing me love and patience, even when I didn't deserve it. Thank you for being an amazing. Kind. Caring. Human. Your heart is so big, I'm genuinely in awe of what a beautiful human you are. I strive to care about people as much as you do. You really are perfect. 

Thank you for teaching me that I deserved love. Thank you for teaching me that I'm more than my past. Thank you for teaching me that gentle humans fo exist. Most of all though, thank you for being my safe space, the only safe space I've ever had. 

I really do love you B. I know you don't believe me. But I'd give anything to have you walk through that door and squish me with your love. I love you more than Winnie the Pooh loves honey.

I think that I would, I think I would tell you, Octavia
'I'm not sure what's going on
But I think I can help you'

I would have promised you, if I could then I would
Spend every night and day with you
I really would
If it'd mean that you won't be leaving

I would have told you stories just to keep you awake
If you felt like you were getting tired of living
Just to hold on
Before you go away sleeping

But me you did not call
To me you did not write
The letter you left behind, that night
To say you were leaving

I know that I barely know you
And the time that we've spent hasn't been very long,

1mb4ctz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mb4ctz/married_with_kids_and_so_tired_of_being_with_a/,Married with kids and so tired of being with a workaholic. What can I change in myself to better deal with it for now...,"I'm feeling very sad and disppointed right now. I asked my husband of 20 years if he would be willing to go to our rental property today to blow the pine needles off the roof before the new tenants get the keys Thursday. He didn't really want to so I told him I'd just hire someone to do it. He didn't want to spend the money, so he went this morning. It seemed to me that he's been angry at me all day so I just asked him if he is mad that I asked him to go to the rental property. He said he is. He is mad that ""When you have work you need help with you can ask me. But when I have work I need help with, I can't ask you.""

To clear up some things. I manage the rental property myself. I find the tenants, communicate with the tenants, do all the billing,, etc. I do a lot of maintenance stuff that I can do myself to save costs. I trimmed trees last week, I cleared up overgrown paths, I took some stuff apart and threw it away. I found someone to take a furniture item that last tenants left behind. I also rent out a parking spot on the property and handle all of that. Communication, meeting up with people to show them the space, etc. I do hire out to do move out cleanings and any larger repairs at the rental property since that is not my forte.

I also manage all investments, all bills, all education, all healthcare appointments for my children and myself. I do most of the food shopping though my kids are old enough I don't really cook much for them anymore. I manage the kids calenders. I am the primary driver for the kids. Unless I have a conflict and would have trouble picking up the kids from somewhere, he never handles the driving. We have two teenagers, 2.5 years apart, who I have been the primary caretaker for. I have homeschooled them, now homeschooled through a charter. For years, and still now, I've driven them to playdates, classes, extracurricular activities, friends' houses, school, to their jobs, etc. When they were involved in a competative sport, I would drive them to their monthly competitions, sometimes even a plane ride away. He never attended any of it and if it were up to him, they just wouldn't have gone to any of them.

On his side, he is a workaholic. He works from when he wakes up at 5:30am, until he goes to bed around 10:30 - 11:30pm. He also works all weekend, though since he's been going to therapy for a year, he also does some projects for himself on weekends in between hours of working. He is a salaried employee so he doesn't get paid more for working more. And yes, this is all one job he is working all these hours for. He does help with dishes (I load the dishwasher and he empties) and for the past few months he handles most of the laundry.

I've tried to help financially in the past. Whenever he'd ask me to read a book or take a class, I did. I've started two online businessses that failed. I tried studying to become an Amazon seller. I currently work part-time as a brand ambassador and I am now an actor. Not all my acting jobs have been paid as of now, since I only took my first acting class 2 years ago this month and a part of acting is working to build up working experience and a demo reel. But in those 2 years I went from never having acted before to having worked on 27 sets. Short films, commercials, modeling gigs, feature legnth films, and currently prepping for my first lead role in an indie feature. Basically, I'm not sitting around. I know how priviliged I am that I can pursue acting as a career becuase I don't have to worry about finances while he is working.

I have in the past tried to ""save"" him. When the kids were little and he wanted to be an author, I encouraged him and did a lot of research for him since he worked so much. When he couldn't find an agent, I suggested he self-publish. So he started writing. He worked a little bit less when the kids were little but when he would come home from work and on weekends I would keep them away from him so he could spend time writing. (Which of course made me the bad guys to the kids.) When he was done with each book, I would do a proofread then be in contact with an editor. I hired out the cover creation and formatting. I read and studied publishing and marketing books. I created his website. I gave him ideas for an email funnel and what he shuold write newletters about. After a few years and 6 books later, when he wasn't making any money, I told him that I couldn't keep carrying this dream for him. That it was his dream to be an author so I needed him to take the reigns and do the marketing. Instead he gave up and still resents me to this day for that.

At one point we had an idea to move to a different state, buy a property with two homes on it, so we could have less expenses and he could quit his crazy job. My kids and I gave up a lot of stuff, I did tons of research and the kids and I were ready to give up the life we knew for him. Last minute he decided he couldn't move unless he had guaranteed income before he moved. To this day I don't understand what he thought was going to happen. That I could somehow magically get him or I a job, at this new place ahead of time. Why would he let us believe he was onboard until the last minute?

Then this week, I had a discussion with him about what we were willing to do to make our expenses lower so he could find a way to not have to work so much. I told him I'm willing to sell the house so he can pursue his dreams (he wants to move to Europe.) I researched and sent him links to look for consulting jobs. I'm not willing to follow him anymore, but I am willing to take up more of the financial burden. I'm willing to sell the house, I'm willing to move into a smaller place with the boys, I'm willing to find consulting work for myself in addition to all the kid duties, and continue to make more money acting as I acquire more experience. But he says he refuses to work consulting becasue he won't quit without gaurenteed monthly income. And then there is this bit of resentment that comes up in him that he ""has to kill himself"" to support us. When there is not one person in that entire company that works as much as he does. He created this scenario.

And this morning, he's mad at me all day because he had to spend time at the rental doing a job that is supposed to be my job (managing the rental.) I'm so tired of this. Of this martyr story he always carries around with him, even if it only actually surfaces sometimes. I'm so tired of being subtly blamed for his workaholism, when I have nothing to do with his choices. And I have foolishly spent many hours, weeks and years trying to support him by finding a different way to make money. 

To this day, I feel guilty if I am not busy and working on evenings and weekends because he is and he has made me feel bad about it in the past. So besides picking up one child from a friends house today and spending some time doing a puzzle with the other, I have spent my Sunday on the computer. Working on my latest role, on rental property tasks, paying bills etc.

My favorite places to buy clothes for the boys and I are at thrift shops and discount stores, I don't buy designer shoes, clothes or purses. We only eat out about once every few months. I go out and get coffee about once a week, mostly when I have driven a child to an activity that it makes more sense for me to wait for them rather than go back home and back out. I am NOT a high maintenance woman at all.

I'm tired. I don't want to walk out of the marriage at this point. Like so many other women, I stay for the kids. And even though I am super busy with everything I still have the freedom to pursue acting because of his job. I am grateful for that. And yes, I have let him know that. But, I just feel so empty, so unloved, so hollow when he makes comments like ""It's not fair that when you need help you can ask me and when I need help you can't help me."" 

I don't even know what my question is but I know I find some amazing advice givers on other posts. Do I just need to stop letting myself get so upset when he shows his true colors? I am choosing to stay so maybe I just need to deal with it? Anyone been through something similar and can give advice? I can't change him, what can I work on myself to help me deal with this? 

Oh in case anyone asks, when I ask him to help with stuff he often will agree but sounds frustrated or just tells me he can't because he has work to do. And we did do couples therapy for awhile where I told him if things didn't change I don't think I would stay once the kids had grown, but he kept having scheduling conflicts with work, so I just kind of gave up on that. Thoughts?

My husband's younger sister has always asked us for money. Not once in a while. I mean constantly. Rent. Groceries. School stuff. Hair. Makeup. Nights out. Whatever it is, there’s always a reason. At first, I was okay helping out. I get it. She’s single, part time job, trying to figure things out. Fine. But it started becoming a pattern. Like clockwork, she’d text or call asking for something. And it was never just “Can I borrow?” it was “I need this now,” like we were her personal bank. The thing is, we have a kid. We’re not rich. We budget. We skip stuff. I coupon like crazy. We’re doing the best we can. So yeah, sometimes I say no. I’ve started saying it more often, actually. Especially when it’s stuff that feels... optional. Like new shoes she doesn’t need or a weekend trip with friends. This week, she called me while I was literally trying to put my son down for a nap. I let it go to voicemail. She called again. Then texted. I finally pick up and she goes, “I need 5k by tonight, I’m short on rent.” No “hi,” no “can I please,” nothing. Just demand. I told her, calm but firm, “Sorry, I really can’t. I’ve got bills and my son’s school coming up. We don’t have anything extra right now.” She went off. Said I was selfish. Said I “forgot where I came from.” Said if it was my own family, I wouldn’t hesitate. She brought up how she once paid for my coffee three years ago?. It got nasty. 

She hung up on me. Then my husband comes home and is weird with me. Apparently she called him crying and now he feels bad. He didn’t say I was wrong, but he did that quiet guilt trip thing like, “she just doesn’t have anyone else,” and “she’s struggling more than we are.” And now I’m the bad guy. Again. But I don’t think I did anything wrong? I have my own kid to think about. I'm already stretched thin. Why is it my job to always cover her? So yeah... Aitah?",4,1753669091.0,AITAH,24,1.0,False

1mb4axc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mb4axc/the_dahlia_well/,The Dahlia Well,"This is my first story that I’ve ever shared. Criticism and feedback is always welcome. I’ve spent a lot of time and a lot of thought into this story. If you do happen to read this let me know what you think! Thank you so much to both papa meat and goony boy for creating an amazing podcast, and all of you guys that create this fandom.  


Part I
   I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth. We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since. Lately though—because of everything that’s happened—I’ve been looking back on these early days a little less fondly. 
     Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse.
After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.
It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well. 
The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.
      “Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”
 I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole. The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.
     “Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards. “I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.” 
     “The well is beautiful?”
     “Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused. “You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”
     “Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I believed it myself. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well. “Is there anything down there?” 
     “Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole. “What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled. “Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.
     We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable. The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand. 
     When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle. My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.
     That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body. 
     I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.
    I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.
     
Part II
     I opened my windotw, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.
     When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon. 
     Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?
     As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast. I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door. 
     The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said.
I forced a smile as I started drying off.
“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.”
Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable.
“You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”
     “I can’t. It’s sentimental.”
     “Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that,” Seth added.
     “She offered soup. I said no.”
     “Dude. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”
     “Maybe.” He raised an eyebrow.
     “Maybe?” I shrugged.
     “I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”
     “Nightmares?”I hesitated.
     “Sort of.”
     “About the well that freaked you out?”
     “About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller. 
     “Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered. I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone. 
     One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs.
But something was off.
The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled.
And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.
I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”
     “Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”
     “You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.
     “What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.
     “You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.
     “What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”
     “I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.
     “No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them? 
     “I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended. “The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him. “There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.
     “Okay… maybe you need to just-“
     “And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck. “You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?” I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took. “Maybe we shouldn’t go back there,” he added.
That’s when I stood up.
     “No. We have to.”
     “What?”
     “I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”
     “Dude—why?”
     “Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up. 
     “Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.
     “So what do I do?” I asked.
     “Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.
     “Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there.
Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why.
I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.
     When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter.
And there it was—on the first page:
“The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.
     “Hidden deep in Pinewood Forest sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling. “Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”
     I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name. 
     I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough.
I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.
     I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:
     “Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well 
     “Constructed in 1885 by Harold Millen, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millen Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia Wren Millen, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines.
“According to local accounts, Dahlia Millen died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”
“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”
     I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

Part III
     I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well.
I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.
     The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.
     People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way. 
     I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?
     When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.
     The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box. 
      Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material. Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.
     There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.
     

      14 August, 1872
Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish
Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford
To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive—
I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one… [section smudged] …by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for.
The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong.
The well is not haunted.
It is—
[ink warped and bled through; several lines illegible]
…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the sun’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly… [blotted] …behind my own.
It listens.
I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—[section torn] I am watched. I am used.
I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns.
[long horizontal crease; ink almost entirely faded]
…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits.
Do not trace its paths. Do not name it.
And above all—
[last line unreadable; torn completely away at the bottom of the page]
In dwindling faith,
Fr. Elias Grange

     I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.
     At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.
     And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.
     I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying.
When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.
     That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me.
“It’s waiting for you.”
     The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.
     I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong. There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth. A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.
     I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes. The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.
     Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly. I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.
     I began keeping field notes. Every incident had a time stamp. I noted what I saw, what I heard, where in the house it happened, and what I might’ve done to trigger it. Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”
     One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams. Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else. 
     The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times. There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.
     I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.
     But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.
     The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.
     When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.
     I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.
     That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.
“Why would you do that?” Then silence.
     But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against eachother 
     I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.
     The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

Part IIII
     I returned to the edge of the pine clearing just before dusk. The woods were quiet—too quiet. The usual buzzing of summer insects and rustling of small animals seemed to have stilled. I felt like I was being watched, and I suppose in a way I was, because Seth was already there, sitting on a fallen log with his arms crossed and an expression somewhere between worry and disappointment. He stood as I approached, and I could see that he’d been waiting a while. “You’re serious about this,” he said flatly, not even offering a greeting.
     I nodded, not slowing my step. “I have to go back. Everything leads here. I’ve seen the symbols, the vines, the way the cracks form in the house—they all converge. It’s not random. It’s real. I think it always was.” Seth stared at me for a long time, like he was waiting for a punchline that never came.
    “You hear yourself? You’re talking about cracks and vines like they mean something. Like they’re some kind of sign. You don’t think maybe you’re just... seeing what you want to see?”
     “It’s not what I want to see,” I snapped, more sharply than I intended. “Do you think I want to believe any of this? That I want to be haunted, sleepless, surrounded by symbols that keep growing every time I look away? You didn’t read the priest’s letter. You didn’t hear the voice. You didn’t see the flowers on your pillow at night.” Seth rubbed his face with both hands and let out a breath. 
     “Jesus. I thought this would pass. I thought maybe if you just let it sit, it’d fade out like a bad dream. But you’re only getting worse. This is a suicide mission.”
     “I’m not going to die,” I said. “Not if someone’s up here to help pull me out.” He looked away and shook his head, muttering something I couldn’t hear, then sighed.
     “Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I’m pulling you up. No arguments. No excuses.”
     “Agreed.” We walked to his house to grab some rope, not speaking much. There was tension in the air, the kind that didn’t come from fear but from resignation. I knew I couldn’t explain it well enough for him to understand. And he knew I wouldn’t be talked out of it. He fetched a long coil of sturdy rope from the garage, along with a flashlight and gloves. We each carried one end as we made our way back toward the clearing. The forest felt tighter this time, the trees leaning inward, the light dimming faster than it should have. We barely said a word the entire walk.
     At the well, we paused. The stones looked the same, but I could feel something else—like the very air around us had thickened. The birds had gone silent. Even the insects had stopped. Seth tied one end of the rope to a heavy branch nearby, anchoring it securely, then looked at me. “This is your last chance to not be a complete idiot,” he said. “You sure about this?” I tightened the straps on my backpack and took a breath.
     “Yeah. I need to know.” He tied the rope around my waist and gave it a few strong tugs, testing the tension.
     “I’ll be right here. If you shout, I’ll pull. If the rope jerks, I’ll pull. If you’re quiet for too long, I’m pulling.”
     “Understood.” I climbed onto the edge of the well and slowly began my descent. The rope held firm as I lowered myself hand-over-hand into the dark shaft. At first, it was just damp stone and the faint echo of my breathing. Seth’s voice drifted down after me.
    “You good?”
    “Yeah,” I called back. “About ten feet down.” The stones started to feel slick, and the smell hit me—moisture and rot, like wet meat left out in the sun. After another few feet, I saw small holes in the stone walls—perfectly round, about the size of golf balls. They were spaced irregularly, as if bored into the well after its construction.
    “I see holes,” I called up. “They weren’t in the old construction. Maybe... something bored through.” “Don’t start speculating down there,” Seth called. “Just keep track of where you are.”
     I nodded to myself and kept going. At around twenty feet, the stone gave way to something else—dark, reddish, and fibrous. It wasn’t just damp. It glistened. The texture shifted beneath my hands, pliable but firm, like hardened muscle. My flashlight beam caught threads of some kind of tissue running along the walls in spirals. The air got denser. Every breath was harder to take, like I was inhaling steam laced with copper and mildew.  
      “I think I hit the bottom,” I lied. “Going a little farther.”
      “Be careful.” Another five feet down, I saw a ring embedded into the wall—a full circle, maybe three feet across, made entirely of the same fleshy material. It pulsed, slow and steady, like the beat of a buried heart. And then I heard it. A sound like breathing—not mine, not wind—something deeper, heavier. Inhale. Exhale.
     I felt a gust of hot air from below. I jerked the rope. “Pull me up!” There was no response at first. Then the rope shifted, tightening. As I ascended, I passed the holes again, and something shot out—vines. Slick, fast, they darted from the holes and lashed toward my legs. I kicked hard, trying to swing out of the way, but more shot up from below. I screamed to Seth. “Vines! They’re coming! Pull faster!”
     I felt the rope jerk violently. Seth was pulling with everything he had. As I cleared the edge of the stone section, the vines thrashed and whipped, lashing at my boots and legs. I was nearly out when I saw Seth’s face at the top, strained with effort. “Come on! You’re almost—” he started, then screamed.
     A vine had wrapped around his ankle. He kicked at it, shouting as he lost his grip on the rope. I tried to grab his arm as I neared the top, but another vine coiled around his thigh and yanked. He fought, cursing, eyes wide with panic. I pulled at him, but there were too many—vines snaking from the well, wrapping his arms, his chest, dragging him toward the mouth. “Don’t let go!” I yelled, clutching him with both hands.
     His grip slipped. I tried to hold on. I tried. But he screamed my name as the vines yanked him into the dark, his voice echoing down the shaft before it was swallowed whole. And then there was nothing. Only my ragged breath and the faint creak of the rope swaying.
     I ran. I stumbled through the trees until my legs gave out and I collapsed against a moss-covered rock. I sobbed there for what felt like hours. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. My friend—my only real friend—was gone, because of me. Because I believed in something I didn’t understand. Because I thought I could face it.
     When I finally made it home, I climbed into my window and collapsed on my bed, still wearing the same dirt-streaked clothes, hands trembling. I didn’t sleep. I just stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.
     The police questioned me for days. I told them the truth, or at least a version of it. That we’d gone hiking, that Seth slipped. That I couldn’t reach him. They searched the woods, the well, everything. They found no signs of foul play. They found no signs of Seth.
     The case was ruled accidental. A tragic fall. Maybe a cover-up. Maybe they didn’t want to know the truth. Maybe they couldn’t. His family stopped speaking to me. Friends from school distanced themselves. I became a pariah. The boy who got his best friend killed. I told myself I’d never go back. That it was over. But it wasn’t.
     It’s been eight years. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve kept quiet. I’ve moved twice. I tried to live a normal life. But I never really escaped that clearing. That well. Not really. The guilt has followed me like a shadow I can’t outrun. I see Seth’s face in dreams. Sometimes I hear him screaming. Sometimes I see him staring from the bottom of the well, not screaming at all. Just watching.
     I’m going back. Not because I think I’ll survive it. Not because I believe I can stop it. I’m going back because I can’t live with what I did. Or what I didn’t do. Seth deserved better. And I think whatever’s down there knows that. Maybe it’s always known.",1,1753668963.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1mb4afi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asexual/comments/1mb4afi/recently_discovered_im_ace_now_what/,"Recently discovered I'm ace, now what?","At the ripe old age of 28, I just had a profound realization about myself. After years of identifying as gay (at least socially, I align more spiritually and politically with the term ""queer"") I have come to understand that I'm actually more of a homoromantic asexual than I am homosexual.

Even though it made a lot of sense in hindsight, I was actually quite shocked initially because I've had a lot of sexual partners over the years, but the truth is, sex has always felt like something I ""had"" to do than something I \*wanted\* to do. In fact, everytime I had sex I was either under the influence of alcohol or completely dissociated. I might have consented, but I was never fully present. I don't know if I even really enjoyed sex or tricked myself into thinking I did. But now I realize I've actually been traumatizing myself with every sexual encounter because for years I was walking around in a haze and feeling constantly foggy-headed/on autopilot and at first I thought i was experiencing symptoms of derealization/depersonalization or some undiagnosed mental disorder but now I've come to realize that my brain was protecting me from all the trauma I put my body through.

Sex was always transactional. I thought I needed to have sex to get a guy to like me or get him to ""stay"" but the irony is that even if I gave in and gave a guy what I thought he wanted, I rarely got what \*I\* wanted, which was companionship and intimacy and genuine connection. After a hookup, the guy would either ghost or only ever hit me up to have sex or trade nudes. And the cycle would repeat itself where I felt like I ""had"" to have sex or trade nudes in order to keep their interest or they'd get bored of me. Which would make me feel crummy because I knew I was smart and funny and kind and interesting and all these wonderful things but they didn't care. They only wanted my body. Not my mind, not my heart. They didn't actually like me for who I was as a person, but for what I could do for them. And I was willing to do anything, because I wanted to be liked.

And I take full responsibility for never saying no. Well that's not true. I did say no sometimes. But no never really means no when it comes to these men, because they don't really care about what you want. They'll give you the silent treatment or guilt trip you into giving them what \*they\* want. So even if I was uncomfortable, I always relented. And of course that would make me feel even crummier afterwards. Violated even. It felt like a self-betrayal. Like I let myself down. Especially since I was the one who put myself in those positions to begin with and I have no one to blame but myself, especially when it came to sexualizing myself. Or allowing myself to be objectified.

I will admit that there were times that I downplayed my intelligence (both emotional and intellectual) and put more emphasis on my sex appeal but all that did was attract the wrong crowd and send the wrong message and made me feel misunderstood, but only because I was misrepresenting and mischaracterizing myself. There were even times where I felt like I ""had"" to put out if a guy was nice to me or did me a kindness, such as paying for a meal or allowing me to spend the night at his place after a night out to the point where I started to believe that all I had to offer \*was\* my body, when that couldn't be further from the truth. The truth is, I am loveable. I am worth getting to know. And I can have a good time without taking my clothes off.

In fact, whenever I was aroused it was not because I was sexually attracted to someone per se, but more so because we were being emotionally vulnerable with each other. He was opening up and sharing things with me or I was opening up and sharing things with him. It was a physical reaction to me feeling seen, appreciated, understood. Which is all I've ever wanted. All I ever wanted was to love and be loved in return and I fear I conflated sex and love even though the two are mutually exclusive and have practically nothing to do with each other.

To be honest if I spent the rest of my life never having sex ever again I genuinely believe I would be perfectly content. Even if it meant being a side, not a top or a bottom or a verse, just a side, that would be fine with me too. I've had enough sex to last me a lifetime and there's nothing I want more than to read my books in peace, travel to beautiful places, go on long walks, see interesting sights, meet interesting people, drink hot coffee (preferably with a nice pastry), listen to great music and watch exciting films. It would be nice to share these moments with someone special of course but I enjoy my company enough to know that I'll be fine with or without them. I wouldn't even know where to find another homoromantic ace (I checked out acespace, not for me personally but I'm open to recs).

So yeah, I say all of this to say, I will be abstinent for the foreseeable future because I have zero interest in or desire to have sex rn (and dare I say, I don't think I ever did). In any case, I'm happy to be part of the community. Where's the garlic bread?",4,1753668924.0,Asexual,0,0.84,False

His voice sliced through the room like a whip.

I blinked, heat rising to my cheeks as every eye in the conference room swung to me. My hands trembled slightly around the coffee tray, but I held onto it like my life depended on it.

Luca Steele stood at the head of the long glass table, tall, lethal, and entirely too composed for a man who’d just been drenched in a splash of boiling cappuccino. Steam still rose from his tailored black suit, but his steel-gray eyes were colder than ice.

“You’ve worked for me for two years,” he said, each word slow, deliberate, laced with venom. “And you still manage to be a walking disaster. Fix it. Or quit.”

No one dared to breathe.

The coffee stain spread across the crisp white papers in front of him, slowly bleeding into confidential numbers and contract drafts worth millions. I scrambled forward, grabbing tissues from the tray, muttering apologies that sounded too small, too broken, too pathetic.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Steele—”

“Sorry doesn’t clean Armani.” He stepped back, brushing off his sleeve with visible disgust. “And what the *hell* are you wearing?”

I froze.

His eyes dragged over me. Every inch.

My oversized brown cardigan hung off my shoulders like a borrowed curtain. The faded blouse underneath clung to me awkwardly, a button missing near the collar. The olive-green skirt was too long, too wrinkled, and paired horribly with the scuffed, worn-out flats I’d owned since college.

My foundation was two shades too pale. My lipstick was crooked. The jet-black wig I wore hung limply around my face, uncombed and clearly fake. And the massive round sunglasses I wore indoors? That was the final punchline.

I was a caricature. And everyone knew it.

Chuckles rippled softly across the room.

“I’m not running a charity,” Luca said, cutting through the silence. “If you can’t show up looking like a professional, then don’t show up at all.”

He didn’t wait for a response. He turned his back and walked toward the screen, launching into a presentation like I hadn’t just been stripped of every ounce of dignity in front of ten high-ranking executives.

I stood there, cheeks burning, throat tight.

And then I turned and walked out.

I rarely go out, and I definitely don’t dress up often. But then… I fell down the rabbit hole of Hermès shawls. Specifically, the dreamy, oversized 140x140 cashmere blend ones. 😩✨

I saw one, and I was instantly enchanted—like, *take my money* enchanted. The colors, the drape, the understated elegance… it was giving quiet luxury in the loudest way possible. And while these aren’t 1:1s, let’s be real—no one’s going to be inspecting the weave under a microscope. They look and feel *absolutely divine* in person. Floaty. Cozy. Luxe. The kind of thing you throw on over pajamas and suddenly feel like an off-duty heiress.

I got mine from three different sellers (because I couldn’t stop at just one), and I wanted to share my thoughts in case anyone else is eyeing these beauties but unsure where to start.

Are they worth it? 1000% YES. Honestly, I didn’t expect to love them *this*much, especially since I don’t even have a reason to wear them most days. But these shawls? They make me feel *put together* even when I’m just padding around the house with a coffee and a to-do list I may or may not ignore. 😂

The cashmere blend is buttery soft, lightweight but warm, and the generous 140x140 size makes it feel more like a chic wearable blanket than just a scarf. You can wrap it, drape it, toss it over your shoulder dramatically while opening the door for a delivery—whatever vibe you’re going for, it delivers.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Atlanta Braves vs. Kansas City Royals: A Tale of Two Offenses (and Why the Braves Should Win)**

**Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Lowbrow Showdown**  
The Atlanta Braves (-178) enter this matchup as favorites, which translates to a **64% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s roughly the same chance your average office worker has of surviving a coffee addiction. The Kansas City Royals (+150) offer a **40% implied probability**, which is about the same chance your boss has of remembering your birthday.

Statistically, this is a clash of two punchless offenses. The Braves score **4.1 runs per game** (24th in MLB), while the Royals manage a paltry **3.5 runs per game** (29th). It’s like watching two chefs try to cook a five-course meal with only a toaster and a single egg. The Braves’ edge? They’re slightly less bad. Their .488 win rate as favorites suggests they’re marginally more reliable than a broken umbrella in a hurricane.

Pitching will decide this. The Braves’ **Spencer Strider** is a cyborg in a human suit, while the Royals’ **Richard Hill** sounds like a name plucked from a list of generic fantasy villains. Recent history? The Royals just beat Cleveland 4-1 behind Noah Cameron’s heroics, but Hill hasn’t inspired similar confidence. The Braves’ offense, for all its flaws, has **Michael Harris II** and **Marcell Ozuna** to poke holes in Hill’s game.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Recent Performances, and Why the Royals Should Fear This Game**  
The Royals’ recent win over Cleveland was a masterclass in small-ball theater: a bases-loaded escape, a two-homer game from **Maikel Garcia** (who’s hitting like a man who found a cheat code), and a bullpen that didn’t cough up the lead. But that game featured **Noah Cameron**, not Richard Hill. Hill? He’s the Kansas City version of “mystery meat”—you hope it’s steak, but it’s usually a sad imitation.

The Braves, meanwhile, are leaning on Strider, whose fastball looks like it was fired from a cannon aimed directly at batters’ hop

I bought a Fellow Opus grinder today and went through almost an entire bag of beans to try and dial everything in but had no luck. The grinder works great but the espresso machine stalls on anything finer than a 3.5 on the grinder. If I dose less (15g), a tiny amount comes through but is sour. I get flow at a 4 but then it’s a bit too fast and that is way too coarse as far as I know and the shot still tastes sour.

For background, I use a WDT tool, distributer, and a “calibrated” tamper from amazon (not sure how accurate it is).

I smiled slightly: ""Do you have any business with me?""

""Oscar just took off that girl's pants, he didn't rape her, but he's still sentenced to a year...""

""He's the only bloodline of the Smith Family, I have to bail him out...""

I said flatly, ""Sorry, we don't have the money!""

01

""Mom! Mom! Did a thief come to our house?""

I pushed open the bedroom door, and it was a mess inside. Makeup was scattered everywhere, clothes were turned over, and the new sheets were covered in footprints.

My eyes were almost spitting fire.

""Why are you shouting! Your cousin came to play for a while this morning."" My mom said impatiently.

""Didn't I lock the door? How did he get in?""

""Why lock the door when you're idle? Luckily, we have a spare key at home, I opened the door for him with it.""

My mom criticized me while proudly saying so.

It was always my cousin. He seemed particularly interested in my bedroom and would turn it upside down every time he came.

I swallowed my anger, tidied up as I dialed my aunt's number.

""Auntie, let Oscar take the phone!"" I rudely said before my aunt could open her mouth.

""What stirred you up again? Oscar, your sister is looking for you...""

""What's up, Natalie Grant?"" He always called me by my full name.

""If you dare enter my room again, I'll call the police and have them arrest you!"" I roared.

""Tsk, the police won't care about you, besides, you don't have anything valuable in your room, what are you afraid of!""

My cousin is in sixth grade; these words don't intimidate him anymore.

""Don't dream of entering my house again!"" I continued to roar.

""That's my aunt's house, not yours. By the way, Natalie Grant, can you throw away that old-fashioned bra of yours...""

I was trembling with rage and hung up the phone before he could finish.

""Look at how you talk to your brother, you as an elder sister should know to let him have some leeway...""

My mom started her daily nagging again.

""Ah! My newly assembled LEGO..."" My roar came from the bedroom once again.

This LEGO was a birthday gift I bought for myself with the scholarship after entering college. It was a ""Disney Castle,"" and it took me two months to gradually assemble it.

Now it was torn apart into pieces.

02

My mom always instilled the idea that our family was poor and needed to be thrifty since I was little, so she never bought me any toys.

Whatever I wanted, I told my dad secretly, but all the money at home was managed by my mom, so my dad could only occasionally buy something for me.

When he bought things, we had to hide them; otherwise, if my mom saw, I'd get a scolding.

But my cousin Oscar always had countless toys and many branded clothes since he was little, mostly from my mom.

Of course, when I was little, I didn't know this, nor did I know from kindergarten until now in the sixth grade, Oscar's tuition was all covered by my mom.

She was certainly not rich, nor did she have a decent job.

When she was eighteen, to build a house and find a wife for their son, my maternal grandparents ""sold"" my mom to my dad for a dowry of sixteen thousand yuan.

My dad was fifteen years older than my mom.

He ran a small business and had an urban household registration and some money. His ex-wife died from liver cancer, so he remarried my mom.

But my mom didn't have any complaints about this.

She believed sacrificing herself for her brother's happiness was the right thing to do.

03

""From now on, I won't allow anyone from my uncle's family to enter my room!"" My voice was a bit loud due to anger.

""You little brat, is there gold in your room? So many problems every day. If you keep causing trouble, I'll throw you out and let your uncle and brother live here!""

My mom jabbed a finger towards the door as she spoke with her arms akimbo.

In her eyes, I always seemed to be an outsider.

Our argument was heated, and my dad walked in, pushing the door open.

""This brat is getting more and more out of hand because you spoil her. Just hurry up and find someone to marry her off, let her mother-in-law deal with her, and we can even pocket some dowry...""

My dad entered the room holding his waist but hadn't sat down before my mom began pointing at his nose, cursing.

""My daughter has to be well chosen for marriage. I don't want dowry, it's all for Daisy...""

My dad sat on the couch, looking at me with indulgence.

""You're senile, not wanting dowry when we've raised her for free until now...""

""Dad, your back is hurting again, let's go to the hospital quickly.""

I noticed my dad's face was pale, and his lips had no color. I wanted to take him to the hospital.

""Hospitals are just money traps; it's just back pain. I'll ask your aunt for some home remedies, no need to go to the hospital."" My mom's sharp voice was a bit jarring.

""Auntie is a doctor? Can she cure everything!"" I retorted.

My dad pulled my hand: ""I'm fine, don't worry, your mom is right, no need to go to the hospital.""

""No, we must go!""

Seeing my firm attitude, my dad had no choice but to nod: ""Alright, alright, but it's too late to get an appointment now, let's go tomorrow.""

Poor dad, unless he was sick and needed money, he didn't even know he was selling himself short like this.

04

In the evening, as I was rebuilding the LEGO under overtime, I heard my parent's argument coming from the living room.

""So after working ourselves to death for so many years, we only saved fifty thousand?"" My dad angrily questioned my mom.

""How much do you think we can save? You really don't know how expensive things are if you're not managing money yourself. Daily expenses, Daisy's education, utilities, and property fees all need money. You think I spent it all? I'm scrimping and saving all the time...""

As she spoke, my mom choked up as if she was about to cry.

Every time they argued, regardless of who was right or wrong, my mom always managed to take the initiative, and coupled with her acting skills, it always ended with my dad admitting fault.

This time seemed different.

""Don't give me that! I may not manage the money, but I know how much I earn. Tell me, did you give it all to your brother?"" My dad's voice was simmering with anger.

I paused with a block in hand.

In these years, my dad ran a small supermarket, earning about a hundred thousand annually. My mom worked in a garment factory, earning seventy to eighty thousand annually. Having only fifty thousand in hand didn't add up.

""The money was spent by us, don't talk nonsense without evidence!""

My dad has always been tongue-tied, facing my mom's outright denial, he couldn't say a word.

""Dad, the bank can print the transaction details of the bank card, it will be clear where the money went."" I came out to back him up.

In fact, both my dad and I knew where the money went.

""Alright, you two ingrates think of me as a thief, ganging up on me. I work hard every day to serve you..."" My mom began throwing a fit again, crying and shouting, like someone was going to dig her ancestors' graves.

""Forget it, don't let a little money mess up the family harmony. If the money is gone, I can earn it again. Tomorrow I won't go to the hospital, I'll go and watch the store.""

My dad habitually gave in.

I sat next to my dad, patting his leg to let him remain calm, then looked towards my mom.

""Mom, it's not that Dad and I don't trust you, but what if the money was stolen? Bank cards aren't that secure anymore. Since you don't want us to check, then we won't check.""

Hearing what I said, my mom's attitude softened as well.

""But Dad's illness still needs checking, I'll accompany him tomorrow. You don't need to take a leave, no point in wasting everyone's time.""

My mom thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.

The next day, before leaving, I got the bank card from her on the pretext of needing to pay fees.

05

After the check-up, I took my dad straight to the bank.

The five-year transaction record wasn't as long as I had imagined.

My dad and I stood at the bank entrance, going through it line by line.

Fifty thousand, twenty thousand, a hundred thousand... all went into one account.

No need to ask, it must be my uncle's.

The further we read, the more my dad's hands trembled, until finally, he nearly stumbled, and I quickly helped him to sit on the steps.

""Dad, don't worry, we'll think of a way to get the money back."" I rubbed my dad's back and comforted him.

After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice a bit hoarse.

""All these years, I always felt your mom was wronged by marrying me. So no matter how much she helped her family, I turned a blind eye, but I didn't expect...""

""Let's go back; I'll talk to your mom face-to-face.""

Back home, my dad's face and legs were somewhat swollen, and he limply collapsed onto the sofa.

""You're back, when can we get the test results? I told you it's unnecessary to go to the hospital...""

My mom started her nagging as soon as she walked in.

Seeing my dad's and my darkened faces, she realized something was wrong.



My dad glared at her, saying word by word, ""I'll ask you one last time, where did all the money go?""

""For Daisy's schooling..."" Facing this situation, my mom's demeanor weakened as well.

It was about me again, every time there was a big expense in the family, mom would always say it was spent on me.

But from childhood to adulthood, I rarely bought new clothes and hardly ate out. The only time I had KFC was when Oscar insisted on it, and my mom finally got me a set as well. Although my dad ran a small supermarket, my mom never allowed me to touch the snacks or toys.

I knew how hard they worked to earn money, so I never dared to spend recklessly.

As she spoke, my mom also ran out of steam.

06

""Mom, I'm in my junior year now, and you've only ever given me tuition fees. The living expenses have all been covered by my part-time work and scholarships. You always say it's spent on me, but I can't bear this burden,"" I said mockingly.

This time, my mom returned to her usual domineering self.

With hands on her hips, she pointed at me and my dad, ""Alright, so you're bullying me because my family is weak, right? Just you wait!""

After saying that, she grabbed her bag and stormed out angrily.

The air fell silent instantly, only the loud slam of the door echoed in the hallway.

We had already gotten used to it.

Every time they quarreled, mom would angrily storm back to her family home. At first, my dad would go back with a smile to invite her back, only to be mocked by her mother's family.

Later he just let her be, and in no time at all, she would waltz back on her own.

But this time was different. The next day, grandma and the whole family came along with her.

Early in the morning, I hadn't even gotten out of bed when I heard loud banging on the door.

As soon as my dad opened the door, it was like a bandit had barged in.

""I heard you bullied my sister?"" My uncle spoke first.

He had a shaved head, spent all day idling, and indulged in every vice. For some reason, my aunt always turned a blind eye to it.

""Mom, all of you are here, come in and sit down,"" my dad ignored him.

I quickly got dressed to support my dad.

As soon as I stepped out, I saw my uncle sitting on the sofa, his arm resting on the back, legs crossed on the coffee table in front.

My aunt and grandma were on either side of my mom, one holding her hand, the other constantly patting her back.

Their prized son, their good grandson, entered focused on his phone, never lifting his gaze.

07

My mom teared up, ""I work tirelessly every day to serve the two of them, but never expected them to be ungrateful wolves...""

With that, she started sobbing again.

""Such a grand spectacle, I suppose my mom told you everything."" I said coldly.

""Your mom just spent a bit of money, did that warrant bullying her like this?"" Grandma said bitterly.

""Spent a bit of money? Seven hundred thousand in total!"" My dad couldn't help but speak.

Upon hearing that amount, both grandma and mom were noticeably shocked, only my uncle remained indifferent.

After a three-second pause, my mom jumped up again.

""Nonsense! Just because you say it's seven hundred thousand doesn't make it so, what proof do you have?""

Evidence?

I took out the bank statements I had kept in my pocket and tossed them onto the table.

""Getting ruder and ruder."" Grandma mumbled.

My mom glared at me, picked up the papers from the table, and began examining them closely.

""You transferred money to my uncle time and again, did you even keep track of how much you've sent?""

This was the first time my mom didn't retort. She was visibly flustered.

My uncle shrank his neck, folding his arms defensively, as if it had nothing to do with him.

""Daisy, this money went to your uncle, not some outsider. Do you and your dad really need to be so angry?"" Grandma spoke casually.

I chuckled softly.

""So our whole family is just working for my uncle, huh.""

""You're a girl, you'll get married off sooner or later. Your dad and mom helping your uncle now means Oscar will have someone to back him up when he grows up.""

Hearing this, I glanced at my cousin sitting in the corner of the couch.

Five foot two, a hundred and fifty pounds, with thick glasses. His young face already exuding oiliness and sleaze.

I couldn't help but feel a wave of disgust inside me.

""No need for that, as long as this brother doesn't suck the life out of me, I'll be grateful,"" I deliberately shot a glance at my uncle as I spoke.



""You little brat, you forgot how when you spent summer vacations back home, I taught you how to wash clothes and cook, and your aunt bought you a whole bunch of treats."" Grandma stormed over angrily.

I quickly stepped aside.

08

""Yeah, you taught me how to wash clothes and cook. The entire summer, I did all the laundry and cooking. I was so young back then, I couldn't even hold a bowl steady, spilled hot soup on my foot, and still have a scar from it now.""

""As for the snacks my aunt supposedly bought me, weren't they just expired goods that the neighbor working at the supermarket brought home for her? My aunt was afraid my cousin would get a stomachache from them, so she gave them all to me. I was too young to know better, and after eating them, I ended up with a stomachache and went to the hospital.""

""Every time you all get together, you have to bring this up, as if I owe you such a great favor. I used to not want to expose the truth,

trying to maintain some dignity.""

""I'm really lucky I didn't end up dying that summer at your hands!"" I became more and more agitated as I spoke, my voice unconsciously growing louder.

My mom rushed over and ""smack,"" a loud slap landed on my face.

My face immediately felt burning hot, itchy, and painful.

""How can you hit your daughter?"" My dad quickly pulled me over, shielding me behind him.

""Such disrespect and ingratitude, she deserved it long ago!""

""Hit her, hit her to death!"" my cousin immediately lifted his eyes from his phone, shouting excitedly.

The others looked on with eyes full of satisfaction.

See, a daughter's feelings and dignity mean nothing to this mother.

""Enough, stop wasting time, let's talk about the real issue,"" I suppressed the grievance in my heart.

""Just now, you all saw, Lily gave Eric seven hundred thousand in total. If you give me back this money, we'll act like nothing happened.""

""Where are we supposed to find money to pay you back?"" my aunt muttered quietly, but I heard it clearly.

""Do you think I'm stupid? Why should I pay you back? My sister gave me the money voluntarily; I don't have to return it."" My uncle, silent up until now, spoke up.

""You sure know a lot, truly shameless!"" I cursed silently in my heart.

""This wasn't voluntary from my dad. I suggest you obediently hand over the money, or else I'll take each one of you to court.""

Grandma knew I wasn't as easy to bully as my dad.

09

""Good child, we're all family, let's talk nicely. Look, your family has a car and a house; you're not short of money. Your uncle's family, on the other hand, Oscar is about to start middle school in the city, your uncle just bought a house near the school, your aunt is pregnant again, and they really need the money now...""

The prices of houses near every middle school in our city are quite high.

When I was in school, our home was too far from school, and I always had to wake up an hour and a half early, then take the bus to school, often falling asleep on the bus due to exhaustion.

Spending other people's money on a house without any concern.

I glanced again at my aunt's slightly rounded belly. When she was pregnant with Oscar, the doctor said my uncle's health was poor, and it was already lucky for my aunt to get pregnant. But now she could even have a second child.

""Mom, don't listen to her scare tactics. I'll tell you, Natalie Grant, your uncle has been around in society for so many years, do you think I'd be afraid of your little tricks!""

""What if I simply have my dad file for divorce, I've already looked into it...""

Before I could finish speaking, another loud slap landed on my cheek.

Suddenly, I felt a bit dizzy.

""You wretched thing, instigating your parents to divorce! If I had known, I should have strangled you when you were born!""

My mom's eyes were red, looking at me like an enemy.

This time my dad didn't protect me.

""It hasn't come to a divorce, has it..."" he whispered in my ear.

10

Actually, it's not that I'm too unreasonable, rather over the years, I've realized my mom only sees my dad as a money-making tool.

Every day, expecting my dad to work from six thirty in the morning until eleven thirty at night, never allowing him even half a day off even if he were sick.

Whenever things weren't to her liking, she'd take it out on me and my dad, even locking my dad out at night, forcing him to sleep back at the store.

After so many years of marriage, my dad only ever moved between two places, just making money, with no life of his own.

""Hmph, a girl can say such things despite being educated. Seeing her like this, you should give all the money to Eric, not leave any for this ingrate!""

""Natalie Grant, I'm telling you, I won't give you a single penny, let's see what you can do!""

With that, my uncle stood up abruptly and pulled my aunt towards the door.

As they were leaving, my cousin made a mocking gesture at me, raising his middle finger.

Truly shameless!

""Satisfied now? Offending your uncle, let's see if anyone will help you in the future!""

It would be really nice to have a loyal, committed friend deeper than a brother or cousin, but not romantic or sexual. For personal reasons it’s a boundary-crosser, but it’d still be nice to find someone committed, loyal, and even willing to reserve a large part of their heart for the other person

1mb3wnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india_cycling/comments/1mb3wnq/my_experience_completing_a_tough_challenge/,My experience completing a tough challenge,"Since I started recreational cycling in 2008, I've gone through phases where I go through intense cycling followed by months of hardly cycling. I was going through one such, a solid 2023 with over 3000 km of cycling was followed by 2024 where I hardly cycled and struggled to complete 2000 km. In the first 5 months of 2025, I had ridden just over a 1000 km. But June was good where I had completed the Anchetty 200 BRM and buoyed by that, I wanted to keep the momentum going. Bangalore Randonneurs has an annual monsoon challenge, where you need to do 10 rides of 100 km. I signed up for it, thinking I have ridden 200 km in a day, 100 should be easy right?  I didn't realise what I had signed up for. 

Route :  I had done centuries in a bit over 4 hours. But that was on a straight highway with no traffic, I would have to travel almost 1-2 hours in my car to get to those roads (STRR, Old Madras Road). So, I decided that I would ride door to door. I set myself a target of 4:30 for 100 km

I thought it would be a good chance to try different routes going to different parts of Bangalore. But a couple of rides in, I gave up on that and focussed on routes that I was familiar with and allowed me to cross the 100 km mark. So, I ended up doing just a few routes all around south and east Bangalore.

The routes that I ended up doing were :

* Home (Sarjapur Road)-Shoolagiri via Hosur Road-Home (4 times)
* Home - Indiranagar-Hoskote-Malur-Bagalur-Home (2 times)
* Home-Shoolagiri-Berigai-Bagalur-Home (1 time)
* Home-Hosur-Bagalur-Home (1 time)
* Home - Hoskote-STRR-Home (1 time)
* Home-Kanakpura Road-Kagglipura-Jigani-Anekal-Attibele-Home (1 time)

Elevation : Bangalore being fairly high up means that anywhere you ride, you generally go downhill (e.g. Shoolagiri is at 620 m vs 800 for Bangalore). The flip side is that the return is almost always a climb. And that brings me to ...

Headwind : This time of the year, the winds are particularly fierce and the routes I had chosen meant that I had a tailwind on the way out and a headwind on the way back. Coupled with the elevation gain, that meant that the last 50 was almost always a struggle and quite a bit slower than the first half.

Food : I can easily manage a 60-70 km ride with just a coffee in the morning. But, I was wary of bonking with the climb and headwind, so ended up eating breakfast at the midway mark. Breakfast was always a  heavy affair (pongal, rice bath) so the ride after was quite difficult and slow. By the 80 km mark, I again tended to stop for a drink of Fanta and maybe a pastry if I was feeling like I needed more fuel. 

Speed : Overall, I ended up with a moving time of 52 hours for 1050 km, which is an average of 20 kmph. But the total elapsed time was close to 67 hours. This meant an average time of over 6 hours each ride, I would leave at 6:00 and be back between 12 and 12:30. On the 9th ride on my road bike, I managed to complete it in 4:30 by pushing myself, but the next day (10th ride), I felt its effect and didnt feel the energy and had to struggle to complete the ride.

Mental state : The most difficult part was the last few rides. The wife was not too happy with me disappearing for 6-7 hours. Luckily, I don't have a full time job, so I didn't have the pressure of work (kudos to those who manage it with a full time job). But still, by the 9th ride, I really had to push myself and couldn't wait to get done with the challenge. 

The road ahead: The last 2 months have been good, I have done more than 1700 km. I have signed up for the Tour de 100, a challenge I participated in 2023. I hope with as motivation, I will be able to get beyond 5000 km for the year. 

Brevets : Having completed the Anchetty brevet, I had a dream of doing a SR. This series has kind of killed that dream. I think physically I will be able to do those long rides (I have completed 300/400 in the past), but I am just not ready for it mentally. Maybe it will change, but I think I will be happier with doing longer 100-150 km rides with cycling groups

Bike : The one definitive conclusion is that I prefer my hybrid over the road bike. The difference in speed is not massive, I feel more comfortable not being bent over and the thicker 40c tyres make the road more bearable. I am very seriously considering not having a road bike in my garage for the first time in over 10 years.

(may be a little tmi sorry) as well as this i haven’t been excreting as often, this time around i hadn’t in 2-3 days and i had to drink a coffee in order to and when i do it can be hard to pass and hard in general (sorry again) 

it was healthy and the start but then realised i could count calories and didn’t have to stop and just 10 min workouts which i had been doing since january. from the middle of may i was working out 35 mins everyday then moved on to walking instead and eating from 800 to 1300 cal a day on average and haven’t been able to stop. 

i have slowed down on exercise bc i’m experiencing so much burnout. my friends and family are concerned as i have gone from 10 stone 8 to now around 8 stone 9-10 since late april early may and noticed that i don’t have the same relationship with food as i used to.

i am not asking for diagnosis / validation or any of the sort ofc bc that’s a real professionals job but i am asking for genuine help and wondering if this is a real cause for concern as i am aware and concerned for myself as well as not wanting to feel this way anymore n

I was blocked within two hours. He has never acknowledged the significance of the relationship's end.,"I wrote:

""Just thought l'd message you here since it's a tad more casual than other platforms.
I've been thinking about how I was 6 or 7 years ago and just want to say how sorry am for my past behaviour towards you. I believe was quite ill, even if subclinically, for a long time, and know how difficult it was for you to deal with my depression. know you tried your best and things were very hard, and I'm truly sorry for my past actions.

I'm a bit surprised to find myself blocked, especially after I had reached out to offer an apology, mostly for my own sense of closure.

It feels as though you've found it difficult to engage with uncomfortable emotions, and that has, at times, made it hard for you to acknowledge the impact of certain actions on me.

I don't feel I ever intended to cause you harm, perhaps only to care a bit too much. I had truly hoped we might at least remain friends because we had so much in common, but it feels like I've been completely erased from your history. I believe an apology is due for the way you handled meeting me after we separated, but I understand that may not be something you're able to offer.

Your tendency to withdraw and avoid discomfort might offer you temporary comfort, but I hope for your own sake, that you eventually find a way to process these difficult emotions. The abrupt way our relationship ended, after six years, with very little explanation beyond a simple ""I can't do this anymore,"" left me deeply confused. More recently, after we reconnected for coffee and intimacy, it felt as though you once again disengaged without a trace once that encounter was over. When I tried to talk to you about how hurtful that felt, I was met with silence. It left me feeling hugely disappointed and let down. I find myself struggling to reconcile the man I once knew with these experiences. But I understand we're different people now. Perhaps you're still navigating your own pain, or maybe your mental health might be in a challenging place right now. Maybe you're simply not ready to communicate, or perhaps you genuinely never want to speak to me again. But for my own peace of mind, I would find some clarity incredibly helpful, rather than being left completely in the dark. The lack of explanation feels genuinely difficult to process.""

Her breath rose in clouds and clung to the porch light. I watched from across the street. I didn’t join the search— Not because I didn’t *care*.

But because I knew it was coming.

You see… I was there during the Snowstorm of ‘68. I was just a boy then— but I remember how bad things got. Our power failed, crops died and the lake iced over so thick they had to cut out bodies.

People around here *remember* that storm.

But they don’t remember the *deal*.

My grandfather, Joseph Peters, was one of the original signers. There were thirteen of them. Elders, farmers, tradesmen. He kept the truth in a shoebox that I found one day while playing—newspaper clippings, journal entries, a photo of a thing that wasn’t quite human but stood tall in a snow-covered cornfield. My mind was blown. 

He said it came from the tree line during the thick of that storm. Said it spoke through frozen wind. The creature made them an offer: one life in exchange for safe winters. It wouldn’t take more than it was owed and would only expect to collect from Joseph’s bloodline— one soul for the towns lives. 

They said yes, of course. With so many people dying— What else could they do?

It took my cousin Jack that very night.

I remember the way Aunt Fran screamed. How they had to bury an empty coffin and how my grandfather watched that tree line.

———

Today, I’m older than my grandfather was then.

And here we are experiencing another snowfall. Nobody knows what’s coming. The coffee shop is still open. The post office too. Kids play on sleds like there’s not an ancient, starving thing curled beneath the crust of the town, waiting to be fed.

But I know better.

That’s why early this morning— before the children put on their boots. Before the town could cheer. I walked to the edge of that tree line just as my grandfather had done many years ago. And there it was—tall, blue as moonlight, with skin like snow. 

It didn’t speak. 

But the air began to shift . A quiet fell over us— but not quiet like silence— quiet like *waiting*.

I nodded.

And I whispered Jonah Peters name. 

It only eats when it snows in Landensburg— And every snowfall, I make sure that it won’t be me. ",46,1753666965.0,shortscarystories,14,0.95,False
1mb3ml2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1mb3ml2/dating_anxiety/,Dating Anxiety,"I was in a relationship for 8 years, broke up around 7 months ago, I've gone on grindr, had hookups, done the same with guys I've met in the wild.

I've been asked out on a coffee/drink/date/hangout and I'm terrified, I'm kinda socially shy and get anxious easily, I know it's not serious and it should just be a fun hangout, but now I'm just super nervous about what to wear, talk about, order.

I can't tell if its just normal anxiety or if I might be rushing things by going on a date so soon...

He was kind of an asshole when we broke up, so I kind of felt emotionally ready after like 5 months, but now I'm kind of just running through every scenario possible in my head and starting to think I'm not ready to socialize.

Edit

Do I ever bring up it's my first date in a while?
