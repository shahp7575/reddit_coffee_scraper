When I got my drink, it was cold and the foam was all flat. I politely asked the barista if they could remake it because I paid good money. They said no because I didn’t specify hot enough and that I should have asked. Now I think they’re just trying to get away with bad service. My question is, did I overreact or is this a legit case of coffee negligence? Also, u/CoffeeHater keeps saying I’m just a coffee snob but I think they’re just bitter about their own coffee choices.

Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata, Ocarina of Time, and 7th Dragon 2020. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***

That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Is it ok to punch Nazis? 


Always has been.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<

Continuation

I chose the bridge because it was tall enough to end most things.

It was late. The road was empty. The water below didn’t move the way it does in daylight—it waited, dark and patient, like it had time to spare.

I climbed the railing without ceremony. I didn’t hesitate. Hesitation implies doubt, and I lost the habit of that a long time ago.

I knew it wouldn’t work.

That knowledge didn’t stop me.

The air rushed past my ears on the way down. For a brief moment, my body remembered fear out of habit, like an old reflex firing without purpose. Then the water took me hard, slammed the breath from my chest, wrapped cold around my bones.

It hurt.

It always hurt.

Pain just stopped meaning anything after a while.

The water dragged me down, deeper than the light, deeper than sound. My lungs burned. My muscles fought even though I hadn’t asked them to. The body is stubborn. It clings long after the mind has let go.

I didn’t struggle.

Sometimes people jump in after me. Sometimes they don’t. Sometimes I wake up coughing on a shore with strangers kneeling over me, hands shaking like they’ve saved something important. Sometimes I wake up alone, soaked and breathing, the world carrying on as if I hadn’t just tried to leave it.

Either way, I wake up.

I sank until the pressure dulled everything, until thought slowed and drifted apart. There was no peace in it. No release. Just the familiar slide of consciousness turning sideways, like sleep that refuses to finish its work.

Then nothing.

When I came back, the world had moved forward without asking my permission.

It always does.

Time passes. Hours, days, sometimes more. I don’t check calendars anymore. They’re cruel in a way mirrors aren’t. Mirrors show you what doesn’t change. Calendars show you what does.

My body heals. Bones knit. Bruises fade. Lungs remember their job. I don’t age. I don’t weaken. I don’t improve.

People like to ask how it feels.

I never know what to tell them.

Doctors have cut me open under bright lights and careful hands. They’ve whispered words like miracle and anomaly, like those sounds could explain the distance between wanting something to end and knowing it won’t. They’ve taken samples. Measurements. Pictures.

They never find what they’re looking for.

Neither do I.

By morning, I was dry again. Clean clothes. A borrowed room that smelled faintly of disinfectant and coffee. Someone had left a cup of water on the table beside the bed. I drank it out of habit, not thirst.

Habit is harder to kill than the body.

I stood by the window and watched the street wake up. Cars passed. People crossed intersections with places to be. Lives continued, smooth and uninterrupted.

I felt nothing about it.

That part worried me once.

It doesn’t anymore.

I left before anyone could ask questions. Questions invite conversations, and conversations invite attachments, and attachments have an expiration date I don’t.

Outside, the day was ordinary. The sky didn’t mark what I’d tried to do beneath it. The river moved on, unconcerned with my failure.

I walked until my legs told me to stop, then kept going a little longer out of spite. Not toward anything. Just away.

I didn’t expect relief.

I never do.

All I expected was what always came next.

Continuation.

By the next afternoon, I was standing under fluorescent lights, pushing a cart that rattled no matter how carefully I steered it.

The store smelled like detergent and overripe fruit. Everything was too bright. Too clean. A place built for people who expected to go home.

I moved through the aisles slowly. Motion keeps you ordinary. Standing still invites attention.

Bread. Water. Something canned. I didn’t bother checking prices. Money accumulates when time doesn’t spend you.

A man passed me near the dairy section and slowed. His phone lifted, subtle but not subtle enough. I didn’t look at him. Cameras only matter if you pretend they don’t exist.

I turned down another aisle.

That was when I heard my name.

Not loud. Not urgent. Just familiar.

The cart stopped on its own.

I hadn’t heard that voice in two years. Not since the night metal folded wrong and glass decided where it wanted to go. Not since I stood alone in an apartment that still smelled like her shampoo and decided a funeral would only make things worse.

I never went.

I told myself absence would hurt less.

I stood there, fingers locked around the handle, while the aisle hummed and refrigerators sighed and the world continued to sell milk.

She said my name again.

I turned.

For half a second, I expected to see her between the shelves. Same posture. Same way she used to tilt her head when she was trying to remember something she already knew.

My chest tightened.

Just once.

Then there was nothing. No one. Only boxes and labels and a child tugging at his mother’s sleeve two aisles down.

The sound didn’t come again.

I waited longer than I needed to. Long enough for the moment to prove it had nothing left to give me.

People stared. They always do when you stop moving. A woman pretended to read the back of a cereal box while watching my reflection in the freezer door. Someone whispered. Someone took another picture.

I pushed the cart forward.

My hands didn’t shake.

That surprised me more than the voice had.

At the register, the cashier glanced at me twice. Recognition flickered, followed by something like awe, then discomfort. She rang up my items quickly, as if speed might protect her.

“Have a good day,” she said.

I nodded.

Outside, the air felt heavier. As if the world had gained weight while I was inside.

I walked past a group of teenagers arguing about whether it was really me. One of them laughed too loud. Another crossed himself.

I didn’t react.

I hadn’t when the doctors called me a miracle either. When they measured my heart rate and asked me to hold still. When they spoke about hope like it was contagious.

They wanted answers.

I wanted rest.

Neither of us got what we asked for.

The sound of her voice stayed with me longer than it should have.

Not painful.

Just present.

That was worse.

Night found me on the coast.

I don’t remember deciding to go there. My feet chose it for me. The sand was cool where it hadn’t held the day’s warmth, uneven beneath my back when I lay down and let the bags fall from my hands.

Above me, the stars didn’t care.

They never have.

The tide moved in and out with the same patience it’s always had. I watched it for a long time, waiting for something to rise in my chest. Fear. Gratitude. Regret.

Nothing came.

I thought about the bridge. About the water closing over my head. About the first time it happened—about how death had opened its mouth and sent me back.

I used to think effort meant something. That persistence would eventually be rewarded with silence.

I was wrong.

Even failing takes energy. Even despair asks something of you. After centuries, it becomes another task. Another motion repeated until the meaning wears thin.

I didn’t stop trying because I wanted to live.

I stopped because I was tired.

The sand pressed into my spine. Wind carried salt and cold and distant laughter from somewhere far down the beach. Lives continuing, untouched.

I closed my eyes.

Not hoping.

Not surrendering.

Just letting time do what it has always done.

Continue.

I’m headed your way early February to see family and I don’t ski. I don’t even own snow pants (ha!). I won’t have a car, but I’m happy to Uber a bit. Looking for recommendations on things to do during a weekday while my family is on the slopes.

Thinking about:

* Getting a massage — any favorite places?
* Seeing a matinee — good theaters to check out?
* Lunch recommendations?

I’ve been before and have walked the strip with all the shops/restaurants. Are there any gems I may have missed?

I am open to other ideas like museums, art galleries, coffee spots, scenic walks (that don’t require ski gear :) Thanks in advance!",1,1768006680.0,parkcityvisitors,0,1.0,False

September 2nd

Tonic (stiff legs)

\#1: Mom was on the treadmill (400 calories, no issues).  She was done on treadmill and asked me what I wanted to eat for dinner.  We decided on me eating pasta.  I was on my loveseat reclined with heated blanket on my legs so mom couldn’t see what my legs were doing.  She turned around and walked to my nook table and asked me again what I wanted to eat.  I didn’t answer her, then she turned back around and saw me in a fencing position.  My noggin was turned to the left, left hand in a fencing position above my noggin.  Didn’t know where my right hand was.  So, she yelled my name; “Kylie, don’t die” and “Kylie, come back “ and I still wasn’t responding, so she gently lowered  me off of the loveseat onto the floor; turned me to the right so I drooled on the right side.  Then she yelled for dad (he was upstairs) and said “I think Kylie is having a seizure, call 911”.  So, he called 911, got disconnected outside then called them back.  Dad found my iPad in the loveseat.  An ambulance came with both lights and sirens then lights only no sirens.  Mom said as I was coming out of it I turned to the right and looked at her and said “who are you?” two times (that I don’t remember).  I don’t remember any part of this seizure.  I woke up on the floor sitting to the west and saw a bunch of paramedics down here and a gurney.  I remember saying “what the heck “.  The ambulance female driver said that I had a seizure so they put me on the gurney (basement back door) and they parked in the grass.  The drive to the hospital I kept saying how scared I was and thought that I might die.  I was holding a male paramedic’s hand (John) lying in the gurney on the ride to the hospital.  Mom was rider too.  No seizures in ambulance.  I was nervous and my legs felt jittery.  Mom said that I got real stiff then afterwards my legs felt like jello and were sore for a couple days.



September 2nd

Focal impaired awareness (bicycle legs)

\#2: Once at the hospital in the hospital bed, after coming back from a CT scan, I was  sitting up in the hospital bed and I remember turning to the left (no control) so mom left the room and could see my legs bicycling.  So, the nurses gave me Kepra (IV) but Dr. Glover said Kepra doesn’t mix well with Sertraline, so switched me to Vimpat (IV)



Vimpat (orally)

Side effects (underlying unstable noggin)



Taste was off so night drink is now coffee

Loss of appetite 

Dizziness 

Blurry dreams

Lightning app looked weird and Fred beeping sounded weird



A piece of paper at my new patient neurology appointment someone had noted that I had 2 seizures 



November 13th

Jacksonian

\#3:  Mom and dad were in the gym room and I was sitting on my loveseat coloring on my iPad with stylus in my left hand and listening to a July 14th weather snippet that I completed..  I felt pretty relaxed.  It felt like I lost consciousness for a few seconds then woke up rubbing both my eyes and wondered if I had another seizure.  I felt jittery and nervous and my right ankle felt like jello  (and still does) and left pinky felt tingly.  So, mom put Sadie away in her bedroom (door closed all the way and latched) and made me go up to the middle floor for the rest of the evening and I didn’t have anymore seizures.  Dad said that I didn’t have a seizure cuz I didn’t knock my drinks, drop my pad and stylus stayed in my left hand.  I googled “do you always drool during seizures” and the answer was no.  Mom was monitoring me the rest of the evening and made me go to bed a little earlier than usual.",1,1768006620.0,seizures,0,1.0,False

Do not get out of bed tomorrow.

I froze. Wrong number? Glitch? Sleep-deprived brain? I told myself I’d laugh in the morning.

By 7:42 a.m., it buzzed again.

Turn left at the corner. Do not talk to her.

I hadn’t even left the apartment yet. My hands shook as I locked the door. I took the stairs instead of the elevator. At the corner, I turned left. Nothing happened. No one spoke to me. I laughed too loudly to be convincing.

12:00 p.m. — You will spill coffee.

At 12:01, it soaked through my shirt.

The texts came every hour. Precise. Correct. Creeping closer to impossible.

3:07 p.m. — The cat will knock over the lamp.
6:18 p.m. — You will think about deleting these messages. You won’t.

I tried anyway. Deleted the thread. It reappeared.
Turned my phone off. It vibrated in my pocket.
Let the battery die. The screen lit up.

That night, the tone changed.

Do not sleep. She is coming.

I didn’t know who she was. I didn’t want to.

Shadows stretched where they shouldn’t. Furniture leaned closer when I looked away. I sat on the bed until my legs went numb, watching the door.

At 11:59 p.m., one last text arrived.

You are already too late.

My phone shut off. No battery. No signal.

Then I heard typing.

It wasn’t coming from my room.

In the kitchen, the refrigerator screen glowed. Words appeared, letter by letter:

Open the door.

I did. Cold air spilled out. Nothing else.

Another message appeared.

You’re next.

My phone buzzed behind me. The screen lit on its own. A new text was being typed. By me. Hands shaking exactly as mine did. Misspelling words the way I do when I’m scared.

Every message I hadn’t received yet was already there. Timestamped. Waiting.

I don’t sleep anymore.
I don’t leave the apartment.

Every vibration is a countdown.
Every notification a finger pointing at me.

Tonight, a new message arrived.

This is the last warning. You will read this tomorrow. And it will already be too late.

I impulse bought a beautiful 4s FAS Walnut 5 1/4 x 1 3/4"" that I want to use as-is as table legs. Preferably without messing it up since it was pricey.



But I'm confused on how to attach the apron. I've seen various folks basically drive a bolt through the corner brace into the leg, but since my walnut isn't square (and not that thick), I don't think that would work. Everybody tells me not to use pocket holes due to wood movement, especially with hickory.



What's the most beginner friendly, yet strong/correct way of doing this? I've considered glue + dowel pins but I've never used them. I know there's these dowel jigs you can buy. I own a router, tendon/mortise is definitely above my skill level, I could maybe do tongue and groove?

I just got a letter from insurance informing me that the genetic testing I had done was considered “medically unnecessary” because there’s no evidence of high iron/etc. 

I have been so tired—not normal “it’s the holidays and it is busy” tired. To my SOUL tired. All along I’ve been questioning my doctor telling me I definitely had HH in early December because…that ferritin!?!? And everything else stabilized? My ferritin is historically low but not that low. I was told I absolutely cannot supplement my iron due to HH and I just feel like we’re jumping the gun here based on one result of high iron and low UIBC? 

I want to push back on this diagnosis because:
- none of these labs were fasting
- all were done in the morning when I had coffee and maybe a gluten free bagel? Yogurt? Not much else. 
- I had taken a break from omeprazole briefly, burned my esophagus, resumed taking omeprazole a few days before test #1 (the thing that started this all)
- genetics says “HETEROZYGOUS FOR THE C282Y AND H63D PATHOGENIC VARIANTS” and we know that’s not the full picture
- my insurance clearly has questions

💰 Price: $40 (Retail is \~$72 + Tax)

🏷️ Tag: ✨ Brand New 



📦 Why this is useful:

Lift-Top Function: The top lifts up towards you, turning your coffee table into a desk or a dining table. Perfect for eating dinner while watching Netflix or working from the couch.

Hidden Storage: There is storage space underneath for remotes, snacks, or messy cables.

Condition: Brand New in Box (NIB). You get to assemble it fresh, so no scratches.



🧐 Gary's Note:

""This is the ultimate 'Student Starter Pack' item.

It's a Mainstays (Walmart Brand) table, so don't expect solid oak heirloom quality, but for $40 Brand New, the functionality is unbeatable.

The seller has 2 of them in boxes.

If you and a roommate both need one, it might be worth the drive to Chino Hills to grab both.

Recommendation: Great for anyone in a studio apartment where you don't have space for a separate dining table.""

1q8pszf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q8pszf/the_photo_that_wasnt_taken/,The photo that wasn’t taken,"I found a camera under a park bench on my way home. The first photo it printed showed my mom lying on the kitchen floor. I checked the timestamp. Monday. I hadn’t been in the kitchen. I hadn’t touched anything. I stared at the print like it could explain itself. It didn’t.

The camera was cold and heavy in my hands. The lens caught the light like it was watching me. I set it on the counter, but my fingers kept twitching toward it. Summer photography class. TikTok clips. Montreal. Moving out. My chest tightened thinking about leaving home, and I didn’t know which was worse: the camera, or everything it was showing me.

Click. The first print slid out. Coffee had spilled across Mom’s notebook, ink bleeding into the paper. I double-checked. No one else had been in the apartment. Nothing explained this. I laughed, sharp and hollow, trying to convince myself it was a trick. But deep down I knew it wasn’t.

The next morning, sketchbook pages had curled, and a pen rolled across the floor. I hadn’t touched anything. The smell of paper and ink hit me like smoke. Just photos. Nothing more, I told myself.

By midweek, things escalated. A chair tipped over. My laptop cracked. A print from the camera showed the same scene from last week, but slightly off. My pulse was hammering.

I spun for TikTok. Click. Print: me crouched, face buried in my hands, crying. I hadn’t done it. But it smelled like me — shampoo, sweater, hallway.

I tried spilling juice on purpose. Print: my secret handwriting, something I had hidden for years. Fingers shaking, I shoved it under my pillow.

Text from my girlfriend: “Move-in tomorrow! Can’t wait!” Another print slid out: a confession I had never sent. My heart thumped so hard it hurt.

Thursday. Everything was subtly wrong. Chair slightly moved, pen on the wrong side, curtains crooked. Print on the counter: me staring at a letter I hadn’t written. My smile cracked. Someone was watching.

Night. Cross-legged on the floor, camera on my knees. Print: bedroom door ajar, shadow stretching. Hoodie figure, face hidden. Hands pressed against the wall. I hadn’t taken this photo yet.

Footsteps outside my room. Pulse jagged. Click. Print: apartment from the ceiling, spilled juice, cracked laptop, tipped chair. Mom looking straight at me — alive. Empty eyes. Monday said she was gone. Funeral photos, hospital visits. She shouldn’t be here.

Friday. One last experiment. Camera pointed at me texting my girlfriend. Print: me frozen, phone dropped, grin gone. Timestamp five minutes.

I backed toward the window. Print slid across the floor. Me, doorway, eyes wide, empty. Exactly where I was.

Creak. Apartment smelled of coffee, ink, metallic tang. Heart kicked against my ribs.

Whir-click. Click. Print: hallway stretched impossibly long. Shadows pooled, folding. Hoodie figure pressed against the wall, moving forward.

I dropped it, but the shutter didn’t stop. Knees hit the carpet.

Whir-click. Last print: Mom smiling in the doorway. Wrong. Too wide. Too patient. The room behind me empty. Chair toppled, notebook open, prints scattered. No me.

*There’s times I need to roam*

*I move station to station*

*I showed up here alone.”*

*Arrow - The Head And The Heart*

Camellia’s Tavern. That’ll do.

I amble through the red doors at a quarter o’ ten. A blackboard sign out front had the words “Open Mike Night” scrawled in a sloppy yellow chalk. My kind o’ place.

It’s packed inside. There’s a guy on a small stage in the corner doing his best to make people laugh at politics. The booze is doing the heavy lifting.

The bartender is wearin’ a shirt that says, “Breathe if you’re horny.” I ask him if he’s got any coffee.

“You’re the second one tonight.” He pours it into a small styrofoam cup and pushes it in front of me. “Five bucks.”

“For coffee?”

“Coffee drinkers don’t never tip, so y’all got to pay it up front.” The double negative confirms my suspicion that he’s responsible for the sign outside. I give him five. All I got left to my name is $11.22. There’s no room at the bar, and it’s too cold to go back outside just yet.

I walk through the smoke, lookin’ for a seat. I see one table with an empty chair. A small table with a small woman sittin’ by herself. A long black peacoat drapes around her chair and the collar’s turned up. Black hair down to her shoulders. Ratty white gloves with the fingers missing cradle a styrofoam cup. A leather journal sits on the table in front of her with the words, “Any Poem, Any Price” written across the cover. 

The comic finishes his set and the crowd gives a round of lazy applause when I approach her.

“Excuse me?” She looks up and squints. “Mind if I sit down?” She eyes me up and down. She focuses on the bag I have over my shoulder and then my guitar case.

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“Do you play?”

“If you wanna call it that.” She squints her eyes again. She pushes the empty chair out from the table with her foot. “Much obliged.”

“You’re not supposed to be here.” 

“I’m not?”

“I just…” She stops mid sentence. She’s beautiful. “I’m Ella.”

“Sam.”

“Are you here to play?”

“Hell no. I just got into town from Jackson.”

“The roads are icy out there.”

“Didn’t drive. I came in on the train.” It takes her a minute and then she smiles. God, that smile.

“Are you a musical hobo or somethin’?”

“Or somethin’.” I notice a hand drawn daffodil on the cover of her journal. “You here to recite a poem?”

“Or somethin’.”

We talk. We ignore the music, the comedy, and the musin’s. She tells me that she’s from New Orleans. I tell her I’m from a town called Mariposa. We’re both just passin’ through. She asks me if I’ll play somethin’  for her, I tell her I will if she recites a poem for me.

\-

A trio is murderin’ “Free Bird”.

She has me. I’m bewitched. 

I tell her that I’ve been movin’ and wanderin’and when she asks why, I tell her the truth.

“Everythin’ feels fake when I stop movin’. If I’m movin’, I feel real. No one seems real anymore. So I keep movin’. I don’t know if that makes any sense.”

“It does. Just look at everyone in here. You can read them all by their eyes. Nothing behind them. All lies and dishonesty. If they ever heard REAL truth…” She drifts off and then she looks back at me. “You seem like a real person to me. I’m sure one day you’ll find a place that’ll make you want to slow down.”

“Or somethin’.” 

“I need to tell you the truth.” She looks worried. “I came in here for a reason. I have a job to do tonight.”

“What… are you gonna shoot the place up or somethin’?” 

She looks down at her journal.

“Or somethin’.”

The desecration of Skynard ends, and Ella stands up.

“Sam? Just trust me… don’t be scared. When you hear it, I know you’ll be fine.”

“What?”

“Real truth.” She turns and walks to the small stage. Several drunk assholes want “the beatnick” off the stage. Ella flips through the pages of her journal and settles somewhere in the middle. A couple of glasses of beer fly toward the stage and then it starts.

Or stops.

Ella speaks her truth.

Everything slows down. The beers movin’ toward the stage almost freeze in the air. Everyone in the bar gets up in slow motion. Ella’s voice is in my head. Felt more than heard. I don’t wanna move. For the first time in my life, I wanna be still. 

She keeps recitin’ her poem, but she stops lookin’ in her journal, and instead looks at me. 

Those eyes.

Now I move.

I stand up and walk forward, unencumbered by whatever lethargic spell the crowd is under. She’s spun a different spell on me.

 The whole crowd is gettin’ to their feet, makin’ low drawn out hollers of pain and agony. They pull at their clothes. Their bodies plump up slowly, like they’re bein’ filled from an air compressor. Faces distort. Eyes protrude. Shirts and blouses rip thread by thread.

I walk under the glasses that are inchin’ toward the stage while the beer that was inside ‘em is suspended in the air like a dawdlin’ creek. Ella keeps speakin’. Her eyes stay on me.

I step onto the stage. A rumblin’ fills the room. The crowd explodes behind me at a glacial pace in a helluva gory show. Limbs and insides are blown asunder. Ella finishes and I put my hand around her waist and pull her to me.

“That’s a helluva poem.” We look back at the bar. The whole bloody collage may as well be in zero gravity. “I was wonderin’ somethin’ though.”

“What?”

“Think we can set your words to a guitar?”

“Or somethin’.”

She smiles.

Hey there. I’m a 32 year old guy from Michigan who’s definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable I’m pretty laid back and sarcastic. I’m better one on one than in big groups and I prefer real conversations over small talk.

I work a job with weird hours, so my schedule is a little all over the place, but that also means I’m around to chat at random times. In the warmer months I love being outdoors hiking, kayaking, camping, anything like that. In winter I’m more of a homebody. Reading, binging shows, good coffee, and quiet nights are my thing.

I’m not looking for anything intense or forced. Just chill conversation, getting to know someone, sharing thoughts, laughs, random topics, or even comfortable silence. Friends are great, and if it turns into a longer term chat connection, even better.

If you’re introverted, over small talk, and just want someone easy to talk to, feel free to reach out.",0,1768005662.0,IntrovertsChat,1,0.5,False

1q8pjqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1q8pjqd/how_to_manifest_abundance_without_the_toxic/,How to Manifest ABUNDANCE Without the Toxic Positivity: The Psychology Behind What Actually Works,"Look, I've spent hundreds of hours digging through psychology research, behavioral science podcasts, and neuroscience studies because I was sick of the surface level manifestation advice that floods social media. You know the type, just think positive thoughts and the universe will deliver your dreams on a silver platter. That's not how any of this actually works. The manifestation trend has exploded, but most people are doing it completely wrong, then feeling like failures when nothing changes. Here's what actually creates abundance in your life, backed by science and real world application.

**Step 1: Stop confusing visualization with action**

The biggest manifestation myth? That you can just sit there visualizing your dream life and it'll magically appear. Research from NYU psychologist Gabriele Oettingen shows that pure positive fantasy actually decreases your chances of success. When you only visualize the end result without planning for obstacles, your brain thinks the work is already done. Your blood pressure drops, motivation tanks, and you end up doing less than people who didn't visualize at all.

What actually works is something called mental contrasting. You visualize your goal AND the obstacles you'll face getting there. This fires up your brain's problem solving circuits and creates real motivation. Try the WOOP method (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan). It sounds simple but it's ridiculously effective because it prepares your brain for reality instead of fantasy land.

**Step 2: Rewire your scarcity mindset (it's deeper than you think)**

Your abundance blocks aren't just about positive thinking. They're neurological patterns formed in childhood. If you grew up hearing ""money doesn't grow on trees"" or watching your parents stress about bills, your brain literally wired itself for scarcity. This isn't woo woo stuff, it's how neural pathways work.

The book *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel (a Wall Street Journal bestselling author and former columnist) breaks this down brilliantly. This book will make you question everything you think you know about wealth and abundance. Housel shows how our money behaviors are shaped way more by psychology than by intelligence or education. The insights about how personal history creates financial blind spots are insanely good. It's less about manifestation and more about understanding why your brain sabotages abundance in the first place.

Start tracking your scarcity thoughts for one week. Every time you think ""I can't afford that"" or ""that's too expensive,"" write it down. You'll be shocked how often scarcity runs your mental programming. Then practice reframing, not with fake positivity but with questions like ""how could I afford this?"" or ""what would need to happen for this to be possible?"" This shifts your brain from closed to open mode.

**Step 3: Build proof through micro wins**

Your subconscious doesn't believe in things it hasn't experienced. This is why affirmations alone don't work. You can say ""I am wealthy"" a thousand times, but if your bank account says otherwise, your brain calls bullshit.

Instead, create tiny evidence that abundance is real in your life. Did you find a dollar on the street? That's evidence. Did someone buy you coffee? Evidence. Got a refund you forgot about? More evidence. Your brain learns through pattern recognition. When you actively notice small abundances, you're literally training your neural networks to spot opportunity instead of lack.

The app Finch (a self care pet app that's weirdly addictive) has a gratitude feature that helps build this habit. You log small wins daily and your little bird companion grows stronger. Sounds silly but the gamification actually works to rewire your attention toward what's working in your life.

**Step 4: Understand the reticular activating system**

Here's the neuroscience part. Your brain has a filter called the RAS that decides what information gets through to your conscious awareness. Right now, it's probably set to scan for problems and threats because that's what kept humans alive for millennia. But you can reprogram it.

When you clearly define what abundance looks like FOR YOU (not Instagram's version), your RAS starts filtering for opportunities that match. This isn't magic, it's selective attention. You've always experienced this with cars. The moment you decide you want a red Honda, suddenly you see red Hondas everywhere. They were always there, your brain just wasn't looking for them.

Write down your abundance criteria in specific detail. Not just ""I want money"" but ""I want to earn $X doing Y type of work that feels Z way."" The specificity gives your RAS clear search parameters.

**Step 5: Stop waiting for permission**

Most people don't lack abundance because of the universe or bad luck. They lack it because they're waiting for someone to give them permission to want more, to charge more, to take up space. This is especially true if you grew up in environments where ambition was seen as greedy or selfish.

The podcast *We Can Do Hard Things* with Glennon Doyle has an episode on this that hit me like a truck. She talks about how we're taught to make ourselves small, especially around money and success. The episode on abundance versus scarcity mindset breaks down how seeking permission is just another form of self sabotage. It's raw, honest, and doesn't sugarcoat the internal work required.

Practice making decisions without consulting others first. Start small. Buy the fancy coffee without asking if you ""deserve"" it. Take the parking spot closest to the store. These sound insignificant but they're training wheels for bigger abundance decisions.

**Step 6: Fix your tolerance for receiving**

You can manifest opportunities all day long but if you can't receive them, they'll slip through your fingers. This shows up as downplaying compliments, refusing help, feeling guilty about success, or self sabotaging right when things start working.

Your nervous system has a set point for how much good you can handle before it feels dangerous. If abundance wasn't safe in your childhood (maybe success meant jealousy or criticism), your body will literally create chaos to return to familiar discomfort.

The Insight Timer app has tons of somatic meditations specifically for expanding your capacity to receive. The ones by Tara Brach on worthiness are particularly powerful. You're basically teaching your nervous system that safety and abundance can coexist.

BeFreed is an AI learning app from Columbia alumni that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans around your specific goals. If you're working on abundance mindset or any personal growth goal, you can tell it exactly what you're struggling with, and it builds a structured plan tailored to you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples and context when something really clicks. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. It's been useful for internalizing concepts from all the psychology and neuroscience research mentioned here without having to read dozens of books cover to cover.

Do this consistently and you'll notice you stop unconsciously pushing opportunities away.

**Step 7: Take aligned action (not just busy action)**

Manifestation without action is hallucination. But here's the thing, frantic hustling isn't the answer either. You need aligned action, which means doing things that actually move the needle toward your specific abundance goals.

Most people stay busy to feel productive while avoiding the scary actions that would actually change their situation. Posting on social media feels like work. Having the uncomfortable money conversation with a client? That's the actual work.

Make a list of high leverage actions, the 20% of activities that create 80% of your results. For most people, this includes asking for raises, raising prices, pitching yourself for opportunities, having money conversations, learning high income skills, or building systems. These feel uncomfortable because they're unfamiliar, but discomfort is just your nervous system encountering something new, not dangerous.

**Step 8: Audit your abundance leaks**

You might be manifesting abundance but also hemorrhaging it through unconscious patterns. These leaks look like undercharging for your work, saying yes to things that drain you, staying in environments that reinforce scarcity, surrounding yourself with people who criticize success, or spending money to fill emotional voids.

The book *Die With Zero* by Bill Perkins (a hedge fund manager who's actually interesting) will completely shift how you think about abundance. It's not just about accumulating wealth, it's about optimizing life experiences and understanding that abundance includes time, energy, and joy, not just money. The framework for thinking about life seasons and resource allocation is brilliant. This might be the best book on abundance I've ever read that doesn't mention manifestation once.

Track where your energy, time, and money go for two weeks. Be honest about what's actually serving your abundance and what's sabotaging it. Then ruthlessly cut or renegotiate the leaks.

The real tea? Manifesting abundance isn't about vision boards and affirmations. It's about rewiring deep neural patterns, expanding your nervous system's capacity for good things, taking strategic action, and fixing the invisible leaks in your system. The universe isn't withholding abundance from you. Your own programming is. Change the programming, change the results.",1,1768005450.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1q8pi1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1q8pi1o/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1q8pfr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscussionZone/comments/1q8pfr6/will_hispanics_and_muslims_will_inherit_the_earth/,Will Hispanics and Muslims will inherit the Earth?,"Here’s my reason for asking: They are the last two cultures that have manifested, through the passage of time, an unceasing reproductive flow, regardless of political, cultural, or economical factors.

Each for different reasons. Let’s start with the Hispanics. I can speak confidently on this because I am a hybrid Hispanic/white.

Colombians, Venezuelans, Caribbean islanders, Central Americans, etc.—all the Native American DNA mixed with Spanish/Italian/Mediterranean DNA, with a sprinkle of African due to the intermingling during the Spanish conquest of the Americas.

These people are still shamelessly HORNY. They’re about as horny as the blacks, but with the subtle European courting habits that create a romantic buffer period between attraction and actual intercourse. These people come from countries that are mostly 1st world, some still 2nd world countries partly, but generally speaking, they REPRODUCE whether they are in the U.S. or in their own country, poor or rich, low status or high.

They don’t wait until they are economically stable. They don’t face social ostracization or isolation when a woman gets pregnant either. They don’t even make a big deal when they get pregnant like white women. It’s like just another “thing” that happens to them. Their psychological genetic programming doesn’t run the whole tragically complex thing through their minds like white women; they just accept motherhood as a matter of fact, as a simple process.

They live in packs, in communities—cousins, 10 siblings, uncles, aunts. Everyone lives interconnected daily or almost daily, even if they aren’t in the same physical house. They have a huge safety net financially and socially because of how they OPERATE. They operate like a unit. Someone’s always pregnant. Everyone works around it and picks up slack where it’s needed. They accept the communal changes quickly because of their pro-social genetics.

The white woman cannot do this. The mind virus that has infected the West has isolated her into individuality, into psychologically fending for herself if pregnancy occurs. They don’t have family constantly around them. She usually just has the man, and visitations around the strict work schedule, maybe from the parents.

Hell, let’s start with the fact that most white women don’t even want a kid to begin with, cuz it’s less “fun” to have a kid than to be an independent woman in the modern world, because of all the Netflix series she’s seen about 30+ year old women living these wildly meaningful single lives, as if that were anything other than a fiction to 99.99% of regular women.

The Hispanic woman? She was born to reproduce. She doesn’t even stop partying if she has a kid. She brings the kids to the party. All these Hispanics do is party. Tons of kids and they’re all still sexy. She doesn’t stop “feeling sexy” after a kid somehow, like white women. They all literally somehow look the same after several kids. Hispanic women know her sexual value pretty much remains even after pregnancy in the Hispanic world because of how easy and horny Hispanic men are. It’s just how it is. So she can financially AND socially AND sexually afford a kid—multiple, even. Hispanics switch partners like shoes every few years anyways. It’s just how it is.

White women? They don’t have this genetic programming. She is programmed for either total pair bonding, or for total isolation from reproductive behavior altogether. They will literally short wire their genetic neural circuitry and become insane and anti-social after a certain amount of partners. And after a kid, her options become limited because of how serious the white brain becomes with age due to serotonin deficiencies. The sexual and serotonergic pathways cannot sustain tenderness and vitality like the sexual ferocity of the Hispanic Latina after her first birth to a child. They just aren’t wired that way genetically or socially.

Also, Hispanics are just more multi-dimensional in their emotional expressions and overall acceptance of the human condition. Men are permitted socially to have a more feminine aspect to their personality. They are allowed to be expressive without losing their man card in other men’s and women’s eyes. They are allowed to express emotions—even tender and motherly traits. They don’t have to chew nails and ash cigarettes in their coffee to be men.

It’s not like the white men in white culture, where you have to be hard and stoic and boring as fuck and focus on nothing outside of absolute practicality. The flow of conversation in Hispanic culture is always accepting of men as being equally tender and emotional as women are, and vice versa.

Women are seen as matriarchal strongholds and are respected as WOMEN without them having to succeed or perform as MEN do.

Due to these very real factors, the Hispanic community will outproduce the white. It’s just evolutionary pressures winning out in a game of social and genetic factors and numbers. Hispanics GO HARD with the sexual culture well into older age.

Whites are becoming logical and cold and isolated psychologically due to the changing of times and economy and loss of identity, and the integration of diverse genetics into the societal ecosystem who are out breeding them.

Of course, these are generalities. There are tons of white women who fit into the other side of the coin, and Hispanic women who fit into the opposite camp. These are GENERALITIES. The majority within the bell curve fit into this model. The outliers clearly don’t apply.

Now, Muslims. Completely different reason they will outproduce everyone, just like the Hispanics.

They have a culture that is designed for the maximization of the family unit and child bearing. It’s a very intentional process that is bound to religion and culture. And men have multiple wives in their traditional homelands mostly, and reproduce incredibly quick with their wives—several children each.

Not only this, but they are dominating African and European territory and have an insatiable drive toward preservation of identity and survival of their own heritage, something whites have quite literally abandoned within themselves to the point of suicidal dissolution.

The Muslims are impenetrable in their ways. The men are extremely tight knit and familial and emotionally expressive (feminine) with each other without being seen as unmanly. In fact, the love between men in platonic and familial ways is greater than almost any other culture I’ve seen, followed closely by the Hispanics.

They aren’t going anywhere because they have pride and are ride or die for their own.

I assumed I should have minimum astringency from my cup because I used zp6, weak agitation, and bypass water.

1q8peg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q8peg4/i_went_to_record_a_demo_with_my_band_in_the/,"I Went to Record a Demo With My Band in the Mountains, But We Encountered Something Strange on the Road.","Hello everyone. I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between some old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \*Transylvanian Hunger\*. 

The underground latched onto it immediately, and it became the kind of demo that was traded heavily. Rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people or addressed the rumors; we just let the myth become as much a part of the legacy as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like a marionette’s, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintain perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov, didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. 

Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found an article online regarding a place we should go record at. I remember that day vividly because rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band, let alone this one, is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windshield. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the van boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of the van. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing the van to fishtail. The van’s tires screamed against ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils caught the van’s headlights before locking onto me. I didn’t have time to react. One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like it were made out of paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior of the van causing the others and I to shudder.

I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below as I looked to my left and right. It was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear like a spider to a wall. Gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from the van navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to our van noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds, ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van and got settled in as Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and the van surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back.

I can extremely nervous in new situations regardless of my experience of things. Just for context, I was so shy that I didnt talk for 4 years in high school. I forced myself without medication in college to socialized. 

I was able to successfully get myself out of anxiety and I have came a long way. I started going on dates when I was 22 and I failed miserably. I eventually got my first kiss at 25 and my first girlfriend at 27. I am so confident that I can go to bars by myself and cold approach strangers. 

In fact on NYE, I was able to keep a convo going with a girl and got her to meet me for coffee. 

Even though I did all of that, I still struggle to communicate. People always ask what did I say. My words run together and I struggle to be convincing. I get my anxious even when talking to friends 1on1. 

If I had to described my anxiety. It likes a discomfort in my belly that eventually radiates to my head. Once it is in my head, I can't think. I start to forget things easily and I stutter. The up side is that the more I am exposed, the symptoms disappear. However, they reappeared again with a new situation. 

For example, I can talk to women now. But I still struggle being good at texting. I can talk to strangers but I struggle to connect. Its a weird balance to be at. 

  
Im only reaching out because I am in my IM rotation in med school. Unfortunately my stuttering causes the docs to think I am stupid which only makes my anxiety heighten. Even now, I have a headache and it is hard to return to baseline. I didnt even struggle talking to other patients. So idk why it randomly is happening now?

I pushed the lid. My hands felt solid. Flesh, fingernails, veins. Still me. Still alive. Outside, the chapel hummed like it had a pulse of its own. People cried, nodded, whispered. Nobody looked at me.

I climbed out. Flowers leaned in weird angles. Candles melted upward. My suit itched in places that didn’t exist before. Someone handed me a pamphlet: Order of Service. Photos of me on vacations I’d never taken. Letters from strangers.

I waved. Nobody waved back. My cousin whispered, It’s okay, you’re finally at peace. I wanted to scream, but my voice came out as a fax machine grinding paper. The choir sang. The organ groaned sideways. Even the priest blinked in slow motion, like time had given up.

Outside, streets were empty except for shadows shaped like me, mimicking my steps. My phone buzzed: You’ve been very quiet. Don’t ruin the funeral. I blinked at the screen. The notifications kept coming: photos of me sleeping, text messages I never sent, all tagged #GoneButNotForgotten.

By the end of the day, someone left a note in my mailbox: You’ll get used to being invisible. Everyone already has. My neighbors called twice, asking why I hadn’t answered at my own funeral. I stared at the number and hung up.

For the past 3 weeks I am going to job fairs held by fast food places, restaurants or coffee shops.

This restaurant is hiring for its 3 locations and I see them posting job fairs on Craigslist pretty often. I went there early and was still waiting 2 hours and the manager was so vague with the interview. I checked Craigslist and they are having another job fair next week!

This past Christmas (2025) she arrived with the pervious Christmas' missing gift and proclaimed ""i remembered this year"" my husband replied ""cool ill just have double gifts this year"" . Wrong, very wrong. I got yet another stupid mug, I dont drink coffee. He got one gift, the gift she forgot the previous year. We know its not about the gifts, we dont care about that anyway but she didnt even get him a new gift and she even said it was from the previous year. 

  
Ok now to the gift. It was a hoodie for a favorite football team, however it was 3 sizes too small and barely fits me. This happens every year and I dont know how to approach the subject. It is very obvious the size issue and I am honestly tired of playing it off year after year. If I confront her about the issue AITA? I really just want to send our adult sizes when she asks for our kids sizes. This year she didnt even do that and she got my oldest a shirt 2 sizes too small also so I really dont want this trend to continue . 

  
Husband doesn't want to say anything but its getting a little old and sad for him since his mom doesn't know his size. She also does not keep the tags on the items or give receipts, even though you can absolutely tell they are new

I did however just get a brand new \[Ceado E6C\] grinder from Whole Latte Love yesterday, which leads me to my question: When I went to test run it, I noticed it was making more sounds than just the motor whir (without beans).  The motor is making a sort of ""ticking"" sound as it spins, but by the looks of it, is seems as though it is spinning freely. The sound abates a little when I cover the bellows, but I didn't try running any beans through it yet. I haven't been able to reach anyone at WLL yet due their hours any my work schedule today, however I'll try to see if I can reach someone tomorrow. I've had a number of various grinder over the years, but none that quite sound like this, so I don't know if I should be worries or concerned.

If there is anyone else out there who has this grinder could chime in as to if this is ""normal"" or not that would be great. If it is normal, I'm not sure how I feel about that, although I'm sure the sound would be relatively unnoticeable when grinding beans.

1q8p9fr,https://i.redd.it/vzx29xnp1fcg1.jpeg,What lighting works best in a remodeled kitchen?,"# Start with how you use the space

Good kitchen lighting does more than make the room look nice. It shapes how the space feels and functions every day. The best remodels combine task, ambient, and accent lighting in layers so you can prep food, host friends, and relax afterward.

The right lighting plan turns your kitchen into both a chef’s workspace and your home’s centerpiece.

# 1. Task lighting: where the work happens

Task lighting provides bright, focused light in areas where you need it most. Many homeowners rely only on ceiling cans, which leaves dark spots and harsh shadows on the counters.

A better setup includes:

* Undercabinet LED strips for clear visibility while cooking
* Pendant lights hung about 30 to 36 inches above the island for both style and brightness
* Recessed LED cans with adjustable angles over sinks and prep zones

Aim for a color temperature around 3000K. It feels warm yet clean and gives your kitchen a welcoming glow.

# 2. Ambient lighting: the comfortable base layer

Ambient light fills the room evenly and creates an overall sense of comfort. It connects the task zones with the rest of the space and prevents harsh contrasts.

Try these ideas:

* Dimmable recessed lights across the ceiling for balanced coverage
* A decorative central fixture if you have higher ceilings
* Soft cove lighting above cabinets to bounce light off the ceiling

Always install dimmers. You’ll want bright light for prep and a softer mood for dinner or evening cleanup.

# 3. Accent lighting: highlighting your favorite features

Accent lights make your remodel feel intentional. They draw attention to the special design details you chose, such as a backsplash, open shelves, or decorative range hood.

Some options are:

* Puck lights inside glass cabinets
* LED tape lighting under floating shelves or along toe kicks
* Small spotlights to highlight artwork or texture

Accent lighting adds warmth and depth, making your kitchen feel more like a high-end space than a workspace.

# 4. Why professional lighting design matters

Homeowners often underestimate how technical lighting can be. Fixture type, placement, ceiling height, and wall colors all affect the final look. A professional design-build team plans these details early, so you know exactly how the lighting will perform before construction begins.

At Phoenix Home Remodeling, our designers include lighting layout and 3D renderings in the design phase so homeowners can visualize brightness, tone, and balance before installation. It prevents surprises and ensures the lighting works perfectly with the overall design.

If you want to see how the process ties lighting, cabinetry, and finishes together, this guide explains it clearly: [https://phxhomeremodeling.com/remodel-process/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=phr-subreddit](https://phxhomeremodeling.com/remodel-process/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=phr-subreddit).

The best kitchen lighting isn’t one single fixture. It’s a combination of task, ambient, and accent light that creates beauty, comfort, and function in every corner. Plan your lighting early, use dimmers, and keep the color temperature consistent across all fixtures. Done right, your remodeled kitchen will feel bright, inviting, and ready for anything from morning coffee to dinner with friends.",4,1768004726.0,Phoenixhomeremodeling,0,1.0,False

Everything changed when we discovered who we really were.,"It was midnight when I stumbled into our office, two lukewarm coffees in hand.

Well, not exactly ‘our’ office.

Middleview North University didn’t recognize us as a real club. 

Apparently, “Investigative newspaper” didn’t cut it. 

When we pleaded our case to the dean, he relented and let us use the storage closet on the third floor of the arts building. 

Small victories. 

At the back of my mind, I knew exactly why we weren’t being taken seriously. 

We hadn’t solved one mystery. Our whole shtick was, “We will take any case!” Whether it’s small, like a cheating partner, or big like a kidnapping. 

We promised to solve them all. And then, we didn't.

After fumbling almost all of our cases, we had one last chance to prove ourselves.

This time, with a real mystery.

Four months ago, two 19 year old male MNU students went missing.

The only thing left behind was their right shoes. We were stumped. 

The local police were useless, so we took it upon ourselves to prove we weren’t just loser college kids trying to be Scooby Doo rejects.

As expected, the storage closet was the size of a prison cell—or maybe that was being generous.

The three of us managed to squeeze in a desk and a chair, and I still felt like I was stepping into Narnia every time I entered. 

Above my head, an old chandelier swung from a broken chain, like any day, it would fail like we had and come crashing down. 

I wanted to ask why a storage closet had a chandelier, but I had a feeling the answer would give me a migraine. 

Tonight was no different than any other. I was exhausted after spending my day off in the library researching the town’s local history. 

I gave up when my phone became too tempting, and I started doomscrolling TikTok. I only snapped out of it when a guy from one of my classes, sitting across from me, started talking about the missing boys. 

He asked me about the case, and I just shrugged and said, “We’re working on it.”

We were, in fact, *not* working on it. The police had already issued us a cease and desist, so we had no access to reports.

All we had was the tiny office we called home. Kicking off my shoes, I ducked inside, clutching the coffees to my chest. 

Only two people were allowed inside at once, due to safety hazards or whatever. 

The university really would rather we suffocate than give us actual damn space.

“I hope you like slightly warm coffee,” I said, squeezing into the closet.

“You’re late,” a voice grumbled from inside.

Piled on top of our desk were a laptop and a pile of unsolved cases. Sitting hunched over his MacBook sat Aris Caine, his squinty eyes illuminated in the sharp, fluorescent glow from our Ikea lamp.

Disheveled as usual, glasses perched atop thick blonde curls, hair a tangled mess hanging in overshadowed eyes. He’d spent all day running his hands through it. I knew him far too well.

He only took off his glasses when he was pissed or figured something out. I prayed for the latter.

For a British exchange student who exclusively wore sweater vests and spoke like a walking thesaurus, he was a prickly asshole. But he was also incredibly smart. Stupid smart.

“There was a line,” I lied, setting his (cold) coffee in front of him. 

In actuality, I had bumped into a group of “fans” who reminded me that we were useless. 

But of course I didn’t tell him that, instead offering Aris a smile and nudging his coffee toward him. 

I noticed his stance, furrowed brow, folded arms and leg jiggling, like he couldn’t wait to tell me something. Or maybe he just really had to pee.

It reminded me of when we first met, when we both signed up to edit the college newspaper; which was perhaps the only time I’d seen him smile. 

Aris only smiled when he had something tangible worth smiling about, which piqued my curiosity. I knew Aris like he knew me. Something was bothering him. 

And naturally, that asshole had wanted to wait for me to come back to gauge my reaction in person, instead of texting me a goddamn heads up.

I sipped my coffee while I tried my best to psychoanalyze him.

“You haven’t found them,” I hummed around the rim of my coffee cup. Ugh. The coffee tasted like burnt mildew. “But you’re getting closer?”

Aris simply cocked an eyebrow and turned his laptop around. I peered at the screen, a photo of a group of smiling kids.

It was an article from 2013 detailing Middleview’s Boy Scouts raising money for town hall renovations.

“Boy Scouts?” I murmured, leaning closer. I shot him an eyebrow right back. “Dude, I’m too tired to understand your brain.”

Aris’s lips pricked. “The cops said the guys had no connection,” he rolled his eyes.

He leaned forward and prodded the screen. “But, as you can see, both of them were in the 2013 Boy Scouts.” Aris traced the faces of the missing boys. 

“Which means, at some point, both of these boys have visited a Middleview resident.” He grabbed a printout and slapped it down in front of me. “They did these bake sales every year.” He explained. “I bet their kidnapper bought cookies from them.”

I scanned the article. “Hmm. So, the kidnapper targeted former Boy Scouts they bought cookies from?”

Aris shook his head, rocking back in his chair. His eyes found the ceiling. “I’m not there yet, Nancy Drew. May is pinpointing every resident who was a regular.”

My head jerked up. “You’re not serious.”

“If they bought cookies, we’re visiting them,” Aris muttered, massaging his temples like *he* was the one with a headache.

He groaned, tipping his head back and pinching between his brows. “What be their motive, though? That is what is so… logically indefensible.”

“It’s late, Aris,” I whined. “Can you please be NORMAL, for once?”

I mulled the information around in my head, kneeling uncomfortably on the cold wood floor in front of the desk.

No chairs, no beanbags. I drained my coffee as Aris sipped his own, made a face, and plonked his back down.  “But, why wait years to take them?” I pondered.  

“Why wait until they grew up?”

“Loneliness!”

An all-too-familiar voice startled me. Aris, as usual, was unperturbed, leaning further back in his chair.

May Lee, our third and final member, stuck her head through the door, bright orange hair igniting under the light. 

Korean American with the look of a runway model, May did not fit with us. 

That’s what I thought, at least. 

Don’t judge a book by its cover. 

When she showed up at our door donning a strawberry purse, skater dress, and a full notebook of suspects for our missing statue case, I couldn't take her seriously. 

Neither could Aris. In fact, our very own Sam Spade told her to fuck off. 

That was, until we found ourselves tied up in an old man’s basement, and it was that girl with the kitten heels who saved us from becoming Middleview’s next mystery.

But now, normally talkative May was strangely silent as she squeezed through the door. 

I took a moment to notice May was in pajamas, her hair still wrapped up in a towel. 

She held up her phone. “I’ve been on the phone with the former Boy Scout leader, and after a slight maybe-bribe, he gave me all of his customers' names. Past and present. And there were a lot of people.”

Aris raised a brow. “What did you bribe him with, may I ask?”

“That’s not important right now,” she rolled her eyes, speaking in a tangled rush of what I liked to call May Babble. “Anyway, to cut a long story short, after going through each customer, there was only ever one person who bought cookies every year.” 

May’s eyes found mine. “Jenny Pearson. 56 years old. She spent thousands of dollars on them. Like, she was OBSESSED.”

I nodded slowly, picking up on her words. “So, this is revenge?” I said. “For shitty cookies?”

“Perhaps they poisoned her?” Aris offered, cupping his chin. “Boy scout cookies are unfavorably mundane.”

May shook her head. “No. You've both been looking at this case from a perspective of malice. Jenny lost both of her teenage sons a year ago in a car crash,” she said. “Both of whom—”

Aris jumped up, his eyes wide. “Would be nineteen right now.”

May nodded grimly, folding her arms across strawberry-themed pajamas. 

“Loneliness,” she reiterated. “This woman lost her sons. So, what if she took two boys who were just like them? Two boys, whom she knew. Who she’d been buying cookies from since they were little kids.”

That would be the moment when any other trio of ragtag college detectives would… I don’t know, call the cops?

But this was our last chance to prove ourselves, a real kidnapping case with an actual criminal.

We’d spent our freshman year dealing with catnapping and missing statues, and this was an actual crime.

May insisted she was a lonely woman who was grieving, but there was a big difference between healthy grieving and kidnapping two nineteen-year-olds to replace her sons. It only took one look between us, and we were falling out of our closet-office faster than May could call us an Uber. 

Taking two steps down the stairs at a time, Aris was already ordering us around. 

“May, what’s the address?” he panted as we pushed through automatic doors and into the moonlit night.

Our Uber was already there, waiting. Aris jumped into the back, and I squeezed in beside him. 

He was already buzzing with excitement, almost vibrating in his seat, so much that May elbowed him. “Marin. I need the boys' names,” he said, snapping his fingers.

I pulled out my notebook, scanning my barely cohesive shorthand, grateful for the orangeade glow of passing lampposts.

“Prestley,” I said, squinting at the names. “Prestley and Beck.”

Aris’s head shot up. “Where have I heard that name before? Beck.”

His question hovered in the air like spoiled milk during a ten-minute drive where I was sweating, far too aware that we were actively interfering with a police investigation. 

Would this go on my permanent record? 

Mom made it pretty clear when I was hauled into the station for the third time that it would be the last time she would bail me out. 

The cops said this was our last chance—the next time we were caught, the three of us would be tried as adults. 

In my excitement, I kind of forgot about that part.  

A quick glance at Aris Caine, my partner in crime, whose expression was set in cartoonish determination, and I bit back a groan. 

Suddenly, the idea of confronting an actual kidnapper wasn’t such a good idea.

Once the adrenaline and dopamine rush had crashed and burned, I was left nauseous, and actually really fucking terrified I was going to die. My clammy hands dipped into my lap.

To distract myself, I stared out the window, watching the late-night traffic zip by in an aurora of cyberpunk colors. `

When we pulled up outside a regular suburban home, I really started rethinking my life choices.

Aris tilted his head, his eyes fixed on the “welcome home!” sign on the front door. 

He shoved his hands into his jacket pockets. 

Aris was the only one dressed appropriately for the occasion, in a sensible fur-coated jacket. It wasn’t a secret that his family was wealthy, but Aris wasn’t one to brag. 

“I was expecting a house of horrors,” he hummed. “This place belongs in a Hallmark movie.”

May, shivering and jumping up and down in her pajamas, nudged him. “Hallmark horror movies exist, y’know.”

“Let’s think about this,” Aris said, as it became clear we were just three college kids completely out of our depth standing on a random suburban street at 1am.

I dazedly watched my breath dance in front of me in white wisps.

Aris stared at Jenny Pearson’s house across the street. He was doing that thing again where he calculated everything in his mind, every possible escape route and every obstacle.

After a full minute of zoning out, swaying back and forth, and most importantly, not speaking, he finally turned to us. 

Aris had a plan. But from the look on his face, we were not going to like it. 

“I think I’ve got it,” he said. 

“So this woman kidnaps guys like her sons, right?” he hissed excitedly, zipping up his jacket. 

“So, I’ll knock and innocently ask if I can use her phone, she lets me in, and…bingo. I search the place, grab the guys, drag them out of the murder house, and we all go and grab coffee together.”

His grin was typical. 

Of course, Aris Caine was putting himself in unnecessary danger. He was just that kind of guy.

I already hated his plan.

May, of course, was against it.

“Are you serious?” she hissed. “You want to intentionally get kidnapped to prove she’s the kidnapper?” She rolled her eyes, “or we could just go over like three normal people and *ask* her.”

Aris laughed loudly. 

We were already attracting unwanted attention just by standing there. 

I shot him a warning glare, but of course he kept going because Aris Caine had to be right. 

“Oh, sure, that won’t ring any alarm bells.” Aris’s accent thickened with sarcasm. 

“Hi, lady! Sorry to bother you,” he said, mocking May’s squeaky voice. I bit my lip to hold back a smirk. “But are you keeping two nineteen-year-old students captive?” 

He turned to May, his lips curling. “I’m sure Mrs. Pearson will be completely honest with us.”

“I don’t sound like that,” May muttered.

“I know,” he sent her a rare teasing smile. “I was exaggerating for comedic effect.” 

Aris sighed. “Look, I know you don’t like it, but it looks less suspicious than three well-known detectives turning up.” He coughed. “I can also do a passable American accent that she’ll totally believe.”

“And what if *you* are taken too?” I hissed, blowing into my hands to keep them warm. “We have zero idea what state these guys are in and what she’s done to them—” I caught myself before I could let my emotions get the better of me. 

But they always won. “What if they’re dead?” I caught Aris’s raised eyebrow. “Even worse, what if she’s torturing them, like right now?”

Aris shot me a look. He folded his arms. “Marin, she’s a fifty-year-old mother,” he said, “not exactly Hannibal Lecter.”

“May I remind you both that Hannibal Lecter was really polite?” May hissed, hugging me for warmth. “Serial killers are actually known to be super chill! He ate with a handkerchief!”

Aris’s lip quirked. “You mean the *fictional* cannibal, Hannibal Lecter?”

May squeaked. “That’s not—”

“Yes it is,” he mused. “You’re talking about the TV show.”

“Shut up,” I hissed, noticing a window flicker behind us. The owner was watching. 

Which meant we had to make a decision.

I turned to Aris, a bad feeling already writhing in my gut. I had a choice. 

Let Aris sacrifice himself or get us all arrested. “Ten minutes,” I told him. “If you’re in there for a second longer, we’ll call the police, and all three of us are fucked.” Unable to stop my wandering hands, I fiddled with his hair in an attempt to hide his face. 

Aris squirmed, batting my hands away. Two months since we broke up; since I said we weren’t working.

He cared more about solving cases than about me. But that was okay because so did I. 

We were both stubborn, inexperienced introverts with a shared obsession with solving mysteries.

Of course we didn’t work. Opposites attract, but Aris and I repelled.  

Still, I cared for him more than I should.

I tucked a talkie into his pocket. “Use this when you can,” I said. “Don’t bother with pleasantries, and whatever you do, don’t accept any food or drink.”

“If she has weapons or you suspect any weird shit, get out of there,” May said, slapping him on the back.

“Relax,” Aris wasn’t a hugger, but he did bury his head in my shoulder. 

I appreciated his warmth, his proximity, which meant he was actually *trying*, his shuddery breaths dancing across the nape of my neck. I wanted him to stay longer before he pulled away and offered a two-fingered salute. “I’ll be fine!” he insisted. “I *promise* I won’t become a pod person.”

“Ten minutes,” I hissed before he darted across the road.

I couldn’t resist jumping to my feet. “Say it, Aris!” I whispered. “Ten minutes!”

“Ten minutes!” he hissed back, twisting around, his eyes sharp, lips curled. “Hide!”

I grabbed May, pulling her safely behind a car with me. I watched from a distance, scrutinizing every facial expression when the front door opened, revealing a middle-aged woman sticking her head out—purple hair and a bright green knitted sweater. 

Not what I was expecting. 

The woman didn’t seem defensive or suspicious, settling Aris with a warm smile. She didn’t *look* like a criminal mastermind. May passed me a pair of binoculars, and I focused on her facial expressions. Looking behind her, all I saw was a painting on the wall.

Aris stayed calm and collected, delivering his lines exactly as we rehearsed them. 

“Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but I’m pretty lost. Can I use your phone to call someone? Mine is dead.”

Jenny Pearson’s lips broke out into a grin, and I caught May’s side-eye. She must have thought it was Christmas.

“Oh, of course!” Jenny Pearson sang, and my hands grew clammy around the binoculars. “Do you have any friends with you?”

Fuck.

May let out a hiss next to me. I wasn’t expecting that.

Neither was Aris, judging by his response. “Uh, no,” he said, maintaining his performance.  “No, it’s just me.”

“Well, come on in, sweetheart!” she said. “You can use my landline!”

“Do people even use landlines anymore?” May whispered. “It’s not the 90’s.”

Before I could respond, Jenny ushered Aris through the door and slammed it behind her, sending my heart into acrobatics.

Twenty minutes passed.

“He said ten minutes,” I gritted out. I jumped up, and she gently dragged me back down.

“Give him time,” May said, focusing on the upstairs, while I was glued to the door, mentally praying for the damned thing to fly open and for my idiot ex-boyfriend to come running out, two disheveled guys in tow. “Come on. Wasn’t that what broke you up? You didn’t *trust* each other.” 

She sighed. “You were cute. It sucks that both of you are insufferable.”

“I’m not stubborn,” I lied, exasperated. “He just sucked at being a boyfriend.”

May chuckled. “Which went both ways, you know,” she teased. “You also sucked at being a *girlfriend*.” She turned to me, grinning. “Didn’t you blow him off twice to go solo investigating?”

A warm rush of heat flooded my cheeks. “He did exactly the same thing to me,” I said.”

“Sooo, relationships are a competitive sport now?” May’s judgmental stare was burning a hole in my temple. “Aris scored a touchdown, and you played dirty, tackling him. You didn’t even give him a chance to reclaim the ball, didn't even explain your tackle, and you're both playing for the same team.”

“Sports metaphors?” I hissed, rubbing my eyes.

The Pearson door stayed shut. 

The welcome home sign on the door was beginning to look less like a greeting and more like a threat. “Sports metaphors that don’t even make sense in the middle of a life-or-death situation?”

May groaned. “I feel like my fingers are going to drop off and my butt is numb, so naturally, my brain is a mashed potato right now.” She sighed, adjusting her position to a light crouch.  “Anyway. Aris didn’t mean to blow you off.”

Something visceral erupted in my gut, twisting down my spine, the phantom legs of a spider scuttling along my vertebrae. 

And for a moment, I forgot about the Pearson house, the missing boys, and our stakeout. I twisted to May, my cheeks burning, my tongue in knots. “What?”

“He didn’t mean to blow you off,” May turned back toward the house. 

“That night, when you were on your date, I stupidly decided to confront the idiot who stole the town statue. I had all the evidence, but I didn’t tell you guys because I…” she trailed off. “Let’s just say he’s done this before.” 

She shuffled uncomfortably. “I went over to his dorm room, and after freaking out, he locked me inside.” 

May’s voice cracked. “I called Aris, who was on his way to meet you, and he came straight away.” She sniffled, swiping her nose. “It's dusty out here or something, stupid allergies.”

My voice came out tangled and wrong, suffocating my tongue. “Why didn’t he *tell* me?”

“I told him not to,” she whispered. “I was embarrassed. I didn’t want you to think I was reckless, and at first, he refused because he knew it would look bad. But I managed to convince him.” 

Her lip curled. “I’m actually still doing homework for him. That was part of our deal.”

I found myself laughing, but my heart hurt. I blew him off for nothing. I was unnecessarily cruel for nothing. “You’re both idiots.”

May spun around. “Soo, you’ll talk to him?”

I wasn’t sure if *talk* was the right word.

Maybe *scream*.

“Yeah,” I said, my chest aching. “Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But this doesn’t change anything. He fucks with mysteries, not people,” I couldn’t resist laughing. ""That guy gets off by solving cases. Do you know how many times we had sex? Zero.” 

I rolled my eyes. “Any time we were close, he’d get this weird look in his eyes, and say, 'Holy shit, I’ve got it!' like, he literally had his lightbulb moment right in the middle of making out.”

May burst into giggles. “That’s adorable.” She nudged me. “You loved it, though.” Her smirk caught me off guard. “You still like our boy, don’t you?”

“I don’t,” I said.

I did.

After half an hour, I started to lose circulation in my legs from crouching in the same spot.

Once the forty-five-minute mark had passed, I noticed the upper bedroom window’s curtains were suddenly pulled closed.

May nudged me, still peering through her binoculars. “Do you think we’re wrong?” she whispered. “What if she’s a grieving mother who just happens to like Boy Scout cookies?”

I didn’t take my eyes off the window. “If she’s just lost her sons, why is she closing the curtains to one of their rooms?” I said, “She lives alone, why bother?”

May shrugged. “She still tends to their rooms?”

“Nope,” I muttered, focusing on the front door. My heart started to stumble. “If I were a kidnapper and I just took another victim, the first thing I would do is make sure I have privacy.”

When an hour passed, panic began to creep in.

My hands were numb, my body stiff.  I stood to stretch my legs. I was starting to get restless. “If he’s not out in the next ten minutes, I’m knocking.”

Ten agonizing minutes passed quickly, and I finally stood up, my heart trying to burst from my chest. 

I marched over to the door, May by my side.

“Is this a good idea?” she hissed while I rapped on the door. “Shouldn’t we call the police?”

I jumped back in surprise as the door was yanked open.

“It’s quarter past three in the morning,” Jenny Pearson,  wrapped in a red robe, had a completely different reaction to us. “What on earth do you think you’re doing?”

I had half a mind to shove past her and see for myself. That’s what the cops would do.

Luckily, I had *some* self control.

“Hi there!” I smiled my best smile, trying to look past her. Mrs. Pearson blocked my way. 

“We’re Aris’s friends!” I said brightly. “We were just wondering where he is! He told us he’d be at this address, since his phone died.” 

The second Jenny Pearson’s expression crumpled with faux confusion, I knew this woman was the kidnapper, and she had just added my ex-boyfriend to her ranks of newly adopted sons. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Jenny said. “Goodnight.”

Before she could slam the door on our faces, I tried to barge past her. 

“Let me rephrase myself,” I said. “You have kidnapped two students and just took our friend. We literally watched you welcome him inside your house.” When her expression soured, I smiled, closing the distance between us. “Open the fucking door, or I will *make* you open the fucking door.” 

Jenny’s eyes narrowed, and I knew what she was trying to do. Classic emotional manipulation.

Suddenly, she burst into loud, obvious sobs, trying to draw attention.

“My sons died three years ago,” she whispered. “I live *alone*, if you must know.” 

She emphasized *alone* before delivering the final blow. “Trespassing on my property and demanding to be let in is disgusting. Leave me alone, or I will be forced to call the police.”

May pulled out her phone with a sugary sweet smile. “It’s cool, I already called them,” she said. “They’re on their way.” She stepped forward, feigning innocence. “Mrs Pearson, I know you can’t let us check your home, but I’m sure you’ll let the cops, right?”

She stepped back just as a vivid array of red and blue lights arrived. Two police cars pulled up, one transporting my least favorite officer, Detective Henderson. 

I could already sense his death glare burning a hole in my skull.

But surprisingly, instead of ripping my head off, he turned to a frazzled-looking Mrs. Pearson. 

“Ma’am,” he croaked. 

I could tell he’d just woken up. Sleeping on the job, as per usual. “We’ve got a report of a domestic disturbance. Now, while we’re sure everything is *fine*,” he shot me a seething look, “we were issued a search warrant for this property based upon certain *allegations* made.”

“But—” Mrs Pearson’s protest crumbled when Officer Henderson pushed past her, gesturing the others to follow him.

May and I tried to push our way in, too, but of course, he shoved us back outside. “You two.” He gritted out. “Stay.”

I didn’t realize I was feverishly trying to force my way through an officer’s human barricade until I choked on a sob.

Henderson immediately backed down. He grabbed my shoulders gently. “Hey,” he spoke softly. “What’s going on?”

“Aris is in there!” I managed to get out. “She took him.” 

Suddenly, I was babbling; I couldn’t stop myself. “She’s kidnapping students who are the same age as her dead sons. Beck and Prestley were Boy Scouts when they were kids, and Aris…” I trailed off when he raised a brow.

“He’s the same age as the boys,” I said quickly. “So, naturally, she would go for him too.”

“Uh-huh.” Henderson dragged a hand over his face. We were already on thin ice with him. “And what exactly was Aris doing here in the middle of the night?”

I averted my gaze, avoiding his death-stare. May spoke up, her voice tangled in May-babble.  “Well, there was only one way to figure out if the boys are here—”

Henderson let out a frustrated hiss. “The only way to find out legally is to tell the police!”

When I tried to protest, he spun around. “Marin.” Officer Henderson spoke my name through clenched teeth, as if I were venom under his tongue.

“If this turns out to be nothing, you’re screwed. I’m not just talking about arrest; I mean, I will be personally sending the three of you to a juvenile detention center. Trespassing inside a police station, attempting to steal evidence, and now forced entry?” 

May grabbed my hand, squeezing tight. 

“It’s okay,” she whispered, leaning her head on my shoulder. “He’s okay.” 

But after a full hour of searching, even she was trembling against me.

Henderson finally came out for the final time.

“There’s nothing here,” he announced, and I felt my heart drop into my gut. I lunged forward.

May tried to pull me back, but I shoved her away, my face burning, my hands shaking. I was going to throw up.

“What are you talking about?” I demanded. People were watching, and I was screaming. I was the fucking crazy girl, the unhinged junior detective. “We watched him walk inside three hours ago!”

“She’s right,” May said, her voice teetering on the edge of hysteria. “Aris was here! She let him in!” 

She turned to Mrs Pearson, who was playing the victim act. “You hid them, didn’t you?”

The woman shook her head. “Sweetie, I’m very sorry, but I do not know where your friend is.”

“Then you can check doorbell cameras!” May hissed. “You can do that, right? Someone must have recorded Aris standing there!”

“I’m sure these two are just confused,” Henderson gritted out. “I’ll deal with you two in a minute.” He nodded to Mrs Pearson.

“Apologies for waking you up, ma’am. You have a blessed night, all right?”

No.

Ignoring the flood of officers bleeding out the door, I grabbed May’s hand and dragged her around to the back door.

I couldn’t breathe, my vision was blurry, and my head was spinning around and around. He had to be here, I thought dizzily. He fucking had to be. 

Because what if he *wasn’t*?

May was breathless at my side,  her wide eyes searching.

“You check upstairs,” she hissed to me, diving into the kitchen.

Then the lounge. I surged down the hallway, throwing myself upstairs. I checked each room. 

Empty. Frozen in time. Superhero posters and SAT revision books scattered the floor.

I stood frozen in the doorway, my gaze glued to a photo on the nightstand: a smiling blonde boy with his arms wrapped around a brunette boy.

My breath was sucked from my lungs. 

I blinked rapidly, but it was still there. Aris. I didn’t recognize the brunette, but the two of them wore wide grins, like they knew each other. 

Like they were friends. 

More so, this was a photo of nineteen-year-old Aris. Maybe even older.

Early twenties, judging by his slight stubble.

But how was that possible?

I stumbled forward on shaky legs, reaching for the photo.

“Marin!” May cried from downstairs.

Somehow, I forced my legs to move, stumbling back down the stairs with the photo frame pressed to my chest. I met a panting May halfway, who didn’t speak, only holding something up.

The talkie I’d pushed into Aris’s pocket.

May’s cheeks were sickeningly pale. 

“It was in the kitchen, smashed under the table,” she whispered. Her gaze snapped to the photo frame in my arms. “Are they the sons who died?”

Her words felt like pinpricks. 

“What? No!” I held up the photo. “It’s Aris!” I hissed. “I mean, it’s an older version of him!”

May frowned. “That’s not Aris,” she whispered. “Marin, I’m pretty sure they’re her dead sons.”

“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!” Mrs. Pearson snatched the photo frame from me, and I caught another glance.

Two smiling boys with their arms wrapped around each other, and definitely not a twenty-something-year-old Aris.

“Get out.” Mrs. Pearson spoke through a shuddering breath. 

She snatched the talkie from May. 

“Get out of my house, now!” she screamed, and we were immediately grabbed by officers on standby. “Disrespecting me is one thing, but going through my dead children’s belongings?”

There she goes again with the manipulation tactic.

We had no choice. Not even the argument of “That’s Aris’s talkie” would win over Officer Henderson.

She threw us out of the front door and into the waiting arms of the nearest cop. Then, we were unceremoniously shoved into the back of my favorite policeman’s cruiser.

May was deathly silent while Henderson lounged in the front seat on his phone. 

I leaned over, restless, my heart suffocating in my throat. 

“Our friend is *missing*,” I spoke through my teeth.  “Are you going to fucking *do* something? Because the last time I checked, cops actually do their *jobs*.”

Henderson, as if mocking me, pulled out his notebook, coughing loudly. “Oh, you want me to write a report?”

I resisted the urge to yell. 

Henderson was one of the more tolerable officers who actually spoke to us. But he was still a cop.

“Yes,” I whispered. “I’m officially reporting him missing.”  

Henderson chuckled. “All right!” He held up a fake pen, pulling off a fake lid. 

“Aris Caine,” he pretended to jot down. “Let me see! Nineteen years old. Glasses. Short blonde hair. Reasonably bright. Attitude. Insufferably pretentious.” He chuckled, flipping over a page.

“Not a very good detective. Actively trespasses on police property, and oh, yeah, I forgot. Mr. Caine had already violated a police order at the time of his supposed *disappearance*. Which was when the three of you hatched a genius plan to break into the home of a grieving woman who lost two sons.” He pocketed his phone with a yawn.

“He’s in there,” I said, refusing to let my voice break. “I know he’s in there. She’s hiding them all.”

Henderson twisted around, staring me down. “And exactly where do you expect her to be keeping three adult men against their will?” He laughed. 

“Okay, so, let's just hypothetically say you’re correct,” Henderson mused, flipping through his notepad. “Jennifer Pearson is a kidnapper,” his lip curled. 

“Don’t you think they’d overpower her? You know, three youngsters versus a woman with confirmed bad hip problems.” 

He shrugged when May sent him a questioning look. “Mrs. Pearson isn’t well, physically,” he said. “I can assure you she does not have the upper body strength to restrain anyone in your hypothetical, made up, magical imaginary room.”

“You mean a basement,” I said dryly.

“It’s been a long night, kids,” he said, watching us closely in the mirror. 

“If your friend doesn't come back tomorrow, I’ll submit a report.” Henderson shut off the lights, and before I knew what was happening, we were cruising away from Mrs. Pearson’s house. Away from Aris.

I had an idea.

Not a good idea, but it was an *idea*.

“I’m going to throw up,” I said, lurching forward. 

“Officer Henderson, I’m—” I spat all over the seats and my lap, forcing very lifelike heaving sounds from my lungs. 

May squeaked, playing along, shuffling away from me with a wink. I tumbled out of the car and let him uncuff me. “Just let me throw up on the side of the road,” I pretended to sob. “I hate fucking throwing up in front of people, I can’t stand it, I---”

“Just go,” Henderson growled. “No funny business, alright? Go do your—whatever you need to do and come back. I gotta take you to the station and write up this fuckin’ report.”

I took the opportunity, nodding. “I’ll just be over there,” I hunched over, clutching my stomach. “Urghhh, I think I’ll be a while. I had this, like, really bad-tasting hot dog. And it’s both ends—""

“Just go! I don’t need details!” I stumbled off as Henderson pulled a face, shooting one last look at May who was biting back a grin.

May, thankfully, immediately worked as a distraction, erupting into a conversation about current affairs.

“So, Officer Henderson,” she mused loudly, “what do you think about Bitcoin?”

His response was a grunt. “What-coin?”

I ran, throwing myself into a sprint before Henderson could notice. Getting back to the Pearson house was easy.

It was getting *in* that would be the hard part. Just as I thought, Henderson pulled up five minutes later looking for me. I ducked behind a trash can. 

After pacing up and down the road for a whole ten minutes, he jumped into his car and sped off in a cloud of exhaust fumes.

Emerging from my hiding spot, I slunk towards the back again, sneaking up the driveway and pink-panthering my way over the wooden gate. 

The back door was locked now, of course. 

But I had a burned metal coil I found on the sidewalk, and a vague memory of my ex-boyfriend whispering, “When in doubt and faced with a locked door, anything will do.” After three frustrating attempts and almost throwing a brick through the damn window, the lock *snicked* open, and I crept inside, pulling out my phone to use as a flashlight.

The kitchen lit up in front of me. Empty. Minimalist. There was a single empty bowl on the table, and an empty cup.

I picked up an apple from the fruit bowl, rolling it around in my hand.

Fake.

I started toward the living room, my flashlight beam illuminating the hallway and staircase. 

“Aris?” I kept my voice a low whisper, ducking into the living room. “Aris, are you in here?”

The television was on, I noticed. The sound was muted, a flickering screen casting light across the room, playing a commercial.

Two shadowy figures sat in front of the television, TV dinners on their laps.

I recognised the tangle of blonde curls and his stupid sweater vest.

I rushed forward, my breath stuck in my throat, but I stopped when Aris’s voice froze me in place.

“Don’t come…” he heaved out a breath. “Don’t come any closer.”

“Is she here?” a gruff voice split through the silence. The second figure was a towering brunette sitting stiffly. I knew him.

From the photo.

And the article.

Prestley. One of the missing boys.

“Yes,” Aris whispered to the boy. “Just… don’t say anything…” his voice was strained, and I couldn’t understand why. Moving closer, the way he was sitting sent shivers trickling down my spine. 

He was upright, but his head lolled onto his shoulder, wide, frightened eyes glued forward. 

“Stupid.”

He jerked suddenly, a cry escaping his lips. “We’ve got maybe five minutes.”

I found my voice. “I’m getting both of you out of here. Whatever she’s done to you—”

I stopped when I saw the back of him, saw his hollowed-out skull. 

Not just his head. 

His entire torso was nothing, just flesh and bone bound together. 

I reached forward to run my hands through his hair, but it was all strings, bloody scarlet slicked string.

“Saffron,” Prestley growled. “That’s the code-word. Tell her before they wipe her again.”

“Eve,” Aris whispered as I staggered back, tripping over myself. “There is no Jenny Pearson, this house—this stage—is empty right now.”

His voice collapsed into white noise, synchronizing with my screams.

“Just… listen to me, okay? Don’t freak out. Listen. When the time comes, you need to remember, all right? Saffron, Eve. You need to remember it.”

But I couldn’t listen.

I couldn’t breathe.

I couldn't stop screaming, blood all over my hands, bloody strings tangled between my fingers—

…

I woke up inside our office closet.

“Hey.”

The voice startled me awake, my head snapping up off our only laptop. I could feel the indentations of the keys pressed into my cheeks. Aris Caine eyed me as I groggily wiped the drool from my lips. 

He stood in front of me, a pensive expression on his face that softened into a tender, somewhat genuine, rare half-smile. 

“Thanks for yesterday,” he fumbled with his hair. “For saving me, or whatever.”

He cleared his throat, taking my hand and running his fingers through my hair, sending shivers up my spine. He leaned closer, his breath tickling the nape of my neck. “I miss us. You know that, right?”

Somehow, we worked like clockwork. I stood and let him sit down, straddling my lap. 

“But I guess you didn’t want me, after all…”

Aris pulled away with a sigh, and I tugged at his hair playfully, forcing his face back to mine. 

His lips found my ear, warm breath tickling the back of my neck. I shivered. 

“I’m *sorry*,” I said, breathless, “was that Aris Caine’s way of *thanking* me?”

Aris chuckled. “It's my way of saying I've been a shitty boyfriend, and being tied up with Prestley for seven hours made me rethink certain *choices*.” 

He kissed me, and I kissed back, warmth spreading through me. “Such as?” I whispered.

He rolled his eyes, adjusting himself on my lap. “Well, next time, I’ll try not to get kidnapped by a psycho.”

A sudden knock on our closet-office door made me jump, sending Aris sprawling. I dived to my feet, straightening my blouse. “Fuck. Is that a client?”

Aris tipped his head back with a groan. “Nope. *Worse*.”

“I know you’re in here,” a voice said from outside.

“Come in,” I said, ignoring Aris’s side-eye. 

The door flung open, a mousy head of reddish-brown curls sticking his head through.

Noah Prestley. The guy we saved, along with Beck and Aris. 

Ever since we pulled him out of that house, the guy was obsessed with us. 

He pulled out his notebook, letterman jacket sliding off one shoulder. “Okay, so I know you guys said you’re not recruiting, but I have like, a ton of possible cases—”

Noah stopped suddenly, his expression going slack. 

He dropped the notepad and slammed the door shut. 

“Saffron?” he whispered to Aris, who nodded, his eyes suddenly dark. 

Glassy. 

I could barely recognize them.

“Saffron.” Aris turned to me with wide eyes, and something cold crept down my spine, my nerve endings igniting. 

He stepped in front of me and gently took my hands, squeezing them, his eyes pleading. 

“Saffron?” ",2,1768004655.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

They are the last two cultures that have manifested, through the passage of time, an unceasing reproductive flow, regardless of political, cultural, or economical factors.

Each for different reasons. Let’s start with the Hispanics. I can speak confidently on this because I am a hybrid Hispanic/white.

Colombians, Venezuelans, Caribbean islanders, Central Americans, etc.—all the Native American DNA mixed with Spanish/Italian/Mediterranean DNA, with a sprinkle of African due to the intermingling during the Spanish conquest of the Americas.

These people are still shamelessly HORNY. They’re about as horny as the blacks, but with the subtle European courting habits that create a romantic buffer period between attraction and actual intercourse. These people come from countries that are mostly 1st world, some still 2nd world countries partly, but generally speaking, they REPRODUCE whether they are in the U.S. or in their own country, poor or rich, low status or high.

They don’t wait until they are economically stable. They don’t face social ostracization or isolation when a woman gets pregnant either. They don’t even make a big deal when they get pregnant like white women. It’s like just another “thing” that happens to them. Their psychological genetic programming doesn’t run the whole tragically complex thing through their minds like white women; they just accept motherhood as a matter of fact, as a simple process.

They live in packs, in communities—cousins, 10 siblings, uncles, aunts. Everyone lives interconnected daily or almost daily, even if they aren’t in the same physical house. They have a huge safety net financially and socially because of how they OPERATE. They operate like a unit. Someone’s always pregnant. Everyone works around it and picks up slack where it’s needed. They accept the communal changes quickly because of their pro-social genetics.

The white woman cannot do this. The mind virus that has infected the West has isolated her into individuality, into psychologically fending for herself if pregnancy occurs. They don’t have family constantly around them. She usually just has the man, and visitations around the strict work schedule, maybe from the parents.

Hell, let’s start with the fact that most white women don’t even want a kid to begin with, cuz it’s less “fun” to have a kid than to be an independent woman in the modern world, because of all the Netflix series she’s seen about 30+ year old women living these wildly meaningful single lives, as if that were anything other than a fiction to 99.99% of regular women.

The Hispanic woman? She was born to reproduce. She doesn’t even stop partying if she has a kid. She brings the kids to the party. All these Hispanics do is party. Tons of kids and they’re all still sexy. She doesn’t stop “feeling sexy” after a kid somehow, like white women. They all literally somehow look the same after several kids. Hispanic women know her sexual value pretty much remains even after pregnancy in the Hispanic world because of how easy and horny Hispanic men are. It’s just how it is. So she can financially AND socially AND sexually afford a kid—multiple, even. Hispanics switch partners like shoes every few years anyways. It’s just how it is.

White women? They don’t have this genetic programming. She is programmed for either total pair bonding, or for total isolation from reproductive behavior altogether. They will literally short wire their genetic neural circuitry and become insane and anti-social after a certain amount of partners. And after a kid, her options become limited because of how serious the white brain becomes with age due to serotonin deficiencies. The sexual and serotonergic pathways cannot sustain tenderness and vitality like the sexual ferocity of the Hispanic Latina after her first birth to a child. They just aren’t wired that way genetically or socially.

Also, Hispanics are just more multi-dimensional in their emotional expressions and overall acceptance of the human condition. Men are permitted socially to have a more feminine aspect to their personality. They are allowed to be expressive without losing their man card in other men’s and women’s eyes. They are allowed to express emotions—even tender and motherly traits. They don’t have to chew nails and ash cigarettes in their coffee to be men.

It’s not like the white men in white culture, where you have to be hard and stoic and boring as fuck and focus on nothing outside of absolute practicality. The flow of conversation in Hispanic culture is always accepting of men as being equally tender and emotional as women are, and vice versa.

Women are seen as matriarchal strongholds and are respected as WOMEN without them having to succeed or perform as MEN do.

Due to these very real factors, the Hispanic community will outproduce the white. It’s just evolutionary pressures winning out in a game of social and genetic factors and numbers. Hispanics GO HARD with the sexual culture well into older age.

Whites are becoming logical and cold and isolated psychologically due to the changing of times and economy and loss of identity, and the integration of diverse genetics into the societal ecosystem who are out breeding them.

Of course, these are generalities. There are tons of white women who fit into the other side of the coin, and Hispanic women who fit into the opposite camp. These are GENERALITIES. The majority within the bell curve fit into this model. The outliers clearly don’t apply.

Now, Muslims. Completely different reason they will outproduce everyone, just like the Hispanics.

They have a culture that is designed for the maximization of the family unit and child bearing. It’s a very intentional process that is bound to religion and culture. And men have multiple wives in their traditional homelands mostly, and reproduce incredibly quick with their wives—several children each.

Not only this, but they are dominating African and European territory and have an insatiable drive toward preservation of identity and survival of their own heritage, something whites have quite literally abandoned within themselves to the point of suicidal dissolution.

The Muslims are impenetrable in their ways. The men are extremely tight knit and familial and emotionally expressive (feminine) with each other without being seen as unmanly. In fact, the love between men in platonic and familial ways is greater than almost any other culture I’ve seen, followed closely by the Hispanics.

They aren’t going anywhere because they have pride and are ride or die for their own.

1q8p70q,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/1q8p70q/help_with_bachelor_of_arts/,Help with Bachelor of Arts,"Hey everyone,

So, I got into the Bachelor of Arts at Usyd but am now having second thoughts about it. For context, I finished high school in 2023, did one year of university study majoring in chemistry (did both in New Zealand) and took last year off uni. 

I’ve always been interested in politics so I originally thought that I would like to major in that and international relations in a Bachelor of Arts. 

However, after looking at the unit outlines for the politics/IR courses at Sydney, it seems like they all involve handwritten, closed book final exams which I really do not like (for context, I did a philosophy unit in 2024 which had the same style of final exam and I barely studied for it) and that the course content seems to be more theory/philosophy based than practical. 

I’ve also been thinking about studying a Bachelor of Commerce because I want something a bit more practical that would help me get a stable job (from what I’ve heard, a BA is a coffee barista degree - please correct me if I’m wrong). 

I was thinking of going to another uni to study a BA or a BA combined with a Bachelor of Commerce but it seems like pretty much all the spots have been filled up, it’s not possible to combine commerce and arts together at these unis, or they’re just too far to commute to for me. 
 
So, these are the options I’m thinking of:
1) Do two papers in semester 1 (currently have GOVT1641 and GOVT1661) to decide whether I like studying politics/IR. 
2) Or go to another uni entirely which has an assessment style I prefer more.

If I go with option 1, here is what I was thinking afterwards:
1) Stay at Usyd and continue studying just a Bachelor of Arts.
2) Stay at Usyd and try to transfer into Commerce/Arts in semester 2 (if possible) or for next year.
3) Stay at Usyd and transfer into a Bachelor Arts and Advanced Studies (from what I’ve read this is the only way to get your two majors on your actual degree certificate when you graduate?).
4) Transfer to another uni after Semester 1 where I can study commerce/arts.

I also got into the Dalyell Scholars program - is that worthwhile or is it just an added stress to keep your marks up? 

Sorry for the long wall of text! I’d appreciate any advice you have. Thanks!",1,1768004559.0,usyd,2,1.0,False

She was in her 90s though and up until last week she was living independently. She had breathing issues and was taken to the hospital a few days ago which ended up being congestive heart failure. That said. It seemed like she was improving and arrangements were made yesterday for when she gets out to go into assisted living. We FaceTimed yesterday and she seemed okay.

She apparently half an hour before “rallied” - which is apparently a thing that occurs. Got hungry and asked for food and coffee- and got it at 11pm from the nurses and a nurse stayed to chat with her and she was apparently friendly and happy. Then she became agitated and blood pressure dropped and she died last night . They called my parents to come, and they were going but she died before they could arrive. It took minutes.

My dad called me to tell me and I just keep hearing him tell me she died. I can’t get how he said it and how he said it out of my head. My mom was also so very upset and crying It was so awful

While she wasn’t doing well it was so shocking to me. I thought we’d get more time to spend and then when the time came to say goodbye. That’s how it happened with my grandpa years ago. I guess I assumed the same would

Happen here.

I am grateful her suffering was not prolonged and overall she seemed to go fast - but I can’t get how my dad sounded to me when he told me and how upset my mom was out of my head.

Curious if this counts as 'worth paying for' in your book

So I’ll admit it: my dating profile photos were garbage. My lighting was bad, my best “candid” was just me squinting at the sun, and my opening messages were… crickets.

I was about to hire a photographer or just give up entirely when I stumbled on this app called [Magnt.app](http://Magnt.app) . The pitch was basically: “AI that makes your selfies look pro and writes your messages for you.” Sounded too good to be true, but I was desperate.

I downloaded it, cringed, and uploaded my most “meh” selfie. Here’s what happened:

**1. The Photo Thing is Weird (But Works)**

You upload a pic, and in like 60 seconds, it fixes the lighting, smooths out my weird bathroom backdrop, and just makes everything look… cleaner? More intentional? It doesn’t change your face, but it makes you look like you know what a good photo is. You can even put yourself in different backgrounds (tried the “NYC street” one as a joke, it was low-key fire). Suddenly my profile didn’t scream “I have no friends to take my picture.”

**2. The “Rizz GPT” Is My Shameful Secret Weapon**

This is the part I’m almost embarrassed to admit I use. You screenshot a match’s profile, and the AI suggests actual opening lines. It reads their bio and everything. I used the “Witty” mode on a girl who had a hiking pic, and it suggested: “Okay, but if we meet for a drink, are you going to suggest we walk there… via the Appalachian Trail?” She replied laughing in 10 minutes. I’m not that clever on demand! It’s saved me from sending “hey” a hundred times.

**3. The Results (The Part You Care About)**

I updated my Hinge and Bumble with three of the AI-polished pics. I’ve been using the message helper when I’m stuck.

It’s been two weeks. My matches have easily \~ **doubled**. My reply rate is way up because the openers are actually good. The algorithm seems to favor the better-quality photos. I’m getting more profile views.

The Bottom Line:

Is it a magic pill? Hell No. You still have to be you, go on dates, etc. But if you’re a normal person with bad photos and dating app anxiety (like me), it levels the playing field HARD. It’s like having a photographer and a wingman in your pocket for the price of a coffee.

It uses a credit system, not a sub, so I just tossed ’em $5 to try it. Worth it for the confidence boost alone.

TL;DR: Was skeptical of an AI dating app. Used it to fix my crappy selfies and write better openers. Matches went up 2-3x. It’s not catfishing, it’s just making your existing profile not suck.",2,1768004522.0,softwaresworthpaying,0,1.0,False

1q8p5lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1q8p5lc/the_parking_lot/,The Parking Lot,"Most likely, yes — it all began with the parking lot. It was twenty years ago. I lived in a small town where I had spent my entire life — nothing unusual for an ordinary man. Until the moment I started coming there at night. Alone.

It was within the city limits. I liked it — or so I thought back then. I’d bring cigarettes, a thermos of coffee, and a radio. A simple curb became something like a home chair to me — a place to sit, to rest, and listen to late‑night stations, escaping the dull noise of daily life.

There, I was completely alone — no people, no cars, even though the parking lot was free. It was lit by yellow buzzing streetlights, surrounded on one side by distant walls and the main road, and on the other — by an endless wasteland with sparse dry grass.

Night after night passed when I began to notice strange things. The local punks avoided this place completely. No drunk yelling, no smashed bottles, no fights. As if they didn’t see the place — or didn’t want to see it. No one ever left their cars there overnight. Sometimes I’d come before sunset and watch people hurry away, as if they instinctively felt that something was wrong here. Fine by me. The quieter, the better.

That evening, after catching a radio signal, I was listening to music from a gone era when I heard a strange noise. Not loud, but clear enough. I turned the volume down and listened. It didn’t seem to come from anywhere, but it sounded like a door left ajar — slamming in the wind, again and again, against the frame.

I turned the radio back up, finished my coffee, and went home to sleep, not giving it much thought.

A week later, I decided to find out what it was. I started walking around the perimeter of the parking lot. Its edges were lost in darkness. The lamps there were weak, their dim yellow light couldn’t reach that far, and as they hummed, they seemed to warn me: “Don’t go there. It’s dangerous.”

But I was determined. No matter what, I wanted to find the source of that sound, ignoring the voice of intuition screaming in my head.

The sound came from the wasteland. I heard the wind whispering through dry grass, turning suddenly sharp and cold. I couldn’t see a damn thing. There was a small flashlight built into my radio, so I went back to get it — then began my descent into the dark. (I remember joking to myself when I said that.)

Somewhere ahead, the sound grew louder — and soon I found it. It was a door. A simple door, like to an old shack, crudely made of planks, standing in a doorway that seemed to rise straight out of the ground. Behind it — nothing. Just the same empty field. It looked so surreal that at first I didn’t believe my eyes. But it was real.

I turned around to look at the parking lot — everything was still there. Nothing had changed.

A sharp creak broke the silence — the door swung open from a gust of freezing wind (it was summer) and slammed hard against the frame. But by then, it didn’t matter anymore.

In the doorway, darkness was swelling. Why “swelling”? I don’t know. The understanding came from nowhere. I stood there, mesmerized, shining my weakening flashlight (the batteries were dying),watching how that black, rippling darkness rose and fell like it was breathing…

I don’t remember how long I stood there. Maybe long enough to start seeing — and hearing — things later. The understanding came afterwards.

The last thing I remember is standing there — in front of that doorway.

The next thing I knew — I woke up in a hospital. They said it was a suicide attempt. I didn’t remember anything from that night, even though several days had passed. Blood tests showed only alcohol. They said some junkies found me — hanging in an abandoned construction site where they came to shoot up.

I burned with shame before my parents. They worried so much and couldn’t understand how I could do that — to myself, and to them. After that, I felt — mistakenly — as if a cold gap of alienation had opened between us.

Ten years later, they were gone. I grieved so hard I thought I’d break apart. I still cry sometimes. They were the only ones who ever truly cared about me.

After the funeral, I tried to find that same parking lot again — the place where it all began. But I couldn’t. Not on a map, not in reality. As if something was working hard to convince me that it had never existed at all. That I’d imagined everything. Sure. Imagined. Right.

Let me wipe my eyes and tell you what happened next.

The aftermath of that suicide came quietly — as soft, whispering shadows – flickering at the edge of my vision. They didn’t bother me, really. I’d even say they gave variety to my life — a mix of alcohol, narcotics, and antidepressants. They became my constant guests in that cluttered guest room of addiction, where there was no meaning, no joy left at all.

At some point I realized — I’d turned myself into a fucking radio receiver. Catching whispers, inhuman thoughts, and grotesque visions.

And then… then I started writing. Stories. Poems. Fragments of phrases that only I could hear — whispered to me from that side, from that door, wrapped in images from the dark field of existence. For a while, I showed them to no one.

At first, when I began sharing my writing online, I thought I was writing ordinary horror stories. But it turned out — readers broke down in tears, fell into horror, and couldn’t shake the unease for days after reading. It burrowed into them, like a splinter in the soul — always aching, never healing.

In my visions, white‑winged angels fuck filthy demons with divine lust, driven by a holy frenzy of desire. They birth shadows — and those shadows hurry toward me, bringing stories slick and trembling, still wet with newborn terror.

And then, recently, I got an email from a publisher I’d never heard of Gloomuar Publishing – a polite invitation to come in person for a meeting. If both sides agreed, we’d discuss the terms of cooperation.

Of course, on their terms. That’s what I thought right away. My inner skeptic wanted to tell them to fuck off, but curiosity won. I tied off a vein, shot a few points of dot, and wrapped myself in the warm blanket of the high as the bus carried me to the capital on the appointed day.

Their office was in the very center — a glass tower among a thousand identical ones. I stopped for a moment, exhaled, and went inside.

A sleek young man was waiting — well-dressed, well-groomed. He didn’t introduce himself. I didn’t care. I sat down without being invited — and, as it turned out, I was right: I accepted all their conditions.

The payment was impressive — as impressive as the strange and strict rules regarding my work. From that day on, every poem and story I write belongs to them. Even the ones written before.

One story or a hundred — doesn’t matter. I’m not allowed to publish anywhere else. I asked: “So where will my stories be published, then?” The man smiled politely: “That’s not your concern. You’re being paid well enough to never have to worry again.”

That’s when I signed the nondisclosure agreement.

But now — I don’t care anymore. Sooner or later, everything ends.

Now, when I look at the moon, I see only emptiness inside myself. When I hear the wind moan through the branches — it’s just the voice of my endless grief.",1,1768004457.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Their two album releases were great and I always wished they lived up to their potential when i listen to such tracks as Rabbiteen, Losing His Touch, and Clear Hearts Grey Flowers. 

Now, I am bringing them up because prior to Sexless Demons and Scars, Marilyn Manson was a producer on singles/demos for the band, which was released as Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992-1996. From the notes, Manson contributed to 17 tracks, and I do have some notes and questions.

A few of these tracks are my absolute favorite in the Jack Off Jill Disography, especially Media C-Section and Bruises Are Back in Style. Cherry Scented is fast and hard-hitting, while Kringle is playful. 

These tracks make me wonder ""What if the Spooky Kids sang/release these tracks?"" They are basically similar in structure and tone, guitar has the Daisy twang - I believe he worked on them since Manson produced the songs - and the beginning of songs have interesting snippets, an example would be Cyclopes and Bruises Are Back in Style. And yes, I do know Daisy joined Jack Off Jill for a cup of coffee after his departure from Marilyn Manson.

From the very first night, the connection felt unusually strong and natural.

We danced, talked for hours, exchanged Instagram, and she stayed close to me most of the night. She initiated conversation, played with her hair, oriented her body toward me, and we joked a lot. She even made playful comments in front of her friends like “I’ll give him American citizenship and he’ll give me Mexican citizenship.” It felt flirty but also warm and genuine.

Over the next couple of days, we made plans. We hung out with her friends, and again she mostly focused on me — sitting next to me, including me in conversations, even paying for my food. Later that night, we ended up at her place instead of going out again. She sat very close to me on the couch, accepted physical closeness, and at one point said things like “your hand is kind of far” so I’d hold her closer.

Eventually we kissed. I asked explicitly if it was okay, and she said yes. She did say she didn’t want things to go sexual that first night, which I respected. Still, we cuddled, held hands, and slept together (no sex). She hugged me tightly, seemed comfortable, and even joked that her dog was “jealous of us.”

The next morning and the following day, she continued texting me, asking about my plans and showing interest. She said she’d like me to stay over again sometime.

Then suddenly, when I tried to make plans again, she said she wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t meet. She didn’t propose an alternative day. I later sent a low-pressure message saying I’d really like to see her if she felt better, maybe for coffee or a movie — and she left me on read. She still follows me on Instagram but stopped engaging.

What’s confusing is that:

	•	She showed clear interest initially (verbal, physical, emotional)

	•	There was no conflict or awkward moment

	•	I respected her boundaries

	•	She knew I was leaving town soon, which she mentioned several times herself

I’m not angry — just genuinely trying to understand.

Is this a case of someone enjoying connection in the moment but pulling back when things feel real?

Or someone who likes intimacy but avoids follow-through?

Or did I simply read things more deeply than she did?

Mostly, I’m surprised by how strong the connection felt in such a short time, and how quickly it faded without explanation.

The scent of pine and damp earth was so sharp it stung, carried by a heavy wind that turned the lake's surface into a grey mirror. 



""I’m gonna take some of these posters to the board by the campsite,"" Tim called out over the rattle of the idling engine. He didn't look back, his eyes fixed on the stack of missing person flyers Katie handed him. ""You two head on up. Radio me when you need a lift."" 



""See you soon, Tim,"" Katie said softly, her voice nearly lost to the wind as she walked over to me. I gave Tim a sharp nod, which he reciprocated with a grunt before the truck lurched away. 



We stood at the base of the tower. It was a structure of weathered wood and steel, rising high above the canopy. A small shed sat nestled besides its legs, reeking with gasoline. I found the generator tucked inside—a squat, iron beast. With a sharp tug of the cord, it sputtered to life, a low hum beginning to vibrate through the ground. 



The wooden staircase groaned under our weight as we climbed, the wind howling through the gaps in the treads. Katie led the way, her pace quick but her shoulders tight. 



""It’s going to be less creepy now, knowing someone’s actually in this thing,"" she called back, her voice trembling slightly. ""I swear, sometimes I look over from my post at night and I can see someone standing up here... just looking back at me."" 

She looked over her shoulder, and for a second, the playfulness was gone. She was being dead serious.

""I think you’re just being crazy, Katie,"" I replied, though a cold spark of unease flickered in my chest. I kept my eyes on the horizon to distract myself. The view was staggering—the lake was a vast void of silver, and the mountains in the distance against a blurring sky. On the far shore, I could just make out the silhouette of another tower. ""Is that yours?""

""That’s the one,"" she whispered.

Suddenly, Katie gasped and recoiled, her boot skidding on the top landing. I lunged forward, grabbing the center rail as I saw the gap. A section of the outer banister had broke off.

""Jesus—I could have fallen,"" she breathed, her face pale.

""Well, it’s a good thing you didn't,"" I said, my heart hammering against my ribs. I looked down at the sheer drop to the forest floor. ""That’s a long way to go for a shortcut.""

""Sorry... I’ll make sure Tim fixes that tonight,"" she muttered, regaining her composure. I nodded, though I felt for the guy. Tim already does so much from what I’ve gathered.

Katie leaned against the door-frame, the color returning to her cheeks as she dangled a key in front of my face. I took it, the cold against my palm, and turned the lock. The door creaked open into a room shrouded in deep shadows. 



I stepped inside and found a pull-string near the frame. With a sharp tug, the shutters outside swung upward, and the room was instantly flooded with sunlight. 



To the left, a clean bed with a heater, a set of sturdy drawers, and a small kitchenette featuring a pristine oven and fridge. A wide desk sat at the front window, equipped with a lamp, a rugged-looking radio, and an older computer that from a glance I can tell will be a pain in my ass. 



In the center of the room stood a circular table with a complex brass sighting tool—a ""fire map."" It looked like a piece of naval equipment, designed to pinpoint smoke. A soft grey carpet covered the floor, muffling the sound of my boots. 

""So, what do you think?"" Katie asked, watching me with a grin that said she already knew the answer.

""Seriously? I love it,"" I admitted, running a hand over the smooth wood of the desk. ""I’ve lived in apartments that didn't look this good.""

She walked over and plopped down on the edge of the bed, swinging her legs. ""Despite walking a marathon every week, this place does have its perks. ”

Atop the desk I noticed the stack of staff manuals and topographical guides I’d need to memorize. A cork-board above the radio held a list of emergency frequencies and a direct line to the main office.

""I know it’s a lot to take in at once,"" Katie said, standing up. ""Take today to get your bearings. Tim will be back soon, and I’ll be right over there."" She pointed through the glass toward the distant tower on the opposite shore. ""I’ll radio you once I’m back at my post.""

She gave me a playful wink. I stood up and walked her to the door, feeling a genuine sense of gratitude. ""Thank you for everything, Katie. I’m not great at first impressions, so I’m glad I didn't blow it with you and Tim.""

I extended my hand for a formal shake, but she ignored it, pulling me into a quick, firm hug instead.

""See ya, Nathan. I’ll tell Tim about the banister. Just... be careful when you're out on that balcony, okay?""

""Bye, Katie.""

I watched through the windows as she descended, her form shrinking until she disappeared. Just as she hit the trail, I heard her faint voice drifting up one last time: ""Oh, and if you need the pisser, there's a toilet under the tower legs!""

I laughed, the sound echoing in the quiet room. I turned back to the view of Hollow Pines stretching out before me. For the first time in years, I felt like I could breathe.

The morning clarity had begun to fade into the bruised purple of a mountain twilight. I stood by the small kitchen, the scent of cheap coffee masking the smell of pine. I carried my mug to the desk, I fumbled with the power button until the monitor flickered to life, bathing the dim room in a harsh, electronic glow.

The operating system groaned through a loading screen before a window popped up: LOGGER v4.2.

""Logger is an amazing tool that helps rangers like yourself stay updated with what's going on in your sector!"" the text chirped in a font that felt twenty years out of date. It was a digital ledger, a way to prove I was actually doing something out here.



I clicked through the fields:

Hikers Assisted: 0

Medical Emergencies: 0

Campers in Sector: I stood up, squinting through the glass toward the designated clearing by the lake. The shadows were stretching long fingers across the grass, but the fire pits were cold and the grounds were empty.

I filled in the date—January 10th, 2016—and hit submit. I watched the progress bar crawl across the screen, a tiny green line representing my official existence in Hollow Pines. I leaned back, my swivel chair letting out a long, piercing squeal. Outside, the sun was just hanging over the peaks, waiting to disappear.

The door didn't just open; it hit the wall with a crack that sounded like a gunshot. My soul nearly left my body as I lunged out of the chair, coffee splashing all over my hand.

A man stood in the doorway. He was broad-shouldered, wearing a Stetson and a jacket that looked like it was made of reinforced scowl. This had to be Dan. He didn't say hello. He slammed the door shut behind him and took two steps into the tower.

“You lied on your CV,” he barked. The air in the room suddenly felt very thin. “You better start fucking talking, Nathan.”

I opened my mouth, but he didn't give me the chance.

“I rang up the place you said you worked for back east. Spent twenty minutes on hold just for them to tell me they have no record of a Nathan Galloway.” He was vibrating with a localized, intense fury. I could see the pulse thudding in his temple.

I felt the heat crawl up my neck—half embarrassment, half the defensive reflex.

“Yeah, I lied,” I said, my voice steadier than I felt. “I don’t have professional experience doing this. But you were desperate. You’ve got people vanishing and a park that looks like it’s falling apart. I needed a way out, and you needed a body in this chair.” I reached for the staff manuals on the desk. “I’m reading the books. I’m learning the—”

He snatched the manuals out of my hand and hurled them across the room. They hit the wall and slumped to the carpet. “The books are fucking tips, Nathan! They aren't step-by-step guides on how to survive when things go sideways!”

He stepped in close, jamming a thick finger into my chest. “You’re a liability. I don’t need this fucking shit right now—”

I’d had enough. I grabbed his wrist and shoved him back. Hard. He stumbled, his boots skidding on the new carpet until he hit the fire-map table. For a second, the only sound was the hum of the PC and the wind screaming outside. I thought he was going to swing. His fist clenched, 

Then, he exhaled—a long, ragged sound of defeat. He rubbed his face with his palms. “Is there anything on it that’s real?” he asked, his voice dropping to a low simmer.

“Yeah. My qualifications. And I did scouts, so—”

The look of pure, unadulterated anger he gave me cut the sentence short.

“Look,” I said, stepping forward. “I do one thing out of line, my ass is yours. But from the sound of things, you can't afford to lose another ranger. I’m here. I’m staying. Deal with it.”

Dan stared at me for a long beat, judging the weight of his options. He knew I was right, and he hated me for it. Without another word, he turned and marched toward the door.

He nearly walked straight off the edge of the landing, his boot catching on the splintered wood where the banister had snapped. He let out a snarl of frustration and snatched the radio off his belt before he’d even hit the first step down.

“Tim!” he roared into the handset, his voice echoing through the floorboards. “Get your ass up to Tower 7 and fix this fucking railing now!”

I stood at the window, watching him storm toward his truck. I felt a twinge of guilt for Tim—the guy was already overworked, and now he was catching the splash damage of my mess.

I looked back at the ""Logger"" screen. My report was still there. Nathan Galloway. Sector 7-8. Everything is fine.

I took a sip of what was left in my mug and looked out at the trees. The sun was gone. The dark was absolute. And I was officially an intruder in my own home.

I placed the coffee mug back on the desk, the steam swirling in the cooling air of the tower. As I bent down to retrieve the manuals Dan had hurled across the room, something caught my eye. there was a distinct, circular indentation—a outline in the wood. I set the books back on the desk and knelt, peeling back the heavy rug. 



flush with the sturdy floorboards, was a heavy wooden hatch. A tarnished brass ring was recessed into the center, secured by a padlock that looked significantly older and more industrial than the flimsy lock on the front door. Katie hadn't mentioned floor storage. Neither had Tim. I ran my thumb over the cold metal of the lock before folding the carpet back down,



A sudden, violent BANG against the door made me nearly jump out of my skin.

""Fuck!"" I barked, the word escaping out of pure habit

I yanked the door open to find Tim standing on the landing. He wasn't scowling like Dan. He had a wide, mischievous grin plastered across his face. He held up a sweating bottle of beer like a peace offering.

""Your first fuckin' day and you piss him off that much?"" Tim let out a raspy, barking laugh that echoed across the lake. ""I heard him screamin' over the radio halfway to the campsite. 'Galloway this, Galloway that.' You’re a legend already, kid.""

He didn't wait for an invite. He knelt down by the shattered banister and flipped open his toolbox, the clank of wrenches and hammers a grounding sound in the quiet evening. I took the beer, the glass cold and condensation-slicked against my palm. I popped the cap and took a long, much-needed sip.

""I see what you mean now,"" I said, leaning against the doorframe and watching him work. ""The guys mental.""

""Lyin about working as a ranger before probably didn’t help"" Tim grunted, already measuring a new piece of timber. ""But hey, you’re still standin', and you’ve still got the job.""

“I do feel horrible about lying. I just really needed this job and to—”

“Get away?” Tim finished the sentence for me, his tone shifting into something surprisingly understanding. He didn’t look up from his work, but the edge in his voice had softened. “I know the feeling, kid. More people come to these woods to disappear than to find themselves.”

He gave a final, hard whack to a fresh plank of wood and stood up, dusting his hands off on his jeans. “Banister’s fixed. Just don’t go leaning your full weight on it for a few hours while the wood settles.” He gave me a quick wink and a raspy laugh.

“Thanks, Tim. Truly. I’ll get you a beer—a real one—whenever I get paid.”

“Fridays,” he called back, already gathering his tools with the practiced speed of a man who’d done this a thousand times. “Night, Nathan.”

“Hey, wait—”

He paused at the top of the stairs, turning his head just enough to show he was listening.

“I found a hatch,” I said, gesturing back toward the center of the room. “Underneath the rug. It’s got a heavy padlock on it. You know what’s down there?”

Tim snorted, a cold breath escaping in the air. “Justin locking something? Doesn't surprise me. He’s the guy who lived here before you. Proper wackjob, that one. He left the park one night and never bothered giving us a call”

He shrugged, the metal tools clinking in his kit. “Just pry it off or something if you wanna use the space. It’s probably just filled with his old canned beans and paranoia.”

“Pry it with what?” I asked, looking around the relatively tool-free room.

“Fuckin’ anything. Sorry, I’ve really got to go.” He turned back toward the stairs, his boots thumping rhythmically against the wood. “My tower’s an hour’s drive and dan made me come here, im tired and im fixing up them dorms tomorrow” He disappeared around the corner of the landing, his voice fading into the whistling wind.

I sighed and retreated back into the warmth of the tower, the door clicking shut. I sat back down at the desk, my swivel chair offering its familiar squeal. Outside, the last orange glow of the sun was bleeding into the still, grey waters of Lake Ormond.

I took one last sip of the lukewarm beer, my eyes drifting from the beautiful horizon to the corner of the heavy rug. I pulled open the desk drawers, rummaging through paperclips, dried-out pens, and yellowing post-it notes. A pencil definitely wasn't going to win a fight against an industrial padlock. I looked at the rug, then at the floorboards, and shook my head. I wasn't about to start prying up my own floor.

I kicked off my boots, the thud of leather against the carpet muffled and heavy. I shed my jacket and moved to the windows, lowering the shutters. The room transformed instantly; the vast view of Hollow Pines was replaced by thin, sharp rays of evening sun stabbing through the gaps in the wood. The only other light came from the low, amber dim of my desk lamp, casting long, jittery shadows against the walls.

I switched on the heater, which emitted a dusty, metallic smell as it began to tick-tick-tick with warmth. Rummaging through the kitchen cupboards, I managed to scavenge a box of stale crackers and a half-full jar of strawberry jam.

""What a delicacy,"" I muttered to the empty room.

I was mid-spread, carefully layering the jam onto a cracker, when the radio on the desk hissed into life for the first time. The static was sharp, cutting through the silence of the tower like a blade.

""Nathan, do you read me? Over.""

The voice was old—gravelly and weathered, like it had been cured in tobacco and mountain air. I dropped the butter knife, the cracker snapping in half on the desk, and hurried over. I fumbled for the button on the base of the rugged microphone.

""Hello? Who is this?"" I asked, leaning in.

There was a beat of static, then a sigh that sounded like shifting sandpaper. ""This is Craig. And when you’re finished speaking, you say ‘over.’ Over.""

I rolled my eyes at the ceiling, though I felt a small spark of relief at hearing a human voice that wasn't Dan’s. ""Hi, Craig. Why are you radioing me? Over.""

I waited. I held my breath, watching the little green TX light on the radio face. Five seconds passed. Ten. The only sound was the low hum of the heater and the wind pressing against the shutters.

Nothing.

""Thanks, Craig,"" I whispered to the silence. I sat back down and reached for my broken cracker.

The radio continued to crackle more and more until I decided to turn it off, it must be having issues. I was waiting for katie to radio, I look out through the shutter and her tower’s barely visible through the spreading dark mist of night. Her lights are out so I think she might be calling it a night. I should do the same.



The radio didn’t stay silent for long. Instead of Craig’s voice, a steady, rhythmic crackle began to scream through the speakers, I frowned, twisting the squelch knob to dampen the noise, but it only seemed to get more erratic—a frantic, electronic hissing that set my teeth on edge.

""Channels must be fucked"" I thought, reaching out and clicking the power dial to Off. 

I moved to the window and adjusted the shutter just enough to peer out. I was still waiting for Katie to radio in like she promised, but the world outside had changed. The mountains had been swallowed by a thick, creeping mist that rolled off the lake like grey smoke. Her tower, usually a clear silhouette against the horizon, was now barely visible in the dark.

I squinted, looking for the warm amber glow of her lamps, but her windows remained black. No light, no radio call. Maybe her radios fucked too, or maybe she’d just called it a night without thinking to check in.

The adrenaline is finally evaporating. My bed, simple and narrow as it was, looked like just what I needed.

Tomorrow, I thought, pulling the blankets back. Tomorrow.",1,1768004369.0,u_Fun_Angle7216,0,1.0,False

CHAPTER ONE 
Arrival

I always imagined winter break would feel cinematic; soft snow, cozy sweaters, maybe a tasty mug of cocoa held with both hands like I was in a holiday commercial. And honestly? When I stepped out of the car in my faux‑fur coat and rhinestone earmuffs, the snow falling in perfect little flakes around me, it did feel cinematic.
If you ignored Rowan.
“Are you done posing?” he asked, slamming the trunk like it owed him money.
“I wasn’t posing,” I said, which was a lie. “I was appreciating the moment.”
He rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might pop out of his face. “Right.”
Classic Rowan. Always ready with a comment, always allergic to joy. But this trip was supposed to be different. A chance to reconnect, according to my mother, which meant she was tired of us “bickering” and wanted to outsource the problem to a cabin in the woods.
The cabin itself was cute in a rustic, “I hope the Wi‑Fi works” kind of way. Wooden beams, a porch dusted with snow, warm yellow light glowing through the windows. It looked like the kind of place influencers rented for aesthetic content, which I appreciated. If I was going to be emotionally tortured by my cousin for a week, at least the backdrop was nice.
Inside, the air smelled like pine and cinnamon. I immediately claimed the bigger bedroom.
“Obviously,” Rowan muttered.
“Obviously,” I echoed, tossing my bags onto the quilted bedspread. If he wanted the bigger room, he should’ve walked faster. Or been nicer. Or both.
For a few hours, things were almost… pleasant. We made cocoa. We played a board game. Rowan even laughed once, which felt like spotting a rare animal in the wild.
I let myself believe this trip might actually work.
Then the knocking started.
A soft, deliberate tap‑tap‑tap on the far wall.
I froze. “Did you hear that?”
Rowan didn’t look up from his phone. “Hear what?”
Tap‑tap‑tap.
“That.”
He shrugged. “Old cabin. Relax.”
Relax. Sure. Because nothing says “relax” like unexplained knocking in a remote forest.
But I let it go. I was determined to be normal. Calm. Unbothered. I wasn’t going to let a little noise ruin my perfect winter aesthetic.
Not yet.
The next morning, I woke to the smell of coffee and the sound of Rowan humming, which was suspicious on its own. He was standing at the stove, wearing the same hoodie he’d worn for three days straight, stirring a pot like he was auditioning for a cooking show he didn’t want to be on.
“Morning,” I said, rubbing my eyes.
“You look like a raccoon,” he said.
“Thank you,” I replied sweetly. “I try.”
We ate breakfast. A sloppy plate of eggs and corned beef hash, fresh from the can! We joked. We planned a hike later in the day. For a moment, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: hope. Maybe we could fix things. Maybe we weren’t doomed to be the family’s favorite feud forever.
I got ready for our hike after breakfast. Pink boots, pink backpack, pink bear mace. Fashionable AND practical. Because of the snow we didn’t go too far but just enough to see the beautiful view from the cliff. The sun glowing off of the crystalized lake below. The trees painted with sheets of white snow. A few snide comments from Rowan, but nothing as bad as the usual torment he put me through. 
Growing up, Rowan always treated me cruelly. Whenever I’d tell on him or whenever any of our parents even saw what he put me through, it’d always be the same response… “Boys will be boys”. I hated that statement. It was just a way to excuse them being horrible. Once we got older he learned how to do more harm psychologically and emotionally so it wouldn’t be as noticeable. The worst part was that he was good at it. He knew what to say to really get under my skin like a parasite. My mother forced me to go on this trip hoping we could make amends. I’m hoping so, but I don’t have much left. 
That night, the knocking returned.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
 Pause.
 Tap.
I sat up in bed. “Rowan?”
No answer.
I stepped into the hallway. The cabin was silent except for the wind outside.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
This time, it came from the living room wall.
“Hello?” I whispered.
The knocking stopped.
I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.
Over the next two days, the cabin grew stranger.
A mug I left on the counter appeared on the floor.
 A window I closed was suddenly open.
 My reflection in the bathroom mirror seemed… delayed, just for a heartbeat.
I told Rowan.
He laughed. “You’re being dramatic.”
The words hit me like a slap. He’d said them my whole life. Whenever I cried, whenever I stood up for myself, whenever I tried to explain how his teasing actually hurt.
“You always make things up,” he added. “It’s exhausting.”
I swallowed the sting. “I’m not making anything up.”
“Sure,” he said, already walking away.
I hated how easily he could make me doubt myself.
That night, I dreamed of someone standing at the foot of my bed. When I woke, my bedroom door was open.
I was sure I’d closed it.
On the fourth night, I woke to a whisper.
“Lila…”
My eyes snapped open. The room was dark, the air cold.
“Rowan?” I whispered.
No answer.
I stepped into the hallway. The whisper came again; soft, coaxing, almost familiar.
“Lila…”
It drifted from the living room.
I followed it, heart pounding.
“Who’s there?”
Silence.
Then a shadow moved behind me.
I screamed.
Rowan burst out of his room. “What is wrong with you?!”
“There was - I heard - someone was here!”
He stared at me with a mix of annoyance and something else. Something like fear.
“You need to calm down,” he said. “Seriously.”
But I couldn’t. Not anymore.
The next morning, Rowan confronted me.
“You were in my room last night,” he said. “Standing over me.”
“What? No, I wasn’t!”
“I woke up and you were just… staring.”
My stomach dropped. “I don’t remember that.”
“Sure,” he said coldly. 
I went back to my room to try and relax and settle my confused and scared mind.
The day spiraled.
I kept losing time.
 I’d blink and find myself in a different room.
 I’d hear whispers that stopped when I turned my head.
 I felt watched, even when I was alone.
By evening, the knocking had become pounding.
Rowan snapped. “I’m done. I’m leaving.”
“You can’t!” I cried. “The roads are iced over!”
“I don’t care. I’m not staying here with you like this.”
He shoved past me toward the door.
And then everything blurred.
A shout.
 A slip.
 A crash.
 Snow swirling in the open doorway.
 Silence.
When I came back to myself, Rowan was lying motionless outside, half‑buried in snow.
My breath fogged in the air.
“Oh,” I whispered. “Oh no.”
But even as I said it, something inside me felt… quiet. Peaceful.
Like the knocking had finally stopped.

CHAPTER TWO 
Aftermath

I didn’t cry right away.
People expect you to cry when something terrible happens, especially something “tragic,” which is the word everyone kept using, like they were all reading from the same script. But when I stood there in the snow, staring at Rowan’s still body, the cold biting through my coat, I didn’t feel anything.
Not shock.
 Not horror.
 Not grief.
Just… quiet.
Like someone had finally turned off a noise I didn’t realize had been blaring in the background.
But I knew how I was supposed to react, so I did. I screamed. I ran to him. I called for help with a trembling voice. I let the panic rise in my throat like a well‑rehearsed monologue.
And everyone believed me.
Why wouldn’t they? I’d always been good at performing.
The next few days blurred together; police questions, medical examiners, my mother’s frantic phone calls, Rowan’s mother’s sobbing. I floated through it all like I was underwater, watching the world move around me in slow motion.
I kept waiting for someone to look at me differently. To tilt their head and say, “Something’s off.”
 But no one did.
They all saw what they wanted to see: a grieving cousin who had witnessed a terrible accident.
I didn’t correct them.
The funeral was small and cold, the kind of cold that seeped into your bones and made you feel hollow. I wore a black coat with a cinched waist and a tasteful veil. Understated, elegant, appropriately somber. People whispered that I looked “so composed,” which was apparently a compliment.
Rowan’s mother hugged me so tightly I could barely breathe. “He loved you, you know,” she said into my shoulder.
I nodded, because that was what she needed. But the truth was more complicated. Rowan loved me the way a cat loves a laser pointer… fascinated, annoyed, and always ready to pounce.
When the service ended, I stood by the car while my mother talked to relatives. Snowflakes landed on my gloves, melting instantly.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I froze.
It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. It was just the memory of the cabin, the echo of a sound that had followed me for days. I told myself that. I repeated it like a mantra.
But the tapping didn’t stop until I got in the car and shut the door.
Back home, everything felt too loud. The heater hummed. The refrigerator clicked. The house settled with little pops and creaks. Normal sounds, everyday sounds, but they all felt amplified, like the volume had been turned up without my permission.
My mother hovered constantly, offering tea, blankets, emotional support, and unsolicited advice. “You need rest,” she said. “You’ve been through so much.”
I nodded and smiled and let her fuss over me, because it was easier than explaining that I didn’t feel tired. I didn’t feel anything.
Not really.
At night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep that never came. The house was quiet. My thoughts were not.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I sat up, heart pounding.
It wasn’t the walls.
 It wasn’t the floor.
 It wasn’t the wind.
It was inside my head. A memory, a rhythm, a pulse.
I pressed my palms to my temples. “Stop.”
The tapping stopped.
I lay back down, staring at the ceiling until morning.
A week after the funeral, my family insisted on a “healing dinner.” I didn’t want to go, but refusing would’ve caused more drama than attending, and I was too tired to deal with that.
The dining room was warm and bright, filled with the smell of roasted vegetables and the sound of forced cheer. My relatives talked in soft, sympathetic voices, like I was a fragile ornament that might shatter if someone spoke too loudly.
“How are you holding up, dear?” my aunt asked.
“You must be traumatized,” my uncle added.
My mother squeezed my hand. “She’s strong. She always has been.”
Rowan’s mother sat silently at the end of the table, eyes red, staring at her plate. I avoided looking at her for too long. Something about her grief felt too heavy, too real, too close.
I focused on my food instead, cutting my chicken into perfect little pieces.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
My fork hit the plate.
My mother looked up. “Sweetheart?”
I smiled. “Just thinking.”
After dinner, I slipped away to the bathroom and locked the door. I stared at my reflection in the mirror; flawless makeup, smooth hair, calm expression. I looked like someone who had everything under control.
But my eyes… My eyes looked tired. Not physically tired, but emotionally drained, like I’d been holding something heavy for too long.
I leaned closer to the mirror.
“Are you okay?” I whispered.
My reflection didn’t answer, obviously. But for a moment,  just a moment, it felt like she was studying me. Like she was waiting for me to admit something.
I turned away.
That night, I couldn’t sleep again. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the quiet hum of the house.
“You did what you had to,” a voice whispered.
I sat up, breath catching in my throat.
It wasn’t a ghost.
It wasn’t Rowan.
It wasn’t anything supernatural.
It was me.
A part of me I had never let speak before. A part that had been silenced by years of being told I was dramatic, too sensitive, too much.
A part that had finally snapped free in the snow.
“You don’t have to let them hurt you anymore,” the voice said.
I exhaled slowly. “I know.”
I wasn’t afraid of the voice.
I wasn’t fighting it.
I was listening.
And that was the part that scared me… or should have scared me.
But it didn’t.
Not at all.

CHAPTER THREE 
The House I Grew Up In

I didn’t plan on staying at my parents’ house for more than a few days, but somehow a few days turned into a week, and then two. My mother insisted it was “for the best,” which was her favorite phrase whenever she wanted me to do something I didn’t want to do.
“It’s just until you’re feeling more stable,” she said, smoothing my hair like I was a child. “You’ve been through so much.”
I didn’t argue. Arguing never worked in this house. It was like trying to shout into a snowstorm where the wind swallowed everything before it reached anyone’s ears.
Besides, I wasn’t sure what “stable” meant anymore.
My father barely acknowledged me when I came downstairs for breakfast the next morning. He sat at the head of the table, reading the news on his tablet, his coffee steaming beside him. He didn’t look up when I entered. He didn’t say good morning. He didn’t ask how I was doing.
He never did.
My mother fluttered around the kitchen like a nervous bird, placing a plate in front of me. “Eat something, sweetheart. You need your strength.”
My father turned a page on his tablet. “She needs routine,” he said, not looking at either of us. “Structure.”
My mother nodded quickly, as if he’d said something profound. “Yes, of course. Routine.”
I cut into my toast. “I’m fine.”
My father made a low noise, not quite a laugh, not quite a scoff. “You always say that.”
I didn’t respond. There was no point. He didn’t want an answer; he wanted the last word.
He always did.
Growing up, my father’s silence was the loudest thing in the house. He wasn’t cruel, exactly - just cold. Detached. Like he was observing us from behind glass. My mother tried to fill the space he left, but she was too soft, too apologetic, too afraid of upsetting him.
She apologized for everything.
If I cried, she apologized.
If I got upset, she apologized.
If I asked for attention, she apologized.
If my father ignored me, she apologized for him.
“Your father’s tired.”
 “Your father’s stressed.”
 “Your father doesn’t mean it.”
 “Your father loves you in his own way.”
I used to believe her. I used to think love could look like silence, like distance, like a closed door.
Now I wasn’t so sure.
That afternoon, my mother asked if I wanted to help her decorate the living room for the holidays. I didn’t, but saying no would’ve led to a whole conversation about “healing activities,” so I agreed.
We hung garlands. We arranged candles. We placed a wreath on the mantle. My mother hummed softly, the same tune she always hummed when she was trying to pretend everything was fine.
“You know,” she said, adjusting a ribbon, “your father has been very worried about you.”
I almost laughed. “Really.”
“Yes,” she insisted. “He just… he doesn’t know how to show it.”
“He never has.”
She flinched, just slightly. “He tries.”
“No,” I said, more sharply than I intended. “He doesn’t.”
My mother’s eyes darted toward the hallway, as if my father might appear and scold her for letting me say such a thing. “Lila, please. He’s doing his best.”
I stared at her. “Is he?”
She didn’t answer.
She didn’t have to.
That night, I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the glow‑in‑the‑dark stars still stuck to the ceiling. I’d put them up when I was ten, convinced they made my room look magical. Now they just looked sad; little plastic lies pretending to be something bright.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I sat up.
It wasn’t the house.
 It wasn’t the wind.
 It wasn’t the cabin.
It was a memory.
It was the sound of Rowan knocking on my bedroom door when we were kids, begging me to come play. It was the sound of him tapping his pencil during homework, driving me insane. It was the sound of him flicking my shoulder at family dinners, whispering jokes that made me laugh even when I didn’t want to.
It was the sound of him teasing me until I cried.
 It was the sound of him apologizing afterward, awkward and insincere.
 It was the sound of him growing sharper as we got older, learning exactly how to hurt me.
It was the sound of him falling in the snow.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I pressed my hands to my ears. “Stop.”
The tapping stopped.
But the quiet felt worse.
The next morning, my father finally acknowledged me. Sort of.
He stood in the doorway of the kitchen, arms crossed, watching me pour cereal. “Your mother says you’re not sleeping.”
I shrugged. “I’m fine.”
“You’re not,” he said, in that flat, matter‑of‑fact tone he used for everything. “You look exhausted.”
“Thanks.”
He ignored the sarcasm. “You need to get yourself under control.”
I froze. “Excuse me?”
“You’re letting this… situation consume you.”
“This situation?” I repeated. “You mean Rowan dying?”
He didn’t flinch. “Accidents happen.”
I stared at him, waiting for something; empathy, concern, anything. But his face was unreadable.
My mother rushed in, placing a hand on his arm. “She’s grieving,” she said quickly. “She needs time.”
“She needs discipline,” he said.
I set my bowl down. “I’m not a child.”
He looked at me then, really looked at me, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes. Not anger. Not disappointment.
Fear.
It was gone in an instant.
“Get some rest,” he said, turning away. “You’re not yourself.”
But what if I was?
What if this was the most myself I had ever been?
That night, I dreamed of the cabin again. The snow. The cold. The open door. Rowan’s voice calling my name — not accusing, not angry, just… sad.
When I woke, my pillow was damp.
I wasn’t sure if I’d been crying or sweating.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I didn’t tell it to stop this time.
I just listened.

CHAPTER FOUR 
Cracks 
I woke up the next morning to the sound of my parents arguing downstairs, quietly, of course. They never fought loudly. Loud fights meant acknowledging something was wrong, and my parents were allergic to that.
I lay in bed, listening to the muffled voices drifting up through the floorboards.
“She’s not herself,” my father said, his voice low and clipped.
“She’s grieving,” my mother whispered back. “She needs support.”
“She needs discipline.”
There it was again. That word. Discipline. Like I was a misbehaving dog.
My mother’s voice trembled. “Please don’t start.”
“I’m not starting anything,” he said. “I’m stating facts.”
I stared at the ceiling, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest. This was the soundtrack of my childhood…  my mother pleading, my father dismissing, both of them pretending everything was fine as long as no one raised their voice.
Tap‑tap‑tap.
I closed my eyes. “Not now.”
The tapping faded, but the tension didn’t.
When I came downstairs, my father was sitting at the table with his coffee, pretending to read the news. My mother stood at the stove, stirring oatmeal like it was the most important task in the world.
“Morning,” I said.
My mother turned, smiling too brightly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep?”
“No.”
My father didn’t look up. “You should try harder.”
I blinked. “Try harder to sleep?”
“Yes.”
I waited for him to elaborate. He didn’t.
My mother shot him a warning look. “She’s doing her best.”
He set his tablet down with a sigh. “Her best isn’t enough right now.”
I felt something inside me tighten, like a thread pulled too taut. “What exactly do you want me to do?”
“Get control of yourself,” he said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world.
My mother stepped between us. “Please, both of you—”
“No,” I said, surprising myself. “Let him talk.”
My father’s eyes narrowed. “You’re being dramatic.”
There it was. The word that had shaped my entire life. Dramatic. The ultimate dismissal. The ultimate silencer.
I laughed, a sharp, humorless sound. “Of course I am.”
My mother flinched. “Lila—”
“No,” I said again. “I’m tired of pretending.”
My father stood up slowly, like he was preparing for a confrontation he thought he could win. “You’re tired? Your cousin is dead.”
The room went silent.
My mother’s hand flew to her mouth. “Please don’t—”
But he wasn’t finished.
“And instead of processing that like an adult, you’re making everything about yourself.”
I stared at him, stunned. Not because he said it, but because he meant it. He genuinely believed I was the problem. That I always had been.
Something cold settled in my chest.
“I’m not making anything about myself,” I said quietly. “I’m trying to survive.”
He scoffed. “You’re always trying to survive something.”
My mother stepped forward, voice trembling. “Please stop. She’s hurting.”
“She’s unstable, a spoiled, narcissistic little bitch!” he yelled.
I felt the air shift. My mother’s eyes widened, as if he’d crossed a line even she couldn’t ignore.
“Don’t call her that,” she whispered.
“Why not?” he asked. “It’s true.”
I didn’t realize I was shaking until my mother reached for my hand. I pulled away.
“I’m going for a walk,” I said.
My father shrugged. “Fine.”
My mother whispered, “Take a coat.”
I didn’t.

In the 1950s, the kind of decade that mistook glamour for permanence, he had already learned how fragile power could be. He was a man whose name traveled faster than he did — stitched into labels, whispered in salons, printed beneath photographs of women who wore his clothes like armor. Wealth had made him untouchable, fame had made him unreal, and yet none of it could prevent the quiet, humiliating fact of a stalled engine on a forgotten road.

The car died without ceremony. No explosion, no drama—just a cough, a shudder, and silence. He tried once, then twice, then stepped out into a stretch of land that seemed to have misplaced itself on the map. Fields between forests and hills, a horizon that refused to offer answers. Somewhere in the distance, a town existed not because anyone had planned it, but because people had needed to stop moving.

He walked the rest of the way.

The town was small enough to feel accidental. A few buildings, a gas pump, a pub with a faded sign whose paint had given up years ago. Inside, time moved more slowly, as if it had nowhere urgent to be. The smell of fried food clung to the walls, and a radio hummed softly behind the bar. He stepped in not as a legend, but as a man who needed a phone and something warm to eat.

That was when she appeared.

She was not remarkable in the way magazines demanded. No careful polish, no cultivated mystery. Just young, tired in the way people get when they have never left where they were born, and beautiful in a way that felt almost unfair to the room she stood in. She wore a simple uniform, apron tied too tightly, hair pinned back with more effort than reward. When she spoke, it was with the practiced kindness of someone who had learned to be pleasant without being hopeful.

She took his order. She pointed him toward the phone. She noticed, without comment, that his suit did not belong in this place.

It was only later — between the coffee refills and the sound of his voice drifting through the receiver — that she understood who he was. Not because he announced it, but because men like him carried their gravity with them. When he asked about a mechanic, she gave him a name. When he asked how long it would take, she shrugged and said the truth: maybe today, maybe tomorrow. Things moved differently here.

He stayed.

They spoke in fragments at first. About the car. About the road. About how far the nearest city was. Then, gradually, about other things — things that did not belong to either of them but hovered anyway. He mentioned a runway delayed by an unexpected absence, a model who had vanished hours before she was meant to walk. He said it lightly, as if it were an inconvenience rather than a crack in a carefully controlled world. She listened, eyes sharp now, posture altered by interest she could not hide.

She asked what a runway was like. He told her.

Not in grand terms, but honestly — the lights, the music, the way a room could hold its breath. The way clothes could turn a person into someone unrecognizable, even to themselves. She laughed once, short and disbelieving, and said she had never owned anything beautiful that wasn’t meant for Sunday.

He looked at her then. Really looked.

The thought came to him fully formed and dangerous in its simplicity: she could do it. Not just wear the clothes, but inhabit them. She had a way of standing that suggested escape, a restlessness that no amount of small-town politeness could disguise. When he said as much, she went very still.

She did not ask if he was serious. She asked what would happen if she said yes.

He told her the truth, or at least the version of it he believed in: trains, cities, rooms full of strangers who would learn her face. Work that was not easy but was transformative. A chance that came once, if it came at all.

She told him she would go.

Not because of the clothes — though the thought of silk and cashmere made her smile — but because she had always known she would leave. This was simply the shape her leaving took. She said it plainly, as if stating a fact that had been waiting for the right witness.

There were only two conditions.

He could not let anyone from that town know where she went.
He could not bring her back.

The words were calm, but they carried the weight of something buried. Whatever waited for her beyond the pub’s door was not nostalgia. It was obligation, expectation, a life already decided. She wanted distance, not just miles but erasure.

He agreed.

The mechanic arrived near dusk. The car was fixed with unremarkable efficiency, hands blackened with grease, the problem resolved as quietly as it had appeared. Before she left with him, she asked for a little time. He waited at the edge of town while she walked the familiar road back to the farm where she had been raised.

The fields were loud with work when she arrived—her father and brother bent to their labor, backs turned, attention fixed on the earth that had claimed them long ago. No one saw her slip into the house. Inside, she moved quickly and without sentiment, gathering only what could be carried: a change of clothes, a small bundle of personal things, nothing that would slow her down or invite questions later. She did not write a note. There was no point in explaining an absence that had been inevitable for years.

When she left the farmhouse, she did so unseen, the door closing softly behind her. By the time the sun dipped low enough to stain the windows amber, she was back on the road. She climbed into the passenger seat of his car with her small bag at her feet and the certainty, now sharpened and irreversible, that she would never belong to that land again.

From the outside, it might have looked reckless. A powerful older man indulging a whim. A young woman mistaking opportunity for salvation. History would later reduce it to a footnote—a discovery, a muse, a lucky break. But from a distance wide enough to see the truth, it was something quieter and more exact.

It was a man whose world had been meticulously constructed, interrupted by chance. It was a woman who had been waiting for an interruption her entire life.

And somewhere between a broken-down car and a fading town, they both stepped off the path they were meant to follow—never looking back, and never saying each other’s names aloud, as if naming the moment might undo it.

Hey there! Just a heads up, I won’t be replying to simple messages like “Hi” or “Hello.” When you reach out, let me know what you’re into, or if you have any ideas in mind!

I prefer F4M for this plot, where I’d play the female. You don’t have to be male yourself, just play the older gentleman! A quick note: My characters are usually petite and short. If that’s not your thing, we might not be a good match.

THIS WILL BE SET IN THE 1950s!!!

I love story-driven roleplays, especially slow-burn romances where characters grow and connect naturally. A 60/40 mix is my ideal, but I could also go for a 50/50 balance.

I’d prefer someone literate. I usually write quite a lot and in a very detailed manner, so don’t bother me for one-liners! Adv-Lit to Novella is preferred! Also, 3rd person only, please. I have more than 10 years of experience in roleplay, so I know what I’m looking for in a roleplay partner!

Additionally, I would really like it if you played a reference I will be providing! Just as your character’s face/body claim! If not, do keep in mind that I’m very picky about my partner’s character’s appearance!

And please note: I only want to be contacted by adults (18 years and older). If you’ve read all this, include the word ‘Bubble’ in your message! (｀_´)ゞ (I won’t be responding to messages without it!) ",1,1768004325.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

I’m dreaming for what feels like the first time in forever.  I woke up this morning at 0400, wide awake, even though I’ve been getting much better sleep over the past week.  I knew I was having a dream and couldn’t put my finger on it; I just knew I did NOT want to go back to sleep and fall back into it.  It wasn’t until I was fully awake that I realized I was dreaming about throwing back shot after shot of whiskey.  I might be reading too much into it but I think my “nope not going back to sleep” reaction was my mind saying “absolutely not. We don’t do that anymore”.  Instead of going back to bed, I extended my morning coffee quiet time, did some chores, and spent an hour or so reading through posts on here then went about my day without even looking at hubby’s bottle of whiskey and thinking “weeeeelllll maybe”.  Then later at work, we had a celebration for the owners: every person over 21 today got a complimentary glass of bubbles to celebrate with them.  I finished my shift, cheers-ed regulars, coworkers, and friends with my Guinness 0, and came home to walk the dog.  For today, on both counts, I consider this Friday a win.  Looking forward to Day 17.

Straight off the bat, there were two items in my RFY, both of which were pretty cool. I didn't strictly need either of them, so I didn't order, but when I went back to the page one of them was gone. The other one held out until about 8 am, but then it disappeared too. Meanwhile, three other things dropped: one nice one, one ""meh"", and one which is destined to move on to AI and sit there for months while people complain about there being nothing to choose from but random parts. The third nice item was gone by 10 am. The ""meh"" item and the random part are still there.

I've seen RFY items disappear more often lately, which tells me that Amazon is offering them to more people than they have inventory. And if I'd waited till midmorning to check my RFY, all I would see was a tray for Keurig coffee pods and an adapter for electrical conduits, and I would say, ""I never get anything good in my RFY"" - which wouldn't have been true, it's just that I wasn't there to see and claim the good items that dropped. And since I believe unclaimed RFY items make their way to AI, that could be one of the reasons for the relative drought in that area; of the items coming from RFY, only the stuff nobody wanted is left.

The same logic could be true for AI. I've gotten some decent stuff there lately, but only when I'm awake during the drop. Once the drop is over, what's left gets picked over pretty efficiently by those who are around to see it, then people check Vine later in the morning and say ""There's never anything on here but car parts."" With sellers souring on the program and more Viners being added, the good stuff doesn't stick around for long regardless of which area it gets dropped into.",8,1768004059.0,AmazonVine,2,1.0,False
1q8ozpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q8ozpy/mf_the_fatigue/,[MF] The Fatigue,"I strain to remember my first experience of this fatigue. There was one day, while axing away roots as I prepared for my oxen to pull up stumps from my fields, that an odd feeling took hold of me. Gruelling work to be sure - it was not the first time I had become lightheaded and seen stars while labouring in the heat of the summer sun, but I had to pause as my legs became numb and weary. Under an oak tree I went to take rest, hoping the episode would pass with time; but as I sat under the tree I became perceptive of my eyes blinking, the sound of blood pulsing in my head, and the world slowed down. My surroundings began to look odd; the fields I had known for my whole life - my crops, my animals, the rolling hills, the trees, my homestead, the soaring birds, all looked foreign, brand new. This feeling was not refreshing, rather, it felt like a dream, in which my self was asleep, and now, I was a new person in this world. With an extended time under the oak tree I could not shake this feeling, so I turned my oxen in and took an early end to the day, hoping I could shake this feeling with some fine nourishment and a good sleep. 



From nearby villages we had in recent times been passed stories of relentless fatigue, neverending drowsiness, not to be confused with seasonal lethargy as in winter or in times of drought, but something more persistent. It was not the plague, we were told. Apart from tiredness, it had no other effects; and this we could not understand - until it was upon us. Like slow moving clouds against a sunny sky we were transitioned into darkness.



I remember a day before my odd day under the tree. Our neighbour Peter had gone away on business for some time and returned in a peculiar state. On returning to town, Peter’s carriage had come to a stop in the middle of the road and had sat still there for some time; so a local fellow, fearing Peter to be dead, approached his carriage, finding him to be asleep, and with some lasting trouble managed to wake him up. When Peter was finally awoken, it was told he did not know where he was, he did not recognize his home lands. He was helped from his carriage and brought to the nearest home - my home. Strange behaviour I cannot forget, on entering my home, Peter believed it to be his home, believed my family to be his family, my wife his wife. Tired lines on his face suggested his fatigue - a long journey he had overcome, so we laid him down for a rest. Following some hours of rest and showing no signs of waking, we forced him awake and gave him some sweet coffee, and asked him about his trip, if he had perhaps come down with something. Contrary to our suspicions he reported that nothing was out of the ordinary on his trip, the most usual for him in fact, many new medicines and methods for his apothecary were acquired, and now he just wanted to go to his kitchen for some food. His family soon came to retrieve him, to take him to his true home. 



Peter ceased to be seen at work in his apothecary, or about in town. Many days the sun passed over Peter’s closed eyes, despite his yearning for his shop and his work, his desire to help the ill of our town, no amount of sleep and no amount of coffee could rouse him. More time was spent by Peter in his bed than elsewhere, and it was from his bed that his life became lived - his family trying to get him out daily for sunshine and a dip in the river. Despite being a doctor and having all of the medicines at his disposal, Peter and his family could not cure his odd condition, and his beloved apothecary was forced to close up. 



It was not long after Peter’s return that I sat tired under the oak tree. More days passed with me becoming further engulfed in tiredness. My family became worrisome as I began sleeping later into the mornings, lusting for my bed earlier in the evenings. Three meals a day for me became two, and two meals became one. My family did not know what to make of it, bless their souls, and hoped it would pass, but these hopes turned into fear as the fatigue spread through our family and elsewhere, and our farm began slowly to fall into disrepair.



One by one the families of our town were taken down by this mysterious condition. All of the townspeople tried to take some time away from work, prayed relentlessly and at the church held community gatherings, and organized wholesome community activities. Personally, I tried to liven my mind with knowledge from new books, jogging in the hills every day, refreshing myself in the frigid river, and of course, coffee. Prior to this troubling time, nothing used to invigorate the mind and senses like sweet coffee; it’s dark, toasty, healing flavour bringing comfort at all times of year, its lovely smell wafting through the home in the morning - it could bring to life what the mind could not. Under the spell of this fatigue I drank more cups of coffee than ever before, mixed with sugar or honey, or both, but no amount of the once magical elixir could bring the livening effect. It only spiralled me deeper, as more and more amounts of coffee and sweetness became needed to bring me level and have me leave my bed. The vitality was gone, and after even five years it never returned. From lands afar we were informed that other populations were facing much the same struggle, but that some places still remained unaffected, and retained the life we used to know.



So of what we needed my family packed into bags and with what energy remained we set off in search of one of these places that still brimmed with life. With all of our might we tended our horses and beared the elements out from under the roof of our home. We contracted horrible illnesses from the far away towns we came upon, and I’m sad to say that I lost my youngest son to one of these plagues. Nearly every day we came upon a new town, and every time we came to find them ghostly, as entirely inactive as our home town. But one lucky day we came upon a town that spoke of a place like we sought, a refuge for liveliness, but were told unfortunately that it would not welcome us. We were distraught of course, saddened by the news, while the ones who shared it seemed to be entirely accustomed. After a few days of searching for this legendary place, we laid our weary eyes upon it; we found it surrounded by great stone walls topped with archers and watchmen, with a deeply dug trench all around. This is all we could and ever came to know about the place, as anyone who ventured too close would come under attack. So desperate I was that I once tried to near the wall, bringing gifts, raising my arms in surrender, talking calmly, slowly, wanting only to talk with one of the men on the wall, when I took an arrow to the upper arm. I have not returned to that place since.



My family and I now stay in a town neighbouring the walled sanctuary, with a kind family; we did not have the resources to return all the way home, and we found some hosts that concurred they could use any help our hands would be able to give under their roof. Our meals now consist solely of vegetarian ingredients, our drinks strictly water or tea, and we try our best to avoid sugar. I am having my daughter transcribe this for me as I lie in bed - her hands and mind have more life than mine. Every day we fight, and try to do some form of physical activity, and breathe some fresh air, hoping that someday the walled town will open its doors, or that the condition may be miraculously lifted, while we try to enjoy what life we have left.

Let's ditch the overwhelm and focus on what *actually* moves the needle. We're talking about those little shifts that ripple outwards, creating massive impact in our growth and daily happiness.

Here are a few thoughts that have been resonating with me lately:

*   **Morning Mimicry:** Instead of jumping straight into the chaos, dedicate the first 30 minutes to *you*. This could be journaling, a quick meditation, a walk in nature, or even just enjoying a quiet cup of coffee without scrolling. It sets a positive tone that can carry you through the entire day.

*   **The ""Why"" Anchor:** When you feel yourself drifting or hitting a roadblock, reconnect with your deepest ""why."" What's the bigger picture? What truly drives you? Keeping this front and center acts as your internal compass, guiding you back to your path.

*   **Mindful Micro-Breaks:** We all get stuck in the grind. Schedule intentional, *short* breaks. Stand up, stretch, look out a window, listen to a song. These aren't distractions; they're opportunities to reset your focus and prevent burnout.

*   **Embrace the ""Good Enough"":** Perfectionism is a growth killer. For many of us, aiming for ""done"" rather than ""perfect"" is a huge step forward. This frees up mental energy and allows for continuous iteration and improvement.

*   **Cultivate Curiosity:** Approach challenges with a curious mindset instead of a fearful one. Ask ""What can I learn from this?"" or ""How can I adapt?"" This simple reframing unlocks problem-solving superpowers.

Sometimes, navigating these internal shifts can feel heavy. If you're finding yourself struggling with emotional well-being, remember you're not alone and support is available. You can explore [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme).

1q8oygi,https://i.redd.it/wzl7xdvhzecg1.jpeg,Sugar-free Coffee Chocolate Chip Ice Cream,"This recipe is for a custard base ice cream that I churned in a regular ice cream machine. I substituted allulose and monk fruit for the sugar in the original recipe. It did not change the texture too much, although it is a little bit icier than using just sugar would be. It’s still leagues better than the store bought stuff! 

Be warned that this recipe as written here has a very strong coffee flavor that includes a little bit of the bitterness of the coffee to balance the sweetness. It is much more potent in flavor than store bought coffee ice creams, which I think is a point in its favor! If you don’t like strong coffee, you can definitely reduce the amount of grounds used. The original recipe used 5 tablespoons.


Ingredients:  
* 6 large egg yolks  
* 140g allulose and 5g monk fruit  
* 7T medium ground coffee  
* 1.5c heavy cream  
* 1.5c whole milk  
* 1/2t kosher salt to taste  

Directions:  
1. Mix egg yolks, sweetener, and coffee together.  
2. Add milk and cream.   
3. Cook on medium low, whisking constantly. Stop cooking when custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon or the mixture reaches 170°F.
4. Strain with a fine mesh strainer.   
5. Refrigerate until cold. Spin.  

Notes: 
- I added closer to 7T of coffee set on the largest grind. The original recipe only calls for 5T.  
- I also added bittersweet chocolate and a bit of coconut oil mixed together and melted in the microwave. I used this chocolate mixture to stream into the machine when the ice cream was almost done. You can use sugar-free chocolate for this.

I did one very lucky day Skullcavern run and got a Dark Cowboy Hat and a Blue one. I was wearing the Raccoon Hat at that poiint. Then I started wearing the Dark Cowboy one. I did the whole Skullcavern run with Triple Shot Coffee + Spicy Eel (+1 luck) and I think I had the luck buff from the statue.

Summer Tue 14 I had a very lucky day + statue luck buff and I did the whole run up until around floor 140 on Lucky Lunches + Ginger Drink. I got 2 Dark Cowboy hats out of the run, all from chests. I got ONE, only one single Prismatic Shard out of this run. I was blowing everything up with bombs.

The day after, Summer Tue 15, was ALSO a very lucky day, but this time I got the stairs buff. Did the whole run on Lucky Lunches + Ginger Drink. I got 1 Dark Cowboy Hat and 1 Red Cowboy hat, I went beyond floor 150. This was a slightly better run in terms of prismatic shards, I got 5. A lot of bombs used too.

That's 2 cowboy hats per Very Lucky day Skullcavern runs, all from chests, including floor 100 chest (red cowboy hat I got from it). I think ALMOST half of the chests I opened in the last 3 skullcavern runs I did had a cowboy hat of some sort.

Playing on switch 2.

Unrelated but on my 1st year I got these 4 Trash Can hats and the trash catalogue at random - only later I found out they were a bit rare.

I think I'm just venting. I couldn't believe I had a 2nd very lucky day in a row and then I got 2 Cowboy hats again. I thought I was being paranoid..

  
TLDR; Several **very lucky Skull Cavern runs** (with luck buffs) - keep getting an **absurd number of Cowboy Hats from treasure chests**—**2 per run**, sometimes from major chests like floor 100—as a bonus getting **fewer Prismatic Shards than expected**.

I just rented a small studio and I’m trying to figure out the best furniture layout. I attached the floor plan (bathroom excluded).

The entrance is on the right side, the kitchen element is already fixed where shown on the plan. The entire left wall is windows, but they’re not floor-to-ceiling.

What I definitely need is a sofa that converts into a bed, a desk with an office chair, and a wardrobe or cabinet for clothes. I will probably also get a coffee table and a freestanding shelf. I like lamps and plants, so I will get those somewhere for sure. I'm open to buying other things as well.

I’m renting, so I guess I can’t drill or mount things on the walls.

I probably won’t have a TV. I might get a projector later, but I don’t want the whole layout to be designed around that.

I’m looking for layout ideas and placement suggestions that would work with this floor plan. Any general advice is also welcome!

1q8ou2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1q8ou2h/my_experience_as_a_vtuber/,My Experience as a VTuber,"“Real” doesn’t mean a lot these days, I know, but right now I need to hold onto whatever I can, whether it’s real or not.

People should learn that my career path isn’t sunshine and rainbows made of money. I wouldn’t wish the stress of this job on my worst enemy, but it won’t be long before I’m not even able to say that much.

In just a few days every aspect of my life is going to be under scrutiny from a corporation. Every part of my day is going to be carefully monitored, recorded, then projected around the world. My beautifully animated avatar that the company spent around $10,000 to make will speak with a voice that sounds nothing like my own. My private life and my public life will be interchangeable forever. I’m not saying that to get pity or sympathy, but rather just to emphasize how dangerous this job can be if you’re even lucky enough to make money from it. Even as I write this and the clonazepam kicks in, I’m not sure of how much I want to tell of my own experience outside of the reason you’re seeing this post on this specific site. From my perspective it’s the most horrifying moment of my life, but on the internet it’s barely even a bad day.


More than anything, I guess, I’ll just be honest with you. That's all I have. Just in case anyone out there can spread this and learn from my own experience.

The sad truth is that stalkers and creeps are just another occupational hazard of even being under any kind of social spotlight. That being said, I’ve put out so little on my main channel about my personal life that I don’t mind giving just a little run down on my life as a VTuber.

It started a week after I began attending the community college I’d quickly drop out of. Along with deleting every email I’ve ever had, the company I’m signing on with has done a very good job of erasing my presence from the internet. Even if there had been a way to track me down? There isn’t one now.

The first question I’m going to be asked, a question I’ve always asked myself, is if I did it for the money.

The answer, the honest one, is yes. Back in the late 10’s VTubers were starting to go viral on YouTube. In no time, clips stolen from their channels were circulating with millions of views. I liked the idea of being a faceless personality. I’d spent most of my life watching and writing about the stuff you used to get stuffed in a locker for liking. Plus my voice was cute enough, why not try and use it?

When I told my roommates (Camilla and Aspen) my idea, very nervous and sure they were going to shut me down, they didn’t care at all. In fact they said they’d support me no matter what and that it was a good idea to hop on the gravy train before it took off.

That night we sat in our living room and talked. The kitchen light was dim and cast shadows onto the blankets we’d draped up against the windows. The air was clogged with the haze of incense smoke and vapor from the dab pen we passed around. After I’d told them my battle plan, they liked the idea so much that they wanted to try it with me. They weren’t as into anime or games as I was, but they were theater majors with dreams of making it big. It didn't matter if the stage was virtual, any stage was good enough.

We got our practice by making YouTube channels with shitty little avatars of our real selves playing games with each other. We didn’t get more than a hundred views per video. It was still the most fun I’ve had in this “career.”

Neither of my roommates have reached out in the years since I was signed on to a company. Maybe their messages were drowned out by the hundreds that are shoved in my inbox every day. My biggest fear for a while was that they were behind what’s happened to me. Camilla was never that toxic, but Aspen?

Yeah, I can see her being jealous enough to make me jump at shadows. Let alone ruin my life.

Out of the three of us, Aspen was the one that wanted to break out the most, and through any means necessary. And on the internet, especially to a barely-legal teen (as she advertised herself,) there was definitely a way to get popular fast. Before long she even had a facebook page for her strip show. Y’know, the ones you used to see in all the porn ads back in the day.

I’ve always felt glad that I didn’t go the route she did. Every week me and Camilla could hear her gagging on dildos and playing up orgasms to a crowd that threw money at her. Both her and her audience ignored the way Aspen’s avatar looked ever-so-slightly disgusted at what she was forcing herself to do whenever she forgot to put a specific face on.

A few of her donors said they were going to find where she lived and “take her on an amazing date,” or some variation of that. Aspen bought a gun soon after, the rules of our lease be damned. That was the first time I felt like we could be watched. Not that someone was, but at the time it almost would’ve been better to rip that band aid off and just confirm it was happening.

No, feeling like you’re being watched in your daily life is so much worse. Every time I went to class or went shopping at any store, the image of some creep changing the pitch of my model’s voice changer to find my voice, then find me, had me looking over my shoulder constantly. Every glance from someone on the street was a potential creep. But I put up with it, because the money was good.

Even mild success on the internet can change your life. It’s the gamble dozens of people make every day when they create a new social media or YouTube channel. Me and my roommates' bets paid off. We moved out of the dorms and into a pretty nice city apartment. The rooms were even spread out enough so that I didn’t have to hear Aspen’s constant gagging or Camilla’s nervous breakdowns.

She wasn’t having them for no reason either. Despite being the least popular of us with only a few hundred constant viewers, she was the first to have fan mail. Only it was sent to an apartment nobody should even know exists.

Love you lots, keep doing your best!

The letter was covered in hearts, smiley faces, and drawings of Camilla’s avatar. All of this would have been okay if our address, not our PO box, was printed on top left of the envelope.

We moved. As fast as we could, as quietly as we could, we found an even better apartment that me and Aspen mostly paid for out of pity for Camilla.

A week later an envelope was taped to the front door.

Sorry! I’ll leave you alone, I won’t bother you, keep doing your best! I’m not a stalker, I swear, just your biggest fan. Love you lots!

Camilla went to the post office and, through a year’s worth of legal trouble and moving heaven and Earth to see justice done, found and got a restraining order on the not-stalker. A week later he hanged himself in his closet, but by then Camilla was jaded and on enough medications to handle the situation as well as she could: doing monetized streams and videos warning other VTubers and their communities of what not to do. She made a lot of money. Even more after she made her face public and started dedicated social media to her “real” self.

Me and Aspen had long moved out by that point. She’s been doing pretty good. She does regular streams where her fancy 3D model quivers and thrusts against something-or-other with horrible tracking and no expression. She makes thousands of dollars every week. Forget a button that shoots dopamine in your system, why not a button that makes a girl moan for the low price of ten dollars?

Then came an agent. Then a manager, then public events and collaborations and a circus that has me as the centerpiece. Or, rather, my human corpse stapled to my avatar. And all of the other girls in these collabs dance, sing, and play into the jokes of their respective chats. Behind all of the hefty breasts and exposed midriffs, though, are girls in empty apartments with cumbersome tracking equipment weighing them down.

Our avatars wore revealing exercise clothes the last time this happened. We all made sure the cameras were pointed at the right angles and, as always, told our audience that we loved them with a virtual wink before we all signed off and were left standing, alone, in our empty apartments. Or maybe in their case, massive, expensive houses.

I’d assumed the letter I got a week or two ago came from her. Maybe even Camilla. They both resented me for being the first to sign on to the first English-speaking big-shot corporation emerging out of the VTube space. Funny thing about those companies, despite the tens of thousands of donations you get on stream, they almost never implement a donation limit. I didn’t have one, and never will, but it was always something you’d see some incel post about on Reddit. I’d actually just got done doing an anonymous dive into my own subreddit when I thought I heard someone knock on my apartment door.

There was a pink envelope taped to my door, long after I’d quit using a PO box and long after I’d stopped giving any sort of clue who I could be.

So proud of you! Been there since the beginning, love you!

It was typed, not handwritten like Camilla’s letter had been. There weren’t any smiley faces or drawings of my avatar either.

I’ve only left my apartment once since getting that letter, after I’d run out of anything to eat. My apartment was my universe. I log into my desktop, edit videos for five hours, eat whatever food I ordered, and continue to edit or do my show for five hours, then sleep.

Walks to the gas station used to be part of that routine. So did daily showers and phone calls with my mom.

Anything outside of that is just screens and sleep. The few times I could hear my slippers slapping against concrete and hear the noise of the city were a treasure. I miss them. The last one I took was what really made me want to write and post this.

I hadn’t showered, shaved, or flossed in a week. But I wanted, needed, to get out of my apartment. Ignore your human instinct all you want, but eventually your impulses win. By then I was eating a few gummies any time I drew the shades open, so I got pretty fucked up before my last trip to the gas station.

“Have a good day! Love you!”

It’s a fact that the cashier didn’t say this to me on the way out. I heard it anyway. As clear as the sound of my fingers hammering into this keyboard, I heard someone at the back of the store say those words. Maybe someone else did. At the time it was a lot easier to say I was having an episode and to get home as fast as I could.

So I ran back, the whole thing a mess of kaleidoscope eyes and idiot brain that I don’t remember at all.

The dull thunk of my doorknob refusing to turn snapped me back into focus.

Oh shit.

Oh SHIT!

My e-card came out of my wallet, which I just pressed to the door and usually worked fine, and I swiped it across the reader again. The light above the knob flashed red. I swiped it again.

And again.

And again.

I was crying when I finally let go of the doorknob. Drinks and food spilled out of the bags and we collapsed to the floor together. My sleeves were covered in snot and tears. Nobody had come out of their apartments to see what the commotion was.

All I could think to do was find someplace to sit and… I don’t know. Just sit. Nobody was in the complex’s lobby so I picked the closest faux-leather chair and sat. A few more tears came out but mostly I sat still, watching the cheap books on the cheap coffee table swirl in front of the unlit fireplace. But, for just a second, I was able to relax and look at the world as if it were a blurry painting that occasionally shifted colors. I could just sit still and wait for something to wake me up.

The elevator, stairwell, and front doors to the lobby were really loud. But I didn’t hear her open any of them. I blinked.

There she was, sitting next to me.

She looked exactly like my avatar had in the early days.

Black hair, olive skin just a few shades darker than mine, and a white dress. More distinguishing features came later to make more of an attempt to stand out.

For a second she was really there. Then I felt something held against my ear, and she was speaking with my manager’s voice.

“I’ll be over in an hour. I’m so excited for you XXXXX.”

A hisssssss came from behind me. One of the complex’s staff was making a cup of coffee and more than a little had dropped and sizzled on the heating pad. I hadn’t noticed her come in either.

“I feel like I’m freaking out,” I said with a flat voice. The world in front of me was still swirling and I could hardly focus. “I swear there’s a stalker. You saw how similar the letter was to Camilla’s.”

A homeless man came into the lobby and warmed himself by the fireplace. The sight was a dark, grey, oceanic wave in my vision that seemed all at once scary and calming. No doubt my oversized t-shirt with a faded mouse and matching pajama bottoms made me look homeless myself.

“We’re already taking care of that with your apartment’s staff, I’ve reminded you a dozen times now. They’re just trying to identify him with the other buildings in your area. We’ll have a warrant for his arrest in no time.”

“But I feel so… watched.”

“You’re going to get that feeling every now and then, there’s no helping it. You’re a public figure, even if only a handful of your fans can even guess your identity.”

With some effort I made myself sound like I was reluctantly agreeing with her.

“Just take a deep breath,” she said through my avatar. Her voice sounded like mine now. “Take your medicine. It’ll be okay. We’ll talk about it when I get there. Love you lots.”

She was gone. The lobby was empty.

Nobody had touched my little pile of groceries by the time I made it back to my apartment. A bottle of diet soda helped wash down more of my panic attack medication.

“Excuse me?” Someone said from behind me.

The soda and medication going down hit a wall of air from my lungs trying to come out as a scream. When I turned around, I would swear that the guy was the same one that worked at the gas station I went to for quick food.

“I’m so sorry!” He said, backing away and putting his hands up to prove he wasn’t a threat. The hallway behind him was a mirage of brown and beige that undulated, forcing me to hold onto my doorknob to keep my balance. Vomit curled up into my already clogged throat.

With a reflex I’d developed for doing my online show, I smiled. It was the perfect mask for my avatar if I happened to feel any genuine sadness or anger. For everything pre-planned, I had many emotions programmed to certain buttons on my software.

“I’m so sorry,” the guy said again. He was almost shaking. “I live down the hallway. I just wanted to let you know that someone’s been watching you the last few times you were at my work, the, uh, gas station down the street. I thought you’d… Want to know?”

The asshole didn’t even give me the dignity of saying anything back. Just scampered off down the hall into one of the apartments.

“Thanks, I appreciate it,” I said to nothing.

That was okay. Is okay.

My e-key worked when I tried it again. My groceries went into the fridge and I went into the shower with a forty and my dab pen. I came out feeling calmer and ready to stream. I don’t know what was in that pen, but it gave me the most vivid experience with my show. I’m feeling a kind of callback high even writing about it.

My room looked like my avatar’s virtual one. Honey combs and golden hexagonal decorations of all kinds that dripped with thick syrupy liquid from a new “bee” theme I was trying out. The avatar on my screen was a short, pudgy girl with acne scars. The same girl that had accidentally appeared in a big streamer's video once and was only noticed as a “butterface” in the chat. When I went live, none of my audience seemed to notice me and my avatar had switched places, so I kept the show going as usual.

In the middle of my show, during the easiest bit where I watch playlists of other people’s videos and react, I opened my window shutters to let some cool air in. Turning on my AC would have risked background noise that would have irritated enough of my audience enough to keep a few donations from coming. Right as the shutter went up, a donation came up on my screen.

From someone special. Be yourself. Love you.

My avatar and I froze. I should have expected this message to pop up on my feed, but it still made me numb with fear. I ran back to my desk to check the donation list, but it was gone. Nobody else in the chat had noticed it.

“Hey chat, I…”

I couldn’t find any words.

My room was my room again. Everything was normal. My avatar was in its place and I was in mine. The chat was flooded with jokes about my character being frozen. A few people were even concerned.

“Chat, I… I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.

“I’m sorry for being me. For lying to all of you, even the ones that tell themselves that I’m just another talking head on the internet. For the last year my life has been spiraling and I can’t take it anymore, okay? I just want all this to stop. I don’t want to be looked at anymore, I don’t want to ask for money anymore, and I don’t want to be coy and friendly with any of you just to build a relationship that gets me retention. All I’ve done, all any of us have done, is sell you a lie.”

“I want to go home. I’m scared.”

My finger clicked on the “end stream” button. I deleted the recording of the stream, my subreddit, and any other socials I could find relating to the character I had been for years.

When I was done, I saw a stack of papers on my counter.

My new contract. All the papers were signed, everything was ready to go. My new life was going to start whether I liked it or not. So I called my mom.

Usually our calls were brief, she knew I was busy and I knew that I didn’t want to talk to her if I could help it. I don’t even remember much of the conversation, except that I did a lot of crying and she did a lot of reassuring.

“Oh, I forgot to ask, did you ever get the letters I sent you?” she asked.

“I don’t think so, what letters?”

“Really!? I made sure to leave them on your door! As a surprise! I even left a little donation thingy on your show today, I know it was your last one before you hit the big leagues.”

Whatever she said after that, I don’t remember. I don’t want to remember. I ended the call chuckling. I threw the phone against the wall in the middle of laughing fits. Then I was struggling to breath from laughing and sobbing as I destroyed all of the equipment I’d saved and worked so hard for. My sobs hitched in my throat while I washed the blood from my scratched fingers and knuckles in a shower that I sat in for an hour and a half.

It doesn’t matter. In a week I’ll be in a big blue house with even fancier equipment.

What else could I ask for? What else do I deserve?

I guess you’ll see.

I won’t. In a week, I’ll be a distant memory, and I pray that the girl that is set to take my place can keep it together better than I could.",0,1768003644.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,0.5,False
1q8otk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesignAdvice/comments/1q8otk3/need_help_arranging_a_small_studio_floor_plan/,Need help arranging a small studio - floor plan attached,"Hi! I just rented a small studio and I’m trying to figure out the best furniture layout. I attached the floor plan (bathroom excluded).

The entrance is on the right side, the kitchen element is already fixed where shown on the plan. The entire left wall is windows, but they’re not floor-to-ceiling.

What I definitely need is a sofa that converts into a bed, a desk with an office chair, and a wardrobe or cabinet for clothes. I will probably also get a coffee table and a freestanding shelf. I like lamps and plants, so I will get those somewhere for sure. I'm open to buying other things as well.

I’m renting, so I guess I can’t drill or mount things on the walls.

I probably won’t have a TV. I might get a projector later, but I don’t want the whole layout to be designed around that.

I’m looking for layout ideas and placement suggestions that would work with this floor plan. Any general advice is also welcome!

Thanks!

1q8ot2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/6Perks/comments/1q8ot2q/the_vape_of_endless_possibilities/,The Vape of Endless Possibilities,"**A Smoke Shop at the End of the World.**

You were on a road trip to the coast with your friends. Your route had taken a detour (your buddy *insisted* that it was a shortcut), and you ended up on bumpy back-country roads, loose gravel and divots evoking discomforting rattles from your Corolla. The night itself was unremarkable. It was a humid summer, and your AC was on full blast; cicadas filled the air with their song, though it couldn't be heard over the engine; the sky was filled with endless stars. Still, you were lost, and had no idea where this road would take you. Even your buddy was losing confidence.

  
You arrived at a dead end. 40 miles of driving down this shitty road, only to end up needing to turn around? Most of your group was pissed. You parked the car, and everyone got out.

  
You were at the end of the road. Straight ahead was nothing but forest. The stars were gorgeous - you hadn't seen this many stars ever before in your life. But you were beginning to feel delirious from driving for so long, and discouraged by the massive setback. It felt bizarrely like you weren't just at the end of the road - this was the end of the *world*.

  
""What do you guys think that is?"" One of your friends called out. You looked over to where he was pointing. Through the dense trees, you first noticed the bright white lights - they looked fluorescent, which was an incongruous sight amidst so much nature. Looking closer, you could make out right angles, like the outline of a small 1-story building.

  
Everyone gathered around to peer into the forest. Soon, you were all making your way to the building. It wasn't far. Hesitantly, you stepped into a clearing, a 100-foot empty circle with a single building dead center.

  
""No way,"" someone whispered. ""What the fuck...""

  
**JADE DRAGON 24HR SMOKE SHOP**

  
It looked like someone, or something, had picked up a random smoke shop from the city and deposited it whole into the forest. A neon ""Open"" sign flashed through the barred windows. The door stood slightly ajar, and your group could hear electronic music coming from inside. 

  
""Should we go in?"" 

  
You felt inside your pocket, pulling out your Geek Bar. You tried to take a hit, and the battery flashed. Out of juice. 

  
Without waiting for the others, you stepped inside and walked up to the counter.



\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  
*There are 6 vapes available for purchase. You only have enough money for 1. Choose wisely.*

  
**1.** *Super-Mod XXL Gigawatt Smoke Factory:* A heavy monstrosity of a battery with pure tobacco-flavored juice. When you inhale, it acts like a normal vape. When you exhale, the amount of smoke produced is amplified based on the setting selected, a number between 1-5. At 1, there is no change. At 5, the cloud you exhale is utterly massive. A single exhale can produce enough smoke to smog in an area the size of a football field. The smoke is heavy and dense, reducing visibility to a few feet. It settles and is not easily dispersed by wind. 

Additionally, the Super-Mod XXL comes with a ""magic wand"" mode. When toggled on, a control panel appears on the side of the battery, which features several options. This includes the ability to ""grab"" any smoke exhaled with this vape, and manipulate it. The smoke can be moved by pointing with the vape; it can be shrunk or expanded; it can be ""deleted""; it can be ""locked into place""; and even more advanced options are available, allowing the smoke to take on complicated forms such as walls, 3D solids, tunnels/mazes, writing, and more. You can even change the color and create smoke animations.

(This vape can be refilled with any normal vape juice. The battery can be charged normally.)



**2.** *Herbalicious Remedy:* A vomit-green-colored vape, similar in size and shape to a geek bar. The logo depicts the smiling face of a monk surrounded by herbs and flowers. When you inhale, the flavor is like a smoothie made of raw greens, and the smoke somehow tastes thick. It's disgusting.

When you exhale, the smoke will rapidly accelerate the healing of any organic matter it touches. However, it only operates by *direct* contact. Some examples:

\- An open gash on someone's arm is infused with the smoke. The wound rapidly heals and seals in about 30 seconds. Because the smoke is able to touch every part of the injury, the healing is complete.

\- Someone has a cracked rib, and you breathe smoke onto their chest/torso. Any flaws in their skin heal instantly, but the rib remains cracked, because the smoke was not able to touch the actual bone.

\- A man lies dead in the street, a bullet hole in his head. No exit wound. You bring your lips close to the entry wound and fill the bullet hole with vape smoke. His head begins to stitch itself back together, his brain matter re-wiring itself, and the wound closes. You take another puff and breathe it into his open mouth. The smoke infuses his blood and internal organs, kick-starting his body back to life. However, the bullet remains inside his brain.

\- You breathe smoke onto a patch of dead grass on your lawn. The grass springs to life again almost immediately, restoring its verdant green color.

(This vape cannot be refilled. Once it is out of juice, it is used up. The amount of juice is similar to a 15000-puff Geek Bar.)

  
**3.** *Fantastically Familiar:* A small black vape pen with a silver skeletal dragon design printed on the front. The flavor evokes a sense of familiarity, like the flavor is one you should know, but can't quite place. It tastes like childhood nostalgia and fills you with a feeling of comfort.

When you take a hit, your creative thinking abilities kick into overdrive. You can visualize and imagine animals, creatures, and beings of any level of complexity. Personalities, moods, mannerisms and behavior become the substance of your thoughts, and creating an entire person with a life history seems trivial.

When you exhale, that creativity comes into play, as you mentally shape the smoke into a creature of your choosing. You form the body and mind of this smoke minion, create its personality, its desires, giving it a mind as full or as empty as you desire. You shape its body, controlling every aspect of its anatomy and function. However, there are some rules guiding this creation process.

The amount of smoke you use determines the maximum possible size, the density, and the lifespan of your creature. Since they are made of smoke, they do not live long before dissipating, and you need to pack the smoke densely if you want the being to live longer than an hour or so. A single puff could create a couple insect-sized creatures that last for mere minutes, whereas a hundred puffs could be used to shape a dense dog-sized animal that would last for a day. The denser the smoke, the longer your creation will exist. Density of smoke also influences how ""tangible"" your creation is, which gives it the ability to interact with the world and accomplish more physically difficult tasks.

With this vape, you can create minions that do tasks for you. You could also create a smoke human with its own personality and memories. The options are nearly limitless.

(This vape cannot be refilled. Once it is out of juice, it is used up. The amount of juice is small, the least of all vapes on this list. You must use it wisely.)



**4.** *Cumulonimbus:* A light blue vape of similar size and shape to a Geek Bar. There is an illustration of a fluffy white cloud on the side. It feels incredibly light - so much so that you might lose it easily if you're not careful. There is practically no flavor - it tastes light.

While inhaling, you will begin levitating, at half the acceleration of Earth gravity. It feels like you are falling upward - slowly at first, but getting faster rapidly. This upward acceleration continues as long as you are actively inhaling. 

When you stop, you will once again be under the power of Earth's gravity, but with a drastically reduced terminal velocity. So, you will start to fall back down, but your maximum velocity downward is about 10 mph/16 kph. This ""safety net"" for your fall is immediately terminated once you touch down on a solid object. 

Additionally, while you are midair, you can exhale the smoke in any direction to propel yourself in the opposite direction. For example, if you are falling and exhale facing forward, it will propel you so that you fall diagonally backward. The force with which you exhale determines the speed with which you are propelled. Exhaling upward to propel yourself downward while falling does not cause you to move faster than the safety net would allow. 

You can also hit the vape again while midair - in this way, by chaining multiple consecutive inhales, you can reach incredible heights.

(This vape cannot be refilled. Once it is out of juice, it is used up. However, there is a massive amount of juice, enough for 1,000,000 puffs.)

  
**5.** *Cup-O-Joe:* This vape doesn't look like a vape at all. It looks like a coffee mug with a lid and a spout. But when you inhale from the spout, it functions like a vape, and you taste the flavor of a full morning breakfast, complete with syrupy pancakes, fluffy scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and a cup of coffee. It fills you with the feeling that you just ate a delicious meal.

When you take a single puff of the Cup-O-Joe, it nourishes your body with exactly what it needs. The caloric and nutritional needs of a single ideal meal are met, and you feel well-fed. It will also hydrate and slightly energize you. If you take another puff immediately afterward, there will be no effect, because your body does not need any more calories, vitamins, hydration, or nutrition at that time. When used appropriately, and spaced throughout the day, this vape can replace all food and water that you consume. 

On the bottom of the coffee mug vape, you find that the base is actually a wheel that can be rotated between multiple settings, similar to a shower head with several modes. Currently, it is on the ""Meal & Water Replacement"" setting. There are two other settings.

The ""Sleep Replacement"" setting can be used to imbue your body with the benefits of a solid 8 hours of sleep in an instant. Again, this only has an effect if you are actually tired and in need of rest.

The ""Sober-Me-Up"" setting will clear the effects of all drugs from your system. Additionally, the Smart Technology (TM) of Cup-O-Joe will identify any medicines or necessary drugs in your system (such as insulin), and will choose not to mitigate those effects. Only the effects that you *want* removed - such as a hangover, a bad high, or caffeine overstimulation - will be neutralized.

All effects from each mode are achieved with a single puff.

(This vape cannot be refilled. Once it is out of juice, it is used up. The amount of juice is substantial, enough for 30,000 puffs.)

  
**6.** *Dope Fade Marmalade:* This vape looks like a high-tech bong. When you hit it, you taste a tangy, fruity flavor, with a bit of a kick. You exhale, and the smoke is ablaze with variegated color, a mini-disco of rainbow light and glimmers that swirls and dances before it dissipates.

With a single hit, you are microdosing. You will feel more connected to the people around you, you will be more sociable, and you will feel at ease and relaxed. It is a pleasant, mild high, that lasts for about 5-10 minutes. You can continue taking single puffs to keep the pleasant high going. The effect does not get weaker over time.

If you take multiple large consecutive hits, you will ""break through"" into the realm of collective human consciousness. The high from earlier was no mere high - you were slightly telepathic, picking up on the feelings and emotions of the people around you. Now that you've broken through, you are swimming in a proverbial sea of thoughts, connecting to and experiencing the internal worlds of all the people around you. If you take enough hits, you will be integrated with the minds of every living human.

The sea of minds is one you can learn to navigate, with practice. You can experience everything at a high level, the greatest waves in the ocean of collective thought; or, you can dive into specific minds, and explore a particular individual's life through their own eyes. You can relive people's memories, feel their emotions, and even experience their current thoughts as if they were your own. It is the ultimate tool for empathy and connection to other humans. 

(This vape cannot be refilled. Once it is out of juice, it is used up. The amount of juice is substantial, enough for 30,000 puffs.)

You and your 3 friends arrive at the coast with slightly heavier pockets. It was a long night of driving, but the time flew by after what you found, and the experience you all had together.

1q8osvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q8osvb/my_experience_as_a_vtuber/,My Experience as a VTuber,"“Real” doesn’t mean a lot these days, I know, but right now I need to hold onto whatever I can, whether it’s real or not.

People should learn that my career path isn’t sunshine and rainbows made of money. I wouldn’t wish the stress of this job on my worst enemy, but it won’t be long before I’m not even able to say that much.

In just a few days every aspect of my life is going to be under scrutiny from a corporation. Every part of my day is going to be carefully monitored, recorded, then projected around the world. My beautifully animated avatar that the company spent around $10,000 to make will speak with a voice that sounds nothing like my own. My private life and my public life will be interchangeable forever. I’m not saying that to get pity or sympathy, but rather just to emphasize how dangerous this job can be if you’re even lucky enough to make money from it. Even as I write this and the clonazepam kicks in, I’m not sure of how much I want to tell of my own experience outside of the reason you’re seeing this post on this specific site. From my perspective it’s the most horrifying moment of my life, but on the internet it’s barely even a bad day.


More than anything, I guess, I’ll just be honest with you. That's all I have. Just in case anyone out there can spread this and learn from my own experience.

The sad truth is that stalkers and creeps are just another occupational hazard of even being under any kind of social spotlight. That being said, I’ve put out so little on my main channel about my personal life that I don’t mind giving just a little run down on my life as a VTuber.

It started a week after I began attending the community college I’d quickly drop out of. Along with deleting every email I’ve ever had, the company I’m signing on with has done a very good job of erasing my presence from the internet. Even if there had been a way to track me down? There isn’t one now.

The first question I’m going to be asked, a question I’ve always asked myself, is if I did it for the money.

The answer, the honest one, is yes. Back in the late 10’s VTubers were starting to go viral on YouTube. In no time, clips stolen from their channels were circulating with millions of views. I liked the idea of being a faceless personality. I’d spent most of my life watching and writing about the stuff you used to get stuffed in a locker for liking. Plus my voice was cute enough, why not try and use it?

When I told my roommates (Camilla and Aspen) my idea, very nervous and sure they were going to shut me down, they didn’t care at all. In fact they said they’d support me no matter what and that it was a good idea to hop on the gravy train before it took off.

That night we sat in our living room and talked. The kitchen light was dim and cast shadows onto the blankets we’d draped up against the windows. The air was clogged with the haze of incense smoke and vapor from the dab pen we passed around. After I’d told them my battle plan, they liked the idea so much that they wanted to try it with me. They weren’t as into anime or games as I was, but they were theater majors with dreams of making it big. It didn't matter if the stage was virtual, any stage was good enough.

We got our practice by making YouTube channels with shitty little avatars of our real selves playing games with each other. We didn’t get more than a hundred views per video. It was still the most fun I’ve had in this “career.”

Neither of my roommates have reached out in the years since I was signed on to a company. Maybe their messages were drowned out by the hundreds that are shoved in my inbox every day. My biggest fear for a while was that they were behind what’s happened to me. Camilla was never that toxic, but Aspen?

Yeah, I can see her being jealous enough to make me jump at shadows. Let alone ruin my life.

Out of the three of us, Aspen was the one that wanted to break out the most, and through any means necessary. And on the internet, especially to a barely-legal teen (as she advertised herself,) there was definitely a way to get popular fast. Before long she even had a facebook page for her strip show. Y’know, the ones you used to see in all the porn ads back in the day.

I’ve always felt glad that I didn’t go the route she did. Every week me and Camilla could hear her gagging on dildos and playing up orgasms to a crowd that threw money at her. Both her and her audience ignored the way Aspen’s avatar looked ever-so-slightly disgusted at what she was forcing herself to do whenever she forgot to put a specific face on.

A few of her donors said they were going to find where she lived and “take her on an amazing date,” or some variation of that. Aspen bought a gun soon after, the rules of our lease be damned. That was the first time I felt like we could be watched. Not that someone was, but at the time it almost would’ve been better to rip that band aid off and just confirm it was happening.

No, feeling like you’re being watched in your daily life is so much worse. Every time I went to class or went shopping at any store, the image of some creep changing the pitch of my model’s voice changer to find my voice, then find me, had me looking over my shoulder constantly. Every glance from someone on the street was a potential creep. But I put up with it, because the money was good.

Even mild success on the internet can change your life. It’s the gamble dozens of people make every day when they create a new social media or YouTube channel. Me and my roommates' bets paid off. We moved out of the dorms and into a pretty nice city apartment. The rooms were even spread out enough so that I didn’t have to hear Aspen’s constant gagging or Camilla’s nervous breakdowns.

She wasn’t having them for no reason either. Despite being the least popular of us with only a few hundred constant viewers, she was the first to have fan mail. Only it was sent to an apartment nobody should even know exists.

Love you lots, keep doing your best!

The letter was covered in hearts, smiley faces, and drawings of Camilla’s avatar. All of this would have been okay if our address, not our PO box, was printed on top left of the envelope.

We moved. As fast as we could, as quietly as we could, we found an even better apartment that me and Aspen mostly paid for out of pity for Camilla.

A week later an envelope was taped to the front door.

Sorry! I’ll leave you alone, I won’t bother you, keep doing your best! I’m not a stalker, I swear, just your biggest fan. Love you lots!

Camilla went to the post office and, through a year’s worth of legal trouble and moving heaven and Earth to see justice done, found and got a restraining order on the not-stalker. A week later he hanged himself in his closet, but by then Camilla was jaded and on enough medications to handle the situation as well as she could: doing monetized streams and videos warning other VTubers and their communities of what not to do. She made a lot of money. Even more after she made her face public and started dedicated social media to her “real” self.

Me and Aspen had long moved out by that point. She’s been doing pretty good. She does regular streams where her fancy 3D model quivers and thrusts against something-or-other with horrible tracking and no expression. She makes thousands of dollars every week. Forget a button that shoots dopamine in your system, why not a button that makes a girl moan for the low price of ten dollars?

Then came an agent. Then a manager, then public events and collaborations and a circus that has me as the centerpiece. Or, rather, my human corpse stapled to my avatar. And all of the other girls in these collabs dance, sing, and play into the jokes of their respective chats. Behind all of the hefty breasts and exposed midriffs, though, are girls in empty apartments with cumbersome tracking equipment weighing them down.

Our avatars wore revealing exercise clothes the last time this happened. We all made sure the cameras were pointed at the right angles and, as always, told our audience that we loved them with a virtual wink before we all signed off and were left standing, alone, in our empty apartments. Or maybe in their case, massive, expensive houses.

I’d assumed the letter I got a week or two ago came from her. Maybe even Camilla. They both resented me for being the first to sign on to the first English-speaking big-shot corporation emerging out of the VTube space. Funny thing about those companies, despite the tens of thousands of donations you get on stream, they almost never implement a donation limit. I didn’t have one, and never will, but it was always something you’d see some incel post about on Reddit. I’d actually just got done doing an anonymous dive into my own subreddit when I thought I heard someone knock on my apartment door.

There was a pink envelope taped to my door, long after I’d quit using a PO box and long after I’d stopped giving any sort of clue who I could be.

So proud of you! Been there since the beginning, love you!

It was typed, not handwritten like Camilla’s letter had been. There weren’t any smiley faces or drawings of my avatar either.

I’ve only left my apartment once since getting that letter, after I’d run out of anything to eat. My apartment was my universe. I log into my desktop, edit videos for five hours, eat whatever food I ordered, and continue to edit or do my show for five hours, then sleep.

Walks to the gas station used to be part of that routine. So did daily showers and phone calls with my mom.

Anything outside of that is just screens and sleep. The few times I could hear my slippers slapping against concrete and hear the noise of the city were a treasure. I miss them. The last one I took was what really made me want to write and post this.

I hadn’t showered, shaved, or flossed in a week. But I wanted, needed, to get out of my apartment. Ignore your human instinct all you want, but eventually your impulses win. By then I was eating a few gummies any time I drew the shades open, so I got pretty fucked up before my last trip to the gas station.

“Have a good day! Love you!”

It’s a fact that the cashier didn’t say this to me on the way out. I heard it anyway. As clear as the sound of my fingers hammering into this keyboard, I heard someone at the back of the store say those words. Maybe someone else did. At the time it was a lot easier to say I was having an episode and to get home as fast as I could.

So I ran back, the whole thing a mess of kaleidoscope eyes and idiot brain that I don’t remember at all.

The dull thunk of my doorknob refusing to turn snapped me back into focus.

Oh shit.

Oh SHIT!

My e-card came out of my wallet, which I just pressed to the door and usually worked fine, and I swiped it across the reader again. The light above the knob flashed red. I swiped it again.

And again.

And again.

I was crying when I finally let go of the doorknob. Drinks and food spilled out of the bags and we collapsed to the floor together. My sleeves were covered in snot and tears. Nobody had come out of their apartments to see what the commotion was.

All I could think to do was find someplace to sit and… I don’t know. Just sit. Nobody was in the complex’s lobby so I picked the closest faux-leather chair and sat. A few more tears came out but mostly I sat still, watching the cheap books on the cheap coffee table swirl in front of the unlit fireplace. But, for just a second, I was able to relax and look at the world as if it were a blurry painting that occasionally shifted colors. I could just sit still and wait for something to wake me up.

The elevator, stairwell, and front doors to the lobby were really loud. But I didn’t hear her open any of them. I blinked.

There she was, sitting next to me.

She looked exactly like my avatar had in the early days.

Black hair, olive skin just a few shades darker than mine, and a white dress. More distinguishing features came later to make more of an attempt to stand out.

For a second she was really there. Then I felt something held against my ear, and she was speaking with my manager’s voice.

“I’ll be over in an hour. I’m so excited for you XXXXX.”

A hisssssss came from behind me. One of the complex’s staff was making a cup of coffee and more than a little had dropped and sizzled on the heating pad. I hadn’t noticed her come in either.

“I feel like I’m freaking out,” I said with a flat voice. The world in front of me was still swirling and I could hardly focus. “I swear there’s a stalker. You saw how similar the letter was to Camilla’s.”

A homeless man came into the lobby and warmed himself by the fireplace. The sight was a dark, grey, oceanic wave in my vision that seemed all at once scary and calming. No doubt my oversized t-shirt with a faded mouse and matching pajama bottoms made me look homeless myself.

“We’re already taking care of that with your apartment’s staff, I’ve reminded you a dozen times now. They’re just trying to identify him with the other buildings in your area. We’ll have a warrant for his arrest in no time.”

“But I feel so… watched.”

“You’re going to get that feeling every now and then, there’s no helping it. You’re a public figure, even if only a handful of your fans can even guess your identity.”

With some effort I made myself sound like I was reluctantly agreeing with her.

“Just take a deep breath,” she said through my avatar. Her voice sounded like mine now. “Take your medicine. It’ll be okay. We’ll talk about it when I get there. Love you lots.”

She was gone. The lobby was empty.

Nobody had touched my little pile of groceries by the time I made it back to my apartment. A bottle of diet soda helped wash down more of my panic attack medication.

“Excuse me?” Someone said from behind me.

The soda and medication going down hit a wall of air from my lungs trying to come out as a scream. When I turned around, I would swear that the guy was the same one that worked at the gas station I went to for quick food.

“I’m so sorry!” He said, backing away and putting his hands up to prove he wasn’t a threat. The hallway behind him was a mirage of brown and beige that undulated, forcing me to hold onto my doorknob to keep my balance. Vomit curled up into my already clogged throat.

With a reflex I’d developed for doing my online show, I smiled. It was the perfect mask for my avatar if I happened to feel any genuine sadness or anger. For everything pre-planned, I had many emotions programmed to certain buttons on my software.

“I’m so sorry,” the guy said again. He was almost shaking. “I live down the hallway. I just wanted to let you know that someone’s been watching you the last few times you were at my work, the, uh, gas station down the street. I thought you’d… Want to know?”

The asshole didn’t even give me the dignity of saying anything back. Just scampered off down the hall into one of the apartments.

“Thanks, I appreciate it,” I said to nothing.

That was okay. Is okay.

My e-key worked when I tried it again. My groceries went into the fridge and I went into the shower with a forty and my dab pen. I came out feeling calmer and ready to stream. I don’t know what was in that pen, but it gave me the most vivid experience with my show. I’m feeling a kind of callback high even writing about it.

My room looked like my avatar’s virtual one. Honey combs and golden hexagonal decorations of all kinds that dripped with thick syrupy liquid from a new “bee” theme I was trying out. The avatar on my screen was a short, pudgy girl with acne scars. The same girl that had accidentally appeared in a big streamer's video once and was only noticed as a “butterface” in the chat. When I went live, none of my audience seemed to notice me and my avatar had switched places, so I kept the show going as usual.

In the middle of my show, during the easiest bit where I watch playlists of other people’s videos and react, I opened my window shutters to let some cool air in. Turning on my AC would have risked background noise that would have irritated enough of my audience enough to keep a few donations from coming. Right as the shutter went up, a donation came up on my screen.

From someone special. Be yourself. Love you.

My avatar and I froze. I should have expected this message to pop up on my feed, but it still made me numb with fear. I ran back to my desk to check the donation list, but it was gone. Nobody else in the chat had noticed it.

“Hey chat, I…”

I couldn’t find any words.

My room was my room again. Everything was normal. My avatar was in its place and I was in mine. The chat was flooded with jokes about my character being frozen. A few people were even concerned.

“Chat, I… I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.

“I’m sorry for being me. For lying to all of you, even the ones that tell themselves that I’m just another talking head on the internet. For the last year my life has been spiraling and I can’t take it anymore, okay? I just want all this to stop. I don’t want to be looked at anymore, I don’t want to ask for money anymore, and I don’t want to be coy and friendly with any of you just to build a relationship that gets me retention. All I’ve done, all any of us have done, is sell you a lie.”

“I want to go home. I’m scared.”

My finger clicked on the “end stream” button. I deleted the recording of the stream, my subreddit, and any other socials I could find relating to the character I had been for years.

When I was done, I saw a stack of papers on my counter.

My new contract. All the papers were signed, everything was ready to go. My new life was going to start whether I liked it or not. So I called my mom.

Usually our calls were brief, she knew I was busy and I knew that I didn’t want to talk to her if I could help it. I don’t even remember much of the conversation, except that I did a lot of crying and she did a lot of reassuring.

“Oh, I forgot to ask, did you ever get the letters I sent you?” she asked.

“I don’t think so, what letters?”

“Really!? I made sure to leave them on your door! As a surprise! I even left a little donation thingy on your show today, I know it was your last one before you hit the big leagues.”

Whatever she said after that, I don’t remember. I don’t want to remember. I ended the call chuckling. I threw the phone against the wall in the middle of laughing fits. Then I was struggling to breath from laughing and sobbing as I destroyed all of the equipment I’d saved and worked so hard for. My sobs hitched in my throat while I washed the blood from my scratched fingers and knuckles in a shower that I sat in for an hour and a half.

It doesn’t matter. In a week I’ll be in a big blue house with even fancier equipment.

What else could I ask for? What else do I deserve?

I guess you’ll see.

I won’t. In a week, I’ll be a distant memory, and I pray that the girl that is set to take my place can keep it together better than I could.",1,1768003557.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

   Upon returning from the gray fog, Emily thought of multiple things, but what caught her attention the most was the guy in the metal armor she met in the grey fog; she didn’t actually believe that a sane person would fall for the mystery lemon prank.

‘ At least I got 100 pounds from that, I just need to go make those potions and sacrifice them to Mr.Fool ‘.

She left the dorm and wandered around the city for a bit, entered a coffee shop, and ordered a small cup of coffee.

After finishing her coffee, she decided to make those potions that the knight ordered, and started to walk towards natrus’s laboratory.

On her way there, she noticed a cat sleeping on a public bench. She approached the cat to pet it, but the cat suddenly jumped and hissed at her before running away.

‘ Sigh I need to advance to beast tamer as soon as possible, I can’t take this anymore! ’.

‘ But I have to digest the rest of the potion first, hmmmm’.

She thought for a bit, eventually she came up with a plan.

‘ Oh, Prof. Aron needed assistance with the potions he was making, if i help him finish those 
I’ll digest the rest of the potion and make the potions for that knight at the same time, 
I'm such a genius’. 

‘ I’ll finally be able to adopt a cat. What should I name him? Her?’.

‘How haven't I thought about this before?’

She was somewhat disappointed with herself.

She sighed and stood there for a while.

‘Whatever, just finish the matters at hand first’.

She began walking to the laboratory, admiring the beautifully constructed buildings, they were decorated with exquisite symbols that looked familiar, she just couldn't remember where she had seen them.

Upon reaching the lab, she knocked on the door and entered, prof. Aron could be seen filling in some documents while keeping an eye on the medicine he was preparing in the cauldron, she felt somewhat sad due to prof. Smith’s absence, but she didn’t come today seeking him.

Prof. Aron looked miserable, as if he had been working non stop for several days straight, his face was pale and his eyes were swollen.

He didn't even notice Emily enter the lab until she stood before him, before he could say anything Emily said with a warm smile, “ Greetings prof. Aron, I would like to offer you something”. 

“ How about you let me finish this delivery of yours, and you go rest for a bit ?”, she asked.

 Aron stared at her for a moment, confused as to why she would ask that, instead of answering her he asked, “ what do you get from helping me ?”.

She raised 5 fingers and said with a confident smile on her face, “I'm not asking for much, just let me make 5 potions and we have a deal, of course the materials will be provided by you”.

Aron stared at her again for a while, evaluating the situation and answered while skeptically looking at her, “ Yeah sure I don't mind, but you have to finish the rest of the delivery before tomorrow. Would you be able to do that, young lady?”

Emily scoffed and answered,” Of course, it won't be that hard”.

Aron was too tired to care, but he didn't want to miss the deadline, so he told her that he would be back in a few hours to check on her and left to rest.

After prof. Aron left the laboratory, Emily picked up the list of the things she needed to make.

‘ Medicine, enhancing and healing potions, sil-silednafil ? What's that? At least the recipe is written here’.

She looked around to make sure that no one was watching before saying out loud, “ Jesse, Let's cook!”.

A few hours passed, Emily was still cooking the potions on the list, she heard someone knocking on the door.

‘ Prof. Aron ? it has only been a few hours since he left’.

The door opened revealing a blond man in a vest. It was Aster, he entered and looked around as if searching for something or someone, he noticed Emily and approached her.

“ Is stirring cauldrons the only thing you do?”, he asked with a cheeky smile.

“Uhhh…..maybe”.

“Pfft”, Aster started laughing.

She let out a small chuckle and asked, “ what brings you here ?”

“ I’m looking for Prof. Smith. Do you know where I can find him?”

“ No, I haven’t seen him today, You can leave him a message though”.

“ Just tell him that Sir Mendel wants to meet him”.

“ Otto Mendel ?”, she asked.

“ Yeah, it seems that there are a few troublesome people on the ship, be careful on your way home”, Aster said in a serious tone.

“ Alright, I'll keep that in mind”, She frankly replied.

“ Anyways, I’ll take my leave, I’ll go look for prof. Smith, see you around”, he said as he turned around and walked away.

“Bye”.

"" That's weird, I need to focus on finishing these first”.

…

A few more hours passed, prof Aron came back to find Emily sorting out everything in their respective boxes, he was astonished at the fact that a mere seq 9 managed to do such a task.

He walked up to her and said, “ Well done, Emily. You actually saved me this time”. 

She shook her head,” It's all a part of our deal, no need to thank me”, she then added,” Could you please show me where I can make my advancement application?”

“...You digested your potion?” Aron asked.

“Yes, and I would like to advance as soon as possible”.

Aron looked at her, then raised his hand and touched his glabella and checked her thoroughly on the spot.

He deactivated his spirit vision and asked her,” Do you have enough contribution points?”

“Yeah, I think I do”.
 
“Then follow me”.

In real life, most quilts come together in starts and stops. A productive weekend, a busy work week, a stretch where it sits folded over a chair, a moment of doubt, another cup of coffee, and then—eventually—momentum again.

Most of us are just trying to clear a small path in the forest of life to make room for this hobby we love. Some days the path is wide and quiet. Other days it’s overgrown, messy, and hard to find—but we show up anyway when we can.

The quiet truth is that progress doesn’t look the same for everyone. Your pace doesn’t need to match that of others. The quilt doesn’t care how long it takes—only that you come back to it when you’re ready.

Maybe what we need more of are no-filter quilt journeys—the imperfect seams, the stalled projects, the real process that happens between the highlight photos. Slow quilts aren’t failed quilts. They’re just made by people living full lives.

There's not many reviews from owners of this machine so I used some blind faith with my pick. I'm happy to answer any questions about the machine.

First a shout out to Whole Latte Love for fast shipping and excellent customer service. I had a couple issues with assembly and something else I purchased and they were awesome with the help.

Second an  F U to Bezzera for the shameful tamper they include with the machine. Either include a decent tamper (and frothing pitcher) or don't but don't insult customers of a $2500 machine with the plastic piece of shit you include.

My current daily is cheaply ground French press iced coffee in the morning and an inconsistent espresso from a local cafe or my Nanopreso in the afternoon. I'm interested in both a consistently decent tasting espresso and also learning about how brewing affects flavor. My unicorn is a combo of a Kees Van Der Western with a Ceado grinder combined into a super-automatic with the ability to both profile shots like a Decent and just press a button and get a great coffee all for under $5000. Since that doesn't exist, after extensive research I ended up choosing the Duo De paired with a Eureka Atom 65W. The Brevelle Oracle would probably be a very good (perhaps better) machine for me too but, I didn't want to be shamed on Reddit for buying and all-in-one and superficially, I wanted a machine made in Italy.

I'm just getting used to the machine but I will say, volumetric dosing is awesome. It makes adjusting flavor really easy because the pull is always the same so you can adjust other parameters like grind size or dose and easily taste the adjustment.

I can't comment on the steaming as I don't drink milk drinks.

I'll update this in the future when I become an expert with the machine.

Just wondering what the experience was like for other parents and their kids with epilepsy? My son is 15 (and I know electronics have to be on airplane) and since he can bring his laptop and gaming stuff, he’ll be super happy as it’s way more gaming time than he’s usually allowed.  I’m the one just dreading the stay so much. I’d rather have an arm cut off than watch him having tonic clonics and though intellectually I understand he’s in the safest place possible to be having a seizure, I can’t get my nervous system to understand that. Also, since I can only leave his bedside for 30 min per day, I can’t go on a walk, use the meditation room or go grab a coffee outside of those 30 min so most of my go-to hospital coping mechanisms aren’t an option this time.

I’d just love to hear anything you have to share about an EMU stay 🙏",1,1768002584.0,Epilepsy,1,1.0,False

These mugs aren't commercially available where I live, but last year I had three friends who went to Nordic countries, one to Finland, one to Norway, and one to Denmark and I managed to get them to bring me some souvenirs. 

I recently acquired the last mug from a used goods website here in my country. There isn't a day that goes by that I drink my coffee from one of these mugs and don't feel happy; in fact, one of them helped me a lot during a very difficult time in my life last year.",31,1768002417.0,Moomins,0,1.0,False

1q8oble,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1q8oble/update_i_finally_went_to_sephora/,Update: I Finally Went to Sephora.,"Update to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/s/GgdgeI01YD

1. I went to Sephora with the goal
of smelling/testing perfumes. 

*1a- I tried the following:
DG Devotion
DG Devotion Intense
MJ Perfect Intense
DC Mochi Milk
Burberry Her Elixir 
Burberry Goddess
TF Lost Cherry
TF Fig 
TF Vanille Fatale
AG LoveNotes Plush Vanilla
DBIR Intense

2. It was a ZOO. Every 12-15 teen girl/couple in my city appeared to be in the store with me and we were ALL there to smell all of the things all AT THE SAME TIME.

3. It was very overwhelming and loud. I felt more and more ancient as the minutes ticked on. I would never have been allowed or had the money to shop at a store like Sephora that young. I’m all for good skin care and think makeup is a perfectly healthy form of self-expression, but it did make me worry about all these children’s sense of self/confidence- running around buying eye cream & concealer… I lasted about 90 minutes.

4. My phone had shit signal, so I wasn’t able to check out all your reccs. Sorry, gang!
They were also out of A LOT. 
Help was brief and when I asked for samples, they looked at me like I asked for blood. Do they not do samples anymore?

5. I did my best to spray on tester, in cap and on skin, smelling coffee grounds in between.

*5a. Some of the perfumes smelled like nothing on all 3.
**5b. Some smelled good on paper, not on skin, some smelled like nothing on paper but warmed on skin, some smelled like nothing on skin.

6. The smells:
DG Devotion: nothing but alcohol and Citrus, No

DG Devotion Intense: Slightly sweet with a really artificial hazelnut, No

MJ Perfect Intense: Warm, a little fruity/Woody but missing something, Questioning

DC Mochi Milk: Warm woody, a little spicy, a touch sweet, Liked

Burberry Her Elixir: Crunch Berries & milk, No. Not a bad smell but too artificial for me.

Burberry Goddess: Sweet, a tinge spicy, a bit floral, Liked

TF Lost Cherry: Got nothing

TF Fig : Again, Nothing

TF Vanille Fatale: Vaguely Spiced Nothing

DBiR Intense: Alcohol and maybe a whisp of Jasmine? No.

AG LoveNotes Plush Vanilla:  A bit caramelized/candied at first, but settled to a sweet/ creamy vanilla and bit of sandalwood. Liked

7. Bought Travels of Burberry Goddess, DedCool Mochi Milk & Ari Plush Vanilla. Tried all 3 separately as a full day wear.

*7a. Goddess smelled lovely in the air in my room. Vanilla, Spicy, a little floral. On my skin- it dries down to a light citrusesque lavender, no vanilla! Barely any longevity.
**7b. Mochi smelled woody and warm, slightly sweet in the air, dried down on skin to a light, unisex warm woody scent, no sweetness/fluffiness at all. Decent longevity.
***7c. Plush smelled sweet and warm in the air, dried down on skin as a warm and sweeter/creamy feminine vanilla scent, but sexy, not foody. Great longevity.

8. Verdict:
I REALLY like AG LoveNotes Vanilla Plush. I tried it as a whim, because I’d never tried her scents before & it was the winner of the bunch, go figure. I bought a 50 ml of it on EBay. Got compliments already!

Was really disappointed in Mochi and Goddess, because they weren’t at all the sweet fluffy or rich vanillas I had hoped for. Scent is wild. 

I still hope to venture to Ulta, so I can update if that happens!

Jr. Adapted from the Broadway hit that Time Out New York hailed as ""the funniest musical comedy in at least 400 years,"" Something Rotten! Jr. celebrates one undeniable truth: “nothing’s as amazing as a musical!"". In the 1590s, brothers Nick and Nigel Bottom are desperate to write a hit play but are stuck in the shadow of that Renaissance rock star known as ""The Bard."" When a local soothsayer foretells that the future of theatre involves singing, dancing and acting at the same time, Nick and Nigel set out to write the world’s very first musical. But amidst the scandalous excitement of opening night, the Bottom Brothers realize that reaching the top means being true to thine own self, and all that jazz. ""Something Rotten! JR."" features large song and dance numbers, and a wacky cast of over-the-top characters, each with their own moment to shine. Tickets can be purchased with cash or card at the door. Concessions, 50/50 raffle tickets and merchandise will also be available for purchase by cash only. The show is rated PG and runs about 1 hour and 30 minutes with one 15 minute intermission.

The one to bring home to family, build a life together. Looking for a deep connection to each other, and the home we build together. I like a traditional, quiet country life. Ideally I’d be a recluse from society and hunt/fish/garden every day. 

I love intelligent conversation, enjoying the outdoors, and the light in a young horses eye when you can tell they’re learning. I spend hours a day listening to old country music, or a true crime podcast.

Is this kind of life for you? Millions of stars at night, coffee with farmers, throwing hay out on a dark cold night. If so please message me! I’d love to talk to anyone, anywhere. Even if this isn’t exactly what you’re looking for. 

Animal lovers are a huge plus, your pic gets mine, and you can see my animals too! Look forward to talking. Reddit chat is OK but discord is way better for me. Maybe even Snapchat? I’m in the ozarks, and if it gets really serious I’m looking for you to relocate here. ",1,1768002090.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1q8o7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q8o7at/the_photo_that_wasnt_taken/,The photo that wasn’t taken,"I found a camera under a park bench on my way home. The first photo it printed showed my mom lying on the kitchen floor. I checked the timestamp. Monday. I hadn’t been in the kitchen. I hadn’t touched anything. I stared at the print like it could explain itself. It didn’t.

The camera was cold and heavy in my hands. The lens caught the light like it was watching me. I set it on the counter, but my fingers kept twitching toward it. Summer photography class. TikTok clips. Montreal. Moving out. My chest tightened thinking about leaving home, and I didn’t know which was worse: the camera, or everything it was showing me.

Click. The first print slid out. Coffee had spilled across Mom’s notebook, ink bleeding into the paper. I double-checked. No one else had been in the apartment. Nothing explained this. I laughed, sharp and hollow, trying to convince myself it was a trick. But deep down I knew it wasn’t.

The next morning, sketchbook pages had curled, and a pen rolled across the floor. I hadn’t touched anything. The smell of paper and ink hit me like smoke. Just photos. Nothing more, I told myself.

By midweek, things escalated. A chair tipped over. My laptop cracked. A print from the camera showed the same scene from last week, but slightly off. My pulse was hammering.

I spun for TikTok. Click. Print: me crouched, face buried in my hands, crying. I hadn’t done it. But it smelled like me — shampoo, sweater, hallway.

I tried spilling juice on purpose. Print: my secret handwriting, something I had hidden for years. Fingers shaking, I shoved it under my pillow.

Text from my girlfriend: “Move-in tomorrow! Can’t wait!” Another print slid out: a confession I had never sent. My heart thumped so hard it hurt.

Thursday. Everything was subtly wrong. Chair slightly moved, pen on the wrong side, curtains crooked. Print on the counter: me staring at a letter I hadn’t written. My smile cracked. Someone was watching.

Night. Cross-legged on the floor, camera on my knees. Print: bedroom door ajar, shadow stretching. Hoodie figure, face hidden. Hands pressed against the wall. I hadn’t taken this photo yet.

Footsteps outside my room. Pulse jagged. Click. Print: apartment from the ceiling, spilled juice, cracked laptop, tipped chair. Mom looking straight at me — alive. Empty eyes. Monday said she was gone. Funeral photos, hospital visits. She shouldn’t be here.

Friday. One last experiment. Camera pointed at me texting my girlfriend. Print: me frozen, phone dropped, grin gone. Timestamp five minutes.

I backed toward the window. Print slid across the floor. Me, doorway, eyes wide, empty. Exactly where I was.

Creak. Apartment smelled of coffee, ink, metallic tang. Heart kicked against my ribs.

Whir-click. Click. Print: hallway stretched impossibly long. Shadows pooled, folding. Hoodie figure pressed against the wall, moving forward.

I dropped it, but the shutter didn’t stop. Knees hit the carpet.

Whir-click. Last print: Mom smiling in the doorway. Wrong. Too wide. Too patient. The room behind me empty. Chair toppled, notebook open, prints scattered. No me.

The camera whirred one last time. The print slid out, face down, waiting. ",1,1768002016.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

1q8o6ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1q8o6ok/apartment_fire/,Apartment fire,"Location: Pennsylvania
Hello! 

I’m in Pa and I lived in an apartment. One morning at work I got a call and it was my landlord saying my apartment caught fire. I rushed back and the fire was taken care of and it was contained in only my apartment. Fire damaged the kitchen and smoke damaged the other rooms. 

I talked to the fire Marshall and police about my morning routine ( I woke up, go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, get dressed and leave. I do not make breakfast or coffee, hell I don’t even bring a lunch to work) I woke up and 10 minutes later I was out the door. The fire Marshall said the fire started on top of the oven and that since the oven knobs we’re burned off they couldn’t tell for sure but they said the fire started due to my air fryer being on top of the oven. My first response was that I didn’t use it and that I only went in the kitchen to get to the bathroom. 

After a lot of talking the fire Marshall said that  he ruled it as an accidental fire and that I must’ve bumped into the air fryer as I was getting ready for work, and 20 minutes later they received a call about my smoke alarms going off. 

All things considered my landlords were super understanding and have been very nice about everything going on. The only issue was that I didn’t have renters insurance. This is something that I completely forgot when getting my apartment and never thought of, my landlords also did not check that I had it so there was no instance that I was told to get it. Most of my belongings were destroyed but it was my first apartment so I didn’t have much that was too expensive, I’m willing to acknowledge that it’s on me that I won’t be reimbursed for my stuff. 

A month later (now) my landlords insurance company is stating on a letter, that I am liable for damages and that since I don’t have insurance, they want to talk with me as soon as possible and if I don’t reach out within 30 days, they “may” seek to take legal action. Family members told me that this is a scare tactic that the insurance company is trying to get some money out of me, but the thing is I just got my first adult job and so far only have a couple thousand saved, so I don’t know what the insurance company thinks they are gonna get out of me. They would spend more in legal fees then what’s in my savings. 

My question is do I ignore it like my family is telling me or what should I do? Any advice is appreciated. ",2,1768001972.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

I was a die-hard [FantasySurfer.com](http://FantasySurfer.com) (RIP) player for 20 years. I commissioned club houses, came in 5th overall one year and managed to win a signed Al board for coming out on top in one of the Tahiti events (still have that board today!).

  
Welcome to [https://www.fantasysurfingleague.com/en/](https://www.fantasysurfingleague.com/en/)

There are some great games out there. [Surfival League](https://www.surfival-league.com/) has a sick end-of-season prize. The [WSL](https://fantasy.worldsurfleague.com/) site offers up live scoring and a free webcast. The newcomer [The Fantasy Surf Tour](https://thefantasysurftour.com/) looks very clean and promising. For stats, analysis and pure raw data, [Old Surf Dad](https://www.oldsurfdad.com/) and the [Lord Kookington](https://www.lordkookington.com/) sites are next level. I will continue to play them all but wanted to launch my own version with a vision.

We have created a game that is:

1. Easy to play.
2. Awards regional / event inspired prizes all season long.
3. Free.

We (my amazing developer and I) have spent way too many hours over coffee and breakfast trying to get this site dialed. I want to also thank the beta testers (SD and DMP) who went over each page with us and pointed out the Good, the Bad and the Ugly . Special thanks to David Levinson as well.

The 2025 season will remain OPEN until the CS season wraps up and we have the 2026 CT roster locked in. Until then, pick a team, check your score, and get a feel for the game. We really like the way it looks and functions.

If you see ANY bugs or have any comments, feel free to drop us a line. Happy to look at any constructive criticism. In the meantime, we are in contact with surf shops, artists, and other creators all over the world to lock in some amazing regional and event inspired prizes. If you care to donate, every little bit helps. The funds will support the site, and all involved.

Appreciate you joining us along for the ride. Gonna be sick for sure.

1q8o417,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8o417,Jab Tak Hai Jaan (Watched for first time),"In my silsila discussion on this sub, someone mentioned jthj as its actual plot and that plot of jthj was the actual plot for silsila but it couldn't go that way because of some circumstances?

Khair

Today i watched the film and then read the reddit reviews of the film and honestly its not half bad, atleast not as much these reviews

Maybe because i hated silsila and was expecting the same experience, ofcourse it was better.

The only similarity i saw tho was of the, no reason accidents, 😭😭 seriously, whats with the accidents?? In silsila those fuckers couldn't drive a vehicle, here they cant walk on roads
The first one was fine then the second was so abrupt and comical that i laughed, not only on the nature of the accident but also on how much London apparently hates Rahul😭😭

Dawg was in London for 30 mins and got into another accident, lost his memory n everything..

But yea still not as half bad as silsila 

Good things? I loved brooding older sharukh, he looked sounded amazing, that elevated the film and for the first time i saw SRK's appeal in looks.

Hated Anushka's character but thats on me i just hate these type of characters and just watched ae dil hai mushkil so im already on a high from that type of characters 

Baaki katrina and her acting? Someone compared it to nargis from Rockstar and i beg to differ, nargis couldn't say one dialogue properly, kat was fine but ofcourse not the best, aish, bebo would've been great here imo.


Something that bothered me was sharukh throwing coffee disposables on such a good scenic mountain so he could kiss kat, shit felt so stereotypically indian.

All in all, not the best film to start 2026 with but a fine a film.",1,1768001790.0,bollywood,4,0.56,False
1q8o405,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q8o405/update_i_think_im_being_framed_and_idk_what_to_do/,[update] I think I’m being framed and idk what to do,"I could barely focus at work today. I wouldn’t have even gone in if it weren’t for the flooding... my rentals are expensive and I can’t ruin them. Today is the only time I’ve ever been tempted to hire outside help, but this is a business, and I need to pull it together. I just need a distraction. 

The sobering smell of human waste is usually plenty to hold my attention, so I don’t see why constantly trying not to vomit wouldn’t be enough, but still, I can’t get rid of the feeling that something is just… off. It’s so hard to explain. I have so much anxiety all the time so I know what that feels like, and this is kind of like that, but also not. Everything feels like it’s not real, maybe? Normal, everyday things just don’t feel normal. I rushed through the flooding cleanup until it was good enough to leave for tomorrow. I needed to be alone. 

I went back to my office and opened the mini fridge. I was greeted with every sauce I’ve ever been given by a fast food place but nothing to drink. I guess I forgot to restock the fridge yesterday. Normally I would run to the store to get something cold but I honestly just need to be alone. I grabbed a warm can and took a sip, but just like everything else, it just… isn’t… *right.* Obviously canned margaritas aren’t as good warm, but it tastes kind of wrong? It just tastes slightly worse than normal, I don’t know. I lifted the can to check the expiration date, but it should still be good for the next 3 months. Fine to drink then, just unpleasant. I did the only thing any reasonable person would and chugged it. Bottoms up. 

The second wasn’t better. Or the third. None of them were spoiled, they just were slightly worse than warm? I’m not sure what to do with myself. Something is just not right. I looked down at the clock and saw it was almost 2:30pm… I could go pick up the kids! They will be super excited to get a ride home instead of having to go to daycare and take the bus home! It took about 20 minutes, but I was there to pick them up on time and everything!

They aren’t excited. They’re looking at me like I’ve done something wrong, like I’m a monster? 

“Daddy, did you pick us up because Kyra was kill’ded?”

I’m not panicking, I can’t be panicking. I am a great father and I also need to focus on driving.

Stay focused.

Stay focused.

STAY FOCUSED.

Fuck, wait, you need to respond to your kid. What are you even doing?

“Where did you hear that?”

The blood rushing through my ears made it almost impossible to hear what Andrew said. I think he said something about Scaught whatever-the-fuck-last-name. I’ll never remember his last name, he’s just the stupid kid with the stupid name who always has all of the gossip regardless of whether it’s real. Yes, they spell ‘Scott’ as ‘Scaught.’ I hate the new generation. Once I made him repeat it, I heard it clear as day.

“Where is Kyra?”

I guess you can’t have blood rushing through your ears if your heart stops.

“Why are you asking about her now? We haven’t seen her in a long time.” It was so hard not to let out a disingenuous laugh, but I was afraid Andrew would think it was a scoff. It would have been a scoff. It was hard not to.

“Scaught said she died. Is Kyra died? Is that why you went to the police today?”

“You know Scaught makes up stories. I went with the police today because I wanted to help them catch a bad guy.”

“But you seemed mad”

“I wasn’t mad, I was serious because it’s always important to help the police. It’s always important. We always help the police if they ask for help.”

“Okay, Daddy. Can I tell you about the book we’re reading in class?”

“I’d love to hear about it!”

I could not tell you what that book was about to save my life. I want to be a good dad but it’s just so boring! Kyra scolded me for it once. Not actually scolding, more like your boss who is “just one of the guys” who smiles while they tell you that you did something wrong. They don’t have to even be mean for you to know you are being scolded, even while they smile like Barbies. If anything, it’s worse because they are just being so fake, like that one robot they had on all of the talk shows however long ago. It just doesn’t feel right. 

Things didn’t get better when we got home. I had a shit awful day and wanted to treat myself and my family to a special night because I’ve earned a treat, but my wife just doesn’t *get* me. 

“We are **_not_** going out to celebrate Kyra’s death!?”

“We aren’t celebrating anything! I just had a hard day and wanted to have fun with my family!”

“So you’ve been seeing her again. When was the last time you saw her??”

“In court, like I told the cops. Sorry I’ve been such a terrible husband and dad, I guess.”

Fuck, I really just wanted to hang out with my family! Or maybe I just didn’t want to be alone. Idk. Nothing feels right. 

I went to my home office and poured a glass of my best tequila. Then another. Then another. Then just half of one more. I was fully capable of walking correctly and everything! I wasn’t watching the time, though, so the kids and my wife were already in bed. I got into bed and cuddled her as the big spoon, but when I was about to fall asleep, I got a phone call.

It was from a blocked number. Part of me was certain it was Kyra, but I’ve changed my number since I last spoke with her. My wife made me after she called me begging for a ride for her stupid cat or dog or whatever. She was right! I mean yeah, I know you don’t have parents to call, but whose fault is that?! I need to work on my marriage! It’s not my fault you’ve burned every bridge you came across! 

“Have you checked the children?”

It was very clearly her voice, but it sounded almost like she was trying to make it sound like it wasn’t herself. She probably dislocated both sides of her jaw for this! I’ve never heard her speak that way before, something about how if you have a joint condition it’s bad to let it happen, idk. Still, my heart sank. She wouldn’t! Right?

Right?

Right??

I ran upstairs and they were asleep. I can’t believe I fell for such a cheap trick, but those are my children and I’m an excellent father! I would never take any risks. Still, I was afraid my wife would yell at me when I get back to the bedroom. I considered sleeping on the pull-out my wife sleeps on when she’s mad at me, but decided that I was just being a good dad and checking on the kids so I shouldn’t be afraid to face her.

The second I walked into the room, she shot up at a perfect right angle, like the posture you see in diagrams. I braced myself for the verbal lashing, but when I finally dared to unclench my eyes, she was rolling her head around like you would to stretch your neck. She’s ~~a secretary~~ an office assistant. That makes sense overall but after 2 full neck circles, it was still clicking- no, *snapping*- and just got louder. It was loud enough I was starting to wonder if she’d snapped her own neck but then she threw herself back onto the bed. She’d never been someone who sleepwalks or whatever, but at this point I ran up to her and touched her shoulder.

“Jared, what did you do to Kyra?” She asked softly, barely louder than a whisper.

“You’re asleep. I didn’t do anything to Kyra.”

Despite being asleep on her left side, my wife jerked her head almost half way around and insisted:

“What did you do to Kyra?” Only this time, I’d swear was in Kyra’s voice, I’m absolutely certain! I’d bet my life on it! Still, the laugh was definitely my wife’s.

I slept on the pull out.

***

The next morning I tried to be normal for my family, but something was very wrong. I stopped for coffee and some fucking beer that was actually cold on the way to the office, but I felt like everyone was staring at me. They weren’t glaring or smiling, they seemed to be normal people doing normal things if you looked at them, but they weren’t. I could only see if they didn’t know I could, but they were staring at me. Everyone was staring at me. Not normal judgemental staring, either. They were standing with their whole body facing me and staring at me, expressionless. They were barely a step above Amish dolls, they just… were looking. All of them. But the cashiers wouldn’t look at me when I was trying to pay, just stare when I saw them out of the corner of my eye. I come here every day and only ever buy alcohol if I forget to refrigerate mine! Why would they they judge?? I’m not drinking like it’s 2022!

I know I should never go back to this shop again, but today I’m really glad it was on the way to the office because I **NEED** to know what Kyra is saying about me and didn’t want a citation for opening my beer in the car outside of the shop. It was worth finding another shop for this, because I need answers NOW. 

The second I got back on my land, I googled our city’s crime reports, then murders near me, then gave up and googled Kyra’s name. The only break I took was to put my warm drinks into my fridge, but then I was right back to my Google. I was so relieved to see I had a comment on my last post about someone else maybe also being framed by Kyra?? I tried to message him a ton and commented on his post but he said I’m crazy and I think he blocked me. I’m not crazy. I can’t be! Lights are dimmer if I want them bright or brighter when I want them to be dim. Everything tastes wrong even though it isn’t spoiled. And the staring?? Something is wrong! That man told me I was crazy! I feel crazy! I went to put more canned margaritas in my fridge but I guess I’m out. 

I really need to go get supplies for work, but I should go home. I can’t go back to that shop. I don’t want to go anywhere but home. The cold beer in the fridge is just a bonus but honestly, I just want to see my children. As soon as I’d gotten to the area where I had service again, I got a text from my wife asking me to grab milk for dinner. Fuck! I really wish I could pretend I didn’t see it, but I know she knows I did. We set up a lot of different “I trust you, but let’s try”’s after Kyra. She knows where I am, she knows I’ve seen it, and she knows my phone isn’t dead. I have to get the milk. 

I decided to stop at Kroger since it was on the way, but I wish I didn’t. It was just like this morning… everyone was just staring, but never if I looked directly at them. I felt like I couldn’t breathe. This is a much bigger store with so many more people and so much more space. I felt like I was on display. I know I was afraid my wife would be mad, but this is a different kind of fear. You know that feeling where it’s like your heart fell into your ass and is just stuck there? This felt like that but also itchy, like every hair on my body was standing on end. I wanted to leave without the milk but if I did my wife would be furious. She knows I stopped. I just grabbed whatever milk and went to the register. 

I couldn’t help but be distracted by the cashier ringing me up. She was a stunner, at least a 9 out of 10. She had long, slightly curly hair that went about to the end of her rib cage. She was thin enough I could see her ribs through her tight Kroger shirt, but not thin enough to be flat chested. She was actually very blessed in that department, and so was I, considering she wasn’t wearing a bra. It was hard not to think about gently running my thumb across her hard nipples before sucking them while I carefully slip my hand into her jeans. She wanted to tell me about some survey so she leaned forward to circle it on the receipt, but when she got closer to me I could tell something was very wrong. Her breath was foul. It reminded me of the sweet, sinus burning smell of rotting meat. 

She exhaled really hard before saying, “so just go to this site putting in my name, Kyra.”

“What was your name? Sorry?”

Her voice dropped several decibels as she dropped the customer service smile and widened her eyes to repeat, “my name is Kyra. Does that bother you, Jared?”

I just told her to have a good day and hurried out to my car, but I realised I left the milk and had to go back in for it. I handed them my receipt, they handed me the milk, and I left in a hurry. I glanced at the receipt before sliding it into my pocket and dropped my keys and milk.

1q8o0oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/thefinals/comments/1q8o0oh/hot_take_playing_casually_still_means_you_should/,"Hot take: playing ""casually"" still means you should play the objective / as a team","A few days ago, I was playing point break, and had someone spend the entire game emoting with a cup of coffee. When some of us noticed and called him out in chat, he just said ""why report me? It's a casual mode and not against TOS."" Someone also recently posted about facing toxicity in a casual mode and asked why you can't just play casually in casual game modes. I see this sentiment and discussion all the time in a ton of different gaming circles. I myself *only* play casually--I played a lot in S1 and S2, and almost exclusively played Bank It (R.I.P.). Came back for S9 and mostly play point break and some Cashout. So I am by no means a ranked grinder or anything like that.

But let's be clear about something. 

On the one hand, absolutely don't be toxic or abuse people in chat. Ever. Full stop. People have different levels of skill, and anybody who tries to insult someone or make them feel bad about that is an idiot. Especially with all the recent SBMM complaints, if you're a veteran player and get some newbies, instead of calling them bad and being a toxic little shit, give callouts and help them improve. Otherwise just shut the fuck up. 

On the other hand, I do think we should be clear about something else. The ""bro it's a casual mode"" mindset doesn't give people, like the guy I mentioned at the beginning, the right to totally just fuck around in my honest opinion. Unless you're playing team deathmatch or an LTM, which is truly just kill chasing, then you're playing a team-based objective game. I think it's reasonable, in that situation, to expect your teammates to at least make an effort to play or contribute to the objective of the mode in question. 

So, if some light spends an entire game just swinging around because he wants to feel like spiderman, it is fair to be annoyed at them. If I'm playing cashout, and my two teammates are defending a vault, and I just keep going to 1v3 teams on the other side of the map, yes, that's annoying. If, in point break attack, someone keeps rushing into 7 people without any regard to the objective, dies, then just keeps respawning without ever waiting to be revived . . . yeah it gets a bit annoying, because at same point, being overly casual ruins the experience for everyone else. And in that case, I don't think it's toxic for someone to type in chat ""don't coin"" or ""group up on X"" and to write that off as just someone taking the game ""too seriously.""

TL;DR - of course you can play casually in a casual mode. Nobody should expect or demand that you use a particular weapon, or gadget, or class, or make crazy clutch plays or have good aim. Nobody should expect to win every game. And nobody should get on your case even if you miss all your shots, don't make it to the objective in time, or are otherwise just figuring stuff out. And if you're a veteran and get newer players, help them out. But we should all at least be making an attempt at both playing and contributing to the objective of the game mode we're in (or learning what it is) as well as playing the role we've chosen.

1q8o0bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaseSapphire/comments/1q8o0bi/edit_review_auckland_and_sydney/,EDIT review ~ Auckland and Sydney,"I know that The Edit program gets a lot of grief and criticism on this sub, but I wanted to share my very positive experience.  We are not 5-star hotel people generally, our target price range for a room is $150-200 ish.   

In October, booked The Cordis Hotel Auckland for two nights, Dec 30 & New Years Eve.    Used the 2025 $250 credit, and the balance was booked on points, for 13,000ish points (total) covering two nights.     King view room was fine.    $100 prop credit was used in the bar, for arrival beverage and then dinner.    Breakfast was a top notch buffet.      Welcome amenity was a chocolate cakey dessert thing in the room on arrival.   A great 2-night stay at a nice hotel, for 13000 points total

Also in October, I needed two nights in Sydney for early Jan, and decided to use points ( I have a LOT).   My 2025 Edit $250 was already used for Auckland.    I was targeting 10,000 to 15,000 points per night.      The top of the portal search posts Edit properties on top of course.      The Four Seasons Sydney , at 2x boost, was 14,350 points per night.       There was nothing available in the sub-15,000 points range that was even remotely close to this quality, so I grabbed it.     Welcome amenity was a nice bottle of red wine ( they had option for non alcoholic).   Used the $100 credit in two in-house bars for happy hour.    Breakfast was a decadent buffet.    

Last night, we had a single “open” night in Sydney ( no advance hotel booked).     Searched for a place on the portal for points-only…. Again, the Edit ones with 2x points boost were best value.    Stayed at the Kimpton Margot Sydney.  14125 points.     Although only one night, Got the $100 prop  credit ( used for Laundry and poolside lunch).    Breakfast ( included) was not a buffet, order any main item from breakfast menu, plus two sides, and any coffee plus OJ.   No welcome amenity.      But… our favorite hotel of the three.     Slight upgrade from std King to premium king ( sitting area w sofa etc).    Perfect location.     Free happy hour 5-6 pm ( we used it).  Free bike rental includes helmets and locks ( we used it).   Hip atmosphere.         Of note, I suppose I should have investigated using the IHG benefit, but I was in a hurry and have not figured out the booking sequence to use that credit, and we planning on using it on a trip later this year when I dig deeper.   

I presume that a pro analysis might find holes in my reasoning, but in my mind:    I used about 57,000 points, zero cash…. And received (5) premium hotel nights, $300 in property credit that was well-used and would have been cash expenses otherwise, plus six breakfasts ( at $20-40 each value?).

1q8ny0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q8ny0r/sharing_my_story_so_someone_talks_me_out_of/,Sharing my story so someone talks me out of reaching out to him.,"Both in our early 30s. He pursued me. Hard. He would call me constantly in the beginning and being lovey dovey to the point even I thought it was a too much but I caved in because we wanted the same thing, we had such an insane connection that it seemed so obvious that we belonged together. Talked about living together even, multiple times. Never felt like this before. Only downside is that we lived in two different states but he came my city twice a month for work so the arrangement didn’t seem bad to me. 

Then shortly after the first month mark, over the phone (we would have almost daily calls that lasted for HOURS) I said “hey I really like you” and wondering if we’re still aligned on where things were heading to, but this triggered a panic in him, saying that yes we of course we’re building towards a relationship but after that call he pulled back for a couple of weeks. He came back to my surprise (I really thought things were over since I wasn’t THAT emotionally invested yet after one month). We restarted and even planned two trips together shortly after but he never fully “came back” to that first version I experienced. There was something missing but there we’re still moments that felt wonderful every now and then. I brought it up after a while and he said he needed time to “build up to that again”. Constantly blaming that his two previous relationships started really strong and then burned after the 4th month mark when he “finally decided to commit but got discarded almost right away”. He said something along the lines that being hot/cold is better than just riding up high all the time. 

So fast forward to our 4th month mark, things were “good” in the sense that he was somewhat consistent (if not sometimes dismissive) but that “something” was still missing from him. Met each other’s friends, went to work events together (in which he said it was ok to intruduce him as his bf to my corworkers but he wasn’t really my boyfriend, “still working towards it”). We both acknowledged we were in a relationship but “the title” was too much pressure for him. 

On our second trip 2nd trip we had an incident with me trying to hold his hand in public and he janked his hand away from me “chill, chill, this is too much”. I kept it cool but I just started crying in the hotel, the conversation led to him saying he was scared I had strong feelings about him but we made up, had sex, had a wonderful last day of the trip. 

When we came back to our respective cities he almost immediately disappeared saying he was too busy but still here for me. I brought up the terrifying concept of the titles once again. It became a full blown argument that we never came back from, once again disappeared for a week and when we tried talking again it was so half assed I had to end things right there for my own sanity. He said he had too much going on to try right now, ended in a hopeful “maybe in the future” note. This was 2 months ago. 

Since then we have texted here and there. Met for coffee when he was in town and the conversation was a very pleasant catch up, nothing about our relationship but I asked if he has brought a jacket of mine he has with him. He seemed a little taken aback that I asked and he said he’d bring it next time. 

A week or so later, I found out through Spotify (sad i know lol) he’s dating someone else. The very next day this happened he texted me asking how my xmas was. I told him I was confused at him reaching out if he’s seeing someone else and he sent a short paragraph to just say “its just a playlist”. 

We haven’t talked ever since and I really thought that was the end of it but in January 1st he made an instagram dump of 2025 highlights. And there was, among videos and pictures of his best friend, a tagged video of me from our trip before the breakup. He never stopped liking my stories or posts but this last part is haunting me ever since that day.

I just want to reach out and tell him I can’t stop thinking about him. I keep wondering if I ruined something great by putting to much pressure on him? If I had been more patient maybe we could’ve rebuilt? I never told him that I love him but I do and it hurts so much to know he can just move on like that. I’m miserable. I don’t know what to do.

Throughout the relationship when I communicated my needs, she often saw it as an attack on her directly because she couldn’t give it to me. She also had no want to move out or leave at 25. She had a cerfew and strict religious parents. she wanted an indefinite relationship where I would never knew where she lived (she would get the bus to my house, or meet me a separate place ie a cafe in the biggest town near her house) never meet her parents even as a friend (she said they would hate me as I was obviously not religious) one where she slept round very infrequently (like once every 3-4 months) or spent long periods of time with her ie 4 hours a day, 2 times a week for coffee, before she had to go home for her curfew with me (the longest she spent with me was 4 days in row, on a holiday I planned and paid for) intimacy was rare and usually during the day because I barely saw her and was only expected to me initiated by me, I had no emotional comfort from her, even while crying and all efforts to communicate were immediately made to be me making myself the victim and ‘not considering her situation’. I was in this scarcity cycle where I was constantly up and down mentally, waiting for her to disappoint me - ‘I can’t be with you on Christmas, because my parents would assume i was spending it with someone special’ or her deciding that all she needed to contribute to the relationship was defying her parents, I was expected to provide everything from my flat as a place to go, to food, to plan and pay for dates, to the two holidays etc. 

While i understand now that she truly did not have the capacity to give me what I wanted and that her situation was harder, I was still in a relationship where I lost most of my self confidence and constantly felt like the best I was gonna get was what she could give me, which essentially was staying in the closet forever and indefinitely and never moving onto an adult relationship (when we were both adults In our mid 20’s who were already together for two years at that point). this was my first ever relationship, at 23, so I have no reference point for a healthy relationship. 

I feel almost no want to date or be with someone else, not because I miss her, but because i know associate being in a relationship as something miserable. I feel like I’ve lost my libido because I had lost my self esteem while with her and because she wanted me to lower it so she wouldn’t feel so guilty having lesbian sex because of her home situation. I feel like my standards have been lowered to her situation and i don’t want a repeat of that relationship, but i can’t imagine anything else. I feel like my needs and wants in a woman are what I was able to give her, but I’m not used to that at all and can’t even imagine it now. I genuinely can’t imagine a reciprocal relationship, so I don’t know what to look for in a relationship or while dating. ",3,1768001222.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False
1q8nv6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskForAnswers/comments/1q8nv6f/why_would_a_barista_do_this/,Why would a barista do this?,"First, I’m not someone who just thinks any girl that does something mildly different is attracted to me, I just think this is something entertaining and I’m curious as to what others think about this.

I’m a 20M and have been going to a coffee shop for about a month now. I do my schoolwork there, study etc and every time I go there, the same barista always tries to make her presence known near me from how it seems. When I order from a different barista, she acts like she’s moving things near the counter or tries to act like she’s stocking something. She’ll come right up to the desk after I order and am waiting for my drink and just fake doing things. This isn’t something in my head either, this is the truth lol. I can physically see her doing absolutely nothing but fidgeting when she’s at the counter and then all of a sudden walk away. I’ve always questioned it.

There’s been a few times where she’s taken my order and I usually create small talk just because I’m a talkative person and like to ask questions and every time she responds, she always asks me a follow up question trying to keep the conversation going. I don’t think much of it at all, until I checked my bank statements to find out every time I order from her, I’m getting a discount. I get the same drink every time and for some reason every time I order through her, it’s insanely cheaper.

There’s been other times where I’m sitting down, doing schoolwork & I can see her taking peeks at me through my peripheral vision…multiple times when I’m there and I’m the only person in the area.

I’d never make a move on her as in getting her number, but I do find her attractive and I do find all this interesting. She also seems like she’s the same age as me maybe a yr older so it makes me more interested. Does anyone else think this is different and what the reasoning might be or am I just crazy lol.

I drink coffee every day. I know a good way to limit microplastics exposure is to avoid having any hot water touching plastic. 

I have a Nespresso machine which uses capsules mostly made up of aluminium (though there’s a small plastic liner and the machine itself has plastic components), and I also have a basic drip coffee machine which is nearly entirely made up of cheap plastic . I’ve been debating which one is less bad, while also researching options.

Looking for any recs on neighborhoods, and how to find a solid rental. (I have scanned StreetEasy, fb marketplace)

Lived in SF before and have visited NYC 10+ times, so have some sense of the city life & what each neighborhoods vibe is like, but know moving there is its own beast in itself.

Wouldn’t mind living in the action & busyness of the city, and commuting up to Columbia. As we’re looking forward to walking around, and experiencing new things (restaurants, bars, coffee etc). We are pretty outdoorsy, but planning to embrace this city life for the short time we are there. Walkable to a waterfront area or park, and having a rooftop or porch would be a dream set up. Im also a huge sports fan, love watching baseball, football and basketball.

I believe the best commute would be living along the west side / greenwich/ meatpacking areas and taking the 1 train up?

Price range 4K-6k per month for a place  (I know we likely won’t be able to get all of these in one place)-

\-walkable to waterfront area or park

\-porch or rooftop area attached to place

\-accessible subway up to Columbia

\-in unit laundry

\-1 or 2 bedroom

It's old and as part of public housing has probably been full of roaches longer than I have been alive.  I keep my apartment very clean and put everything in safe containers.  I call to have my apartment sprayed any time I see roaches, but even when I don't see them, they are still there.  They come under doors, through vents, through electrical sockets. etc.  But I am disabled and on my own, so this is what I can afford.  

When I moved in, my elderly father gave me a Keurig coffee maker.   I only drink a cup of coffee once or twice a year but use it almost daily for hot water for quick oats and tea.  Today I was trying to make chamomile tea to calm down after something upsetting happened, and it dispensed hot water and a roach.  I opened the cup holder for the coffee pods, and I saw a dead roach.  I pulled out the removable pod holder, and there were two more in the mechanism that holds the pod holder.  

I cleaned the pod holder, and I have never seen any around the water reservoir.  Nothing else can be taken apart.  I cannot afford to replace it, so I can't just get rid of it out of disgust.

1q8nln7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SombreObserver/comments/1q8nln7/38_m4f_v3_marylandldr_usa_soaring_single/,38!? [M4F] (v3) Maryland/L.D.R USA | Soaring Single Sapiosexual seeks Shared Selfless Siring showing Scions.,"So... hey, can I just... skip the part where I try to sell you on me for a moment and just... be here for a minute.   

This is my third rendition on this sort of thing. Maybe this will be the charm? And I’m really getting to know... both myself, how I am in ways I could not know on my own, but also... others. Our struggle and our way. It’s a real melancholy kind of beauty. 

Each time I make these, I write a new poem. Cause... that’s just me, I guess. Last one wasn't a fan of such, and it seems... more important than I originally accepted... you should be. Since... you know what I am? I’m a cultivator. I shine on things and they grow. And now I need someone to have a little of that shine for me.

#*So then... that’s the TLDR of this?*   

I’m complexity embodied. A soul of nuanced layers, simultaneously intense and soft. Resilient yet vulnerable, I’ve navigated life's intricate landscape with (often) profound emotional intelligence. This depth which I hold transcends simple categorization. It is a living mosaic of experiences, hopes, and spirit, built over decades.  

Which means, I should tell you: I'm a lot. Not in a chaotic way, but, in a *depth* way. I feel things fully. I think about everything. I'll write you something at 2am because a thought wouldn't let me sleep and my heart, trust, hope... wanted you to have it. The genuine kindness. Not ""look how caring I am,"" just... warmth that radiates without announcement. I've learned that the right person won't find this exhausting. She'll meet it. Even like it.   

And yet I seek the kind of love that lives in among the subtle. Breakfast made quietly on a Sunday. Eyes meeting across the room for no reason except that we're glad. The comfortable silence of two people who don't need to fill the air to feel close.    

I want to find you reading on the couch at 9pm and wrap around you from behind, rest my chin on your head, and just stay there... swaying a little if there's music, maybe stealing a kiss on your neck just to feel you shiver.    

But I also want the big things. ***Kids*** (eventually). A family. Someone to build something real with... not just a relationship that ""works,"" but a life that means something. As mentioned, I've spent decades building myself. Now I want to build with someone.  

I’m hoping for in someone whom can be my life partner, a teammate, my greater other half... not just romance, but someone to eventually build a family with from the foundation up. Someone whose mind makes my heart race and at ease, in a good way!   

Currently... technically... I’m in a deeply friend-zoned, low-contact LDR (more on my thoughts in the LDR Section). But as it’s clearly not a seeked relationship anymore, I'm looking again. As deeply selfless as I am, turns out I want to see someone who *wants* to take care of me too, because being needed is its own kind of love.

***Health Note: If you have photosensitive epilepsy, this won't work as the games, films, and EDM/Nu-Disco shows I enjoy are filled with flashing lights!***

#Who Am I?

I'm a 6'X"" (over 183cm) “INFJ-A/infp”, who’s tall, bald, bearded free thinking gentleman with hints of ginger and sun-reddened skin. Introverted old soul, straight-edge, disciplined, virtuous... and probably a little crazy. Just, make sure I’m crazy for you, and you’re in! ;D
I'm protective without being possessive. You're your own person, an adult, and I respect that fully. My strength is old-fashioned but not relationable lone-wolf; it's quiet, restrained, gentle as an act of power. I'm devoted, patient, and unconditionally giving once the basics of trust are met. Not ""alpha male"" performance noise. Something older and deeper. 

 I'm told I have intense eye contact. As presence, not aggression. Some find it endearing, others unnerving. I've got a mild dad bump (not a spare tire), apparently a great ass (according to a gay man who asked me out), and I dress well within my means. My last LDR said I was cute. Maybe you'll agree.   

I’m also a deeply creative person. I process by making. Writing or art. It’s how I discover some of what I think. Most people consume; I create. I’d love to write poetry about you!    

######What I Offer:

- Unconditional love 
- Tenderness
- Shared intellect and curiosity 
- Protective strength without possessiveness
- Presence
- Devotion/loyalty once trust is met
- Honesty
- Acts-of-service love
- Intentionality
- Adaptability. Partners assess, partners adapt. I hold my end.
- Problem-solving over gossip 
- Depth over daily check-ins... though this we’ll play by ear depending on how we contact one another.
- Emotional consistency, once we can settle our hearts.
- Healthy self-care (parenting demands vitality)
 
######Interests:

 Games & Films that treat you like you're intelligent. That trust you to feel; Bungie Halos, Mass Effect trilogy, Cyberpunk 2077, Ghost in the Shell, Samurai Champloo, Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut. Quality over quantity. Craft over marketing. If you understand why these specific things matter beyond entertainment, we might vibe.    

Late-night rabbit holes & Wikipedia spirals. The smell of rain. Cooking for someone... (work in progress... no died last time!)... whom I love. Dancing badly in kitchens.     

I want bookshelves full of stories for future kids, teaching them how to think rather than what to think. I want to be present for 3am fevers, first words, and scraped knees.
 
######Pets: 
I'm fine with most pets, provided they aren't dumb as dirt, destroy the house, or sentient clouds that molt on everything. Prefer cats over dogs currently. 1-2 max unless we're farming.

#What You MUST Offer:   

1. *Want kids eventually*. You, eventually, **[gestures vaguely at everything]** want to be a mother. Non-negotiable. 
2. *Honesty*. Nothing kills my respect faster than lies. Don't say you want friendship then ghost. Don't pretend to like things you don't. Just tell me plain and we'll work it out like adults. Just trust me on this... I’ll know.
3. **Sapiosexual attraction**. You MUST have an obvious, unarrogant intellect that moves me. This doesn't mean credentials (though those are badass). It means curiosity that doesn't quit, humility before the unknown, and the ability to hold complexity without collapsing it into easy answers. Making the complex simple. Understanding what's unspoken. 
4. *Kindness and inhabited femininity*. Not ""tradwife"" performance, but elegance with substance. Self-aware grace, poise, tact. Grounded power that doesn't need to prove itself. Warmth and wit given freely. 
5. **You take care of your body**. Not just about attraction, though yes, the neurons are activated and attracted to physical markers of health and fertility among the curves, hips, and dips... of course they are, I'm a human male. But as long as you're healthy? It's about how you inhabit your own body. The rest is just... bonus points for fun. YOU ROCK IT GURL! It's something it seems the world just doesn't have enough respect for. A healthy body tends to support a healthy mind. 
6. *Age range: 28-42*. Biology has the final say when family-building is the goal. And while I technically don’t have that sort of clock, each passing year narrows the window for bedtime stories, not to mention the energy needed for toddlers and teething nights. Time weighs heavy. And I want to be there with you for each moment. 
7. **Comfortable with silence as intimacy**. Eye contact. Presence over constant communication. 

######Nice to Have:     

- I’m a tall man, so 5'7""+ (170 cm) would be welcomed.  This used to be a must, due to ergonomic/medical considerations at my height, but... my last person was 4'11” but had presented the “MUSTS” in spades.
- Music compatibility: progressive trance, synthwave, lo-fi, chillwave, Röyksopp, Armin van Buuren, Yoko Kanno. In no way a full list. We don't need identical playlists, just similar ways of ***feeling*** sound.

####THE DREAM

It's a Tuesday morning, just another day among our little world. Sunlight streams through the curtains all golden and warm. I kiss your cheek as you're waking up, still soft and sleepy and lovely. Maybe I've made breakfast, no fanfare, just because. You or I, we head to work with a smile that lingers. Maybe a ""Have a nice day, dear"", or maybe not... all that lingers being said. 
Evening comes... you're deep in your reading, while I'm working on some 3D art project, lounge/chill music playing low. Not talking, just... being. The kind of comfortable silence that feels like the sweetest conversation, where our presence is all the company needed. We each just... our hobbies, our creations. Every so often you share something funny you read, or I show you what I'm creating, or one of us just looks up and catches the other's eye. Smiles for absolutely no reason except that we're happy. 
Sometimes I'll just... appear behind you. Wrap my big arms around your waist, around you, chin resting on your head, swaying about to whatever music is playing. Maybe I sneak a kiss on your neck... make that chill run down your spine. Or you'll wander over and lean against me, ""whatcha doing?"" even through you can clearly see what I'm doing. And I'll kiss the top of your head or lean into you and murmur ""you know"" with a smile in my voice.    

Because you do know. That's the magic of it.    

We make dinner together, when we can, dancing around each other in the kitchen like we've choreographed it a thousand times. Or... maybe we just forget dinner and casually dance the night away. In it all we just... behold together without needing to fill the space. No checkboxes. No goalposts. No games.     

Our home is full of that quiet, warm kind of love; the kind that doesn't need constant words because it's everywhere. It's soaked into your skin, and breathed in the air, like music heard though the soul. We don't need constant validation because we know without knowing. Where ""I love you"" is in breakfast, remembering how you take your coffee. In me remembering you hate doing dishes so I do them without asking. In you leaving little notes tucked in places you know I'll find them. In the way we move around each other like a dance we've been practicing our whole lives without knowing. By seeing you happy, compounded by my own.     

""I love you"" lives in every small gesture, every remembered preference, every moment of showing up. In the good and the hard... I want to be the one sitting with you in it. Not fixing, maybe. Just there, for you. I want to watch you chase what lights you up, and follow you in your joy. Where the mundane becomes sacred because we're for each other, doing it together is no longer simply a literal thing only. It's the mind that understands, the heart made warm, and every simple thing suddenly greater in complexity than any word can behold.

####POETRY!
She'd almost stopped. The search had grown so long.   
But then... something stirring, like a half-remembered song.   
Something caught her purring, a whisper on the soul.    
A pull toward somewhere she could finally go.    
 
She reached out. He reached back.     
They began to speak, and in nothing lacked,    
Not surface talk, but true and unafraid.    
Not over her, but with her. Something made.   

She opened more. Shared the wounds that made her sore.    
He stayed. Man at the door, to hold the day's score.    
*Gasp* ...oh. And then warmth began to show.    
Through choice and trouble, she began to know.     
 
Trust grew its roots. She let him closer still,    
Than anyone had ever been before, or will.    
And when at last she shed her guarded skin,    
He met her there and love became the win.       

Time weaves and breathes our tale. Those months and years?    
A day's scale...      
 
The table's set. Small arms wrap round her knee.    
A voice calls out in question; Mommy?    
This is the life she'd almost ceased to see...    
A Partner? And Friend? This man to be,    
Her family by her side, no more a plea.    

She's home.

####FYI: Long Distance Relationship (LDR) Contact.
I don’t know if I’m compatible with this form of dating, but then again, once is a lousy sample size. What I can say is, I am... more than I even knew, a deeply, DEEPLY passionate man. When that intensity has no local ground, our distance can throw the balance of the relationship off. And that doesn’t even account for how the difference in our local environment; our home, our upbringing, our life... our timezone! ...shapes the dynamic. If what I have here resonates, and you want to contact me, know that, should such be matched, that I put my whole heart in the effort to get to know you. And that needs to be in some way recognized. Which means too, my introversion pulls back in this method, so, you need to be aware of that possible duality between who you meet on online and in person. I mean, online... what choice do I have? My presence is the chat!

I. DO. NOT. GHOST. And I'm not here to perpetuate the cycles of hurt that arise among these horrible modern dating norms. If I think we're not going to work out, I WILL tell you. There is no room for guessing here. And again, please do the same for me.
 
Otherwise, yeah... I have no idea what I’m doing. And if we really match, provided we can make it work, I’ll gladly move where-ever to be with ya, in-time, should such be necessary.

###Contact: If You Want to Reach Out

If you've made it here, you've done something rare: you read. That tells me about your patience, your willingness to sit with complexity. 

Introduce yourself. Tell me who you are and why you think we might work. Not what you want to know about me -you've got all this and more- but what you are about? Tell me about you. Start with: ""I'm here after reading your long "" V3 Sapiosexual"" post linked from r/*, and [your authentic reaction]..."" Make it yours. Make it you. Tell me who you are. What you're building. What lights you up. What kind of love you're hoping to find. <3   

And when you write... don't try to impress me. Be honest about what you don't know. Ask me something real. And because I have to say it, apparently, curiosity is more attractive than certainty.    

Just... be present. Be curious. Admit the limits. ;D    

You got this.    

***Critical:*** Do not just copy and paste AI. I'm here to meet YOU. If your message sounds like ChatGPT, I won't respond. Lead with authenticity. Your account must be 30+ days old or you will not be able to PM me.    

**One more thing:** Reddit is my only social media. I know that's a ""Red Flag"" for some, but I'm old enough to have seen the enshittification long coming and avoided it. I called it in High School; ""And we won't even feel the flames until it's long too late."" I won't immediately jump to other platforms, as we'll need to build trust first, establish this is real. When comfortable, we'll discuss my preferred secure option for deeper connection. But that comes after, not before.   
 
Not because I fear what's outside, but because I know what I'm protecting. And... maybe I'm getting a little too real writing this, but after decades building myself... built for protection and presence. Built in reserve and virtues, in waiting. I who've silently breathed through each profoundly lonely breath, while being centered in my paradoxically content sovereignty. My dear, when I finally find you, oh... when I finally know you... it is of my dreams that every touch will be deliberate, every moment sacred. Not because I'm trying to be romantic (hopefully, I won't have to ""try""), but because I've waited so long that I can't help but treat it like the miracle it is. I've missed you for so long, and I still don't yet even know who you are. The warmth I've held so long has been waiting. Not for just anyone. 

Perhaps for you.

Have been trying to get help for my boyfriend. He has been having loose stools for years now, has had lots of blood work done, stool tests, looking more towards maybe just IBS-D? Though his iron seems to be declining over the years as well as his iron saturation. Is malnutrition common with this even if he is not eating a low FODMAP diet? Or could this be something else? He's had hair loss for the past year, hot flashes etc. his thyroid levels are fine. He has possible Alpha Thalassemia minor and Gilbert's Syndrome due to elevated bilirubin levels for years and other blood work. Haven't had geteric testing done yet. It also seems like when he eats a healthy diet during the week (whole grains, broccoli, greens, etc) he has loose stools the next day. He has coffee every morning and this prompts a bowel movement of course but always starts out solid and goes to soft to shreds. When he gets junk food on the weekend it goes back to normal, unless he's drinking alcohol.

Just trying to figure it all out. He has an endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled but not until March.

His calprotectin was also normal and bloodwork celiac was normal as well as any bowel diseases besides anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody which was slightly elevated. C-reactive protein normal.

He eats a yogurt every day as well for probiotics. 

We are starting to try a low FODMAP diet for a couple weeks to see if it helps his bowel movements. He usually only has minimal pain too. He also takes bulking pill supplements once a day to help but it only helps some.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2,1768000245.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

What we’re looking for:

\- Beautiful, clear-water beaches (the best ones you can recommend in PR)

\- walking around towns and exploring 

\- Local farms, coffee haciendas, or cultural experiences

\-Great food (local spots, not tourist traps)

\- no nightclubs or partying, we don’t drink 

\-We’ve rented a car, so we’re open to driving

Important note:

Day 1 needs to be very relaxed (easy beach, minimal driving, recovery from travel) as we’ll be traveling in the day after the wedding (it’s a short flight only 4 hours but we still want the first day to just be a beach day!) 

We’re happy to move around the island if it makes sense (San Juan / west coast / mountains, etc.), but also open to fewer bases if that’s better.

If you had 8!days and wanted a mix of:

	•	relaxation

	•	crystal-clear beaches

	•	authentic local experiences

	•	scenic drives

…how would you plan it?

Specific beach names, towns, and food recommendations are very appreciated 🙏

Snack - my oats with oat milk, a digestive and two oat crunch biscuits 11/10

Another not so great day - but - better than yesterday energy wise. I am really mentally drained today. Dad is being a prick as per usual. I took myself out today and removed myself from the environment and had such a nice day, but also aware how much my ED still controls me. But it was so nice to get away from the negativity and the constant torment of your doing so well, actually no you aren't and then the abuse from dad but also then the random, rare spurts of positivity. I also then went and got my toe nails done with my sister which was SO LOVELY. I love my sister so much! 

I then came home and dad started talking so much crap this evening, trying to wind me up - arsehole. I accidentally spilt a little bit of my cup of tea this evening and boom! I am ‘A shit person’ ‘I need to move out asap’, because I don’t do anything around the house and I ‘treat him like shit’. Also that I am 22 and need to grow tf up and I am a waste of space. Honestly just the usual. The only benefit of this was it has really shown me I cannot afford to slip and have him take control again I.e. come to my appointments or stop me working etc. 

I was chatting with my granny earlier about him today and we agree he definitely is struggling now he feels he loosing control over me (not coming to MY appointments, me working, me seeing friends, me buying myself nice things, me talking about potentially moving out). Which I know are all good things because he isn't a positive influence on my life. The only issue is neither is my brain in my current state. So now I am like fuck - I need some control and guidance, but dad isn't the answer and neither am I doing it solo because I can too easily slide and take my foot off the pedal. And well I have learnt neither is my team, telling me I can take a break. The only real support I have is on here, not to be dramatic or needy but it has saved me in so many ways, even being able to come on here and vent is bliss. I feel safe. I have my granny and sister too I guess but likewise they have very separate lives and only really see what I or dad tell them, and for maybe 30 minutes a day on a phone call mostly. 

Energy wasn’t great today, but better than yesterday and I’ve been able to make a solid plan for the next 5 days! Full energy - I can do this! Work will definitely help, away from dad, with positive people and also with a routine. I will be locked in. Ooo I also treated myself to some yummy food for my plan - my new tonys, Nando’s peri peri jam, smoked salmon, pancakes! Hope you all are well, happy Friday, hope you also all have a lovely weekend. I am going to make this one a great one! ",10,1768000098.0,recoveryplates,3,0.92,False

27 years old male here. I got a cerec crown last July, after getting a decay under my previous filling. The tooth's toot canal was treated a few years ago. Already in November I notice the line between the tooth and the crown darkening on the inner side, despite me brushing my teeth twice per day with an electic toothbrush and flossing daily.

I don't smoke or drink coffee, but I do eat curry or soy sauce containing food a lot.

Is this a sign of recurring decay or just a stain? Is this a sign that the crown must be redone?

I'm pretty anxious about it, please let me know if this is a sign to get my tooth examinatiin ahead of time!

for a bit of context, i'm a 20 y/o woman who has been diagnosed with pcos for about 2 years now, but the symptoms go way back. 

in the past year or two i have been gaining weight uncontrollably for the first time (fast metabolism all my life, went from around 50-55 kg to around 77 at 165 cm), which led to me getting tested for insulin resistance.

my HOMA-IR was around 5.2 in may with normal to low blood sugar + high testosterone and i've been taking 1500 mg of metformin since november, paired with birth control (took it from 15 to 17, then started again in 2024). it has helped me tremendously with my digestive issues, though not much help in other departments such as my horrible insomnia and fatigue. 

in late december, i started eating breakfast for the first time in my life and dropped 3 kg in a week, but since then i've been slipping because of the holidays and being on vacation. the weight loss still remained however, as i am still 74 kg. 

i was excited to travel back home and get back on track, however ever since then i've been getting pretty bad hot flashes and nausea to the point i can barely eat and everything disgusts me. it's horribly cold in europe right now yet i'm sitting here in shorts with my window open, but sometimes i get chilly in a way that feels feverish. on top of all of this, my sleep has somehow gotten even worse, i'm half awake while dreaming and can only sleep a maximum of 3-4 hrs at a time.

i tested my blood sugar and it's normal (130 after drinking a very sugary coffee drink, oops; my fasting levels are around 80) + there is 0% chance of me being pregnant.

should i be concerned regarding my hormones or am i just paranoid and probably caught some virus? i apologize if the flair is incorrect or this is a stupid post but i'm genuinely scared as i start uni exam season on monday (law) so now is NOT the time for this 😭😭",1,1767999846.0,PCOS,2,1.0,False

Obviously, a dream is only a reality when you put in the grit and hard work. I’m not afraid of hard work. 

However, I am afraid of it not working or being a flop and losing savings. Or not being a sustainable way to make a living. Also, the cost of running a business in Ireland. 

I loveeeee baking, making coffees, breakfast pastries. I love dogs and nature. Illness has made me so grateful for small things. I have visions of my own cafe with food made with love, dog friendly and selling products from local businesses. 

I just don’t even know how people start this. Or is it ridiculous to try do it? I saw a popular cafe in Dublin close a while back because of costs.
