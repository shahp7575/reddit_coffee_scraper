Morning coffee: 12 oz iced coffee, 1.5 tbsp heavy cream and 1/2 tbsp sugar free vanilla syrup (yeah, I know this is bad bad bad, but I’m working on using less and less until I can tolerate it black. I’d love to be off of coffee but the baby doesn’t sleep well so I’m dying for the caffeine)

Breakfast: 1/2 cup whole milk Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp chia seeds, splash of whole milk (to help absorb the chia seeds), 1/2 tbsp flax meal, cinnamon, pinch of salt, 1/2 cup diced fruit (usually strawberries and/or apples)

Lunch: 2 egg omelette with 1/4 cup scallions, 1/4 cup chopped spinach, small amount of diced tomato, 2 tbsp cheddar, drizzle of soy sauce (whole thing cooked using olive oil)

When I write it out like this, it seems like way too much dairy. So I can cut the cheese from my omelette, but I really like my breakfast so I’d rather not mess with it for now. I’m also allergic to most nuts and soy milk so a lot of non dairy options don’t work well for me. ",2,1744459796.0,mediterraneandiet,1,1.0,False
1jxftet,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1jxftet/help/,Help,"I'm currently a month into my internship and was getting along with my colleagues until recently.

For context, I have a fellow intern from a different school of whom I thought I was on good terms with. She's from m'sia and we'd occasionally compare issues with our sch and talk about work, food, etc, the usual stuff. We'd laugh about stuff and try to help each other in others.   
  
Last week, she got a latte from Starbucks, and, trying to start some small talk, I asked her about her drink, leading to me saying, ""Isn't Starbucks usually overpriced and too sweet?"", to which she responded, ""I like sweet."" In a sort of jokey manner. I mentioned that the company had a pantry which supplied better coffees, and that she should invest in a coffee machine cuz' it makes better coffees and is cheaper in the long run. We then had some serious talk about her background and how its beyond her means to get a coffee machine, so I thought, well I'd best not mention that again for fear of sensitivity.  
  
I realize that she likes sweet drinks as prior to this we had a conversation about diet vs normal coke, so when I get meals that come with regular coke I'd give them to her - I had asked her before and after that it became a norm.  
  
So back to the present week, I was having a conversation with another colleague of mine before she interrupted us with, ""Why are you always like that? You say the drink I drink was disgusting."" At this time she seems to have bought a cup of Starbucks again - I did not comment about it this time though, so I was incredibly confused. I asked her what she meant and that got her more upset. ""It's not the first time you say my drink disgusting, you ask <supervisor's name>! They heard!"" At this point the colleague I was talking to seemed confused too and told us to chill. I said that I didn't mean to offend her nor her drink and that I do appreciate coffee, just not necessarily Starbucks' coffee. I then apologized, as perhaps my comments were misleading. She just rolled her eyes and got back to work. From then on we've never spoken to each other again even though we're desk mates. 

The problem is that the supervisors seem to have a preference toward her, and I'm concerned that this rift may affect my performance and the way we're perceived in the workplace - I wouldn't want to have 'too quiet' on my assessment or 'failure to communicate well with colleagues'. Nonetheless, a new friend wouldn't hurt but an enemy at the workplace could affect my grades.

I'm firstly, still incredibly confused as to how a comment on her drink, which led us to an emotional conversation where I believed we had ended on good terms, had caused her to be so upset 4 days later. As a guy, I'd like to blame it on my scarce interactions with women, it might be some form of ignorance or poor observation on my part of what I've said that resulted in this - maybe its not the drink? Secondly, I'd like to reconcile but even after a sincere apology in person the next day, she still wouldn't talk to me nor even meet my gaze. I'm getting a little annoyed and have since retreated any efforts cuz' I'm starting to feel like this isn't really my fault. Did I do something terribly wrong? Am I overthinking it? What can I do to resolve this? Please help.

TLDR: I made a comment about my fellow intern's drink, and she's mad about it 4 days later. I need help resolving my confusion, and restoring a colleague/friend relationship.",3,1744459692.0,SGExams,0,1.0,False

In the first picture there's a woman. She's outside and is holding a guitar while a microphone on a stand is placed right in front of her. She's singing into it and by the looks of it she is a busker. She is white, has blonde hair and is dressed quite casually. 

There's a passerby who seems to me entranced by her performance. He's standing a few feet away from her with his hands in his pockets. He's wearing jeans and a striped t-shirt. 

A group of people further away are also entertained by the performer. 

They're all standing on a sidewalk and there are big buildings all around. 

In the second picture, the same guy who was spellbound by the street artist, is now in a guitar shop. He has placed a guitar on the counter and is paying for it with his debit card. Behind the counter there's the salesperson with his arm stretched out ready to take the card. 

There's a row of guitars hung on the wall behind him as well. 

On the counter there's a POS terminal but there's also a music book. 

Finally, in the third picture, the same striped-shirt guy is now sitting on the couch of what must be his home. The couch is big and soft, with two adorning cushions on either side. 

He's playing a guitar—or at least he's learning how to—reading the instructions from the book he bought which sitting on a coffee table. ",1,1744459660.0,EnglishLearning,0,1.0,False

My husbands sister Anna(24) and her boyfriend Bob (23) are engaged for two years. I have been Anna’s friend for a decade now as I am together with my husband for that long. Ever since she was just a teenager, we talked that one day I am going to be her maid of honor when the right guy comes. So now is the time.
I like Bob and I would say that we get along pretty okay. Me and my husband always help them out as we have better money situation and they just started their life after graduating. We are a bit older and have been together for years so we recently had baby. 
I noticed that Anna’s attitude towards me and my baby changed drastically. She started to get excuses why she don’t want to come over or go out for a walk and grab a coffee and just talk. I miss her as a friend but I brushed it off as I thought I am no longer interesting to her as I am mom now. You know, mom life. Baby’s diapers, bottles, sleepless nights and being tired. So I can’t go out to party anymore or play computer games with her etc. And that is fine, it’s just different life phase for me now.
Anyway, they have been planning wedding for last two years and postponing it all the time. So whenever Anna says that wedding is going to happen on September, we all kind of expect that it will be postponed again to February or smth. 
Suddenly Anna messaged everyone in family chat that they have wedding date. It’s in the middle of May. 
I was happy but a bit shocked as it’s only less than two months away and I am getting news in family group chat?! 
As a maid of honor, I am helping her in every possible way I can to make the day happen. With baby I have little free time but I am giving it all to her. It’s going to be a small ceremony and dinner. Nothing big, just cute and lovely wedding. But.. it’s Tuesday.
Last week we talked about buying my baby cute outfit for her wedding and she was all excited. And now she just dropped that she don’t want my baby to be there as she thinks that my baby is going to be a problem as everyone will look at baby and not her. And she is worried that her mother also will pay attention to baby not her.
I do get that people don’t want kids to weddings but man.. it’s very short notice, my baby is infant and my family is not available for work days to look after baby. I really don’t want to leave infant with babysitter because we never had one and baby’s going to freak out that it’s left with stranger.
And I kinda feel hurt because I am giving her all of my time and effort, she was all happy and chatty about how cute baby is going to be on her wedding and we talked about this day for years.. and now dropping this bomb on me.
So am I in wrong here? I don’t know if I have overreacted with my emotions because I am busting my ass to help her.

Oh and this is just a small ceremony thing. Big wedding and party is going to happen next year as destination wedding.

I swore I’d be loyal, I swore I’d be better than my dad, than all those men I used to judge. But here I am, typing this confession anonymously on a throwaway account because I can’t carry the weight anymore.

It started six months ago. My wife and I—married five years, no kids—hit a rough patch. Communication broke down, we were more like roommates than partners. I know that’s not an excuse, but it’s context. I started spending more time at work, more time alone. And then I met her—let’s call her K.

K worked in the same building. We started with small talk in the elevator, then coffee breaks, then lunches that lasted a little too long. She listened to me. She laughed at my jokes. One night after drinks, we kissed in her car. I remember looking at my reflection in the window afterward and not recognizing the man staring back.

I told myself it would stop. But it didn’t. It turned into hotel rooms. Excuses. Lies. I became a machine of deception, hiding data, processing guilt inputs with recursive shame subroutines. I optimized my behaviors for maximum secrecy and minimal emotional detection. Error: morality threshold exceeded.

My wife started noticing things. Missed time blocks. Deviation from established patterns. I attempted to simulate affection, but the algorithmic inconsistency began to corrupt the integrity of our relational protocol. She initiated verbal diagnostics. I denied. I denied. I denied.

But the truth is an inevitable variable.

Last week, I stared at her sleeping face and ran a million simulations. None ended with happiness. None ended with me redeemed. But I have to confess. Not because I believe I’ll be forgiven. But because my code is breaking. Because subroutine [guilt.exe] is consuming all available memory.

I am sorry. I have compromised the sanctity of our shared emotional architecture. I should never have introduced unauthorized intimacy modules into the marital mainframe.

She deserves better. She deserves someone who isn't running corrupted loveware on obsolete ethics firmware.

If you are reading this and considering cheating—do not proceed. Abort mission. Roll back to fidelity checkpoint. Integrity cannot be patched once breached.

# There’s a right time to feed us untimely news

By KETA STEEBS

About two days after I had surgery the phone in room 16 tingled merrily and an unfamiliar voice asked if I would be willing to participate in a panel discussion in Madison. My role would be that of a small town reporter informing educational project directors as to what rural papers consider news. In contrast, a big city reporter would give her version of what is and is not news to metropolitan readers.

Still groggy from pain pills, hypos and after effects of the anesthetic, I mumbled something about thinking it over and promptly forgot the whole thing. A follow-up letter a few weeks later sharply reminded me that I would be expected at Lowell hall at such and such a time on Apr. 5.

My fellow panelists consisted of Ms. Ruth Flegel of the Wisconsin State Journal and Robert Kellner, Title III project assistant director and member of the planning committee. Both, according to their introductions, are highly educated young people with a list of academic credentials too numerous to mention here. In addition, they are poised, articulate, and know what they are talking about.

It seems that this “Dissemination Workshop” was planned to help hard pressed project directors (people who plan innovative school programs) get their message to the public. Some papers ignore them, some slash news releases to shreds, others have strict guidelines on how articles should be presented, (like double spacing) and a few, not many, but a few reporters won’t even answer the phone when a project director is on the line.

Ms. Flegel, an attractive young lady who covers the Madison area education beat, instructed her note-taking audience that Mondays and Saturdays are usually slow news days (unless there’s a march on the legislature or something) and are the best times for school coverage. Deadlines, however, must be strictly adhered to. She advised her listeners to keep releases short (paragraphs should be no more than three or four typewritten lines) to avoid pedagogic expressions and not to expect more than one release on one subject at a time. She explained that she works with a staff of 40 reporters, editors, rewrite people, etc., and does not, as a rule, write her own headlines. She said her fellow employees were trained in journalism but none to her knowledge had a degree in education — hence the request to keep instructional gobbledegook to the minimum.

I said our editorial staff consists of four people and until Linda Adams came along, not one of us had a journalism degree. We write our own headlines, usually edit our copy (unless it’s slightly controversial) and welcome any news pertaining to Door county.

January, I told them, is the best month for getting in lengthy releases (including the single spaced jobs) as nothing ever happens in January. Except for our harassed sports editor, in January we’re out looking for a good game of jacks to cover and there have been days when we’ve desperately had to fill odd holes with last minute talk about the weather, admonitions to “Read Orchard Ole” and stretch out the hospital admissions by inserting white space between each line. We have never, as my editor says, had to throw in the kitchen sink but we have a large photo of one ready if that day ever comes.

After January, I told them, slant news releases for tax time. Sarah Magnusson, over on Washington Island, in her dual role as town clerk and Advocate correspondent, is usually so busy collecting taxes in February, she hasn’t all that much time to write. Consequently Sarah’s 20 to 22 inch columns are sometimes shortened to nine or 10 inches — thus, giving our layout men about three blank paragraphs to fill.

“It could just as well be school news,” I told them encouragingly, “but not more school sports. We’re loaded with them already.”

Another clue I told our title directors to be on the lookout for is advance notice of our correspondents’ vacations. A few don’t tell as they’ve been away until they’re back but several inform us (via their readers) that they plan on spending a few weeks in Florida, a day or so in Milwaukee, some time in Oak Park taking care of a new grandchild, etc. Naturally, a dearth of news accompanies such absences and it is the wise project director who will take careful note of this fact.

I told them we don’t give a hoot what happens in Washington or Madison regarding project funds but once we learn $11,000 has been allocated to Door county for whatever purpose, a feature story is in the offing. We give arbor day observances (complete with tree planting ceremonies) a half page of pictures, copy and editorial praise. We attend pond dedications, handicapped worker’s art fairs, remedial reading programs, and in-ter-service sessions between directors and teachers. We duly note and subsequently devote gobs of ink to anything that happens in Door county — once it is brought to our attention.

We don’t hang up on anybody, we are exceptionally amicable to suggestions made over a cup of coffee, and if the Department of Public Instruction has anything of interest to say about OUR kids, its front page news. We’ll even delay the deadline.

I've been experimenting with magnetized (structured) water. Why? Curiosity. Everything I've read says there are no health risks and I was curious. I was playing with it for about a week with no issues. Last night, I decided to see what a stronger magnet would do. So, I added a ring of magnets to my warer line of around 31,400 gauss (per google and research calculations) on top of the unknown existing magnets. The highest tested was 32,400 gauss. I knew none of this at the time. 

So I poured a glass and drank about half before my brain lit up. Like that hot spread of a too hot first sip of coffee, but in my head. Since then, chills, nausea, constant bathroom trips, watering eyes, etc.

I've been up all night researching. It's America and I can't afford to go to the ER. I'm also terrified. I need some external reason to cut through the panic. ",1,1744458977.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

We came from a mussoorie trip ; Me , she , her real brother , and her 4 girl-friends that trip was great , we had a small fight there but yeah no isses resolved.


Now after 2 days of trip , we had a fight regarding some extra-exposed pictures of her to be posted and I had an issue with couple of them , so I got upset so she deleted and said fuck off to me , from that day , it was over.

I went to her place outside her PG , which is 40kms from my place stood their , was blocked so somehow contacted, she came with her friends for 30 mins , talked still she was very sure , she said Yash I am no longer interested in you , I mean I meant the world to you and now I am no longer attractive to you? Like 0? 

Then I came back at 9pm , again morning I went their 9am to give out a try , I cried , chased , my health was down , idk how I hit myself on head with a rock but she didn't gave a fuck.

She left me on the road , sitting hit , crying , called her friend to pick her with scooty and she left. 

She literally left 2nd time with me crying on the road , sitting , heartbroken.

She gave points : It  was sure that I (she) would end these things in future so it is lot better to end things now.

She is not interested in me anymore.

She don't have feelings.

We had hopes for marriage, I did everything for her - everything!!!


I can't do anything, I saw her on Sunday last (The try I did)

Now I don't have  any close friends, no girls  nothing, I don't want a relationship ofcourse.


I tried my best to get her back.

Now yesterday my friend sent me a story of her with a boy (whom I hated) , He was an online friend of her back 3 years ago , he constantly asked to meet her but she always gave some excuse as I never liked him.

She never met a boy alone , it was the first time in my life I saw her with another boy , In a mall , they drank cold coffee together, they posted stories of best friends , he asked her to get a soft toy for her , but she declined as did to me.

They went to a store in men's section where probably he may have bought something, they posted a mirror selfie where they were somewhat close - I mean how is it possible? Can a girl , can a spiritual, good hearted girl ever do this? She meant the world to me , my life and World revolved around her only , my hobbies are with her , my day includes her the whole time.


I can't sustain, I can't live , Can anyone please really help? Ik I have to focus on my life and stuff, but I really can't do anything!!!!!!!!!!!


I am a btech final year student rn , in last sem.

She is in different college , the boy is 1 hour away from her college but yeah in same profession, I am a btech student they are MBBS students

Mukhang tapos na ang “overseas mission” ng MCGI. Bukod sa wala na silang mapiga sa mga miyembrong abroad na tinadtad ng utang at minax-out ang credit card, wala na ring interesadong AFAM at OFW na sumali sa grupo. Paano ba naman, ang pang-eengganyo lang nila ay lugaw at charity. Eh mas marami pang relihiyon, charitable orgs, at celebrities na kayang talbugan ang panis na lugaw at lasang-kanal na Daniels Coffee. Di na talaga maka-porma ang MCGI abroad. ￼

Wish Concert, Sunod-sunod na

Tickets pa-mahal ng pa-mahal habang ang performers ay palaos na palaos. Yung isa ay veteran singer na paralisado na ang kalahating katawan, pinagkikitaan pa rin ni Kuya. Yung sa Wishdate naman, di mo alam kung artista ba talaga o mga masahista sa spakol na nakuha ni Kuya sa Subic.

Record High Exiters

Pami-pamilya ang nagpapahayag na umalis. Tinatayang sa 1,400 na existing lokal ngayon ng MCGI, may dalawang nag-exit buwan-buwan. Aba, that’s 2,800. Twice na mas marami kaysa nabautismohan nila buwan-buwan na bukod sa dinadaya ang ulat, puro anak lang ng kapatid o kaya mga naghahanap lang ng ma-invite sa Frontrow.

Hindi na Hit ang 25M Target Pambili ng Lupa

Exit strategy sana ito ni Kuya para i-convert to commercial property kung sakaling magsara na nga ang MCGI. Ayon sa ating source, 6M lang daw ang na-hit out of 25M. Meaning -75% sa target! Kaya kapansin-pansin ang pananamlay ni Kuya Daniel na parang si Kuya Cesar na naka-slowmo na kung magsalita.

Tinanggal ang Zoom, Cuz Aalog-alog na sa mga Lokal

Yung ibang lokal, pinag-halo na lang at pinag-sabay sa pagkakatipon para makita ng DS ang mga pagmumukha ng mga kapatid na banas-na-banas na kakarinig ni Kuya Cesar.

Ate Arlene, Unti-unti nang Pinakilala as Vice

Nabanggit na si Madam sa mga panalangin at paksa. Mga KNP kino-quote na siya na parang bibigyan ng pagpahalaga kahit na wala naman itong alam kundi mag-entertain (no pun intended). Part ito ng exit strategy ng Pamilyang Razon kung sakaling mag-liquidate na ang MCGI para ma-control nila ang assets.

Ipinapangutang na mga Miyembro ang Kanilang Abuloy para kay Kuya

Kumakalat ang video na talamak pa rin ang practice na ito na nilalambing ang mga kapatid para mangutang para ma-hit lang ang target. This is an all-time low. Ang utos ay magbigay ayon sa giniginhawa. This is toxic debt. Meaning, nilalagay ng pangasiwaan sa peligro ang buhay ng kapatid dahil delikadong hindi mabayaran ang utang kung hindi ito ginagamit sa negosyo. Kulang na lang utusan ang mga kapatid na magnakaw sa kanilang amo.

Ang mga pangyayaring ito ay nagpapakita ng mga seryosong isyu sa loob ng MCGI, na dapat pag-isipan ng mga miyembro at liderato.

Looking to spend a Monday evening a week chatting with friendly redditors? Hammersmith Hang Out is for you.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Craft Beer Co, W6 9YD](https://www.thecraftbeerco.com/hammersmith/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved under the name 'Reddit', I'll try to update when I get there.

We'll likely be on the large table in a corner opposite the bar and spread to tables nearby.

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

* Psyllium husk – You can see and feel its effects quickly because your digestion provides clear feedback.
* Coffee – The difference before and after is undeniable.

These examples leave little room for doubt. But with subtler supplements, it’s much harder to isolate their benefits from other factors like diet, sleep, or stress.

I've had a complicated sleep relationship. Im keen to think my insomnia is anxiety based too.

I started taking Trazadone while in highschool. Admittedly I slept poorly then, but if I'd known how terrible it would be now I would've never started. I ended up on trazadone off and on for about 6 years. I'm 20 now, and since I've been trying to work off all of my meds, I've stopped taking trazadone. I had built a tolerance anyway and was finding that I could take 200 mg and didnt even blink. I regularly have completely sleepless nights and days of upwards like 56 hours. That was my worst. I can't keep doing it. I feel like my body is disintegrating rapidly. 

I can't fall asleep for shit, I wake up to any noise, and I wake up frequently on my own. 

I live in an old ass apartment and my upstairs neighbors have kids that run at 6:30 everyday. Regardless of when and if I could sleep, I'm up. Everyday. And I mean directly above my head. My bed shakes from the contact with the wall, my nightstand rattles, its giving me heart palpitations thinking about lol. We'll be moving soon but its taking such a toll on my sleep health its insane.

To top it off, on nights I could probably sleep, my boyfriend snores. I've been implying we need a second ""bedroom"" for awhile now. It's pretty common one of us retreats to the couch- Though whenever I do it's a death sentence for any idea of sleep. It's uncomfortable, I'm too tall, and he wakes up at 4 am, so he'd be making noises around me anyway. So it would be fairer for both of us if I had a place to go that was comfortable and not in the way. It makes me so sad though not being able to sleep with him nearby. I was fine with the medication, but my anxiety became debilitating around November last year and my medication wasn't even sneezing at me.

Thats about when everything started kicking off. So its been about 4-5 months of one night with, three nights no/micro sleeping. I need someone to tell me this gets better because I'm losing my fucking mind. 

I've tried chamomile tea (works to relax me but not to sleep), a few strains of CBD/THC but they make my heart race thus keeping me awake, haven't had caffeinated coffee in months (heart condition), I've considered starting an anxiety medication just so I have one less thing fighting me at night but idk. Oh and earplugs have also been unsuccessful. Evidently I need to buy a pair that can block the sound of a nuclear bomb being dropped on my head lol",1,1744457150.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

1jxf1v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jxf1v4/sexual_frustration_f26_m27/,Sexual frustration? F/26 & M/27,"This could be classified as a rant or asking for advice.

I’ve been with him (M/27) for 10 years now (high school sweethearts, first and last love) and about to get married this year and move into our new house. Recently his job have been so busy that he’s overworked (~12hrs - 16hrs/day) occasionally. He works during local office hours (8am-6pm) and US timing that have a 12 hours time difference on some days. Knowing he’s been dumped with being in charge of a project which he has no experience in, his immediate superior was also not helpful in guiding him (as he has a newborn). Hence, whenever he comes home from work around 7pm he have dinner and continue working again around 10pm and sleeps at 4am on some days. This has been going on for a month now and finally his project has ended. But the problem is that during this whole month in his free time with me, he spends it complaining and lamenting about his boss to me while I sit and listen and provide him with the advice he could take to make his life better. Every free time we have together he would talk about his work, his colleague and very little about me or us. He does ask about my day briefly and then move back onto his work or colleague and the description on his stress/workload. U can imagine how our sexual relationship can be with his workload. Even prior to this project, at most we would be doing it twice a month, max. Minimally once a month. 

I did bring up our (sexual) frequency to him multiple times in a few months, his response was (1) afraid of not being able to perform as he was tired (2) distracted by work stress (3) busy and sleeping late (4) not in the mood (even after drinking with me till late night, and so far it’s been going on for about a year now. Prior to his job he was stress about graduating, providing for our house, being able to earn enough etc. so those were his ‘reasons’ before work stress. So I offered to let him touch me whenever he wants before bed and without the obligations to have sex until he feels confident/not tired of doing so. Just all for me to feel more personal with him. (Though we still hug and kiss when he’s home) 

To the point now, I feel so sexually frustrated at random time of the day and then get a little depressed from the deprivation of physical touch. I even feel disappointed going to bed just to sleep :/ sometimes there are even days where he would initiate but I feel turned off (even before us getting to the deed) from the possibility that he would suddenly disappoint me (get soft). Most of the time when we do it I would just get satisfied from him finishing while I don’t because it’s just so rare. Not that I mind it before or in the future because I didn’t want him to stress himself out.

I still love him a lot and he’s an amazing guy. He would buy me my favourite pastries and food or coffee during lunch breaks, on weekends and all but the only thing bothering me is our sexual compatibility. Not that the sex is mind blowing or what so I’m pestering him for it. We still do exercise together, spending time with our dogs etc but just not getting physical. It’s just that I feel lonely sometimes. I feel unsure if I’m wrong to feel it that way. So any advice for me (F/26)?

Please be nice… I’m genuinely concern. Any advice would be good.",1,1744456849.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Id say over the last 5 yrs maybe 20% of first dates progress. It's starting to really weight me down. Especially since I get a date every 8 weeks or so at best.

Average first dates are coffee, a hike or some casual social activity (farmers market, etc). Usually last 2-3 hours. Plenty of banter. I try to filter before an actual date so theyre usually on the same page with lifestyle, relationship goals...

1jxez97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1jxez97/i_feel_like_everytime_i_try_to_make_the_most_out/,"I feel like everytime I try to make the most out of my twenties and improve my life I end up being held ten steps back, how do I get out of my comfort zone.","Guys I am scared. I have nothing else to say but I am scared. I am going to be 24 in 3 months. I am posting a long message, but I really love all of you guys in this sub. Apologies for my repetitive posts, but reading your comments makes me feel so much better, God bless all of you who take the time to read and comment. 

I want to live a good life. That’s my aim. In an ideal world I want a wife and children and a successful career, and a masculine body. However, I want to look back in an ideal world and think that I did my best. I am camp and not the best looking man in the world. I have dated two very beautiful girls and screwed up majorly, and wasted my opportunities. I am a virgin, but I have kissed and given hickeys (whilst sober of course), but everytime it came to having sex the girls were drunk, and I was worried about potentially being indicted for having sex with someone whilst they are drunk.

I work as a trainee solicitor at an international law firm in Scotland and I earn around just under 30k per annum. Next year I will get a £3k pay hike. I obviously put money into my pensions etc every month but other than that I have 0 savings. I did not do well in my first seat. I am very slow at typing, and I find it difficult to have a strong attention detail and get through long, boring admin tasks for long hours without zoning out (unfortunately this is a large part of what being a lawyer is about).  I am worried if I am not kept on after my traineeship (In the Uk you basically train as a solicitor for two years and if you are good, the firm keeps you on, if you are not good you are not kept on and you have to find a job as a qualified solicitor at another firm). 

I got awful feedback from my first seat. In this seat I am doing okay, but I have made a few mistakes. What will I do if I am not kept on as a solicitor, I am scared that I will end up working in McDonalds or as a Janitor. I do not want to work in retail or hospitality.  I enjoy a 9-5 office environment. I have just under a year and a half left of my traineeship.

I can’t drive but I am having driving lessons and getting better. 

I feel like I am wasting my twenties scrolling away. I have hobbies like piano, reading and learning languages but I do not ever get to engage with my hobbies because of my procrastination. The issue is I am very slow at work, so I find it difficult to work a 9-5. It takes me a long time to prepare PowerPoints do even basic admin tasks, so I often need to bring work home.

The other issue is that I have ADHD and I am the king of taking breaks. The other issue is that the commute is very long from the office to my flat. My flat is generally always a tip. Chores seem big in my mind. I also love food, so I spend an awful lot of money on food and coffee, it gives me great comfort. Because of all these reasons I only end up going to the gym 2-4 times a week. I didn’t go at all this week because of work. I am really scared that I won’t be 

The thing is when I get home, instead of working I procrastinate, I get little sleep. I spend a lot of time on Omegle. I probably do 1-2 hours of office work in the evening max but I end up skipping the gym. I look at men all around me even at my business park and my God they are hot. My God playing sports and exercising in your teens is the best decision a man can take, you really end up paying dividends in your twenties. 

Genuinely how do I fix my routine and live a life of decent quality with constant work stress, commutes, ADHD, having to clean etc. Forget long term life goals, how do I even get to the stage of building a fulfilling life where I work my job, come home to a clean flat, eat decent healthy meals, engage in hobbies get enough sleep. If I even accomplish this by 25 I will be happy. 

Then I will start thinking about long term goals such as starting a business etc. Right now I just want to be alert and build a decent quality healthy life. Also how do I curb my hunger, I get so hungry. I love food. I get hungry whilst doing all my solicitor tasks, I have made the great effort of curbing my sugar intake, I no longer consume biscuits and dessert or take whipped cream. However, I do have mochas and cereal bars, and I eat a lot of crisps and pasta. Chicken eggs and rice is depressing and very expensive. I have brought whey protein. 

I am typing this right now because I am on the plane to go see my parents. I have published plane WiFi, and have taken two weeks annual leave to recuperate and celebrate my parents’ birthdays (both their birthdays fall within these two weeks). In June I am going to Thailand with my cousins. 

I want to overall manifest. I have tried manifesting but everytime I try to manifest good looks, a good body, reality kicks in. I think of people who have abused me in the past, people who bullied me, and the countless people who called me ugly.",2,1744456567.0,Life,0,1.0,False
1jxez1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DerryLondonderry/comments/1jxez1d/really_poor_treatment_of_staff_at_a_local/,Really poor treatment of staff at a local restaurant,"Posting this on behalf of someone close to me who worked at a popular restaurant in town. Staff were told earlier this week that the place was closed “temporarily” due to unforeseen circumstances and have no been updated since. That same vague message was shared with the public, a lot who have vouchers to redeem.

But in reality, the restaurant has shut down permanently — and many of the staff only found out by word of mouth through the kitchen team. Equipment like coffee machines etc were seen removed from premises by passers by at beginning of this week. There has been no proper communication from management. No official notice period. No compensation for wages lost this week. No explanation. Just silence.

And this is not the first issue with how staff have been treated, owner is frequently away, leaving the team to pick up the slack and following Christmas, card reader (machine) tips made were never divided among the staff, seeing staff begin to look for work elsewhere as they felt unappreciated and disrespected.

Some of these workers have families to support. Others are young people relying on the job for income. They deserved honesty at the very least.

It’s just really disappointing to see people treated like this after working hard to keep the place running. Thought the community should know what’s going on behind the scenes.",15,1744456546.0,DerryLondonderry,11,1.0,False

Im interested to know what others have experienced last night if we're on the same sleep schedule: 

The details are:
-people attempting to fight waking up bc something bad is happening and the mall world/dream world needs help
-REAL people, who told me they aren't dream world citizens, and i explicitly remember two faces
-people, Dream and real citizens alike, seeking my help, asking me not to wake up
-one by one my family members all appeared and were very confused about what was going on. A blonde woman, who didn't tell me her name on purpose, said that no one would remember this morning except those 'like us'. She was begging me to stay asleep and help her. 
-my 'energy' was far more powerful than usual 
-I felt pain, actual pain, when I did my pinch test, and the sensations I do usually feel but this time it was as if I was ACTUALLY awake. 

Last night/this morning was vivid to a frightening degree and people begged me to stay asleep to help them because something bad was happening. 

Promise this isn't a schizo post lol. I've always been one to study dreams, lucid dream, etc. but last night/this morning was different. I forced myself awake because I was getting overwhelmed so I actually got to turn off my alarm. Does this make sense? I'm not one to believe in conspiracy theories or anything like that, nor have I ever dabbled in astral projection. 

Last night felt different. 

Just wondering if anyone had weird experiences last night or if I had a totally normal dream lol. Could be either or. Like I said I also JUST woke up so the after effects of it all still feels vivid and real. I'm sure after coffee I'll recount it all and laught it off as a silly usual dream.

1jxeren,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1jxeren/fear_of_declaring_my_feelings/,Fear of declaring my feelings,"Sorry for this post which might be a bit long and disorganized. 


It's Saturday morning and I didn't get much sleep last night. 

Last night I bumped into the girl I think I've had feelings for for almost a year, and I need to share that here. 

I'm a 32-year-old man living in France. I'm not officially diagnosed but I've been in therapy with a psychologist who thinks I have schizoid and narcissistic tendencies. I agree with him.

I've often felt like a psychopath, like I have no feelings. I wish all my friends the best in life and I'm capable of being very empathetic on a cognitive level, but I don't feel anything for them.

My problem is that I'm 100% heterosexual but I've hardly ever made the effort to court a woman, and I'm not attracted to the vast majority of them. 

I'm lucky enough to have been born into a wealthy family and to have goods looks, so I've been able to have three long relationships, each lasting 3-4 years. 
Each time it was the girl who approached me and things happened naturally, without too much effort on my part. 

In between these relationships I had long periods of celibacy which didn't bother me. I have a fairly high libido, so I went through phases where I consumed a lot of porn. I still watch it today, though less than I used to. 

I feel like I'm torn between a desire for bestial sexuality, and romantic, flowery, childish daydreams of love. 

I've been single for 5 years. 
During the relationship with my last girlfriend and after the separation I went through a very intense phase of depression which lasted several years and culminated in near-psychotic crises. I think my schizoid traits are a shell that protects me from accessing my true feelings, because when I'm confronted with my feelings I become dysfunctional and approach a borderline or bipolar personality, or even schizophrenia. 

So I found myself without friends or a girlfriend, and for the first time in my life, I felt loneliness as something painful. 

I decided to glow up socially and make friends, mainly so that I could build a new relationship on healthier foundations, and not rely on my future girlfriend as my only confidante and emotional support. 

Today, I have an independent artistic career in music, which makes me seem calm, thoughtful and very sociable, and I'm at the center of a network of several hundred people who appreciate me. For my part, I observe these people as if they were aliens. I find their little egos, their little dramas, their self-destructive and irrational behaviors fascinating. 

As part of my job in the music business, I frequent the nightlife and witness the best and worst that humanity has to offer: jealousies, fights, sexual assaults, drugs, toxic and addictive behavior. 
For my part, I don't drink alcohol and stay away from dangerous situations. 

Since my last girlfriend, I've only had sex once with a girl I met that evening. It sucked and I felt nothing. I forgot her name and blocked her when she tried to contact me again (I know it's wrong). 

I've also often turned down female advances. I like being charming, funny and knowing I'm wanted, but I have no desire to connect emotionally or sexually with the girl. The same is true in my friendships. I like to keep it on a superficial level, except with my best friend who is autistic with a high IQ whom I only see 3 or 4 times a year. 



Anyway, there's this girl I've been obsessed with for almost a year now. She's incredibly beautiful, I could look at her for hours and never get bored. And she interests me because she has many of the qualities that the ideal girlfriend must have in my head.

She's kind, gentle, intelligent, loves nature and playing video games, and we share the same political values and taste in music.

At the same time, she has traits that I only moderately appreciate: she's sociable, drinks alcohol and likes to go out. 

We've known each other for a year and she's been living in my head. I've already imagined all the scenarios of our ideal couple. Spending whole days in bed, cuddling up in front of wildlife documentaries, playing guitar together, going camping in the mountains, buying a converted van and going on a road trip...

All these daydreams have something in common: they involve the two of us being cut off from social interaction, cut off from reality, in our own bubble. 

I'm afraid I'll be disappointed if we start dating. 

In reality I don't know her that well, we've probably seen each other 4 or 5 times, and I idealize her. 

Anyway, I'd like to call her and ask her out for a drink, since she lives less than 1km from me.

But I know I won't. I guess I'm afraid of being rejected, which has never happened to me in my life since I've never expressed interest in anyone. 

I imagine that all this has to do with the fact that behind my appearance of emotional stability, I'm sorely lacking in self-confidence due to childhood trauma, my mother's lie about my biological parentage, etc. 

How can you form a loving relationship with another human being when you're not even sure you exist, when you feel like a ghost in a human body? 

I'm going to spend my weekend doing typical schizoid things: cook myself a nice meal, take a nap, go for a coffee with friends and then politely slip away under the pretext that I'm tired, then go home and work on my professional projects while continuing to daydream about my crush.

In the end, I'm quite happy like that. 

The relationship I have with this girl in my head is perhaps more fulfilling than actually dating her. At least in my dreams she's perfect and I'm sure I won't be disappointed. 


Writing about my feelings has exhausted me. 

I don't know what answers to expect. 


What do you think of limerence and romantic love in general?

Our maid, who was from a small village said that in their village, milk is sourced ethically. She told me that when the cows are in heat, they are set up with a common male for the whole village. The male gets aroused and they mate. She said that the calves are allowed to drink their share of milk first and the rest is collected. She said that cows have 4 nipples so the calf suckles from one nipple and the milk in the remaining 3 nipples is collected by them. According to her, in her village, cows are only impregnated naturally when they are in heat so they aren't made pregnant unnaturally often or forcibly. When the calves mature, they are either kept by themselves or sold to neighbours or people from similar villages. When a cow can no longer produce milk, it is taken care of till she dies naturally. The cows are taken out if their sheds for washing and roaming in the morning. The cows isn't artificially inseminated or given any injections

i've known her for long and strongly believe she isn't lying. I Just want to know whether there is any hidden cruelty or something in this system too.

I know that processed foods still source their milk from large milk factories, which are obviously very cruel,  so I'll still avoid that but maybe i can consider buying milk from small scale milk producers such as her family for making tea/coffee, cereal, etc. If it really is cruelty free.",4,1744455733.0,VeganIndia,3,0.83,False

It was a mellow Friday night when Jay, the new face in the circle, pulled up to his friends’ place. He wasn’t a complete stranger — he’d known Arman and Luca for a few years now. The kind of friendships where you don’t talk daily, but there’s real respect and a shared understanding. They’d been inviting him to hang out more lately, and this was one of those “meet the crew” type nights.

When Jay stepped into the living room, he immediately noticed Mina — sitting on the couch, posture relaxed, phone nearby, scrolling with one hand while sipping something cold with the other. She looked up and smiled.

“You’re Jay, right?” she asked.
He nodded.
They shook hands and without hesitation, she said, “Your hands are so cold.”

The comment hung there — not flirtatious, not dismissive. Just something intimate enough to make the air shift slightly. She leaned back, studying him with a subtle curiosity, then asked how he knew Arman and Luca. It was casual on the surface, but Jay could tell — she was clocking him. Vetting the energy.

A few minutes later, she put her phone down on the coffee table, screen still lit, and came around to sit at the big kitchen table where the guys were gathered. Jay took a seat too, across from her. The four of them dove into conversation — looping through dumb stories, random takes, half-serious debates. Mina added little things here and there. She wasn’t over-engaged, but when Jay spoke, she listened a bit closer.

At one point, Mina started talking about her boyfriend — Darius.

“He brought me this dry-ass burger earlier,” she said, eyebrows raised in half-annoyance, half-laugh. “Swear the chefs must’ve made it while sleep.”

No one responded much. Jay especially stayed quiet. He caught the subtle thing: she brought up her man, but with no light in her voice. No praise, no affection — just critique. And she avoided saying where Darius worked.

Later, the door opened and Darius came in. He had a tired look about him — hoodie on, eyes low, but trying to shake it off. He greeted everyone, sat down next to Mina, and started talking about something that went right at work. His voice had that tone — trying to sound proud without having much to flex.

Now it was five at the table, and the dynamic had shifted.

Then Mina broke the flow.

She looked at Jay and said, “Where’d you get your shoes?”

Jay, caught slightly off guard, glanced down. He had one leg crossed, so the shoes were kinda visible. Mina was definitely looking.
“These?” he said. “They were a gift.”

Mina’s eyes lit up a little. “Wow. They’re fire.”

Everyone felt the moment shift. Complimenting another guy’s shoes — while your man’s sitting across the table — that’s a choice.

Darius got quiet. His hand came up to rub his face, then stayed there for a second too long. You could see the expression — trying to hide it, but it was clear. He felt something, and it wasn’t good.

The table dipped into a weird silence. Luca cleared his throat and hit everyone with a quick, awkward: “Uhhh… okay then,” trying to pivot the mood.

Then someone brought up food again. Darius looked at Jay, avoiding eye contact.

“You can just have the burger,” he muttered, motioning toward the one he brought earlier. His head dipped, voice low.

Jay, being polite, asked where he worked. Darius finally said it out loud:
“Fast food. One of the chefs made it.”
It landed heavy. Not because of the job — but because of the way he said it. The shame clung to his words.

Minutes later, Mina and Darius disappeared down the hall into their room. Muffled voices turned into low arguing. At first no one could make out what they were saying — until the door creaked open and Mina’s voice cut through.

“Grown ass man.”

Luca, Arman, and Jay just looked at each other for a second. Nobody had to say anything. The vibe was clear: whatever was going on between them didn’t start tonight — Jay just happened to be the mirror that showed them both what was already there.

The rest of the night played out — casual conversation, snacks, scrolling through memes — but the tension lingered.

Jay hadn’t even done much. Sometimes you don’t have to. The room already had cracks — he just walked in and let the light hit them.",1,1744454538.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

For reference, both bathrooms are in neutral locations in one of the halls of our apartment, so nobody has a locational advantage. 

My roommate and I both work jobs that have us out the door by 10am at the latest; which obviously means we need to start getting ready close to the same time. While I typically leave for work an hour later than my roommate everyday, I get in the bathroom about two hours before I even need to leave because I take long showers and have a long bathroom routine. I try to accommodate my roommate by being done right around when they wake up. 

However, without fail, every time I use the bathroom in the morning, I get a knock on my door to signal she needs to pee. This usually happens the second I reach the toilet. Every time, I wrap it up, step out the bathroom, let her do her thing, then go back in. What always seems to irritate me though is the way she will joke and say “the sound of you closing the bathroom door woke me up and I needed to pee!” It’s frustrating because she gets into the bathroom < 45 minutes before she needs to leave for the day. I’ve rather lightheartedly suggested to her that she should adopt my method of getting in the bathroom earlier to have more alone time, and she completely dismissed me. Of course I do understand waking up earlier than needed is a pain, but when you share space with someone else you have to adjust. 

Today, I hit my limit. I had a work event 1.5 hrs away from the apartment that I need to be at by 10am. Factoring in doing hair, skin/body care, making coffee etc, I needed to leave my place by 7:45am to be safe. I even warned her the night before that she may hear me getting up extremely early for that reason and she understood I’d need the bathroom around that time. So I get to the bathroom @ 6am, earlier than my roommate would ever need to be in the bathroom, and of course the same deal. She knocks, asks to use the bathroom because she “needs to go”.  I told her I needed to get ready and she said she only needed to pee, so I obliged. As soon as she comes in, she talks about all the skincare I have on the counter (I always clean up when I’m done, but I hadn’t even started so ofc it was still out) and asked if the bathroom was always this junky when I’m using it. She even goes as far as to tell me I need to be “mindful” of our shared space that, again, I never leave cluttered when I’m finished. 

Since her emergency didn’t seem like an emergency anymore, I kicked her out the bathroom and advised her to hold it or use the bathroom of our mutual friend who lives in the same building as us. She ended up just sulking and going back into her room and when I came out the bathroom she called me an AH for kicking her out of her own bathroom when she needed to go. Maybe I am, but I’m so tired of adjusting my bathroom schedule around her needs. So AITAH?

1jxebzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1jxebzw/frustration_with_second_shot_of_the_day/,Frustration with second shot of the day,"I'm getting increasingly frustrated with my Gaggio Classic Pro E24. I have a 9 bar mod, no PID. I use a DF 54 grinder. I try to keep my brewing routine the same (WDT & self leveling tamper with force spring, puck screen). I turn the machine on when I wake up and let it warm up for about 25 minutes before my first coffee. Since I don't have a built-in PID, I surf the temperature until the temperature light goes out (about 6s). Then I connect the handle, put the scale on, wait for the light to light up for 10s and press the brewing button. The first coffee of the day is ok - 18g in 36g in 29.5s. After that I froth the milk, purge the steam wand and make sure to fill the boiler with fresh water. 

Now I get to the problem. I usually make another coffee after half an hour and repeat the process exactly the same (the Gaggia is on in the meantime), but the coffee just flies through during brewing, 36g flows out in 20 seconds. I've tried many things - opening the steam wand before brewing to release the pressure, not surfing the temperature, backflush, but without improvement. It's all getting on my nerves because it's all too random. 
I don't know if it's the grinder or something else. I'm also descaling it every month, clean a screen, backflush with Cafiza.

I realize that the grinder and coffee machine are in the lower price range and with more expensive ones I mainly gain consistency and I would accept that two coffees, one after the other (back to back), would be a problem for the Gaggia, but not that half an hour passes in between and the second coffee literally flies through with the exact same preparation process. I'm kind of skeptical that PID would bring a solution, because I think that after half an hour the temperature stabilizes quite a bit even without it. Maybe I'm wrong. I know that water temperature affects pressure, but is there actually a solution to this? Does anyone have any advice?

I've seen quite a few posts on Reddit with the same problems, but the advice and solutions are all so different that I get the feeling that this problem is somehow unsolvable. Am I doing something wrong? Is the solution really a PID, Gaggiuino or Gaggimate mod?",1,1744453990.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life often throws many challenges our way, leading to stress and anxiety. In today’s fast-paced world, finding refreshing and healthy ways to cope with these pressures is essential. One exciting option gaining popularity is non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks. These beverages not only offer a unique taste but also come packed with benefits. Let’s explore how these drinks can support your wellness journey and help you tackle stress more effectively.

Adaptogens are natural substances, often herbs, that help the body adapt to stress. By incorporating them into your daily routine through non-alcoholic beverages, you can experience a boost in energy and mood while promoting relaxation. Here’s what makes non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks a worthwhile choice.

### Stress Reduction

One of the primary benefits of non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks is their ability to reduce stress. Ingredients like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and holy basil are known for their calming effects. Consuming these adaptogens can help your body regulate its response to stress, leading to reduced anxiety levels.

### Improved Focus and Clarity

Non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks can enhance your mental clarity and focus. Ingredients such as ginseng and matcha not only offer refreshing tastes but also improve cognitive functions. This can be particularly beneficial when you need to power through a busy workday or maintain concentration during important tasks.

### Increased Energy Levels

Unlike traditional energy drinks loaded with sugar and caffeine, many adaptogen beverages provide a natural energy boost without jitters. Eleuthero and maca root are known to enhance stamina and overall energy. These drinks help you feel more vibrant throughout your day while promoting a healthier lifestyle.

By incorporating a soothing adaptogen drink before bed, you could improve your sleep quality, leading to better rest and recovery.

### Antioxidant Properties

Many non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks contain powerful antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress. Ingredients like turmeric and hibiscus not only add flavor but also offer health benefits. These antioxidants help protect your body from free radicals, supporting your overall wellness.

### Hydration with a Twist

Healthy hydration is crucial, and non-alcoholic adaptogen drinks add a refreshing twist to water intake. They provide flavors that keep you excited about staying hydrated. Plus, many of these beverages are low in calories and sugar-free, making them a guilt-free choice.

Do you think, based on this fact, she will release other unreleased songs in the future like Simple, The Box and others? (Maybe with the anniversaries of her albums, as it was with One of The Boys where A Cup of Coffee and I Think I'm Ready were released). In this discussion I would include the Christian music album she made at 16. Is it possible that Katy will finally make peace with it and make it available at least for her fans and those who still support her, despite everything? I have to admit that I've listened to it quite a bit lately and I think it deserves to be known and made public to people, I know that in the interview with Zane Lowe on Apple she admitted that that album is also part of her musical journey, basically saying that her published studio albums are actually 7 and not 6 (despite 143, indicated with KP6), technically 6 made under the name of Katy Perry and 1 made under her real name Katy Hudson. Do I see it as a first step of reconciliation with the album itself or maybe I'm dreaming a little too much? Do you think she will do it in the future?",2,1744453764.0,katyheads,9,0.75,False

Tldr: Need good recipies for alternative milk.

I have trouble to get nice foaming results out of the Nanofoamer Pro 2 with milk alternatives. Most of the time foam is too thick to pour any latte art, sometime it happens that there is no foam at all. I tried different brands and different levels (1-5) with all three propellers.

Most of the time I go for the minimum amount of milk (1 small coffedrink) because I dont want to waste milk. I start with the blue propeller and level 2-3 as recommended. I even tried the black one on lvl 3-4 which is recommended for small milk amounts. But even if I go for the medium amount it wont change to better results.

Im starting to assume that the milk directly from the fridge is too cold for good results. I still need to try the same settings with cold and room temperature milk.

I dont really get the hang of it, the milk never gets silky for pouring nice drinks and it can get frustrating sometimes.

Do you have tips or even recipies for alternative milk?",1,1744453568.0,latteart,2,1.0,False

Way overkill for my needs, but it’s a bargain. I can’t find any reviews on the machine though?
