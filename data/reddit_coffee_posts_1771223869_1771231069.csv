UPDATE","UPDATE: Identical twins fix everything, apparently. HR paused the internship after the disaster at the networking event and scheduled formal meetings. I fully expected to be banned from the company. Now things could be very Shakespearean. When Lily saw my brother and realized there were actually two of us, something shifted. She’d always described liking “Max” because he was thoughtful, calm, and surprisingly good at talking through design ideas. She met my actual brother — who shares a lot of those traits — and she realized she hadn’t been “deceived” into feelings. She just connected with someone she thought was him. And, plot twist: my brother and Lily actually got along immediately. In person. As themselves. No impersonation required. They’ve since gone on a very real, very honest coffee date. Meanwhile, William asked to speak to me privately — as me, not as “Max.” He admitted that what hurt wasn’t the romantic confusion. It was the breach of trust. But he also said the person he respected — the one he stayed up late debating architecture decisions with — was me. Not my name. Not my gender. Me. He’d been so fixated on Lily that he hadn’t realized his closest connection at work wasn’t actually with her. HR ultimately made a compromise: the original internship under Max’s name was terminated, but they offered me a short-term contract under my real identity to finish the project I’d worked on. Official paperwork, transparency with the team, and very clear boundaries. As for William — we agreed to keep things professional until my contract ends. But we’ve started over, honestly this time. No disguises. No triangles. Just awkward, real conversations. So in the end:

My brother is recovering and unexpectedly dating Lily. I’m finishing the internship as myself. William finally sees me clearly. HR has probably added “twin verification protocol” to onboarding. It was chaotic, dramatic, and unnecessarily complicated — but somehow everyone ended up where they were supposed to be.",1,1771231022.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I just bought a book for my wife, that explains myths, gods and heroes from the Greek antiquity through the use of famous paintings. The book has very nice pictures, as well as many good explanations and details about those stories.

1r6475v,https://i.redd.it/c74h7sacgtjg1.jpeg,Proving a thesis (revised),"Thaumaturgy is the act of making magic work for its user. This comes in many forms in these modern times. Magitech, orbnet communication,  and wands and staves make casting easier for the average spellcaster with lower and lower risk of calamity or personal harm.  However, Thaumaturgy has its humble origins traced back to multiple ancient cultures across the globe. Records of these civilizations describe the binding of spirits via sacrifice, pacts, and sacred names. Archeological records indicate that human population numbers were exploding after the discovery of thaumaturgy.  Many wrote down how to contact these spirits in the very first  Grimoirs ever recorded.  The Book of Enoch actually provides a great insight into how these ancient spirits perceived humans.  
  
“1 And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. 2 And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ""Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.""  
  
\- the Book of Enoch  
  
The sun shewn high the divine light of the heavens, which illuminated the wickedness in the hearts of all creation. Live sacrifices from Greedy men hungry for power fed the fallen children of the heavens.  These sacrifices were not always willing.. And this pleased some wicked spirits even more than others. However, those who made these sacrifices were often greatly rewarded while the sacrificed rarely had any say in their fate afterward... The goodness of men seemed to have died out as the lust for power and wealth outgrew the love of their neighbor. Frivolous wars raged on, only to be interrupted by erratic weather. One could call this the inspiration for modern day evocation.    
  
The weather here was erratic. There were no seas and oceans. The world was akin to a misty garden under constant dew and mud. A swamp of sorts. Colossal  Mountains and plateaus mark this era in particular.   
  
 (Genesis 6:14): ""Make thee an ark of gopherwood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch"" (KJV).

  
All this was but an excerpt of Yarla’s masters thesis. The stack of papers reeked of Monster stamina potions.  Professor Wimbledor, held it in his hands with disgust, and utter skepticism having read it in its entirety.  
  


“Every Culture has a Great flood story, every culture has demons and fallen angels one could deduce demons were everywhere until a great global flood event wiped them out.” Yarla explained for the 15th time to her Professor…  
  
Professor Wimbledor furrowed his elderly brow. Never in all of his tenure had any student written a thesis that seemed ike such bullshit.  He adjusted his red ceremonial hat uncomfortably. The empty lecture hall was a relief. Even still, trying to tell a student they’re gonna fail this class felt embarrassing. This thesis read like a conspiracy theory, the kind  that posits the earth is flat and the Gods tell us its round to mess with us.    
  
“Surely there's more proof,  you know I can't accept this in its current state.” The professor sighed in sheer disappointment.   
  


  
Yarla was right where she began the conversation again.  Professor Wimbledor hadn't even \*looked\* at the bibliography. This would be the 16th repetition of her explanation of her sources and her theory.  This theory was grounded in geological record,  cross-referenced with at least 30 religions and their telling of the great flood event.  To the university’s knowledge, there were at least 405 separate religions that mention the great flood and life before it.  Perhaps her thesis was missing something.  If it was artifacts,  Yarla already analyzed 24 in this thesis already from various arcane corners of academia. Mayhaps its the fact that there's no archeological record of this civilization that many other civilizations point to in their stories. Except… Yarla remembered the [latest issue of popular demonics.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1qltc2o/the_end_of_the_pyramid_isles/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  Her frustration briefly gave way to a smile.   
  
“I think I know where I could get more proof. I just need a boat.”  The student suggested.   
  
This made her professor burst into laughter. The hell would a masters student with a thesis due in a month do with a boat?  Furthermore, it wasn't like she was the best student, Yarla was in fact just barely passing so far.  Handing in a thesis with no proof of such a missing civilization would destroy any chance of her passing this class.  What proof she did have only existed in extreme coincidence.     
  
“I mean, you could try, but I don't think that the university council will approve.” Wimbledor wheezed.  
  
""What do you mean the council won't approve? I can't complete my thesis without this trip!"" The student sighed in frustration. ""the incident on Pyramid island is all over Popular Demonics! I dare say, it's possible that Pyramid island could be the perfect location to investigate based on geological record and existing religious accounts.""  
  
Yarla pulled up images from the article to show The professor and explain the similarities in linguistic design to one of  the oldest known languages to all of our arcane world written on the wall. The wizard with a PHD, wearing red, furrowed his brow.  The thought of a possible lost civilization that served as a cradle for all civilization being there seemed preposterous. Archeological records certainly did not display a timeline where civilization started on a chain of islands populated by Goblins.  If anything, the latest archeological record placed it much farther south.  Alas, here was his masters student, seeking to prove that there was an older civilization with its remnants sitting intact, right under our noses. 



""Miss Yarla,  I'm afraid you would get laughed out of ANY scholarly institution foe requesting funding based on some... conspiracy theory."" The wizard in red began.



""The IRIN, the NEKOTEPH, the MAYANS , the Ithics, THE ACIREMANS, THE DEELUT, THE FENRI, EVEN THE THRELL...almost every ancient civilization has a variant of the great flood story.  Each account speaks of boats being built to survive that apocalyptic flood."" Yarla argued, producing a packet of evidence listing each culture with a flood story, their similarities in EACH story. ""not to mention, the geological record telling us there weren't seas as we knew them at some point during sapient civilization.  It would be academically irresponsible to refuse to at least send SOMEONE for a cursory dig Professor Wimbledor.""



""You're making a fool of yourself. If you're wrong, this could end any chance of graduation you have, given how far in the course we are as a class."" Professor Wimbledor warned with an expression that screamed the need for more coffee. 

""as it stands, your thesis will likely fail without more proof.""



""if the council approves my dig and a boat to get me to the dig, then i can get more proof!"" The agitated student groaned as she placed her orb on the professor's orb stand. ""ALL the books Ive cited, ALL the orb-sites and articles,  all listed and they point to something older than the Irraluns of the continent of the former cat-folk empire. Yet there's no study out there, no other artifacts, and no other reports that mention it directly.  It's only a few Thousand EON notes. I already have dig tools. Just LET THE COUNCIL SEE MY FUNDS APPROPRIATION PROPOSAL!""  
  
The professor's hands were on his hips at this point. He had done all he could to try and talk his least promising student out of this ridiculous idea that would likely get her killed.  Wimbledor read the popular demonic article she cited this morning.  The contents weren't pretty.   The determined expression on Yarla's face did nothing to sway his opinion of just how stupid this idea was.  However, his obligation as professor was to relay this funds appropriation request to the university council. 

""Are you sure the hieroglyphs in the images there are part of a story that mentions this global flood? Popular Demonics is just a tabloid publication after all. "" The wizard in red confirmed one last time.

""Of course, I just need to go to that island and translate it, and see if I can bring back artifacts for mana-dating!"" the student explained with the exasperation that comes with your teacher asking the same questions over and over again.  
  
 ""Very well...but the council is still not paying for the trip."" Professor Wimbledor sighed in the same exasperation that comes with one of your stubborn students not catching the hints you are dropping all morning.  
  
With that done, Yarla left the lecture hall in fury. Now was the time to pack. And hire a fishing boat or something. She made sure to stash her orb in her skirt’s pocket of holding.

1r63qog,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r63qog,Superstar II Aurora Coffee - Like wearing an Espresso Martini!,"If tracking is to be believed it turns out I have a few deliveries coming this week, some much delayed, funny how it works, like busses, you wait ages for one and then four arrive at once. But I think that is going to have to be that for a while, so I am going to make sure I enjoy opening them when they get here, as it might be a little while before more come.

First to arrive today was these awesome Superstars I used up some points to buy from adidas. I had been looking at these since they were released and always knew I would end up buying them. I already do have a pair of Superstar II that I got very cheap in the outlet last year, just really to try to be honest, I didn't think I would end up wearing them much. I never really liked the Superstar style, too big, too clunky, the shelltoe just looked so 80s and too young for me. But I figured it was worth just trying while I got a great bargain.

It turns out I really loved wearing them. In fact, they are easily the pair of shoes I wear more than any other pair. I don't go out, out, in them as such, but they are the first pair I grab if I am just nipping to the shops, or walking the dog, or whatever I am doing that doesn't require me to look my sharpest. Easily the most comfortable pair of adidas I have, and I am going to suggest they are the most comfortable of any adidas streetwear models. There is so much padding, the soles are bouncy and very thick. Just a really great allrounder pair.

I do see the Superstar II's get some stick around here, and never understand why. Yeah they are nowhere near as retro as the Superstar 82, or as cool looking at the Superstar Vintage but they are very nice to wear, and if you get a nice colourway I think they can look great.

LIke this one, the Aurora Coffee - or to give it it's full name: Aurora Coffee / Off White / Stone Khaki (IH9314). Where my existing Superstar II is leather, this is Nubuck - and it looks, and feels, so nice. Such a lovely shoe, I was really chuffed when I got it out of the box to see it was even nicer in hand that the pictures made it look.

I am relieved to be very happy with this purchase!",8,1771228835.0,adidas,1,1.0,False

I really am into men. There was a guy, (36M) whom we both have worked with, and been friends with, that transferred back from the shipping area to the line at the warehouse we work at. Me and him went on a few dates a while back and we got it off so we’ll, we decided if the future allows it, because he has a busy life, I’m busy as well, we should try dating one day.

Me and her have been really good friends, she’s been like a mother figure, but when she crosses that line I let her know I’m not interested, politely. (She’s also married to her husband of 10yrs) But she has done back stabby stuff behind my back if another guy likes me. Like telling people I have a crush on certain guys that are married when I don’t, (and I addressed her) m.Getting one of them fired because he said I did a good job on the line and she said she would be the one to decide if I do a good job or not and she let the higher ups know he was doing a bad job at leadership. (She doesn’t know that I know she had something to do with it.) but the other leaders are cool so with me, so they told me one day she was the one who falsely reported him. (She’s also a supervisor ). I let it go.

I was really excited to hear he’s transferring back and so was she but she says he a basic worker, nothing too interesting about him. But he’s cool to talk to. I said that he’s actually really good, and I think he’s cute. She got on alert then and was like: “why do you think he’s cute? There’s nothing too special about him! He can’t give you the life you want!”  I told her you don’t know the life I want. And besides, he and I are just friends. Thinking I could trust her, I told her about the dates we went on, ( the movies, state fair, coffee dates).

Another coworker decided to celebrate him coming back, saying we should go out for sushi. The supervisor said she wanted to be the one to invite him. I asked him if we could hang outside of work so he could tell me about his other department. He was excited and said yes!

As me and random coworkers are coming back from lunch, the supervisor lady is talking to him in the corner whispering. She came back with a smug smile on her face saying she invited him. One of my other coworkers said “that was a long invite). She shrugged her shoulders with a smug smile.

Next thing I know, when we go out, he’s extremely distant, and seemed a little on edge with me.  When he would talk to me, we had our own intimate conversations aside from everyone else and he’d be all smiles. And she would be watching. Then she’d start to flirt with him, and talk over me when I try to speak.

He later texted me saying we should not hang out outside of work anymore and keep it strictly platonic. I’m like “What happened?” He said “he doesn’t want things to get messy at work. “

I asked her if she said anything to him? She said “No! I didn’t say anything. But maybe you should leave him alone. Just don’t get all emotional over it and let it go. Now you still have me!”

I want to ask him but he’s been avoiding me. ( Waiting until I leave to come into the break room, leaving early so we don’t interact). But still having full blown conversations with her, just not me. I texted him a couple of movies he might be interested in (because we both always talk about them) and he sent me a thumbs up two days later.

I asked her if he still talks to her? She put her hands up and is like “don’t be mad at me but we only talked about his weekend, past people we worked with, and silly moments at the sushi putting. That’s all!”

It just feels so weird to me that he would go from being my friend to cold shouldering me. I think she said something like a lie about me to him, AITAH for thinking so?

1r63mqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r63mqy,Under Seige. Gondor Calls for Aid.,"27 F, Posting from USA

Hello. I am posting here as a last resort. Rest assured, this gremlin is not in danger of being rehomed, but he's about to be placed under severe house-arrest if things don't take a 180 and fast.

Butterbean is a 8mo NM DSH Sonic parking-lot model that was bestowed to me at work as a fresh out of the oven newborn. He was bottle-fed by yours truly while under the supervision of veteran bottle-feeders and an army of vets who also became sentimentally attached to his wellbeing (I work as an overnight ER Vet nurse at a specialty hospital).

He is now in his psychotic internet-troll teenager phase. This is shown through his willingness and ability to eat /everything/. He will eat anything that even remotely resembles or smells like food. He just got over having to have a sedated ultrasound and lymph node biopsy after he ATE FIREWOOD. Literally tore off pieces of firewood to eat whole that caused severe GI inflammation that had him out of commission for nearly a week before he got back to feeling better with the help of meds and close monitoring.

I have tried to ensure there are never dirty dishes in the sink because he will lick and chew on anything that has even a trace of food on it. No food is allowed on the counter because he will chew through plastic and cardboard packaging to get to it. Even drinks need to be guarded as he has snuck sips of hot chocolate and coffee if it is left unguarded for even a moment.

He just spawns like an NPC if there is anything even remotely edible within the home.

He needs to be locked in a different room during breakfast and dinner feeding times because he enhales his food and then bullies his siblings away from their food. I have tried slow feeders to try and get him to slow down but he just flips them.

Now, tonight, he managed to actually open and raid closed cabinet drawers and helped himself not to one, but two whole packages of flour tortillas. And some bread.

I am going to purchase some child locks, but the main issue is that he is using the counter space as a personal buffet 24/7. No amount of reprimanding or constantly making sure we remove him from the counter everytime he is up there is working. He gets played with constantly (with us or with his siblings) and has no shortage of cat trees and other interactive toys to play with when we are not around and the other cats dont feel like playing. But no matter what, his #1 priority is always finding his next snack by any means necessary. I am convinced he would 100% push me down the stairs if it meant he got a single honeybun out of it (he is obsessed with them in particular for some reason, despite us fighting like hell to not let him get any).

TL;DR

Kitten is forcing us to lockdown the house due to his insatiable want for snacks. The counter-space is a warzone, and he laughs in the face of our laws. Need ideas to curb this rebellion before he ends up in the hospital a second time.

Pics include him at his daily affirmation station where he stares at his reflection for 10-20minutes early in the morning before he begins the daily shenanigans, a picture of him 2 weeks ago in hospital after he corked his intestines with firewood like the world trashiest bottle of champagne, and a bonus picture of when he was tinier but no less food-motivated.",10,1771228432.0,CATHELP,3,1.0,False

We absolutely enjoy staying out of the heavy tourist areas and experiencing more of the local Vibes when we go on vacation and boy did we find the perfect place! First of all, we rented a car ( $160 for 6 days) since neither of us are comfortable on scooters, we had a lot of luggage, and transportation is imperative to vacation the way we do. We ended up booking an incredible Airbnb in Lipa Noi. If you look at a map of Koh Samui on the far western side there is a small peninsula in the Lipa Noi area and our Airbnb was almost directly beside the entrance to the naval base on that peninsula, so realistically at the dead end road. Having said that, the villa was extremely inexpensive (even though it was across the street from a 12,000 sq.ft Villa that rents for $5,000 a night) had access to our own private beach, our own swimming pool and as it turns out a ton of our needs met within walking distance.

Nanus - a surprisingly good Italian restaurant just out of the drive from our Villa open daily till 10:00 p.m.

Directly beside Nanus was a small local place called Farm and Table cafe. Beachfront, served local Thai food as well as alcohol (and cannabis according to their sign)and had a very laid back comfy vibe. We walked into classic rock playing and found ourselves there for either food or a nightcap almost every night.( I talked to the owner about her not having any online presence and she said she wasn't ready yet because she wasn't fully staffed. this was evidenced by the fact that one of the days we were there she wasn't even open)

300 yards away was the Think Retro Cafe We went here for a breakfast on the beach almost every day(200baht for an American breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and coffee/tea) they have a happy hour every day from 5:00 to 6:00 where all cocktails are 99 baht (normally 180-220). they have a very large beachfront with tables or bean bags and a really cool interior Lounge area with again a great vibe.

Across the street from think was the local massage parlor with extremely reasonable prices and we found ourselves there several times and very happy with the service.

Finding this little corner of the island for us was amazing. we had everything we needed within easy walking distance if we chose to and we're easily able to get anywhere else on the island within 40 minutes to do the more touristy things that we did at times.

if you're looking for a total relaxation experience on Koh Samui I would highly recommend this small little area. if anyone is interested I can post the link to our specific Airbnb in the comments. We rented a two bedroom Villa each bedroom with its own ensuite bathroom. The place was totally private and secluded and very secure. We paid less than $800 US for 6 nights. 

Definitely our type of vacation! we've left there and are now in Chiang Mai for a week then Chiang Rai for 3 days before we return to the US",2,1771228024.0,kohsamui,2,1.0,False
1r63ie6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Regrets/comments/1r63ie6/i_female_regret_being_in_a_female_led_relationship/,I (female) regret being in a female led relationship,"I need to get this off my chest. Even if my story sounds bizarre, I promise it’s real. In hindsight, I feel stupid about my life decisions.

For context: I met my ex right before serious COVID lockdowns started, when I had just moved to a new city. During those lockdowns, he was basically my main social connection. Otherwise, I don’t think this relationship would have happened.

Additional context: he has severe social anxiety. 

I (33F) was in a 5-year relationship with my ex-boyfriend (42M) where I was the Domme, and he was my slave. At the time, I thought being a Domme would mean getting respect and devotion from men who would submit to me, try extra hard to please me, and treat me like a goddess. That was what I was seeking.

Me and my ex met on FetLife for a domme/sub dynamic, and it was casual at first but turned into a romantic relationship. Early on, he suggested that it be a female-led relationship (FLR), and I agreed. It sounded good at the time. The setup of this relationship gave me a false sense of security because I thought he would devote himself to me. That did not happen. I kept waiting for our entire relationship for it to happen.

Instead, I ended up in a relationship with an extremely passive man. He didn't do anything. I made all of our plans, decided everything, made sure we had dates, initiated sex, initiated everything basically (phone calls, time together, etc). I was responsible for everything. I didn't like it. Being the initiator of everything all the time made me feel uncared for. And sometimes if I did less, waiting to see if he would step up - he wouldn't. 

He made significantly more money than me, but we split everything 50/50. He insisted on this and made it clear that he didn’t like the idea of paying for me. When we talked about moving in together, he said he would still want to split 50/50 even though he earned way more than I did. I got gifts for him, but he never got gifts for me.

He only expressed himself affectionately and said loving and passionate things when he was horny, usually when I was engaging with his fetishes (small penis humiliation). Outside of those moments, he was just closed off, passive, unromantic. Meanwhile, I was affectionate. 1.5 years in, I told him I loved him and he did not say it back. This happened multiple times over a year, and it hurt and humiliated me so much that I basically had to teach him: “When I say I love you, I expect to hear it back.”

I had to train him to show me affection, and somehow I accepted that this was part of the Domme-sub dynamic. I told myself, *this is fine, this is part of my role.* I betrayed my own emotional needs, falsely believing I was somehow empowered. 

He didn’t want to do even basic acts of devotion, like bringing me coffee at my hair appointment, because he was afraid people would know he was my slave.

He never carried my heavy things. He never helped me. He never cooked for me, even though I asked many times. He would sigh deeply as if it was a huge burden. Even things he enjoyed doing in his own free time, like fixing broken things and investing in stocks, when I asked for help with those things, he made it seem like I was burdening him and like I should just figure it own on my own. I guess that's what I get for being a Domme. I'm supposed to do it all. I'm the leader, I should just figure everything out. 

The only time he would help me was if I found a way to link it to his fetishes.

At some point, I realized that this “female-led relationship”  benefited him—only him. He got to be extremely passive, carry no responsibilities, and have his fetishes fulfilled. He got to be free from ""the burden"" of being romantic or taking initiative. I just accepted this even though I felt like I was emotionally starved. I wanted devotion, affection, and to see someone who cared about me enough to make an effort to please me. At the time, I was in too deep and convinced that what I was doing was somehow empowering.

It gets worse.

In the first year of being together, he didn’t want to take photos of me because he was afraid someone would figure out that we met on FetLife (even though our FetLife photos were very anonymous and didn't show our faces). I had to convince him to relax and take photos with me.

He didn’t tell his family he had a girlfriend until we had been together for four years. He never told his friends about me. Never. The entire five years we were together, his friends didn’t know he had a girlfriend. Meanwhile, he met my friends and spent time with my social circle. This makes me feel pathetic. 

We were talking about moving in together, getting married, and having kids, while he couldn’t even tell his friends he had a girlfriend. He couldn't even cook dinner for me without me either reminding him 10 times or finding a way to use his fetish to get him to cook dinner. 

At some point I realized: I cannot believe I am doing this. This is not what a loving relationship is supposed to be. I cannot believe that I convinced myself this was empowering.

I thought being in a female-led relationship would mean I received guaranteed devotion. That all my needs would be fulfilled. None of that happened. Finally, I was honest with myself. I wasn't in love with him. I don't think he loved me. This whole relationship was built off me being really good at responding to his fetishes and using that to influence his behavior. It wasn't built off actual love or devotion. I feel used. 

Now, I know better. I want a relationship with a man who is not passive. A man who will devote himself to me without it needing to be linked to his fetish.

I’m posting this regret here for anyone else who may end up in a similar situation. Don't lie to yourself. If your relationship isn't working, do not cling to any narrative about why it's actually fine. It's not fine. Let yourself seek what you truly want. 

  
TLDR: 

I stayed in a Domme/sub “female-led” relationship expecting devotion and respect, but instead ended up emotionally neglected, hidden, and used mainly to fulfill his fetish. ",2,1771227987.0,Regrets,2,1.0,False
1r63i2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1r63i2t/a_rough_day_at_work/,A Rough day at work.,"The first irst thing Tom noticed when he went outdoors was the snow drift.

Which was odd, because it had been almost fifty degrees outside for the past two weeks and as far as he could tell, the temperature didn't feel any different today.

It followed the line of his front yard along the sidewalk perfectly and blocked the very end of his driveway.

It was about nine feet deep and frozen solid.

So being a thinker rather than a worrier he called an Uber and then called his workplace to let his boss know he would be at least fifteen minutes late.

An hour later his Uber arrived. It was being driven by a balding man who was so short he had to sit on three phone books duct-taped together, and used his cane to press the gas and brake pedals. 

The car smelled of boiled cabbage and freshly dug up potatoes, the front dash was an absolute cluster of coffee stained road maps, the driver had a map scotch taped to the steering wheel. 

Tom recognized the shape of the county immediately, he should considering how long he lived there.

Polka music blared from the radio.

"" You sit in back! Front seat broken!"" Yelled the driver.

Tom peered at the front seat next to the driver. It appeared to be made entirely out of duct tape and a few bits of faux leather for style.

The back seat wasn't much better, it sank right down to the frame when you put your weight on it.

The drive was filled with cursing. Many of it filtering from outside through the window from irate drivers having to put up with the drunken turtle impersonation the Uber was doing.

I am trying to write an article (not sure yet what I’ll do with it, but just wanted to channel some strong feelings) about incorrect or incoherent Urdu used in modern pop culture, media, or urban spaces in India. It intrigues me how Urdu and its associated prestige and literary heft is used as an aesthetic by people who cannot read the script and do not regularly interact with Urdu speakers, with the assumption that correctness or coherence doesn’t matter, because actual Urdu readers aren’t imagined as part of their clientele. There are some examples that I am most keen on talking about:

1. In the movie Dhurandhar which is supposedly based in Karachi, there’s a scene in which a person is flipping through a handwritten diary. The diary has disjoint letters and words that make no sense (میچ بال فٹ فیصل maybe a software rendering error couldn’t work with right to left text, and on another page م سا ق ن ب which was ‘translated’ as ‘Bin Qasim’ in the subtitles). I was also very intrigued when they showed a paper news daily which had

the

1. front page headline in a tacky Naskh-based font, when no physical newspaper in Urdu would print like that.
2. A popular coffee chain in Delhi and Mumbai, I wont name them, has this whole thing of using Urdu text as part of their decor. Presumably without an Urdu speaker on payroll, because they misspell tohfa on their bespoke gift boxes (توفاح ), they misspell the name of the city they’re based in on a mural inside (دیللی ), and in a trilingual signboard, translate ‘Hello’ as آداب   The word of course exists, but it seems like a strange choice rather than salaam in an establishment that’s otherwise very big on advertising their ‘undivided Punjab’ roots. Literally none of the scores of Pak Punjabi people I’ve met would ever say aadaab.

Four

1. language signboards in Delhi, where the Urdu text is seemingly often written without consultation with a person literate in the script, leading to such things like ہوز خاس instead of حوض خاص

My issue is not with Urdu being used at all by those who do not know the script - that is a great thing and I hope to see more of it. My issue is with this idea that Urdu as an aesthetic can be used without engaging with people who use it as a living language, these are establishments with deep pockets and easy access to native speakers. The coffee place, in fact, is a short walk from Ghalib Academy in Delhi. Also the phenomenon that those who use Urdu as an aesthetic don’t imagine people who read and write Urdu being part of their clientele, therefore this idea that errors don’t matter and there’s no need to proof read, because ‘who can even tell’.

Chapter 1 

I was working late at the office when my husband’s secretary, Lynn, suddenly sent me a SEXY photo. 

In the picture, she was wearing a tiny bikini, clinging to my husband on a beach in Cancun, both of them beaming with joy. 

The caption was pure provocation: “Hey Seraphina, Dave says I’m the one he really loves. He told me not to tell you, but I just felt too sorry for 

you.” 

I stared at the photo for three seconds, and then I smiled. 

I calmly forwarded the photo to the print shop downstairs with a note: “100 copies, A3 color, rush order.” 

An hour later, I personally plastered those photos over EVERY single inch of the office. 

Now, let the show BEGIN. 

My phone screen lit up. 

Lynn Bennett had sent a photo. 

The beach in Cancun looked golden and blindingly bright. 

She was wearing a bikini that barely covered anything, hugging a man tightly. 

That man was my husband, Dave Collins. 

The two of them were grinning at the camera, their teeth perfectly white. 

Below the photo was a line of text. 

“Seraphina, Dave says I’m his favorite person.” 

“He was afraid of hurting you, so he told me to keep it quiet.” 

“But seeing you working overtime all by yourself… it’s just too pathetic.” 

I stared at the photo. 

For three seconds. 

And then I laughed. 

My finger swiped, and I forwarded the photo, 

I sent it to the 24-hour print shop downstairs. 

I typed my instructions into the chat box. 

“A3 coated paper, color, 100 copies.” 

“Rush order. I’ll be down to pick them up in an hour.”

I saved all my files and clocked out. 

The office building was fully lit. 

On my floor, the design department, half the team was still there. 

Everyone saw me and gave me a nod and a smile. 

“Still here, Seraphina?” 

“Yeah, just finished up a milestone.” 

I replied, my expression the same as always. 

The elevator went down to the first floor. 

The shop owner had already wrapped a thick stack of photos in brown paper. 

The paper was still warm. 

“Here’s your order, Ms. Weaver.” 

“Thanks, Ben.” 

I scanned the code to pay. 

Clutching those 100 A3 color prints, I stepped back into the elevator. 

I pressed the button for the 17th floor. 

The elevator doors opened. 

I walked over to the department’s bulletin board. 

It was covered with the latest project notices and “Employee of the Month” awards.

1r635ih,https://i.redd.it/82046qnb6tjg1.png,Game idea: Sleepy Warrior,"The story 

Basically there's you, a kid with a father who's always tired from work and never has the time to play with. So one night, you get visited by a Warrior Fairy who offers to fulfill a wish. And you wish you'll go on a fantastic journey with your father who will be an awesome warrior and fight monsters together. 

Every night you enter a fantastic realm where your father is a sleepy warrior who constantly needs coffee in order to keep on fighting. 

The game - interface 

The pov is from the back. You see a great dwarf warrior's back (imagine a character from World of Warcraft who walks and fights) who always walks through a forest and slashes monsters automatically. 

On a side of the screen there's a place for a pet - you are the pet in the story, it's the way you help your father in his journey. 

Pet screen - chooose what type of pet (animal, bird, insect etc). 

On the other side there's a place for Equipment. Here you upgrade the warrior's stuff. The belt, sword, shield etc. 

The coffee - choose how strong, what type etc. 

The weather - choose the boost. 

When the warrior finishes 10 levels, he jumps from the forest into a desert area so you have to modify the weather like bringing clouds in the desert so the warrior doesn't get tired from the heat - or he needs more coffee. 

You see a static screen with a timeline for 10 levels where you setup rain, then clear sky, then clouds - so you balance the journey through the heat for the time your warrior stays in the desert area. 

This will be tricky because you can set a clear sky and the warrior will become very powerful but with less stamina for more strikes so the level will take longer. You will need to think things through. 

The main action - fighting the boss every 10 levels 

Each boss has a certain technique to attack so here, before the fight, you get a static screen with a timeline of actions: imagine a line with 6 points. 

On each point there is a certain chance that the boss will strike, dodge or heal itself. You choose on each point what the warrior will do: attack, block or drink coffee (to get force and healing). 

Each point will show like: point 1 / 46% boss attack > choose action. Point 2 / 20% boss heals. And so on. 

The experience 

Ads will bring speed and other things and will not be mandatory. 

Everything the warrior does will be funny but ""mighty"". 

Boss fight. 

When he attacks, he jumps with his axe and strike but then he will complain that his hand hurts. 

When he dodges he actually trips and falls and he comments like ""I found my glasses"" or something. 

When he drinks coffee he keeps a hand up like ""wait a second"" and the boss looks confused. 

His voice will have a strong irish tone and accent. 

The graphics 

Can be 2d but 3d will look much better. The style will be sort of like the latest Dune: Spice Wars game, so polished. 

The Rewards 

Top players based on the speed you choose the fight style and strategy (weather setup, upgraded items/pet). 

Skins/weapons/loot etc. 

I have a million ideas to grow this game with new options and upgrades.

My goal was to channel a bit of that '90s alt vibe into something genuinely **functionalist** – a look that feels put-together, a little subversive, but still totally wearable for a coffee run or even a casual meeting.

It's easy enough to throw on a bold lip or a sharp wing, but a *diffused, muted eye* with an unconventional color for everyday? That felt like a genuine challenge, especially when trying to avoid looking sickly or just plain messy. After a few attempts that definitely leaned more ""messy"" than ""masterpiece,"" I landed on something I'm actually pretty stoked about.

Here's the lowdown on my latest practical alt beauty experiment:

*   **The Vibe:** Imagine a slightly faded '90s band tee, but make it makeup. Not perfectly polished, but intentionally lived-in. A hint of literary gothic moodiness, but pared down for the daytime.
*   **Key Products & Price Points (rough estimates):**
    *   **Eyeshadow Base/Smudgy Liner:** *NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in 'Dark Brown'* (around $5-$8). This is my secret weapon for adding depth quickly.
    *   **Main Eye Color:** A specific shade from the *Juvia's Place Warrior III Palette* (the deep, almost muddy olive green called 'Brave' – palette usually $15-$20). If you don't have this, any rich, muted olive or army green matte shadow will do.
    *   **Contrast/Blend Color:** A dusty mauve/plum matte shade from an older *Morphe palette* (e.g., something like 'Deep Plum' if it exists, or just a muted berry tone; full palettes often $12-$25).
    *   **Liner:** *ELF Liquid Liner in Black* (approx. $3).
    *   **Mascara:** Any basic black mascara (I used an *Essence Lash Princess* dupe for around $5).
    *   **Face/Lips:** Kept it super minimal – just a little concealer and a nude lip balm.
*   **Application & Technique (Roughly 10-15 minutes for eyes):**
    1.  **Base Layer:** I smudged the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil along my upper lash line, extending it slightly outwards, and then lightly along the outer half of my lower lash line. Blended it out softly with a small fluffy brush. This provides a deep, slightly grungy base for the green.
    2.  **Green Power:** I packed the olive green shadow (Juvia's Place 'Brave') directly over the smudged brown pencil on my upper lid, staying below the crease. Then, with a *very* light hand and a fluffy brush, I diffused the edges slightly upwards, but kept the main intensity close to the lash line.
    3.  **Subtle Contrast:** Here's where it got interesting. I took a tiny bit of the dusty mauve/plum shadow and *lightly* blended it into the *outermost corner* of the green on my upper lid, and just barely kissed the lower lash line's outer corner. This subtle touch helps prevent the green from looking too flat or making me look unwell, adding a surprising dimension without being obvious.
    4.  **Defined but Soft:** A thin line of black liquid liner, kept close to the upper lash line, with a tiny, barely-there wing. Then, a couple of coats of mascara.
*   **Aesthetic Inspiration:** My brain was bouncing between that ""I just listened to a Sonic Youth album and then went grocery shopping"" vibe and a more pared-back **functionalist** approach to color. It's about using those unconventional hues in a way that blends into daily life without screaming ""look at my makeup!""

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

My first few attempts with a direct green shadow just looked... sickly. I tried too much, too high up, and didn't use a grounding base. It turns out that building the color on a *brown* base first, then diffusing *just the edges*, was key. And that tiny, almost imperceptible hint of plum/mauve? That was the game-changer for me. It neutralized some of the harsher green tones and made it feel more intentional and less accidental. It’s not ""flawless"" by any means – the edges are meant to be a little soft and imperfect – but it looks cohesive and feels true to the aesthetic I was aiming for. It also reaffirmed that you don't need a huge budget for these experiments; strategic drugstore finds and a few versatile palettes go a long way.

I feel deeply sorry for all of those affected by this severe weather, and I am incredibly thankful to all of those involved restoring our vital infrastructure.

Our solar/battery system took over yesterday when various trees fell onto the power lines. We continued life normally. Oven on, TV on, internet up and running. 

This morning I made coffees and breakfast for the family, and then worked from home. By early afternoon, the house batteries were fully charged, and water tank full of hot water. 

I've just had a shower, and I'm about to cook food. The washing machine, tumble dryer and dishwasher are all running. We'll have ample power to last through the night, and the batteries will fully charge tomorrow. 

Environment aside, solar and batteries just makes sense. They provide the ability to run appliances during the day when most convenient, and provide peace of mind with backup capabilities during a power cut. The fact that these systems also pay for themselves over time is just icing on the cake. 

If you're on the fence about solar+batteries, do consider backup capabilities. It's pretty magic.

（Original content refined by AI for language clarity.）

Chinese consumers are building a secondary market around beverage packaging. Coffee bags from brand collaborations now trade as collectibles and craft materials. What looks like an eco-trend is actually a sophisticated micro-economy with multiple business models.

**The Core Phenomenon**

Branded beverage packaging in China has become more valuable than the drinks themselves. Limited-edition collaborations between coffee chains and luxury brands or popular IP create artificial scarcity, transforming disposable materials into tradeable assets.

**Why It Works: Commercial Logic**

Social Currency Over Product When Luckin Coffee collaborates with luxury brands or popular franchises, the packaging becomes identity signaling. Consumers aren't buying caffeine—they're acquiring affordable status symbols.

The Lipstick Effect Economic uncertainty drives demand for ""affordable luxuries."" Low-cost beverages with premium branding offer psychological satisfaction without financial strain.

Design-Embedded Value Brands now architect packaging with ""creative surplus""—modular designs, quality materials, visual layering—anticipating post-purchase transformation and extended lifecycle.

**The Business Models**

Three distinct revenue streams have emerged:

Materials Trading: Collectors resell pristine packaging from popular collaborations. Geographic exclusives enable arbitrage opportunities across cities.

Enablement Tools: Third-party sellers produce modification accessories—protective sleeves, hardware kits, structural components—monetizing the gap between creative vision and execution capability.

Service Layer: Professional modification services and ""proxy acquisition"" (purchasing beverages specifically for packaging extraction) create labor-based income streams.

**Strategic Brand Positioning**

Different chains occupy distinct market niches:

Volume play: High collaboration frequency maintains constant material flow

Aesthetic premium: Design sophistication commands higher secondary values

Collectible tier: Luxury partnerships position packaging as merchandise rather than waste

Owned IP: Self-developed characters enable organic fan engagement beyond packaging

**Systemic Contradictions**

Environmental Impact: Preservation accessories often generate more waste than original packaging. Completionist behavior drives overconsumption.

Legal Ambiguity: Current tolerance for small-scale activity may not extend to scaled commercial operations, particularly with IP-protective luxury brands.

Value Inversion: The beverage increasingly functions as packaging delivery mechanism—product and container have reversed roles in the value hierarchy.

**The Larger Pattern**

This phenomenon demonstrates how brands can monetize ephemerality through strategic scarcity and aesthetic design. The packaging's ""long-tail social effect"" creates marketing value that extends far beyond point-of-sale.

Central insight: Premiums increasingly attach to participatory potential and identity expression rather than functional utility.",1,1771225979.0,SideHustlePaglu,0,0.67,False

I 35/M have been with my now wife 36/F for almost 2 years now. We've had our ups and downs throughout and our last fight resulted in us splitting up for a brief period. This split took place about a month before we got married 2 months ago. When we split I'd left and stayed elsewhere to give us both some space. The next day after giving us both time to cool off I bought her coffee and breakfast and took it to her in hoped that we could talk. She wasn't very warm or welcoming so I left it for her and went on my way assuming she needed more time. She denied any such feeling and said she didn't care if I was there or not. After that we had a rather normal conversation and even shared a few laughs talking about our animals. (We have chickens, ducks, dogs, a rabbit, goats and a pig). We ended the call on a pleasant note and I assumed that we were ok. She asked if I was coming home and I replied I was if she was ok with it. She said she was so I told her I'd be in after running a few errands. Later she told me she'd picked up a shift at work but her kids would be home and asked if I minded staying home with them. I said I didn't mind. Later she came back and said only her son would be coming home and her daughter would be staying with her mom. Still ok by me. I tried to surprise her and have lunch with her before she would normally be taking off. She said she was working in a different area and had to leave earlier so she could be on time and rushed me off the phone. I waited for a few hours and her son never showed up so I went back to the place I stayed the night before because I didn't want to be alone. I tried to call and let her know and to see how her night was going. She didn't answer but instead texted back immediately asking ""what's up?"" I replied ""nothing"" and she said ""ok"". I asked if she could give me a call when she had a chance and she stopped replying. An hour or so later son texted me asking if I knew where she was because she wasn't answering his calls. I told him she was working and not answering me either. I checked her location and she hadn't moved at all from one location for hours so I was curious as to why she would be ignoring calls and texts from me and her kid. I went to the location and saw her car parked at a trailer with one other car. It was obviously not a work place. My heart dropped knowing what this meant. I went back and tried to slept with no luck. I thought we were working on getting back to normal. The next day we spoke some and I eventually asked her about it. She flared with attitude and through it in my face that she'd slept with someone else. I wont say I was the best BF because I was far from it. I had no drive or little to no desire for sex and dk why. She has expressed that issue to me and I have tried to work on it here and there. I tried adjusting my diet, exercising, etc. with no success and just before this incident I'd made an appointment to see a specialist. Besides this I's been frustrated expressing my own issues that were being ignored which didn't help the situation. This appointment revealed that I had low T :( I felt worthless and ashamed. I couldn't do anything to satisfy my GF. She asked about being in an open relationship. I said I couldn't see myself doing it. She said I wouldn't be sharing her forever, just until I got myself together. I cant do it. I wanted to try and work on us with no distraction and she said she'd think about it. When I went home the next day (spent a total of 2 days away) we kissed and made up (no sex). She told me she felt bad about what she did and she didn't know why she did it. We cried and apologized but following that I still couldn't get through what had happened. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. My performance a work began to decline and I began having chest pain to the point of requiring 911 being called twice. I eventually began getting back to normal and felt like we were doing the same but on my birthday 3 days later she was very guarded of her phone. I could walk in seeing her obviously texting but if I approached she'd lock her screen and lay it face down on her chest, but not have the same reaction when watching a video or playing a game. The next day I couldn't resist and I went through her phone and found her texts with the guy from that night. I asked if they were still in contact and she said ""no"" so I asked her to block and delete him. She said absolutely to both. I proposed a few weeks later (terrible idea ik stop judging me) and I checked her phone again the next day and she hadn't blocked or deleted him. I confronted her about it and she said she unblocked and texted him because that night he said that we were going to get back together and get married and she wanted to show him he was right. I told her I couldn't trust her as long as it came to him. I'd asked for a few details of that night on a few occasions and it became obvious that she was lying. At some point I told her I couldn't move on until I had the truth. She eventually relented and we had a full on Q&A session where she allowed me to ask whatever I wanted to know in which I believe she was mostly honest but I do believe she was still dishonest about some things. but she never cut him off... Its been almost 2 months now and we've gotten married. She seemed to be taking things more serious with us. She screenshot the area of her contacts where his name would be to show me that he had been deleted. She's being more open about what she's doing on her phone and I felt like I could begin to try and trust a little... Until something just felt off all of a sudden. I checked her fb messenger, nothing. And then I checked her photos... She had a screenshot of 

Brian's contact before deleting it and sent me the screenshot after. I confronted her about it and she says it was an accident. Its no way it was an accident. What should I do? Will counseling help?",1,1771225599.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

* **L-theanine** promotes relaxation without drowsiness
* Together, they create focused energy without the jitters or crash

so if you are heading to the genesis invitational between 02/19 and 02/22 you probably already know that parking near riviera country club is a total nightmare. the streets are tight and the city shuts down most of the area to anyone without a resident permit so you really cannot just wing it.  
  
honestly you should look at Prked first. it is an app where you can rent driveways and garages from people who live right by the course. it is way cheaper than the official tournament lots and you get to skip those massive shuttle lines at the end of the day. it is just a short walk to the entrance and you do not have to sit in the gridlock on sunset boulevard.  
  
if you decide not to use Prked you will likely be sent to one of the remote lots with a shuttle. lot 1 is usually in downtown santa monica at the public structures and lot 2 is over at will rogers state beach. the beach lot is usually the most common spot but the shuttle ride up pch can take forever when traffic is heavy. paul revere middle school is lot 3 but it is usually reserved for specific pass holders or fills up by 7 am. there is also a bike valet at paul revere if you are local enough to ride.  
  
traffic patterns are a huge factor here. sunset boulevard and san vicente get completely choked starting around 7 am on 02/19 and 02/20 because of the work commute. on the weekend of 02/21 and 02/22 it is even worse with the tournament crowds and people going to the beach. if you are coming from the 405 give yourself at least an extra forty-five minutes just for that last couple of miles.  
  
definitely do not try to park in the residential hills or along capri drive because you will get towed immediately. the neighborhood is very protective and parking enforcement is everywhere during tournament week. if you use rideshare the drop-off is typically on san vicente but trying to get one after the final hole is a mess. i usually walk toward the palisades village to grab a coffee and wait for the surge pricing to drop before calling a car. if you want to try public transit the metro 602 or big blue bus 9 gets you close but they can be slow.

Supportive vibe – no judgment, no drama

Mostly for Bellandur / nearby areas so it’s easy to plan things

hey everyone if you are heading to the palm springs vintage market on 04/05 you should probably figure out a parking plan now because it gets pretty wild over at the cultural center area. it is peak season in april and those spots fill up before most people even finish their first coffee since everyone is out hunting for mid-century gems.  
  
i definitely recommend checking out Prked first since it lets you rent out driveways or private spots right next to the venue. it is usually way cheaper than trying to find a random paid lot and you get to skip the mess of people circling for street spots for twenty minutes. plus it is a short walk so you do not have to carry your vintage finds across town when it starts getting hot.  
  
the actual market is held in the main lot of the cultural center which means you basically cannot park where the event is actually happening. most people end up hunting for street parking along north calle encilia or east baristo road. just be super careful about where you leave your car because the city is pretty strict about residential permits and blocking driveways in those neighborhoods and they will ticket you fast. if you strike out there you can try looking around the mizell center area but check the signs because they have their own rules for their visitors and you do not want to get towed. traffic around farrell drive usually gets backed up by mid-morning so if you arrive after 9 am expect to spend a while just looking for a gap. honestly the best move is to get there right when it opens at 7 am if you want any chance at the easy street spots near the entrance and to beat the desert heat. bring some water too because even in early april that sun starts hitting hard and you might end up walking a few blocks if you do not find a spot right away.

I did North to South from 09. January ‘til 12 of February. I did not really have a tight budget but i’ll try to share some costs, prices and tips with y’all.
If you wanna skip the story, you gonna find the budget in the bottom.

1st Part: Hanoi
I arrived after 18hrs of flight (layovers included) Jet-lagging AF i couldn’t sleep a second on neither of the flights so i was done. I haven’t been this disoriented and tired since my raving phase ended in my mid twenties iykyk…

I tried to buy a local sim card at the airport, ofc i did not know that my phone was locked and i did not have a backup phone, so i accepted my fate and started walking out of the airport while trying to log in the wifi to order a grab. Did i mention i was tired af?
A Taxi driver grabbed me, i asked the price he said 320.000 (ca 10€) for a 40 minutes drive.
I said ok. He made me pay for the airport toll but i was so done, i did not care anymore so i just payed it. I still don’t remember how much he grabbed and at that point I couldn’t care less i just wanted to sleep. (Lesson learned, order a grab)

I arrived to MadMonkey (my first party Hostel).
I checked in, put my shit to the room and went down to the bar to grab a coffee. I just stood outside the Hostel for 30 minutes trying to breathe in the beautiful chaos (and smog) of the city. 

After talking with the crew and getting convince to join the “Drag queen” event i went for a little nap to my dorm. 4 bunkbeds a little trashed, a dude just shaved all his pubes and left it in the shower but hey, it’s part of the game.

I woke up (several times) about 2hrs later. And went down to the bar to make some new friends.
It did not take long, after 1 hrs i was partying with Aussies, Americans, Indians and a sweet couple from Scotland. And the show hasn’t even started yet.
Shout out to Cruze, and the local Worker who always lies about his name and nationality. They know how to make a party.

You might think a drag show is not for you. I tell you you are wrong. You could not be more wrong.
It was FUN with capital letters.

After getting proper fucked up, we went on the pub crawl. Good thing is Mad Monkey is 20meters away from beer street. Ngl I lasted only for 2 bars, then i hit a joint someone was offering and decided it is time, wait i’ll rephrase it: Now or never (or at least not on my own legs). I walked back to the hostel, crawled in my bed and got my well deserved sleep what was only interrupted 13 times that night from people getting in or leaving. 
100% worth it, what a night.

The next day i forced myself out of the bed around 11:00am. I felt surprisingly good. I ate a Bahn Mi (basically a baguette sandwich) it was kind of sweet but it was OK for like 1€. 
I wanted some soup to cure my hangover. I went to try the famous Pho soup. I was sweet again… but it did the job.
The hostel has a daily free walking tour through the City with some historical storytelling. And they took us to the big local market and to the train street.

When we got back i signed up for the Ha Giang loop what started on the next day (4+1day). The night before literally everyone was talking about that, there were guys who had done it 4 times already so it seemed like a must do. 

The hangover finally kicked in. Time for rest.

Hanoi budget:
Airport to Hostel Grab or taxi 270.000-320.000vnd (8-11€) everything over that is a scam.
Hostel 6€/night with breakfast incl.
Bahn Mi sandwich 30.000vnd (1€)
Pho soup 40-100.000vnd (1-3€)
Coffe on the street 30-80.000vnd (1-3€)
Pack of cigarettes 20-55.000vnd (1-2€)
Shoe cleaning on the street 30-100.000vnd (1-3€)
Beers in a deli 16.000vnd (0.55€)
Beers in bars or beerstreet 30-60.000vnd (1-2€)
Coctails and other drinks: i don’t remember i was fucked.

Ha Giang loop with easyrider 4+1 day (all included) through Mad Monkey: 7.000.000vnd (230€)

The next part is——> The Ha Giang loop

(2026) - A love Story That is both Beautiful and flawed, but delivers the Good","https://preview.redd.it/pd5w04gklsjg1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=86db9f080827b3438aa42d9ffac12e6d0fcea0dd

Annyeonghaseyo Everyone. Hope you all would be doing well in your respective lives. Today, for the next instalment in this review series, I'm going to review **'Can This Love Be Translated?' (2026**) - first time I'm reviewing a latest-released drama after re-subscribing my Netflix Plan. Actually, I wanted to cover the review of 'Coffee Prince' (2007), but since I couldn't complete it, I decided to review 'Can This love Be Translated?'. Hope you would enjoy today's review as well as the future contents this community will offer. So, without wasting much time, let's get started:

As I said earlier in my review of 'Secret Love', Love is a very strange thing, but it is also a thing most people, if not all, get confused of. Love represents even the most deepest things present in our heart, yet we still get confused that if it is the feeling of love, just like how difference in language creates confusion. This presentation of love as a language, a feeling that urges you to come out and express - is the core of 'Can This Love Be Translated?', which is both beautiful and flawed at times, but somehow it delivers the Good and continues a very good run of romantic K-dramas that continues to evolve in this era of New Age.

Released in 2026, **'Can This Love Be Translated?'** is a beautiful, experimental love-travel story that signifies the love as language, and it delivers this message perfectly. It's a perfect love story that will never leave you get bored, even if you feel pinched by its flaws. If we talk about the plot and storytelling, it's written beautifully because the concept is pretty much of high scale and there remains a chance that it would get crashed down completely from the word go; however, the makers did manage the plot excellently by combining the elements of love with a deep emotional depth and metaphors presented through the visuals and dialogues, which enhances the quality of this story. However, the mixing of genres (which might catch the rom-com fans off-guard) and the dragged pacing in the middle of this series is where the flaws get started, and cliches become visible. It would have been good if it would have been a 14 or say 15-episodes drama to flow out this story. Despite this, the story with a metaphorical plot and the themes, along with the performances of the cast, ensures the success of this drama. All in all, it's a good work done by makers, but honestly speaking, it could have been great due to its potential.

Moving to cast performances, the leads of this drama - **Kim Seon Ho and Go Youn-Jong** are the main highlight of this drama. The pairing of these two works perfectly with their sweet, slow-burn chemistry, that looked brilliantly when combined with the metaphorical and picturesque visuals. **Kim Seon-Ho, as Joo Ho-Jin**, gives a very strong performance that perfectly matches his own personality - subtle, layered, and quietly magnetic as the reserved language interpreter who slowly opens up. Considering his performances in other dramas, this role might have be the start for the makers to consider **Kim Seon-Ho** as a main lead, because he elevates every scene and matches the demand of the story beat-by-beat. **Go Youn-Jong** also gives an equally brilliant performance as **Cha Mu-Hee**. She displayed the emotions of her character perfectly and resoundingly - combined with vulnerability, fire, and quiet devastation in a way that feels painfully authentic. Their slow-burn chemistry is like a chef’s kiss — awkward, tender, and deeply satisfying. The Second ML, Sota Fukushi, is brilliant in his character of Hiro Kurosawa. He perfectly showcases the elegancy with humour of his character, and considering he's Japanese, this works even more perfectly. The supporting cast also gave good performance through their comedic humour.

The OST and the background music is brilliant. The Songs give you the vibes of love and romance, which elevates the scene. The cinematography is one of the best I've seen since Goblin and Something in the Rain - Visually Stunning and Picturesque, not letting you to go and making you feel alive. Considering this drama is a travelogue drama, this is the most striking part of this drama's success.

Overall, it's a **8/10** for me. It's a good drama to binge with your partners, although it could have great considering the story's rich potential, but the other good things of this drama are enough to compensate the flaws.

But you keep holding me at an arm’s length and I’m tired of trying to convince you to let your walls down for me. I’ve put myself out there countless times for you and yet you’ve still made no real attempts to get closer to me. You’ve never even asked for my phone number or a social account so we could communicate more, right? I tried asking for your number the first time we tried and you pretended not to hear me asking you (don’t think I forgot that either)….

*If it was anybody else then the answer would be obvious, right*? I can’t and won’t keep making exceptions or excuses for you. *Not this time*. And you can try to play slow all you want but I know everything you’ve done up to this point was calculated and manipulative. I just wish I understood your endgame in all of this…

Maybe you’re still upset that I left you for her but won’t say it? That was your fault alone and you know that too…*I would’ve picked you a thousand times if I knew you would do the same for me.*

But you don’t or rather *won’t* take that leap for me for whatever reason still to this day. Despite everything we’ve been through and all the love I’ve shown you over the years you continue to play with my emotions. It seemed like things were progressing too but it always feels that way before you pull back again. You know me well enough to know that I will not wait up for you but you really did a number on me this round. I don’t know if I can keep up the charades with you…

I lived life without you in it once and I never wanted to go through that again. But I know I will never find true love if I keep holding out for you which has brought me to this crossroads now. You insinuate I’m the other half of your heart and sometimes I believe you too. But I still want and require more from you, my child. *Show me that this is rea*l, show me that this what you truly want and I will stand by you until the end of time I swear it. *You are the one my soul is drawn to whether I like it or not;* I would need no others if I had you fully. But until you can commit to me or at least make an actual attempt to grow our relationship, I think it’s best that we take some time apart from each other again. I want you in my life but this only ends with more heartbreak if we continue down this path without making changes. 

I hope you took some time to reflect on our last encounter in the meantime too. I really do want to be a friend though and I feel like I’ve done my best but you keep dangling your love in front of me like it is mine for the taking when really that isn’t the case. I know you spent the rest of “lover’s day” alone too but it never had to be that way…*just some food for thought*. I hope your week goes well though, I’d be lying if I said I was looking forward to seeing you again…

*Love,*

Hey reddit,

A little about me:

I'm 32, 5'8"", Latino, from Hollywood. 

I'm a nerdy guy who loves going to pool bars, like music, video games and things along those lines. I'm a pretty easy going guy. I can be shy, but once we vibe, I can open up pretty easily. I am pretty ""go with the flow"" kind of guy. 

What I'm looking for: 

First and foremost, someone who wants to cuddle. I love hugs and physical touch. Someone who is receptive to that. I am looking for something a little more romantic, but platonic is okay too as long as that is communicated. Communication is very important to me. 

I can host and we can meet up for some coffee beforehand to see how we vibe and get along!

1r62h8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/handpickedberlin/comments/1r62h8b/berlin_or_cdu_wants_a_maglev_train_i_just_want_a/,Berlin (or CDU?) wants a maglev train. I just want a tram that gets green lights. (Issue: #186),"That’s one of the stories in today’s [Handpicked Berlin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#).

The CDU is pushing a magnetic levitation train between Tegel (Urban Tech Republic) and Spandau. One of the arguments: it won’t get stuck in traffic like a tram. So I was thinking, maybe totally naively: what if we just prioritise trams properly? And pedestrians. And bikes? I spend half my life waiting at red lights (looking at you, Reichpietschufer/Schöneberger Ufer at Potsdamer Platz).

But yeah, let’s try with a meglev feasibility study.

On the funding side, Berlin had a solid week:

* metiundo raised €40M (smart metering & energy data)
* Andercore €33.5M Series B (AI industrial trade)
* Circle Health €9M Seed (AI preventive care)
* hellomed €6M Seed (medication error prevention)

Outside Berlin:

* Hades Mining (Munich) €15M
* driveblocks (Munich) €3.5M
* conmeet (Borken) €1.3M

And yes, €0.99 espresso is coming. Cotti Coffee is expanding into Germany, eventually probably also in Berlin (it will be fun when they open at Kotti?). Independent cafés, stay strong. The hot takes are loading or maybe also not, because the influencers moved on?

Career-wise, I included a great (and very sober) response to the viral “AI will take all your jobs” essay that went viral last week. I’m increasingly in the camp of, yeah, it will change the way we work, but won't be replacing us. But I do feel it intensified my work: doing more, not less. Slightly terrifying.

Also: BASF is reportedly cutting 1,000+ jobs in Berlin. Not great.

New issue is out... Read for the full breakdown of funding, jobs, strikes and lawsuits (yes, you might get €5k from Meta): [https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us)

1r62gsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1r62gsx/advice_please/,Advice Please,"Hi Folks!

I currently have an DELONGHI DEDICA EC890 Machine with a Cheap Electric budan grinder worth 8k…

I hate the grinder as I can never get good coffee grind out of it.

Someone said get a manual grinder for same price, I will get far better value.

I also use bottomless portafilter so can also know the perfect one.

I require advice.

WHAT IS THE BEST GRINDER I CAN GET AT A STRICT BUDGET OF ₹8000

PLEASE SUGGEST

I USE BLUE TOKAI BEANS FOR ESPRESSO

EDIT :- Also I got no coffee roasters in my area so if I need to ditch a grinder and get pre ground then I will have to order online and Ig it may be stupid to get pre ground",1,1771224304.0,IndiaCoffee,5,1.0,False

1r62d25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r62d25,🇮🇳👀100 Ways to See India - Rohit Saran {part-1} Review,">Just wanted to share with y'all some cool stats about India from this cool coffee table book. I had seen this book @Delhi Book Fair in Jan, and ordered it later. (PadhegaIndia Sale)

>>I've shared 20 out of my fav from the 50 charts I've read so far. Just so you can get a feel of the book, and...sharing cool Indian facts is fun. 

>If you're a regular consumer of newspaper columns like Data Point (The Hindu) then this isn't for you. I wanted a compilation of sorts, so this book works well. There's also the site [Data for India](https://www.dataforindia.com/author/rukmini/) and [India in Pixels](https://x.com/indiainpixels?lang=en) - so if you like that sort of thing, this one's for you. 

>Some data points that really surprised me: 

1. Sheer linguistic diversity of India 
2. Baby boom of India over. 
3. North East Delhi being most dense popln wise...I'm from Delhi, but still thought Mumbai would be on top. 
4. India's Veg perception - this India in Pixels also showed, but still blows my mind. Today's [Devdutt Pattanaik's article](https://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2026/Feb/15/how-ahimsa-enables-untouchability) was also interesting on this. 
5. Justice system is broken af. 1 real live, 3 fake crimes is a good way to remember... 
6. Chicken>>>>>other animals. Wow. How? Westernization? Cheaper? NCC egg campaign??
7. Fewer Indians drink, but boy do they drink!! This I can attest to 😆
8. India's crime clock tick is just depressing af...that too of reported crimes. 
9. Delhi not crime capital...well sortof. 
10. More married women than men (seemed like a trick question at first)
11. Rs 1 lcr economy 💩!! Wow. 
12. How unemployment rate is calculated in India is simply a joke 🤣 
13. Trade as % GDP is amazing...what a turnaround in past 20 yrs...India is more globalised than China?! 
14. Didn't know Indians have won every Nobel Prize category! Only 7 other nations have done so, that too due to West's bias much of the time. (I knew we  had won Nobels, but in all categories! Never clicked in my mind) 
15. Last but not least, more Indians die for world peace than any other nations...😔 Graph 60 shows how UNPKF is funded by global North, sacrificed by global South. That's f*cked up. Never hear much about it either. Yes even WW1 and WW2 deaths included many Indians, but after 1948 too?! 

>>I'll post a part-2 after I finish the rest 50 charts. 

>Would love to know any fav fact of yours about India :)

There are quite a bit of thick branches in there. Would this actually compost with the rest of the items or would it just improve air circulation? 

Everyday i intend to throw table scrapes, coffee grounds, etc into the pile, also probably piss some more into it. Anything else i should he adding?",1,1771223930.0,composting,5,1.0,False
