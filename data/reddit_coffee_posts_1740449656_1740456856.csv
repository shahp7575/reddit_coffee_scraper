1ixm8xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Aggressive-Ring4689/comments/1ixm8xx/hola/,Hola!,"Introducing Myself to Reddit: My Journey in Creativity, Hustle, and Passion

Hey Reddit, what’s good? My name is Jaime Banda, and I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself to the community. I wear many hats—photographer, videographer, audio engineer, entrepreneur, podcast host, and, most importantly, a father and husband. My life has been a journey of self-teaching, perseverance, and turning my passions into reality.

From East Chicago to Entrepreneurship

I was born in Berlin, Germany, but East Chicago, Indiana, is my hometown. Growing up, I faced challenges that shaped me into who I am today. My mother was a single parent, working night jobs to support us, and my father wasn’t around for most of my early years. Eventually, I moved to Toledo, Ohio, to live with him, which was a turning point for me. Even though I didn’t always listen to him back then, I now realize the lessons he taught me—perseverance, initiative, and resilience—became my foundation.

I dropped out of high school as a junior and had my first child at 19 years old. Life came at me fast, but instead of letting it break me, I used it as fuel to push forward. Everything I know about photography, videography, and music production, I taught myself. I’ve always believed in figuring things out and making something from nothing, which is why I take so much pride in what I do today.

Building My Brand: Ori Studios Chicago

Fast forward to now, I own Ori Studios Chicago, where I offer photography, videography, and audio engineering services. Whether it’s recording sessions, music videos, event photography, or podcasts, my team and I bring visions to life. Our space features a photography cyclorama wall, professional audio recording setup, and even a vending machine (because you gotta keep the energy up!).

I also host Kush and Coffee Podcast, where I chop it up with talented artists, entrepreneurs, and creatives, bringing their stories to the world. Recently, I started a spin-off called Kush and Coffee Gaming, diving into the gaming scene with the same raw energy.

My Motivation: Family and Integrity

Beyond my work, my biggest priority is my family. I’ve been with my wife, Gracie, since 2008, and we’ve been married since 2017. Together, we’re raising five amazing kids. They are my biggest inspiration and the reason I hustle every day.

I also recently started a homestead because I believe in self-sufficiency and building something lasting for my family. At the end of the day, I want to leave behind a legacy—not just for my kids but for my community.

Why I’m Here on Reddit

I’m joining Reddit to connect with like-minded people, share my journey, and hopefully inspire others who are grinding to build something of their own. Whether you’re into music, photography, gaming, entrepreneurship, or just dope conversations, I’m here to chop it up.

I’m notoriously bad at flirting with other women or understanding that they are flirting with me (got a lot more practice with men).

Mostly just sharing here as experience for others who are as green as I am, and for others more well versed than I am to call out what we should be looking for as definite signs - 

1. She asked me out as a “friend” for coffee multiple times (this part seemed harmless)
2. She said she was bi more than twice (I thought she was just sharing)
3. She would always complement my fragrance and how I smelled (she would even close her eyes and inhale me…)
4. She stopped calling when I guess there was no sign on my side 
5. She’d share her sexcapades with guys and ask me if that would make me jealous (I’m married to a straight man, so I thought her angle was more if I missed dating)

Would these be truly signs though? 🤔

I never minded her dark sense of humor. It's pretty close to my own, after all. In fact, I'd even say it's one of the things I love most about her. Besides, I always get her back. One time, I swapped her coffee cup for a shoe, placing it on her desk and filling it with coffee when she wasn't looking. The look on her face when she saw it was priceless! That was revenge for when she hid my shoe laces.

Our little prank war has lasted the entire length of our marriage, going tit-for-tat with one another, though neither of us ever got mad. We'd both laugh and try to out do each other. These little pranks of ours have escalated in intensity and complexity for the last five years. It was little things at first, like her bleaching my all my shirts completely white, or like when I loosened the screws on her chair so it would fall apart when she sat down. It was never anything harmful, always being fun more than anything else. However, as the years went on, we got more creative.

One time, she rearranged my entire bedroom, swapping out the furniture and even painting the walls. That one really got me, but I made sure to get her back when I had someone dress up like me to go to our date and act like she was crazy when she didn't recognize him. That one was my best so far.

We have dates twice a week, always meeting in the same place. She loves to wear the cutest coats, preferring white to any other color. She really is a beautiful woman.

I've always loved fish and was an avid scuba diver before having children. I've recently been thinking about the possibility of starting to have fish again and maybe starting with one Betta fish. However, I have no clue where on earth to put the tank where it isn't at risk of breaking or getting tipped over. My main concerns are:

-We have a cat. She's old, but tries to eat anything and everything. We would have to get a covered tank to ensure she couldn't get to the fish.

-We have a high energy dog. He zooms through the house and regularly knocks our toddler down with his butt. I have some concerns that if we did a standing tank, he might knock it over on accident. 

-We have a toddler and a baby. This is the biggest concern. I don't want our children to hurt themselves or kill the fish by tipping a standing tank over. I've thought about getting a small tank for a counter or something, but we really don't have much available space. We use the kitchen counters for cooking, the bathroom counter probably wouldn't work, bookcase wouldn't be stable, the TV stand has a bunch of electronics so that won't work, the end tables and coffee table have glass centers and might not be able to support a tank, and I was reading the top of a refrigerator isn't a good idea (even though that's what my family did when we were kids 😬), etc. The only place that seems like it might work is my husband's office space where he has a long L shaped desk. But idk the weigh limit of the desk and our children could still technically reach up there. 

Is it just unrealistic to think I could have a small tank with a fish in our current situation? I'm not planning on going out and getting a tank and fish right away, but just think about options if we decide we do want to try having a fish in the near future. ",1,1740456150.0,Aquariums,0,1.0,False

We had a team meeting scheduled, and my boss asked me to “whip up some drinks” while he finished a call. I figured, how hard could it be? I’ve seen him use it a million times. Spoiler: >!very hard!<. I grabbed a pod from the little basket next to it… black packaging, looked fancy, seemed safe. Popped it in, hit what I thought was the espresso button, and waited. Except instead of coffee, this thick, brown sludge starts oozing out. At first, I thought, “Oh, maybe it’s just strong?” But then it kept coming… way too much, way too slow… and it smelled… sweet? Like, Hershey’s syrup sweet.

Turns out, I didn’t grab a coffee pod. I grabbed one of those hot chocolate pods his kid must’ve left behind from Take Your Kid to Work Day last week. But here’s where it gets worse: I panicked. The machine’s making this gurgling noise, chocolate’s pooling on the counter, and I think, “I’ll just hit stop.” Except I don’t know which button is stop, so I mash a bunch of them like I’m playing whack-a-mole. Big mistake. The thing starts hissing, then spraying hot chocolate everywhere… on me, the counter, the wall, even the ceiling somehow. It’s like a Willy Wonka disaster scene, and I’m the idiot Oompa Loompa.

By the time my boss walks in, I’m standing there, covered in sticky brown goo, holding a dripping mug, with his precious machine looking like it just survived a cocoa apocalypse. He doesn’t say anything at first… just stares, mouth open. Then he goes, “Did you… break it?” I mumble something about hot chocolate pods, and he starts laughing so hard he has to sit down. The rest of the team comes in, sees the mess, and now I’m the office legend - but not in a good way. Turns out the machine’s fine after a deep clean (which I had to do), but my boss keeps calling me “Choco-Lad” and someone stuck a Post-it on my desk that says “Barista of the Year.”

I’m still finding chocolate in random places - and I’ve learned my lesson: I’m sticking to water from now on.

TL;DR: TIFU by mistaking a hot chocolate pod for coffee, turning my boss’s fancy machine into a chocolate fountain, and becoming the office’s sticky laughingstock.",2,1740456133.0,tifu,0,0.56,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The week before that I consulted a new psychiatrist. I had been seeing my old psychiatrist for 15 years. Started around the same time I got my dog. I have been on an anti-depressant and an antipsychotic ever since. My new psychiatrist prescribed the same anti-depressant, but she's given me the option of taking a different antipsychotic. I haven't been feeling the same. I used to be on Abilify and now I am on Resperidone. On Abilify, I can sleep for 10 hours at a time. I usually need at least one cup of coffee per day to barely function. 

Right now, I am feeling a heartache and heartburn in my chest. I have barely any energy and I haven't been going to work. 

The question is what could be the cause of this. Is it my dog's passing? Is it the change in my medication? When should I start going back to work? How much time do I need?

i'm coming here because i need some insight from other black women. i'm a 24 year old single nurse and i am moving out of my home state near the end of this year. there are a few places i've narrowed down to and i plan on visiting all of them eventually this year. fortunately, i have a lot of time to think about this, but as the end of the year gets closer i have to start applying for a nursing license in the place(s) i'm interested in. right now i'm currently in the dilemma of deciding if i should lean towards dc or chicago. i've read countless reddit posts, forums, news articles, surveys, watched youtube videos, tiktoks, researched hospitals, etc. and have no clue which would be the best option for me. i've visited chicago before and loved it, so visiting dc is 100% next on my list.

**my priorities in a place:**

* can afford to live in a nice 1b 1 br with no roommate on a full time RN salary (budget depends on which city bc ik nursing pay:cost of living ratio is different in both cities)
* (i know this is very neighborhood dependent) overall safety especially as a single young woman who works night shift and will be living alone
* hospital systems that treat their nurses well
   * and lots of opportunities for nurses to change roles (non-bedside or something else) or obtain higher education
* easy to make new friends
* fun things to do (coffee, matcha, shopping, concerts, pottery, events, groups, parks, museums,  nature, clubs, painting, etc)
* diversity
* *public transportation!!! walkability!!!*
   * i do not want to bring my car to wherever i move to next and want to be 100% car free at least for the first year
   * i work night shift (7p-7a) and will probably work night shift at my next job and want to be able to safely get to and from work without regularly depending on uber/lyft if i get off early or something
   * ease going to the grocery store or shopping
* good and affordable (using this very loosely) hair braiders/natural hairstylists
* dating scene for a young black woman who is **monogamous** and potentially wants something serious in the next few years
   * i know everyone in every city says their city is the worst for dating lol

**issues i've seen with dc**:

* cost of living
* some people say its boring
* some people say the personalities there are pretentious
* some people say the dating is straight garbage
* allegedly very humid in the summer
* allegedly the crime
* metro closes early (issue for me working night shift)
* traffic if i bring a car

**issues i've seen with chicago**:

* segregation (very very big con for me)
* harsh and long winters (not a huge huge deal for me)
* some people say dc has better transit
* some people say the nursing pay sucks
* some people say its difficult to make friends there (girl idk)
* taxes
* traffic if i bring a car

those of you who live in either or have lived in both, which one would you lean towards? obviously a lot of the cons i've listed above are subjective experiences others have shared online and all i've been doing is reading. i would appreciate any and all advice!! <3 thank you boos",1,1740455513.0,blackladies,2,1.0,False

1ixlvww,https://www.reddit.com/r/audiobooks/comments/1ixlvww/the_original_short_story_stymir_is_wonderful/,"The original short story ""Stymir"" is wonderful","Styrmir was a word in Old Norse that means, roughly translated, ""one that causes storms"". 

	Or, at least, that was what I was always told. But I couldn't understand just why I was named that. Was it just for cool, metaphorical effect? Or was it hopes from my birth parents? Or did they just think it was a cool-quote unquote-bad name?

	Well, heck, who even were my parents, in that case? For sure, not any people with any sort of moral or ethical sympathy for their daughter. Because goodness, it was a terrible name to give the quietest kid in a Meteorology class where everyone knew the meaning behind it.

	""Hey, Styrmir! Where's the storm, eh?""

	""Hey, Styrmir! Join our group for the project! You'll bound to stir up a storm, and we'll all ace it!""

	""Hey, Styrmir!""

	Oh, for the sake of goodness shut up. I seriously regretted ever having a crush on the guy who invited me into the project. In the end, no storm ever turned up and we had to use the weather broadcast in the news to do our assignment. 

	They meant well, though. Despite the teasing remarks, the class was well-behaved, which was a high school dream that happened nearly never. 

	I glared out the window of the classroom. Last period of the day, Meteorology. It had been pretty much a free period, being the day we turned in the largest, final project of the year. There was still like a month left of school, but our teacher was merciful enough. 

	Merciful, or, in his words: ""I don't want to have to teach you anvil tops for another month, so this is going to be the last graded assignment of the year. Now, you're free to do whatever you want this class. Just don't commit anarchy or arson and you're fine.""

	As you probably expect, the class erupted into cheers when he gave that speech. 

	(An anvil top is the very top of a cumulonimbus cloud-those giant, tall storm clouds with a flat top that sometimes resemble an anvil. The idea was that Mr. Henry thought we were a bunch of idiots who were as high as an anvil top in his class from all the laughing. He?wasn't entirely wrong.)

	My own reflection glared back at me. With blue eyes and fiery red hair, I stood out in the crowd. You couldn't miss me even if you tried. Behind the glass pane, heavy rain and hail plummeted past, slamming into the ground as if they were trying to murder all insects. Being a meteorology student, it was impossible not to think about all the variables and factors that played into creating any type of storm.

	""Oh Styrmir!"" Kyle, the idiot who calls himself my friend and the one who'd dragged me into his project group, came and sat next to me. He had a stupid grin that suggested he had either a joke or a pickup line on his tongue, or he was about to yell at the top of his lungs five octaves above the average human pitch across the room to hear a response from a similarly crazy person he called a friend. Both scenarios had happened before, and somehow he still had good grades with our temperamental teacher. They were more like deranged dolphins than humans. ""Did you call that storm? Are you finally flexing your godly powers on us lowly humans, O Styrmir, goddess of storms and hot hairstyles?""

	""I will slap you."" Oh, and I would. I wasn't kidding. I had my hair down that day. I didn't even bother combing it, because I knew it would hail. Perks of being a meteorology student-I knew things that even the news couldn't pick up on. 

	I directed my glare at Kyle, who was struggling not to burst out laughing at his own remark, clutching his stomach. Good. Suffer. 

	""Oh nooo,"" Kyle exclaimed melodramatically. ""Save me! Ryker, help! The goddess of storms and hot hairstyles wants to slap me to oblivion and I don't know what to do-""

	I flicked him in the forehead.

	He yelled in exaggerated pain.

	The bell rang just then, and half the class whooped and skipped out, forgetting to open their umbrellas and getting pummeled, including Kyle. The relatively sensible ones grabbed their umbrellas first to avoid death by idiocy.

	I left the classroom last. It was a Friday, so thankfully I wouldn't be surrounded by mentally unhinged, deranged dolphins for the next two days. 

	I didn't have an umbrella, and I had never bothered with one. I'd walked through worse weather without it. And it helped with meteorology assignments, as I would often observe the downdrafts and updrafts, the cloud formations, the wind, and other factors.

	Meteorology simply came easily to me. I understood it in ways I couldn't explain. 

	Today felt?strange. I had correctly predicted this hailstorm yesterday, in class. I knew I would get extra credit for it, but something felt off about it today. There was something missing. I furrowed my brows as the hail plummeted me. They were decent sized, with a few larger than the others. 

	I tried to shrug it off as I kept walking. Leaving campus, my entire body soaked, I crossed the crosswalk with a group of students, then turned downtown. I had my afternoon bookstore shift on Fridays, and this was perhaps the worst time to not bring an umbrella, but I had a spare set of clothes in my backpack. It would be fine, I was sure.

	The bookstore was a cozy little place in downtown that was actually also a cafe. Or, at least, there was a bar. It was a unique bookstore in that sense. People could walk in and order a coffee or two (or, if you're me, four) and pick out something to read while you're on break, with a hot cup in your hands. The store didn't restrict the perusal of books for free inside the store. You could rent or buy the book to take it outside. It was also family-owned by the nicest couple in the city, and I considered them more like my parents than my actual parents-who I didn't even know.

	That?was a topic for another day, however.

	Passing by countless people, faces who I would never remember, and never know, the hail pummeling me and the wind blowing against me, as if trying to stop my progress, I was utterly silent. I never talked much outside of school and the bookstore. There wasn't much to talk about, nor were there people to talk to. 

	To the outside viewer, the change and transition between the loud, slightly chaotic Styrmir in the Meteorology classroom to the quiet, wordless Styrmir on the streets would be jarring. To me, it was simply second nature to be quiet surrounded by people. 

	Styrmir was an ironic name. It would suit Kyle better, or Mr. Henry, who was always enthusiastic about meteorology, and was actually quite a famous meteorologist in the community. But for reasons I could not fathom, my parents decided to give me that name when they embroidered it into a handkerchief and tucked it into a basket with me, before leaving it on the steps of a foster care center. 

	But as I entered the downtown metropolis, the feeling became unbearable. Something just didn't feel right. Perhaps it was the updraft. There shouldn't be quite an updraft? And where was the lightning? There should be lightning?

	My phone buzzed with an unfamiliar rhythm in a pocket on my backpack. It was pressed against my body, so I could feel any vibrations that came from the device. I frowned, and paused in the middle of the sidewalk. I never got messages. I didn't have anyone's phone number, and the only way I communicated was through email. (I know, I was old-schooled, deal with it.)

	I pushed open the door into a random cafe, and stood in a corner, ignoring the disgruntled looks from the barista and bartender as water dripped onto the tiled floor. This was just a temporary situation, as I pulled out my phone.

	There was a notification from a weather app. More specifically, a weather app created by me and a few others that year as a group project. There was a guy-Ryker, his name was-who was nerdy enough to know all about programming, so we made an advanced weather app for meteorologists. It was scarily accurate, and so now Mr. Henry made it mandatory for the rest of the class to have the app. But I didn't know it had a warning notification system?

	SEVERE UPDRAFT WARNING! HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS, BOYS AND GIRLS! IT'S ABOUT TO GET INTENSE! GET READYYYYY FOR THE BIGGEST LIGHTNING SHOW OF YOUR LIVES!

	?Right, next thing on to-do list for Monday: Punch Ryker in the face for making that notification.

	I put away my phone, and quickly exited the building, as the weights behind the glares of the bartenders were getting more intense. But I needed to think about the warning as I walked.

	Severe updraft?

	It was right. There was an unusual updraft. And the storm was missing a few lightnings. So where was the lightning-?

	I looked up.

	And that, my friends, has become the worst decision of my life.

There were a lot of problems in the relationship but a big issue was his unpredictable and erratic moods. I decided for that reason, I wasn’t comfortable doing a long drawn out conversation, (like breaking up or lunch or something.) 

Instead I met him outside his place and told him I had enjoyed our time together but because this was my first serious relationship, I was not prepared for all it would involve emotionally and time-wise. 

I am also starting medical school in the fall and told him that with that in mind, I hadn’t considered how premature it was to be entering into a relationship. 

He wanted me to come into his place and talk but I purposefully did this right before work so I could excuse myself. 

Now he is hounding me —and my mother and my older brother— saying it is unfair how I broke it off because he did not “get closure.” He wants me to come over or go out to discuss the relationship and what happened and what happens next. 

My brother said I should block and delete but my mom says she thinks it’s sweet and there’s no harm in just a coffee chat. 

I am unsure what my obligation is or what the right thing to do is. I don’t want to hurt his feelings any further but I also have less than zero desire to see him again or discuss this. 

What do I owe him at this point?

We were doing long distance for about a year and now have a lease together for 10 months. He’s had red flags in the past, things were good for awhile, but now I’m concerned again. 

TLDR: Bf won’t communicate with me about what I did to make him mad, and I am respecting his boundary by not prying. Am I an accomplice to my own manipulation?

So, Friday night we have a great time together, but in the morning I wake up to him rage cleaning the apartment. I keep the place pretty clean so I thought he was just mad that things weren’t as tidy as usual. He insisted nothing was wrong but couldn’t even look at me and started complaining about how he doesn’t like the new shower head I just bought. It was so tense that I got so much physical anxiety that I had to leave and get a coffee until he left. 

Later, he comes home from his workout in a great mood and acts like nothing happened earlier. We get groceries and things were normal for a few hours. I end up asking him, “hey this morning seemed like something was up, I wanted to check in if you wanted to talk about anything?” And he immediately gets mad, and admits that he was mad/annoyed with me earlier. 

He said  “I don’t know what to say, I don’t want to talk about it, it’ll just make things worse”. Then he went to bedroom and wouldn’t talk to me. There was so much tension again that I went back to my car and sat there for 2 hours before he left again. Few hours later he calls me while he’s with friends and is being overly nice and giving me all these compliments. It feels like he’s playing a game with me. 

Side note - I am extremely faithful, I cook, clean, take care of all his needs sexually, and I pay 50/50 for everything. My phone passcode is his birthday and I have nothing to hide. I am not going to pry so I’m giving him time, but it feels like it’s more about him wanting my anxiety to build as I sit here wondering what I did wrong.

1ixlpk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ixlpk6/he_was_just_curious/,He Was Just Curious,"When I was a kid, my mother and I were the only foreigners in our province. It was a quiet place, the kind where neighbors knew each other’s lives better than their own. And since my mother stood out—with her pale skin and strange accent—people were naturally curious about us.

Some neighbors would invite her over just to hear her talk. Others just watched from their windows, whispering behind cupped hands. But there was one man, Mang Ruben, who never spoke to us at all.

He just *stared*.

Every day, he stood by his rickety fence, his eyes following us wherever we went. His face was carved deep with wrinkles, his skin stretched thin over sharp bones, his lips always slightly parted like he had *almost* something to say. But he never did.

I told my mother he creeped me out. She only laughed.

""He’s just curious,"" she said. ""That’s all.""

Then one morning, over breakfast, she frowned at her coffee cup.

“I had the strangest dream last night,” she murmured.

I paused mid-bite. “What about?”

She hesitated, her fingers tapping against the ceramic. Then she let out a small, breathy laugh—forced.

""Mang Ruben.""

I felt a prickle at the back of my neck.

She stirred her coffee absently, staring into the dark swirl. “I dreamed I woke up in the middle of the night, but I couldn’t move. It was like my body wasn’t mine. Just… frozen.”

I stopped chewing.

She kept going, her voice quieter now. “He was in my room. Just *walking*. Not saying anything. His hands glided over my bookshelf, tracing the spines of my books. He picked up my perfume bottle and sniffed it, long and slow. He stared at himself in the mirror for so long, like he didn’t recognize his own face.”

A lump formed in my throat.

“Then he turned.”

She finally looked at me. Her fingers were white against her cup.

“He walked toward my bed. Bent over me. Close enough that I could *smell* him—like damp earth and something *old*. His lips moved like he was whispering, but I couldn’t hear a sound.”

I swallowed hard.

""And then?"" I asked.

She shook her head, as if snapping out of something. “Then I woke up.” She laughed, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Weird dream, huh?”

I nodded, though my stomach felt tight.

That afternoon, my mother didn’t leave the house. She locked the doors early. She checked the windows twice.

And that night, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard her pushing something heavy across the floor.

She was shoving her dresser in front of her bedroom door.

I didn’t ask why.

But at 3 AM, I woke up *suddenly*.

Something wasn’t right. The air felt *too still*.

And then I smelled it.

That damp, *buried* scent.

I held my breath.

And in the silence, I heard it.

Soft. Shuffling. Bare feet on the wooden floor.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

And then—slow. Uneven. *Breathing.*

From inside my mother’s room.

The next morning, before I could tell her, before I could even *ask* if she heard it too—

The news came.

Mang Ruben had died.

1ixln2y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixln2y,Same day chocolate loaf!,"First time making this and I’m so proud of it! 

Recipe, I just riffed off my regular plain loaf:

Bloomed 50g of Dutch process cocoa in 100g of brewed espresso or coffee, let that sit for a minute or 2 and then mixed it into 

310g warm water
150g active starter
45g honey
15g vanilla extract
660g bread flour 

I let this dough autolyse for almost 2 hours before adding 13g of salt which I dimpled in with wet hands (probably adding 10-15g of water) and immediately did first set of stretch and folds - this dough is quite dense at first so the stretch and folds definitely fight you back LOL

With the second stretch and fold I added in appx 120 g of chocolate chips (I would definitely add more next time, maybe 200g) and let it sit for 30 mins and did 2 more sets of s&f 30 mins apart for a total of 4 s&f all together. 

I let the dough bulk ferment all together for 9 hours on my counter, it’s pretty cold where I live so after about 4 hours I moved it to on top of my warm stove for the last 5 hours. 

Once proofed, I did an envelope fold and rolled it up like a burrito and did 20 minute bench rest. Did my final shaping and let it sit in the fridge for an hour while my oven preheated - I usually like to do a really long cold proof to develop flavour but I decided not to do that because I was a little skeptical about how a tangy chocolate loaf would be. 

I baked it in a covered Dutch oven at 475°F for 25 minutes and then dropped the temp down to 400°F for another 25. I would definitely bake for 10 mins longer next time as I think it’s slightly underdone but really no complaints. 

I’m planning on turning this into a baked French toast in a few days, if I don’t eat all of it by then!

Meron ipapadate saken yung friend ko na Korean. Pinakita muna nya saken. Classmate, friend nya. Yung guy pogi at matangkad(since matangkad djn ako. Kaya she mentioned this.) She said na the guy’s nice and they’ve been friends for 3 years. Super okay daw kase mabait at hindi babaero. 

Nakita ng ate ko yung FB nakaopen sa laptop ko since nag cr ako. Pagbalik ko nakatingin sya sa laptop ko. Sabi ko sinuggest ng friend ko idate ko yung friend nyang guy. Yung ate ko nag sparkle ang eyes at sinabi nyang pogi. Don ko lang sya nakita nagreact ng ganon. So dapat the following week kame magmeet non guy. So my friend can properly introduce us to each other. Umuwi lang ako sa hometown namen for 2 days pagbalik ko nameet na pala ng ate ko😀

Inaadd nya sa FB at mneet nya. Hindi sya kilala non guy. Pero nagmeet sila. So minessage nya. Tumawag friend ko at since kilala ng friend ko family ko, she said na yung nangyari. Na galit daw yung guy sa kapatid ko since ang mean daw at feeling matalino. Hindi alam non guy na kapatid ko sya non una nagmeet sila. Yung kapatid ko gumawa ng move. Lol. So sinabihan ko yun kapatid ko ng maayos na wag sya magagalit at I think hindi na nya dapat kausapin yun guy since galit na galit sakanya according to my friend ko at sinabi ko na sinasabi ko yon since kapatid ko sya. Ang ending ako sinigawan at binully ng ate ko. Sabi nya kaya daw ako gumaganon kase gusto ko daw yun guy. Ginaslight nya ako ng malala.

Ako na nga yung inagawan, ako pa sinisi. Ako na nga yung nagpakumbaba at concern kase nalaman ng barkada ng friend ko yung ginawa nya ako pa sinisi nya. Na in reality kame talaga dapat magmmeet, date non guy. Hindi ako makapaniwala na kapatid ko mismo gaganituhin ako. Alam ko ingitera sya at madalas ako at yung isa namen sister napapansin. 

So ginawa nya sa galit saken pumunta sya sa isa namen kapatid para siraan ako. Sinabi nya pati dun sa friend ng kapatid ko na naninira daw ako kase ako daw may gusto don sa guy. (My gosh. Malala talaga. Ako na yung inagawan ako pa yung masama.)

So pati sa parents namen siniraan nya ako. Di ko sya masagot kase nirerespeto ko sya bilang ate ko. Pero napakasama nya. Napahiya kase sya ng malala. Ewan ko ano ginawa nya don sa guy at sobra galit sakanya.

Ngayon hindi na kame nakapagdate non guy. A year passed na nakita nya ako at andon kapatid ko. Sinabi nya na ang ganda ko daw kahit na galing ako sa school na for sure pagod for the day. Sinabi nya to infront of my fam. Bigla umepal kapatid ko sabi Hindi man daw sya sinabihan maganda sya. Nagulat tuloy yung guy sakanya. Take note kasama namen parents namen at napadaan yung guy nasaktuhan nakita namen sya. Yung guy nagmmessage sya saken minsan kinakamusta ako at inaask out ako for coffee or lunch. Feel ko type nya ako pero dahil sa ate ko, hindi ko sya mapagbigyan kase pakiramdamdam ko isusumpa nya ako pag dnate at naging bf ko yung guy.

Grabe. May mga ganito palang kapatid. Akala ko dati ingit ingit lang dadating pa pala sa point na aagawan ka at sisiraan ka. Kaya ko nalaman siniraan nya ako dahil mismong sister namen isa nagsabi saken na non nagmeet sila with her friend pinagkwento daw ako. Kaya nweirduhan yung kapatid ko. Hindi daw sya makapaniwala sa sinasabi ng ate namen. Anywwy, yun lang naman guys and girls. Nakakasad. Hindi bale, madami pa din namen nagkakagusto saken. Sayang lang din kase since yun friend ko todo hype sa guy at baka sakali naging couple kame. Pero wag nalang dahil sa ate ko.

About a year into dating, this guy named Tom (not really named tom) kept sending messages to her. I made a lame joke one night about how her other boyfriend must know its not his night tonight and brushed it off. She explained that he was a friend from uni and they were close but never intimate. I told I really did not mind her having a friendly relationship with a guy and that was that.

About two years later we moved in together and now obviously we spent a lot more time together. As time went on I noticed that Tom would text her a lot more than I thought. Not quite daily but about 3-4 times a week. Well, curiosity got the best of me one night and I went on her phone while she was in the shower (we both are pretty open with our phones and I have never felt the need or want to snoop up until this point) and went through some of the recent conversations. Majority of it was pretty normal friendly conversation but mixed in would be the odd flirty compliment of how well she looked in a specific outfit or him wanting to see her and she would reply with thankful responses to the compliments and downplay the wanting to see her comments by saying ""we should grab a coffee sometime!"" I had a conversation with my SO about this an apologized for going through her phone but explained how this guy didn't really sit well with me and asked if there was anything between them. She reassured me that he was nothing to worry about and she would never do anything to hurt me. She actually went a step further and told me that she would stop responding to him.

Another thing to add... our sex life has taken a MAJOR fall from what it was. In the beginning of our relationship before we lived together we would have sex about 2-3 times a week. When we moved in together is when it first took a dive and went to about 3 times a month. About a year ago she went off birth control and since then we have only had sex once. I do understand that the hormonal change can dramatically impact sex drive but does that explain no sex at all?

Continuing with tom. Since she offered to stop engaging with him there has been no text pop ups that I've seen and all was okay. Now I really can't remember what triggered it but I felt the need to again take another look on her phone. Sure enough her and tom had continued to talk but on now on Messenger. Same kind of conversation from what I could tell but I felt worse about it now that there was no texting and just messenger. Now this is around the time were our sex life was going downhill and truthfully felt betrayed. Felt like this guy was filling a void I couldn't. I again confronted her about this and we had a long conversation and I went as far as asking her cut communication with him. She agreed that if that was going to make me feel comfortable then she would do that no problem.

Last paragraph I promise.. So I've been getting deeper and deeper into my own head honestly hoping to find something if anything that explains why our sex life has taken this turn. Again, today I went through my SO's stuff but this time her laptop. I don't know if she knows I know (mouthful) her password to it but I do. So I open it up and one of the tabs open is her email and in her email, in the deleted section ,which only shows this month of deleted emails, are two deleted snapchat notification from tom adding her as a friend. He added her once on the 10th and again on the 19th. All other snap notification emails are not deleted. I feel gutted to say the least and did not dig deeper although I plan on looking some more when I have the time alone.

1ixl79c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationTheory/comments/1ixl79c/no_npc_in_this_simulation/,No NPC in this Simulation,"
In the sprawling landscape of our shared reality, it's tempting to view others as mere background figures in the narrative of our own lives. The term ""Non-Playing Character"" (NPC) has seeped into modern parlance, a term borrowed from video games to describe those who seem passive, static, or peripheral. But what if there are no NPCs in this reality—no insignificant players, no filler roles, no empty shells? What if every single individual you encounter is as complex, vast, and essential as you are?

A Simulation of Infinite Complexity

Organic Simulism invites us to consider that we are living within a dream—an organic simulation crafted by the Source to explore every facet of existence. In this simulation, every being is a distinct thread of consciousness, gathering data, evolving, and contributing back to the collective. No one is ""just a background character."" Every interaction, no matter how fleeting, ripples across the web of interconnected lives.

The barista who hands you your coffee, the stranger you pass on the street, even the child who stubbornly refuses to nap—they each carry their own universe of experiences, dreams, and challenges. They are as integral to the simulation as you are, carrying data vital to the unfolding of the great story.

The Illusion of Simplicity

It’s easy to fall into the trap of seeing others as static characters, especially when their paths only briefly intersect with ours. This illusion stems from the limited perspective of our own narrative lens. We are protagonists in our own stories, but in truth, we are also secondary characters, mentors, or even fleeting passersby in countless other narratives.

The simulation is not linear. It is layered, fluid, and interconnected. Every consciousness is both an observer and a participant, a creator and a creation.

The Power of Acknowledgment

When we recognize that there are no NPCs in this simulation, our perspective shifts. Every encounter becomes an opportunity for connection, growth, and alignment.

Pause to See the Depth: Instead of dismissing someone as irrelevant to your story, pause and imagine the richness of their internal world. What challenges might they be facing? What joys are they carrying?

Act with Compassion: If every individual is a thread of the Source, every act of kindness is an offering to the collective. Treat others not as extras, but as essential contributors to the simulation's unfolding.

Seek the Lesson: Encounters—whether harmonious or challenging—carry lessons. Ask yourself, ""What is this moment teaching me? How am I contributing to their growth?""

The Simulation Evolves Through Us

Every life in this dream is a masterpiece in progress, a vital piece of the puzzle. Even those who appear stagnant or disconnected are participating in ways that may be invisible to the casual observer. No consciousness is wasted; no role is meaningless.

When we dismiss someone as an NPC, we close ourselves off to the vast complexity of existence. We miss the opportunity to see the simulation as it truly is: a tapestry of infinite, interwoven lives, each playing a unique and irreplaceable role.

The Invitation

Today, walk through the simulation with new eyes. See others not as objects in your story, but as subjects in their own. Engage with the world as though every interaction is sacred—because it is.

The dream belongs to all of us. And in this dream, there are no NPCs—only co-creators of the infinite, eternal now.

Let’s wake up to the depth of this shared reality and honor the roles we all play.

To cut a long story short, my ex best friend and I are no longer on speaking terms. 
After the welfare check she refused to speak with us until she reached out to the friend who was in the accident. She initially acted like nothing was wrong which sat weirdly with my other friend. 

She thought it would be a good idea try and get us all to talk things out... which against my better judgement, I agreed to. 
We arranged to meet at a coffee shop not far from ex besties place (for her convinience) but she was a no show. 
We later found out she had bailed to go and meet up with her ""soul mate"" she met on tinder the week before. 

That was it for me.

I’m using a bottomless portafilter with an IMS basket. I’ve had my machine for about four months now and I’ve used it pretty much daily if not multiple times a day and I’ve had no problems. I’ve used about a dozen different beans and I’ve been able to dial in each one with no problem whatsoever. I recently tried a new type of coffee bean that was extra dark roast that seemed appropriate for an espresso and tried it out at my normal grind size. It ended up being way too fine and caused a massive amount of back pressure in the porter filter. I tried two more times with a much coarser grind, but still had too much pressure in the portafilter. After cleaning the machine and flushing through a full tank of water, I started to have problems pulling shots of my usual beans. The beans I use every day now cause a very slow if not nonexistent flow at the normal grind size I used. I now have to grind much coarser to be able to pull a shot on any of the beans I’ve used in the past. It almost feels like the machine does not have as much pressure as it had in the past.

When I saw they were releasing a NA version last year I was stoked! I ordered two 6 packs and waited with great anticipation. I got them a few days later and poured one into a glass and immediately noticed how flat it was and than I tasted it and well, it was nothing like speedway. It was just plain bad. The best way to describe it was like week old black coffee. There was not depth, no velvety mouth feel that regular speedway has and maybe that is because there is no alcohol? I’m not entirely familiar with the NA brewing process so I chalked it up to that. I poured out the beer and I cracked another thinking maybe it was a bad batch but it was the same flat, black, week old Coffee. So, I don’t like it and I figure I’d try to get an exchange for the other 6 pack. I tried every avenue. social media, posts, email and they just ghosted me.

## Deep Dive into ​Materials: Choosing the Right One

The ⁤materials used in your camping cookware significantly impact its performance and suitability for different‍ types of camping.

*   **Stainless Steel:** A workhorse material, known for its durability and resistance to rusting. It can withstand high heat and is relatively easy to ⁢clean.⁢ Though,​ it doesn't conduct heat as evenly as aluminum, perhaps leading to hot spots. Stainless⁣ steel camping cookware amazon options are plentiful, offering⁤ a broad⁣ range of price points and styles.

*   **Aluminum:** Favored for its lightweight nature and excellent heat conductivity. It allows for quicker and more even cooking. Anodized aluminum is a step above, creating ​a⁣ hardened surface that resists scratches and ⁤corrosion. Though, unprotected aluminum can react with acidic foods, potentially affecting taste. When looking for lightweight camping⁣ cookware amazon, aluminum should be a⁣ primary consideration.

*   **Cast ‍Iron:** Beloved for its extraordinary‍ heat ⁢retention, making it ‌ideal for slow⁢ cooking, baking, ⁢and campfire cooking. A cast ​iron camping ⁢cookware amazon purchase, like a Dutch oven, can unlock a whole new realm of culinary possibilities in the outdoors. However,cast iron is heavy and requires proper ⁣seasoning and maintenance to prevent rusting.

*   **Non-Stick:** Offers the convenience of easy food release and quick⁢ cleanup.⁣ Modern non-stick coatings are generally safe,but it's essential to avoid overheating and using metal utensils that can scratch ⁢the surface. Nonstick camping cookware amazon options are available in both aluminum​ and stainless steel,⁤ offering a balance of ease of use and performance.

*   **Titanium:** The ultimate ⁤choice for weight-conscious backpackers. Titanium is incredibly strong ⁤and lightweight, but it's also the most expensive option. It conducts heat⁣ poorly, so cooking can​ be tricky, requiring careful temperature control. This is a niche option, but‌ essential for hardcore backpackers looking to shave every ounce.[[Explore Top Rated amazon camping cookware on Amazon.]](https://wabashop.com/camping-cookware/?kw=amazon camping cookware)

*   **Dutch Oven:** A versatile cooking pot made from cast iron, perfect for‌ baking bread, roasting meats, and simmering stews over a campfire. A dutch oven camping amazon search will yield numerous options,ranging in size and ⁤features.*   **Camping Kettle:** for‍ boiling⁢ water for coffee, tea, or rehydrating dehydrated meals.Look for ‌a ‍lightweight⁤ kettle with a secure lid and heat-resistant handle.
*   **Grill ‌Pan or Griddle:** To provide more cooking adaptability.
*   **Utensils:** ⁣Choose durable and lightweight⁤ utensils ‍made from stainless steel, wood, or heat-resistant plastic.
*   **Cutting Board:** A small, foldable cutting ⁢board makes food prep much easier.
*  ‌⁢ **Cleaning supplies:** Pack ⁣a biodegradable soap, sponge, and scraper ⁢for⁢ cleaning your cookware.
*   **Camping Stove:** Without the stove, most cookware becomes useless. Make sure you⁣ have a reliable stove to ⁤cook on as well.

Another example is I met a mother for coffee last week and all went well (care.com) then she said I’ll let you know in a week and I gave her my reference…. A week passes and she texted me last night hi I’m going to request a background check through care.com looking forward to meeting  - P.S. im ALREADY checked on care.com and I just hearted the message…. I woke up this morning and approved the request for it… until mid day I was searching again on care.com and this woman posted the listing again… from that point I just felt something was so off and so I contacted care.com and had them cancel the report because I’m so sorry, but why do you want to look at my personal information and you’re still looking for people know that’s not the way it works. What’s so fishy is that during the interview she didn’t mention exactly when she needed help. And then to top it off when I told her that because she was looking for 40 hours a week originally she said oh can you please let me know if you’re available for Thursday and one day of the weekend? like what the fuck…..

How long would these jars last in the fridge? Don't care about taste, only about caffeine content and saftey (like no mold, minimal bacteria, etc).

Also if anyone can confirm how long a peanut butter sandwich with honey would last in the firdge, that would be amazing too - I'm seeing 2-3 days in the fridge, 24hrs outside of the fridge, and a month or so in the freezer? If the freezer thing is legit, could i make my own uncrustables and thaw them overnight in the firdge?

While others snore and dream away
We're up and working
night’s our day!

No morning traffic, no long queues,
Just me, the stars, and worn-out shoes.

The coffee’s strong, the lights are dim,
The vending machine’s looking grim.
But hey, no bosses breathing near,
Just Terry snoring, THE engineer.

Emails slow, no calls come through,
No meetings filled with ""Let’s review!""
No Karen’s drama, Bob’s new plan
Just blessed silence (when I can).

Come sunrise, as the world awakes,
I’ll crawl to bed
my back now aches.
But nightshift’s perks? Oh, there are many,
Like shopping trips when shops aren’t heavy!

The pay is better (least they say),
And sleep’s a thing for another day.
So here’s to nightshift, weird and wild
A vampire’s dream, a bat’s own child!

TLDR: I am respecting my bfs boundary to not communicate with me about what I did to make him mad. Am I allowing him to manipulate me?

So, Friday night we have a great time together, but in the morning I wake up to him rage cleaning the apartment. I keep the place pretty clean so I thought he was just mad that things weren’t as tidy as usual. He insisted nothing was wrong but couldn’t even look at me and started complaining about how he doesn’t like the new shower head I just bought. It was so tense that I got so much physical anxiety that I had to leave and get a coffee until he left. 

Later, he comes home from his workout in a great mood and acts like nothing happened earlier. We get groceries and things were normal for a few hours. I end up asking him, “hey this morning seemed like something was up, I wanted to check in if you wanted to talk about anything?” And he immediately gets mad, and admits that he was mad/annoyed with me earlier. 

He said  “I don’t know what to say, I don’t want to talk about it, it’ll just make things worse”. Then he went to bedroom and wouldn’t talk to me. There was so much tension again that I went back to my car and sat there for 2 hours before he left again. Few hours later he calls me while he’s with friends and is being overly nice and giving me all these compliments. It feels like he’s playing a game with me. 

Side note - I am extremely faithful, I cook, clean, take care of all his needs sexually, and I pay 50/50 for everything. My phone passcode is his birthday and I have nothing to hide. I am not going to pry so I’m giving him time, but it feels like it’s more about him wanting my anxiety to build as I sit here wondering what I did wrong.

I want someone who doesn’t mind my clinginess, who thinks it’s endearing when I hold on just a little longer or steal their hoodie just because it smells like them. I want someone who gets my dry humor, my sarcastic jokes, and the weird, random thoughts I blurt out. I want to be able to rant about my day, my dreams, and my overthinking, and know that they’ll actually listen. I want to be their safe space, just like I want them to be mine.

I want to walk around town holding hands, not because I need to, but because I just like feeling close. I want someone who enjoys quiet moments as much as deep conversations, someone who understands that sometimes I’m an introvert, sometimes I’m an ambivert, and sometimes I just need to recharge alone. I want to go on spontaneous adventures—maybe a late-night drive, maybe just a random trip to the grocery store where we end up buying too many snacks. I want to argue over dinner plans and then laugh about how indecisive we both are.

I want to write them notes just because, to surprise them with thoughtful little things that show I’m paying attention. I want to make them laugh when they’re having a bad day, to be the person they turn to when they need comfort. I want them to see all my awkward, goofy sides—the clingy, the quiet, the overthinking, the funny, the affectionate—and still want me just the same.

Check these out:

1. **Bypass Geo-Restrictions** 🌍 Want to watch shows and movies from other countries? With TurisVPN, you can virtually “be” anywhere and unlock content that’s otherwise blocked in your region.
2. **Avoid Bandwidth Throttling** 📉 Ever notice your internet speed slowing down while streaming or gaming? Some ISPs throttle your speed. TurisVPN hides your activity, helping you keep that sweet speed, even during peak hours.
3. **Secure Public Wi-Fi Connections** 🔐 Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but it’s also risky. TurisVPN encrypts your connection, so hackers can’t easily snoop on your data when you're at a coffee shop or airport.
4. **Access Better Deals** 💸 Yep, some online stores and airlines offer different prices based on your location. TurisVPN lets you “shop” from a different country to score the best deals!
5. **Enhanced Privacy** 🔒 We all know companies track our data online, but with TurisVPN, you can make it way harder for websites to track your browsing habits, keeping your personal info more private.

So, yeah, there’s way more to VPNs than just being “secure.” Whether you’re streaming, shopping, or just browsing, they’re super useful. If you haven’t tried one yet, now’s the time! ✨",1,1740452472.0,TurisVPN,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\

    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It has a little coffee/tea station in the main lobby with a variety of bagged tea options, but I'm an filthy tea snob who prefers loose leaf Chinese tea. So here are my reviews of the ones I've tried so far. And if I insult one of your favourite teas, don't be offended, taste is all subjective. 

Bigelow lemon & ginger:
This tastes like neither lemon, nor ginger. The smell is weird too I kept rechecking the label to make sure I hadn't actually grabbed some sort of cinnamon flavoured tea. The taste is extremely mild. But what I do get of it is some sort of Christmas flavoured tea? Very weird. Do not recommend. 

Red rose orange pekoe: 
This tastes just like the tea my mom drank constantly when I was a kid. Probably because it's the exact one she used to buy until one day they changed the tea bag material. She hated it and never bought them again. I think she switched to tetley. I don't know what to say about it. I took a sip and thought, yep that's tea I guess. It's begging for a splash of milk, but alas, I have none. My mom always drank it with a very big splash of milk. 

Higgins and Burke orange pekoe: 
This one smells pretty good. As I sit here waiting for it to brew I read the ingredients on a packet of coffee whitener. Oh my god why does this even exist. No thanks. I won't be whitening anything today. Anyways back to the tea. Good smell, nice taste. I wish it was stronger. This one is decent for a bagged tea. I would add a splash of milk if it was available to me, but the only thing I have in my room is this whitener...... 

Bigelow Cinnamon Apple herbal tea: 
Why does this taste exactly the same as the lemon ginger? It smells a bit better, more apple scented, but the taste is the same. I was so confused that I dug the older tea bag out of the trash to make sure I hadn't just made the wrong tea before. It still said lemon ginger..... either way they both suck. 

Mrs. Parker orange pekoe: 
This one isn't as weak as the last two black teas. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. 

At this point I discovered a tea shop up the road from my hotel. They have over 150 teas from various countries and I'm thoroughly pleased. I might make a separate post about them because I'm very intrigued by their to go basket strainers for loose leaf teas. I have a cup of moonlight white, but I wish I'd made this discovery 2 days ago......

I'm 24f and my parents are looking for alliances. 

I've been in a home where since childhood there were too many fights and violence at home so I was very much scared about marriage. In a world where we often hear about relationships falling apart, I’d love to hear from those who are still happily married after years (or even decades) together.

How long have you been together?
What keeps your love strong? What small (or big) things make you choose your partner every single day? Are there any habits, mindsets, or moments that have made all the difference over time?

Whether it’s laughter, patience, shared values, or just the way they make your coffee every morning—I’d love to hear your stories. Let’s spread some positivity and wisdom!

1ixks69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ixks69/open_source_script_to_create_targeted_wordlists/,Open Source Script to Create Targeted Wordlists for Security Testing,"I recently developed a free, open source script that builds password cracking lists based on words found on a business’s website.

Many businesses use words—like parts of phone numbers, addresses, or other common terms—that might also appear in their passwords. ([View Screen Recording](https://substack.com/@darkmarc/note/c-95997810))

**How It Works:**

* **Website Crawling:** The script starts at a specified URL and recursively crawls internal pages up to a depth you choose.
* **Text Extraction:** It gathers all the words from the website. It even handles phone numbers specially by breaking them into components (area code, prefix, and line number) because these fragments are often used in passwords.
* **Stop Words Filtering (Optional):** It removes common words (using a default list or one you supply) to focus on more relevant terms.
* **Wordlist Generation:** The script sorts the words by frequency and lets you choose how many top words to include—or include them all. The final wordlist is saved as ""wordlist.txt"", ready for use with security testing tools like Hashcat.

**Example:**

A coffee shop’s WiFi password might be ""Coffee2025"" (using ""coffee"" from their site and the current year), ""123MainStreet"" (their address), or ""515-222-1234"" (their phone number). Using words relevant to the business increases the chance of matching actual passwords.

The generated list would be used with password cracking tools like Hashcat to crack the password. I wrote a [full guide to Hashcat here](https://darkmarc.substack.com/p/wifi-password-cracking-with-hashcat) for anyone who wants to learn more.

This script is intended for ethical security testing and research. Use it only on websites where you have permission to test or as part of an authorized security audit. Its purpose is to help identify weak password choices and improve security, not for illegal access.

If you're interested in using or tweaking the script for legitimate purposes, feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions!

Nobody wants to test for ADHD and it even runs in my family and autism runs I'm my family too. I have autism, but I think I also have ADHD. I don't have instant Cafe Bustelo coffee and coffee the normal way takes 15 minutes but it feels like hours. If I don't have a Monster or coffee, I can't relax. And gym helps, but sometimes the gym is very full. If I had instant coffee, I can mix coffee with water and chug. I can't even get the non-stimulant Strattera which is stronger than Caffeine yet safer. Nobody believes I have ADHD because the autism masks it until I get angry because assholes provoke me. I'm generally try to be peaceful, but society is asshole gangs only pick on Hispanic and not other races. I need Strattera, Modafinil, Armodafinil, Adipex, and instant coffee Cafe Bustelo. I don't want to ""get high"". I want to get normal. If I do ever want a small buzz, I can just chug Kratom because it's natural. Nobody cares that I have ADHD because I'm Hispanic and the autism masks ADHD sometimes until I explode. The doctor always says, ""try coffee. Two cups."". And if I bring a soda with me, he says, ""Drink Club Soda or Seltzer."". I'm NOT A FUCKING ASSHOLE! If I want a soda sometimes, I don't see the harm. He says, ""You're fat and need to diet."" He's a mental doctor not a physical doctor. The only good part is we agree exercise is good. I do plenty of exercise and eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. If I want to eat an occasional junk food, that's not bad. I like Zebra Cakes, Oranges, Pumpkin Pie, Frosted Flakes with milk, Recess cups, Chicken Wings and fries, Cheeseburgers, sometimes soda. The physical Dr says I'm healthy except for high cholesterol. I tried my best to lower it and lost weight but I was depressed. But then I got put on cholesterol meds. The good doctor was the one who noticed I was depressed and upped the antidepressant dose. Maybe he will give Strattera. But the bad psychiatrist thinks I can't even get Strattera because I, ""Used to try weed"". Kratom helps ADHD and depression more than weed. Weed actually makes ADHD worse. I do Propylhexedrine HCl like once or twice a week. The rest of the time, it's coffee. I need Strattera. No one thinks I got buff so far. They think I'm weak and scrawny and shrimp. I will try to get a job. I will continue to work out. The only PED I tried was Cardarine back in April for a few days. I didn't even need the Cardarine. But I will give it at least another year on my own. If I don't get swole as fuck, I might consider SARMs again. I need anti-ADHD meds. I could LITERALLY SETTLE FOR STRATTERA. Because they say EVEN STRATTERA is better than coffee. If I really wanted to get high, I would just smoke weed everyday. But I don't care about a fucking high. I just want to be normal. So hopefully, I can get Strattera, Modafinil, Armodafinil, and Adipex. My brother used to take Adderall and it calmed him down. I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO FUCKING ADDERALL OR RITALIN OR VYVANSE. I just need something to normalize me. And I know how it works. Eventually you get used to the meds and even if it feels like it's not working, it's still working in the background. And then when you stop taking it for a week or two and don't even drink coffee, you notice your life is a disaster, then you're back to taking it. I don't care if the pill of the future is called Gaylium and it doesn't feel like anything but normal and it turns you gay. I rather be gay and normal than ADHD and straight.

We have 950 sq ft, 2 bed 1 bath in a HCOL city. 15 min car commute for both myself and spouse 2x/week, walk to the park and coffee shop and daycare. One large dog, one wild toddler (hope to have a second kid), no pantry or modern-style fridge, doing laundry requires walking outside to the garage, certainly no office space for the 3x/week we WFH. Can't even poop without the other WFH spouse smelling it 😆 a playroom or guest room would be nice, too.

I'm very neat and have always worked hard to limit clutter, so we have very little extra stuff. Spouse is on the messier side but does do his part to meet me in the middle. We hope to have a second kid soon.

Now we're moving to another similarly HCOL city and trying to decide how to prioritize house size. We both want more space badly, but we also don't want to be in a fully car-dependent suburb. However, this is proving challenging because the good school districts with homes under $1M almost all seem to be in...fully car-dependent suburbs! lol. Maybe the suburbs aren't so bad? 20 min commute and we could compromise by finding a suburban house that's walkable to a trail system, bikable to the library, etc. but I have this nagging fear that more house will just mean more housework. Or that the burbs will be lonely or soul-sucking. Is that true? Or were you pleasantly surprised by the burbs?

May 5, 2022 I made the beautiful mistake of taking 2 wild baby (quarter sized) softshell turtles that my coworker rescued from being ran over.

Today my husband came for lunch and called me frantically telling me something was wrong w the male Taco and that his wang had been torn off. I’m usually the caretaker and told him not to worry, i would be home soon. He went back to work. he Got out early, to race home and check on the baby. When he called me he said taco was dead. It didn’t really hit me until i got home and his eyes were cloudy and he wasn’t his usual active 
it looks like his penis prolapsed and while swimming around nervously he got it stuck on a sharp side of a giant piece of driftwood i had in the tank.

1ixklhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HashCracking/comments/1ixklhe/i_built_an_open_source_script_that_crawls_a/,I Built an Open Source Script That Crawls a Website to Build Targeted Wordlists for Password Cracking,"I recently put together a script that might be useful for those working on password list generation.

The idea behind it is simple: many businesses include words in their websites (like parts of phone numbers, addresses, or other common terms associated with the business) that can be used to build a targeted password list.

**What the Script Does:**

* Crawls a Website: Starts at a given URL and recursively crawls internal pages, up to a user-specified depth.
* Extracts Text: Extracts all words from the site, with special handling for phone numbers. It breaks down phone numbers into components (area code, prefix, line number) since these fragments are often used in password cracking.
* Filters Stop Words (Optional): Removes common stop words (or custom ones you provide) to focus on more relevant data.
* Generates a Ready-to-Use Wordlist: Sorts the words by frequency and lets you choose how many of the top words to include (or include all). The final wordlist is saved as ""wordlist.txt"", ready for use with tools like Hashcat.

**For example:**  
A coffee shop's WiFi password might be ""Coffee2025"" (using ""coffee"", a commonly used word on their site, and the current year), or ""123MainStreet"" (their address), or even ""515-222-1234"" (their phone number). Including words relevant to the company in your list increases the likelihood of matching actual passwords.

I built this script because I noticed that many businesses inadvertently use specific terms and number fragments throughout their sites—and these are often mirrored in their password choices. If you're interested in using or tweaking the script, feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts.

Using Mochi. Rotating injection sites (arm, L/R side of stomach, L/R thigh). I drink 80-128 ounces of water a day, take pepcid daily for indigestion (prior to glp-1). Prioritizing protein but not very hungry.

**First 4 Weeks:** .25mg each week. Minimal symptoms but feel it working. No large drop in weight (4-6 pounds, fluctuating).

**Week 5:** Had not received a refill yet, so I injected what was left of my vial (enough to equal 15 mg dose), not sure why, seemed like a good idea at the time. ***Bad idea? Did this affect my body's tolerance?***

**Week 6:** Provider moved me up to .44mg.  
**Thu 2/6.** first dose. A little nausea, was fine.  
**Tue 2/11** 5 days later, wake up with frequent diarrhea, but feel OK (the day prior I had fairlife 30g P shake, grilled chicken w/ baked potato for lunch and dinner. I did have a $1 pack of nerds gummy clusters). Lasts until Sat 2/15, even w/ taking immodium. Having yucky burps which I think may be the sulfur burps people mention?

**Week 7: Sun 2/16** \- delayed injection 3 days to match w/ days off. Eat two beef franks (no bun) for dinner at 8p. Injection closer to 10pm.  
**Mon 2/17** 4am wake up w/ indigestion/heartburn at 4am. Take tums and pepto pills. 6am I vomit undigested dinner, continue to vomit until 930am until nothing left, diarrhea is back. I lay down til 2p, drink 4-8oz water, more vomiting, switch to ice chips. I go to urgent care and am given zofran, no more vomiting for the night  
**Tues 2/18.** Vomit/diarrhea in AM, take zofran and its gone, and those symptoms go away for good. But not hungry, barely eat, fearfully not drinking much rest of the week. Overall just weak from all the things.  
**Sat 2/22** I realized that the feeling of discomfort I had was bc I hadn't gone in days.

**Week 8 Sun 2/23** still constipated, took meds for it, are doing a little something but not much. ***Did not want to take my dose last night  to make that worse or potentially have a repeat of vomiting when I have work Monday-Thurs.***  
***Mon 2/24*** we are back to being regular thank god, not very hungry though (water, 8 oz coffee, ham, sweet potatoes, serving of cottage cheese, fiber supp).

I work in the ER, stomach flu is rampant, so my mochi provider and urgent care were thinking based on the symptoms starting in between doses, it may not be GLP-1 related. Encouraged to take next dose as long as symptoms subside. ***Anyone have a similar experience to mine with GLP-1? I'm not sure if I think this is stomach flu or big wave of side effects.***

***If you have experienced any of this, do you think I should consider going back down to previous dose for a few more weeks, or try an in between, like .35mg? Or would it be better to split the dose as my body adjusts? I've seen tips on zofran pre-injection, sleep, and zofran in AM, has this or something like it worked for you?

I am planning to buy a machine (budget up to $1500) within the next 6 months and had my mind set on the barista touch impress as on paper it seems to be perfect for me: I don’t want to have to deal with weighing out my coffee beans for every single drink, it has an upgraded grinder compared to the older brevilles, and it has settings for steaming different milk types. I also like the aesthetic of the machine. But after spending a few hours on here reading the reviews of the machine I am wondering if it would be worth it… 

So I guess my question is, to those who have this machine, do you like it? Does it make good espresso consistently? I don’t mind having to dial in with each new bag of beans, but having to change settings each time I pull a shot would be frustrating. I’m looking for something I can just wake up and use and produce a drink that tastes like I bought it at a coffee shop. 

Is there anything that’s a comparable price that has a built in grinder but has better reviews? I like the idea of being able to put my beans atop and have the machine deal with (most of) the rest. Or if I got something like the bambino plus + a grinder, is there a grinder out there that will dose for you? I’m really just trying to avoid having to weigh out my beans with a scale lol

A few YouTube videos ago I decided on getting some new basic accessories (bottomless portafilter, new Eureka mignon grinder, scale and wdt tool).

This is my third attempt brewing using the new goods, 18g of beans, 36g of coffee but at 44 seconds. How does this look?

Think I’ll try to grind the beans a little less fine and getting fresher beans locally after this one is done, but otherwise I think it tasted pretty good compared to what I drank in the past!

I've just completed build on a new PC, everything new (as in new drives, new windows install, etc).  It has an excessively long boot time.  6 minutes to POST screen, another 3:40 to windows login.  that's not an exaggeration, I timed it.  So clearly I need some help.  for those who complain about 45 second boot times....

Rig goes like this.

* ASUS Tuf B850M wifi board.
* AMD 7950x3d cpu.
* Nvidia 4060 GPU
* Samsung 870 EVO 2tb SSD (boot)
* Seagate Barracuda 8tb drive (storage)
* Kingston Fury Beast 32gb x 2 DDR5 RAM
* EVGA 850 B5 80+ PSU
* Coolermaster 360 AIO
* Coolermaster Mobius 120 fans
* Samsung 49"" monitor (this was reused)

  
Built from scratch.  SSD formatted fresh, with a clean Win10 install.  BIOS and Windows both set to fast boot.  practically no apps loaded on boot.  fresh installs on apps, nothing copied from prior installs.  going to make a pot of coffee while the machine boots seems excessive... so any help is appreciated.  thanks everyone!

From everything I was told at the hospital it's supposed to be just moderately painful experience with a few unpleasant side effects, but nothing too crazy... This was definitely not the case! The doctor in fast track ended up performing the lumbar puncture and it was incredibly painful. He had to stick me twice with the needle before being successful and did not use any freezing. It was so painful the first time he went in I almost passed out from the pain and it was like a pain I've never felt before. Afterwards he told us it would be about an hour before we had results and we could go get a coffee if we wanted to leave for a bit. I had to beg for a bed just so I had a place to lay down for a bit I was in so much discomfort. It seemed like this doctor had no idea what he was doing. 

Fast forward to today and whenever I'm standing upright I am getting a swelling headache that only goes away if I lay down. My entire lower body is incredibly sore from the puncture site down and I'm not sure how much longer I can tolerate the headache.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

We had a ton in common and the conversation kept going and going. We made each other laugh a lot. He paid for our coffees and some snacks from the cafe. He mentioned an event we could go to. At the end, we hugged goodbye. 

After we parted ways, he texted me within MINUTES to follow up on something from our conversation earlier 😭 And then we just kept texting the rest of the night! When I got home I sent him a selfie and he was really enthusiastic and told me I was super cute. I was really excited about the connection. 

The next day we texted again throughout the day and had good conversation. But then, in the evening, suddenly, he stopped replying in the middle of the convo. I figured he had to get ready for bed. And, to be fair, the night before, I was the one to stop the convo, and I didn't tell him I was going to sleep. 

But now it's been over 24 hours and still no response from him :( It's weird because we were right in the MIDDLE of talking, like I was getting replies from him less than 5 min apart. And then all of a sudden, poof. And it's not like my last message was something that could be a possible conversation ender. 

UGH. IDK. I know the answer - keep talking to other guys and don't focus so much on just one. But I was so excited! I'm really bummed. Can't help but overthink and wonder whyyyyyy he stopped replying and wondering if it's something I did/said. Out of respect for myself I'm resisting the urge to text him again. My last message is very clearly one that is open for a response. 

Ugh. Help - how long should I give this until I accept the loss? Like, I'm trying to continue talking to other people but I keep hoping this guy gets back to me 😩 It's distracting. I feel like I should see it as a loss already because I feel like he would have responded by now if he was interested enough. ",0,1740450851.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

I saw this image floating around on Reddit and thought it would be a great set up for a novel. The basic idea is that it takes place in a Warhammer 40k Parody universe. MC gets sent off to war with his long time girlfriend and are lucky to be placed in the same unit.

After going from war zone to war zone they like to enjoy each other's company when they can get time alone. One day  his unit saves the Commissar that thought that would be her last battle before joining the Emperor and her one regret was never finding love. She is helped up off the ground by the MC and she starts to develop an affection for the young man. She starts by placing his unit in the safe areas away from combat and giving him little gifts like extra ration bars or hot recaf (coffee). She then gives him jobs that would result in him being alone with her, eventually to her personal bed chambers to try and seduce him.

After a few months of this, The commissar is called away for an emergency as they are under attack by the Drukhari (Dark Space Elf). She orders him to stay for safety but after a while a Drukhari breaks in with the mission to kidnap the commissar. being unable to find her, she settles for the MC. He keeps resisting her and she likes when he puts up a fight but so much so, she wont let anyone else hurt him. Eventually falling in love with him.

The Commissar mounts a rescue mission to save him and is taken to safety by his girlfriend and they capture the female drukhari. she speaking High Gothic (Human Language) demands to see the man she loves but keeps getting told no. He goes between seeing his girlfriend and the commissar for weeks cause they were afraid they lost him. One day they are attacked by Chaos space marines of the Emperor's Children and they are on the hunt for the Drukhari. Whole prison break and the 3 end up finding the MC . When escaping into the warp the commissar kisses the MC in front of the other 2 and a fight was about to ensue until MC tells them to stop and they need to focus on getting their base back from Chaos. The rest of the story is just missions to gain resources and allies while having cut aways of intimacy with his harem of bad ass ladies.",6,1740450831.0,haremfantasynovels,7,0.88,False
1ixkcz1,https://i.redd.it/n50rqv6w57le1.jpeg,Picked up the Cup One today…,"My first impression of the Cup One: it’s good but not great like its big brother, KBGV Select. I got a killer deal on an open box Cup One or I would’ve just stuck with my AeroPress for single cup brews. Though, after my first couple brews on the Cup One I’m glad I still have my AeroPress. 

I’m sure I can get a better cup after I get it dialed in. I’ll play around with grind size and ratios some. I don’t like the idea of agitating the grounds with an automatic coffee maker. It defeats the purpose in my opinion and certainly doesn’t justify the limited coffee bar space available. Also not super hip to increasing my brew ratio beyond 16:1 as that just seems wasteful. My first two brews were 250ml to 15g. Both were a tad watery. I tried a slightly smaller grind size on the second cup but not sure it was a big enough adjustment to have any real impact. Grounds are blooming nicely but I’m not seeing the immersion I am used to with my KBGV. In the Cup One the grounds bloom, continue to swell and then tunnel severely. Cup didn’t necessarily taste sour or bitter just weak.

This is not exhaustive--it's made up of companies/businesses/services I've used or admire. (I also repeatedly plug local libraries because they are amazing and also important to support!). Some other disclaimers/notes appear at the end of the post. 

**Media**

* [Find a local, indie bookstore](https://www.indiebookstores.ca/bookstores/): If you don't have a great indie bookstore in your town, then buy from a nearby store that will ship to you. Buying books from Amazon and Indigo is simply no good for authors, illustrators, and the book industry more broadly. 
   * **And don't forget to hit up your local library for books, magazines, newspapers, and ebooks.**
* [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/): a Canadian company, but a subsidiary of Rakuten (a Japanese e-commerce company). In addition to their own books, Kobo ereaders are compatible with library ebooks. 
* For online and print journalism, my favourite Canadian picks are the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/), [The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/), the Canadian edition of [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/ca/), [National Observer](https://www.nationalobserver.com/), [Ricochet](https://ricochet.media/), [Breach](https://breachmedia.ca/), [The Line](https://www.readtheline.ca/), [The Maple](https://www.readthemaple.com/), and [Rabble](https://rabble.ca/). Not Canadian, but I also like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/international) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/).       
* One of the hardest shifts I've had to make recently is to change my streaming behaviour. I love TV and movies and subscribed to several US streamers. I got rid of all of them, although I still use YouTube. I retained [BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/ca?) and also use [CBC Gem](https://gem.cbc.ca/) (save the CBC!). 
   * **I have access to Hoopla and Kanopy through my library (and you probably do, too!). They are streaming services with some contemporary, classic, and indie gems (you don't have unlimited viewing, but your library will give you a certain number of credits).**  

**Department Stores:**

* [Simons](https://m.simons.ca/en): The last great Canadian department store (this article from [The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/simons-shop/) has more on it). Mainly clothing, shoes, and accessories, but also some home goods.    
* [Well](https://well.ca/) (honourable mention to [Terra20](https://terra20.com/)): online-only shopping that carries **lots** of Canadian brands (and you can use their search filter to find them). Cosmetics, personal care, household goods, cleaning supplies, some food and drink, some clothes/toys, gift ideas, and so on. 
   * Some of my Canadian faves include: [Guelph Soap Company](https://well.ca/brand/guelph-soap-company.html), [The Unscented Company](https://well.ca/brand/the-unscented-company.html), [Amoda](https://well.ca/brand/amoda.html), [Green Beaver](https://well.ca/brand/green-beaver.html) (I use their castile soap as an alternative to Dr. Bronner's), [Penny Lane Organics](https://well.ca/brand/penny-lane-organics.html), [Anita's Organic Mill](https://well.ca/brand/anitas-organic-mill-2.html) (alternative to Bob's Red Mill), [Living Libations](https://well.ca/brand/living-libations.html), [Three Ships Beauty](https://well.ca/brand/three-ships.html), [Rocky Mountain Soap Co](https://well.ca/brand/rocky-mountain-soap-company.html).   
   * Also, they're not on Well, but [AG](https://ag.care/) is an awesome Canadian-made haircare company (and they have a 25% off sale going on **now**). 

**Hardware and Gardening**: 

* [Lee Valley](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca?): Doesn't have **all** the odds and sods that you need from a hardware store, but they sell tools, hardware, and home and gardening supplies. Note that this post has a good rundown of [Canadian hardware stores](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/n1ikbo/a_quick_run_down_of_hardware_stores_which_are/). 
* [Home Hardware](https://www.homehardware.ca/en/): many products aren't made in Canada, but it is Canadian-owned, in a lot of communities, and a good alternative to companies like Home Depot, Rona, etc. 
* [West Coast Seeds](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/): my go-to company for seeds (they have lots of options for colder growing zones). 
   * **A reminder that local libraries may have makerspaces, free tool rentals, free seed libraries, and other resources that are no- or low-cost for you.** 

**Outdoor Gear**:

I used to be a big fan of MEC, but since they dropped the co-op and sold to a US private equity firm, I've shifted my business elsewhere. 

* I found that I could replace MEC with three Canadian-owned stores: 1) [Valhalla Pure](https://vpo.ca/), 2) [Altitude Sports](https://www.altitude-sports.com/), and 3) [Sail](https://www.sail.ca/). They all carry some Canadian-made goods.   
* [Surf Ontario](https://surfontario.ca/): wetsuits, rashguards, SUPs, surfboards, and related accessories
* [Frontenac Outfitters](https://www.frontenacoutfitters.com/): canoes, kayaks, SUPs, camping gear, and related accessories
* [Field and Forest](https://fieldandforest.co/shop): small and niche bag shop (e.g., totes, bike bags, etc.). There are only a handful of things in their shop, but they are all Canadian-made. 

**Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories**: 

* [Anian](https://anianmfg.com/): Canadian-made investment pieces that last forever. I own multiple wool coats and wear them year-round. (You can also catch periodic sales).  
* [Yoga Jeans](https://yogajeans.ca/): Denim shop, including a wide selection of items that are Canadian-made. 
* [Little Blue House](https://hatley.com/pages/little-blue-house): Canadian company that sells pjs. I have two pairs (note that they are made in India, at least the ones I have are.). 
* [Tentree](https://www.tentree.ca/): Canadian-owned B-corp, outdoor and casual apparel for adults and kids. 
* [Maguire](https://maguireshoes.com/): Indie, women- and Canadian-owned footwear store
* [Nice Shoes](https://niceshoes.ca/): Canadian-owned vegan footwear store 
* [SteMargScot](https://stemargscot.com/): Ontario-made wool coats. I don't own one of these as they are an investment piece (for me, anyway!), but I admire the company (and dream of this [natural wool duster with heart patches](https://stemargscot.com/product/pure-canadian-wool-duster/)). 
* [Mellow Walk/Oliberte](https://www.mellowwalk.com/): made-in-Canada boots, including safety shoes/boots. (They also manufacture and sell disposable masks). 
* [Thesus](https://thesusoutdoors.com/): [These boots](https://thesusoutdoors.com/products/the-weekend-boot-new-classic-brown) replaced my Blundstones. Love them. Canadian-owned but manufactured elsewhere adhering to responsible manufacturing standards. 
* [Grounded People](https://groundedpeople.ca/): I replaced my Chuck Taylors with [these sneakers](https://groundedpeople.ca/products/campinas) from this Canadian-owned company. 
* [Vessi](https://ca.vessi.com/): My husband and I got waterproof shoes from Vessi for walking our dogs in the rain. Especially useful for autumn/spring in Ontario, but wearable all the time. [These sneakers](https://ca.vessi.com/products/womens-cityscape-classic-storm-black-on-black) were a good replacement for my AllBirds.
* [Province of Canada](https://provinceofcanada.com/): Made-in-Canada wardrobe staples and comfy clothes. I had sticker shock after being used to Old Navy, but the tees fit, wash, and age really well. (See also: [Good for Sunday](https://goodforsunday.com/))   
* [Kotn](https://kotn.com/): Canadian B-corp with modern wardrobe staples and some home goods (we have one of [these quilts](https://kotn.com/products/quilted-comforter?colour=natural&size=o-s) and it's so weighty and wonderful).   
* [Boutique Unicorn](https://www.boutiqueunicorn.com/): shop carrying Quebec- and Canadian-made fashion/accessories for women

**Food**: 

I shop local using farmer's markets, local butchers, local farms, etc., and choose **independent** grocers/restaurants/coffee shops when I can (I recognize this is easier when you're in a larger city.). My go-to drive-thru on road trips is, of course, A&W. 

**Travel**: 

* [I no longer use Airbnb](https://www.newsweek.com/airbnb-boycott-calls-joe-gebbia-elon-musk-doge-2033847). I was already starting to fade on it because of the high prices and uneven quality, but recent news prompted me to close my account. When I travel, I look for independent hotels, inns, and cottages where I can book directly.
* [The Germain group](https://www.germainhotels.com/en) is a Canadian-owned hotel chain in major cities across Canada. They're my go-to and I've stayed in multiple properties (and they're dog-friendly)
* I don't use third-party US apps, like Expedia, but I still use my credit cards to earn points and look for hotel- and airline-specific deals and discounts. 
* I do a lot of camping in provincial and national parks. 
   * **A reminder that many local libraries have things like parks passes and camping gear that you can borrow for free! (Also gallery/museum passes and other tourism-related things).** 

**Disclaimers**:

* Many of the above retailers sell goods that aren't **made** in Canada. Check the details to ensure you're supporting supply chains that align with your values. 
* It's more expensive to shop Canadian-made goods than it is to buy shit from Shein or from shit retailers like Amazon. It's also more expensive to buy from smaller shops who can't afford to stock warehouses full of goods to capitalize on bulk pricing. 
   * **Bottom line**: buying more local may require a shift in buying habits more broadly (and that's probably a good thing). 
* I used to try to support Canadian makers via Etsy, but I've lost interest in the platform as it has grown and changed. I now look for Canadian makers (e.g., through farmers markets, local shops, and artist directories) and support them directly. 
* Just because a shop is Canadian doesn't mean it necessarily follows ethical practices. You can check directories for more information (e.g., [Good on You](https://directory.goodonyou.eco/)), review company policies on their websites, or email them directly for clarity. 
* When I give gifts, I like to get items or gift cards from the retailers above to encourage friends and family to shop more locally. 
* **Shout out to Quebec for being leaders in Canadian apparel and shoe design/manufacturing**. 

**Please share any corrections to my information! This is based on my own research and I appreciate feedback on errors relating to business ownership/practices.** ",14,1740450685.0,BuyCanadian,6,0.95,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So tbfh this isnt really trans related, but I've always felt like I had support from this community, and right now I need support! I've been struggling with anorexia or years, about 7 months ago finally managed to win against laxative abuse. I got...super backed up recently and stupidly took a small dose that helped, and then IMMEDIATELY got rebound constipation. I'm not fat, I don't look it. But this makes me hyper aware of my stomach and it's SO uncomfortable. I don't know how to fix it. I was pooping three times a day, and then this! It stresses me out to the point I want to scream. Does anyone have any advice? I just want to sh*t fucking normally like oh my gosh. 

*Side note: Another reason I ask here is that I know it's not necessarily uncommon for trans men to have suffered from anorexia. I am unfortunately very thin, about 166cm and 46kg the last time I was weighed, and appear to have lost weight since then. I am also an adult, not a teen. I've been told I'd look more masculine and less emo if I had more weight by multiple old ladies 😂😂😂

* Extra Side note: I live in Japan. Finding prune juice etc can be a little....difficult. Like it's around, but my local grocer only ever has grape lmao. I've tried yakult, staying hydrated, coffee, etc but no dice. I exercise, I usually walk at least 6000 steps per day as a min, work a fairly physical job whilst studying as well. Also, if any other trans bros in Japan wanna chat, let me know! It's a prettty quiet scene where I am...I miss the community sometimes.",4,1740450572.0,FTMMen,1,1.0,False

1ixk8l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/1ixk8l2/ordered_a_genesight_test_today_because_my/,Ordered a genesight test today because my psychiatrist doesn’t want to adjust my meds any more until I get this report,"I made a post a few days ago talking about my current issues on the medications I’m on. I’ll summarize here as best as I can. 

So I’m on buproprion Xl 300mg and Amitryptiline 25mg for ocd and anxiety. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for the past 6 years but have changed my dosage a few times to see what works best. I’ve been on Amitryptiline for almost 3 years. 

I’ve tried tons of SSRIs in the past and I did not react well to them, same with other meds like Effexor that was the worst for me. I’ve reacted the best to tryciclic antidepressants, I was on clomipramine too but eventually thought it lost its effectiveness. 

For a while 300mg of buproprion did the trick for me, and helped negate the side effects of my ocd medication (tryciclic antidepressant) but recently I’ve been so tired during the day. You know it’s bad when coffee doesn’t even wake me up anymore, it’s 9am and I had a coffee an hour ago and I’m still tired so by 12pm I usually have an energy drink. I thought maybe decreasing my ocd medication would help with how tired I am, two months ago I went down in dosage a bit after meeting with my psychiatrist (37.5mg to 25mg) but it didn’t do anything for me energy wise. I get 7-8 hours of sleep a night so I’m getting a healthy amount. I work a day job where I commute there and back, I don’t have an issue feeling like falling asleep at my desk or anything I just am always tired. I also am very active and workout 6x a week, I notice at the end of the day like 5pm I have some more energy than I do during the day so that’s when I go to the gym and get a good workout in. I guess the endorphins get me going. I also used to take for a bit adderall but it was more of a quick fix from my psychiatrist and I don’t think I want to go down that path again. 

I’ve also had issues recently with my appetite/cravings being out of control and in the past year gained like 10 pounds (I’m a petite woman). Also I wanted to mention I do not binge eat at all, i just catch myself wanting to eat more snacks than usual. I probably eat about a few hundred more calories than I used to. The constant weight gain is really messing with my head as my OCD has transitioned to fixating on this. I’m obsessed with looking at my body and seeing if I’ve gotten less bloated, skinnier, bigger etc. it’s never been this bad in my life because I used to be 120 pounds for a few years and I’m 138 now. I’m very muscular because of my weightlifting but still feel puffy and overall just big, people say I look great but I don’t feel great. If my clothes fit better and I was a little lighter I know k would feel so much better an have a fear I’m going to keep on gaining weight. Since late 2023 I have not seen my weight drop. 

My life is great, I have a great job family and boyfriend and the only thing I’ve been worrying about is my damn weight and being tired. It sucks. I’ve made some really amazing progress in 2024 too, I got a car after having severe driving anxiety and have been driving great. 

I met with my psychiatrist today and we have already ruled out that my bloodwork is normal, I got bloodwork drawn in November of 2024. I have another appointment in about a month to get blood work again so that’s good. 

My psychiatrist also wants me to do two other things, get a sleep study done to see if my quality of sleep is actually good. I told her it takes me sometimes 30 min to an hour to fall asleep but once I’m asleep I’m out for basically the whole night. Next she ordered a genesight test for me, she said she doesn’t want to change my medication until she sees the results to see what medications actually work for me. The test should come to me in a few days, I’m in network but should get an estimate tomorrow how much it actually is. At this point I’ve been contemplating getting it done for a long time so I don’t mind however much it is, if it will help me with my reactions to medications. So I should get my test in over the next few days and get the results probably next week so I’ll see what happens, I am not relying on this test 100% but I know it’s something that will be helpful. I have a follow up in a month with my psych but I’m hoping I can meet with her sooner to discuss the results and make some changes with my meds. 

I hope this wasn’t too long. Does anyone have experience with this?",1,1740450462.0,antidepressants,2,1.0,False

I build expense reports for a local construction company, and I got the gig because of my basketball coach who is also my boss. I love the guy; he gave me rides to work for the last year, and I couldn't have this job without his support. Well, at the same time, I am the basketball manager. Junior year I did alot for the team, but this year I was replaced by an AI system that does everything I did the year prior. However, I still went to every basketball game, tournament, and event, supporting the team. Sadly, they lost their playoff game in Houston last week. Honestly, I was not that remorseful about the situation. Literally, a couple hours later I asked my boss/coach if I could go to work. (I realize that was insensitive, and he shrugged it off). 
     Well, I've been trying to go to work, but I have to ask him if I can go in b4hand, so there is work for me to do. After basketball season finished, I've contacted him 2 times about work and he didn't respond. He then contact me because at the last game, I forgot to turn on the camera for the first half which is my one job. To be honest, I didn't care. (I know that is selfish), but I moved on from the problem because the other school promised to send the film, which they did end up doing. Now, I want to go in to work so I contacted him one more time, and I was more rude here. I said there is a check waiting for me, but I congratulated him on opening his coffee shop location. All I want to do is work. I like the extra cash but he has not responded to a single text about it. I think it is because he judges my ability to work based off my basketball performance.
     1 Like, earlier in the year I started going to more practices because I wanted to work more, and he didn't respond to me about it until well I went to practice. I think it's really unprofessional of him, but it nonetheless is true. Sadly, I acted with insensitivity and rudeness about everything, by the way I've contacted him, so I sent an apology. Which goes: I wanted to apologize for my attitude after the last  basketball game. It was careless and rude for not doing my job and insensitive for not caring about the team's loss. I am extremely appreciative about my opportunity at COMPANY, and I understand it came because of my time as manager. While I hope you realize that I will never care about basketball in the capacity you do, I am forever grateful for the team. My following question does not disregard my previous apology. So can I pretty please with 2 cherries on top go to work on Friday?
     He hasn't responded and since the time I've sent it today, I know that he has no intention to. While some of you might think he's js busy, I asked some of my other friends if they talked to him since the season ended and they have. Idk what to do. I want to keep the job, but I'm not sure what to tell him. If anyone has advice, or js a similar situation they went through, I'd greatly appreciate it if u share. ",1,1740450277.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

especially reading this sub, it made me realize how crazy overconsumption can get. i looked around my apartment and realized how much junk i had and how it didn’t solve any of my problems. it actually gave me anxiety after spending too much money or having things get all cluttered. i was wasting so much money and not saving a dime and it was running out. it was hard at first, i would tell myself i wouldn’t spend anymore but turn around and buy more the next week. but now i’m so so much better. i only purchase things that are necessary or an occasional iced coffee or lunch out. every so often i’ll treat myself to buying something fun. my house is cleaner and i feel so much better. 

i know this isn’t the typical kind of post here, and i guess i just wanted to say something positive. i know a lot of other people struggle with shopping addictions, and even if it’s cliche to say, you can do it! you can be better than people like mike. one day his money will run out and he will be all alone with his junk. material things and designer doesn’t equal happiness ",13,1740450209.0,michaelduvallxsnark,3,0.88,False

Hey hi! I've beens truggling with ana for years, about 7 months ago finally managed to win against laxative abuse. I got...super backed ip recently and stupidly took a small dose that helped, and then IMMEDIATELY got rebound constipation. I'm not fat, I don't look it. But this makes me hyper aware of my stomach and it's SO uncomfortable. I don't know how to fix it. I was pooping three times a day, and then this! It stresses me out to the point I want to cry. Does anyone have any advice? I just want to sh*t fucking normally like oh my gosh. 

*Side note: I live in Japan. Finding prune juice etc can be a little....difficult. I've tried yakult, staying hydrated, coffee, etc but no dice.

Please, I'm begging. Whether advice or just reassurance from people who have been through the same and came out on the other side",3,1740450018.0,AnorexiaRecovery,0,1.0,False

1ixk0uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinasterideSyndrome/comments/1ixk0uf/progress/,Progress,"I’ve made minor progress after being sick and having my ED worsen pretty dramatically. Can’t tell if this is a diet change either but to be completely honest I’ve been eating like shit. Drinking more coffee is the only thing I can truly think of that’s changed. But usually now my libido is up tremendously not anywhere near where it was still but a lot more than it has been since I took the pill I’m about 10 months into recovery. One thing I think has maybe helped is just accepting it. For months I’ve been so depressed about the condition blaming myself for taking it. Wondering the moments that led up to this. The anxiety of hair loss and the fear I felt not wanting to lose it. And the horrible decision that led to it. I still blame myself but I guess I’m ok with it. There is more to life than sex or hair. Finasteride has no doubt changed my life. But theirs nothing I can really do besides try to treat myself and get treatment for myself the best way I can. And the people around me. Hopefully I can improve more or maybe I’ll get worse. But at this point it’s been so long I’ve just learned too accept it’s going to do what it’s going to do. And it’s out of my control. I think trying to be in control is what got me here. Probably most of us here, and if less people were worried about control the world would probably be a better place. It’s just insanity that this medication isn’t banned. Men being sexually diminished only after one pill is insanity. Fentanyl has about the same effect with your life. But because it’s just sexual symptoms it doesn’t matter. I don’t know who ever thought selling puberty blockers as anti balding medication was a great idea. Hopefully we can get some of these men justice in the future. ",4,1740449835.0,FinasterideSyndrome,0,0.84,False

1ixjzuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ixjzuv/work_as_a_senior/,Work as a Senior,"I have an amazing job. I build expense reports for a local construction company, and I got the gig because of my basketball coach who is also my boss. I love the guy; he gave me rides to work for the last year, and I couldn't have this job without his support. Well, at the same time, I am the basketball manager. Junior year I did alot for the team, but this year I was replaced by an AI system that does everything I did the year prior. However, I still went to every basketball game, tournament, and event, supporting the team. Sadly, they lost their playoff game in Houston last week. Honestly, I was not that remorseful about the situation. Literally, a couple hours later I asked my boss/coach if I could go to work. (I realize that was insensitive, and he shrugged it off). Well, I've been trying to go to work, but I have to ask him if I can go in b4hand, so there is work for me to do. After basketball season finished, I've contacted him 2 times about work and he didn't respond. He then contact me because at the last game, I forgot to turn on the camera for the first half which is my one job. To be honest, I didn't care. (I know that is selfish), but I moved on from the problem because the other school promised to send the film, which they did end up doing. Now, I want to go in to work so I contacted him one more time, and I was more rude here. I said there is a check waiting for me, but I congratulated him on opening his coffee shop location. All I want to do is work. I like the extra cash but he has not responded to a single text about it. I think it is because he judges my ability to work based off my basketball performance. Like, earlier in the year I started going to more practices because I wanted to work more, and he didn't respond to me about it until well I went to practice. I think it's really unprofessional of him, but it nonetheless is true. Sadly, I acted with insensitivity and rudeness about everything, by the way I've contacted him, so I sent an apology. Which goes: I wanted to apologize for my attitude after the last  basketball game. It was careless and rude for not doing my job and insensitive for not caring about the team's loss. I am extremely appreciative about my opportunity at Traux Construction, and I understand it came because of my time as manager. While I hope you realize that I will never care about basketball in the capacity you do, I am forever grateful for the team. My following question does not disregard my previous apology. So can I pretty please with 2 cherries on top go to work on Friday? He hasn't responded and since the time I've sent it today, I know that he has no intention to. While some of you might think he's js busy, I asked some of my other friends if they talked to him since the season ended and they have. Idk what to do. I want to keep the job, but I'm not sure what to tell him. If anyone has advice, or js a similar situation they went through, I'd greatly appreciate it if u share. ",1,1740449754.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ixjzgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1ixjzgn/i_just_need_a_bit_of_feedback_please/,I just need a bit of feedback please,"How to Disappear:
 
I just need a bit of a break. Weighed on scales, I’m not sure my current life should cost the same amount as my freedom. It’s been over four years since my last holiday. Every day, I wear the same loose-fitting white cotton shirt, its armpits slightly yellowed. Drink of coffee stale and only for caffeine. Drive the same roads neatly designed to cause stressful anger for everyone who leaves and starts at the same time. Pretend to look busy while making the same conversation about campaigns and ideas that will never come to fruition, but it makes us sound like we’re doing something! Drive home after the sunset with everyone else in the same positions pissing into traffic of our selfishness, I like to blame the urban planning. Eat not for taste but nutrition of whatever is left in my fridge from the last time I went shopping. Shit, man… I just want to get away for a bit, to camp somewhere remote with no signal, where I don’t have to hear my own voice spoken aloud. Where I don’t have to care what time, it is only that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. No gear, all an idea. 
 
I leave before sunrise. 
 
The city hums behind me, concrete monoliths producing a quiet buzzing for they do not sleep. You can rest when you’re dead. Artificial lights shuffling with shadow’s movements pacing beneath. 
 
I drive west, shaking like a dog taking a shit with excitement. Let’s call it just a weekend away, to myself. A place where the world does not insist upon itself for outside expectations. 
 
The air thickens with the sweating scent of dust and grass as I leave behind the oil and air-conditioning fluid-stained roads of the city. The horizon stretches wide with barren illusions, an invitation to relax. 
 
For now, I tell myself this is a journey, a pause to realign. But as the kilometres dissolve beneath my tires, I know this is something more— God, how nice would it be just to stay out here. An unravelling of what I was told life to be.
 
The road expands before me like a ribbon unwinding on a child’s birthday gift. Each pothole places more distance between who I was and who I am becoming. 
 
The best way to find solitude? Pick up a map. Look for a town at least three hours west of the coast. Make sure the road leading there looks like it was an afterthought. The more it looks like the road is haphazardly placed there the better, you want a town that has existed before anyone would want to visit it. Try not to look past the cluttering of buildings, if you have no expectations to what lies after you can’t be disappointed. 
 
The hum of the tyres against the asphalt is a lullaby. Birds stir as crimson cuts through navy clouds, their silhouettes sharp against the pastel sky, oblivious to my passing.
 
With each town I leave behind, the knot in my shoulders loosens. The buildings grow smaller, the roads quieter, the air richer with a scent I have almost forgotten—the aggressive, unfiltered breath of the earth. I lower my window and let the wind and minuscule debris attack my face.
 
I stop on the side of the road to stretch my legs, feeling the pulse of vastness beneath my feet. The landscape is both desolate and full, a mirage of scale. From a distance, just hazy lumps. Up close, a collection of eroded red rocks and minerals—each particle smaller than the freckles on my hands, yet together with such weight. Open expanse that does not ask for explanations, nor does it like to be. I trace the outline of distant hills with my gaze, wondering if I will reach them before I stop. Or if stopping would mean I got it all wrong.
 
Step One: Begin with the Road
 
To disappear is not to run, but to step deliberately away. The ones who run are chased; the ones who drift are forgotten. The roads have lost consistent maintenance now, a sign I’m on the right path. Each shoulder of the road crumbled of ancient ruins, deterioration meeting the coarse sand that laps at its boundaries. I’ve been driving for a handful of hours now – enough to where the engines rumblings have scratched at my eardrums. The ink-black mountains have appeared into colour of faded, wash green in the distance. A myriad of eyes wink across the desert floor as I pass with haste. Tethered to a polestar I’ve travelled west. 
 
Now’s about the time I’ve begun losing sight of radio towers. A giddy sweat rises on my skin as I slip further into a place where names mean less than presence. I stop at a roadhouse outside a maybe five building town, drinking coffee as white heat stains the sky. Truckers move shuffle and waddle past me, grizzled men of the highways, with sun damage only on the right of their faces, who see only a reflection, another shadow passing through.
 
The further I go, the less of my past remains. Towns become sparser; service stations less frequent, other cars cut through the heat waste, pale ghosts with the dust. I pass into the Outback, where roads stretch like growing pains of an elderly man. Here, the world is untamed. Seems like a remote enough spot for the relaxation I was deprived at home.
 
I stop more often now, pulling over to stare at the endless landscape. Kangaroos dart between shrubs in the dusk haze, and the land itself seems to breathe, exhaling waves of heat and silence. I think I’ll make camp here. Rising and setting of the screaming sun, perched upon the shallow gully with flowing fresh water at the bottom. A short hike from where I left my tether home.
 
Step Two: Erase the Footprint
How easy it is to check the little noise box sitting in my lap. In all honesty it hasn’t been that big of a distraction for my life, a rare message into a group chat, a joke between friends or a daily notification from an application I don’t use. The phone will not be missed. What I will miss is the ability to sell hours for quick scrolls that feels like a minute. 
 
Before my last signal fades, I delete the personalities—social media accounts, cloud backups, emails tied to obligations I no longer wish to recognise as mine. Now, if someone searches, they will find only a mutual mention, I’ve made up my mind I am to stay out here. I switch to aeroplane mode—no more searching for signal. Then, I shut it off completely. I can’t be fucked with any nonsense messages at this point.  
 
In a small town with no name, what’s the use of mine when I am only to pass through, no economy of conversation simply a list of supplies.
 
Step Three: Burn the Paper Trail
 
Out here money is irrelevant. 
I withdrew the skeletal remains of the little lifesavings I savoured over the years. Blackened carcass of my ‘work’ lay unmoving in the iridium sun. 
 
At a small bank outside a pub; distressed white weatherboards, an aluminium roof panting under the heat. I receive my paper. The teller, a woman, her eyes tired and red, holding the years of weight under them, offers no questions only a stern proof of identity. She cares not what I do. I leave with a vague thank you. No more need for proof. No address, no demotion to a series of numbers, no D.O.B. I couldn’t give two shits where they end up—best case, some kid finds them and has a fakie for a few good times.
I am still this night. About god damn time, truly no more reason to go back. 
 
Step Four: A Sudden Absence
 
Now’s about the time old friends and family will notice. Friends will assume I need space. Family will oscillate between worry and resignation. The more I seek, the more I am sought. 
 
I’ve moved on from my original camp now. I didn’t make the walk back to my car, I have no ideas as to what might’ve become of my beloved transport. In fact, I walked the exact opposite direction to what I knew to be of civilisation. From the direction I came, a fortress of debris and dust, pushing towards me, a convex bend into the clean heat. The disgruntled giant intermittently explodes with bright stabs of light bearing witness to the rusted clouds within. 
 
Before me, the pastel vermilion and navy sky danced and swayed with the lumps upon the level horizon. I know why I wanted to walk in this direction, I could never love another as much as I loved to be in solitude. Only now a manifestation of my commitment to this has destroyed my way back.
