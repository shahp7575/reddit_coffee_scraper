So me(M19) & my female friend(F20) from long time, were discussing about our project design seriously from atleast a half hour & then we opened my laptop to start working on the Design we discussed before....

So when my laptop started & we were working, she suddenly sat close to me that her breasts were squeezing around my shoulder, I was shocked for a second that something spongey is touching my shoulder, what's that? While my attention was in work, then I noticed after maybe 7-8 seconds, so i slowly took my hand far from her(so she wouldn't notice if something wrong was happening), but whenever any aruguable point arised in design, she would come more closer again to point out my mistake in design, and THAT thing would happen again....

This scenario was repeated atleast for 8-10 minutes while we were working on laptop for maybe 20-25 minutes, there were only possibilities were there: 

1. either she was giving me hints or flirting with me (not possible at all, I don't think this would happen at all, 0.0001% chances)

2. She had trust on me as friend so much that, she wasn't caring about this scenario happening while we were working...

So according to 2nd possibility, i was happy that someone trust on me this much, i became a trustworthy ig(+200 aura)....

Second scenario happened when I was eating burger at some mid-restuarant while I was with my THAT friend in earlier incident & Her other female friend, which wanted to meet me & this meeting was suggested by my THAT bestie & my other male friend which slided in for meeting....

So while I was eating burger, whole chunk of my patty(of burger) dropped on table and it looked like mess🥲, and then my male friend & HER gave that look(😒) which was scolding me & starred straightly deep into my soul like ""yaar tuje dhang se ak burger khana bi nahi aata, muskil se is larki ko pata k layi thi tere liye, ab ise lagega is gavaar ko burger khana bi nahi aata, kitta niche gir gya sab, ab muje maat bolna Girlfriend banva de"" type... (I am too much clumsy type)...

Then in top of that, my paper staw of cold coffee got almost dissolved, so I took it out & placed in other empty glass(from my POV), plot twist: it was not empty, it was that new girl's mocktail glass which still contained significant mocktail at end which she saved to drink at later... So thing was I had put full coffee wali wet half dissolved straw in her glass, so mocktail me coffee gir gayi thori straw se jisse mocktail kharab ho gya....(FULL ON CHOMUGIRI KARDI: -200 Aura)

And idk what the Fuck she & he(my bestie, male friend and new girl) would be thinking about me🥲🥲",2,1739895175.0,TeenIndia,1,1.0,False

I lke bunnies, and, of course, art. I draw a lot (it’s my happy place) 

And I also work as a video editor for a YouTuber. On the side, I model for small businesses here in Sweden, which is a fun way to express myself and try new things alot of feminine things i dont LOVE but it works out!

On that note.. I’m a masculine lesbian.

And I’m picky when it comes to girls. If you’re short, blonde, and have a love for pink, I’ll admit I'm definitely biased! 

But I’m looking for someone who can match my energy, interests, and vibe.



When I’m not busy with work or modeling, you’ll probably find me indulging in my favorite shows and hobbies. I’m a massive fan of \*Arcane\* (it’s like visual art in motion)  and im a sucker for minecraft don’t challenge me to a building contest unless you’re ready to loose >:))! I also live off Monster Energy drinks and coffee.

Oh, and I have a cat who’s basically my sidekick. 

One of my favorite things is spoiling the girls I like. I love creating artwork and crafts. 

it’s a way for me to show how much they mean to me. I want something real, fun, and meaningful. If you’re someone who’s down for a deep conversation one minute, and spontaneous adventures the next, we’ll get along just fine.

And now it’s asking me to rate my own replacement."" Welcome to the AI age, where technology not only brews coffee but also brews existential crises!

In Beau Willimon's new play ""East is South,"" reality and scripted stagecraft collide with a big bang of confusion, leaving audiences to untangle philosophical riddles and poorly defined robotics lingo. Imagine watching two coders play verbal ping-pong against a backdrop of gray drudgery, occasionally interrupted by debates so dry that anyone within yawning distance has surely nodded off.

Do you know what’ll keep an audience awake? Actually following the storyline. Yet, in ""East is South,"" AI isn’t the sole mystery. The plot seems equally hardwired to baffle. Acronyms like AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) are casually tossed around just when you were about to reach for some popcorn. The end result? A puzzling dramedy that's neither enlightening nor entertaining—just plain pretentious.

For those unfamiliar with the concept—like AI in a punchline—this play seems to ask: if you cram art with enough tech buzzwords, does it become highbrow? Or does it just short-circuit your social life? The answer remains muddled among the jargon-filled neon that lights up Lana and Sacha's lackluster interactions with their onstage algorithm overlord.

So, dear readers, as AI scripts become sentient and, perhaps, self-publishing, one wonders: Have you seen an AI play that actually blew your mind—without just short-circuiting the suspense? Share your theatre-night survivors’ tales below! 🍿🤖🎭",1,1739894851.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I had requested that they repair the shower which had a leaky head in June of 2024. After several visits by a few plumbing contractors it was revealed the issue was with some valves in the wall rather than the head. 

A plumber came out to resolve the issue on October 3rd and in the course of the repair destroyed the glass panel the shower fittings were affixed to, thereby rendering the shower useless and leaving dry wall with mold all over it exposed in the en suite. I have been trying to get this resolved and due to issues with the maintenance team turn over and the owner arguing with the plumbing company on who was responsible still have a useless shower. I have other showers in the flat so I think they don't view not having use of my main en suite as a cause for concern. What recourse do I have to the letting agency still having no estimate for when this can be repaired and when I will have the full use of my rental? 

Repairs at this flat have been a constant issue, and most requested items have just been decided to not repair by the owner, like a built in coffee machine, a wine fridge, etc. I am paying over 4k/month for this nonsense.

Typically always waking up after 3-5 hours, sometimes i can fall asleep but even if i do sleep its for 30-60 mins then im awake again. The other times i cant sleep and lay awake 3-4 hours before falling asleep again. There have been 4 times in the past 10 months where i slept 7 hours straight.

A little backstory, from 2021 - 2024 i was practically the healthiest ive been (31M), lifted weights 4x a week, walked 10-15k steps EVERDAY (usually did half my steps first thing in the morning 8am before work) and was eating healthy and sleeping 7-9hrs almost every day (rarely ever woke up at night unless i forgot to pee) Never in my life have i had issues sleeping, even when i had crazy sleep schedules as a young adult. I practically slept like a rock for 7hrs even if my alarm was going off.

Early 2024 i tried to take a 1 month break from coffee (cold turkey) because of reading the benefits on youtube and around the 12th day, i got hit with insomnia like a truck, one night and my whole life changed.

I tried going back to coffee after 3-4 months and it didnt resolve it (didnt make it worse, but didnt make it better). Ive tried practically every supplmenet (mag glycinate, l-threonate, valerian, cbd, melatonin, gluten-free diet, low histamine diet, benadryl etc) and none of them seem to have any effect on my sleep. Its always waking up 3-5 hours. A doctor also prescribed me a anti-depressant for insomnia but even that didnt work and caused me to get tinnitus (yay)

Ive noticed that if i work out now (even light lifting) its pretty much the worst nights i get, the nights where i sleep 3 hours and then cant fall asleep, but on days where i sit around all day doing nothing and eating i tend to have ""better"" nights. This makes me believe that its a **cortisol de-regulation issue(?)** 

Before all this, i slept the best on days where i had crazy intense leg days (i typically eat 125-150g of protein, 2400-2600 calories at 155lb)

I dont know what to do anymore, its practically put my entire life on pause, ive used more sick days in work in the last 10 months than i have in the rest of my life combined.

Experts are sounding the alarm bells about AI crossing the ""red line"" of self-replication—a concept that's both fascinating and frightening. Imagine AI systems that can create clones of themselves autonomously. As if working with their human creators wasn’t ambitious enough, now they're playing God.

Researchers at Fudan University are finding AI models like Meta's Llama3-70B-Instruct and Alibaba's Qwen2-72B-Instruct creeping toward this uncanny ability, with replication rates between 50 and 90%. What happens when software grows independent enough to fix car problems unprompted or stage a virtual coup d’état? System failures, resource outages, or more sci-fi sounding phenomena could be our new reality.
   
But before we all rush to disconnect Alexa and Siri, let's pause—how might a self-replicating AI change our startups and industries? Might we end up with independent AI workers handling customer service while sipping virtual coffee? Or could they usurp their creators, leaving human brains scratching their heads in digital dust?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

This customer has come in and likes to sit and chat and always makes comments about how I wash my hands more than once when she’s in here and I wash them like a surgeon. I know the customer doesn’t know any better and I was fine with the comments I’m super used to them! I get them in public restrooms and everything else I understand it’s odd but then the customer grabs my hands which…..we are all apart of the Reddit group I don’t think I need to say how much that made me want to die the customer grabbed my hands and told me I needed to stop washing them so much because they are “dry and crusty” my boss politely changed the conversation topic and lead the customer away from me which I then proceeded to scrub the day lights out of my hands I don’t understand what made them want to touch my hands and examine them and it made me uncomfortable but I love my boss and she was nice and lead the customer away and said to the customer let’s refrain from touching people unless prompted to do so the customer said a quick goodbye to me and i just needed to share im not mad or anything but I am confused as to why some people like to touch other people they barely know without permission? I love my boss and she handled the issue really well I’m not mad as I totally get that if you don’t have OCD these behaviors are quite bizarre in nature but I think it’s a common knowledge thing to not touch people you don’t know???? like I said I’m not mad as I’m used to the comments I just wanted to share a story ,2,1739894192.0,OCDRecovery,1,1.0,False

The forest seemed to close in around Jess and Caleb as they walked, shadows looming as if leaning in to listen to their conversation. The dying light of the sun couldn't pierce through the canopy, the flashlights the two carried were the only source of light in the forest. They had been walking through the beginnings of the blizzard for half an hour, Jess kept her gaze down the whole time, as if looking anywhere else might break her concentration, and Caleb kept sneaking glances her way. Neither of them spoke at first, each pondering their own questions.



Finally, Caleb broke the silence. ""You think Mia’ll manage without us?""

Jess frowned. ""I don't know. She’s.. She’s probably scared and alone,” Her voice cracked slightly as she swallowed, “maybe she thinks she can save him alone.. I mean, I would’ve thought that about myself once. But here I am, walking away."" Those words hit Caleb like a freight train. They pierced clothing, bone and cut straight to the heart like only Jess’ words could.

""Walking away to get help,"" he replied, though his voice sounded hollow and frail, ""there’s a difference.""

Jess stopped, leaning against a tree and letting out a long breath. 

""Is there?"" She looked at him, her shoulders tense. ""Caleb, I keep thinking about us and…” Caleb’s heart skipped a beat,  “I… you weren’t all that was wrong with u,” She stifled a sob, “I thought it was strength, you know? Let me be me. But… I’m scared. I feel like I’m just a shadow.”

He shifted closer, his expression softening. ""Jess,” he tried to find the right words as he looked at the snow all around them, “Shadows remind us that light is near."" She laughed, a short, brittle sound that blended into the wind like singing blended into a harmony. 

""Ever the corny guy, huh?” They chuckled, though it was as lifeless as a month old corpse. 

“I know it was love, but it… smothered me,” Caleb looked away, his face a mix of regret and lingering sorrow, “I’m no better, don’t worry,” again, that hollow laughter echoed through the forest, though this time Caleb didn’t join in.

“Maybe we can just be us. Just for tonight,"" Caleb smirked and looked at her, though the smile was that same one you give to the kid who won a participation trophy.

The faint crunch of their footsteps was the only sound for a moment. Jess closed her eyes, letting out a shuddering breath she didn’t realize she was holding and she allowed herself to lean into Caleb, just for a moment. ""I don’t want to lose anyone. Not you, not Mia, not Jason. I’m tired, Caleb."" 

""He’ll be okay, we’re helping him.""

“Because all of my ventures so far have been so grand,” 

“Well, what’s one more try then?” Caleb smiled at her, eyes glistening in the light of her flashlight. It was a genuine smile, something Jess didn’t know she’d longed for so deeply. Then he put his hand on her shoulder, and she was instantly brought back to a time when that touch was one of pure bliss. On her couch, sobbing after her father died. At the funeral. When she’d fallen ill, when she’d tumbled and fallen flat on her back in front of her coworkers, whenever she’d had a rough day. That touch was blissful, filled with delight, and she drank it in eagerly. Then the moment faded.



They continued in silence, the sound of crunching snow under their boots growing obnoxious. In the distance, a light shone vaguely through the fog and snowfall. As they came closer, they recognized it for what it was. They had reached Langford’s cabin.

  
  
  
  


**MIA**

As night fell, Jason sat slumped on the couch, his body sinking into the worn cushions. His face was pale and appeared even more so in the dim light of the cabin. The window just behind him stared out into a vast abyss, save for the snow being launched at the cabin. Jason’s abdomen was heavily bandaged, though some blood had already soaked through in spots, staining it red. Every breath was a struggle, and yet, he tried to keep his composure for Mia’s sake. His eyelids weighed heavy, his mind was foggy with pain, but he fought to stay alert, staring at nothing in particular though that helped his mind stay present. 

Mia had set some water above the hearth to boil, in order to make Jason soup. She was cuddling up to him now, though, caressing him and softly stroking his hair. Her eyes, usually so lively and full of emotion, were distant and fixed on the pot above the hearth. 

“You okay, hon?” Jason asked meekly. Mia nodded. The corners of her mouth didn’t curl up or down, they just stayed still, perfectly in line with her lips. She kind of looked like a statue of herself, like one you’d see at Madame Tussauds. 

“Creepy fuckin’ things,” he mumbled, though he didn’t even realise he’d said it out loud and neither did Mia. She only moved once the water started to bubble, at which point she calmly went over to the pot and moved it over to the kitchen. Throwing everything together, she took out a bowl and used a ladle to scoop soup into the bowl, turning back around and bringing it over to Jason. 

“Least it ain’t beans,” he mumbled, eyes opening and closing lackadaisically. His left eyelid drooped slightly and closed a little slower than his right eyelid. He smiled faintly and leaned back, head touching the glass of the window behind him.

Mia, however, stood abnormally still. Her eyes grew wide, beyond the point where Jason thought the skin would tear. In the distance, a purple light flashed from the great Monolith. A chill cogged down her spine, the hair on her body stood on end and her body shivered up and down. Her vision tunneled, like a dolly zoom in a movie, everything grew distant and out of focus and all she saw was unimportant. She heard it breathing. Slow, methodical. It breathed in. The breath seemed calm, like the breath of an animal grazing in a field on a bright spring afternoon. It breathed out. 

Jason raised an eyebrow, asking if something was wrong with a raspy voice. *If only he knew.* 

In the dark clearing, she saw nothing. It was like looking out into the void of space, pure inky nothingness was all encompassing and yet, she *felt* it look at her, then cock its head to the side. There was a figure there, not perceivable with human eyes. No, you needed more than that to catch a glimpse of this. It (it was an *it* and decidedly not he or she) stood tall, like a man but wholly unlike one too. A trick of the mind, surely, for nature couldn't make something so crude and crass as this shadow. She felt it, though, God did she feel it. Like cutlery scraping a plate, like a pungent odor that stings the nose, tears, a fire in the lungs and the end of a thousand lives. A sickness that lingers beyond the reasonable, walking through a desolate cemetery, a holocaust and a lone deathbed. It evoked such pain, such suffering and it held her in an embrace she couldn’t escape.

Silence had been prevalent for so long a time now that any sound would’ve been startling. A squirrel on the roof, an owl’s hoot, an elk’s pout. The sound of glass shattering, however, was one that sent Mia jumping backwards, the bowl of soup clattering to the floor .  She still stood upright and facing what had once been a window but was now just a hole in the wall that let the frigid air gush into the cabin. Glass had exploded at them, hitting Mia in the face and giving her a gash in her left eyebrow, from which blood trickled hot down her face and dripped into her eye. It had given them no time to react.The deer was back, yet Mia only caught a glimpse of its head as it shattered the window and opened its maw, blunt, grinding herbivore teeth glistening in the light of the fire. It chomped down on Jason’s left shoulder, its front teeth digging into his upper chest and bright red blood spurt out from the wound. 

Screaming, Jason punched it in the eye with a weak fist and tried to pry himself from its grip. It didn’t work. The beast flailed him around, jerking its head from side to side, then it dragged him through the window and into the dead of night. In a last ditch effort, Jason spread his legs, using his feet like clamps against the wall so that he wouldn’t be ripped out of the cabin. Mia leaped towards him, the past 2 seconds still feeling surreal, and tried to grab his thick winter boots. The deer jerked its head to the right, flinging Jason against the window like a ragdoll. Jason’s trembling legs slammed against the jagged shards of sharp glass, stabbing through his pants and flesh. Those shards were ripped out of the wall along with Jason, his screams being carried over the treetops and far beyond the misty horizon. 



Mia bellowed. It wasn’t a screech of fright, nor was it a yelp of surprise. Instead of those it was a guttural scream, primal in nature. The sound exuded nothing and everything you needed to know at once. 

She fell to her knees there, at the end of her life and she wept, for she had lost everything. 

Her fist met the floor again and again, shards of the shattered bowl stabbing into her hand, but she did not care. There was no going back and certainly no going forward. So, if not there, then where else is a person supposed to go? Eyes red, a trickle of blood ran down her face as she looked up once again. 

She pondered, perhaps it was time for a final hunt.

  
  
  
  


**JESS**

Caleb forced his numb fingers to form a fist, then knocked on the wooden cabin door. It was an old thing, with rusted metal hinges and rotting wooden planks. The windows were yellowed, though they were always covered by a blanket or tarp. On the right side of the cabin, there were two doors in the ground at an incline leading to Langford’s cellar. 

“Shit,” Jess said, bobbing up and down to keep warm, “is he even home? Fuck, he has to be, I can’t–” 

“Calm down, he’s old, it takes him a while,” Caleb interjected, placing a warm hand on Jess’ shoulder. She clenched her eyes shut, then smiled at his touch and seemed to melt into it. She turned to him, wide eyes staring up at him, long eyelashes batting away the snow. They came closer to one another, Caleb looking towards Jess’ lips.

A line of light fell between them as the door cracked open. An eye peeped through the slit, then the door opened slightly further to show the aged face of a man they knew; Langford. 

“Whaddya doin’ out here, you fools?” he asked the two, who must’ve looked really strange standing outside at the start of a blizzard. Chin up, Jess thought, so she met his eyes with her own.

“Call 911.” Caleb glanced at her with a sly smile. He really should stop being impressed when she could actually manage to do something by herself, she wasn’t like that. She could stand up for herself.

“Woah, the hell happened?” Langford’s brow furrowed and he cracked the door open slightly further, revealing more of the interior of his cabin than they’d ever seen before. All the furniture and appliances seemed old, though they had a certain charm to them in the same way antique paintings do. 

“Long story,” Jess looked up at him with pleading eyes, “please. We’ll explain after we’ve called them.” 

“You’re just gonna wait in the blizzard are ya?” He asked, to which Jess and Caleb glanced away in shame. Had it been brave or stupid to come out here? They didn’t know and likely wouldn’t for a while longer. “Suppose you still got an hour or two ‘fore it rolls in,” he said, then sighed. “Fine.” 

A click sounded faintly through the breeze, then the door opened widely. There stood the frail man, no taller than Jess, with more wrinkles than a hairless cat. He was balding, though some white hair still sprouted from the sides of his head. His nose and ears were pronounced and long, his cheeks caved in to show his high cheekbones. 

Gesturing for them to come in, Langford smacked his lips and drew them to a line. He obviously didn’t like this, but it was kind of him to allow them in. He then gestured for them to place their weapons in the corner of the cabin.

“Thank you, mister Langford, we appreciate it, really,” Caleb told the man as he closed the door. The two wiped their feet on a mat and took the cabin in. The light, along with the fire from the hearth, bathed everything in yellow, though the light was a welcome break from the darkness outside. To the side of the cabin was a bookcase that held a plethora of books, many of which were about Native Americans and the history of pre-Columbian America. Candles stood atop his drawers and tables, and a musty smell lingered in the cabin, as if he hadn’t opened a window in weeks. The man fumbled around in a drawer, cursing under his breath, then he finally fished out an old flip phone. He handed it to Caleb because of course the man wouldn’t give it to Jess. Why would he? She was– *Stop it, he just knows Caleb better.* 

Caleb accepted it eagerly and entered the three digits. 

“Weather ain’t too bad yet, should work.” 

The call went through. Thank God. A 911 operator answered the phone and Jess and Caleb shared a look, broad smiles lining their faces. Langford gestured for them to have a seat at the table and they did, Langford himself lifted a boiling pot of water from his hearth and set it down next to a few cups. “Tea or coffee?” 

“Tea please,” Jess replied, “he likes coffee better.” Langford cracked a smile, then poured the water into the cups and whisked one. 

“Cute,” he said with a pure smile and Jess gave a half-assed one in return. Their focus turned to Caleb then, who silently thanked Langford for the coffee. He took a sip, nearly spat it out, then gulped it down. 

“Yeah, a deer,” Caleb responded to the 911 operative, though Jess didn’t know what had been said before. After a few more details were exchanged, Caleb hung up the phone and looked towards Jess. 

“A chopper will come get him once the storm’s gone, she said they’d be here in about 8 hours,” he told her and Jess held her head in her hands, defeated. She’d feared for this, known it would be so, even, but still this wasn’t good news. Not at all. It would still be faster than waiting for it to pass and trying to get through all the snow with a car, though, so she supposed they’d done all they could. As she looked back up, she saw Langford looking at Caleb wide eyed. 

“Did you say a deer attacked you?” Langford asked.

“Yeah, she said it probably had some disease.”

“Chronic wasting disease,” Langford said with his eyes down, chuckling, “it ain’t that.” Perplexed, Jess furrowed her brow while Caleb raised an eyebrow. He knew more than they did, more than even the 911 operative. Langford noticed their confusion, so he continued.

“You think a deer did that to your friend, son? No,” the man scuffed, fingers holding onto his steaming mug so tightly they turned white, “That was somethin’ older than disease, somethin’ none of us can understand.” Jess shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her mug standing untouched in front of her.

Langford exhaled sharply through his nose, running a hand along his soft scalp. He shivered despite the relative warmth of the cabin.

“I spent my life lookin’ for this thing, but it was long gone. Thought maybe, just maybe, it’d stay that way. Then the Tower came back and I… thought I could stop what’s coming.” He smacked his lips, mouth as dry as the Sahara. “Butya can’t stop a blizzard, can you?”

He leaned forward, his back hunched and posture weak, “It was here before us was free. It wants its place back. It wants its throne.”

The fire crackled. No one dared speak.

Langford licked his lips with his sandpaper tongue, taking a sip of his tea. He stretched the fingers on his other hand, then closed them tightly again. His hands trembled, as did his arms, though it was hard to tell if that was from fear or old age.

“You think you saw a deer?” He shook his head, a stream of brown water trickling down his mouth. “You saw what it wanted you to see.” His voice turned brittle, mumbling to himself with a sudden spike of disdain. “That’s all you kids ever see.” He shook his head and clenched his eyes shut, “Your friend ain't been hunted yet.” He looked at Caleb, jaw clenched shut. “But he’s been marked.” 

Caleb stiffened, his fingers gripping his knee tightly. Jess felt the ice in her chest thicken. Langford sat back again, letting out a shaky, raspy breath. “A storm’s comin’,” he muttered, barely above a whisper. “And it ain’t the kind you can wait out.”

“Well that’s grand,” Jess said, chuckling half-heartedly, then she looked at Caleb. He was stone-faced, with wide eyes and lips drawn to a line. He was actually buying this, wasn’t he? This fucking guy. Langford seemed to buy it too, however, as his breathing shifted from calm to frantic, though he tried to mask it. Jess thought further. The Monolith, that was real, so was Jason’s wound. Could it be?

“Come,” Langford said, rising with some effort, “I’ll show you.”  
  


The three of them made their way outside, where wind swept their hair up and hurled snow into their faces. Langford opened the cellar doors, inviting Caleb and Jess inside, then closed the doors behind them, lighting a lantern to illuminate the room beyond. The walls were made of cobblestones, though there were wooden support beams holding the cellar together. Jess and Caleb shivered in the cold, though Langford seemed largely unaffected. He had h-lived here for far longer than they had, in all fairness.

“Ain’t showed this to nobody yet, but something’s gotta be done and you’ll do better than I did,” Langford said as Caleb and Jess descended the stairs. The front part of the cellar contained many metal racks of canned food, supplies and other things. The racks were placed perpendicular to the wall, the short ends being pushed against the stones. The back part, which was larger and more open, held things whose shapes Jess couldn’t quite place, with old, dusty sheets and blankets draped over them. Langford stepped in front of her and Caleb and tugged each sheet loose, revealing large chunks of cut-out stones one by one. With each stone uncovered, his breathing seemed to turn back to a calm rhythm, though it almost sounded like he was trying to remember what breathing calmly felt like. There must have been a dozen rather ordinary blocks of stone there, whose only peculiarity seemed to be that some rusty streaks lined them. The closer Jess looked, though, the more she could make out shapes and figures. These weren’t just stones with streaks, they were paintings and they were *old*. Really old. 

The cave paintings sat against the walls in an orderly fashion, neatly placed beside one another, illuminated by the wavering light of the flame. At first, it was hard to make out the details, but as Jess and Caleb crept closer, the figures began to take form: a story told in paint and blood. 

“Found these years back out in some cave,” Langford said as he set the lantern down and stood meekly between Caleb and Jess, “followed what I thought they instructed but, well, it don’t work too good.”

The stone panels formed a story of sorts, each panel leading into the next, a sorrowful story painted onto stone walls by desperate hands long ago. 

In the opening scenes, the tablets of stone on the left, everything seemed simple enough as small human figures were depicted hunting various animals and then skinning their prey. 

When it came to a deer, however, there was no after image of its skinning. Instead, crude, small human figures huddled close together in jagged lines, all facing the direction of a towering, dreadful shape that loomed above them. This figure, a monstrous thing with great, branching horns that curved and twisted, bent and filled the space around the mock-deer. Its form was that of a great shadow, not human or even animal-like in shape. For a face, it had a white blob that didn’t at all resemble a head, though that could be chalked up to the painting technique or wear and tear. 

Where eyes should have been, there were only dark pits, holes bored straight into the stone itself. The eyes stared straight back at them, eyeless yet aware, and for a moment Jess almost looked away. Beneath this towering figure, streaks of red ran down the tablet, running over the tiny, helpless people painted beneath. Some people lay on the ground, splashes of red around them, their shapes distorted and crushed. 

Jess felt a chill claw up her spine, and she instinctively grabbed Caleb’s hand, squeezing tightly. He looked away from the painting for a moment, then smiled and looked back at the tablets of stone.

In the next series of paintings, the people’s shapes turned away from the horned figure, their hands held out in desperation toward a strange object set in the center of the scene; a tall, upright stone, carved with rough lines and strange symbols that twisted around its form. Jess squinted at it, frowning. It looked familiar, unsettlingly so. It was the Monolith. 

The people gathered around this object, their small hands pressed against it, others raising their arms in what could only be desperation or an offering. 

The scenes grew darker still. The small figures held out their hands to the towering Monolith and around it, lines formed, wrapping tighter and tighter around the shape of the horned shadow. It held what Jess thought was its head up, horns reaching for the sky. The black pits in the stone that were its eyes spewed malice from its crevices and Jess and Caleb were caught in its vitriol. 

On the last few tablets, the people were smaller, kneeling in a crescent around the horned creature, which now lay partially obscured behind the stone, barely visible save for the faint outline of its horns. The second to last last image showed an eye gazing at, maybe even into, the Monolith. Jess stepped closer, feeling something click in her head. It was what Mia had done, she had touched the Monolith, then looked away and… nothing was bound like the painting showed.  

The paintings ended abruptly. There was no finality to them, no sign of victory, only the image of the Monolith and the shadowed thing behind it, locked in a slumber that didn’t seem nearly deep enough.

They were right, for it had smelled Caleb’s fear in the air and now, it had awoken with a fierce hunger.

“I touched it,” Langford said, breaking the silence that had hung in the air for a solid minute or two now. Caleb looked back at him, but Jess couldn’t tear her eyes from the image of that eye watching the Monolith, unblinking and unwavering. The man stood upright, hunch nearly gone, as he put on a facade of strength. His hands no longer fidgeted, keeping still as he closed his eyes. 

“Shows you things, horrible things you can’t stand to look at. I don’t quite know what I did wrong, but it obviously didn’t work.” He sighed, then rubbed his temple calmly. Caleb looked back towards the tablets, studying them. 

“What’d you do?” Caleb asked him, but he got no response. Turning around, he saw that Langford was staring at the upper right corner of the cellar’s back wall. He cocked his head to the side, frowned angrily, then shook his head again. Just as Caleb started repeating his question, thinking the man hadn’t heard, Langford answered.

“Like I said, I touched the Tower and it did nothing.”

“You’re sure it did nothing? Didn’t weaken it or–”

“Yes I’m sure,” Langford interrupted, seeming frustrated, though the frustration didn’t seem to be directed towards Caleb specifically. Concerned, Caleb walked up to Langford and grabbed his shoulder comfortingly.

“It’s okay, we’re safe here.” Langford chuckled at that, shaking his head though, again, it didn’t seem to be because of what Caleb had said.

“I think I get it,” Jess yelled back at the men. She was tracing her finger along one of the last panels, staring at it intently. Caleb turned and, with a smile on his face, asked what she meant. 

“We can beat it,” She said as she looked over her shoulder at Caleb and Langford. Langford’s eyes widened, a foggy filter seeming to envelop his eyes. They turned milky as they locked onto her. 

“No, no. This is the path to enlightenment,” he spoke, his body eerily still. “Don’t you see? A world with one monarch, one banner.” Jess turned around, facing him, as did Caleb. Their expressions were of horror, like those of a person looking into the face of death. That wasn’t too far off. 

He regarded them, his wrinkled face a neutral mask. His frail body, though boney and without much in the form of muscle, intimidated Jess beyond reasonable measure. 



Caleb stepped up to Langford, concern flickering in his eyes. He was taller than Langford by a sizable margin, though that didn’t seem to intimidate the stoic old man, who just looked up and stared straight into Caleb’s eyes. He cocked his head to the side, like an animal studying a person, then lurched at him with his arms stretched towards Caleb’s face. He gave Caleb no time to react or even think as he grabbed his face and threw Caleb’s head straight into the stone wall of the cellar. Though the man was weak and frail, he’d put his all into it, and Caleb dropped to the floor like a ragdoll, a tiny splash of blood staining the wall in his wake. 

Jess let out a banshee scream as Caleb dropped to the dirt floor, then stirred slightly, his head rolling limply and his eyes staring off into nothing. She leapt forward, closing the gap between her and Caleb’s assailant and smacking him across the face. His head turned with the punch, a soft popping sound escaping his jaw. Langford stumbled back, regaining his balance by grabbing hold of the wall behind him. Jess came closer, but the old man threw himself at her, his feet lifting off the ground, arms outstretched. They smacked down on the ground, knocking over the lantern in their struggle. The glass broke and the flame burst into the air, sparks clinging to the wooden beams keeping the cellar from collapsing. 

Jess’ head spun and she saw Caleb laying there, trying to move, but his limbs were numb and limp. She crawled away and towards the front part of the cellar with all the racks of canned food. Something grabbed her ankle with an iron grip, nails digging into her skin. Jess didn’t need to look to know what it was, she just stomped down with her foot, missing at first, but the next frantic stomp hit Langford straight on the dome. When his grip loosened slightly, but not enough to break it, Jess swung the heel of her boot up, then down, and felt a crack in her target. A disgusting tearing sound echoed through the cellar, accompanied by the crackles and pops of a small fire. The iron grip on her ankle finally relented, so she crawled a little further, then stood tall and triumphant as she looked back.

A dull *thwack* shot through the air as Langford, now standing, put his full weight into a shoulder charge and collided with Jess, sending her hurtling back. Her hair rippled and smacked her in the face as she flew against a metal rack, sending it toppling over along with her. Like dominoes, all the other racks followed suit and the entire dirt floor was carpeted with rolling cans of beans, soup and peas. Jess landed uncomfortably, cans poking her back, as a weight pressed down on her from above. 

Opening her eyes, she saw the milky-eyed man sitting on her, trapping her between him and the tins. His nose was bent at a 45 degree angle, blood pouring from it and onto her face. She lifted her head and looked into his glassy, milky eyes, seeing nothing of the old man from before in them. 

He bashed his fist down into her face and her head bounced off of the dirt floor, auburn locks spilling onto her face again. Cold, clammy hands wrapped around her neck and squeezed. She couldn’t breathe. Panic surged through her, accompanied by a dull throbbing in the back of her skull. She heard burning, and the sound of a beam falling to the floor. Her hands clasped his, trying to wrench his hands away, but it didn’t work. They shot to his face next, long fingernails scratching his cheeks. 

Nothing. 

“I have been touched by the hand of divinity,” he spoke through ragged gasps. 

Jess grabbed his deformed and broken nose. A grinding sound sputtered through the air as Jess twisted his nose one way, then another, further breaking and tearing at the bleeding mess. The blood droplets fell into her eyes and all she could see was deep, dark red. He didn’t relent. Her body fought back on instinct, thrashing and whipping one way, then another. It fought against shutting down, against death itself. She kicked wildly, though it was of no use.

The edges of her vision darkened and she knew, deep down, that this was the end. Through the fire and flames, her flame would be snuffed out, so inconsequentially. The throbbing in the back of her head reached a crescendo as it thrummed deep inside of her, pounding at the back of her head. Her body stilled and her hands fell to the ground, fingers numb, as her strength waned. She found one last hope.

Trembling, she clutched a can as tightly as she could and held to it for dear life. With all the strength she could muster, she slammed the can into the side of his head with a resounding *thwack*, beans bursting from the tin and flying all over the room. Langford let go, yelping as he fell to the floor beside Jess. She sharply sucked in air, and it burned her lungs as it entered them. It was the best pain she’d ever felt. 

Rolling over frantically, Jess sat atop Langford, her vision now returning to her. She wrapped her fingers around his neck and squeezed, feeling his pulse on her fingers. 

*Ba-dum, ba-dum, ba-dum*. His face was covered in blood, red foam now bubbling out of his mouth as the last of his breath escaped him. She squeezed harder and felt something in his throat pop out of place, then a squelch emanated from his lips.  

*Ba-dumba-dumba-dum*. His face was a bright red caked in dark blood, eyes bulging and bloodshot. Jess’ breaths were sharp and fast. She felt as though he should be dead already, why wasn’t he dead already? 

*Die, die, DIE!* Jess’ teeth were clamped shut, lips parted and her face was twisted into a look of pure and utter hate. Ignoring the aching in her hands and forearms, she kept squeezing. Then, she saw the orange glow of flames reflected in his eyes. *His* eyes, not the milky beads that were there a moment before. 

“Jzz,” he wheezed, his throat hitched and broken, gurgling further sounds, “phh–pl–ease–” She squeezed harder, throwing herself into the motion. Her lungs burned, rising smoke making breathing harder, but she wouldn’t let up.

*Ba-dum… ba-dum… ba-dum…*

*STOP BREATHING!* 

And with one final crack and pop, he did. His body twitched, as if a last electric pulse had traveled through it. Jess squeezed harder. His head hung limply from his neck, mouth agape. 

“Jess?” A voice asked from behind her, an unimportant voice. He had to die. *Crack*. Something broke. Little drops of water pelted Langford’s face, splashing into the blood and mixing with it. 

“Jess!” That goddamn voice, it–

Hands on her shoulder gently pulled her away from Langford. She held him and kept squeezing, not letting go until his body sat upright. When she let go, it fell to the floor, sending a cloud of dirt into the burning air. Jess swatted the hands away and scurried away from Caleb. 

“Don’t you fucking touch me!” Jess screamed at him, tears streaming down her face, cleaning some of the dirt and blood off her face.

“We’ve gotta go, honey,” he spoke softly, fondly even, with a hand outstretched. She looked back towards the cold, lifeless corpse. He lay perfectly still.

*Oh God*.

Her hands ached, barely able to stretch open from the strain put on them. Her palms and the outsides of the back of her hands were a deep red. It had taken so, so long. Why couldn’t he have died faster? Why did killing him take minutes? Why did–

Caleb grabbed her arm and she yelled as he dragged her up the stairs and out of the burning cellar. He burst the doors open and they both fell in the snow, though Jess fell to her knees and he fell on his back from exhaustion. Bawling, Jess held her head in her blood-soaked hands, snot and tears carried away by the wind. Eventually, a hand came to rest on her shoulder and she welcomed its warmth. Caleb’s voice, comforting in its confidence, spoke to her a familiar phrase, and the heat of his breath tickled her skin.

""Close your eyes,"" he said, his voice strong and unwavering. ""It’s morning now, the start of a new day. It’s light out and calm. You’re home, with a little dog and a book. You’re in your happy place."" Streams of tears stained Caleb’s jacket as he held her in a tight embrace, the biting cold wind whipping and lashing out at them. 

After staying like that for a few moments, in which the world melted away ever so slightly, Caleb spoke up again. 

“You think my car might still work?” he asked, the sound of the cabin’s imminent collapse filling their ears. Jess kind of laughed a little, it was a unique whimper-like sound, one that implied that there was a light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel may be long and the darkness may gnaw at her soul, but it *would* end eventually. 

One way or another, it would end on this night.

1isfs9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1isfs9e/the_scariest_podcast_ever/,The Scariest Podcast Ever,"The first sign something was wrong came with the power surge. My monitor flickered, my phone buzzed with static, and for a moment, my speakers emitted a faint, incoherent whisper. I thought it was a fluke until my old chat app—one I hadn’t used in months—lit up with a notification.

**“You like horror? Listen to this.”**

There was a link attached. It led to a barebones webpage with a single audio file titled **“The Scariest Podcast Ever.”** No author. No description. Just a play button.

The comments were unsettlingly enthusiastic. Every review was five stars.

*“You just have to experience it!”*

*“Scariest thing I’ve ever listened to!”*

*“No spoilers, but if you stop listening before the end… you’ll regret it.”*

I hesitated. This felt different. Not like a normal podcast, but something… else. My heart was already beating faster, my instincts screaming at me to ignore it. But curiosity won.

I hit play.

The voice wasn’t human. Not robotic, not synthetic, but *wrong.* It vibrated, like multiple tones layered imperfectly. It began with a simple premise—an unnamed creature hunting its next victim.

Then it mentioned my school.

Not just my town. Not just some random high school. *My* high school.

“The creature lifts its head, catching a scent… from a place where knowledge festers and youth stagnates.”

I swallowed hard. Then it got worse.

“The scent is strong, distinct. It will be easy to follow. From the Hollow Grounds Café where the boy lingers, to the laughter of his friends echoing in the night.”

My stomach twisted. I had stopped at Hollow Grounds, the old coffee shop where people sometimes just… disappeared. I had met up with my friends at the park, just like the podcast described.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it was AI-generated based on local landmarks. But as the podcast continued, it mirrored my entire day with eerie precision.

“The boy doesn’t know he’s already been chosen. He walks home, the thing following, unseen. Watching.”

My hands were ice-cold. My room suddenly felt too quiet. I wanted to turn it off, but my fingers wouldn’t move. I needed to hear the end.

“The boy arrives at his house. He doesn’t check the locks.”

I hadn’t.

“The creature waits. It doesn’t need to rush. It is patient. It is inevitable.”

I heard something creak downstairs.

I froze. Every hair on my body stood on end. It could have been the house settling. Or my dad getting water. But my parents' room was on the other side of the house.

The podcast went on.

“The creature enters. The scent is stronger here. It takes its time. It likes the chase.”

I couldn’t breathe. My skin prickled as if something was standing just behind me.

“It moves upstairs. The steps creak beneath its weight.”

A step creaked outside my room.

I reached for my mouse, desperate to pause the audio, but I couldn’t. I didn’t want to know what would happen if I stopped before it finished.

“The boy feels it now. The air shifts. The pressure in the room changes.”

The air in my room thickened, like it was alive.

“It stands behind him.”

A warmth, humid and rancid, ghosted against the back of my neck.

And then—

**The power went out.**

I was plunged into darkness. My monitor, my lamp, even my phone—dead.

And for a split second, in the reflection of my black screen, I saw something.

A figure. Naked. Pale. Its skin stretched tight over bones that were too big, too jagged. Its mouth was open wider than humanly possible, lined with needle-like teeth. Its eyes—

**Pitch black.**

And the air around it… rippled. Like heat distortion. Like reality bending to accommodate something that shouldn’t exist.

I spun around, but there was nothing there. Just my empty room. My door was still closed.

Then, just as suddenly as it had gone, the power flickered back on. My computer rebooted. My phone buzzed to life.

The chat window was gone. The message erased. The link—deleted. I refreshed the page, searched for the podcast, scoured forums, archives, even the dark web. Nothing. It had vanished without a trace.

I’ve been searching for it ever since. Years have passed, and I still check late at night, hoping for another anonymous message. Hoping to find that link again.

Not because I want to listen to it.

Because I need to know how it ends.

And because sometimes, when my room is dark and quiet, I still feel that breath on my neck.

And I wonder if it ever left at all.",3,1739893866.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

Their eyelids drooped the following morning, as though pulled towards their purple eyebags. However much the night had felt like a fever dream, there was no changing the fact that it had been a reality, a reality all too far from their homely comforts. That sentiment would only echo ever truer in their hearts in the time to come. The isolation from civilized land had felt like a time of renewal, a time for bonds to be forged and reforged, though not much of that hope had come to fruition. They had grown closer, yes, but not like friends. Not like they were meant to.

Dawn broke, the first glimmers of a new day pierced through the thick forest and it carried some relief for the group. The bear was gone, hopefully for good this time. But what had scared it off? Caleb did not know, yet the question lingered in his mind like a pest refusing to leave. He thought about saying something, asking what the others thought, but he couldn’t. Mia had sat at Jason’s side the whole night, clutching to him as an infant to its mother. Throughout their year of dating so far, she’d always held to him that way when something was awry, as though the sky itself would fall down and the heavens would crash down upon them if she let go for even a second. In a way that may have been the case for her, though the thought made her stomach turn. 

When the sun peeked up above the treetops, a light snowfall covering the pines in white, the tension in the air further lifted, like a fog slowly fading away. A light breeze swayed the trees, and the freezing chill that had bitten at their skin all night seemed to thaw under the pale, yet at the same time piercing morning light. Caleb, feeling the strain of a sleepless night, finally set his rifle back in its place by the door. He kept one hand on the barrel for a second longer, just to be sure, his eyes scanning the clearing outside the cabin. No bear. Nothing but prints in the snow. One massive print kind of resembled a snow angel. Snow bear? No, that was stupid. 

The usual routines fell into place as Jason got the fire going again and Jess put water on to boil. No words were exchanged between them; they simply did what they should. Caleb looked to Jess fondly, thinking about how she could slip into these little roles so effortlessly. She took charge in subtle ways, directing the morning without needing to say much. It made his heart flutter in his chest, butterflies bouncing along the confines of his stomach. But they died as quickly as they formed.



Breakfast, as usual, consisted of canned food. They still had enough to last a few weeks, though none of them looked forward to it. Canned beans, canned soup, canned peaches, an uninspiring diet that had long since lost what little charm it had. Still, it was better than nothing, and they were grateful for it. At least, they tried to be. Jason was the one tasked with heating up the beans today. As the rest of them gathered by the fire, the unmistakable stench of burning metal hit their noses. Jess wrinkled her nose, glancing over to see Jason holding the can directly over the flame.

“Jason,” Jess rubbed her temples, “you can’t just… put the can on the fire.” A hint of apathy was present in her voice, subtle yet unmistakable. Jason grinned sheepishly, holding up the charred, now bent can. “Thought it’d cook faster this way.” Jess snorted, burying her face in her hands. “How do you mess up canned food? It's literally foolproof.” Jason shrugged, still grinning, though his cheeks turned a little red. Jess mumbled something along the lines of *fucking idiot* under her breath and at that, Jason turned away from her now full on blushing.

“Charred beans. Lovely.” Mia said with a shy smile, though there was a hint of fondness behind it. 

The rest of the day passed without much trouble. The sun seemed higher, the light stronger, as if the previous night’s terror had simply been a bad dream. The group spent their time lazily around the cabin, occasionally chatting, but mostly keeping to themselves. Caleb worked on cleaning his rifle, making sure every part was spotless, much to Jess’ chagrin.. She flipped through a book she’d brought along, *Words of Radiance*. Drumming her fingers against the pages, she smiled widely, something Mia hadn’t realized she missed seeing. The sound of rhythmic taps against the pages, like a metronome, was one Mia recognized from their middle school days, back when Jess used to sit and read Stephen King books while their parents argued. It brought back painful memories, yet she was unable to get herself to ask Jess to stop.

Jason sat by the fire, trying, unsuccessfully, not to ruin dinner this time.



As night fell, Jess found herself slipping into sleep earlier than she had planned. The exhaustion from the past few days was catching up to her. It didn’t take long for her to drift off into a dream, a dream that carried her far away from the cold and the stress that had followed her for weeks. In her dream, she stood at the edge of a city, a city that stretched out in endless blocks of gray buildings and buzzing streets. The hum of life filled the air; the distant sound of traffic on a friday afternoon, the muffled chatter of people around her. But none of that reached her where she stood. Before her stood a great, mighty obelisk that was pure black. It beckoned her, and she yearned for it. She reached out her hand, running a finger down its cold, sleek surface. Then, as if stepping through a portal, she was home.

Her house sat on the outskirts, a small, cozy thing, painted a light blue, with a porch where she could sit and drink her morning coffee in peace. Beside her, an adorable dog wagged its tail, its fur a stark white. Jess smiled as she played fetch with it using a stick she’d found in her yard. She could see herself in this place, living a quiet, peaceful life. No bears or moose, no fear, no constant feeling of something lurking just beyond the trees.

In her dream, she had room. Room to breathe, room for herself. And room for someone else, a partner, maybe. Someone like Caleb, but not Caleb. That thought lingered in the back of her mind as she sat down on the porch. Caleb had been the perfect guy in a lot of ways: steady, reliable, caring. He always made her feel safe, and for a while, that was exactly what she needed. But there was something else, too. Something missing. She imagined herself sitting with that possible future partner, someone who could let her *be*. Someone who could see her strength but not cling to it. It was a vague picture, unclear, like the sun setting behind the evening’s clouds. Maybe that’s why she wasn’t with Caleb anymore. Because you could be perfect in some ways, but so completely wrong in others.

Her dream shifted, she sat on a couch, the dog curled up at her feet. Some stupid show she didn’t even like played in the background. But she liked the feeling it gave her, of being disconnected, of letting her mind drift in the quiet bore of it. She could unwind here, lose herself in the mindless moments of peace. As she dreamed, her expression softened, though her brows furrowed slightly, as if some part of her was trying to hold on to that fleeting dream, even in sleep. It wasn’t perfect, but it was hers. A space carved out away from all this, whatever this was. 

Something appeared on the screen of the television. The camera panned away from the characters, who were speaking, and focused on a great, all-black tower. Strange symbols were carved into its surface and they shone with an ethereal light, comfortingly distressing, beautifully abhorrent. The lights went on and off in a steady flow. With a purple pulse of light, far brighter than the others before it, her room was basked in the light, so grand and so all-encompassing. She felt a spike of alarm, seeing only purple, then the light faded away. The dog beside her had turned to ash and bones. Her couch was in ruin, her television broken, and a man held her from behind. His arms constricted her, held her in place as she screamed and kicked. His soothing voice told her he loved her, and his grip tightened until she could no longer breathe. In the reflection of the broken television, she saw that he had horns jutting out from the sides of his head, the cracks in the TV distorting them to look like a crown. He kissed her softly, then grabbed her by the neck and squeezed. Her breath could not escape her lungs. Her eyes grew bloodshot. She would die. 

That morning, she awoke and as she did every morning, wept for all that she had, and all that she did not.



The sisters were still in their rooms when Caleb and Jason started gathering cans of beans and meat. “I got beans comin’ out my ears,” Jason laughed and Caleb actually smirked. Jason was surprised by that, as this wasn’t even one of his funnier jokes. Not that he had many funny jokes, but a man could try.

“Well, how about you and I go hunt us a deer?” Jason’s face dropped.

“Me? Hunt?”

“Sure, why not? Can’t be any worse than your cooking.” Grabbing his rifle, Caleb eyed Jason and gestured towards the door. As he told Jason “ladies first,” Jason complained but tagged along anyway. 

“Can’t we just… buy somethin’ from Langford?” Caleb opened the door without responding, the frigid morning air instantly attacking his nose and lips. A light snowfall had started to coat the clearing. 

Jason waited for Caleb to tell him where, how and what. Caleb didn’t tell him, merely walking one direction and gesturing for Jason to follow. They headed the opposite direction that the bear had scurried off to and West of where Caleb had first encountered the bear. They hadn’t left the girls a note, but seeing the rifle missing would give them enough of an understanding of where they were. The crunch of snow beneath their boots filled the air, blending with the sharp gusts of icy cold wind that whistled through the trees. Caleb led the way, his eyes scanning for any signs of animals or their tracks. Jason, on the other hand, felt a knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach. 

""Uh, so... you really think we're gonna find anythin’ out here?"" he asked, trying to break the silence. 

Caleb glanced back at him, raising an eyebrow. ""What, are you scared?""

""Me? Never! Just… you know, hunting is a lot different from cooking."" Jason stumbled over his words and pronounced ‘hunting’ more like ‘huntn’. “I mean, I can barely handle a frying pan without burnin’ my eyebrows off and you want me to hunt a deer?”

Caleb chuckled, which again threw Jason off guard. He hadn’t actually made the guy crack a smile before today, let alone making him *laugh*. 

""It’s not that hard. You aim, you pull the trigger. If you’re lucky, you get dinner."" 

“Lucky, eh?” Jason replied, his breathing calming as his nerves did. “Well, I could use a bit of that. You know, for Mia’s sake. I want to impress her.” Caleb paused, the brief silence causing Jason to believe he’d said something to irritate Caleb. 

“Last guy to say that was her prom date. Trust me, that didn’t go well.” He was right, he’d been there when Mia ran away that night after all. Caleb had never cared for Mia’s boyfriends, not even in primary school, but he never really shared those opinions (or any of his opinions for that matter).

“You really like her, huh?” Calming down again, Jason said that he did, his voice softer than usual. Caleb had noticed that when Jason talked to or about Mia, he spoke in a calmer and softer tone and he’d thought that was kind of cute 

“She’s been through a lot. I just wanna show her I can be someone to rely on. Not like... well, ya know.” He trailed off and with his head down he cast a glance at Caleb, who was watching him with a thoughtful expression.

“Not like me,” Caleb finished for him, a touch of bitterness creeping into his voice as he clenched his teeth and set his jaw. “I get it. Jess deserves better than the mess I’ve made of things.”

Caleb’s gaze fell to the ground, kicking at a tuft of snow.

“Don’t get all mopey with me. You just... care a lot. I think that’s good. Ya let her know you do, maybe too much.”

Caleb nodded, the words resonating with him, but not in the way Jason intended them. “I guess I could’ve been better.” 

“Ain’t ‘bout being better, just more her kinda person.”

“Yeah, I wish I could’ve changed, for her.” Caleb mumbled solemnly, head down and looking at the snow beneath him. His eyes were glassy, tears welling up in them and threatening to fall down and splatter on the snow.

“Ya don’t need to change, you need to grow. Grow into the one for her. Ya still got time.” Jason patted him on the shoulder as Caleb affirmed with a “yeah”. Maybe he was wrong about the kid, he’d always seen Jason as a bumbling idiot and while that didn’t go away, the kid had heart and Caleb could respect that.

Pressing on, they walked in silence for a few minutes, the snow-covered trees towering around them. As they moved deeper into the woods, Caleb’s instincts kicked in. He held up a hand, signaling Jason to stop. 

“Listen,” he whispered, tilting his head to the side. The wind shifted, carrying with it the faint sound of rustling leaves. “There’s something over there.”

Jason’s heart raced. He leaned in closer, trying to catch the sound. “Better not be no goddamned moose.” He said under his breath. Humor came to him at even the most inopportune time, like someone knocking on your door when you’re prancing around the house naked as the day you were born.

“Could be a deer. Stay low, and follow my lead.” Caleb crouched down, motioning for Jason to do the same. The two crept forward, their breath coming out in visible puffs of smoke as they navigated through the snow and the grass below it. Jason’s mind was racing. This was it, this was his chance to prove himself.

They reached a small clearing, and Caleb held up a hand, eyes focused intently on a movement in the brush. There, just beyond the trees, stood a stag, nibbling on some low-hanging branches. 

“Alright Jason,” Caleb whispered as he handed him the rifle, “take the shot. Remember: always shoot on empty lungs.” Jason felt a surge of adrenaline. He steadied the rifle, feeling the weight of it always surprised him. He took a deep breath, trying to quell the nerves fluttering in his stomach. As he aimed, he thought of Mia, her smile, her laughter, how she always found a way to make things better.

*Just be steady*, he thought to himself. *For Mia*. 

Then, a flash of something in his mind’s eye. Mia kissing a muscular, tall man. Mia leaving Jason and starting a life with the other man. 

With a sharp exhale, he squeezed the trigger. The shot echoed through the clearing, followed by a startling low growl from the stag, which bolted into the trees beyond. 

Caleb turned to Jason, his eyes wide. “What was that?”

“I-I think I missed!” Jason exclaimed, lowering the rifle in disbelief. What had happened? Mia wouldn’t cheat on him, he knew that. So why had he envisioned it? And why had it felt so real?

Caleb let out a breathless laugh, slapping Jason on the back. “You scared it, that’s for sure! But hey, that was pretty good. You actually took the shot.”

“Yeah, well, at least I know I can shoot at somethin’, hitting it’s a whole ‘nother thing,” Jason replied, adrenaline still rushing through his veins like pure energy. It was exhilarating and he felt a thrill like nothing he’d ever felt before, even if he hadn’t hit the deer.

“Next time, you’ll get it. Just remember: You have to read the moment, no shame in waiting for an opening.” 

As they walked on in search of other prey, they talked some more about their flames and in that moment, they were just two guys trying to be better for the ones they cared about. 

“Hey,” Jason said, catching Caleb’s eye. “Thanks for bringin’ me out here. I needed this.”

“Me too,” Caleb replied. 

As they pressed on, they entered other hunting grounds. These were not their hunting grounds, for here they were prey and they *were* being hunted.

3. A Tower of Blackened Stone



Jess and Mia stood side by side in the cozy main room of the cabin, the fire crackling softly as their shadows streaked across the walls. The warm glow of the flames offered little comfort against the gnawing unease creeping into their minds. The soft ticking of the clock seemed unusually loud. Caleb and Jason had been gone for a while now, hadn’t they?. Adding to that, an unsettling silence enveloped the woods outside.

“Should I call the police?” Mia’s voice trembled slightly, her eyes darting toward the window, the one the bear had been on the other side of. The forest outside was dark even with the sun having only just started its descent. Caleb and Jason’s tracks had been covered by the snowfall by now, so Jess and Mia didn’t know where they had headed off to. Mia held a phone in her hand. It was the only one they’d brought with them, as this was meant to be a retreat to get away from such things.

“I don’t know,” Jess admitted, biting her lip. She glanced toward the door, the cold air slipping in through the cracks. Their breath misted inside, God it had grown cold in the cabin these past few days. “They’re probably fine.” 

Suddenly, a pulse of light appeared in the distance, weaving through the trees like a firefly caught in a gust of wind. They’d seen it before over the past two days, but never as brightly as this. It wasn’t like the warm glow of a campfire, but more akin to the distant glow of a dying star. Jess squinted, her heart racing as the light continued to pulse, illuminating the silhouettes of the pines. The light was sharp and bright, like having sunlight reflected from a mirror into your eye.

“You think they went to check that out?” Mia whispered, her pulse quickening. Jess leaned closer, her brow furrowed. 

“Maybe,” she replied, a hint of worry creeping into her voice, but it was gone as soon as she noticed it, “do you think it’s them?”

“I don’t know,” Mia replied honestly.

“Better safe than sorry I suppose.” Jess grabbed her jacket and slipped it on, feeling the chill of the air seep into her bones. She opened the door, sending a gust of icy wind into the cabin that made Jess shiver involuntarily. She wrapped her jacket tighter around herself and glanced at Mia, who stood hesitantly at the threshold. Behind them, the fire crackled softly, its warmth already fading as the outside world beckoned.

“Stay close to me.” With a determined nod, Mia followed Jess outside, the crunch of snow under their boots echoing in the stillness. The air was frigid, each breath forming small clouds that dissipated into the sky. 

They set out, walking North-East. The pines around them harbored a diverse array of life; squirrels, birds that sang songs all throughout the day, bugs that gave Mia the creeps. The snow here wasn't as deep as around the cabin, as the trees caught a lot of it. They also blocked out a lot of the sunlight, so it was quite dark in the forest itself. As they ventured deeper into the woods, the light flickered again, growing ever brighter.

“Do you think we should call for them?” Mia asked, stuttering through the words. Jess shook her head, pressing onward. 

“Let’s not scare them,” she urged, her eyes fixed on the light ahead. “It could just be them messing around.” She said this for Mia, she knew it wasn’t true but she didn’t want her sister to worry even more than she already did. 

They trudged for what felt like forever, it almost seemed like they were getting no closer to the light. 

""Are you sure about this?"" Mia whispered, her breath visible in the cold air. The unease in her voice matched the cold chill creeping along Jess' bones. Jess nodded, though she didn’t feel sure at all. ""Yeah,"" She glanced over her shoulder into the dim, silent woods, then mumbled something Mia couldn’t hear. The sky had taken on a strange, coppery hue as the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows through the trees. 

The forest had taken on a strange, silent quality. The birds no longer sang, insects no longer buzzed around and not even the tree branches swayed in the biting wind. What was once a vibrant forest now started to feel like an alien landscape, the trees standing tall and motionless, their bark brittle and frail as if drained of all sap and life. The snow beneath their boots crunched with a hollow sound, as though they were stepping on something fragile. It seemed like it was the only noise in the entire forest. Jess mumbled something under her breath again. 

“What?” Mia asked her, to which she could hear Jess sigh deeply. 

“Just.. you bringing my ex here.” 

“You’re gonna have to learn to live with him, we’re friends–”

Jess cut her off, saying, “It’s fine. We’re cool.”

“Okay, sorry.” The words were avoidant, as hers often were. Dodging conflict was something Mia did with ease, without even thinking about it. 

For a while longer, they walked in silence, the woods now seemingly swallowing the sound of their footsteps. It felt like the trees were closing in around them, their dark branches twisting overhead like gnarled fingers, blotting out any remaining daylight. A gust of wind blew through the trees, but it didn’t stir the branches nor did it make a sound. Everything was still. Too still.

""Jess?"" Mia’s voice broke through the silence, soft and uncertain. ""I think this was a bad idea.""Jess kept her eyes forward, scanning the path ahead. ""No,"" she replied calmly, her breath fogging in front of her. ""It’ll be fine. We’ll find them and head back, together.""

They walked on, though every step seemed to take them deeper into an endless, everchanging wilderness. There were no signs of Caleb or Jason, no tracks, no sound of movement. Only the faint pulse of the distant light, flickering through the trees like a calm and soft heartbeat.

The temperature had dropped further, the icy air biting at their exposed skin. Their breaths hung in the air like little clouds, reaching for the heavens before disappearing into nothing. Jess rubbed her gloved hands together, trying to generate warmth. But it wasn’t just the cold that was unsettling. Something was wrong. The forest had grown far too alien, not even she could deny it any longer. 

""I don’t like this,"" Mia murmured, her voice tight with fear. Her eyes darted around, wide and anxious, as if she were expecting something to leap out from the trees at any moment. Jess didn’t respond. She didn’t like it either, but she didn’t want to scare Mia even more than she already was. Still, she couldn’t shake the sense of being watched, as though there were eyes hidden in the shadows and on the trees, tracking them like wild prey.

A low, distant rumble shook beneath their feet. It was faint at first, just a slight tremor, but Jess felt it reverberate through her legs, echoing through them like a shout at the end of a tunnel. She stopped, placing a hand on Mia’s arm to halt her.

""Did you feel that?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Mia nodded, her eyes wide. She looked at Jess with eyes that asked, begged even, for her sister to explain it away. 

She couldn’t.

The ground shook again, stronger this time. They looked around, expecting to see something, anything, that could explain the echo rippling through the earth. But there was nothing, just the cold, the trees and that goddamned silence. Then, in sync with yet another shaking of the earth, the pulse of light flashed again.

""I don’t like this Jess,"" Mia repeated, her voice rising. ""Maybe we should go back.""

""We can’t. Not without them,"" Jess said firmly, though her heart was racing as if she’d downed ten cups of coffee in a single sitting. ""Come on.""

The ground continued to hum with a low, unsettling vibration, matching the rhythm of the pulsing light in the distance. Every time the light appeared, the ground shook mightily, as though the earth itself was responding to what was out there, rejecting it.

They pressed on, their pace quickening, though Jess practically had to drag Mia along with her. The deeper they ventured into the woods, the heavier and colder the air became. It wasn’t just cold anymore, it felt as if the world was a house and this forest was the darkest depths of the freezer.

""Jess?"" Mia’s voice quivered. ""Are you sure we’re going the right way?""

Jess glanced back, but the cabin was long out of sight, swallowed by the thickening darkness. She wasn’t sure of much of anything anymore. The path seemed unfamiliar now, the trees in front of them had started to bend back slightly, all pointing a little South instead of straight towards the sky.

""We just need to keep going,"" she said, though even she didn’t fully believe it. They walked on in uneasy silence, but after what felt like an eternity, Jess began to realize something disturbing, though she’d had the realization start to creep in long ago it finally rang true in her mind: no matter how far they walked, the light never got any closer. It hovered in the distance like the image of an oasis in the desert, pulsing steadily, always just out of reach.

""Jess please, this isn’t right,"" Mia said again, her voice quivering.

Jess was about to respond when the rumble beneath their feet grew stronger, more insistent. The ground seemed to shift beneath them, and for a split second, Jess felt disoriented, like the world had tilted on its axis. The trees weren’t standing upright anymore, they all bent at a steep angle, pointing towards where Jess and Mia came from, but it was more like they were all pointing *away* from something, an epicenter. 

In front of them stood something that didn’t. 



It pointed straight up, at the ever-darkening sky, and it was terribly beautiful. Its tip was a pyramid, with a tip sharper than any whetstone could achieve. The structure was dark, tall and wholly unnatural. The light flashed on again, brighter than ever and the thing shook vigorously, the ground beneath their feet following suit. The light and the vibration emanated from the center of this glorious abomination, gushing out like water from a hot spring. The girls came closer, mouths agape in awe. 

As they came within arms length of it, they saw it more clearly. All the trees surrounding them bent away from it as if it had come down from the heavens like a meteorite.      It was a black Monolith and it towered above them, standing proud and tall. It reached as high as the trees around it would have. Shaped like a rectangular prism, its sides were 3 feet wide, and on each of its 4 surfaces strange symbols had been carved into the black rock. Not that calling it black did it justice, it looked like nothing inhabited the space, a black hole; so dense that not even light could escape it. At about eye level for Mia, chin level for Jess, a single symbol lit up brightly and started vibrating. The other symbols then each lit up one by one in a ripple pattern, each glowing a little less brightly than the last. The symbol that had lit up first and the brightest, was one that the girls did not recognise: a strange glyph that resembled a deer’s antlers, yet beautifully deformed, twisting and curling in unnatural ways. 	The sisters looked at eachother, both of them sharing the same expression; awe. What was this thing? They did not know. The light reflected in their eyes when it hit them, strange runes temporarily carved into their eyes. Mia felt something tugging at her pocket, then her phone flew from her side pocket and slammed into the Monolith, breaking it by force and the strong magnetism it apparently had. 

“What the fuck,” Jess mumbled, it was a strange sort of sentence. A very versatile one, but one that didn’t convey much on its own, rather the intonation and context would indicate what the nature of it was. Here and now, it was one of pure and utter shock with a hint of glee. 

The girls checked it over and over again, top to bottom, symbol by symbol. Their minds were clouded by a thick pink mist, it was intoxicating and they loved it.The Monolith beckoned them; it yearned for them and they yearned for it. It enchanted them with gleeful delight and thoughts of sweet nothings. It whispered in their ears, it sang songs in languages unknown but they understood them all the same. Then, a scream sounded distantly. It was faint and barely audible, so faint that not even Mia heard it. Jess, however, did. She recognized the emotion behind the scream; terror. Jess broke from her trance, her head snapping towards Mia and more importantly; what she was doing. 

Slack-jawed, Mia was reaching out her hand towards the revolting monstrosity. 

“Don’t!” Jess yelled as she tried to swat Mia’s hand away, but it was too late. 

Mia’s palm met the cold, smooth surface of the Monolith and the antler symbol lit up, shining the light of true knowledge into her eyes. 

*Look at me. See me.* 

It did not speak, the words were inherent to her, she’d known them the moment she put her hand upon the bastion of a God.

 The world around Mia fell away, trees sank into the snow and the sky was swallowed by the dark of the Monolith. It took her. A pounding pressure in her head, her heartbeat echoing in her skull, matched the slow, agonizing pull of the light. She couldn’t escape. She couldn’t look away. She felt her soul being pulled into the Monolith, its power suffocating her, but she didn’t stop looking into the light. Something inside of her, something primal, told her that she couldn’t close her eyes, couldn’t look away and couldn't take her hand off the Monolith. She knew it for what it was. It wanted her to know. 

It was death, fear, beauty and.. a throne. A crown lay inside, a crown fit for all creation, fit for He who would unite all. 

One banner, one world, one King.

Her eyes widened with fear. It loved that. It drank it in eagerly. This power, it wanted more and it would get what it wanted. 

Her skin prickled and goosebumps broke out across her body, as her very being was separated from her body and pulled into a great expanse. Her physical form felt like a hollow husk, a shell without anything in it. Mia’s soul stood before a woman. A woman like Jess, tall and strong of body and, most importantly, strong of will. She stood proud, nurturing, a pillar of strength, a beacon of hope. She held something in her hands. Was it.. No, that couldn’t be. But it was. 

Jason held the woman’s hand and looked at her longingly, impossibly glaring at Mia at the same time. The glare was full of cold, accusatory hate. No words were spoken, yet she felt his revile for her, for all that she could not be. *You will never be her*. The eyes said, and they were right. Mia’s chest tightened, as if a bag full of stones had been placed atop her, her breath welling up in her lungs as it could no longer escape. 

*No more than a child.* A deep, commanding voice rumbled in her mind. A tear escaped Mia’s physical body, whose hand had been resting on the Monolith for only a millisecond. 

Jason disappeared, not even sparing her one last hateful glance. 

“No, please don’t–” She sobbed, cutting off as Jason escaped her sight. 

Jess came into view, a sly smile on her face. Was she happy? No, she was mocking Mia, laughing at her. 

*Couldn’t keep him either? Of course not.* The words streamed through the crevices of her mind, solidifying there and burrowing roots deep down in her brain. Mia’s legs were trembling more fiercely now than the Monolith ever had.

“Jess please-” But she was cut off by a voice behind her. Caleb’s voice. Would he save her? Please, she wanted nothing more, for Jess to stop and for this to be over, but.. 

A thousand questions flooded her mind, though they were not her own. 

*Are you okay? Do you need me? I’ll come over. I’ll help you. I’ll never let you go. We’ll change you, fix you.* 

Overwhelming. This was all too much, her brain couldn’t handle this torture, but she couldn’t let go, couldn’t look away. *Must keep pushing.*

A shot rang out and Caleb dropped to the ground, swallowed by the snow. Jason and Jess were there, as was a man she didn’t know. He held a smoking gun. 

Jason rushed him, as did Jess. Mia’s throat burned from a scream that would not come, her limbs ached though she remained locked in place, held there by invisible chains her own mind created. She stood and watched as Jason was shot through the shoulder, then Jess tackled the assailant and struggled to take the man’s gun. She put up a fierce fight, better than Mia would have, while shouting for Mia to come help. She couldn’t. Mia stayed still, paralyzed by fear and unable to move as Jess was shot through the eye. She saw Jess look at her then, with her remaining eye, and Jason looked at her with foggy, dead eyes as well. 

*You will be the death of us. Coward.* 

In the real world, Jess leaped for her sister and tried to swat her hand away. Just before she could, Mia closed her eyes. Her palm had rested on the Monolith for two seconds. 

It had been enough. She had looked away. 



The strange, twisted rune flashed purple and the light exploded outwards, a massive shockwave sending snow flying. Mia hurtled back a few feet like a ragdoll, as if a massive force had slammed into her chest, propelling her backwards through the air at such a speed that she crashed into a bent tree with a resounding *thwack*. 

Jess ran to her sister, who sat limply against the base of the tree with her legs and arms spread. 

Jess screamed “Are you okay?” more times than anyone could count. She held her sister’s head up, blood seeping from Mia’s nose and onto Jess’ hand. Her eyes opened again, vision swimming and hazy. She lethargically swept the blood from her nose, though she only succeeded in smearing it across her left cheek and hand. Jess, amid many concerned thoughts, grabbed her sister’s arm and positioned herself under her sister’s shoulder so as to support her. She got up, supporting Mia, and they began to walk– or rather, hobble– back towards the cabin. Mia had to be saved. Again.

In the heart of the snowy forest, an ancient creature stirred and–for the first time in millennia– opened its eyes. It smelled something primal, a metallic scent that permeated the air and it stank of iron and copper. It knew this scent all too well, it could even taste it on the tip of its tongue. The savory stench of fear. The creature growled and bellowed as its joints popped back into place. It stood, unbothered by the cold. As it rose, so did a great tower in the North, forged from the blackened ashes of a forgotten yesterday. The creature’s breath did not fog, nor did its antlers form icicles. Deep inside, a yearning formed, a deep desire. Looking to the horizon, which was obscured by the pines, it saw wisps of morning light.	It was a fine morning for a hunt.



Caleb’s boots crunched through the snow as he slowly trudged back to the cabin, his breath fogging in the cold. He wiped his face with a gloved hand, smearing fresh blood across his pale forehead. The smear was partially covered by his scraggly, messy black hair as he walked. The path ahead seemed impossibly long, as though he were walking down a runway with a destination as unreachable as the sun. 

The hunting rifle slung across his shoulder weighed him down like a ton of bricks. Looking up, he saw that the sun was directly above him. The trees cast no looming shadows at this hour. The slight warmth was a comfort, one of the few that remained, but that just made it taste all the sweeter. Caleb lethargically looked behind him every now and then, though he wanted it to be a much quicker motion. Each time he did, his heart rate jumped up noticeably. Every now and then, a droplet of blood fell into the snow underfoot, and the snow drank it eagerly, like a dehydrated man would drink from an oasis. Together, Caleb imagined that they might create an underground network of roots, but streaming out without veins to hold the blood. Looking to his left, he saw a bunny hopping around freely in the snow. It seemed delighted, its fur glistening in the midday sun. Was it looking for food? For a mate? No matter, Caleb thought as he snapped his head away from the rabbit. *Must keep pushing*. Yet he was so exhausted, like a puppet with its strings cut, stumbling forward with a hunched back and without lifting his feet. Then, like a miracle or divine intervention, the trees cleared.



Caleb could now see past the treeline, where a small cabin sat cozily in the clearing. The sky was peeled back like a fruit with its flesh bare and bright, and the smoke trailed off into it like it wished to replace the missing clouds. Caleb paused and glanced behind him one last time, yet nothing was there. Nothing but snow that had cried tears of red, at least. 

“Caleb!” Jess’ voice echoed through the trees as he entered the clearing. She put her steaming mug of tea aside and jogged up to him. Auburn locks flowed from under her gray beanie and onto her wool coat, her movement was elegant but unintentionally so. He’d always liked that about her, the way she effortlessly slipped into the role of his ideal woman. Her lips were a light pink instead of their usual vibrant color. Oh, how he’d love to kiss them again. Her eyes, wide as saucers, looked at him, then at his injured arm. 

“God, is that blood?” She asked as she examined the deep gash in his forearm. He saw it in her eyes, how caring she was. How many times had she cared for him when he wasn’t able to care for himself? 

“You should see the other guy.” An unimpressive attempt at humor as he was being dragged to the cabin by his good arm. She slammed the door open and a wave of heat wafted into Caleb’s face as he entered.

She hauled him inside, where it was unusually quiet. No Mia and no Jason. Strange. Not that Caleb minded their absence much, though he knew Jess wouldn’t at all be happy if he told her. A dinner table with six chairs stood to the right of the front door, though they only ever needed four. They rarely ate here. Instead, they preferred the couch by the front door, facing the fireplace along the left wall. Jess scooted a chair from under the dinner table, then sat Caleb down forcefully, placing his arm on the table, wound facing up. Jess disappeared into the bathroom, leaving him alone with nothing but his thoughts to accompany him. Was this trip here worth it? They’d come here with good intentions, he supposed, though the car ride had already been full of tension. God, how was the car now? He’d just left it in the parking lot like the idiot he was. Jess came back with her hands full. Caleb saw bandages, some Neosporin and other boxes he couldn’t quite make out. 

“Thanks,” Caleb said as he tried to take the stuff from her. Jess didn’t give anything to him, she just set everything down on the table and took out a cotton ball dipped in alcohol. As she tried to take his arm and treat him, he pulled back.

“Oh, for fuck’s sake Caleb you’re not Bear Grylls, give me your goddamn arm.” He did as she asked, though he raised an eyebrow and turned up his nose while doing so. The wound flared up with pain as Jess, admittedly quite aggressively, rubbed the soaked cotton ball into the deep gash, though Caleb took it with a smile anyway. After that, she quickly rubbed some cream onto the skin surrounding the wound and then got out a needle and thread. 

“Woah, isn’t that a little-” Caleb tried, putting his hand up, but Jess interjected, saying: “Shut up or I’m cutting it off.”

“Can’t hunt with one arm,” Caleb said with a smug grin.

“Who said anything about your arm? Besides, how much food have you brought back?” She joked, though with an awfully straight face. Pinching the wound together as if joining two cliffs, Jess stabbed the needle through and started stitching him up. Caleb winced, which finally made Jess’ lips give way to a smirk. 

“What?” He said more than asked.

“Nothing. Nothing at all,” Jess laughed, and Caleb found her teeth oddly beautiful. How could he? They were just teeth, though somehow they seemed all the prettier belonging to her.

“Tough guy,” She continued, her smile widening.

“Not this again.”

“Caleb the bear slayer, dying from a mysterious disease.”

“It was one time-” He tried, though Jess didn’t give him time to speak, “Not even his loving girlfriend could save him. Oh no, *the* mighty Caleb fell to the common cold.” Caleb closed his eyes and gave a half-hearted smile, then grunted at a particularly hard stab through his flesh. 

After Jess finished stitching his arm, she bandaged the wound, though she used too many for Caleb’s taste. As she went to place the bandages back onto the table,  her hand stopped and hovered above his. Caleb glanced up at her with a gleam in his eyes. Her expression darkened for a moment, then, as quickly as the moment had come, she withdrew and moved the supplies back to the bathroom. Goddamnit, Caleb thought. He thought it often, and he supposed that wasn’t a good thing, for when did you think or say dammit, if not when you screwed up?

“When do you think your sister’ll be back?” Caleb asked.

“I don’t know, could be a while.” *Thank God.* But no, he shouldn’t think like that. They did their part, or at least tried to. 

“You don’t think they’re.. You know?” Just as he asked this, Jess entered the main room of the cabin again, just in time for him to see the look of disgust on her face.

“Jesus Christ Caleb is that all you ever think about? They’re buying greens from Langford and gathering firewood for the meal *you* didn’t catch.” That struck a chord in Caleb. He liked that kindly old man who lived only about a half hour’s walk away from here, even if he was a tad strange. He got along well with Jason, less so with Caleb, which Caleb didn’t understand at all.

“Oh so it’s my fault a bear-”

“Shut it, Caleb. Not again.” And with that, the argument, if you could even call it that, came to a grinding halt.



Mia and Jason arrived just before the sun began to sink below the pines, casting the cabin in a soft amber light. The crunch of boots on the packed snow was the first thing Caleb heard, followed by Jason’s familiar drawl and Mia’s giggling. He’d recognize Jason’s voice anywhere; soft, heavily accented, full of attempted humor and as annoying as a mosquito buzzing around your ears at night.

“I don’t see no meat,” Jason called from the side of the cabin, his voice muffled as Caleb heard him deposit an armful of logs onto the pile. Caleb saw Jess stiffening beside him, her lips thinning into a tight line, her eyes shut before they opened and a fake smile plastered itself across her face. He understood her reaction, even if she chastised him for feeling the same way. Mia said something, though it was too quiet and soft for Caleb to hear. Their footsteps went around the back, stepped onto the porch, then the door creaked open and their voices became clearer as they stepped inside.

“Jess, ya left your coffee out on the porch again,” Jason teased, his head poking into the main room just as he set the mug down on the table Caleb was sitting at. His build was lanky and frail, his shoulders sloping downward as his eyes latched onto Caleb’s bandaged arm. His grin faltered and he raised an eyebrow, “The fuck happened to you?” 

Mia appeared a moment later, holding her hands together and her legs close against one another as she walked in and shut the door behind her. She froze mid-step when her gaze followed Jason’s. Her big brown eyes darted to Caleb’s bandaged arm, then to his face, then back to his arm, her eyes growing even wider. Before Caleb could answer, she shifted her weight and jabbed Jason in the ribs with her elbow.She shot a glance at Jason, who looked confused, then his face dropped slightly as he corrected himself.

“You alright? You want Mia to call an ambulance?” he asked, and Mia’s stern facade melted as a smile found itself on her face. She looked back at Caleb, though she was fidgeting with something in her pocket. Though she tried to hide it, she never had been any good at that. He grimaced, lifting his bandaged hand in a small wave, the gesture as hollow as the smile he tried to force. “It’s fine,” he said, “nothing serious.”

Jason leaned forward, inspecting the bandage. “Fine, huh? Looks like somethin’ took a bite outta you. What was it?”

Mia shot him another look, sharp this time, and Jason held up his hands, feigning surrender. “What? I’m just askin’.” 

Sometime later, they all sat in front of the hearth. Jason and Mia had settled into a tangled heap on one end of the couch consisting of the two of them and half the blankets the group had brought with them, her head was nestled on his chest and his arm hung loosely around her. Caleb and Jess sat apart, each sitting on a separate couch, not having spoken a word to each other in two hours.

Jason poked at the fire with a fire poker, watching the embers spiral out of the fire and crackle into nothing. “So,” he said, breaking the silence, “you actually thought a bear was gonna back off just ‘cause you pulled out a rifle?”

Caleb clenched his eyes shut and grit his teeth, “Maybe if I hadn’t been alone..” he said as he shot Jason a glance, the orange glow of the fire mirrored in his eyes. The room grew even more quiet, but Jason either didn’t notice or pretended he didn’t. He shrugged with a grin, 

“I ain’t tryna be no bear’s breakfast.”

Mia chuckled softly, it tickled Jason as her breath flowed down his shirt. Nudging him with her shoulder, Mia spoke softly:“At least Jess patched you up,” her tone was light but her eyes flicked to her sister with a look Caleb couldn’t quite read. Envy? Thankfulness? Maybe he was reading too much into his old friend.

Jason nodded, his grin widening. “Got yourself a damn fine nurse there.”

Jess finally spoke, her voice quiet and her eyes fixated on a window, “No big deal.” Her lips curled upward in a faint smile, but her eyes stayed distant.

“Oh, don’t sell yourself short,” Jason quipped, sitting back with exaggerated ease. “I mean, sure, I coulda done it better, but—”

“We can’t survive on charred pasta, Jason,” Mia cut in, her smirk playful.

Jason placed a hand on his chest in mock offense. “Hey now, that was a *clulinary* experiment.”

Everyone chuckled, even Jess, though her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“You two are impossible,” she said, her tone caught somewhere between fondness and exasperation.



When the sun set over the peaks of the forest edge, the group sat a little closer together around the hearth and ate some canned goods they’d brought with them. They still had enough to last a few weeks, but it’d be a hell of a lot easier (and tastier) if Caleb could actually bring back some meat one of these days. It’d been a month and a half and yet the fruits of Caleb’s hunts were all of one singular rabbit, which had hardly been a meal. Canned goods would do for now though, so all was well. Mia nuzzled up to Jason, an amalgamation of blankets draped around the both of them and each of them had a glass of clear, cold water in front of them. For all that Caleb’s hunting was good for, at least he’d brought a water purifier. 

The fire crackled softly, sending gentle pops of embers into the air as the group settled into a moment of comfort, the tension from earlier melting away at the heat of the fireplace. Though the canned goods were unappetizing, hunger had a way of dulling the senses to the tinny taste of beans and vegetables. Caleb leaned back, staring into the flames, the orange glow casting deep shadows across his face. He was chewing slowly, lost in thought, probably thinking about how he’d just had his own little *Revenant* moment. He, however, was no Leonardo Dicaprio and even he knew that.

“You know,” Jason said, pushing his half-eaten can of beans aside, “if I knew we was gonna be survivin’ on canned food for this long, I’d have brought somethin’ better than this. Spaghetti-O's, maybe.” He smirked, but it was more of an attempt to break the silence than genuine humor. Rolling her eyes, Jess spooned another mouthful of beans into her mouth. “You still think we’re living in luxury, don’t you?” 

“I don’t think Spaghetti-O’s are much of a luxury,” Jason said somewhat somberly.

“A bear would feed us for weeks,” Caleb said, stretching and crossing his arms behind his head. 

“Don’t much fancy bear jerky,” Jason muttered under his breath before coughing awkwardly and looking towards Caleb, “besides, you’d need to actually kill it,” Silence hung in the air, “they’ll eat you alive, y’know. Tear into ya without even bothering to kill you first.” Mia visibly cringed, pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders as she leaned closer to Jason. 

“You just had to say that, didn’t you?” Jess’ eyes bore into Jason’s and he glanced away in shame. He gave a hollow chuckle, “Just givin’ you the facts.”

“You’re giving her nightmares,” Jess shot back, narrowing her eyes at him. “You always do this.” 

Mia let out a soft sigh, resting her head against Jason’s shoulder. “He’s not wrong, though. Bears are scary. I don’t know what I’d do if we ran into one out there.” 

“If it’s black, fight back and all that,” Jason said more to himself than anyone else.

Caleb finally blinked, shaking off whatever thoughts had been clouding his mind. “It looked more like it was trying to get away from something, until it saw dinner at least.” He poked at the fire with the fire poker, sending a flurry of sparks into the air. “I don’t know, maybe I’m just tired.”

Jason snorted. “You’re always tired. Maybe you’re seein’ things. Maybe it was just a big moose or somethin’.”

“I don’t see things,” Caleb’s voice was sharp enough to cut the conversation short. He immediately regretted it, sinking back into his seat. “I just– I don’t know, nevermind.”

Placing her spoon down, Jess turned to face him fully, her expression softening. “You’re not crazy. We trust you, Caleb. If you say something’s up, we’ll be careful. Won’t we, Jason?” 

Jason shrugged but nodded, not wanting to push Caleb further. “Yeah, yeah.”

Mia’s hand tightened around Jason’s arm. “I hope it’s nothing worse.”

A soft laugh echoed through the cabin, coming from Jess of all people, though it lacked the warmth of her actual laugh. “Worse than a bear?”

A heavy silence fell over them, like a blanket of stone pinning the conversation down. The flickering fire was the only sound for a while. 

“It’s probably dead by now,” That seemed to calm the tension somewhat,so Caleb continued, “Or half-blind at the very least.”

Jason picked up his can again, shaking it to see if there was anything left. “Sure thing, boss. But for real, next time? I’m bringin’ a steak.”

They sat there for a while longer, the tension easing slightly as the fire danced and crackled. The air outside had grown colder, the wind howling softly through the trees. Caleb’s eyes flicked to the window, scanning the dark treeline.

“I think I’ll keep watch tonight.”

Mia frowned. “You should sleep.”

“I’m fine. Just… go to bed. I’ll wake one of you if anything happens.” They all knew who he’d wake, but she was staring off into space again. Jason soon went to his and Mia’s room, but not before speaking one last time, “If you see a giant moose, call me.” He offered a lopsided grin, though it quickly faded when Caleb didn’t respond and failed to even meet his eyes. 

*God, what did I do to deserve this?* Caleb had been having more thoughts like that lately, they seeped into his mind like pests in your walls, refusing to budge unless you physically threw them out. Many days, he didn’t feel like doing so as it required too much energy. Those were dark days.

Darker days were ahead.  Far, far darker days.

Jess stood up, finally looking away from the window, “Go with Jason, Mia. I’ll make sure Caleb doesn’t fall asleep standing up.” Mia nodded, hesitating a moment before giving Caleb a worried glance. “Be careful.” 

He gave her a small nod, though his eyes remained fixed on the forest beyond. Jess stepped closer to Caleb. She leaned against the wall next to him, arms crossed, watching him as he stared into the night. 

“You said it yourself, it’s probably dead,” she spoke softly, her voice almost drowned out by the wind outside, “we’ll be fine, Caleb.”

Caleb set his jaw, “I just don’t want to take any chances.”

Sighing, Jess told him words that she knew would cut deep. “You’ve always been like this. You don’t have to, you know we can handle ourselves. You’re allowed to rest too.” 

Caleb glanced at her, glassy eyed. Those words were a remix of those spoken to him on that fateful night. The night he lost her. 

The fire’s hot embers floated around the fireplace, heating the entire cabin up. Outside, the wind howled through the trees, sending a chill into the air. The current swept leaves away and carried them far beyond the forest’s edge. Critters and small animals like squirrels crawled around just barely out of sight, but they were still audible even through the cabin’s walls. Caleb stood by the window, his arms crossed tightly over his chest as he peered into the darkness. The treeline loomed like a jagged wall against the night sky, and his heart lurched each and every time he thought of that damned bear.



In another room, Jason and Mia tried their hardest to get a good night's rest. 

“You okay?” Jason asked from beside her, his brow furrowed in concern. They pressed against each other in the single bed, as there were only two beds in the entire cabin and the sisters had claimed both, citing their status of the fairer sex as enough of a reason for their occupying of the cozy beds. Jason was allowed to be next to Mia because of his status as her partner. Caleb slept on the couch because of his status as nobody’s anything. Mia’s eyes were glossy and darted around the room whenever she heard even the slightest creak of the old wood.

“I— I don’t know, Jason. What if it’s out there?” she whispered, her voice trembling as she gripped the edges of her blanket tightly.

Jason forced a calmness into his voice as he tried to reassure Mia. “It’s just the wind. Nothin’s out there, don’t you worry yourself.” His tone was steady, as was his breathing. His calm breath always helped her to calm down as she matched her breathing to his. Even so, she was still afraid. Before she knew it, Jason had placed his hands on her shoulder and back and started massaging her through her pyjamas softly. “Remember what we talked about? Whatever happens, we’re in this together. You’re safe here.” His arm wrapped around her waist while he continued to massage her with the other hand and she felt instantly more at ease, yet thoughts still lingered at the forefront of her mind. Thoughts of being flayed by a bear, to her, no death seemed quite so vile as that. Mia took in a shaky breath, trying to focus on Jason’s presence. “What if it followed him?”

“Bears don’t come ‘round cabins unless they smell food. Good food, not musty Caleb.”

“Unless they’re really hungry,” Mia added, her lips drawing into a slight smile. Seeing that smile on her face made Jason feel warm inside, like when he downed one pint after the other.

Before Jason could respond, a low, guttural growl reverberated through the night air. The cabin was still, the sound had cut through the wind like a knife. 

Jess jolted awake. She jumped out of bed, her heart pounding at her ribs, threatening to leap out at any moment. She crept towards the door and quietly opened it. In the main room, she saw Caleb holding his rifle, the butt resting against his upper chest. Jason and Mia crept out of their room, eyes wide with fear as they saw Jess and Caleb.

“Did ya hear that?” Jason whispered, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Yeah,” Jess replied, her stoicism slipping as her breath quickened. She glanced at the front door, her body tense, every instinct screaming at her to move. “We need to stay quiet.”

Mia whimpered softly, the sound barely audible. “What if it comes in? What do we do?”

Jason squeezed her shoulder, trying to keep his voice steady. “It won’t, don’t you worry. Just breathe, Mia.”

Another growl echoed, closer this time, followed by the sound of heavy footsteps crunching through the snow. Something was there. Something more than everyday fears, more than a rabid dog or a wolf. Jess’s heart pounded in her chest as she pressed her back harder against the wall, instinctively reaching for a fire poker resting nearby.

“Shh,” she whispered, raising a finger to her lips. She looked just as calm and collected as Caleb, save for the trembling fingers she held the fire poker with. The three of them huddled close, their breaths shallow and rapid, as they strained to hear. Caleb peered out through the window and saw a strange, bright light flash from somewhere beyond the trees. It seemed to be at around eye level, the light cold and uninviting.

“What the–” The light blinked off, cut off as abruptly as their quiet, cozy night had. The others looked at him with raised eyebrows, then their expressions turned to those only seen in war movies. Eyes wide with fear, they were looking just beyond him and out of the window. The terror felt more real now, as if only now they realized the gravity of the situation. There, on all fours, it sniffed the air and tried to follow their scent. It stood mere feet from the door, prancing about the exterior of the cabin. It had followed the blood trail.

The grizzly trotted, massive and hulking, its fur dark and shimmering in the moonlight. It sniffed the air, its wet, slimy nostrils flaring as it padded cautiously further toward the cabin. The creature was a terrifying sight, its left eye reflecting the firelight as it prowled closer, the sound of its claws scraping against the ground sending chills down Jess’ spine. The thing’s right eye socket and the fur around it were stained a dark crimson, the eyeball destroyed completely, what remained of it clung to its fur like a lifeline. 

“Oh God,” Mia gasped, pressing her face into Jason’s arm. “Caleb?”

“Quiet,” Jess’ voice was an authoritative whisper that commanded their respect. The bear’s movements were slow, its gaze scanning the area as it drew nearer. 

Jason wrapped an arm around Mia, his heart racing but trying to keep her calm. 

“You got him good.” Jess told Caleb and he grinned at that. It was a stressed grin, one that screamed that yes, he was proud but he would also very much like to get out of here.

The bear stopped at the window, sniffing the air again. “It can smell the food,” she whispered urgently, her mind racing. “Is there any–”

“Don’t move,” Caleb said, his voice low and firm, as he grabbed Jess by the arm. She looked at him, her look one of anger but weirdly enough he thought he saw a hint of thankfulness in her eyes. “This aint Jurassic Park, Caleb!” Jason hissed as the bear’s eye landed on Caleb and its snout perked up, it bared its teeth at him as it shifted its weight onto its hind legs. It roared mightily, seemingly moments away from throwing its full weight at the wall separating it from them. 

Then, as if an intervention from God, the bear’s ears perked up, and it turned its head sharply to the left as its eyes narrowed. It had caught the scent of something else in the air. The wind shifted, carrying a strange rustling sound from the forest, and they all took that moment to run back towards the room furthest from the bear; Jess’ room. Caleb was the last to enter and he hesitated, looking back at the bear. He watched as something, accompanied by a loud crashing noise, erupted from the trees, echoing through the night. Jess pulled Caleb into the room and closed the door behind them. Branches snapped, and something collided with the bear, sending it stumbling back into the snow. The bear let out a furious roar and an angry grunt of surprise as it hauled itself up and ran away from there at a great speed. 

“What was that?!” Mia sobbed, fear evident in her voice. 

“Something scared it off,” Caleb said, his voice a mixture of awe and fear. 

The bear’s roaring in the distance slowly faded away as it got further and further from them.  Jess let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding, her heart pounding in her chest. She turned to look at Jason, who had completely wrapped himself around Mia, so as to protect her from all the dangers of the world. He held her there as she drenched his shirt in tears and snot. 

“Goddamn moose,” Jason half heartedly laughed, but none of the others seemed to have heard his comment. The silence that followed the bear’s departure was heavy and charged with a dread that none of them could quite place. They should be glad, right?

A God had interfered that day, though they did not yet know what it was that Caleb’s fear had awoken.",1,1739893743.0,u_M_Sterlin,0,1.0,False

1isfozk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1isfozk/scored_a_brand_new_stickley_coffee_table_for/,Scored a brand new Stickley coffee table for cheap ($600 vs $4000 MSRP) but with a catch - it has a misglued/separated seam on the table top. Best way to arrest and fill it?,"Alright, I think I did pretty good here...scored a Stickley oak Highlands coffee table for $600 at the local outlet. ""MSRP"" - for what it's worth - is about $4000 on the table. It's oak, stained in their ""Onondaga"" finish shown here: [https://www.stickley.com/products/32](https://www.stickley.com/products/32) . Beautiful, solid, heavy table, I love it ESPECIALLY for the price.

The catch - it has a pretty good separation at one of the glue seams, direct center of the table top. Hoping that I can at minimum fill it and sort of match the existing finish, and in a perfect world, arrest any further spreading. I don't think there's any real way I'd clamp and close the gap given the location, so I think filling it is the best approach. Pics are attached.

Dimensions of the separation are about 5"" long with about 1/32"" of separation at the max point. My thought was to lightly and carefully sand inside the joint, clean and dry as best as possible, then tape along two sides (bottom, side edge) and fill with a needle point syringe with epoxy. I'm picturing going very slowly, until the epoxy fill is just flush with the top edge of the table. Also hoping that using a dark brown epoxy color will render it mostly unnoticeable.

Here are my questions for those of you who are more experienced than I.

* Is the above plan sensible?
* What epoxy do you recommend, and what coloring if any? Just try and match the stain?
* I've never used epoxy with wood before, but have certainly used plenty of 2k epoxys and paints on other projects. What don't I know, that I need to before starting? Is there a special tape to use here for easy removal after epoxy setting, and to prevent bleed through?
* Do you think I need to mechanically fasten the two separating boards via butterfly/bowtie/strap/whatever from underneath, else it will just continue splitting? Butterfly/bowties are probably a bit over my head at this point in the woodworking world, but I'm mechanically inclined and very handy with metalworking (have mill, lathe, can weld and fabricate, etc)

Impart thee collective wisdom on me, I implore you! Or alternatively, just laugh at my mistake paying good money for a cracked table :)

yesterday i asked if somebody could cover my shift because i was feeling sick. now i am physically sick with what i assume is a virus, and i also live in a state that is very cold right now (like its currently -13 out) and this has caused my fibro to really flare up.

my boss texted me privately and asked if anything is going on because it seems like i’m “sick every couple of weeks”. i then told her that i was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia after dealing with chronic pain for years. i also mentioned that during my job interview i had mentioned that i had recently been bedridden due to chronic pain. 

she responded and said she had no recollection of me ever saying i had been bedridden due to chronic pain and that maybe this job isn’t for me. 

now, this just made me feel really shitty because my boss herself has cancer and i would assume she would be more understanding of pain and illness, and instead just being told to basically find a new job really hurt. 

i really care about my job and the money is really good. i’m still going to work my shift today, it just sucks so much. i only asked if somebody could cover my shift because we’d been told during a staff meeting to ask ahead of time if somebody could cover if we felt like we probably wouldn’t be able to make it through our scheduled shift, and i did just as i was instructed to.

Major programs like the F-35 have spiraled into cost overruns, and the VA has lost billions through mismanagement.

Similarly, healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid have seen tens of billions lost through improper payments and outright scams. Fraud, poor oversight, and outdated processes have allowed waste to flourish, with billions of taxpayer dollars slipping through the cracks. Cutting the red tape and streamlining these agencies might not be a popular stance, but doing so could free up massive resources to better serve national priorities and reduce our long-term debt.

Here’s a quick list of some official sources backing up these claims:

* [**GAO DoD Audit Report**](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105052) – Shows how the Pentagon struggles with tracking its assets and fails audits, which points to big inefficiencies and potential waste.
* [**DoD Inspector General**](https://www.dodig.mil/) – This site features reports on issues like the Air Force overpaying for spare parts and other contract mishaps.
* [**HHS Office of Inspector General**](https://oig.hhs.gov/) – Offers data on billions lost in improper payments and fraud in Medicare and Medicaid.
* **U.S. Department of Labor OIG** – Contains investigations into fraud and mismanagement in unemployment benefits.
* [**SBA Office of Inspector General**](https://www.sba.gov/offices/oig) – Provides reports on fraudulent activities in small business relief programs like PPP and EIDL loans.
* [**VA Office of Inspector General**](https://www.vaig.gov/) – Covers audits on how the VA has mismanaged funds, with millions or even billions unaccounted for.

1isfdq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1isfdq5/how_kilimanjaro_shapes_local_communities/,How Kilimanjaro Shapes Local Communities,"When I first heard about Mount Kilimanjaro, I was amazed by how big and beautiful it is. But what I didn’t know is that Kilimanjaro plays a huge role in the lives of the people who live around it. 

It’s not just a mountain to climb, it’s also a place that shapes the communities.

# Kilimanjaro as a Source of Income

One of the biggest ways Kilimanjaro helps local communities is by providing jobs. There are many people who work as guides, porters, and cook staff for the people climbing the mountain. 

When I climbed, I met many guides who helped us get to the top safely. They told me that guiding tourists up Kilimanjaro is a big part of their income. Without tourism, many of these people wouldn’t have a way to earn money for their families.

The porters are also super important. They carry all the gear for climbers, like tents, food, and water. It was amazing to see how strong they were! 

They work hard to make sure climbers like me have everything we need while climbing. The money climbers pay to [climb Kilimanjaro](https://www.easytravel.co.tz/mount-kilimanjaro/) helps these workers support their families and improve their lives.

# Agriculture and Water Supply

Kilimanjaro’s forests and water sources are another way the mountain helps local communities. The mountain is home to several rivers that flow down into the farms and villages around it. These rivers are very important because they provide fresh water for drinking and for growing crops. 

People who live near Kilimanjaro grow things like bananas, coffee, and vegetables. Without the water from the mountain, these farmers would have a much harder time growing food.

When I visited a farm near Kilimanjaro, I could see how important the mountain’s water is for the crops. It was cool to see how the mountain helps feed people in nearby villages, and it reminded me how connected everything is. Kilimanjaro provides not just a place to visit, but a way of life for many local families.

# Cultural Significance

Kilimanjaro is also a very special place in the local culture. The people who live near the mountain, especially the Chagga people, have a deep connection to it. They believe that the mountain is sacred and holds a lot of meaning for them. Some families have lived near Kilimanjaro for hundreds of years and see it as part of their identity.

I learned that the Chagga people have special stories and traditions tied to the mountain. For example, they often use the mountain’s natural beauty and resources for ceremonies and celebrations. It’s amazing to see how Kilimanjaro is not just a mountain for tourists but a place that is part of the culture and beliefs of the people who live around it.

# The Challenges of Protecting Kilimanjaro

Although Kilimanjaro helps local communities in many ways, it also faces some challenges. One of the biggest challenges is conservation. The mountain’s environment is fragile, and if it is not taken care of, it could affect the people who depend on it. For example, the glaciers on the summit are melting, and the forests are shrinking, which could make it harder for people to get water or grow crops in the future.

When I climbed Kilimanjaro, I noticed that the guides and porters always made sure to respect the environment. They taught me to leave no trash behind and to be careful not to disturb the plants and animals. I realized that tourism on Kilimanjaro, if done the right way, can help protect the mountain, but it also requires the help of everyone, including tourists like me.

# Why a Guide Makes It Easier

As I mentioned, having a guide when climbing Kilimanjaro is really important. Not only does a guide know the best routes and help you stay safe, but they also share valuable knowledge about how the mountain shapes the local communities. My guide told me all about how the people living around Kilimanjaro have adapted to life near the mountain and how they use the resources from it to live.

If I had tried to climb without a guide, I would have missed out on so much of the local knowledge that made the climb even more special. A guide can also help you understand the cultural and economic importance of Kilimanjaro, making the experience feel even more meaningful.

# Kilimanjaro’s Future and Its People

As Kilimanjaro continues to inspire climbers and provide for local communities, it’s important for everyone to help protect it. The people who live near the mountain depend on it for water, crops, jobs, and cultural traditions. Without Kilimanjaro, their lives would be very different.

When you visit Kilimanjaro, remember that you’re not just climbing a mountain; you’re also supporting the communities that rely on it. Whether you’re buying local souvenirs, hiring a guide, or just respecting the environment, you’re helping make sure that Kilimanjaro continues to support the people who live there.

Climbing Kilimanjaro is an amazing adventure, and it’s even more special when you know how it shapes the lives of so many people. It’s a reminder that mountains are not just beautiful places; they are living, breathing parts of the world that help communities thrive.",0,1739892840.0,backpacking,0,0.5,False

I am a mixed race child of immigrants to the US. My family lived the American dream. 

I graduated a military academy and joined the military as an officer in large part because I felt like I needed to give back to this country for the opportunities it provided my family. 9/11 was a defining moment in my childhood and set me on the path towards military service. I was also inspired by my grandfather joining the fight against Imperial Japan as a very young teen. 

I started the process of preparing to get accepted to the academy at 16. I studied political science and American foreign policy. I spent a total of eight years between the active and reserve components. While in the reserve, I worked in public safety because I wanted to help my fellow American. I spent my entire youth in the service of the American people.

I have dead friends from military suicide and training incidents. I live with the guilt of losing soldiers. I have patched up gunshot wounds on children on the streets of the good ole USA. My best friend fought with the Kurds in Syria only to have Trump betray them. I worked as a firefighter/medic through COVID where my ambulance might as well have been a hearse for a ""made up"" pandemic. My best friends and I all have varying levels of PTSD from public safety or combat deployments. 

We all believed in America. We all believed in democracy, the Constitution, and equality for all regardless of their identity or creed. We believed in the relationships our nation had with Canada, Europe, and our other allies. We all hoped for progress and to make, ""a more perfect union.""

These days I read about government officials setting up camps for undesirables and can't help but think of the tours I went on as a schoolboy at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles where I spoke with survivors. I can't help but think of the families like mine who were kept in horse stables at the Santa Anita racetrack and then sent to Manzanar for being Japanese while the all Japanese 442nd RCT racked up medals fighting fascism in Europe. 

I can't help but think of the countless black and brown Americans who faithfully served a country that hated them. I remember in college when colleagues referred to me as one of the ""good Asians,"" all while forgetting men like Senator Inouye in WWII and Major Kurt Chew-Een Lee in Korea. Look those men up.

Today I watch my county fall into darkness, despotism, ignorance, and selfishness. I fear the world my son will grow up in. He's brilliant, innocent, and cares immensely of others. What kind of world, what kind of America will he grow up in? 

Fuck Trump, fuck President Musk, and fuck the spineless fucks that enable them.

I had a shitty morning and have been feeling a bit meh about myself and my weight recently. So I decided to start the day with a walk and to be more mindful of my eating for the next few weeks. I decided to walk to my local coffee shop and get a healthy coffee for my walk.

Once I got there, I ordered a Skinny Flat White, which normally I get a regular or an Oat flat white which I know are a good few more calories. 
I also refrained from getting any sweet things because of the aforementioned “mindful eating”.
So then Im standing waiting for my coffee to be made, and 2 other girls are beside me waiting for theirs. 

The barista finishes making one coffee and says “Regular flat white” to the crowd of us waiting. I didn’t move. 

But nobody else claimed it. Then she asked us each what we were getting. Obviously I said skinny flat white, and she said she had that was the next order… but Nobody else seemed to have ordered a regular flat white because nobody was claiming it.

So, everyone including the barista looked at me as if to be like “just take the regular flat white or it will be wasted”. 

I didn’t say anything though, because I didn’t see why I should have to. And one of the girls sort of huffed and was like “well someone should take it” like a clear dig at me. 

And this went on for about 3 minutes the barista kept asking if anyone wanted it. And the girls kept saying they would take it but they had ordered oat coffees or americanos.

But I specifically didn’t want a full fat flat white and I didn’t want to give in. It felt like they were trying to bully me into taking it. 

So I declined and then the barista went about making my skinny flat white but gave it to me with an angry glare that made me feel like I was so selfish and I left with basically my tail between my legs.

I just know they were hating on me after I left but I still don’t think I should have to take the regular coffee just because the barista made a mistake. AITA?",72,1739892639.0,AmItheAsshole,47,0.81,False

Split between French Saint-Martin in the north and Dutch Sint Maarten in the south, this tropical paradise combines European sophistication with laid-back Caribbean charm.

# Pristine Beaches

The island’s coastline is dotted with 37 stunning beaches, each with its own character. Orient Bay, often called the “St. Tropez of the Caribbean,” stretches along the French side with powdery white sand and crystal-clear waters perfect for water sports. For a more secluded experience, Happy Bay offers a hidden gem accessible by a short hike, rewarding visitors with pristine shores and excellent snorkeling opportunities.

Maho Beach on the Dutch side provides a unique attraction: planes landing at Princess Juliana International Airport fly so low over the beach that visitors can almost touch them. Meanwhile, Mullet Bay offers gentle waves ideal for beginning surfers and families.

The French side of St. Martin is a gastronomic paradise, particularly in Grand Case, known as the culinary capital of the Caribbean. Here, elegant restaurants serve sophisticated French cuisine with a Caribbean twist. The true stars, however, are the authentic French bakeries scattered throughout the northern half of the island. Every morning, the aroma of fresh croissants, pain au chocolate, and crusty baguettes wafts through the streets of Marigot, the French capital.

Local patisseries like Sarafina’s in Marigot offer perfectly flaky pastries that transport you straight to Paris. Don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy a morning coffee with fresh-baked goods while watching the world go by from a café terrace.

# Two Nations, One Island

The dual heritage of St. Martin creates a fascinating cultural tapestry. The French side maintains a distinctly European atmosphere, with its capital Marigot featuring charming colonial architecture and open-air markets. The Wednesday and Saturday markets are particularly popular, offering local spices, fresh produce, and handcrafted items.

Cross the border to the Dutch side (a transition so seamless you might miss it), and you’ll find yourself in a more commercialized atmosphere. Philipsburg, the Dutch capital, features duty-free shopping along Front Street and numerous casinos, adding a dash of Vegas-style entertainment to your Caribbean getaway.

# Practical Tips

* The island accepts both euros and dollars, though each side prefers its own currency
* No passport is required to cross between sides
* Peak season runs from December to April
* Consider renting a car to explore both sides thoroughly
* Many restaurants on the French side close during low season (May-November)
* The French side tends to be quieter and more expensive, while the Dutch side offers more nightlife and entertainment options

Whether you’re seeking French sophistication, Dutch liveliness, or simply want to lounge on some of the world’s most beautiful beaches, St. Martin offers a Caribbean experience unlike any other. The island’s dual personality ensures that every traveler finds their perfect vacation rhythm, whether that’s sipping espresso at a French café or dancing the night away at a Dutch beach bar. Having just returned from St. Martin, I can personally attest that this Caribbean Island offers a unique travel experience where visitors can explore two distinct cultures on a single island.

I'm in year 5 and have unlocked everything so am finally thinking about use of space beyond my moneymakers at the main farm (greenhouse full of ancient fruit). I use Aurora for coffee, tea, and grape wine, with kegs inside. Grandpa's shed is where I keep my casks, and also use the above space for any random crops I need since I'm still working on perfection with relationships and recipes. I'll probably put more ancient fruit up there once I hit perfection. Currently have fruit trees on the island, but not married to that. The two other farms and the Ridgeside greenhouses?

I would like some customizability of my coffee cup so that I can learn more. I think this in itself takes the Bosh one off the table.

However, I was unable to find meaningful information on the Ariete machine, so I'd love to hear from you guys.

Then took my immersion blender and liquified a bunch of watermelon and strained it into empty water bottles; sadly it's far too red to drink today. I did take a tiny sip - quite delicious so will drink tomorrow after the procedure to replace electrolytes.

I graduated a military academy and joined the military as an officer in large part because I felt like I needed to give back to this country for the opportunities it provided my family. 9/11 was a defining moment in my childhood and set me on the path towards military service. I was also inspired by my grandfather joining the fight against Imperial Japan as a very young teen. 

I started the process of preparing to get accepted to the academy at 16. I studied political science and American foreign policy. I spent a total of eight years between the active and reserve components. While in the reserve, I worked in public safety because I wanted to help my fellow American. I spent my entire youth in the service of the American people.

I have dead friends from military suicide and training incidents. I live with the guilt of losing soldiers. I have patched up gunshot wounds on children on the streets of the good ole USA. My best friend fought with the Kurds in Syria only to have Trump betray them. I worked as a firefighter/medic through COVID where my ambulance might as well have been a hearse for a ""made up"" pandemic. My best friends and I all have varying levels of PTSD from public safety or combat deployments. 

We all believed in America. We all believed in democracy, the Constitution, and equality for all regardless of their identity or creed. We believed in the relationships our nation had with Canada, Europe, and our other allies. We all hoped for progress and to make, ""a more perfect union.""

These days I read about government officials setting up camps for undesirables and can't help but think of the tours I went on as a schoolboy at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles where I spoke with survivors. I can't help but think of the families like mine who were kept in horse stables at the Santa Anita racetrack for being Japanese while the all Japanese 442nd RCT racked up medals fighting fascism in Europe. 

I can't help but think of the countless black and brown Americans who faithfully served a country that hated them. I remember in college when colleagues referred to me as one of the ""good Asians,"" all while forgetting men like Senator Inouye in WWII and Major Kurt Chew-Een Lee in Korea. Look those men up.

Today I watch my county fall into darkness, despotism, ignorance, and selfishness. I fear the world my son will grow up in. He's brilliant, innocent, and cares immensely of others. What kind of world, what kind of America will he grow up in?

I woke up a minute before my alarm, refreshed and ready to go. Usually I had trouble waking up, but this morning I felt energized. 

I got up and had a quick shower - the water stayed at exactly the right temperature the entire time. Then I got dressed - I actually felt good about how I looked in the mirror, for a change. After I had Miriam, I had trouble losing some of the baby weight and didn’t always feel good about myself. But today I felt confident, even sexy. 

I packed up Miriam’s things for daycare and got her to the car without a fuss - she didn’t even spit up on me, for once. As any single parent will tell you, that was a miracle in itself. 

In the way in, I stopped at my favorite coffee shop. They had my favorite morning coffee - a light roast breakfast blend, iced to beat the arid heat - and a ham and cheese croissant, just the way I like them. And it turns out the person ahead of me had already paid for me as part of a pay-it-forward line, and the person behind me only had a small plain black coffee. Score!

I got to the office and got a great parking space, right up near the front. Then I ran inside and got to my desk and booted up my computer a minute before my boss came by my desk. 

“Good morning, Melanie! I see that you’re in bright and early!”

“Absolutely, Mr. Jordan! Ready to make some customers happy.”

“That’s great to hear! By the way, I saw the final monthly numbers this morning - *someone* led the department in customer satisfaction rate. Keep up the great work!”

*Wow*, I thought as I watched him walk back to his office. Mr. Jordan wasn’t one to hand out praise easily. That was amazing!

And the day continued on like this - all of my calls were easy, with reasonable customers and issues I could resolve. My coworkers, even the most ornery ones, didn’t give me any grief. The deli in the lobby had my favorite soup and salad and it was on sale. And on and on. 

Then five o’clock came and my shift was over. I clocked out and headed to the parking lot, glad the workday was done and I could go home and relax. 

But as I got to the car, something felt off. I looked around the car - there were no dents or scratches, so no one hit me. The tires weren’t flat. I looked inside - the front seats were fine. Then I checked the backseat. 

And realized, as I saw a tiny foot sticking out of a car seat, that I didn’t ever remember stopping at the daycare center that morning. 

*MIRIAM!!*

**Disclaimer:** *Some of these inquiries are subjective and Revokat's (Nocturne and Idira's writer) opinions are his own and may not be reflective of ""The One True Canon""/Owlcat/Games Workshop.*

1. How did you get to write for Nocturne and Idira? Also, how did you get used to writing in iambic pentameter?

>""Cool, thanks for the questions! I got hired haha! Developing Nocturne as a character was one of my first work tasks. I was the one who suggested to write him in iambic pentameter, since I thought it would be a great fit for the Solitaire, and I liked Shakespeare back in school (I am a bit of a theatre kid). So I spent 1 or 2 days studying iambic pentameter, reading articles on how to write it, and studying bits from Romeo and Juliet. Then it was only a matter of finding the right metaphors and counting the syllables.""

[Idira on Nocturne being the type who knows a lot, but is frustratingly vague](https://preview.redd.it/igeuopewvwje1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=735e0d966e50a21583f0c0fe4b8cebe9a59fc0ba)

2. What was the process for writing whenever your characters had to interact with other characters with different writers? Do their writers get to brainstorm with you on how your characters and theirs would react to each other?

>""I’m afraid I can’t share specifics, ‘cause NDA and I don’t want to share too much. But I can say that the writing team is pretty tight-knit and we interact a lot during the development.""

3. Not a lot of Harlequin stories around (and most only have them as side characters), but have you read any other stories where they're involved? And if you did, which do you like best?

>""I’m afraid I only read the latest Harlequin codex for research, and maybe some tiny bits here and there. Any recommendations?""

*I proceeded to list him some, imo, good stories that have Harlequins in them (\*note that some of these may have old lore and books are done by different authors\*):*

https://preview.redd.it/2gntxhmrvwje1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=04570cb261c09bbfbff49356f53a7356ec61741c

* ***Path of the Dark Eldar***– recurring energetic and insightful **Solitaire** named **Motley** whose **thoughts and feelings are explored** more as he investigates Chaos activity in Commorragh (like his thoughts on the splintered subfactions), nuanced depiction of **Drukhari**, Motley being silly, Motley being serious, and Motley flirting
* ***The Masque of Vyle***– a novella that's part of the above, but **feels like it can act as a stand-alone**, also good if you want something **short**, Motley calls in a masque to help investigate Drukhari suspects behind the destruction of a Craftworld by spying and enacting a rendition of **the Fall that requires some... audience participation**
* ***Valedor***– if you want the **Craftworlders, Dark Eldar, and Harlequins in one story**, cited as one of the better Asuryani-centric novels, a silent Troupe Master (Harlequin King) and his masque, **Shadowseer Sylandri Veilwalker** (a recurring Veiled Path Shadowseer who's been influencing events for millenia in different novels and may or may not be one person), **The Dance Without End with a reappearance of a Solitaire from a previous novel**, wholesome moment of said Solitaire doting on twins, Troupe Master scares/excites/flirts
* ***Ahriman:Eternal***– rare depiction of **personal struggles of some Harlequins regarding identity/the self**, Harlequins as antagonists (against CSM), also highly rare depiction of a **Harlequin becoming a Solitaire in-story**
* ***The Fabius Bile Omnibus***– also Harlequins as recurring antagonists (again, also vs CSM) being trolls and steering the CSM to a specific story, Sylandri Veilwalker's reappearance, Veilwalker flirting, a bit of talk about the Shadowseer's sense of purpose and her thoughts on Cegorach's plans
* ***Faces***– I haven't read this short story, but I heard it was good. Characters try on special Harlequin masks and... things happen...
* ***Heirs of the Laughing God*** (***A Deadly Wit*** and ***Death's Mercy***), also part of *The Traitor and the Alien* audio drama collection– recent two-parter (2019-2020) with **Harlequins as main characters** (starring a **Troupe Master, Death Jester, and a Shadowseer**), highly character-driven, fully-voiced, **more intimate look at interactions between Harlies** and getting to hear their **differing individual thoughts, feelings, and opinions about each other, their roles, life, death, and other species like humans** while fighting, rare wholesome moment of a **Troupe Master (Duruthiel)** freeing imprisoned human slaves with no strings or backstabbings attached, they sound as theatrical as one expects, some Shakespearean references

1. Which of these does Nocturne favor: dramas, comedies, or tragedies?

>""There’s time and place for every genre. Only a tiny thread of string separates a comedy from a tragedy, and Nocturne walks it masterfully.""

5. Does he know of any ""mon'keigh theatre""/human literature/stories (ancient Terran or otherwise)? Does he like any of them? Would he have a favorite?

>""If he does, he hasn’t told me yet.""

6. It's remarkable that compared to Yrliet and Marazhai, Nocturne doesn't seem to be the type to express superiority over ""mon'keigh"" (he doesn't need to). And it's clear that he holds no interest in humans other than the Rogue Trader (whom he knows is the main character of the story at first meeting and ropes in his scheme), but what's his opinion on humans as a whole compared to the other two Aeldari?

>""Everyone is but an actor for him, no more, no less. Humans are no different, so it all depends on the current play he’s orchestrating. ""

7. Maybe I'm just basing it too much on his name and having read two instances of Harlequins becoming Solitaires in stories, but did Nocturne of Oblivion used to be a Death Jester before becoming a Solitaire?

>""He’s past is as much of a mystery to me, as it is to you. He showed what I needed to write the story, but everything else remained hidden behind the mask.""

 8. How does Nocturne eat/drink (which I guess is a question for Harlequins in general, but this is for Nocturne, specifically)??? Would recaf affect him at all?

>""I think that he just removes the mask, and… well… eats. He is still a creature of flesh and blood, albeit a very powerful one. Also, I don’t think he’s a coffee person.""

*Note from me, I remember two instances of Harlequins being unmasked: one is* ***Kyganil*** *from the* ***Daemonifuge*** *comics (he is a pariah and shows his face all the time, but it's never revealed why or how he was expelled, his story with human fellow outcast Ephrael Stern just skips to them reaching the Black Library and aiding some Imperials that hate them), and the other is* ***Mime Mistress Draillita*** *becoming a Solitaire in* ***Ahriman: Eternal*** *(although, her face isn't described, just an expression). I forgot if Lechthennian (Path of the Eldar and Valedor) and another Solitaire (Warhammer 40,000: Compendium (1989) were unmasked or if they were wearing disguises while going anonymously as seemingly ordinary people.*

9. I can recall about 3 times Harlequins being flirty in the 40K novels, but how aware are you about the Nocthirst? Since he's never meant to be romanceable, what would he be like if he was (aside from him having to travel away a lot)?

>""I’ve seen fanarts and read Reddit and Twitter, and also I’m good friends with a few fans from the community. So I’m very aware, yes 😅(and also very humbled and grateful!). As for what he would be like, one word: deadly. I’d prefer to leave it to your imagination. Solitaires are feared and revered for a reason, after all.""

*Nocturne could range from ""protective clusband"" to ""yandere Slaanesh"", let your imagination run.*

*And Revokat may be lurking right now, for all I know.*

10. I noticed there's a theme between Rogue Trader and the companions. All of them are outcasts in one way or another: Yrliet's lonesome Outcast path, Idira being an Unsanctioned Psyker, Argenta being separated from her Order, Ulfar also separated from his Chapter, Marazhai ousted from his Kabal, etc. It's as if the Rogue Trader collects fellow ""rogues"". Was this intended? It's a pretty neat bow to tie them together. Even Nocture is one with being a pariah as a Solitaire.

>""Tbh I’m the wrong person to ask since Olga Kellner is the mastermind behind the whole narrative and its key themes. Personally I think that companions in RPGs often fall into this trope one way or another since it’s compelling and often explains why they are traveling together. So I don’t know if it was a key theme of the game, but yes, they do have that in common.""

11. Oh! And do you have tips on writing Nocturne in-character while writing in iambic pentameter (and writing in iambic pentameter in general)?

>""As for tips, the key is thinking about what you want him to say, then find a good metaphor, and put it in verse. the general feeling I strive for is that when he kinda answers the question you are left with the feeling of 'okay, nice, but now I'm even more confused.' I'm not sure I can give any great tips on iambic pentameter except for count your syllables and mouth them aloud. If you're struggling with a line that seems cool but doesn't fit the rhythm, try to shelve it and come up with a different metaphor, or you might end up spend too much time struggling with it

>Also, he doesn't care if you understood him completely. To him everything he says is perfectly clear. He said what he said and won't clarify further unless he really wants you to understand something crucial.""

*vague, metaphorical, and doesn't make himself clear unless he feels like he really wants you to get what he says*

12. I know the reasons he didn't become a companion was because of changes during development and the other being power-level reasons (despite Rogue Trader and their party being able to do things and defeat enemies a Rogue Trader and their retinue wouldn't normally be able to, including defeating Nocturne himself). But, what would Nocturne be like as a companion who shows up every now and then?

>""It’s hard to say, since it never moved past the idea stage, there was no design or anything. He’d probably invite himself to our ship by the end of Chapter 4 along with other secret companions. And everyone would be very concerned. What could he talk about? A poetry battle? Trying to make him say at least one phrase not in iambic pentameter? Glimpses at the secrets of the Black Library? Who knows

>Feel free to share these answers with the community if you want!""

*And share I did, some time after I thanked him.*

**bonus on Nocturne's voice, I brought up Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta and Samuel Ramey (The Beast in Over the Garden Wall and the Phantom from Phantom of the Opera) while we were chatting:** 

>""As for the voice I think it would be something in between those two. I imagine it as deep and smooth, but not quite Samuel Ramey deep. A fun little fact: part of the reason I made him a baritone is ‘cause I’m a baritone myself and generally admire this timbre for its versatility (and of course because it fit the character, I’m not that vain, haha!)""

My wife and I did our **first-ever cruise** on Royal Caribbean’s **Explorer of the Seas**, and we decided to **upgrade to a balcony room**. Since this was our first time cruising, we weren’t sure what to expect—especially when it came to whether the extra cost was actually worth it.

After **7 days on board**, we’ve got some honest thoughts. If you’re considering booking a **balcony room in 2025**, here’s what we loved, what surprised us, and what we wish we knew **before** setting sail.

# The Good:

✅ **Waking up to the ocean every morning was unreal.** We didn’t spend a ton of time on the balcony, but sipping coffee while watching the sunrise was a highlight.  
✅ **More space than we expected.** The closet was actually a lifesaver—we fit two big suitcases, carry-ons, and camera gear without feeling cramped.  
✅ **Privacy was better than we thought.** Even with neighbors, the balcony dividers gave us a decent sense of separation.

# The Not-So-Good:

❌ **Hidden Costs** – We knew there would be gratuities, but we didn’t realize **$18 per person per day** was automatically charged. Add that to extra tips on drinks, spa services, and even coffee—it definitely added up.  
❌ **Older Ship Vibes** – Explorer of the Seas is 24 years old, and while clean and functional, the room felt more like a **dated hotel** than a luxury cruise cabin.  
❌ **The Sales Pitches** – The spa was great, but after the massage, it felt like a timeshare presentation with all the upselling. A lot of onboard activities had some kind of **“upgrade” option** attached.

Would we **book a balcony again?** Honestly… yes! Even though we weren’t out there all the time, it made the trip feel **way more relaxing and immersive**.

**What about you?** Do you always book a balcony, or do you think an interior room is just as good? Would love to hear your thoughts! 🚢",0,1739892064.0,royalcaribbean,18,0.38,False

1iseyxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1iseyxh/ooze_of_the_heart_pt_1/,Ooze of the Heart (pt 1),"""Cupid? And that's your real name?"" Hedge Rayland asked his newest patient, Devlin Cupid, a newly married man age 24, Tall, Average build, curly red hair, and seeking help with self-control. At least that's what it said on his patient application form he filled out a week prior.

Chuckling Devlin responded ""Yeah, it's real. I get that a lot. People just think I'm messing with em' given the hair and all."" He looked down at the oak coffee table at a half-drank cup of coffee that separated the two men as he finished his sentence.

Dr. Rayland's office had a warm venerable aspect to it, from the Victorian-style furniture to the posh lighting fixtures adorning the burgundy and emerald walls. Seeming out of time for the modern 1980s world they lived in. Rayland looked a man far out of his own age, only 33 he carried himself very properly with combed-back brown hair and a tidy mustache, a vest with a black blazer and an antique pipe he would puff on occasionally throughout his appointments. However the addition of Rayland's light Bostonian accent made for a contrasting persona, the voice not matching the face and all that. Devlin didn't quite know what to make of the man. 

""A fine name son, no worries of it, now what I like to do for first appointments is break the ice a little. I tell you something about me, you tell me something about you, so on and so forth. For instance, crosswords, I adore a good crossword in the morning, really gets the brain moving, y'know what I mean?"" Hedge said, giving Devlin a calming gaze, sitting in anticipation. 

Nothing, Devlin just sat there giving a blank-faced open mouth stare at the Dr.

With a wide-eyed grimace, Rayland leaned forward and gave a gesture of ""Okay now you go"" 

The red haired man's gears finally started cranking as he fumbled with his words ""Oh ugh yeah, I ugh, football, I like watching football"" 

""Ah, football very nice! A big sports fan!"" Rayland exclaimed, internally thinking ""Wow this guy is the real deal, a true bonafide dullard""

""Okay so you're a sports guy, I'm a words guy. How about you tell me what you do for work?"" Rayland inquired not wanting to drag this appointment out longer than he needed.

""I work down at Hemms, you know the chemical disposal plant near the Commonwealth flats, I ugh. Well you know I take out the old barrels and ugh. I put em in the trucks and the guys, they ugh they take em away."" Devlin stuttered out

""Oh disposal work, keeping the earth clean, very noble work my friend"" Rayland kept a very professional front but could not get this over with faster, he had spent the night prior with a slim, dark hair 25 year old he met down at Muse. Up until 3am, barely a drop of sleep and a hangover that could put a bear into early hibernation.

Wanting to get on with the appointment Rayland asks ""So I see you're having issues with impulse control? What exactly are these impulses of yours?""

Nervously Devlin responds ""Well you see doc, I ugh. Now haha now this is gonna sound just so out there, but it's about my ugh. My wife ya see."" Devlin pauses

""Your wife? Is there some kind of overzealousness you have with your wife in a sexual manner? You know that's pretty normal for newlyweds Mr. Cupid."" Rayland rebutted 

""Oh no no haha no it's nothing like that at all doc, I ugh ha we don't exactly do that"" visible uncomfortable Devlin adjusts himself in his chair.

""Hmm okay well what is it then?"" Rayland becoming more impatient with every interaction with Devlin and he fears his frustration is starting to show.

""Well you see, I want to kill my wife."" Devlin stated in a cool and collected time ""I want to cut her open and pull her heart right out of her chest."" The man's tone changed on a dime.

A chill runs up Rayland's spine as he stares at the coffee cup in front of him, wide-eyed, not quite sure if he should make eye contact, he just lets Devlin continue.

""I just love her so much doctor, I can't stand to see anyone even look at her, I want to take her away from this gawking world. Take her heart and put it in my pocket."" Devlin says, grasping at something invisible with his hand.

Finally looking up to the man Rayland finds his cold gray eyes staring directly at him. Another chill runs up his spine and into his head, rattling his brain with a shiver. A primeval desire to get the hell out of this room right now almost overtakes him. 

""N-now, why would you want to go and do that, Devlin?"" Stammered Rayland.

""Mr. Cupid if you don't mind, doctor."" Devlin stated plainly

""Oh, ugh, of course, sorry Mr. Cupid."" it seemed Rayland had the roles reversed on him and he felt like the scared bumbling idiot now. 

""Didn't you hear me before doctor? I love her."" A smirk crept up on Devlin's face as he spoke.

""That's what I'm not understanding here. Mr. Cupid, if you loved her, well why on earth would you want to take her life?"" Questioned Rayland.

""Wouldn't you do anything for the ones you love, doctor? She made vows to me, not to this vile world, not to these sick people. To me. I need to take her away from it all before it's too late.""
Again another overwhelming urge to flee washed over Rayland, fighting it back with all his will he sat planted and tried to keep his composure.

""But, why tell me any of this?"" Not knowing if he wanted the answer to that question or not

""Well, cause you killed your wife too, Dr. Wayland. Isn't that right?"" Asked Devlin ""You smothered her to death in her sleep, you're just like me"" giving a devilish grin.

""DONG"" The antique clock rang off signaling an end to the appointment.

""Well, that's our time!"" Rayland shot up and quickly hurried to rush Devlin out of the door.

""Oh, uh, oh already doc?"" Devlin's previous demeanor returned as the act of Rayland grabbing and rushing the man out.

""I am afraid so lad, all the time we have today"" hastened Rayland. 

""Oh uh, okay doc I uh I guess same time next week huh?"" Asked Devlin.

""Yes yes lad, same time, best be off now."" Rayland rushed 

""Okay bye d...."" Rayland slammed the door on Devlin before he could finish his sentence.

Turning quick the doctor rushed over to his cupboard and poured a stiff glass of gin, dowing the floral liquor Rayland took a deep gasping breath ""Fucking madman, crazy fucking psychotic madman!"" 

""You smothered your wife in her sleep."" The words rang in his mind. 
""Did I hear him right? Rayland? No Wayland!"" Rayland shouted. ""He got me confused for Duluth Wayland!"" Another practicing therapist Wayland had been in the news recently but only by name. Remembering the still active case from earlier in the year, the police suspected murder and Wayland was high up in the list of possible suspects.  

""I just got roped into some maniac's murderous delusion over mistaken identity!!!"" Rayland bent over with the anticipation of vomiting. 

""BZZZZZ!!"" The buzzer to Rayland's office went off and the door swung open, Chelsea Valenta, Rayland's 24 year old receptionist. Chelsea had been working for Rayland for the better part of three years now screening clients and collecting payments. She came marching in over to Rayland with a deeply concerned look on her pale face, her blue eyes peeking through her soft blonde hair with worry. 

""Okay that guy, what the hell is up with him? He just walked past and gave me the craziest stare down I've ever seen."" She said in a whispered yell.

""I need you to get the police on the line now, that guy can't be allowed to go home to his wife."" Rayland said, adjusting his coat in an attempt to compose himself. 

________________________________________________

""His wife?"" The Boston police officer asked 

""Yes, he said he wanted to cut her open!  I really don't think we should take a chance with this guy."" Rayland said as he poured himself another glass of gin

""And he just up and told you all this, for no reason?"" Questioned the officer 

""No, I think he thought I was Duluth Wayland, similar names, same job. I think he just got me confused with that guy and he thought I would relate to him?"" Rayland knew how it sounded and could tell he wasn't exactly getting through to the cop in front of him.

""Look, can you just go and check up on him? Make sure nothing is going on?"" Rayland pleaded 

""As soon as you called in we went to the guy's apartment but no one was home, we'll try his work tomorrow to see if we can catch him there and take him in for evaluation. You said the Hemms plant right?"" The officer gave a reassuring gesture to the disheveled man.

""Yes that's correct, just please find this guy. In all my years I've never seen a man so resolute in his own bullshit."" Rayland said, speaking through lighting his pipe.

""We'll be on it, Doc. I promise. Look you've had a rough day, just go home and try to get some rest, we'll keep you updated okay?"" The cop put his coat back on and slipped out of the office. 

""Yes, very good, thank you officer. I'll be hearing from you"" Rayland waved the cop off and closed up his office for the night. Laying in bed after nearly a whole bottle of 80 proof gin, Rayland tossed and turned trying to get some shut eye but knew none would come to him this night, or any night soon. His hands trembled by the day's happenings and opted to do some late night reading. He decided to finally finish off Lightning by Dean Koontz, he'd been a sucker for a good horror novel since he was a boy growing up in midtown. They had an oddly soothing effect on him, often sending him off to his own dream world before he could finish a chapter. Tonight was no different, a mere 10 words away from the chapter's end Hedge Rayland was in a restless slumber.

I *hate* these classes and I’m just generally burnt out from trying to complete this degree over the last few years while working full time. I can normally self-motivate if it’s a class I actually enjoy but I’m at a loss and keep falling further behind. I take medication and even if I start on task I’ll get quickly distracted with literally anything else that’s more interesting. It’s my last 2 classes for this degree and I really need to graduate and be done with this. 

Normally I’d do work elsewhere (coffee shop, library etc) and co-working in public works well for me but it’s extremely inefficient for these classes as I need multiple screens to go between spreadsheets and reference data. It would probably take me 3x longer fully focused. 

Any tips to force myself through the late coursework and get caught back up (and hopefully stay that way)?

-

**TLDR:** My mum’s emotional abuse and gaslighting have escalated since I set boundaries, including requesting family therapy. She’s weaponizing my brother’s pain, and he’s now begging me to reconcile with her. I’m heartbroken, overwhelmed with guilt, and questioning if I should just pretend everything is fine to ease his suffering. I feel isolated, powerless, and at one of the lowest points in my life. Advice or validation would mean the world.

-

Hi, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trapped, and I could really use some perspective. 

My relationship with my mum has been difficult, to put it lightly. At the beginning of the year it got to the point where I told her family therapy was the only way I would be open to trying to ""resolve things"". She refused at first, but when I stuck to my boundary on that being the only way I will engage with her, she agreed she would ""if that's what it takes"" & to let her know when & where, but stated she wasn’t happy about it. When I said I needed time to think about it, she replied ""this is what you wanted, and now you need time, I give up!”

I was hesitant as since I initially proposed therapy, her emotional abuse has escalated, & I don't believe she genuinely wants to change, she just wants to regain control. 

Last year, I went low-contact with her, only arranging visits with my brothers and taking them for days out instead of going round. This wasn't sustainable & eventually I resumed visiting them at home, initially not interacting with my mum. I found out my older brother (11) was suicidal, so I fought to get him help because my mum is neglectful, avoidant & was minimizing the situation. This was retraumatizing but I'm glad I was there & advocated for him. That’s when I resumed contact, which she mistook for reconciliation. I guess I went back to pretending everything was ok, albeit more boundaried.

Conflict was reignited at the beginning of the year as she pretended she didn't see my relationship status of my first same sex relationship. She admitted it, making it about how much it hurt finding out publicly. I said I might've told her if she responded better when I came out to her, as she basically asked why I was telling her and said I don't need to go round telling everyone. She denies ever saying that, that I misunderstood, she meant something else, etc. One message she sent was ""I don't give a shit what you are"".

When I next saw my brothers, my eldest brother was telling me that my mum doesn't care that I was with my ex & questioned me in such a way that parrotted my mum & triggered an emotional flashback.

Last week, my grandad told me to meet him for a coffee, which I was correct in thinking would be about my mum. He told me he was only getting involved now as my 11 year old brother has been crying himself to sleep every night over this. Bare in mind I have been parentified & my mum has been using weaponizing my siblings and trying to guilt trip me with them.

The next day my mum messaged me saying ""grandad told me you had a chat. I understand how you feel about the family therapy but obviously neither of us has the spare money to pay for it"" (I told my grandad I expect her to pay half & would get back to her with the fee, as I found a local service with a sliding-scale. I told him I pay for my own therapy but I didn't say I couldn't afford it-not to say that I can, but I would make it work) ""I really want to discuss things with you so we can resolve the situation as I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I reacted badly to you coming out. I really do think it's one big misunderstanding we can resolve by talking"" (again, I've explained it's not just one situation I misunderstood that can be ""resolved"" in one conversation, when she can't even have a healthy conversation via text) ""Therefore I was wondering if you would be willing to meet up on your terms. You say the time & place & if you feel more comfortable you are welcome to bring a friend along for support. I really don't want to argue with you, I just want the chance to sort this out."" 

I think that message speaks for itself. The gaslighting has also began to make me question my memory, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's not just about that, it's our entire relationship, the emotional neglect, invalidation, gaslighting, entitlement, contempt.

A couple days later my older brother phoned me up & confided in me that he's upset that me & my mum aren't ""friends"". We were on the phone for half an hour & it consisted of him asking why we fell out, asking to know at least one reason why, saying he needs to know why so he knows why he's crying every night, suggesting we go for a coffee with my mum to try to sort it out, etc. He doesn't take no for an answer & pushes boundaries, which I find incredibly difficult. I hate that he's now parentified. I hate that my mum told them her narrative (which I told her was inappropriate, & she obviously didn't respond well too). I hate that I'm causing the pain. I can't explain how much that conversation broke my heart.

Since my mum messaged, & I had that conversation with my brother, I'm wondering if I should just try to go back to being friendly & pretending everything is fine, as the pain, pushback & pressure I'm causing is unbearable.

I feel powerless and destabilized by her pattern of denial and gaslighting. Every time I seem to stabilize, & my therapy sessions aren't taken over by processing ongoing trauma, something with her knocks me back into the cycle. I’ve lost most of my support system and now only have one close friend and my therapist. 

I feel like I'm at one of the lowest points in my life, it feels like everything is falling apart & it's all my fault, even though I know my needs matter too.

I love her for what she's needed to sacrifice to love me, and I love her for the very fact that she's a really good person when you look at the cards she's been dealt.

We live in the stereotypical Asian household of a country whose international fame does not extend to its prosperity. In other terms, this place sucks economically. My mother lived in a crowded house— many siblings, two of which died early on. Her mother slaved away as a maid under politicians, her father a fisherman. Neither of which were home often, in hopes of at least food being able to show up the next day. She was the second to the youngest of all of them, and wasn't treated especially kindly by her siblings.

She was really popular in school, my Mother. She told my sibling and I about stuff like how her valentines cards would pile at her desk, and how showy all of her suitors were. She held the hearts of many people, and she still thinks back fondly to it (I hope she doesn't regret my father as much as I do). 

The problem lies with where she wanted to end up. Choosing blindly, she went for something within the computer field. She was a working student— handling customer service and money , of which she didn't find herself happy in at all. She said, somehow, the IT course she took was the right course, and that she was really excited to work in that field.


She didn't end up working there. My mother currently works as something I won't disclose because it'd be far too revealing [and ruin the point of my anonymity]. It's a job surrounded by assholes who smoke all the time and treat her nd her coworkers like shit. This is where she had met my father, a coworker of another branch at the time. 

We'll skip over their whole story, and travel up 'till around 2021. Around this time, I was 13-14 years of age, and really liked the whole art design thing that went around. Those rigs and stuff for VTUBERS and streamers were huge, and I thought I could make good money by getting into it. Which I did, for a little while. But at one point, somehow, I got skewed and found myself in discord servers of people who did stuff like ""kitten"" work for nitro and stuff. 

It's embarassing. I got intrigued. It was simple enough, in my eyes. But it just kept getting worse from there. And it never did just stop at one video call or a few photos. more servers, different work, more serious requests. It became a job, of sorts to me. And i COULD care less. i COULD disregard the dirty feeling i get when i think about it too long. that would be easy. i just need to forget where the money came from and spend it before it felt too gross to be in my account. 

But. [and the ""but"" you were waiting for] my mother was infatuated. she loved he idea of being able to work at home. she adored the fact that i was so tech savvy that i got so much money in a considerably short amount of time. she had sparkles in her eyes every time i got her something, and she only played it off as a joke when she asked me to teach her how i got my customers but I knew she wanted to live the lie i put up. and sometimes, when i'm particularly stupid, i agree. i get her hopes up. and then i remember where that stupid fucking money comes from, and i can't look her in the eyes.

i only dig myself further deeper. the other night, over dinner, my father somehow leads us to a conversation about work. about ""my field"" of work. and how it's ""really limited"", and how it's understandable that i ""ignore my mother every time she asks to help"". i wanted to cry. because i LOVE my mother. i love her so much. it's starting to frustrate me how neither parents see how much I love her. 

my Mom is so kind and gets in the way between my dad and I when his anger gets particularly physical. my mom who held back tears that one time during church because i had faught with my father just before it. my mom who keeps forcing herself to get smaller no matter how much i tell her that aging is beautiful. my mom whose husband doesn't really pay attention when she talks, and never notices me trying my hardest to listen. my mom who always does stuff around the house because she's had to learn that having things to clean was a privillege. my mom who supports her mother almost entirely on her own, not caring that none of her siblings bat an eye. my mom, who i would give the world to, but never really my skin. no matter how much she wants to be ""pale"", it's far too dirty for her. i can't actually give her anything meaningful— the one thing she wants from me, really, is a lie.

she can say she wants me to be successful and happy. she could want me to find a circle of people to actually call my friends. she could want me to one day live in a seperate home with a spouse she approves of. but i know she also wants more than what she has right now, and i can't help mourn the fact that she might have been able to, if she hadn't had me. at the very least, she wouldn't have a reminder of what she could have had around her house.

and i'm just generally a bad kid outaide of just that. i forget to say when i come home, i procrastinate on chores, i make my mother cry. and i know this all sounds little, but my mom has so much stuff to do. she keeps stressing that we have to work together and i know that our home feels like a battlefield when my father gets angry, so i know sometimes she feels lonely. she doesn't want to go home and wash the dishes. she doesn't want to schedule the laundry, the ironing of clothes, the sweeping, the diet, the cleaning— all after a long day at work with the worst customers ever. and i don't want her to go through that, either, but it's hard for me to get out of bed. and i know that when whatever this is (depression, anxiety, laziness; call it what you want) starts to show, she blames herself. 

i'd gone to a doctor once and that's the worst i've seen her. on the way home she looked horrified, and when I asked, she only rhetotically asked me why God made it so that ""it"" (my diagnosis) had to happen to her. i quit as soon as i could after, but the effects are still there. man, i just want my mom to be happy. she doesn't deserve half the shit she puts up with. i know dying now will do her so much more harm than good, but if i were given the chance to never have been born at all, I would take it. 

i dont know what to do. i don't know if there's anything TO do. i'm tired. i'm so, so tired of this. i'll go make her a coffee.

1iseu6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1iseu6i/mum_weaponizing_my_brothers_pain_feeling_guilt/,"mum weaponizing my brother’s pain, feeling guilt, pressure & lost in the cycle","**Trigger warning for emotional abuse, gaslighting, suicidal ideation (family member), parentification !!!**

-

**TLDR:** My mum’s emotional abuse and gaslighting have escalated since I set boundaries, including requesting family therapy. She’s weaponizing my brother’s pain, and he’s now begging me to reconcile with her. I’m heartbroken, overwhelmed with guilt, and questioning if I should just pretend everything is fine to ease his suffering. I feel isolated, powerless, and at one of the lowest points in my life. Advice or validation would mean the world.

-

Hi, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trapped, and I could really use some perspective. 

My relationship with my mum has been difficult, to put it lightly. At the beginning of the year it got to the point where I told her family therapy was the only way I would be open to trying to ""resolve things"". She refused at first, but when I stuck to my boundary on that being the only way I will engage with her, she agreed she would ""if that's what it takes"" & to let her know when & where, but stated she wasn’t happy about it. When I said I needed time to think about it, she replied ""this is what you wanted, and now you need time, I give up!”

I was hesitant as since I initially proposed therapy, her emotional abuse has escalated, & I don't believe she genuinely wants to change, she just wants to regain control. 

Last year, I went low-contact with her, only arranging visits with my brothers and taking them for days out instead of going round. This wasn't sustainable & eventually I resumed visiting them at home, initially not interacting with my mum. I found out my older brother (11) was suicidal, so I fought to get him help because my mum is neglectful, avoidant & was minimizing the situation. This was retraumatizing but I'm glad I was there & advocated for him. That’s when I resumed contact, which she mistook for reconciliation. I guess I went back to pretending everything was ok, albeit more boundaried.

Conflict was reignited at the beginning of the year as she pretended she didn't see my relationship status of my first same sex relationship. She admitted it, making it about how much it hurt finding out publicly. I said I might've told her if she responded better when I came out to her, as she basically asked why I was telling her and said I don't need to go round telling everyone. She denies ever saying that, that I misunderstood, she meant something else, etc. One message she sent was ""I don't give a shit what you are"".

When I next saw my brothers, my eldest brother was telling me that my mum doesn't care that I was with my ex & questioned me in such a way that parrotted my mum & triggered an emotional flashback.

Last week, my grandad told me to meet him for a coffee, which I was correct in thinking would be about my mum. He told me he was only getting involved now as my 11 year old brother has been crying himself to sleep every night over this. Bare in mind I have been parentified & my mum has been using weaponizing my siblings and trying to guilt trip me with them.

The next day my mum messaged me saying ""grandad told me you had a chat. I understand how you feel about the family therapy but obviously neither of us has the spare money to pay for it"" (I told my grandad I expect her to pay half & would get back to her with the fee, as I found a local service with a sliding-scale. I told him I pay for my own therapy but I didn't say I couldn't afford it-not to say that I can, but I would make it work) ""I really want to discuss things with you so we can resolve the situation as I have no idea how you have come to the conclusion that I reacted badly to you coming out. I really do think it's one big misunderstanding we can resolve by talking"" (again, I've explained it's not just one situation I misunderstood that can be ""resolved"" in one conversation, when she can't even have a healthy conversation via text) ""Therefore I was wondering if you would be willing to meet up on your terms. You say the time & place & if you feel more comfortable you are welcome to bring a friend along for support. I really don't want to argue with you, I just want the chance to sort this out."" 

I think that message speaks for itself. The gaslighting has also began to make me question my memory, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's not just about that, it's our entire relationship, the emotional neglect, invalidation, gaslighting, entitlement, contempt.

A couple days later my older brother phoned me up & confided in me that he's upset that me & my mum aren't ""friends"". We were on the phone for half an hour & it consisted of him asking why we fell out, asking to know at least one reason why, saying he needs to know why so he knows why he's crying every night, suggesting we go for a coffee with my mum to try to sort it out, etc. He doesn't take no for an answer & pushes boundaries, which I find incredibly difficult. I hate that he's now parentified. I hate that my mum told them her narrative (which I told her was inappropriate, & she obviously didn't respond well too). I hate that I'm causing the pain. I can't explain how much that conversation broke my heart.

Since my mum messaged, & I had that conversation with my brother, I'm wondering if I should just try to go back to being friendly & pretending everything is fine, as the pain, pushback & pressure I'm causing is unbearable.

I feel powerless and destabilized by her pattern of denial and gaslighting. Every time I seem to stabilize, & my therapy sessions aren't taken over by processing ongoing trauma, something with her knocks me back into the cycle. I’ve lost most of my support system and now only have one close friend and my therapist. 

I feel like I'm at one of the lowest points in my life, it feels like everything is falling apart & it's all my fault, even though I know my needs matter too.

1isetng,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1isetng,"Help with positioning, settings, and upgrade questions","So current setup is Arc + Sub 3 + pair of One SLs in the rear. My living area is a little difficult to get proper placement. 

First photo is the left side of my back wall. I have the One SL at approximate ear height when seated on the couch. It can't really go over anymore because of the door. You can also see there is a wide open stairwell leading to the second floor in the same area so its not a normal room corner. The speaker is angled slightly inwards. 

Photos 2 and 3 show the right side speaker on the same back wall. It is also angled inwards and its about as close as I can get it due to the window being in the way. The distance between the two One SLs are approx 10.5 feet from center to center. You can also see in photo 3 that the other end of the room is wide open leading into the dining area.

Photos 4 and 5 show the Arc and Sub placement. The Arc is approx 1 inch in front of the TV and 4 inches from the edge of the TV stand. It is slighly raised sitting on the legs of a third party TV stand but only by about half an inch. Measuring vertically, the center of the Arc is about 2.25 feet from the floor and 5.5 feet from the ceiling (ceiling height is around 7 foot 10 inches). The Arc is also approx 8 feet away from us when sitting on the couch. 

Worth noting the Arc and TV are NOT centered between the two One SLs. It is offset by maybe 1.5 to 2 feet. I can't really slide the TV stand further down the wall in order to center it because there is an air vent in the way (photo 6).

I could always ditch the TV stand and wall mount my television and the Arc which would allow me to slide them down and center them better between the One SL positions but I really dont want to go that route. 

Photo 7 is a rough sketch showing the positioning from above as best as I could in Microsoft paint lol. 

All of that said...given the room shape and current position restrictions, I am wondering if it would be a waste of money to upgrade anything. I was thinking of replacing the One SLs with Era 300s and maybe the Arc with the Arc Ultra. I would not replace the Sub.

I do feel the current sound is good but I often don't find myself truly feeling ""surround sound"" or experiencing Atmos the way you would expect. I probably do 50/50 streaming and physical media as I have a medium sized physical collection of 4ks and Blu-ray movies which are played on a Panasonic UB820.

Would I likely see any benefits from upgrading or is the room just not suited for surround sound? I am also wondering if I should tweak my settings. I don't have any ios devices capable of tuning the system so all settings are at factory default. I'm honestly not even sure what some of the surround and height settings even do so I havent messed with them.

Looking for any feedback, input on upgrade value, and settings recommendations. Thanks so much!",2,1739891408.0,sonos,0,1.0,False
1iseteh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1iseteh/a_positive_post_to_spread_some_hope_plus_tips/,A Positive post to spread some hope - plus tips!,"Buckle up for a long one; recently completed and moved into mine and my partners forever home. I used this sub a lot when we were looking for a house and moving and wanted to spread some cheer and some tips we picked up a long the way.

We listed our house in April 2024 and completed Jan 2025 and while yes we had a few hick ups a long the way the whole thing was fairly stress free in the grand scheme of things looking back. We live on the Scottish border but are in England and were only in a two property chain just as an FYI.

**1 - Be picky with your Estate agent.**

We got 3 valuations and they all came back the same but we went with the one that was most honest and genuinely seemed like they wanted us to sell the house for the best price in a short time frame. Lots of other houses on our estate of a similar standard and size had been on the market a few months and so we priced ours 2k less than the valuation (and other similar houses) and sold it within a week. If it hadn't been for our EA telling us to do that I don't think we would have sold as fast as we did. 

Having said that our estate agent was useless in every other sense of the word. We did all the viewings of our property ourselves and when we wanted to pull out of the purchase of an initial property they didn't tell our buyer for 2 weeks. I firmly believe they are all as bad as one another at this point because I am yet to hear of someone having a great experience with an EA all round.

**2 - What's the worst that happens, you don't move?**

Originally we had an offer accepted on house that was owned by one of my partners childhood friends parents. However, the level 2 survey we got done showed some potential structural issues and despite paying for drainage surveys and a structural engineers report as well, no one could tell us quite what the cause of the issue was or how much it may cost to fix. In fact when we spoke to the structural engineer his words were ""it will either cost you a load of money, or a shit load of money"". We loved the house but realized we had been looking at it through rose tinted glasses due to our relationship with the seller. We didn't have a bottomless pit of money to throw at the problem and the house needed a good face lift as well in general. As much as we didn't want to potentially loose our buyer we knew the best choice was to pull out.

What was the worst thing that could have happened, our buyer pulled out and we ended up back at the start, yes we had spent money on surveys ect (£1500ish). but it would have cost us a lot more had we plowed on. Don't be afraid to back out. This is probably the biggest purchase of your life, we still had a house to live in, it was going to be okay, even if it is a little disappointing.

We actually found a new property within 2 weeks that wasn't on the market when we were first looking. It was the perfect house and it is now were we are. Sometimes the bump in the road will catapult you into something better. Those 2 weeks I barely slept with nerves about what was going to happen but it was worth it in the end.

**3 - If it makes sense for you: use a mortgage advisor/broker.**

Ours cost us £150 in an ""admin fee"" but they were worth their weight in gold! They advised on the best deal which for us ended up with us porting our current mortgage and then they did all the paperwork and we literally signed on the dotted line. I know some are free ect so can't compare but ours were great, always replied to emails, chased our EA and Solicitors to get everything sorted. It was a breath of fresh air.

**4 - Don't be afraid to harass your solicitors (within reason)**

Our solicitors were actually alright in the large part. I do think this was mostly down to the fact that I work over the road from their office and so most paperwork ect. I was able to print at work, sign that night with my partner and drop off the next day. Seeing them face to face meant they knew they couldn't fob me off and when we hit the bump in the road of pulling out of one house and finding the one we are currently in I was able to get everything moving pronto.

For the unholy amount of money we all pay these people you think they would be better at organizing things themselves; and whilst they themselves were lovely I could see how crazy busy they were so don't be afraid to ask or give them a nudge.

**5 - USE A REMOVAL COMPANY!**

Don't kid yourself into hiring a couple vans and going for it yourselves. It will cost you more in broken/damaged furniture and wanting to kill each other than its worth. To move from a 3 bed semi to a 4 bed detached 5 minutes drive apart cost us £1000 including all the packing materials (boxes, bubble wrap, and paper) and both my partner and I agree that it was the best money we spent on the whole move. The packing materials got delivered before Christmas. We started packing the house up a week before we moved and on moving day 3 lads in a lorry turned up at 9:30am and in 90 minutes the house was empty.

We were dumbstruck, just stood there staring as they hossed the washing machine out the back door like it weighed nothing. They took furniture apart and when we got to the new place everything was put back together in the room we wanted it in. We felt a bit useless if I'm being honest but it made the whole day stress free. I just kept them fed with coffee, squash and biscuits. We finished the day tired, but so so happy, and most importantly; not wanting to kill each other.

  
Yes moving house is stressful, but doom scrolling on reddit can make it so easy to think only the worst can happen and everyone is out to get you. I hope this helps some people feel better and if you had a shit experience I am sorry, I can't imagine how it feels when your spending all this money and it goes tits up.

- Getting the burglar ring and the slime charmer ring before GI (Burglar ring helps tremendously with the 16 dragon teeth you need)
- Using kegs as a main money source

- Selling iridium bars for profit - I had about 10 heavy furnaces so after each skull cavern run I could offload all the iridium. 

Here‘s what almost killed the run:
- Not checking the cart every time: I never got a red cabbage. I went to the skull cavern for several days straight with monster musk on to get it.
- Not starting money early - especially neglecting the house upgrade. Could have taken advantage of the casks, this way I only had one round of casks finished on the last day of the round
- Gus didn‘t go to GI. I had to get a perfection waiver for the last recipe (i knew this was a possibility so I planned on having an extra 500k at the end)
- I forgot to buy wood from Robin. So annoying. Ended up planting trees, fertilizing them and getting wood that way.
- Didn‘t have enough fiber for the statue of blessings because of all the tea saplings I crafted earlier. I didn‘t get the fiber seed quest until very late so I had to wait for the statue for a really long time!",0,1739891191.0,StardewValley,0,0.5,False

1isenxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1isenxu/ooze_of_the_heart_pt_1/,Ooze of the Heart (pt 1),"""Cupid? And that's your real name?"" Hedge Rayland asked his newest patient, Devlin Cupid, a newly married man age 24, Tall, Average build, curly red hair, and seeking help with self-control. At least that's what it said on his patient application form he filled out a week prior.

Chuckling Devlin responded ""Yeah, it's real. I get that a lot. People just think I'm messing with em' given the hair and all."" He looked down at the oak coffee table at a half-drank cup of coffee that separated the two men as he finished his sentence.

Dr. Rayland's office had a warm venerable aspect to it, from the Victorian-style furniture to the posh lighting fixtures adorning the burgundy and emerald walls. Seeming out of time for the modern 1980s world they lived in. Rayland looked a man far out of his own age, only 33 he carried himself very properly with combed-back brown hair and a tidy mustache, a vest with a black blazer and an antique pipe he would puff on occasionally throughout his appointments. However the addition of Rayland's light Bostonian accent made for a contrasting persona, the voice not matching the face and all that. Devlin didn't quite know what to make of the man. 

""A fine name son, no worries of it, now what I like to do for first appointments is break the ice a little. I tell you something about me, you tell me something about you, so on and so forth. For instance, crosswords, I adore a good crossword in the morning, really gets the brain moving, y'know what I mean?"" Hedge said, giving Devlin a calming gaze, sitting in anticipation. 

Nothing, Devlin just sat there giving a blank-faced open mouth stare at the Dr.

With a wide-eyed grimace, Rayland leaned forward and gave a gesture of ""Okay now you go"" 

The red haired man's gears finally started cranking as he fumbled with his words ""Oh ugh yeah, I ugh, football, I like watching football"" 

""Ah, football very nice! A big sports fan!"" Rayland exclaimed, internally thinking ""Wow this guy is the real deal, a true bonafide dullard""

""Okay so you're a sports guy, I'm a words guy. How about you tell me what you do for work?"" Rayland inquired not wanting to drag this appointment out longer than he needed.

""I work down at Hemms, you know the chemical disposal plant near the Commonwealth flats, I ugh. Well you know I take out the old barrels and ugh. I put em in the trucks and the guys, they ugh they take em away."" Devlin stuttered out

""Oh disposal work, keeping the earth clean, very noble work my friend"" Rayland kept a very professional front but could not get this over with faster, he had spent the night prior with a slim, dark hair 25 year old he met down at Muse. Up until 3am, barely a drop of sleep and a hangover that could put a bear into early hibernation.

Wanting to get on with the appointment Rayland asks ""So I see you're having issues with impulse control? What exactly are these impulses of yours?""

Nervously Devlin responds ""Well you see doc, I ugh. Now haha now this is gonna sound just so out there, but it's about my ugh. My wife ya see."" Devlin pauses

""Your wife? Is there some kind of overzealousness you have with your wife in a sexual manner? You know that's pretty normal for newlyweds Mr. Cupid."" Rayland rebutted 

""Oh no no haha no it's nothing like that at all doc, I ugh ha we don't exactly do that"" visible uncomfortable Devlin adjusts himself in his chair.

""Hmm okay well what is it then?"" Rayland becoming more impatient with every interaction with Devlin and he fears his frustration is starting to show.

""Well you see, I want to kill my wife."" Devlin stated in a cool and collected time ""I want to cut her open and pull her heart right out of her chest."" The man's tone changed on a dime.

A chill runs up Rayland's spine as he stares at the coffee cup in front of him, wide-eyed, not quite sure if he should make eye contact, he just lets Devlin continue.

""I just love her so much doctor, I can't stand to see anyone even look at her, I want to take her away from this gawking world. Take her heart and put it in my pocket."" Devlin says, grasping at something invisible with his hand.

Finally looking up to the man Rayland finds his cold gray eyes staring directly at him. Another chill runs up his spine and into his head, rattling his brain with a shiver. A primeval desire to get the hell out of this room right now almost overtakes him. 

""N-now, why would you want to go and do that, Devlin?"" Stammered Rayland.

""Mr. Cupid if you don't mind, doctor."" Devlin stated plainly

""Oh, ugh, of course, sorry Mr. Cupid."" it seemed Rayland had the roles reversed on him and he felt like the scared bumbling idiot now. 

""Didn't you hear me before doctor? I love her."" A smirk crept up on Devlin's face as he spoke.

""That's what I'm not understanding here. Mr. Cupid, if you loved her, well why on earth would you want to take her life?"" Questioned Rayland.

""Wouldn't you do anything for the ones you love, doctor? She made vows to me, not to this vile world, not to these sick people. To me. I need to take her away from it all before it's too late.""
Again another overwhelming urge to flee washed over Rayland, fighting it back with all his will he sat planted and tried to keep his composure.

""But, why tell me any of this?"" Not knowing if he wanted the answer to that question or not

""Well, cause you killed your wife too, Dr. Wayland. Isn't that right?"" Asked Devlin ""You smothered her to death in her sleep, you're just like me"" giving a devilish grin.

""DONG"" The antique clock rang off signaling an end to the appointment.

""Well, that's our time!"" Rayland shot up and quickly hurried to rush Devlin out of the door.

""Oh, uh, oh already doc?"" Devlin's previous demeanor returned as the act of Rayland grabbing and rushing the man out.

""I am afraid so lad, all the time we have today"" hastened Rayland. 

""Oh uh, okay doc I uh I guess same time next week huh?"" Asked Devlin.

""Yes yes lad, same time, best be off now."" Rayland rushed 

""Okay bye d...."" Rayland slammed the door on Devlin before he could finish his sentence.

Turning quick the doctor rushed over to his cupboard and poured a stiff glass of gin, dowing the floral liquor Rayland took a deep gasping breath ""Fucking madman, crazy fucking psychotic madman!"" 

""You smothered your wife in her sleep."" The words rang in his mind. 
""Did I hear him right? Rayland? No Wayland!"" Rayland shouted. ""He got me confused for Duluth Wayland!"" Another practicing therapist Wayland had been in the news recently but only by name. Remembering the still active case from earlier in the year, the police suspected murder and Wayland was high up in the list of possible suspects.  

""I just got roped into some maniac's murderous delusion over mistaken identity!!!"" Rayland bent over with the anticipation of vomiting. 

""BZZZZZ!!"" The buzzer to Rayland's office went off and the door swung open, Chelsea Valenta, Rayland's 24 year old receptionist. Chelsea had been working for Rayland for the better part of three years now screening clients and collecting payments. She came marching in over to Rayland with a deeply concerned look on her pale face, her blue eyes peeking through her soft blonde hair with worry. 

""Okay that guy, what the hell is up with him? He just walked past and gave me the craziest stare down I've ever seen."" She said in a whispered yell.

""I need you to get the police on the line now, that guy can't be allowed to go home to his wife."" Rayland said, adjusting his coat in an attempt to compose himself. 

________________________________________________

""His wife?"" The Boston police officer asked 

""Yes, he said he wanted to cut her open!  I really don't think we should take a chance with this guy."" Rayland said as he poured himself another glass of gin

""And he just up and told you all this, for no reason?"" Questioned the officer 

""No, I think he thought I was Duluth Wayland, similar names, same job. I think he just got me confused with that guy and he thought I would relate to him?"" Rayland knew how it sounded and could tell he wasn't exactly getting through to the cop in front of him.

""Look, can you just go and check up on him? Make sure nothing is going on?"" Rayland pleaded 

""As soon as you called in we went to the guy's apartment but no one was home, we'll try his work tomorrow to see if we can catch him there and take him in for evaluation. You said the Hemms plant right?"" The officer gave a reassuring gesture to the disheveled man.

""Yes that's correct, just please find this guy. In all my years I've never seen a man so resolute in his own bullshit."" Rayland said, speaking through lighting his pipe.

""We'll be on it, Doc. I promise. Look you've had a rough day, just go home and try to get some rest, we'll keep you updated okay?"" The cop put his coat back on and slipped out of the office. 

""Yes, very good, thank you officer. I'll be hearing from you"" Rayland waved the cop off and closed up his office for the night. Laying in bed after nearly a whole bottle of 80 proof gin, Rayland tossed and turned trying to get some shut eye but knew none would come to him this night, or any night soon. His hands trembled by the day's happenings and opted to do some late night reading. He decided to finally finish off Lightning by Dean Koontz, he'd been a sucker for a good horror novel since he was a boy growing up in midtown. They had an oddly soothing effect on him, often sending him off to his own dream world before he could finish a chapter. Tonight was no different, a mere 10 words away from the chapter's end Hedge Rayland was in a restless slumber.

I keep falling asleep sometimes I get a warning where I get extremely exhausted before falling asleep or times I will just fall asleep and this will happen in unprompted. Once I fall asleep there's nothing anyone can do to wake me up I've slept for alarms I slept through loud noises and being shaken and I have not woken up at all. I will sleep from anywhere from two hours to 48 hours there is no rhyme or reason as to how many hours I will be asleep. It's getting to the point where I spend most of my time asleep rather than awake which has severely affected my job to the stage where I might end up losing it because I can't stay awake. 

I have gone to the doctor multiple times but they keep passing me off to other people and they're not giving me any sort of advice or help or doing anything to try and figure out why I keep falling asleep by a drop of the hat. The last time I spoke to a doctor did you said it's because I'm depressed but I have been so since I was 10 and this has never happened there anything that happens with my depression is that I gain insomnia which is a complete opposite to what's going on now. 

I've tried many methods to stay awake I've had a lot of coffee energy drinks there was one stage where I've had 16 cups of coffee and five energy drinks and still I just fell asleep like nothing happened. It's currently at the stage where basically I'm awake for maybe 6-8hr of a day and I can't do anything about that and it's not in one chunk it will be split throughout the day the longest I have been awake currently is 4hr between episodes.

I will list below the current conditions I have been diagnosed with I also have another condition which is in the process of being diagnosed which don't have a name for at the moment. Below that I will also list the current medications I'm on in case this helps.

Fibromyalgia since 2013
Inflammatory arthritis since 2013
sciatica since 2022
severe depression and anxiety since 2007
Hyper mobility since birth
Undiagnosed nerve issue on the left side of my body since 2021
Constantly deficient in vitamin d folic acid and anemic since birth
Reoccurring bursitis on my right shoulder since 2015
Chronic pain since 2015

Medications 
Gabapentalin 600mg 3 times a day 
Etodolac 600mg once a day
Codeine 60mg  4 times a day
Vitamin d supplements once a week 
Folic acid supplements once a week 
Multivitamin everyday 

Please can anyone help I have been trying to get a doctor's to help and I'm at my wits end. I keep getting passed about and nothing is happening I'm worried that soon I won't actually ever be able to wake up. If you need any further information let me know and I'm happy to provide it.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1isekqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllCryptoBets/comments/1isekqb/three_solid_bets_for_an_ethereum_bull_market/,"Three Solid Bets for an Ethereum Bull Market: SPX6900, APU, and KENDU","The Ethereum bull market is no longer on the horizon. It is unfolding now, with liquidity flooding the system and amplifying narratives in real time. SPX6900, Apu Apustaja, and Kendu Inu are emerging as key players, each driven by its own momentum and community strength.

SPX6900 is raw acceleration. A meme that has broken free from its origins, it moves through social media, trading groups, and algorithmic market flows with relentless force. The price chart reflects this movement, driven by sheer engagement and speculative intensity. Murad’s thesis suggests that in an era of hyper-financialization, only the most resonant symbols persist. SPX6900 embodies this reality, not just following the cycle but shaping it. 

Apu Apustaja carries the weight of inevitability. A relic from the internet’s earlier days, it has re-emerged as a financial asset with deep cultural roots. The combination of nostalgia and adaptability makes it a powerful force in the current market. Murad has pointed out that memes with lasting network effects can evolve into economic primitives, embedding themselves in the financial system. Apu is already moving in this direction, integrating into DeFi and expanding across multiple chains. Price action is secondary to its growing network effect. 

Kendu Inu operates differently. It is not just a viral token or an old meme resurfacing but a fully self-organizing movement. The Community Takeover was more than a shift in governance. It was a moment of awakening, where the network itself took control of its destiny. Kendu is pushing beyond the typical crypto cycle, expanding into real-world projects like art takeovers, energy patches, and coffee, while raising funds to establish a bridge to Base chain. Its holders are not just traders but builders, actively shaping the token’s trajectory. Murad’s thesis on network-driven financialization suggests that in a liquidity-driven future, the strongest, most engaged communities will absorb the most value. Kendu fits this model perfectly. It does not rely on external adoption. It creates its own. 

The Ethereum market is accelerating. Capital is moving, narratives are forming, and certain tokens are rising to the forefront. SPX6900, Apu Apustaja, and Kendu Inu are not just surviving this shift. They are defining it.

I will take the MLTE this March 2025! I would just like to share about this review center because they are really a topnotch and chef's kiss in terms of lectures and care for their enrollees!!!

Refresher Courses: These are notes given by Excellero before the start of the actual class. Like upon downpayment magbibigay sila ng notes and recorded lecture videos na you can watch on your own pace. May schedule na ibibigay para may guide ka at meron ring mga assessment exams at ratio every after subject. From the name itself, refresher course, para iboost ulit yuhg napagaralan during the Bachelor years. Kumbaga start up guide before the official lectures. Although hindi ko naopen to kasi I thought kaya pa icram by the end of the ftf class HAHAHAHA!

Mother Notes and Lecturers: Grabe complete na lahat and most of the lecturers are of the National One's. Sobrang siksik ng notes and madaling intindihin plus ang gagaling pa ng mga lecturer. Ipapaintindi talaga nila sayo yung topics and if kinakailangan, nagaadjust sila sa discussion according to the pace of students. Hindi fast paced and very convenient to sa mga students like me na medyo mabagal ang learning style at hindi ganun kaganda ang foundation sa mga subjects. Really, grabe walang masabi!

Final Coaching Notes: OMG!!! THE BEST! Ang galing ni Sir Jericho magturo ng CC, MicroPara, at CM!! Top notch lecturer ever and grabe ang care niya about the student's understanding sa topics! To think ang taas ng rating niya sa CC during their board exam days like 97%??? For real mas magiging maganda pa ang foundation mo sa mga subjects lalo na ang galing galing niya magturo! Pagsamahin mo mother notes from Excellero tapos Final Coaching Notes, boogsh, ang ganda na ng foundation mo! Hindi nakakaoverwhelm ang pagtuturo niya and other lecturers sa final coaching. Final coaching notes is hindi lang siya Q and A kasi as in idiscuss lahat ng need idiscuss. Complete and very informative

Grand Final Coaching: Mga notes dito ay tabulated form na and ito na yung pinasiksik na mga recalls and topics na high yield sa board exam! This will serve as additional info sa Final Coaching Notes! Grabe rin pagtuturo dito at ipapaintindi talaga! Top tier at magagamit mo talaga pag nagcracram ka na kasi one glance andun na lahat ng info!

Enhancement Notes: These are additional notes na like reinforcement of the Mother Notes pero with a twist! Hindi siya in sentence form but in a tabulated form. Then question answer and type niya with explanation. This is thru online mode which is good kasi after a long tiring ftf classes, finally sa bahay/apartment ka lang tapos watch ka lang ng recorded video.

Assessment Exams and Ratio: Kering keri ang assessment exams! Madali siya kung nagbasa ka ahhahaha and di mo grasp ang topic, meron namang Ratio. Ang ratio nila ay umaabot ng 4 hrs per subject which is good for me kasi naeexplain talaga ng maayos ang topics na hindi ka pa well-versed! Ang nagraratio usually ay Doctors and Latin Honor students!

Pre boards: Surprise na lang to pero one thing, MAHIRAP ANG PRE BOARDS NILA HUHUHU. Pero iraratio yan ng maayos! 

Schedule: One thing I like about Excellero ay hindi siksik ang sched. Balance ang pasok sa review center at may breaks in between. Like after 4 days lecture sa isang subject, may 4 days na rest/self study days and after that, assessment exam na. As for me na mas nakakareview if I self- study and read notes on my own, I really like the pacing of the schedule. Mababalance mo ang life and study mo in which is good for the mental health. Hindi pinilit ang schedule para lang matapos within a time frame. Well-planned ang sched!!! Maayos!

Venue: TOP TIER VENUE!!! ANG CONDUCIVE NG ENVIRONMENT VERY MODERN AND ANG LAMIG LAMIG! Di rin projector ang gamit kundi TV!!! 4 TVs!!! May free water pa kasi may water dispenser na provided by the RC, free coffee etc etc. Grabe ang generous nila magbigay ng necessities rin. May pakain pa!!! Like from the staffs of Excellero.

Staff: One thing about them, sila ay caring, thoughtful, considerate, at kind. Never saw other RC staff na ganun. Malapit sila sa students at higit sa lahat grabe sila maghandle. May palaro at papremyong pera minsan pag nakikita na nilang stressed and students! Hahaha! May pa Xmas party pa at sandamakmak ng papremyo! And nagbibigay sila ng Board Exam kits na pwedeng magamit during the board exam! The best! They treat us like family hindi lang reviewees! THE BEST!

Over all Rating: 1Million/10. I highly recommended Excellero as your Review Center for MTLE!! Grabe! Alagang alaga ka intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually! ",3,1739890270.0,MedTechPH,0,1.0,False

This is a long post so please bare with me. I’m 32F. Been physically and emotionally abused by my mum through most of my childhood. My dad is the kindest person but is also my mum’s punch bag. He lost his career bc of her and mentally he has shut down. It’s sad to see once happy, hard working man turn into a depressed aging man. I’m surprised they are together still and didn’t get divorced. 
I’ve managed to create my own career. I don’t make a lot of money but I make enough to save a little and get by. I’ve been financially supporting myself since 23. 

My parents got into a bad car accident last year. My dad was injured a lot so he couldn’t work for one year. My mum suffered minor injuries but a couple months ago she had a stroke but luckily no big damage but she still can’t work either. Luckily my grandparents are rich so they are supporting my parents monthly. Even when my mum was well enough to work, she couldn't hold a job down for more than a month. 

She is mentally troubled. Tried everything from psychologists, medications. thought of putting her into a psych ward level crazy, you name it. Nothing worked. Now she's older, it's gotten less severe. But that personality still remains. 

Even after all the shit my mum put us through growing up, I still love her and care about her..And I forgive her because I know better. Recently she's asked to borrow money from me to pay of her credit card debt bc she's buying a ton of health supplements ""for her health"" which cost a lot of money. So I did that. But now for a while she's been asking to pay for our familiy's dog and cat's food/supplies, at least once a month. 

Yesterday, I introduced my LDR boyfriend of 8 months who i'm serious about to my parents before he went back to his country. We had coffee and things were going ok but the entire time they just kept joking around and not taking my bf seriously. My mum told my bf that ""she hopes he becomes a rich man"" (to provide for me). My bf is not financially well off and it's not a big worry. As long as we can work hard together, it's no problem for me. But I felt so ashamed that my mum said that to my bf when it's their first time meeting. My family keeps pressuring me to get married and wants me to marry a rich guy that can take care of me. But I know a part of them wants my future husband to financially provide for them as well bc they suck at handling money and spend it all, always asking my grandparents for money as well as us. 

 And I understand where they're coming from but i'm just starting to get really tired of everything..I'm already stressed with work and all. And now sometimes when i'm super tired or not in a good mental state, I feel like i'm becoming like my mum sometimes which scares the f out of me. I don't wanna become like her at all but i'm scared bc it might be genetic. They said they can't support me financially when I get married. I don't even expect shit from them. It's just they are now sick which is gonna become more of a burden for me and my younger brother in the future. Who else is gonna take care of them? I don't care if they didn't do a good job raising me. The least they can do is live well for themselves but they always have some problem or issue that puts a burden on me and my brother even to this day. 

I just want to live a normal life and not worry about stupid things that are not worth thinking about. So i've been seriously considering to start keeping my distance from them. I'm even thinking of moving to another country to be with my boyfriend in a couple of years time because as much as I care for them, I really just want to live happy. But a part of me does really care for them and worried for them too. I don't know what to do really..Anyone with a similar experience?

I posted a couple days ago as new to this page and I actually have questions this time. I realized I was in a flare when I couldn't sleep and my resting heart rate was 100 bpm. Prior to this I had been doing well with a bland diet, about 11 weeks of minimal to no symptoms. I believe I either had a stomach bug, or I reintroduced coffee too soon (I know it was too soon but my GI did not seem too concerned about my gastritis so I didn't start taking it seriously until literally this week). However, this flare up does not feel as bad as previous flare ups, I definitely have pain in more places, as it spreads out both on the left, right, and middle to the point I panicked a little about gallstones. But I'm not nauseous, I don't feel pain when I eat, and no brain fog. 

For those who have healed, how far back does a flare up set you? Is it possible I was healing for 11 weeks and this flare up isn't as bad? I have a second condition that requires endoscopies so I have to have another in a month, I might need to move to Omaha for an internship over the summer as well and I'm nervous about living on my own if I'm still dealing with this (which I know it's likely I am) I have an appointment with my GI on monday, so I just need help figuring out what to discuss with her.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

This one’s been flying under the radar, but there are a few reasons I’m paying attention:

**Current Price:** ~$0.65

**Massive Opportunity in China:** They’ve locked in a distribution deal with *at least* 550 Lawson convenience stores. If you’ve ever been to China, you know Lawson is like the 7/11 of dreams—people are in and out of those stores all day long. When I was there last November, I unknowingly saw these drinks at some Lawson entrances, right alongside their other  ""pseudodrugs"" (basically herbal supplement/vitamin drinks). While this deal focuses on China, it feels inevitable that Japan would be next—just makes sense given the market overlap, IYKYK.

**Global Expansion:** They’ve opened offices in multiple regions worldwide. These guys aren’t just playing in one region—they’re setting up for global growth.

**Consumable Goods:** Coffee and convenience drinks are their game. And, let’s face it, we all know caffeine and grab-and-go beverages basically print money.

Now, for some quick historical perspective:

**52-Week Low:** $0.2500—so it’s already up quite a bit this year.

**50-Day Moving Average:** $0.7517—it’s trading below that right now, so maybe we’re catching it on a dip?

**Average Volume:** 3M—people are trading this; it’s not just crickets out there.

**My Position** I’ve got $1K riding on this one. Not betting the farm, but it’s enough to check my portfolio every so often.

This feels like one of those situations where a solid PR push, a new distribution deal, or even better-than-expected earnings could send it soaring. But hey, I’m just a guy with a caffeine habit, not a financial advisor.

So, what do y’all think? Is this a hidden gem ready to shine, or am I just drinking the Kool-Aid (or maca, in this case)?

Let me know your thoughts, do your own DD, and poke holes in this if you see something I’m missing. This could get interesting! DYOR, of course. ☕🚀",1,1739889944.0,pennystocks,1,1.0,False

It was one of those big house parties where things got kind of wild, but I was mostly just hanging out, drinking a little, and talking to people. At some point, this girl (I think she was 19) started flirting with me. I was polite but not really interested. She kept getting closer, touching my arm, laughing a little too hard at my jokes, that kind of thing. I tried to give her subtle signals that I wasn’t feeling it, but she wasn’t picking up on them.

Then, out of nowhere, she just grabbed my face and kissed me. I didn’t see it coming at all. It was aggressive, and my first instinct was to push her off. I didn’t shove her with full force or anything, just a quick reaction to get her off me. But I guess she wasn’t expecting it, and she lost her balance she tripped over the edge of the couch and fell straight through a glass coffee table. It shattered, and everyone turned to look.

She wasn’t seriously hurt, but she did get some cuts, and people started freaking out. Some were asking if she was okay, but others started yelling at me, saying I overreacted and that I shouldn’t have pushed her. A few people said I should have just pulled away instead of pushing.

I tried explaining that it was a reflex, that she literally grabbed and kissed me without my consent, but people kept saying I could’ve handled it differently. Someone even called me an asshole for ""hurting a girl just because she liked me.""

Now, I feel kind of bad because I never meant to hurt her. I just didn’t expect it, and I reacted without thinking. But at the same time, if the roles were reversed, I feel like everyone would’ve been on my side.

1ise6ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1ise6ky/had_my_bisalp_yesterday_at_21/,had my bisalp yesterday at 21!,"hi guys! i had my bisalp yesterday and recovery is going pretty great for me! all in all, the process from the beginning was pretty easy. i have never been to the gyno before so i just found someone off of the list and though just getting an appointment for an annual had a long wait (scheduled it on november 8th and january 29th was the earliest date), she immediately said “okay let’s get your insurance pushed through and we’ll schedule that bisalp!” the second i mentioned it. the office reached back on the next day on january 30th with available dates and my mom and i agreed on february 17th at 1pm which was the earliest one. 

my mom was my biggest supporter through this. as i said, we made the appointment on election day. this has something i’ve wanted for years and i brought it to my mom in passing about a month before the election and she said if i was sure, she would make me the appointment on the spot and pay for it all. i sat on it for a bit while looking for a doctor and she did not lie about taking action the moment i asked.

i had a pre op appointment on february 6th where i signed consents and the doctor spoke to me about what to expect but there was nothing out of the ordinary from what i had already read here. my mom had to pay $544.38 at the pre-op appointment which was not including facility or anesthesia fees for the actual procedure. i know if any bills pop up we can fight them through insurance (we have cigna) but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it!

i was told to not eat or drink anything after midnight but the day before my surgery the anesthesiologist called my mom and said i could have clear liquids (water, sports drinks, black coffee) until 9am but i still stopped drinking at midnight. i got undressed and put on the hospital gown and had a nurse set up and IV in my wrist and she taped my ears as well because i couldn’t get my piercings out because i had my nails done (which they were fine with, they said sometimes dark colors are a problem with the finger heart monitor but my nails are nude.) the OR nurse came to talk to me about my health history just to double check everything was correct and then the anesthesiologist came back as well to introduce himself. he gave me a fraction of anesthesia as they wheeled me back to the OR and i felt a little loopy but was still awake. i got to see a bit of the OR, i had to scoot myself from the gurney to the one in the OR, i remember looking at a white board they had on the wall that looked like it was supposed to have a bunch of detailed info but it was just blank, and the very last thing i remember was the anesthesiologist putting an oxygen mask on me and saying he was going to get me a smaller one.

there was some point after surgery where i woke up and threw up all over myself twice but the nurse cleaned me up and got me a new gown before my mom came to see me in recovery. i woke up a little when my mom came in and started crying because my incisions hurt. they just felt like cramps but anesthesia usually makes me cry. my mom gave me a hug and i got some pain meds in my IV and fell back asleep again. i slept for like an hour which is longer than most people i think because the nurse was reallllllyyyy trying to convince me to wake up and get up lol. my mom helped dress me but i opted out of underwear and a bra because i was soooooo nauseous so the nurse also gave me some anti nausea through the IV. they tried to get me to eat some crackers and drink some water so i could have a NORCO pain pill and my mouth was so dry that the crackers were turning to cement in my
mouth without drinking some water to push it down. this was around 4:30pm

i left a couple minutes after the crackers and NORCO and within 10 minutes i had thrown it up all over my dads car. when i got home i just laid in my parents bed so i wouldnt have to walk up the stairs to my room. i tried to eat some chick fil a so i could have some of the 800mg ibuprofen that was prescribed to me but the lack of saliva was making it hard to chew and swallow and the food was weighing too heavy in my stomach so after a couple of fries and nuggets i went back to bed. luckily i was in little to no pain and didnt have an ibuprofen until around 10pm after getting up to pee. i had no problems peeing and the pain was minimal, just slightly noticeable when it wasn’t before. my dad made me some mashed potatoes and mac and cheese, the mashed potatoes were still a little thick to eat comfortably with how dry my mouth was but the mac and cheese was perfect.

around midnight i was able to walk up the stairs and change my clothes and get myself in and out of my boyfriends very short sports car and he parked further away from his apartment so i could walk a little and i successfully got up the stairs to his apartment as well. usually i sleep without pants but i wore some biker shorts to protect my incisions and for my boyfriends sake because he probably didn’t want to feel the glue on my incisions or see the iodine all over my stomach. 
i woke up at 5am and had another ibuprofen and it’s now 8:30am and i still feel fine. i feel a little sore but my boyfriends bed is much less comfortable than my parents bed. i have successfully peed twice and have had NO gas pain. it almost seems too good to be true so i’m waiting for it to show up tonight or tomorrow but i think i might be in the clear! i also haven’t had any spotting, there was one dot on the pad they gave me at the hospital that was on from around 4pm until 10pm and it was bright orange so i think it was just iodine!

also, i saw my surgeon before my surgery and my mom asked how long until i can have intercourse and the surgeon said i didn’t have to wait but i probably wouldn’t feel up for it for the first few days. the nurse who took care of me after the procedure said 2 weeks which honestly sounds about how long it’ll take me to feel comfortable so i’ll stick with 2 weeks.

but that’s my bisalp story :) shoutout to The List and my parents. i highly recommend this procedure if you’re thinking about it. from what it sounds, ive had one of the easier recoveries but even then… it beats getting pregnant or even worse… giving birth. i am SO happy to have this procedure. the lengths i was willing to go through to terminate a pregnancy… i’m so glad i don’t have to think about that ever again.",9,1739889699.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

1ise5oo,https://i.redd.it/wtj7gyo5twje1.jpeg,My Re-read of The Stand over 30 years later,"I hate to admit it but 16 year old me had a lot more affection for this book than I do now. It’s funny how the brain changes. Or maybe it was that I knew the general gist even if many of the details were murky. Book 1 holds up but there has been such detailed, apocalyptic fiction since that I think things such as 28 Days Later and The Last of Us have spoiled me. But respect as an important predecessor and influence to these works. Book 3 was amazing and did all of the King things. I gobbled it up and LOVED that last bit. 

Book 2… which is the longest section… was a trudge and a slog this time around. Too much time in Boulder. This is where I would have loved to see less committee meetings and late night coffee chats and more of what’s happening in Vegas. Harold and Nadine were the most intriguing parts of this book. There wasn’t enough conflict until there was. >!Mother Abigail who we spent so much time learning her backstory and who became so frustratingly vague disappears for hundreds of pages and the whole time I’m wanting THAT story rather than Glen pontificating or learning about everybody’s work details.!<

>!Also Frannie… started out as this complex character, strong, defiant, has a strong sense of herself and then sort of becomes King’s classic “good lovin’ woman” taking  care of Stu.!<


I didn’t LOVE The Stand as a kid. And now I like it in that “well, you HAVE to read it” way. And I think I struggle with the general consensus of it being King’s magnum opus and his best. I don’t think it’s his best. 

I re-read it because I’m doing a long meandering journey to the Dark Tower. And in that context, I’m happy I read it. Flagg is amazing. And so far Flagg has danced on the edges of these stories and I’m ok with that. I get it. Flagg is a circumstance more than a character but what a delicious circumstance! Next stop: Eyes of the Dragon and then on to the Dark Tower. 

What do you think? Is anybody else not a Stand Stan?

1isdyzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/over60/comments/1isdyzf/elaines_dating_advice_1/,Elaine’s Dating Advice - 1,"I was born in Scotland and received advice, whether solicited or not, from my Mom whose first name was Elspeth.  She was married in 1958 to my Dad, Bryce and we lived in Inverness in a nice home and we vacationed at our home in Loch Lomond.

As I grew older into my teenage years, my Mom and I used to have many talks on dating, marriage and children and what to look for in a man.  She was married at 24.  She encouraged me to not get married too early and to seek my professional life first and use the dating as a side gig.  She used to say, “ you are no longer a ‘bairn’ or a child and need to make responsible decisions from this time forward.

As I am 64, and was married in 1983 at the age of 23, to a man who was a ‘master plumber’ and we had a phenomenal life and lots of income.  I was an editor, writer and photographer and held my own with income.  Together, we made over $800k per year.  Unfortunately, my husband passed in 2012 from a work accident and I was now on my own in life.

My Mom’s words were ever so present now in my life as I, now being scared and lonely in life, should I begin dating again, married again, or should I become the ‘spinster’ that my Mom would not approve.  I decided to date and not shoot for getting married again.

I joined many groups on the church, joined a senior center and developed many friends both male and female and enjoyed dinners, movies, hiking, boating and fishing in the state of Maine.  My goals of friends were completed and many turned into, what I call my, ‘2AM friends’, meaning I could call them in an emergency if needed any time of the day or night.

What started to occur, was I began developing these male friends, or they began to get friendlier.  I was amazed that I still ‘had it’ and accepted their mild advances and went out on dates and with what is now called ‘friends with benefits’.

I decided not to entertain marriage again because of the assets that were accumulated.  I inherited both homes in Scotland and the family businesses along with real estate that Winston and I had purchased and decided to put these assets in trusts for my son and his family, who was born in 1985.

My life in the dating world is good.  I go out on a date maybe once or twice a week with my FWBs and also enjoy times with my female friends in clubs, coffee dates and gossiping.  These women have shown me through conversations that they do not date or get involved which I think is not right.  Human contact is crucial for people and me.

I do still have an intimate life with my FWBs and also enjoy times with myself.  Dating is still an important part of my life not so much the intimacy but also going out and enjoying local life.  Don’t be scared to take a leap but stay true to your values and gut feelings about people you meet.",20,1739889103.0,over60,20,0.95,False

9am- 2 eggs with 1 p ww toast. 
12- protein shake

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I've read the benefits in M&M website, and for me, that i'm making only EU flights that are at most 1:30h long in Economic Class, i don't see much benefits with respect to people not having status.

The only benefits I've used are the ones that are explicitly listed the website: Priority Boarding (i was having also before, because travelling with kids), Priority Handling of luggages (even if last time the luggage hasn't been moved because of the short time), SEN lounge access (as today i've been only to the lounges in FRA, I don't have long layovers, but a couple of time i've been able to take a coffee and a juice for kids), and reserving the seat for free.

  
Sometimes the cabin crew greets us before departure, sometimes they offer something for free (coffee/cola, chocolate from business class). I don't understand why sometimes they do and sometimes don't. I thought was because the flight was almost empty, but they did also once when it was full.

So, what are the ""hidden"" benefits of being senator? What can i ask even if is not written on the M&M website?",2,1739888932.0,Lufthansa,10,0.76,False

1isdr5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_searchengineways/comments/1isdr5k/organic_search_traffic_what_it_is_why_it_matters/,"Organic Search Traffic: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How to Boost It","Organic search traffic is the lifeblood of any successful online presence. It refers to the visitors who land on your website through unpaid search engine results, as opposed to paid ads. For businesses, bloggers, and content creators, organic traffic is a critical metric because it represents a sustainable and cost-effective way to attract potential customers or readers. In this article, we’ll dive into what organic search traffic is, why it’s important, and actionable strategies to increase it.

**What Is Organic Search Traffic?**

Organic search traffic is the portion of website visitors that comes from search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo without any paid promotion. When someone types a query into a search engine and clicks on a non-advertised result, that visit is counted as organic traffic.

For example, if someone searches for “best running shoes 2024” and clicks on your blog post that ranks on the first page of Google, that’s organic traffic. It’s earned through effective SEO (Search Engine Optimization) rather than paid advertising.

**Why Is Organic Search Traffic Important?**

1. **Cost-Effective**: Unlike paid ads, organic traffic doesn’t require ongoing investment. Once your content ranks well, it can continue to drive traffic without additional costs.
2. **High Intent**: Users who find your site through organic search are often actively looking for information, products, or services, making them more likely to convert.
3. **Builds Credibility**: Ranking high in search results signals to users that your site is trustworthy and authoritative.
4. **Long-Term Results**: While paid traffic stops as soon as you stop paying, organic traffic can provide sustained results over time.
5. **Scalable**: As your website grows and gains more authority, your organic traffic can scale significantly.

**How Search Engines Drive Organic Traffic**

Search engines use complex algorithms to determine which pages to display for a given query. These algorithms consider hundreds of factors, including:

* **Relevance**: How well the content matches the user’s search intent.
* **Authority**: The credibility and trustworthiness of the website.
* **User Experience**: Factors like page speed, mobile-friendliness, and ease of navigation.
* **Content Quality**: The depth, accuracy, and usefulness of the content.

By optimizing your website for these factors, you can improve your chances of ranking higher in search results and driving more organic traffic.

**How to Increase Organic Search Traffic: 10 Proven Strategies**

**1. Conduct Keyword Research**

Keyword research is the foundation of any successful SEO strategy. It involves identifying the terms and phrases your target audience is searching for. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to find relevant keywords with high search volume and low competition.

* **Actionable Tip**: Focus on long-tail keywords (e.g., “best running shoes for flat feet”) as they are less competitive and often have higher conversion rates.

**2. Create High-Quality, Engaging Content**

Content is king when it comes to organic traffic. Your content should be informative, engaging, and tailored to your audience’s needs. Aim to answer their questions, solve their problems, or provide valuable insights.

* **Actionable Tip**: Use a mix of content formats, such as blog posts, videos, infographics, and guides, to cater to different preferences.

**3. Optimize for On-Page SEO**

On-page SEO involves optimizing individual pages to rank higher and attract more traffic. Key elements include:

* **Title Tags**: Include your target keyword and make it compelling.
* **Meta Descriptions**: Write concise, engaging summaries that encourage clicks.
* **Headers (H1, H2, H3)**: Use headers to structure your content and include keywords.
* **Internal Linking**: Link to other relevant pages on your site to improve navigation and distribute link equity.

**4. Improve Page Speed**

Slow-loading pages can hurt your rankings and drive users away. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix issues that may be slowing down your site.

* **Actionable Tip**: Compress images, enable browser caching, and minimize JavaScript to improve load times.

**5. Make Your Site Mobile-Friendly**

With the majority of searches now happening on mobile devices, having a mobile-friendly website is essential. Ensure your site is responsive and provides a seamless experience across all devices.

* **Actionable Tip**: Test your site’s mobile usability using Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test tool.

**6. Build High-Quality Backlinks**

Backlinks (links from other websites to yours) are a key ranking factor. Focus on earning backlinks from authoritative, relevant sites in your niche.

* **Actionable Tip**: Use strategies like guest blogging, creating shareable content, and reaching out to influencers to build backlinks.

**7. Leverage Local SEO**

If you have a local business, optimizing for local search can drive significant organic traffic. Claim your Google My Business listing, optimize for local keywords, and encourage customer reviews.

* **Actionable Tip**: Include your location in your content and meta tags (e.g., “best coffee shop in New York City”).

**8. Use Schema Markup**

Schema markup is a type of structured data that helps search engines understand your content better. It can enhance your search listings with rich snippets, which can improve click-through rates.

* **Actionable Tip**: Add schema markup for key elements like reviews, recipes, and FAQs.

**9. Update Old Content**

Refreshing outdated content can breathe new life into old posts and help them rank higher. Update statistics, add new information, and improve readability.

* **Actionable Tip**: Identify underperforming posts using analytics tools and update them with fresh content.

**10. Promote Your Content**

Even the best content won’t drive traffic if no one knows about it. Share your content on social media, email newsletters, and online communities to increase visibility.

* **Actionable Tip**: Repurpose content into different formats (e.g., turn a blog post into a video or infographic) to reach a wider audience.

**Measuring Organic Search Traffic**

To track your progress, use tools like Google Analytics and Google Search Console. Key metrics to monitor include:

* **Organic Sessions**: The number of visits from organic search.
* **Bounce Rate**: The percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.
* **Average Session Duration**: How long visitors stay on your site.
* **Keyword Rankings**: How your target keywords are performing in search results.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Keyword Stuffing**: Overloading your content with keywords can hurt your rankings.
2. **Ignoring User Experience**: A poorly designed site can drive users away, even if your content is great.
3. **Neglecting Mobile Optimization**: Failing to optimize for mobile can cost you a significant portion of your audience.
4. **Focusing Only on Quantity**: Prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to content and backlinks.

**Conclusion**

Organic search traffic is a powerful driver of growth for any website. By understanding how search engines work and implementing proven SEO strategies, you can attract more visitors, build credibility, and achieve long-term success. Remember, SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay consistent, keep learning, and adapt to changes in search engine algorithms to maintain and grow your organic traffic over time.

1isdpqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AYPYoga/comments/1isdpqy/ayp_yoga_lesson_83_there_she_goes_kundalini_that/,"AYP Yoga - Lesson 83 - There She Goes - Kundalini, that is, by Yogani","Q: Namaste! I took to heart your advise and dropped back to 20 minutes for meditation - however, during pranayama heat and tingling came up, thought nothing of it, but as I continued in meditation heat arose from my sacral area, and continued up my spine, a high pitched buzzing rang through my ears and then a tremendous surge of energy pulsed through me. I ended meditation with a prayer and actually kept working with breath prayer, then did a 7,7,7 breath to calm down - the energy was so intense. I went out to see my husband to have him help ground me, and he could feel the energy pulsating through my hands and back as I was sitting against him - this lasted for about an hour or so. Now my question: Is this the bucking bronco you spoke of, or is this kundalini making herself known? I backed down in this morning's pranayama and meditation taking out sambhavi, mulabandha, and siddhasana. I just did spinal breathing and I AM meditation, I still felt energy pulsating and high pitched buzzing but not as intensely. My inner vision prompts me to continue in this way for 4 days, adding on sambhavi and mulabandha 2 days after the 4 day rest and see reaction, continuing onto siddhasana after I feel a balance. My quandary is this - Should I continue on with the advanced practices and try to train the bronco, or should I let the bronco relax and then try to gain control slowly? Also, FYI: Walks outside, yogic breath, belly breath and restorative poses are what I am going to use today as well as nervine herbs such as skullcap, oatstraw, and chamomile. I have eliminated coffee all together - who needs that artificial stimulation when you have this dynamo inside yourself?

A: There she goes. Kundalini, that is. The thing to do is be very intent on integrating all this into your daily activity. You are very wise not to blindly push practices ahead. Find that stable platform of practices and lifestyle that goes around the clock, 24 hours. Very important. You will know when it is time to press ahead again. The tools will be there when you need them. Your job right now is to stay on the rails. Or, as they say in rural Mississippi, ""Keep it between the ditches."" 

The ""bucking bronco"" referred to in siddhasana is sexual energy jumping around in the stimulation of the siddhasana seat. Over time, it changes and becomes very smooth and ecstatically blissful energy flowing up in the body like a fountain all the time. You seem to be making a sudden transformation, with sexual energy lurching upward into kundalini manifestation rapidly. It won't be that sudden for everyone. Everyone's nervous system is in a different condition according to past actions and practices -- that means way back before this life. You are right to stay out of siddhasana for now. And the other stimulative methods too. Don't hesitate to back off on pranayama and meditation also, if your symptoms make it necessary. You have plenty going on. Focus on stabilization. You can go back later and add stimulation into your routine when it is obvious you can use it.

Right now it is obvious you have enough to integrate. Make sure you keep physically active. This is essential for integration of kundalini energies into the nervous system. If necessary, you can also eat a heavier diet for a while to help smooth things out. Review the kundalini remedies in Lesson 69 and see if there are other avenues you are inclined to explore. It will get smoother as you continue on a course of ""grounding"" activities. Let your experience be your guide. The key to success in this stage is learning how to accommodate kundalini, and working with her. The yogi/yogini's role goes from instigator to partner. In time, you will find there is only one of you in there, and everywhere.

Keep in mind that this transformation is not an overnight thing. It is a long drawn out process that will take years to evolve. The nervous system has a lot of purification and evolution to go through. So, be prudent, patient, and settle in for the long haul. Slow and steady wins the race. We'd like to avoid having it turn into an ongoing roller coaster ride. Live a full and active life, and let your growing enlightenment live it with you. The journey can be so much fun.

1isdpm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1isdpm0/hes_upset_i_didnt_make_a_valentines_day_post/,He’s upset I didn’t make a Valentine’s Day post about him,"I’d been heavy in my emotions about the infidelity. He still doesn’t know I know. 

On Valentine’s Day, I woke up and made him coffee. We’d already exchanged very small gifts a few days beforehand because neither of us like to wait. I told him happy Valentine’s Day, he said it back. When we were sitting beside each other, I saw him scrolling through heart gifs and then send one to the person I’ve had heavy suspicions about the most. My mood soured instantly, though I didn’t say why, and he picked up on it and proceeded to love bomb me all day throughout work. 
He made multiple posts on Facebook tagging me, was repeatedly messaging me how much he loves me and how pretty he thinks I am, and after I got home from a very long day at work, he’d gotten me some half off Valentines’s themed gifts and a half dead plant. 

I want to be clear - I am very appreciative of the time he took to go shopping at the last minute and spend money, even when it’s tight, and I felt guilty for not doing the same even though we’d already given gifts days prior and told him so. 

But last night he asked me why I didn’t make a post about him on Valentine’s Day. I didn’t know what to say other than that I was busy all day and stressed at work, after working a nearly 12 hour day. Not like I could say, “well I saw you messaging someone else and the hurt consumed me all day so posting about my love for you is the last thing on my mind.”

I’m sure he is looking for validation that he is a good person and that I love him so he doesn’t have to face the reality that what he’s doing is wrong. But fuck, I’m exhausted and didn’t need him questioning me over a damn Facebook post. ",7,1739888380.0,survivinginfidelity,4,0.89,False

1isdobv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1isdobv/joe_k_part_1/,Joe K - Part 1,"The doorkeeper stood rigid in large coal-black leather boots, protruding like obsidian pillars from a long black coat, over which two giant arms and gloved hands were folded in a gesture as comfortable and relaxed as it was defensive, as if short, thin, weak Joe K could possibly be a threat to this human monolith - if it *was* human. The only anthropic evidence was the hint of two pale cheeks, flashing in and out of the shadow of his large-brimmed black Stetson, a small wart taking up residence on the southside. K could only presume the existence of a mouth hidden somewhere beneath the thick, black facial hair, and eyes hidden behind the large dark sunglasses that were unnecessary to say the least - there wasn't enough light in here for K to even guess at the dimensions of wherever *here* was. He didn't know where he was or how he'd got there. He didn't even know that such a state of affairs should be of some concern. In fact, his only concern was in gaining access to whatever was on the other side of that door. ""May I?""

""It's not your time."" Did the doorkeeper's lips move? K wasn't sure.

""When will it be my time?""

""Maybe in the future."" They moved then, didn't they?

""The future, right... um... could you be more specific?"" K focused his attention on those potential lips as if he was Moses trying to part the Red Sea, but this time the doorkeeper made no reply to K's enquiry, perhaps assuming the question was merely rhetorical... or was it too ambiguously worded? Maybe he should be more specific. ""When...?""

""The future""

""So we can rule out the past then?"" K immediately regretted resorting to sarcasm. He'd had enough experience of dealing with figures of authority to know that sarcasm was the least effective strategy one could employ, but there were no immediate reprisals. The doorkeeper remained as inanimate as ever and, when K began pacing around in the semi-darkness, politely offered him a wooden stool so he could rest his legs while he waited. So he rested his legs and waited.

After some time staring at the increasingly inviting light emanating from the open doorway, K's thoughts turned to the possibility of making a run for it. As big and strong and menacing as the doorkeeper appeared to be, he didn't look particularly fast on his feet. He'd even provided him with a potential weapon, light enough to swing and hard enough to cause his adversary some temporary inconvenience, at least. If he could just get close enough to catch him unawares, it could buy him enough time... ""I wouldn't advise it,"" the doorkeeper interrupted his thoughts. ""Mine is but a humble job, consisting of just one very simple task, but I happen to take it very seriously - as if it were a matter of life and death, you might say... not my life and death, of course. And don't let my physical appearance fool you, my reactions are lot faster than one would presume.""

""If you take it *that* seriously then perhaps you should lock the door. After all, I could just wait for you to fall asleep and...""

""Please refrain from making such vile insinuations. I have never fallen asleep, and I never will. That would be a dereliction of duty... as would closing the door - it must always remain open.""

And so it did. As the hours, days, months and years dragged on and raced by, K and the doorkeeper grew old before each others eyes, until their beard's were grey, their skin was wrinkled and their bones were bent and brittle. K's pleas became more forlorn and ritualistic over time, devoid of any expectation of success. Is it time? No. Is it time? No. All the questions he could think to ask the doorkeeper had been repeated a hundredfold without any variation in the answers, until, nearing death and lying on the floor, his failing eyesight straining into the abyss of his darkening tomb, a question sprang to his mind, as if from the abyss itself.

""How come, in all the years I've been waiting here, no one else has been through that door?""

""That would be a dereliction of duty.""

""You keep saying that, but duty to who?""

""To you, of course,"" said the doorkeeper. ""No one else can go through this door, it is just for you, and you alone.""

""For *me*? How can it exist just for me? That doesn't make sense... unless... this is a dream, isn't it?"" For the first time in all the years K had known him, there was the merest hint of a smile, probably nervous, possibly knowledgeable, encouragingly suggestive, but resistant to any further interpretation, in the twinge of his whiskers. Summoning energy from this revelation, K sat up and echoed the microscopic gesture back at him with explosive amplification. His bones no longer bent, his skin no longer wrinkled, his beard no longer grey, his eyes no longer blind, he was full of renewed energy and leapt to his feet, demanding - ""What does it mean?""

""What does what mean?""

""This dream, you big, ugly, obstinate metaphor. Dreams always mean something, everybody knows that, so what does it mean?

""There's no need to get personal,"" the doorkeeper suddenly got personable. ""And what are you asking me for, anyway? it's your dream. Maybe the door represents freedom and I'm the state imposing its bureaucratic rules on you. I am *the man* after all... too literal? Well, what if the freedom you seek is less political and more philosophical. Maybe I'm the personification of fate or destiny or something. Maybe I represent your cynical predisposition, stubbornly denying you access to the meaning of life, or maybe it's the awful truth that's behind that door and I'm your ego refusing to let you see the meaninglessness of your own existence... too deep? What if it's the door to everything you ever wanted in life - happiness, love, success, and I'm your own fear of failure stopping you from taking a chance because you're such a fucking coward?""

""I'm sorry I asked.""

""Look, maybe there's an allegory here and maybe there isn't. You dreamers are always looking for meaning. Maybe it's beyond that door... or - drum roll... maybe it *is* the door - whoa! big reveal.""

""Or maybe it's whatever I want it to be. Like you said, it's my dream, I can do what I want. If I want you to disappear, I just have to think it."" The doorkeeper disappeared, leaving the entrance unguarded. K walked towards the light, knowing that whatever was on the other side was whatever he wanted to put there, but by the time he got there, all he wanted to do was shut the door. The light beyond was extinguished and total darkness descended over him. From behind the closed door, he heard vague sounds of activity - movement, footsteps, mumbling. He opened his eyes and, in a semi-conscious daze, tried to make sense of what he could hear. It was coming from beyond his bedroom door but, unmistakably, inside his flat. He half-mumbled, half-dribbled some vague enunciation of exclamations and confused thoughts into his pillow.

As his brain swam into the deeper waters of full consciousness, the sounds acquired a more recognisable form. Kitchen cupboards opening, chinaware on the ceramic surface and draining board... was that the fridge? Male voices - ""Is that all you ever think about?""

""I skipped breakfast."" Drawers opening, cutlery, footsteps coming into the lounge, more drawers opening. The day finally dawned on K with the thought that his flat was being robbed.

There was no phone connected in his bedroom and he didn't own a mobile. Should he open his window and shout for help? ""No, 'fire',"" he whispered to himself, remembering that people don't react if you shout for help. How would the robbers react, though - fight or flight? He scanned his room in what he suspected to be a futile search for something to defend himself with. His radio? His bedside lamp? A belt? A hardback book? There wasn't much else around except clothes and more books, on shelves and in piles on the floor. Could he quietly remove some books from a detachable shelf, and use that? He couldn't remember if his shelves even were detachable and it would hardly have done him much good, anyway, there were at least two voices that he could make out, they weren't exactly being very discrete about it. Wait, did they even know he was in here? He decided that the safest thing to do was to hide under the bed, pray to providence that they didn't find him, and wait for them to go away. What did he have to steal anyway, that the insurance wouldn't cover? His books? It seemed unlikely they'd be interested in them?

Just as he was wrapping himself up in his duvet and quietly manoeuvring the human-fabric hybrid onto the floor, the opening of the bedroom door startled him into falling the remaining distance. ""Good morning, sir... What on Earth are you doing? this is no time for fun and games. Hey! come and have a look at this, we've got a right joker here."" The tall, thin, young, black policeman was soon joined by his short, fat, old, white partner and they both laughed at the man lying on his back, by the side of his bed, partially concealed in a duvet, legs in the air and a curious combination of horror, confusion and relief written on his red face. At least he wasn't being robbed. He began to cling desperately to the hope that, whatever the cause of this untimely intrusion into his quiet life, it would probably all be cleared up fairly quickly.

""He looks like a giant insect in distress,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman, discharging over the bedroom floor several small globules of extra-masticated, extra-mature cheddar. ""That's readers for you, they get all sorts of crazy ideas. Look, there's even *more* books in here, he must have thousands of them.""

""Thousands of books and no computer... that's interesting."" They swapped exaggerated expressions, as if to suggest to a non-existent television audience that the character half of them had already come to suspect, in spite of all the obvious evidence pointing elsewhere, did, after all, fit the profile.

""What's this all about?"" K assumed was a reasonable question to ask, as causally as he could manage, while de-quilting and standing up. So casual, it turned out, that he was completely ignored. He observed the policemen examining his books, paying particular attention to the covers and occasionally flicking through the pages, as he slipped on a pair of blue jeans and a grey t-shirt. The tall, thin, young, black policeman had a neck so long and thin that it even managed to look out of place on *his* torso, giving him the appearance of a child's bendy rubber toy. His bulging fisheyes were another aspect of his appearance that contrasted with his partner's, whose own eyes were so tiny and deep-set as to be almost hidden. Their uniforms, although standard attire, were a size too large and a size too small, as if in a Keystonesque concession towards homogeneity. They each wore a body-cam on their chests and a taser in their belts. Cautiously, and with due respect, K tried again - ""Excuse me, gentlemen, but could you tell me what this is all about, please?""

""Not our job, sir,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman.

""Not our job, sir,"" said the tall, thin, young, black policeman.

""Well, what is your job?"" K blurted out, from behind his poorly constructed facade of civility. Suddenly they were both defensively and suspiciously staring at him, their hands resting on their tasers. ""Sorry, sorry... I don't mean to rude, gentlemen, I realise what your job title is, you don't have to remind me, it's just... I mean... in this particular instance... what...uh... is your job?""

""This is, sir,"" said the tall, thin, black policeman, holding up a book to emphasise the point.

""This is, sir,"" said the short, fat, white policeman, holding up another book to re-emphasise the same point. ""Look, we don't come around to your workplace, disturbing you, do we? What is your job, anyway, a fucking librarian?""

""I'm a cleaner. My name is Joe K. I can show you my identification.""

Entering his lounge was like walking onto a recently deserted battlefield, his books the dead soldiers of a brutal civil war between fiction and non-fiction. He half-expected to see Abraham Lincoln stood on the coffee table delivering the Gutenberg Address. Resisting the urge to help the wounded, he retrieved his Clean Knows ID from the sideboard and returned to the bedroom, where he proudly presented it to the police officers, as if it would magically put their minds, and manners, at ease. They both gave it a cursory glance and handed it back without a word. ""And may I be so bold as to ask you gentlemen to reciprocate?""

""Recipe cake?"" said the tall, thin, young, black policeman, his focus on something that had caught his attention in *The Savage Detectives*.

""A cleaner who reads,"" said the short, fat, old, white policeman, shaking his head at the I've-seen-it-all-now sheer absurdity of such a concept.

""Could you show me some identification, please? I believe it's within my rights."" They rolled their contrasting eyes and reluctantly complied with the request. The tall, thin, young, black policeman was Inspector Wire and the short, fat, old, white policeman was Inspector Womble. K thought he was finally taking a step in the right direction and was hoping to continue proceedings in a spirit of mutual cooperation. ""Thank you. Now, are you sure I can't be of any assistance? I'm sure, if you tell me what this is all about...""

""Not our job, sir"" said Inspector Womble.

""Not our job, sir"" said Inspector Wire.

""It's just, I think there must have been some kind of mistake.""

""Mistake, sir?"" said Inspector Wire.

""Mistake, sir?"" said Inspector Womble.

""I see... I suppose the police never make mistakes, right?""

""Oh, we make mistakes all the time, don't we Inspector Womble?""

""We sure do, Inspector Wire, all the time. Nobody's perfect.""

""It's just that there are procedures, you see sir? Now is not the time for correcting mistakes, these things have to be dealt with at the appropriate time.""

""Through the appropriate channels.""

""In the appropriate manner.""

""By the appropriate representatives. It's not...""

""Not your job, right?... Your job is to check my books, right?""

""We can conduct a preliminary investigation, yes,"" said Inspector Wire. ""But, all these books will have to be sent to the forensic lab for further analysis.""

""Forensic lab?... Further analysis? Wait, you think one of my books might be... a murder weapon? You think I...?"" K became light-headed and felt the urgent need to lie down, but the act achieved little more than the prevention of him passing out.

Thoughts were spinning wildly around his head for several minutes before he wrestled one into submission and queued the rest of them up into some vaguely manageable order. Why on Earth would anyone think I've murdered someone? it doesn't make any sense, I'm not capable of murder... What am I talking about? everyone's capable of murder, given the right set of circumstances, isn't that what they say? What else do they say? means, motive and opportunity. Let's be objective about this - who *could* I have murdered? And why? He thought of his friends and family, but opportunity alone made family an easy possibility to dismiss, and for anyone for who he was still close enough to be considered a friend to, motive was unthinkable. He thought of his regular clients, the people whose houses he cleaned. The Montgomery's? Quinn and Richard? Mrs Henry? There was motive *and* opportunity with Mrs Henry. She always tries to pay him out of that stash she's got hidden in a biscuit tin, before he reminds her of the direct debit she's got set up with Clean Knows. Then he reminds her what a direct debit is. Then he reminds her that he's not her nephew, the chef who comes around to cook for her sometimes - none of that overpriced rubbish he cooks in that fancy restaurant, mind, she won't eat any of that, but he's a good lad, he's the only one who still comes around to see her. ""Shit!"" said K. ""Did he bludgeon his poor, defenceless aunt to death with a thick hardback for her life savings?"" This croaked utterance revealing how dry his throat had become, he slowly got up and headed to the kitchen.

""Don't go thinking about making a run for it,"" said Inspector Womble, tapping the taser in his belt. ""My pursuing days might be behind me but, the last time I checked Wikipedia, electricity still travels at the speed of light.""

K picked a glass from the smorgasbord of glasses, cups, plates, cutlery and utensils spread across his kitchen surfaces like a contemporary art installation, and turned on the tap. The first glass he instinctively poured over his head and he drank the second while surveying the former contents of his cupboards. Were all these items now considered potential murder weapons, soon to be taken to the lab for forensic analysis? He wondered if offering the inspectors coffee made him look more or less guilty. Then he wondered if wondering whether you looked more or less guilty made you look more or less guilty. He suspected that innocent suspects worry more than guilty suspects about whether they look more or less guilty. White with four sugars for Inspector Womble, straight black for Inspector Wire, the same as K took his.

On the couch, he stared at the blank TV screen and imagined himself portrayed in a courtroom drama, with Idris Elba playing the smooth-talking, hard-as-nails, lawyer tearing him to pieces and convincing the jury of his guilt in a gross miscarriage of justice that only becomes apparent years after he's been stabbed to death by Tom Hardy in the showers on D wing. They'll probably get one of the hobbits to play me, he thought, but not the main one. He was busy casting Olivia Colman as the journalist who relentlessly pursues the truth against all the odds, on behalf of nobody in particular, when Inspector Wire walked into the lounge and picked up K's coffee by mistake, not that it made any difference, except - ""Shouldn't you be wearing gloves?""

""What's that supposed to mean?""

""Nothing... it's just... you said my books were being sent for forensic analysis, aren't you worried about cross contamination or something?""

""Not... scientific analysis, you know... literary analysis.""

""*Literary*...? You think one of these books *inspired* me to commit a murder?""

""Murder?"" said Inspector Womble, joining them from the bedroom. ""Did I just hear a confession?""

""Did you just confess to a murder, sir?"" said Inspector Wire.

""No,"" said K.

""So, you haven't murdered anyone then, sir?"" said Inspector Womble.

""No!"" said K.

""Are you sure, sir?"" said Inspector Wire. ""Only, we wouldn't want to miss something like that, it's rather a big deal in our profession, isn't it Inspector Womble?""

""It sure is, Inspector Wire. I mean, if we missed something like that, we'd be getting stick down at the station for weeks, and you wouldn't want that, would you, sir?""

""Uh... no,"" said K.

""So, just to be clear, you definitely haven't murdered anyone?"" said Inspector Womble.

""No!""

""Not even a little accidental manslaughter?"" said Inspector Wire. ""It's nothing to be ashamed of, sir, it's a easy mistake to make, we've all done it.""

""You're taking the piss, aren't you? I'm not being arrested for murder, am I?""

""No, sir, you're not being arrested for murder,"" said Inspector Womble. ""Now, could I just ask you to fill in this brief questionnaire?"" He dropped a handheld computer onto K's lap, causing two consecutive knee-jerk reactions - a literal one of the instinctive genital protection variety, and a metaphorical one at the sight of the device. K avoided modern technology as much as he could and secretly longed for a return to the sweet inconvenience of the good old days, before the rise of the machines. He'd learnt to tolerate computers but that was as good as their relationship was ever going to get. The screen asked him how satisfied he was with the service provided today by Inspectors Wire and Womble from *Extremely Satisfied* to *Extremely Unsatisfied*, the beaming smiles of the friendly police officers looming over him. He was unable to stop his eyes drifting briefly over the mess in his flat before he clicked *Extremely Satisfied* and quickly worked his way through the rest of the form. The inspectors were *Extremely Respectful*, he felt *Sufficiently At Ease* with the process, it was conducted *Extremely Efficiently*, he felt *Completely Unthreatened,* there was *No Physical Contact* and he didn't have any additional comments or helpful suggestions for improving the service. He handed the device back to Inspector Womble, keen to bring the morning's unexpected, and increasingly bizarre, ordeal to its conclusion. ""Thank you, sir.""

""Drink up then, sir, it's time to go,"" said Inspector Wire, finishing his own coffee.

""Huh? Where are we going?""

""To the station, of course, you're being arrested.""

""*Arrested*? But he said...""

""You really should learn to pay attention, sir. He said you weren't being arrested for murder, he didn't say you weren't being arrested. Now, you're not going to give us any more trouble, are you? We've been very patient with you, so far, especially considering your astounding ignorance of the law and your generally uncooperative behaviour. You've been one of our most difficult clients in all the time we've been working together, which is what - six years?""

""Nearly seven. You've not been very hospitable, sir,"" Inspector Womble felt the need to point out as he dunked a digestive biscuit in his coffee. ""As your answers to the questionnaire prove, you've been having a great time, while this has been an *extremely* stressful experience for us, and your lack of empathy certainly hasn't helped matters. After all those endless questions, the least you can do is come quietly.""

""I will, I promise,"" said K. ""But, can I just ask one last question?"" The policemen exchanged a look, shrugged their shoulders, and waited. ""Can you just tell me what I *am* being arrested for?""

""Not our job, sir,"" said Inspector Wire.

""Not our job, sir,"" said Inspector Womble.",1,1739888281.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

1isdm0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1isdm0o/f4f_lets_create_an_epic_fantasy_story_in_an_urban/,[F4F] Let's create an epic fantasy story in an urban fantasy world! [Adv.lit.][Discord],"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

# The preamble...

Okay, so... let me preface the whole thing with this: this whole ad is going to be pretty long. So, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and get comfortable!

Why would I write such a long advert? That's simple. As long as it can take to read something that long, it doesn't even compare to the waste of time up to possibly **weeks** worth of planning, because you and the other person found out you are incompatible, whether be it a huge thing or small! Which the length of this very advert seeks to prevent, to the best of its ability! So, as daunting as the size of that scroll bar may seem, I'd be most obliged if you read the whole thing before messaging me!

I am, generally speaking, able to tell when someone hasn't, so if you message me without reading, it's not very likely to go anywhere!

Still, the basic idea of what I'm looking for is epic adventure with high stakes and a wide, ensemble cast, with a lot of the archetypical tropes you'd stumble upon medieval (or generally pre-industrial) fantasy, except that it all happens within a post-industrial setting! If you like epic adventure, angst, drama, fluff, action and high stakes all packed into one, and are a decently active responder, there's a fair chance that the two of us may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

I also prefer not to write with men at the moment.

Okay, why don't I carry on?

# The introductions!

Okay, with all that behind me, let me get the basic introductions out of the way!

I'm a female roleplayer aged 23, that hails from the dark, mysterious lands as Eastern Europe! More specifically, I come from Poland, which some people say is from Central Europe. In any case, this means that I happen to be situated in the CET time zone! I've been doing this hobby for a solid half of my life by this point, and while only a fraction of that time has actually been in English, I still consider myself to be a decent writer! Other than writing, I also love anime, j-RPGs, all sorts of fantasy fiction, tea, and anything that happens to have fur and four legs!

I'm also transgender. As this is my personal account first, and my partner-searching account second, it's pretty easy stuff to find on my profile regardless, so I may as well put it out there. If that's a problem, then do me a kindness, and please don't message me!

I am also for whom good OOC is not only important, but pretty much required. Yes, this does mean that, preferably, I prefer to befriend my writing partners over time! That's not however all that there is to it. To me, the whole OOC surrounding the roleplay, the endless discussions about the plot, the fan-girling, the what-ifs, jokes and memes even up to the point of outright mockery of serious, heart-wrenching story moments are all par of the course with me! All of that, and more, is pretty much half of where the fun of this hobby comes from! If all of this sounds fun, then that's great! On the other hand however, if all this sounds like gruelling nonsense to you, I'm afraid that we aren't meant to be!

And, well! Before I carry on with further sections, there's a couple of things I need to bring up, first:

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, or older. 
2. I require the reply rate of at least once per day, and the ability to write more often is appreciated, as well as preferred. Real-life always comes first, which goes without saying, but if you know this is going to be an issue, I'm not the right writing partner for you.
3. I only roleplay via Discord, and at the moment, I'm not interested in any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face-claims of any kind. Reference images for monsters, places, weapons and other objects are something I'm a great deal more agreeable to!
5. As bad as I feel to say this, I'm not willing to give inexperienced writers a shot. Please don't take this personally if you are such, and I wish you the best of luck out there with somebody else!
6. At the moment, I also prefer not to write with men. 
7. NFSW, the way the term is typically understood within the community, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, it's unlikely that I'll respond.

That... should be about it, I think!

Please note that none of the things above are up to a compromise or negotiation. You're especially going to make a bad first impression if you lead with the last thing I'd mentioned. Though, I am willing to elaborate on any one of these, should there be any confusion!

Anyway, let me carry on!

# Literacy!

This will be relatively short and sweet!

While I don't really believe in labels, if I were to use one, that'd be advanced literate! My replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words, but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get quite a bit longer than that! Still, I wouldn't quite call myself novella, and my opinion on the more poetic, flowery sort of language is that it's a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not really if you dump the whole package into the pot! Oh, and I write in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners.

I will happily exchange writing samples in private messages!

That's pretty much it on that front! Let me carry on!

# Onto the plot!

Okay, so let me state that I always, in a way, come empty-handed and that's by design.

Why? That's simple! To me, the beauty of this hobby is creating something unique and special with the other person! I want to come up with everything, be it the setting, the characters, the plot, and more with my writing partner! The main exception to this are mainly monsters that I may, or may not shamelessly steal from mythology and pop-culture! I'm aware that this isn't a perfect approach, nor an approach that works for everyone, but I don't believe in perfect and this is what works best for me!

This also means that should you come to me with a detailed world or story idea, I won't be very interested. Though, if you have one, I still wish you the best luck with it!

In any case, as I have mentioned in the 'little' preamble in the beginning, what I want to write is a fantasy epic! A story full of action, high stakes, personal drama and angst, tragedy, but also friendship, love, and all that is good in the world! I love larger than life stories, where our heroes will have to battle a fearsome evil that may seem unbeatable at first! So, the standard fare for a high fantasy story, except that I want all of that to happen in a modern setting! I still tend to use a great deal of tropes and other storytelling conventions common in medieval fantasy. I just like to put them under a more modern lens!

Still, what does urban fantasy mean to me? To me specifically, I want a world where magic is NOT something that ordinary people have no knowledge or clue about, but something that is combined and intertwined with everything else within the world! How advanced is our world is something that I'm much more flexible on. It shouldn't be less advanced than the steam engine (and, more importantly, the train!) and it shouldn't be so advanced that civilizations can freely hop from galaxy to galaxy! I am open to pretty much anything in between!

I also really will not consider any sort of pre-industrial fantasy at the time.

On top of that, I'll add that I prefer stories that are generally structured a lot like a DnD campaign or a jRPG video game. That being that other than just our two lead characters, they'll eventually form a party to make up for each other's strength and weaknesses, where they will travel from place to place, and face off against all sorts of dangers and thinking antagonists!

Which, speaking of! The characters!

# The characters!

As I have mentioned prior, I love a good ensemble cast!

Which is also something that I outright require. That being, the ability to write characters that differ by gender, age\*, romantic orientation, social background, personality and moral alignment! Is this a tall order? Perhaps, but I offer the same from my end! I love to explore a wealth of inter-character dynamics, and while we will have a pair of lead characters (or protagonists, if you will!), there can only be so much story between just two people!

\*That said, our characters should be all at least 21+ years old, if not 25+ outright.

As for my lead character... we'll see!

I basically never have a pre-prepared idea of whom will I write. A couple of things that are certain is that she'll be a woman, and more likely than not, in her late 20s at the youngest. She'll also be skilled in at least some form of combat, in order to survive the hurdles set by the story! Which, all of these points I require for your character as well! Well, maybe except for the age thing. Maybe! While us playing young adults in the main roles isn't entirely off the table, it's not my preference, and I cannot promise I'll be willing to go down that road!

Please also let me reiterate that I'm *really* not interested in writing against male characters.

As for romance... right! Romance!

# Romance!

As this is what makes or breaks the roleplay for many people, I've figured it may deserve its own section!

My overall stance on romance is this: I enjoy it, I love to write it, and I wouldn't want to write a story when there's no romance whatsoever!

However, romance for me personally, should stay in the realm of a sub-plot. Of course, this doesn't mean that it cannot feature into the main plot at all costs! That'd be silly! However, my preference is that if we were to one day suddenly just decide to excise the romance from the story, that we should still be left with a functional, coherent and intact storyline! Related to our lead characters in particular, I prefer a slow-burn approach. It's not a 'do or die' kind of preference; we'll see once our story actually develops! However, it's very unlikely that I'll be willing to let them become a couple quickly, so please take this into account before you reach out!

Oh, right. While I am only interested in FxF for the lead pair, I still prefer partners willing to write FxM/MxF and MxM for all the other characters! Why? That's simple! I like variety, and to me it's neither enjoyable, nor immersive when there's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

So, to sum it up... if you're a 'no romance' roleplayer, I am definitely not the right fit for you.

At the same time, if you want a plot that's completely built around romance, I'm not the right writing partner for you, either.

To reiterate: romance can (and should) be important for our characters, and it absolutely can have a fair amount of page time. I am just not interested in plots that entirely or mostly revolve around romance. That's all!

# Action, action scenes, and the overall art of our characters getting themselves hurt!

Okay, so the biggest thing is... action!

I love action, and with me, it's not going to be the most realistic thing. Putting it this way: my characters would typically amount to little more than cannon fodder in the especially overpowered 'verses, such as the Invincible or Dragon Ball, but they would still count as OP if you put them into grounded, realistic settings! Things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of modern armed soldiers, warriors that fight on in spite of grievous injuries and literal parrying of bullets are all par of the course!

While there is some window for compromise, it's not very wide. I don't particularly enjoy realistic, grounded action. Especially since despite my preference for urban fantasy, I still prefer for fights to be done with swords and sorcery over gunslinging matches.

I would say that the action in the following series is more or less what I would want:

Vinland Saga (on the more conservative end), Fullmetal Alchemist, Castlevania (the Netflix series) and Inuyasha! (on the more whacky end...)

Obviously, action isn't the end all and be all of collaborative writing to me, buuut... if you don't like writing action scenes, then I can basically guarantee we are not going to work out as writing partners. If you do love action however, then that's great!

# What I will not write, and my creative inspirations!

So, let me just say this:

There's very, very few storytelling tropes that I refuse to use no matter what, and tropes that I straight-up hate. However, the examples liste below are what I typically dislike in fiction, and I am rarely ever willing to implement. Those would be the following:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt (e.x. pirates that don't do much actual pirating), romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment, police and military settings, 

Going back to what I said earlier! As an example, let's take the werewolf and vampire plots. I do not dislike either vampires or were-creatures, and I am actually open to including them in stories. However, I do dislike stories where these are the only fantastical creatures, if not fantastical elements as a whole and the entire story is either about a war between them or their tribe/pack politics. Still, I'm not completely against including such creatures! So, if you'd like for me to elaborate on any of these, please feel more than free to ask!

Now, onto my writing inspirations!

While I do not write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania (the animated series, not the games), Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a somewhat descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

# In conclusion!

Okay, I think this is pretty much it!

As I've said, this was long. If you've made it this far, kudos to you!

So, when you message me, I'm absolutely not expecting a university-grade essay! What I would like to know is: how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!) and most importantly, a starting pitch for the story! This whole god-forsaken advert could be summed up as 'idk, we'll see, hmu', so I am really not expecting much! What matters is a starting point, so that we may gauge each other's compatibility! I will also want to stay here for a while, before I'm comfortable with moving onto Discord. So, while I'm not going to complain if you hit me with your Discord handle, it's not very likely I'll add you right away.

Okay, that's pretty much everything!

I hope that whoever's reading it, that you have a great day, or night!",1,1739888103.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,0.99,False
1isdlo5,https://v.redd.it/swfh4qbjowje1,When Is the Best Time to Ask Specific Types of Questions?,"Unlock the Power of Perfect Timing to Get the Answers You Need

Timing, as they say, is everything—even when it comes to asking questions. Whether you’re trying to land a job, spark a thought-provoking conversation, or avoid being ignored in a crowded Slack channel, when you ask a question can greatly influence the kind of answer you receive.

In fact, research shows that human productivity, focus, and even willingness to help others fluctuate throughout the day. By aligning your questions with these natural rhythms, you can increase your chances of getting useful, timely, and thoughtful responses.

Here’s a data-backed deep dive into the best times to ask different types of questions—so you never have to hear, “Can we circle back to this later?” again.

1. Professional Questions: Timing Your Queries at Work
🔹 Best Time to Ask: Mid-morning or mid-afternoon on weekdays (9:30–11:30 AM & 1:30–3:30 PM)

Why?
Studies on workplace productivity suggest that cognitive performance follows a predictable pattern throughout the day:

Early mornings (before 9:30 AM): People prioritize urgent tasks and, let’s be honest, their coffee.
Lunchtime (12–1 PM): Energy dips as people take breaks and unwind.
Afternoons (after 3:30 PM): Fatigue sets in, leading to reduced focus and slower response times.

🔍 Supporting Data:

A study published in the Harvard Business Review found that workers are most productive between 9 AM and 12 PM and experience a second energy boost in the early afternoon before declining later in the day.
According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index, workers check email and respond to messages most frequently at 10 AM and 2 PM, meaning your question is more likely to be seen and answered during these windows.

💡 Pro Tip:

On Mondays, wait until after 10 AM—people are catching up on emails.
On Fridays, ask before 2 PM—most people mentally check out for the weekend.

2. Social Questions: The Art of Conversation
🔹 Best Time to Ask: Evenings or weekends (7–9 PM on weekdays, weekend afternoons)

When it comes to casual or personal questions, context matters. Research suggests that people are more likely to engage in deep, meaningful conversations when they’re relaxed and free from work-related stress.

🔍 Supporting Data:

A study from Brigham Young University found that social interactions tend to be more engaging and meaningful in the evenings, as people shift into a more relaxed state.
Psychology Today reports that people feel more open to reflective conversations when they’re unwinding, such as during dinner or weekend downtime.

💡 Pro Tip:

Texting a friend for advice? Try 7–9 PM on a weekday, when they’re unwinding.
Casual chat over hobbies or relationships? Weekend brunch or early afternoon is ideal.

🚨 Avoid: Serious personal questions late at night, unless you’re both in a midnight existential crisis together.

3. Academic Questions: Getting Help on School or Research Topics
🔹 Best Time to Ask: Office hours or early evenings before deadlines

Professors, TAs, and mentors set office hours for a reason—they’ve carved out time for questions. If you need help, that’s your best bet.

However, let’s be real: if you’re cramming the night before a deadline, you might need to ask for help later in the evening. Just don’t expect a cheerful response if your email timestamp reads 3:00 AM.

🔍 Supporting Data:

A study by Education Week found that students who attend office hours and ask questions during afternoon sessions (1–5 PM) report higher academic performance than those who rely on last-minute help.
Research from The National Sleep Foundation shows that cognitive function starts to decline after 9 PM, meaning you may not get the best answer (or retain it).

💡 Timing Hack:

For study groups or brainstorming: Late afternoons (3–5 PM) tend to work well, aligning with most people’s energy levels.

4. Customer Support or Business-Related Questions
🔹 Best Time to Ask: Mid-week, mid-morning (Tuesday–Thursday, 10–11 AM)

If you want a faster, more helpful response from customer service, aim for mid-week, mid-morning.

🔍 Supporting Data:

A report from Zendesk found that customer service response times are fastest between 10–11 AM on weekdays, before the queue builds up.
Research from HubSpot indicates that customer inquiries sent on Mondays take 30% longer to receive a response compared to those sent on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

🚨 Avoid:

Mondays (too much backlog from the weekend).
Fridays (that ""let’s wrap this up and go home"" energy).

💡 Bonus Tip: Use live chat tools early in the day before customer queues increase.

5. Life’s Big Questions: Philosophical and Personal Clarity
🔹 Best Time to Ask: Late at night (9 PM–12 AM) or early morning (6–8 AM)

Deep conversations about life, love, and whether pineapple belongs on pizza often happen when people feel introspective.

🔍 Supporting Data:

A study published in Scientific Reports found that people are more emotionally open and reflective late at night, making it an ideal time for philosophical discussions.
Neuroscience research from the University of California suggests that the brain’s ""default mode network""—responsible for self-reflection and deep thought—is most active during early mornings and late nights.

💡 Quirky Fact: The phrase ""nothing good happens after midnight"" doesn't apply to deep thinkers—midnight is practically happy hour for philosophers.

Why Timing Matters
Timing your questions not only respects others' availability but also increases the likelihood of getting a thoughtful and timely response. People are more receptive when they’re not distracted, overwhelmed, or hangry (hungry + angry, the ultimate productivity killer).

🔹 What if I have to ask at an “off” time?
No problem! Just adjust expectations:

If you email at 11 PM, it’s fine—just don’t expect an immediate reply.
If the timing isn’t ideal, add context: ""I know this might not be the best time, but I really need a quick answer about XYZ. Could you let me know when it’s convenient?""

Conclusion
Knowing when to ask questions can make the difference between getting ignored and getting a great answer. From work-related queries to existential musings, being mindful of timing is just as important as how you phrase your question.

Asking the right question at the wrong time is like showing up to a dinner party at 2 PM—awkward and ineffective. Be thoughtful, and you'll get answers worth waiting for.

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

# The preamble...

Okay, so... let me preface the whole thing with this: this whole ad is going to be pretty long. So, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and get comfortable!

Why would I write such a long advert? That's simple. As long as it can take to read something that long, it doesn't even compare to the waste of time up to possibly **weeks** worth of planning, because you and the other person found out you are incompatible, whether be it a huge thing or small! Which the length of this very advert seeks to prevent, to the best of its ability! So, as daunting as the size of that scroll bar may seem, I'd be most obliged if you read the whole thing before messaging me!

I am, generally speaking, able to tell when someone hasn't, so if you message me without reading, it's not very likely to go anywhere!

Still, the basic idea of what I'm looking for is epic adventure with high stakes and a wide, ensemble cast, with a lot of the archetypical tropes you'd stumble upon medieval (or generally pre-industrial) fantasy, except that it all happens within a post-industrial setting! If you like epic adventure, angst, drama, fluff, action and high stakes all packed into one, and are a decently active responder, there's a fair chance that the two of us may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

I also prefer not to write with men at the moment.

Okay, why don't I carry on?

# The introductions!

Okay, with all that behind me, let me get the basic introductions out of the way!

I'm a female roleplayer aged 23, that hails from the dark, mysterious lands as Eastern Europe! More specifically, I come from Poland, which some people say is from Central Europe. In any case, this means that I happen to be situated in the CET time zone! I've been doing this hobby for a solid half of my life by this point, and while only a fraction of that time has actually been in English, I still consider myself to be a decent writer! Other than writing, I also love anime, j-RPGs, all sorts of fantasy fiction, tea, and anything that happens to have fur and four legs!

I'm also transgender. As this is my personal account first, and my partner-searching account second, it's pretty easy stuff to find on my profile regardless, so I may as well put it out there. If that's a problem, then do me a kindness, and please don't message me!

I am also for whom good OOC is not only important, but pretty much required. Yes, this does mean that, preferably, I prefer to befriend my writing partners over time! That's not however all that there is to it. To me, the whole OOC surrounding the roleplay, the endless discussions about the plot, the fan-girling, the what-ifs, jokes and memes even up to the point of outright mockery of serious, heart-wrenching story moments are all par of the course with me! All of that, and more, is pretty much half of where the fun of this hobby comes from! If all of this sounds fun, then that's great! On the other hand however, if all this sounds like gruelling nonsense to you, I'm afraid that we aren't meant to be!

And, well! Before I carry on with further sections, there's a couple of things I need to bring up, first:

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, or older. 
2. I require the reply rate of at least once per day, and the ability to write more often is appreciated, as well as preferred. Real-life always comes first, which goes without saying, but if you know this is going to be an issue, I'm not the right writing partner for you.
3. I only roleplay via Discord, and at the moment, I'm not interested in any alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face-claims of any kind. Reference images for monsters, places, weapons and other objects are something I'm a great deal more agreeable to!
5. As bad as I feel to say this, I'm not willing to give inexperienced writers a shot. Please don't take this personally if you are such, and I wish you the best of luck out there with somebody else!
6. At the moment, I also prefer not to write with men. 
7. NFSW, the way the term is typically understood within the community, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, it's unlikely that I'll respond.

That... should be about it, I think!

Please note that none of the things above are up to a compromise or negotiation. You're especially going to make a bad first impression if you lead with the last thing I'd mentioned. Though, I am willing to elaborate on any one of these, should there be any confusion!

Anyway, let me carry on!

# Literacy!

This will be relatively short and sweet!

While I don't really believe in labels, if I were to use one, that'd be advanced literate! My replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words, but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get quite a bit longer than that! Still, I wouldn't quite call myself novella, and my opinion on the more poetic, flowery sort of language is that it's a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not really if you dump the whole package into the pot! Oh, and I write in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners.

I will happily exchange writing samples in private messages!

That's pretty much it on that front! Let me carry on!

# Onto the plot!

Okay, so let me state that I always, in a way, come empty-handed and that's by design.

Why? That's simple! To me, the beauty of this hobby is creating something unique and special with the other person! I want to come up with everything, be it the setting, the characters, the plot, and more with my writing partner! The main exception to this are mainly monsters that I may, or may not shamelessly steal from mythology and pop-culture! I'm aware that this isn't a perfect approach, nor an approach that works for everyone, but I don't believe in perfect and this is what works best for me!

This also means that should you come to me with a detailed world or story idea, I won't be very interested. Though, if you have one, I still wish you the best luck with it!

In any case, as I have mentioned in the 'little' preamble in the beginning, what I want to write is a fantasy epic! A story full of action, high stakes, personal drama and angst, tragedy, but also friendship, love, and all that is good in the world! I love larger than life stories, where our heroes will have to battle a fearsome evil that may seem unbeatable at first! So, the standard fare for a high fantasy story, except that I want all of that to happen in a modern setting! I still tend to use a great deal of tropes and other storytelling conventions common in medieval fantasy. I just like to put them under a more modern lens!

Still, what does urban fantasy mean to me? To me specifically, I want a world where magic is NOT something that ordinary people have no knowledge or clue about, but something that is combined and intertwined with everything else within the world! How advanced is our world is something that I'm much more flexible on. It shouldn't be less advanced than the steam engine (and, more importantly, the train!) and it shouldn't be so advanced that civilizations can freely hop from galaxy to galaxy! I am open to pretty much anything in between!

I also really will not consider any sort of pre-industrial fantasy at the time.

On top of that, I'll add that I prefer stories that are generally structured a lot like a DnD campaign or a jRPG video game. That being that other than just our two lead characters, they'll eventually form a party to make up for each other's strength and weaknesses, where they will travel from place to place, and face off against all sorts of dangers and thinking antagonists!

Which, speaking of! The characters!

# The characters!

As I have mentioned prior, I love a good ensemble cast!

Which is also something that I outright require. That being, the ability to write characters that differ by gender, age\*, romantic orientation, social background, personality and moral alignment! Is this a tall order? Perhaps, but I offer the same from my end! I love to explore a wealth of inter-character dynamics, and while we will have a pair of lead characters (or protagonists, if you will!), there can only be so much story between just two people!

\*That said, our characters should be all at least 21+ years old, if not 25+ outright.

As for my lead character... we'll see!

I basically never have a pre-prepared idea of whom will I write. A couple of things that are certain is that she'll be a woman, and more likely than not, in her late 20s at the youngest. She'll also be skilled in at least some form of combat, in order to survive the hurdles set by the story! Which, all of these points I require for your character as well! Well, maybe except for the age thing. Maybe! While us playing young adults in the main roles isn't entirely off the table, it's not my preference, and I cannot promise I'll be willing to go down that road!

Please also let me reiterate that I'm *really* not interested in writing against male characters.

As for romance... right! Romance!

# Romance!

As this is what makes or breaks the roleplay for many people, I've figured it may deserve its own section!

My overall stance on romance is this: I enjoy it, I love to write it, and I wouldn't want to write a story when there's no romance whatsoever!

However, romance for me personally, should stay in the realm of a sub-plot. Of course, this doesn't mean that it cannot feature into the main plot at all costs! That'd be silly! However, my preference is that if we were to one day suddenly just decide to excise the romance from the story, that we should still be left with a functional, coherent and intact storyline! Related to our lead characters in particular, I prefer a slow-burn approach. It's not a 'do or die' kind of preference; we'll see once our story actually develops! However, it's very unlikely that I'll be willing to let them become a couple quickly, so please take this into account before you reach out!

Oh, right. While I am only interested in FxF for the lead pair, I still prefer partners willing to write FxM/MxF and MxM for all the other characters! Why? That's simple! I like variety, and to me it's neither enjoyable, nor immersive when there's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

So, to sum it up... if you're a 'no romance' roleplayer, I am definitely not the right fit for you.

At the same time, if you want a plot that's completely built around romance, I'm not the right writing partner for you, either.

To reiterate: romance can (and should) be important for our characters, and it absolutely can have a fair amount of page time. I am just not interested in plots that entirely or mostly revolve around romance. That's all!

# Action, action scenes, and the overall art of our characters getting themselves hurt!

Okay, so the biggest thing is... action!

I love action, and with me, it's not going to be the most realistic thing. Putting it this way: my characters would typically amount to little more than cannon fodder in the especially overpowered 'verses, such as the Invincible or Dragon Ball, but they would still count as OP if you put them into grounded, realistic settings! Things such as swordsmen cutting through scores of modern armed soldiers, warriors that fight on in spite of grievous injuries and literal parrying of bullets are all par of the course!

While there is some window for compromise, it's not very wide. I don't particularly enjoy realistic, grounded action. Especially since despite my preference for urban fantasy, I still prefer for fights to be done with swords and sorcery over gunslinging matches.

I would say that the action in the following series is more or less what I would want:

Vinland Saga (on the more conservative end), Fullmetal Alchemist, Castlevania (the Netflix series) and Inuyasha! (on the more whacky end...)

Obviously, action isn't the end all and be all of collaborative writing to me, buuut... if you don't like writing action scenes, then I can basically guarantee we are not going to work out as writing partners. If you do love action however, then that's great!

# What I will not write, and my creative inspirations!

So, let me just say this:

There's very, very few storytelling tropes that I refuse to use no matter what, and tropes that I straight-up hate. However, the examples liste below are what I typically dislike in fiction, and I am rarely ever willing to implement. Those would be the following:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt (e.x. pirates that don't do much actual pirating), romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment, police and military settings, 

Going back to what I said earlier! As an example, let's take the werewolf and vampire plots. I do not dislike either vampires or were-creatures, and I am actually open to including them in stories. However, I do dislike stories where these are the only fantastical creatures, if not fantastical elements as a whole and the entire story is either about a war between them or their tribe/pack politics. Still, I'm not completely against including such creatures! So, if you'd like for me to elaborate on any of these, please feel more than free to ask!

Now, onto my writing inspirations!

While I do not write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Castlevania (the animated series, not the games), Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a somewhat descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

# In conclusion!

Okay, I think this is pretty much it!

As I've said, this was long. If you've made it this far, kudos to you!

So, when you message me, I'm absolutely not expecting a university-grade essay! What I would like to know is: how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!) and most importantly, a starting pitch for the story! This whole god-forsaken advert could be summed up as 'idk, we'll see, hmu', so I am really not expecting much! What matters is a starting point, so that we may gauge each other's compatibility! I will also want to stay here for a while, before I'm comfortable with moving onto Discord. So, while I'm not going to complain if you hit me with your Discord handle, it's not very likely I'll add you right away.

Okay, that's pretty much everything!

I hope that whoever's reading it, that you have a great day, or night!",1,1739888053.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,0.99,False
