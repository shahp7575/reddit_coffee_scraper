i’ve just started working in a new location, where the owner has taken over a previous cafe. since starting there, there’s been many customers who will come up to us staff with an attitude, interrogating us about so many things. “do you even make good coffee? why did the previous owner leave ?😠”oftentimes asking us questions we simply don’t have answers to, questions where the only answer is “idk we just work here”

how do you deal with it? i find it hard to stand up for myself without stuttering and i often jumble my words. i hate feeling like i need to justify myself and my work to people who have a some weird problem with it

The sun is shining, the sky is an expanse of blue with far fewer clouds than there have been the last few weeks, and warmth appears to be starting to creep back in even though really, it still feels like winter has only just started. 

If there weren’t so much to do it’s exactly the kind of day where I would like to take a long, calm walk through the botanical gardens and enjoy the crisp edge to the air. I don’t go often in winter but that’s part of what makes it noteworthy. 

Would you like to go with me? Perhaps in late spring or summer would work better for us to walk those paths together. There’d be no chill to the air and the sun would reach our bones. Not to mention there’d be damselflies to see and I could ask whether you can tell them apart from dragonflies, or which you prefer. 

We could get coffee first? Or after. Or not at all. It’s unimportant really. What matters is the companionship and sometimes it seems so bizarre that you travel through so very much of my life with me but are so very rarely actually at my side. 

Our paths cross and intersect so often. We smile and laugh or worry. We come and go then come and go, and come and go again; and we know that eventually there’ll be one last ‘go’ and the ‘come’ won’t be there again. Until then, you’re more than welcome to walk beside me, if you’d like. 

So, just let me know - should we get a coffee? I'd like to. But if I ever actually asked, I think you'd question my motives. Maybe one day it'll happen by coincidence and I'll thank Serendipity for her kindness. ",1,1751782307.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I’ve always been the kind of person who thinks a lot about life — who I am, why I exist, and what I should be doing in this beautiful world.
I used to chase money for a while, but I realised that even if I became super rich, it wouldn’t truly make me happy.

What really makes me feel alive is spreading good energy, helping others feel better about themselves and their lives.
I don’t follow any religion, but I love listening to people and supporting them through their struggles and worries.

In my home country, being a social worker is extremely hard and often not treated well, but it seems like the situation is better here in Australia.
I’m really motivated to become a capable and kind social worker, and I’d love to learn from people who are already doing the work here.

I can read about it online, but I really want to meet a real social worker in Perth — someone I can talk to, ask questions, and hear honest stories from.

If you’re open to chatting, I’d honestly be so grateful. I’m happy to shout a coffee or dinner — whatever suits you. I’m 30, but I don’t care about age or background — anyone is welcome. I just want to learn and listen.

Thanks so much for reading. If you’re okay to meet, feel free to comment or DM me 🙏

1lsu3tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1lsu3tj/so_ive_been_wandering_timberwolf_mountain_without/,So. I’ve been wandering Timberwolf Mountain without shoes for 5 days. Here’s the story.,"It may not be as interesting as the headline says, but it made me laugh so I figured I’d tell how I got here. Hope I used the right flair, why isn’t there a “war stories around the fire” flair?

I think I’m on roughly day 200. This is my first game that doesn’t have animals on passive. I’ve played a couple challenges and I’ve played all of Wintermute so I know enough about the animals to know that I hate the jump scares, which is why I had a pilgrim run with severe weather and passive animals. 

I decided to start a new game for the DLC and to do Voyager without making any changes. I thought that I had cougar enacted, but she hasn’t come onto my map yet so I’m guessing there’s a glitch or I didn’t do it like I thought I did. 

I started in mystery Lake because I’m very familiar with it. Around day 40 or so I was jumped by a bear who was in a very odd location. I end up surviving and shooting said bear. I chase him. I should have known from my challenge days that in its final moments, the bear walks like normal, but for whatever reason I was confused and got close to the bear, trying to figure out what was going on, which of course it turned and attacked me before it gave up its ghost. Believe it or not, I survived. And then a snow storm hit, not quite a blizzard, but enough to cause me great concern. I’m running around frantically trying to heal myself and whatever else I was trying to do, thinking that I might just be able to pull it off, my first decent kill of the game, I had practically been starving up to this point. Then boom. A wolf. With my dead bear in eye shot, I fade into the long dark. 

Of course I’m furious. But I decide to cheat death, and find myself in flipping Ash Canyon. Let👏🏻me👏🏻tell👏🏻you. I loath Ash Canyon. I played it with passive animals before, but I hate the terrain, and I know it well enough to know I am not safe. And this was supposed to freakin be the safe option (what a joke). Since I am now more angry than prior to my long dark fading, I decide to ask my husband to play. He’s been casually watching me play for a couple years, so getting to talk him through game mechanics helped lessen my rage. But of course he’s killed by a wolf after an hour, that’s an hour in the game, not an hour in real life lol. 

We cheat death again and end up in Pleasant Valley community center (now THAT’S a safe far away option hinterland! 
*shakes fist vaguely in the direction of Canada*

thankfully, I know this one because of wintermute, so I talk him through scavenging and eventually took over. From here, I decide to move my base to the community center because of the stove and then spend the next 80-100 days exploring, recovering, and bringing everything over from mystery Lake, nearly starving to death several times. I then decide that I’m dumb for picking Pleasant Valley just because of the stove, coastal highway is the place to be, since I spent a lot of time there trying to beat the stupid winter challenge 10 to 15 times. So, I start the process of moving everything to coastal Highway, exploring and looting as I go, now this is where I really get myself set up. I finally get the hang of hunting. Bag a bear, a moose, and crap ton of fish. I have a ton of stuff at my base which I’ve started to decorate, I have Charcoal paths between all of the huts and islands so I can navigate in blizzards and in the middle of my first deal with trader. I am set up, but now I have to decide what to do next. And now that I have the moose satchel, Obviously it’s going for the technical backpack, the only redeeming factor of Ash Canyon (and also the new furniture tools), so that I can be the heavy weight champion (or something like that)

I spent several days planning my trip, trying to make sure that I was as low weight as possible, because I plan to do the rope climbs for the backpack, as I said, I hate Ash Canyon so I’m going for speed. And I’ve done it before, which I barely survived because I wasn’t prepared for it, so I know I should be able to do it again with proper preparation. 

So I’m ready to go, I’ve got decent layerable clothing in case I hit a blizzard, but also clothing that I don’t care about so I can drop weight as needed. I’ve got my bed roll, five coffees and a stim, some coal and cloth with the plan to gather sticks for snow shelters. I have my revolver and some ammo, my knife, hacksaw for the summit, which I was planning on getting after the backpack, and a few miscellaneous other things. 

I arrive in Pleasant Valley with high spirits, while going up the path to the point of disagreement, I see a wolf. No problem, this is why I brought my revolver (also a droppable item as I have two more at my base) so I fire a shot, and this mother trucker does what literally no other wolf has done in this run so far, it continues to charge me. 

Listen, I carelessly waste ammo and fire off my revolver like a freaking drunk cowboy all the time and have never had a wolf NOT run from me. And this trucker was far away when I started firing! I’ve been watching those suckers scatter on the ice and mountain tops for weeks and weeks, but not this homie. Not. This. Homie. I lose quite a bit of ammo trying to kill him and then half of my condition. I recover in a nearby cave and set out again in the morning. 

Boom. The.same.thing.happens. This is why I freaking left Pleasant Valley, what are these wolves on??

I end up frantically running up the path to the bunker, hoping I don’t run into that dang bear while being tracked by another wolf (or the same wolf??) and a single bullet left. A good chunk of my food is gone. I really was planning on just hoofing it from CH to TWM without issue. I know there’s nothing left to scavenge in PV, I also know that TWM Is a gamble on whether there will be readily available food, but going forward sounds a lot better than going all the way back home, especially with that stupid wolf out there, who is apparently afraid of nothing, so I decide to press on and risk it. I DO after all have one more cheat death. 

I have no idea when I realized that the two wolf attacks destroyed my shoes. But apparently two pairs of socks and crampons keep the frost bite at bay. I’ve now been scampering around the mountain, managing to find some ammo and I’m thankful that I brought my fishing gear. Since I’ve done the summit before, I figured I might as well give it another go and hope I can find some shoes up there before I finally head to Ash Canyon. No turning back now. 

Anyone know a good place to find shoes?

We weren’t close back then but after six years, we reconnected because we both live in the same city now. We met up with his group of friends who are genuinely lovely and they even celebrated my birthday with me. We had drinks, stayed over at his place in a group setting and slowly started hanging out more.

Over the next few weeks we’d go out, sometimes just the two of us but mostly with his group. There were sleepovers involved and I’d usually crash on the couch or share a bed with him. It actually made me admire him more because he was always kind, funny and respectful.

One time though, I got super drunk and accidentally puked all over his bed and him. He didn’t make a big deal of it, just cleaned up, made me coffee and was incredibly calm. That moment, weirdly, made me start liking him more.

Then came the night. We were both mostly sober and I ended up sleeping beside him. He put his arm out, I rested on it and then he pulled me closer and kissed my neck. I liked it but I wasn’t sure what to do, so I got up, used the washroom and came back. We cuddled the whole night but when he leaned in for a kiss, I shook my head no. He didn’t push it and we just cuddled till morning.

After that, things kind of went back to normal. No mention of what happened. I still saw him and his friends regularly, still slept next to him a few times but he never made another move. I once rested my hand on him during sleep but he didn’t react or reciprocate.

Eventually he went on a vacation for a few months. We kept in touch via memes and I stayed close with his friends. But ever since that night, I keep replaying everything in my head. I’m honestly starting to feel something deeper, like I have a lowkey crush or more, but I don’t think he feels the same.

He’s not the type who talks about dating or love and I’m scared of bringing this up because I really don’t want to ruin the friendship or make it awkward with the group.

Now that he’s back, we’re hanging out even more — group hikes, dinners, the usual. He still invites me to everything and includes me in plans. But we don’t sleep in the same room anymore and when we meet I get only friend vibes from him.

So I’m torn.
I still feel something for him.
I don’t think he feels anything back.
But I can’t seem to get out of this loop in my head.

How do I emotionally detach and just enjoy the friendship again? Or am I reading this all wrong?",2,1751781569.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm seeking a partner for a long term relationship that hopefully leads to being a life partner. I am a slight introvert that is trying to go out more (by traveling, studying in coffee shops, etc.) and get better at meeting new people. Usually I'm alone in public and I'd love for someone to be there with me. I love the comfortable silences and just enjoying being in someone's company. Almost like experiencing the world without the overabundance of social interaction. Hopefully that makes sense.

I'm a software engineer and a bit of a geek. I love learning new things and meeting new people. I love road trips, museums, hiking, seeing cool things and going to beautiful places. I like learning about different cultures and about the people in them. I like trying new foods and listening to music. I want someone I can do weird things with and make her smile and laugh. I want someone to cuddle and hold. I want her to know I'm all hers and she's all mine (Monogamy only). Also, I like horror and sappy movies so hopefully you'll watch those with me :). Physically, I'm white, 5'9"", and look fairly average looking, but with blue eyes. I do have a Christian background, but have had my own set of issues. Open to kids with the right partner.

INTP Personality type.

What I'm looking for in a partner

* Naturally kind and loyal.
* Has her own set of clearly defined goals regardless of what they might be.
* Healthy mentally/physically and at a place in their life where they have the time to pursue a relationship with me.
* Wants to go on road trips with me.
* Will travel around the world with me.
* Must be clingy and like to spend time around your partner.

Bonuses:

* You will watch horror films and sappy movies with me.
* You will go to the gym with me.
* If your love languages are quality time and physical touch.
* You like anime, k-dramas, tabletop games, or video games.

My biggest con is that I do contract out my services and tend to move between contracts, so would like someone that would be comfortable moving with me on occasion till we find somewhere we'd really like to live.

I had a long call with the resort trying to plan activities for the trip and they kept directing me to the app.  

It's honestly overwhelming.  We've used to having a hotel, maybe an all inclusive, with plenty of access off the property.  By all accounts this place is a near-impossible to navigate maze with a host of byzantine rules, a coffee is $100 and they will take the soul of your first born in order to make a dinner reservation.

I assume it isn't THAT bad, so aside from the near universal ""don't go to the meetings"" advice (hear you loud and clear!) my top concerns are off property access to do tours (the kids are obsessed with sea life) or access groceries.  If so, does it make sense to rent a car at the airport and have your own transportation for the week?  Is that allowed? 

If anyone has pointers or tips for things with the kids that would be great.  They aren't old enough for the kids club unattended; if anyone has had an experience with the babysitters the front desk says they have, that would be great.  I assume standard travel advice applies - bring cash for tips, etc.

Location: Cupang Proper (https://maps.app.goo.gl/pVbxLosQLd762NZD8?g_st=ipc)
What They Offer: Coffee and pastries (for now)
Price Range: ₱110–₱250
Time: 3pm - 11pm
Place: Alfresco - such a vibe! Relaxing din.

What We Ordered: We tried 6 different coffees para madami matikman 😂

Spanish Latte – 7/10 (just the usual, nothing special)
Tiramisu Latte – 7/10 (felt like they forgot the sugar — or maybe wala talaga sugar by default)
Matcha Latte – 5/10 (not a fan of matcha, but my friend na mahilig sa matcha gave it a 6/10, too sweet)
Crème Brûlée – 9/10 (I’d definitely order this again! Personal fave ko na siguro sa kanila)
Butterscotch Sea Foam – 9/10 (really good, but a bit too sweet)
Sea Salt Latte – 4/10 (I asked for it hot. I usually look for sea salt lattes at coffee shops because it’s my personal favorite. But this one was too salty for me 😕 — I couldn’t even finish it. Ended up asking for service water because of the strong aftertaste.)

Overall Rating: 8/10
They offer at least 20 coffee options — kaya madami matry!

This is constructive feedback based on my personal preferences — kanya-kanya pa rin yan. Try it out for yourself! Considering they’ve just started, marami pa maiimprove. 💯",2,1751780842.0,casualbataan,1,1.0,False

This isn’t one of those self-promotion posts, I’m not even going to share my book title or link. I’m genuinely looking for honest, constructive critique to understand what I’m doing right, and more importantly, where I can improve.

I recently rebooted my story and put a lot of effort into tightening the prose, deepening the character work, and sharpening the atmosphere. Chapter 1 has about 97 reads, but only 34 people moved on to Chapter 2, which puts my click-through rate around 35%.

While I know early drop-off isn’t unusual, I’d really like to understand:

What might be pushing readers away?

Does the pacing drag?

Is the hook strong enough?

Does the style flow well or get in the way?

Is there enough emotional or thematic pull?

Does the ending actually work as a cliffhanger?

I've posted the full Chapter 1 below for anyone willing to take a look. I'd deeply appreciate any feedback, whether it’s one sentence or a full breakdown.

No ego here,  I want to grow. And if you’re working on something too, feel free to drop a comment or DM me, I’ll gladly return the favor.

Chapter 1: The Day That Shouldn't Exist.

Life feels like it’s stuck on a loading screen, looping the same empty frames. Everyone else moves forward, smiling, oblivious. I’m the only one who notices the glitch... the static hum beneath it all, the sense that I’m out of sync.

I’ve always heard it, that faint noise no one else seems to catch. It’s been there since I was a kid, growing up in empty mansions while my parents chased their wealth across continents. They left me in a paying guest house, alone, just how I wanted it. No rules, no expectations. Just me and the quiet.

But the quiet lies. It’s not peace. It’s a hollow ache, a reminder that I’m alone even when I choose to be. I’m not shy or broken... I’m just better on my own. Friends, crowds, small talk... they’re noise, not connection. Still, sometimes, late at night, the silence presses too hard, and I wonder what it’s like to be seen.

Tomorrow is June 1. College starts. The thought sits like a stone in my chest. I don’t belong there, surrounded by chatter and pointless ambition. My parents’ money means I don’t need a degree, but they insist it’s “structure.” I’d rather stay invisible, lost in the only thing that’s ever felt right.

Crime.

Not breaking laws... breaking cases. I’m no detective, but I’m better than most. Online, in the shadows of amateur sleuth forums, I’m a ghost among ghosts, ranked in the top ten under a username no one can trace. I’ve spent years dissecting cold cases, piecing together forgotten police reports, chasing truths buried in redacted files. It’s not a hobby. It’s who I am.

I’ve tried other things. I wanted to be more than a loner hunched over a keyboard. I picked up a guitar, learned a few chords, but my fingers stumbled, and the music never sang. I gamed for hours, chasing virtual victories, but the thrill faded fast... empty pixels, no stakes. I even tried boxing, thinking the sweat and bruises might ground me. I was decent, kept myself lean and sharp, but the ring felt like another cage. Nothing stuck. Nothing mattered like crime.

The puzzles pull me back every time. A missing person’s last steps. A killer’s taunting note. A pattern no one else sees. When I solve a case, the world makes sense for a moment. The static quiets. I’m not just a shadow... I’m alive.

This summer, I went too far.

I hacked into the FBI database.

Stupid? Yes. Dangerous? Absolutely. But the rush of breaching something forbidden, of touching secrets no one else could reach... it was electric. It took months of planning, four failed attempts, each one a lesson in what not to do. I didn’t barge in. I slipped through a forgotten backdoor... a neglected subdomain, running outdated software, barely monitored. A quick scan with Shodan confirmed it was vulnerable. A carefully crafted exploit, a stolen contractor’s credentials, and I was in.

The FBI’s internal database. Case files, names, operations... some cold, some active, all buried under layers of encryption. I should’ve logged out, erased my tracks. But I didn’t. I dug deeper, chasing threads that led to places I wasn’t meant to see.

For two months, I locked myself away, unraveling mysteries the world had forgotten. My room became a fortress of code and coffee, the outside world reduced to notifications on my phone. College kids partied, planned, dreamed. I didn’t. I had my puzzles. They were enough.

But tomorrow, college would drag me back. Lectures, deadlines, noise. I’d have to pretend to care about grades, about fitting in, about a future I didn’t want. My parents could buy me a degree, but they couldn’t buy me purpose.

DATE: 31, May.

With that, I close my diary.
Lying in the dark, staring at the ceiling, I whispered words I didn’t mean. Not a wish, not a prayer... just a tired exhale. A sentence meant for no one. A softness that vanished before it reached the air.
And yet, somehow, it felt like the end of something. Or maybe the beginning.
Hard to tell in the dark.

“I wish tomorrow never came.”

The words slip out, weightless, meant for no one.

...

I lay in bed, eyes heavy, dragged down by the weight of thoughts I couldn't escape.
My body sinks into the mattress... deeper than it ever should... like the bed is swallowing me whole. The bed had never welcomed me like this...
like it was waiting to take me. And I didn’t like it.

I try to move, force my eyes open...
Nothing. My limbs are stone. My vision, gone.

What... what is happening?

I try to speak. My lips part, my tongue moves...
But silence.
Not even a breath.

No... no...

Panic surges. I gather everything I have and rip my eyes open...

Darkness.
Absolute.
Suffocating.
The world is gone...no room, no bed, no body. Just a void, thick and endless, devouring even thought.

Is this a dream? A nightmare?
For a breathless second, there's peace in the nothing.
But then...

A sound.
Wet. Slithering.
Faint, but coming closer.

I freeze. Heart hammering. Straining to hear.
It winds through the dark, followed by a sharp, deliberate...
Click... click... CLICK.
Like teeth snapping shut.

Something moves.

I try to scream, to run, to fight...
But my body betrays me.
Frozen. Locked. Helpless.

The slithering quickens.
It circles me, unseen but certain.
Then...
A jagged whisper cuts through the dark.
Not human. Not even animal.

""Found you.""

My blood turns to ice.
I thrash... inside my mind, inside the nothing... but nothing moves.
The sound grows louder: wet, scraping, alive.

And then...
Touch.
Cold and slick brushes my ankle.
Not a hand.
Something else. Something wrong.

It tightens.
And with a violent yank...
I'm dragged down.

Pain explodes. My body rips, not apart but away...
from everything. From being.
Red flares behind my eyes.

I open my mouth to scream...
But there's still no sound.
Only...

Shattering.

...

I bolt upright, gasping, air clawing into my lungs. My heart pounds, uneven, frantic. My skin clammy, my body aches like I’d been crushed and rebuilt.

A dream. Just a nightmare.

Morning light seeped through the curtains. My phone buzzed, ordinary, insistent. For a moment, I thought it was over. Then I saw the date.

May 32, 7:00 AM.

I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. The screen doesn't change. A glitch? A prank? My stomach twisted. I checked my laptop, my wall calendar, my alarm clock. All said the same thing.

May 32.

I turned on the TV, hands trembling. The news anchor’s voice was cheerful, oblivious.

“Good morning! Today is May 32nd, and we’ve got breaking news…”

The remote slips from my fingers, clattering to the floor. My breath stopped.

This wasn’t a mistake. This was impossible.

I grabbed my phone, scrolling through social media, news sites, forums. Nothing. No one mentioned the date. No one questioned it. The world kept moving, blind to the fracture.

The loneliness hit harder than ever. Was I the only one who saw this?

I turned to my laptop, desperate to restart it, to wake up from whatever this was. The screen flickered, static crawling across it like a living thing.

And then, for a split second, I saw it.

A reflection. Not mine.

Something... someone... standing behind me.

I spun around, heart in my throat. Nothing. Just my empty room.

Slowly, I faced the screen again. New words had appeared, stark against the static.

""YOU WISHED FOR THIS.""

My breath hitched. My fingers turned cold.

No.

No, no, no...

I slammed the laptop shut. My pulse thundered, drowning out thought.

Had I done this?

Had my careless wish… broken the world?

Then pain... sudden and savage... tore across my hand.

Like something unseen had sliced me open.

I looked down.

Something was carving into my skin...

letter by letter, slow and deliberate.

Y

A sharp sting flared.

U

The pain rippled through my nerves like lightning.

I screamed. Twisted.

But whatever force held the blade... didn't stop.

N

A

Each stroke etched deeper than the last,

as if the name itself was burning its way into me.

By the time it was done, my hand was slick with blood.

The letters pulsed... raw, alien.

Yuna.

A name I didn’t recognize.

A name I felt in my bones.

What is this? What is happening to me?

But the world twisted... folding in on itself like a broken reel of film.

And in that collapse, something in me snapped loose..

Whatever was left of me clawed its way out of the dark

only to find something crueler waiting.

I jolted awake, tearing loose from the spiral of nightmares,

actually believing I was free.

But the world didn’t let go.

It sank its claws in deeper.

And that’s when I knew...

It was intended to be installed on handle bars. However, I found that the TST frame slider provides a perfect mounting point. The rod is ~20mm in diameter, slightly thinner than a regular 22 mm handle bar. So I printed an insert with TPU. 

The rest was printed with PETG, as suggested by the original model maker. Seems solid and balancing as expected. Will update later for longevity.

To put this in context, i entered university in march 2025, in the first day i meet this group of girls, one of them (the one who talked to me in the first place) was the funniest one, we have a lot in common and pursue the same goals on our career and have the same beliefs and ethics (we study social work, and it's not that common to find someone like that), the first week i thought she was so funny and pretty attractive, but then she told me she was in a long distance relationship with another girl, everyday i have to hear about how cool her girlfriend is, she is really in love with her, and i can't blame her. Our friends were kinda invalidating her relationship, one of our friends kept flirting with her ""as a joke"" and she started to feel bad about it, so i had to cheer her up, even if it kinda hurted me. I started seeing other people to forget about it, went to the club and even fucked with a random guy i meet, but the feeling never disappeared. We kept getting closer, i would buy her food and she would buy me coffee after our long study sessions, we didn't even think about calling our group to study, we worked well together. This week our uni was closed and we didn't have any place to study so she suggested her house, i went yesterday for what i expected was a couple hours, but i ended sleeping over. Her mom loved me, she kept offering me food, her mom and dad said she talks about me with them, i just laughed and she was kinda nervous, she is pretty relaxed and talkative in uni but now she seemed shy. Her parents are religious, so i suspect that seeing her bisexual daughter with a boy was hopeful for them, idk. She shares a room with her sister, and everytime she wanted to go in, she knocked the door, it was kinda funny but akward since we both knew what they were thinking. 
I know is weird, but i really wanted to sleep in the same bed with her, but obviously she slept in the same bed with her sister (we are both 18 and she is 16), we still kept talking and joking, then in a moment when we were joking about the music, she went and got on top of me to grab my phone, i froze in place and said ""get tf off"" laughing, her sister, half asleep, asked her ""what the f are you doing?"" we both laughed and she went back to bed. I couldn't sleep well, today morning she took me to the bus stop in a awkward silence and then i went home. I can't stop thinking about it, and now i really feel bad because she is in love with someone else, and im absolutely not her type or anything, it's absolutely impossible to have something, i just want the feelings to go, and i don't want to ruin our friendship.

I don't want to make any assumptions.  I don't want to assume you never loved me or that I'm long forgotten.  It's easy to assume that, though.  Since you never responded to my messages and so much time has passed.  It seems pretty clear that I won't ever hear from you again.

I had another episode today, like I did that 4th of July.  I came so close to passing out again and it was really upsetting.  The way you took care of me and made me feel safe was so genuine and so foreign.  My mom was in town for this episode.  She pretty much ignored me and was more concerned about making coffee for my stepdad.  I felt so alone and sad.

Just a small glimpse of how I ended up hyperindependent.  Getting myself to safety, making sure I get the room temp down and getting my cooling towel ready.  All while on the verge of passing out.

I missed your calm concern and reassurance.  I miss feeling safe.  I miss feeling loved.  I miss you.

I hope you have some good memories.  I hope I left you with moments of feeling deeply loved and cared for, because you were.  And are.  And I hope, one day, you let someone in so you don't have to do it all alone.  I know how hard it is.

I can't tell if Eyekons are racists, xenophobic, ethnocentric, cultural chauvinists, orientalists, cultural imperialists, nationalists, performative activists, selective moralists, hypocrites, young & dumb or simply all of the above.

The way they put down kpop, koreans & kpop idols as a whole is exhausting and I'm not even Korean or a big fan of kpop anymore but let me unpack my reasons;


- (1)  EATING 🐄🍪 GNARLY 🤖

Why do Eyekons sound like incels praising thin attractive women for eating large greasy McDonald burgers? 
""Oh I love women who eat 🧔🏻😏😍..."" please stop🤣
As human beings do y'all realize how strict of a diet they have to follow to have a perfectly flat stomach & tone body all the time. Hell forbid they gain weight in other body parts except their hips & butt, they gonna switch up so fast. 
Maybe if koreans & Internationals fans didn't bodyshame & unstan idols when they gain a little weight, companies would let them eat healthier. Oh wait many idols are doing mukbangs but they get called pick mes & pigs 🥺 play dice & pick a side please. 


- (2) MATURITY & CUNTINESS? 💃🤸 GNARLY 👺

The kpop knowledge of eyekons is Pinterest level deep tsh tsh. Even tiktok can teach them more than that. Go back 1 or 2 generations in kpop, as a matter of fact go back to the beginning, women in kpop were serving ""cunt"" & mature concepts to the point of national outrage & lifelong trauma.


- (3) WOKE 🧌 GNARLY 👽

The type of fans that will follow the blm protest crowd but aren't even near the crowd for non popular issues. The 'fake progressive woke' fan is who Katseye are attracting. A fanbase like that doesn't age well when you're trying to become a global sensation. They'll become more needy, controlling and demanding. I always laugh when I see Katseye cringe at scripts, like babygirls these are for your own good. 
You're literally 1 McDonald's, 1 Starbucks coffee, 1 chatgpt request away from 'Boycott & Cancel' & 'Mad over nothing, angry over everything' gang. 
These are the types of fans that will cancel the girls after 1 slip up but will order boxes of shein from slave workers & the latest product made by poor child workers, while their close ones are doing the same cancellable stuff in the same house 2 rooms away.


- (4) SUPERIORITY COMPLEX OF THE WEST!😈 GNARLY 🙊

Did International kpop fans forget how US media  treated Amy Winehouse, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Normani from FH & the list goes on & on. Isn't the west supposed to be so much better without those restrictions from Korea, but it's still as bad 🤖. Till this day they're still clowning, mocking & not forgiving Lil mama for getting on stage during Jay-Z & Alicia Keys's performance.
While actual criminals & immoral celebs are roaming free, getting millions of streams & dollars, getting praised & defended by their loyal fans... sounds familar? It's the same as some males in the squid game cast, lee sooman & so many others.


- (5) BETTER THAN KPOP👯‍♀️ GNARLY 👺

Eyekons have an identity crisis every 3 days. Are they pop? Kpop? Global? No matter the industry, the glazing is too much for a girl group with about 10 generic songs.
Katseye's competition as a global group is xg & vcha. They only mock vcha each time cause they have nothing other xg, apart from KS charming visuals. KS Daniella's gnarly fancam is the only thing that would put xg to shame so far.

KS competition as Kpop is groups like nmixx or babymonster. Watching their live performances i don't understand how Katseye is outselling when they are all on the same level or I personally think nmixx are a little more talented. 

KS as a pop group have flo as competition, who they definitely surpass except music wise but Americans will compare them to the ogs. PCD  & Destiny’s child have already set the bar high as performers. Fifth harmony & especially Little Mix have distinct powerful vocals each. Without watching the mvs, KS sound like 1 voice. So y'all think Americans won't try to make Manon the next beyonce 🤣 & leave the group especially since it won't make a difference music wise. Americans thrive off pitting women against each other & putting them on a pedestal just to kick them down. They'll have a field day with chronically online girls who play the woke agenda. 


- (6) JEALOUS OF YOONCHAE 😾 GNARLY 🙊

""Kpop idols must be so jealous of yoonchae"" or ""Glad we didn't lose yoonchae to kpop"" smh.
Jealous of her beauty perhaps, yeah the view is frickin gnarly so it's understandle. Apart from that 
still when there's nothing unique or revolutionary about what she's doing.
The average kpop idol nowadays is an all rounder. 
Again, these fans' kpop knowledge is Pinterest level deep. There are dozens of ""Female idols being baddies"" compilations that would make yoonchae look like the introvert of the room. 
Korean shows, before bts made kpop global, literally shipped kpop idols & made them go on dates on TV. Kpop idols used to do sexy dances or kiss in awards shows.
Did the evil koreans get mad at this?? Everyone thought it was iconic, only the idols that did extra fanservice & fostered parasocial relationships get backlash. Also let's not act like there aren't any Americans, Europeans or Brazilians getting mad that a female idol glanced at their oppa's beauty. 

Eyekons act like yoonchae was finally able to get the license to her 1st gun after being rescued by her katseye fairy godmothers. 🔫 Please tone it down & let the girl breathe normally. 


THESE ARE ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW. KATSEYE SHOW LOVE TO KOREA & KPOP BUT THEIR FANS ARE SO DIFFERENT.

1lstnon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AEWOfficial/comments/1lstnon/quirks_of_early_aew/,Quirks of Early AEW,"So far, all I’ve re-watched is the pre-show to the first Double or Nothing, and there’s already so many little things I forgot or I found interesting.

Like I remember those first shows before Dynamite started being built through YouTube. A little from BTE, but mostly from “Road to” videos. But I strangely couldn’t find them on AEW’s YouTube channel. I just found them, and they’re on the Nightmare Family YouTube channel. So that’s a bit awkward, since that channel seems to be owned and run by Cody and Brandi.

Another thing, I forgot that AEW treated Brandi as much as a founder as the others. Like between the pre-show and main show, they did a video segment of Cody, Brandi, Matt, Nick, and Kenny arriving at the arena (with a few BTE nods like Cody having an FTR coffee cup) and then those 5 came out to hype up the crowd and all got mic time.

It’s just so weird in general seeing how much All Elite Wrestling was built around those 5 and how much BTE tie in there was. I had forgotten just how huge BTE was back then, and how highly attended those first shows were. It’s just kinda surreal seeing Cody and the “rah rah, this is a revolution” EVP when now he’s the big babyface in WWE and calls AEW “the other place.”

A few other weird things. I forgot Alicia Atout worked DoN 2019. Also, now at AEW they pronounce her last name differently than they did then.

As much as people complain about AEW missing camera shots, oh my goodness, they’ve come a long way.

Funny seeing the dual Librarian gimmick. It was before it’s time since TNT has that Librarians tv show they’re always promoting during AEW these days.

Seems like Kip Sabian was going to be positioned like one of the pillars, and beat Sammy clean on the pre-show.

AEW obviously already knew they had something in MJF.

There was a much louder talk about DEI back then, even though there’s probably more overall diversity and inclusion now compared to then. That’s actually just a big culture change from 2019 to 2025. ",2,1751780054.0,AEWOfficial,1,1.0,False

1lstkma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1lstkma/destiny/,Destiny,"I still believe in destiny, twin flames, soul ties—

I still believe in my person—my forever—who’s yet to show up.

I’m still open to feeling all the rawness and depth that emotions bring.

And I hope I’m not too late to start seeking it.

Do I believe in destiny? In fate?

What are the odds that I’ll meet my person—

someone who won’t be fleeting?

I know one thing for certain:

I won’t settle for anything less.

And I won’t lower my standards.

I still wonder—

what will my forever look like?

Who is the one I’m destined to be with?

I wonder what your touch, your warmth, your presence will feel like beside me.

I still believe in destiny.


I wonder what it would feel like to finally let go of these overwhelming thoughts,

to breathe freely—for once—and just feel relief.

I wonder what it will be like to fall in love with you—

a deep, deep karmic love.

I’m just curious to know—

would you dive to any depth just to honor my energy,

my feelings, my essence?

I wonder what it will feel like to be in your arms,

just listening to your heartbeat.

I wonder what it would feel like for your strong
 
arms to wrap around me in the morning—

before I slowly stir my sleepy eyes—

and you pull me closer into your chest.

I wonder what it would feel like to hear your raspy, sleepy voice

as you whisper, “Good morning.”

I’m sure your heartbeat would be music to my ears—

grounding me, calming my racing mind,

pulling me out of my spirals and back into stillness.

I wonder what it would be like to follow a morning routine with you—

those quiet mornings, barefoot in the kitchen,

brewing two cups of coffee, utensils softly —

clinking, breakfast being made.

I wonder what it would feel like to sit on your lap,

enjoying the silence while sipping coffee,

resting in the stillness.

I wonder what it would be like to run errands with you—

your strong arm wrapped around my shoulder.

Better yet, guiding me gently through a crowd,

your hand resting on the small of my back.

I wonder what it would be like to share a slow dance in the evening—

a glass of wine in one hand, my other arm wrapped around your neck.

I wonder what it would feel like to end the day wrapped in your arms—

cuddling on a giant armchair,

falling asleep to the rhythm of your heartbeat.

Just know—

I pray for you to find me.

Or perhaps, for me to find you.

And the rest will become ancient history.

A history of love.

Of passion.

Of devotion.

Of worship.

Of home.

Right now, I’m still aching—

still believing that I’ll find you.

A man of mystery.



Forever and ever,

Yours.

1lstkbm,https://i.redd.it/ivycyu8fw6bf1.png,The Golden Zippo,"I've always been a fighter. I was born too early and had to fight just to survive. Then life said that was an easy fight. My mother gave birth to twins two years later. On my tenth birthday, I had to fight my uncle for stealing our rent money. At thirteen, my mother had a mental breakdown, and now I'm a child raising two preteens and taking care of an adult.
I never had what people call a childhood. No, my upbringing was more aligned with a battleground. When we didn’t have much food in the fridge or cabinets, I’d go out and steal what we needed. My mom knew, and yet she didn’t care.
“So long as the kids have food,” she would say with chip crumbs on her chest.

To say I hate my mother would be an understatement. There was a defining moment in high school. I got caught stealing a lighter with a Grim Reaper printed on it. I started stealing out of boredom more than survival. Around the same time, my mother’s mental health was declining faster every day. When my mom arrived at the police station, I knew it from what the uniforms were saying:
“Nah man, cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and goddamned Daisy Dukes.”

When the uniforms left, I just tilted my head back and sighed. Not from frustration or relief. No, it was still from boredom. That’s when I met him for the first time.

In the corner of the small room stood a man that wasn’t there before. He had a grin on his face like he was watching a movie for the seventh time and his favorite scene was about to come on. He was opening and closing a golden zipper lighter. When he finally snapped it shut one last time, I saw a stylized, scripted letter “D” on it.

“You look bored,” said the Zippo man.

I just stared at him. I could feel my face settling into cold indifference — the face I would wear whenever I thought I was looking at someone with authority.

His grin turned into a smirk when I didn’t reply. The next two words he whispered gave me nightmares. His eyes flashed golden and his lips barely moved when he said,
“Watch this.”

He snapped his fingers and vanished. Then my mom walked through the door and told me the police were using witchcraft and we needed to leave. Her delusions had now evolved to include witchcraft. I just shook my head and walked out with her.

When the cops returned the stuff from my pockets, they also gave me a golden Zippo I didn’t have before. When I tried giving it back, the cop insisted I keep it.

That was 20 years ago. My mom’s long gone. My siblings live out of state. As for me, I’m finally settling some old scores in a way that only a kid who’s had to fight his whole life can. I don’t need witchcraft, I don’t need demons, and I don’t need pride.

You see, the spirits of the desert didn’t like that they lost their Desert Son and the secrets I took with me. I’m no longer a child wearing indifference like sunglasses. I have a purpose now, and I sure as hell ain’t bored anymore.

I destroyed the lighter last night. I accepted I deserve hell. I’ve led so many people down the path of darkness without even realizing it. I didn’t know people were watching and being influenced. Others wearing indifference like it was in style.  

What I also know is I can’t save myself from my fate. That’s just facts. You see, now something else is living in me. It’s burning inside, and it’s helping me finally make a difference in this fight. Death has no power over me now. I’m not fighting for victory anymore. I’m fighting from victory. I’ve got a new name, and it’s written in a book I never knew existed.

“Are you ready to finish my story, old man?” I say to a man sitting at the café’s small table, overlooking his tea.

“Not bored anymore?” he says with a Cajun accent.

I look at him with amusement painted on my face. I can feel my expression shift as I look into his eyes. My eyes start to turn to steel, my lips fall to a neutral placement, my shoulders relax. I leave the café without my coffee.

He’s baiting me, I think to myself. If I fight him now, everything I’m doing will be lost.

Funny — I have things to lose now. I’ve got an entire police force to look into before anything. There are also others who need to hear the Truth.

They deserve to be given a choice. Even if they make the wrong one, they need to know choices exist. 
If you see this man with his zippo, just know he’s a liar. He only offers pain and suffering wrapped in golden lies.

### **Title:** *Levy Rozman: The Time Gambit*

**Genre:** Sci-Fi, Comedy, Chess Fiction
**Setting:** 2025 Brooklyn (origin), 1886 London (destination)

---

## **ACT I – THE FINAL MOVE**

**INT. GOTHAMCHESS STUDIO – NIGHT (2025)**

*Levy sits in a high-tech studio, surrounded by multiple screens. One shows a headline:*

> “Levy Rozman Loses GM Norm Again – AI Bot Wins Rapid Event”

*He’s sipping cold coffee. Twitch chat scrolls by, but slower now. Less hype. More noise.*

**LEVY (muttering to himself)**
I’ve taught millions how to play. I’ve broken down Magnus, Hikaru, even beaten some strong GMs...
But history still won’t put me on the wall.

*He turns to a chess board on the side table. He plays 1.e4… then pauses.*

**LEVY**
Imagine if I just... *invented* the Caro-Kann myself. Made it mine. Rewrote the timeline.
AlphaZero can’t take that from me.

*A mechanical *click*. One of his vintage chess bookshelves swings open, revealing a brass-plated **Time Machine** — steampunk, yet oddly pristine. A sticky note:*

> “*You’ve tried everything in 2025. Try 1886. –Future You*”

**LEVY (to himself)**
Okay... Sure. Why not. If you can’t beat the system... go back and design it.

*He grabs a hoodie, a Reuben sandwich, and a pocket chess set. Hits the lever.*

**FLASH.**

---

## **ACT II – THE AGE OF BRILLIANCE**

**EXT. LONDON – LATE AUTUMN, 1886**

*Horse-drawn carriages. Fog. Top hats. A grungy Victorian chess café.*

Levy walks in, adjusting to the era. He hears men discuss the “Royal Game” and notices one thing: *Everyone’s playing the King's Gambit or e4 e5 lines.*

**LEVY (to himself)**
No c6 in sight. No Karpov. No Petrosian.
This... this is virgin territory.

---

### **MONTAGE – THE KARRO CANNON RISES**

* Levy begins playing locals with 1.e4 c6 and calmly dismantles them.
* He writes under the pseudonym **L. Karro**, claiming the line as his own.
* He hosts lectures at salons: *“Controlling the Center Without Dying Instantly.”*
* He crafts the **Advanced Variation**, disguised as “The Iron Path.”
* He becomes a minor London celebrity: “The Prophet of Positional Chess.”

---

## **ACT III – EXISTENTIAL CHECK**

**INT. 1886 INN – LATE NIGHT**

*Levy journals by candlelight. He looks out the window at the gaslit city.*

**LEVY (voiceover)**
I did it. I changed the narrative. I invented the Caro-Kann.
But it still doesn’t feel like enough.

*He sees a spectral figure in the mirror — himself, in modern clothes — playing against Stockfish 18.*

**GHOSTLY VOICE (his own)**
Views fade. Elo fades. Even ideas... get crushed by engines.

**LEVY**
But legacy... legacy plays long games.

---

## **ACT IV – THE FINAL MATCH**

**INT. THE GREAT CHESS EXHIBITION, 1886**

*Levy challenges **Wilhelm Steinitz**, the World Champion, who chuckles at this “Karro” fellow’s theories.*

**STEINITZ**
You play like someone who sees the future.
**LEVY**
I play like someone who’s been crushed by it.

*They begin: 1.e4 c6.*

*Gasps echo. The Caro-Kann is born on this board.*

*The match rages. Levy plays with purpose—calm defense, surgical counterplay. The crowd is spellbound. He wins.*

---

## **EPILOGUE – THE LEGEND RETURNS**

**INT. GOTHAMCHESS STUDIO – MORNING (2025)**

*Levy wakes up, head on his desk. Steam rises from a fresh coffee. The screen reads:*

> **Levy Rozman – FIDE GM Title Confirmed**
> *“Historic Contributions Recognized: Inventor of Caro-Kann”*

*Twitch explodes.*

**CHAT:**

* “BRO INVENTED A WHOLE DEFENSE??”
* “History buff arc goes HARD”
* “c6 GOAT”

**LEVY (smirking to camera)**
Turns out the best way to get a GM norm...
is to write your own opening.

**FADE OUT.**

While we originally only intended on a temporary stay, things have mostly been really cool, so we just been taking it month by month.

This past couple of weeks, my roommates have both been working A LOT. Eight and nine days in a row, both of them. I haven't been working as much, so I have been doing the bulk of the cleaning, just because I can and am in general more tidy than they are. In particular I cleaned up their tea mugs and dessert plates for literally 5 nights in a row. I didn't mind! They had a lot going on.

However, a couple nights ago, I made myself a quick snack (requiring a small cutting board, one small plate, and a butter knife). I left it in the sink around 9pm and called my boyfriend. They were sitting down to their own dinner. At 11pm I came out, and they had cleaned the ENTIRE kitchen, sans my dishes. I have been cleaning up for them for a week but they could not also put my singular dish in the dishwasher? I could totally understand not wanting to hand wash a wooden cutting board. But the dish and knife?! When we have a dishwasher that works and was empty because I had emptied it earlier in the day?!!!

I immediately washed my dishes and then asked if I was overstepping by cleaning after them in the first place and if we should all just wash our own dishes. They said no, that they appreciate me, and will help to keep it even.

Previously we had issues with my male roommate opening my packages, and THE VERY NEXT DAY, he texted me to say that he is sorry but he opened my package again.

So I just came back from visiting North Carolina. I visited a good amount of the filming locations and have a couple of thoughts. 

First off, I am Asian American and although I was nervous and prepared to probably experience some racism since it’s the south, I did experience more than I had anticipated. And I’m born and raised in the states and have always been in a predominantly white neighborhood so it’s not exactly “out of place” for me (although of course it can happen anywhere) However NC was the first time I felt really out of place honestly. I loved visiting the locations but the amount of micro aggressions and racism I experienced was not great, so something to note if you are also a POC planning to go. 

The locations I’d been to were all pretty close to each other, like 10-30 minutes within that. The summer house was far from Wilmington though. 

The country club… have to be very careful here. It’s private property and I wasn’t really aware of that, didn’t see signs and I’ve seen plenty of tiktoks of girls my age going and taking pics. Got in trouble quickly, but the security was SUPER understanding and sweet. Let me take my photos / videos but it might not always be the case. 

Motel had many homeless people, parents didn’t want me getting out of the car to go up close. So I guess I’d say to just use your judgement on if you think it’s safe or not to get out. 

I couldn’t find too much merch for the show, and whale of a tale (Papercut books) was completely sold out of all TSITP books. 

Make sure to go to maroon monkey cafe to get a coffee inspired by the show!!

1lstfb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tsitp/comments/1lstfb3/visited_the_filming_locations_for_the_show_in/,Visited the filming locations for the show in person,"So I just came back from visiting North Carolina. I visited a good amount of the filming locations and have a couple of thoughts. 

First off, I am Asian American and although I was nervous and prepared to probably experience some racism since it’s the south, I did experience more than I had anticipated. And I’m born and raised in the states and have always been in a predominantly white neighborhood so it’s not exactly “out of place” for me (although of course it can happen anywhere) However NC was the first time I felt really out of place honestly. I loved visiting the locations but the amount of micro aggressions and racism I experienced was not great, so something to note if you are also a POC planning to go. 

The locations I’d been to were all pretty close to each other, like 10-30 minutes within that. The summer house was far from Wilmington though. 

The country club… have to be very careful here. It’s private property and I wasn’t really aware of that, didn’t see signs and I’ve seen plenty of tiktoks of girls my age going and taking pics. Got in trouble quickly, but the security was SUPER understanding and sweet. Let me take my photos / videos but it might not always be the case. 

Motel had many homeless people, parents didn’t want me getting out of the car to go up close. So I guess I’d say to just use your judgement on if you think it’s safe or not to get out. 

I couldn’t find too much merch for the show, and whale of a tale (Papercut books) was completely sold out of all TSITP books. 

Make sure to go to maroon monkey cafe to get a coffee inspired by the show!! ",1,1751779192.0,tsitp,0,1.0,False
1lstd5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lstd5h/23m38f_went_on_a_date_with_an_older_woman_i_met/,"(23M/38F) Went on a date with an older woman I met at a networking event, unsure how it went","Hi everyone,

I (23M) finally went on that coffee date with the woman (38F) I met at a networking event a little over a month ago! We met up earlier today. I greeted her with a hug and asked how she was doing. The conversation started a little slow but gradually became more relaxed and natural. We ended up talking for about an hour and a half. She seemed engaged, kept good eye contact, played with her hair a bit, and was present the whole time.

It didn’t feel like a mentorship vibe like some predicted, she didn’t ask about my career or give any advice. I asked her questions, and she seemed happy to share.

At the end, I picked up the tab and she thanked me warmly without insisting on splitting. As we left, I offered to walk her home, but she declined, saying it was in the opposite direction of the subway for me. I offered again just in case, but she politely insisted, so I backed off. We hugged goodbye, and that was that.

Now, I’m honestly unsure how to read the date. She didn’t overtly flirt, and we didn’t make plans to meet again. That said, the vibe was pleasant, and I’m planning to text her tomorrow to say I enjoyed the time and suggest doing something next weekend.

A couple of questions:
	1.	Based on how the date went, does it sound like she’s interested?
	2.	Any ideas for a second outing that’s casual and low-pressure but still feels like a date?
	3.	What’s a good way to phrase a text that suggests hanging out again without coming on too strong?

Additional context:
We didn’t meet sooner because she was traveling internationally for work for 3 weeks. Before she left, I told her I’d really like to get to know her better and invited her for coffee. She actually offered to meet the next day (I wasn’t available). While she was away, we messaged every few days and she shared updates about her trip.

For what it’s worth, I’m not looking for anything serious because of the age gap, but if things do progress, I plan to be honest and upfront about that.

Appreciate any insight or advice, thanks in advance!",1,1751778972.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1lstcfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lstcfv/remnants_from_when_my_anxiety_was_overboard/,Remnants from when my anxiety was overboard??,"Hi everyone! I’m new here in Reddit and I’m glad that a community exists where I can ask you about things you may have experienced with anxiety.

So, my nervous system got irregular back in 2022, the big one happened at a restaurant, I had no idea what was happening and of course, that developed agoraphobia for a while and each time I would be out alone or with friends at a new place, I would feel very uncomfortable.

Fast forward now, I don’t live with the uncomfortable feelings 24/7 and they don’t pop up as often or strong like they used to. However, yesterday my boyfriend and I visited a coffee place where we met, back in 2023, that day I was anxious and all uncomfortable. Yesterday I was all fine, but I was feeling slightly uncomfortable as my head was achy and I felt like the food wanted to come out.

I would freak out some time ago, but now I think that it’s my body picking up that old register of that place from when I felt uncomfortable and my brain is trying to take me to “safety” by making me feel like that.

And well, here comes the question, would you advice me to “confront” those places by dedicating some exposure?? There’s one I still feel at times anxious even tho I go there each few months, with my stylist, but minty halls help me when I’m sitting there through the hair cut.",1,1751778898.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Very new to the shakeverse, so had a few doubts. 

I was simply going to setup auto buys of $1 once a week to remain active status.  But turns out you alao have to use the card once a week and not miss shaking daily lol. 

I then read in some comments that I could simply turn on Round up on my card and that will fix the requirement to remain active? Is thia true?

I was under the impression that the minimum BTC purchase to count towards Active status was at least $1?
Eg. If I buy a coffee with the card with round up turned on for $1.60 which will round up to $2 I guess. But will that $0.40 cents of BTC round up quality still for active status? Shouldn't that be $1 min?
Also what if I buy like something as low as $0.30 lol as there is no minimum for buy amount on the card.


Also are there inactive status users who still do the daily share to receive the 21 stats stacked daily? Is it still worth it?

Also would love any suggestions or tips on using shakepay. 

Thank you.",2,1751778858.0,shakepay,9,1.0,False
1lstbb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lstbb6/i_just_destroyed_the_golden_zippo/,I just destroyed the Golden Zippo,"I've always been a fighter. I was born too early and had to fight just to survive. Then life said that was an easy fight. My mother gave birth to twins two years later. On my tenth birthday, I had to fight my uncle for stealing our rent money. At thirteen, my mother had a mental breakdown, and now I'm a child raising two preteens and taking care of an adult.
I never had what people call a childhood. No, my upbringing was more aligned with a battleground. When we didn’t have much food in the fridge or cabinets, I’d go out and steal what we needed. My mom knew, and yet she didn’t care.
“So long as the kids have food,” she would say with chip crumbs on her chest.

To say I hate my mother would be an understatement. There was a defining moment in high school. I got caught stealing a lighter with a Grim Reaper printed on it. I started stealing out of boredom more than survival. Around the same time, my mother’s mental health was declining faster every day. When my mom arrived at the police station, I knew it from what the uniforms were saying:
“Nah man, cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and goddamned Daisy Dukes.”

When the uniforms left, I just tilted my head back and sighed. Not from frustration or relief. No, it was still from boredom. That’s when I met him for the first time.

In the corner of the small room stood a man that wasn’t there before. He had a grin on his face like he was watching a movie for the seventh time and his favorite scene was about to come on. He was opening and closing a golden zipper lighter. When he finally snapped it shut one last time, I saw a stylized, scripted letter “D” on it.

“You look bored,” said the Zippo man.

I just stared at him. I could feel my face settling into cold indifference — the face I would wear whenever I thought I was looking at someone with authority.

His grin turned into a smirk when I didn’t reply. The next two words he whispered gave me nightmares. His eyes flashed golden and his lips barely moved when he said,
“Watch this.”

He snapped his fingers and vanished. Then my mom walked through the door and told me the police were using witchcraft and we needed to leave. Her delusions had now evolved to include witchcraft. I just shook my head and walked out with her.

When the cops returned the stuff from my pockets, they also gave me a golden Zippo I didn’t have before. When I tried giving it back, the cop insisted I keep it.

That was 20 years ago. My mom’s long gone. My siblings live out of state. As for me, I’m finally settling some old scores in a way that only a kid who’s had to fight his whole life can. I don’t need witchcraft, I don’t need demons, and I don’t need pride.

You see, the spirits of the desert didn’t like that they lost their Desert Son and the secrets I took with me. I’m no longer a child wearing indifference like sunglasses. I have a purpose now, and I sure as hell ain’t bored anymore.

I destroyed the lighter last night. I accepted I deserve hell. I’ve led so many people down the path of darkness without even realizing it. I didn’t know people were watching and being influenced. Others wearing indifference like it was in style.  

What I also know is I can’t save myself from my fate. That’s just facts. You see, now something else is living in me. It’s burning inside, and it’s helping me finally make a difference in this fight. Death has no power over me now. I’m not fighting for victory anymore. I’m fighting from victory. I’ve got a new name, and it’s written in a book I never knew existed.

“Are you ready to finish my story, old man?” I say to a man sitting at the café’s small table, overlooking his tea.

“Not bored anymore?” he says with a Cajun accent.

I look at him with amusement painted on my face. I can feel my expression shift as I look into his eyes. My eyes start to turn to steel, my lips fall to a neutral placement, my shoulders relax. I leave the café without my coffee.

He’s baiting me, I think to myself. If I fight him now, everything I’m doing will be lost.

Funny — I have things to lose now. I’ve got an entire police force to look into before anything. There are also others who need to hear the Truth.

They deserve to be given a choice. Even if they make the wrong one, they need to know choices exist. 
If you see this man with his zippo, just know he’s a liar. He only offers pain and suffering wrapped in golden lies.

1lst969,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lst969/aitah_for_my_sleep_habits/,AITAH for my sleep habits?,"I am not a great sleeper and have pretty bad ADHD so bedtime is usually pretty late for me because I find it hard to not seek stimulation. I usually go to bed later than 1 but am usually able to wake up at 6-7 if the baby needs a bottle of toddler drink and am usually up by 8. The problem is I nap sometimes. I take about one or max two “total crashed out” nap a week where I just sit somewhere comfy and unintentionally end up asleep. Usually it’s when our parents / others are helping us care for the baby. I’m a deep sleeper and if someone say to me “don’t nap right now” I literally respond with “I’m not sleeping” with my eyes closed and while asleep. I don’t often nap more than 2 hours and usually less than 1. 

My gf goes to bed before 11 most nights, maybe pushes 1 on weekends. 

She is mad at me for taking a nap 4-6 today. She came home (left while I was napping) and was giving me the silent treatment. I apologized for napping and said can we talk about it. She said I “always take naps and that it’s a multiple time a week thing” but got annoyed when I asked her to point out the last time I did that. I admit I nap more than her but she also claimed she “can’t do that” because I won’t let her and our baby needs something all the time. I said it’s ridiculous of her to say that because unlike her, who will tell me not to nap when I need one, I have never said to her “you can’t take a nap right now” and she has rarely said to me she needs a nap, when she does I usually take the baby on a drive or to my parents. She also often asks me to get up with our kid in the morning and wants to sleep in. Occasionally it will be to the point where we need to do something for him or get on with our day and I wake her up gently and half the time I bring her coffee in bed.

She said I need to tell her when I’m going to take a nap and she won’t mind if I just do that (I have my doubts she will say “okay, sounds good). I called her out and said that she won’t say she needs a nap and that I don’t intend to take them when I do. I also said she could be nicer about waking me up and she always swears she tries that but she is kind of quick to get impatient and annoyed sometimes, but I’m also difficult to wake up at times. 

I basically told her not to bring up arbitrary things like “you always do x” if she can’t think of some type of evidence to back her point and she was quiet. I was frustrated at this point and after stewing I said something like “you know what, something you always fucking do is the moment I sit down, you say “can you help me with this or do this” which I feel was pretty mean to say. I apologized for falling asleep, initiated a conversation about it and called her out for making unbacked claims, I was feeling defensive.

Anyways, a little about me: 33, I live in 2 places in the United States. I work on Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones. I work in 2 places; I’m busy and very intense. I don’t have lots of time for nonsense, but I consider myself a fair and kind person.

Here's a bit about myself: I genuinely seek the positive in people, yet I also rely on my intuition. While I have a solid circle of friends, most are married with children, which makes it difficult for us to spend time together. I fully respect their commitments, but it feels like our life paths are diverging right now. Therefore, I'm not looking to connect with married friends at this time; I’m open to friendships with those who are divorced, but I want to steer clear of any drama involving ex-partners—life's too short for that. 

As for me, I’m 33 years old and split my time between two locations in the United States. My work spans both Eastern Daylight Time and Pacific Time Zones, and I juggle responsibilities at two different jobs. I'm busy and focused, leaving little room for nonsense.

As a passionate reader and a devoted audiobooks enthusiast, I find immense joy in immersing myself in stories, especially while traveling. Listening to books is a practical way for me to indulge in literature, and there's something truly magical about the experience of being read to! I often crank up the speed to double time, so if you're up for a discussion about books, I’d absolutely love that. Recently, I was deeply moved by ""The River is Waiting"" by Wally Lamb; though it was a poignant read, it left a lasting impression on my heart and shifted my perspective on significant topics. That's the beauty of books for me!

Music truly means a lot to me. Right now, I'm putting together a dinner playlist that is coming together beautifully, featuring artists such as Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. I actually have a 20-hour playlist that includes a wide variety of genres. I recently stumbled upon the band “The Scarlet Opera,” and I'm really enjoying their sound. I have Apple Music, so if you're interested in checking out my playlists, that would be great!

I have a deep appreciation for theater, ballet, and opera. There's something truly enchanting about dressing up to enjoy these remarkable performances. However, I'm equally fond of TV and movies. While getting dressed for an night on a town  is enjoyable, I also cherish the comfort of donning sweatpants and a concert t-shirt while staying in.

I have a passion for dining out and discovering new restaurants. Although I enjoy cooking at home, I've recently found myself in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner venues with friends is my main focus. I’m a huge fan of iced coffee and love to share ample amounts of champagne with great company! Brunch, lunch, and food in general are all favorites of mine!



I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!   
Here are a  fun fact about me :During my college summers, I spent time working in Florida, where I had a job that involved a certain famous mouse. Any guesses on what I did?

I just finished watching the first episode of The Pitt and absolutely loved it! However, I'm watching it with my mom, and she texted me saying she can only handle one episode a night. Ugh!

I'm searching for someone between the ages of 26 and 50 who resides in the United States and has a preference for voting blue, just like I do. I’m not particularly interested in sports or video games, so if those are your main sources of entertainment, we may not be a good fit. Additionally, I'm not a fan of hiking or camping, so please keep that in mind!

I had a great idea, a talented team, and a big vision, but somehow, it just wasn't resonating with customers. It wasn't until I took a step back, re-assessed our market, and surrendered to the brutal honesty of our users that we finally cracked the code. In this post, I'll share the hard-won lessons learned from my journey to product-market fit, and hopefully, inspire fellow entrepreneurs to take a similar path.

I made the rookie mistake of assuming that our solution was unique and game-changing. But the market seemed unimpressed, and our early adopters were few and far between. We tried tweaking, refining, and even pivot-ing, but nothing seemed to stick. It was then that I realized we weren't alone – many businesses were struggling with the same issue.

The turning point came when we embarked on a series of user interviews, observing customer behavior, and scrutinizing their feedback. We discovered that our solution, while innovative, wasn't addressing their most pressing pain points. It was a humbling experience, but one that ultimately led us to create a product that customers actually wanted and needed.

The key takeaway was that product-market fit isn't about creating something sexy or revolutionary; it's about understanding your customers' problems and crafting a solution that tackles them head-on. It's about validating and iterating, rather than just building and hoping.

Throughout this journey, I've come to appreciate the value of empathy, experimentation, and persistence. Getting to market too quickly or thinking we had it all figured out proved to be costly mistakes. Instead, we took our time, remained adaptable, and listened to our users. In the end, it was this willingness to learn and iterate that led us to a product-market fit that has set our company on the path to success.",1,1751778217.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

But I am.,"I see a great deal of posts that read something along the lines of “I’m in my late 20s, haven’t been in a long-term relationship in 3 years, have had a few situationships but nothing serious-“ etc.

The people writing these feel as though their situation is miserable. Like nobody seems to want them. They think they’ve not had enough attention. All of this is a sentiment that I just can’t empathize with.

When I read these posts, all I can see are the positives. This person DID have a long term relationship. They DID have multiple hookups/short term flings. They DO get matches on dating apps. Maybe it’s not as much as they’d like, but how does one complain about a broken dating world when they do, in fact, see results?

I’m 26M. I have never been on a date. Never kissed a girl. Never gotten a real match on a dating app in 2+ years (I do have ~10 total matches that didn’t respond, I’m guessing bot accounts.) I’m confident in saying that I’m someone who genuinely has seen no payoff for my effort. No glimpse of hope that I’m at least orienting myself in the right direction.

And it’s not like I’m not trying. I’ve had friends review my dating profiles, I’ve approached women at bars, the gym, coffee shops, etc. I’ve done it enough where I feel like I’ve balanced my approach in the sense that I’m not too awkward but not too pushy, but who knows. I just get nowhere. Never even gotten close to a connection. My hobbies are also pretty male dominated, so I haven’t made any connections there either.

I’m not usually one to complain. I always try to think that there’s always something I can improve on. I understand nobody likes a negative Nancy. But it’s just too hard. I shouldn’t have to be perfect to get a date, or at least a (real) number. I am completely lost.

But circling back; if you have a relationship history, all is not lost. If you have had romantic connections before, you can get them again, no matter your age. That is only a logical conclusion.

But I’m 26. It’s not cute anymore. It’s starting to become obvious that there is something wrong with me. I just don’t know what.",1,1751777993.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

1lst2wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1lst2wt/married_couples_on_life_360/,Married couples on Life 360?,"My husband ( 51M ) and I ( 47F ) just got married 2 months ago. It’s a second marriage for both of us. We both have kids from our first marriages that have (almost) all but flown the nest. 
   
    First let me say that I love my husband to pieces. We have been with each other for 6 years and we are literally best friends. We both have a similar sense of humor and we find the weirdest things to be hilarious. We share a lot of the same interests and most of our long term goals are in sink with the other. 

   He filed for divorce from his first wife because she cheated on him. She even admitted this much to me when I met her for coffee one day. (I know.. sounds strange, but Long story short, I met him when he was separated from his wife, living separately and had already filed for divorce. But after two or three dates, I knew I really liked him but I needed to be certain I wasn’t being played by a guy who might be telling me a story about how “he was getting divorced”. I needed to make sure I wasn’t be played for a fool by a two timer. So I secretly contacted her, met her for coffee, told her I had the utmost respect for marriage and would never pursue anything with him if she still had hopes of working on her marriage to him. That’s when she told me that she had cheated on him and didn’t love him. She told me he was a great guy though and she gives us her blessing.) 

   Anyways, ya. So she cheated on him, which, for anyone who’s been cheated on, you feel the pinch of that for a long time after. It’s hard to trust people when you’ve been tricked and lied to by someone you loved and thought you could trust more than anyone. He filed divorce on her when he found out. A year later, we met. 


   I was already divorced by that point. I filed for divorce from my husband because he became hyper obsessed with accusing me of cheating for two years. It was the longest two years of my life. I NEVER cheated on him or any of my relationships before that. I loved him more than anything. I don’t believe in cheating and I pride myself in being a woman of integrity. I would break up with someone long before I’d ever cheat on them. And even though it might be possible to cheat on a spouse without them finding out, if I cheated on him, there’s no way I could escape from knowing that about myself. I would feel so low about myself. I just wouldn’t cheat. I never have and I never would. My moral conviction on its wrongfulness is just something I’ve never wavered on. 

I loved my husband to pieces. I was proud and honored to be his wife. I wanted him to get better so our marriage would heal and get strong again, but his paranoia and delusions of me cheating on him morphed into this evil beast that consumed him a little more each day. It got ugly; real ugly. His accusations were over the top and not logical or even remotely realistic. 

   It all started when I went from being a stay at home mom to waitressing at a family restaurant a few nights a week for some supplemental income. He hated having me leave the house and right from day one, he said “this is the beginning of the end”. He told me that all women who work outside the home end up cheating on their husbands. It was just a matter of time. It saddened me that he was worried about that, but I tried my best to assure him that I would never ever cheat on him. But he was convinced it was inevitable and nothing would change his mind. 

    Over the course of the next two years, the accusations became almost daily. The interrogations, more invasive and outlandish. He started taking measures he thought would bust me cheating. He secretly installed a keyboard tracker on our home computer to catch me writing emails to men. 8 months after, when he had been reading everything I ever wrote on the computer and found no such evidence of infidelity, rather than admit he was wrong, he said I must have “partitioned the hard drive” and the sectioned segment I secretly used was protected from his tracker. I barely knew how to send an email at the time. But he wouldn’t hear of anything unless it confirmed what he was convinced of. So he hauled our home computer yo the Apple computer people and told them he needed to find the proof that I was in contact with men. (Mind you, I had 4 children at the time, all under 7 and 2 of which were in diapers) Anyways, the computer analysts charged him $800 and told them they didn’t find anything to support his fears about me. 
That’s when he came home in tears, confessed he had put a tracker on the computer and came clean about the computer people not finding anything. He apologized, begged me to forgive him and promised he’d change. Of course I forgave him, but the next day he’d be back at it. The next week he said he discovered my secret porn sight. As he confronted me with these images of headless nude women telling me that he knows it’s my body, I pointed out some major discrepancies with that accusation. This lady was missing some key freckles and moles that are very prominent on me and gained some in places I don’t have any. Of course he dismissed this as a trivial detail and said that I had probably learned how to airbrush photos… and apparently I was getting very creative too. 

He began to review my phone calls on a nightly basis. He’d log into Verizon online and pull up the phone calls under my number. On the rare occasion I didn’t recall who the number belonged to, he’d have me call the number right in front of him. I felt a little weird doing it, but I knew I wasn’t hiding anything. One time it was the tire department because he asked me that morning to get some quotes. One time it was a kids consignment store I had been to. The night time phone call reviews became integrated into our evening activities as if it was totally normal. 

Then he had me bring in my clock-in/clock-out slips from work to prove I had been there and not out with a secret boyfriend. Somehow that eventually wasn’t enough for him and I had to also call him from my work number when I got there and before I left. 

Then he secretly put a gps tracker in my car… twice. I had no idea about it until he accused me of having sex after work in the cvs parking lot during my 5 minute detour from work to home. But he had forgotten that that morning he had asked me to pick up a few things after work. 

The name calling escalated and the accusations became so far fetched that the only person who was convinced they were true was him. Even In the absence of any evidence to support his claim of my infidelity, he religiously interrogated me and accused me of the most hurtful, dirty things. And it was especially hurtful because I was trying to be a good wife to him. I took care of our young children all day and worked a few nights to help our finances. I loved him, but his paranoia got the best of him and slowly deteriorated the character of the man I had fallen in love with. I knew I didn’t deserve to be treated the way he was treating me and I knew my kids deserved better than to see/hear their dad call their mom horrible things and to lie about me. 

I wrote a letter to doctor Phil begging for help and explaining that I was on my last straw. I wanted to save my marriage and my family but I was at my breaking point. I needed help. I asked doctor Phil if there was any way he could have his polygrapher hook me up and he could ask me all the questions about cheating. I figured then I could prove to my husband that I didn’t do even 1 of the things he had accused me of for the past two years. 

The producers wrote me back and called me back and after about a month of going back and forth with collecting additional info, they officially invited us to be on the show. 

Both my husband and I were thrilled thinking that this would be a fresh start for us. For the first time in a long time, I had some tangible hope that things could and would only get better from here. This emotional torment might finally end. I was exhausted, but elated at the opportunity. We both were. 

But a week before we were supposed to board our plans for the show, my husband said he refused to participate if the lie detector guy was going to be there. I didn’t get it because that woulda been a great way to know for sure that I didn’t cheat or text or call or email any guy ever. But something about the lie detector test made him get cold feet. Then he just said no, he changed his mind and wouldn’t be going to the show. 
So that was it for me. That night I told him to pack his bags and get lost. I filed for divorce the next morning. 

So now, I have this awesome guy who I’ve been with for 6 years and just married. Well recently, he thought it would be a great idea to get life 360 on our phones.  I know a lot of couples use that and find it even helpful at times. He argues that it’s great for emergencies or to know if I got forced into a double shift at work. (I can’t bring my phone on the floor with me; it has to stay in the work locker) so with life 360, even if I cannot text him to tell him I got forced onto a double, he can just log into 360 and confirm this for himself. 

   I told him I’d do it on a trial basis, but that I find it very creepy. And I still have it on but I just have an unsettling knot in the pit of my stomach ever since. I feel a little less excited about being married to him now. I know it’s probably just some left over trauma from what I dealt with from my ex, but I just feel like it’s just a matter of time before I’m being questioned about things. He has a very sedentary, very boring position in his company. He basically sits there watching YouTube all day. So I know for a fact he is sitting there watching my car drive to work, the grocery store or wherever. And I know in his case, it’s probably out of extreme boredom. But it doesn’t change the fact that I am on the receiving end of it. I have zero privacy. Every place I might happen to stop at, I could be subject to an interrogation over. And I know that a lot of people are of the belief that if you aren’t up to anything shady, then you have nothing to hide. But bring on the butt end of that for so many years, I know how crappy it feels to be interrogated when you did nothing wrong to deserve the interrogation. If I have done nothing except for being a loving, loyal, hard working, responsible, faithful wife, then I shouldn’t have to be tracked and I did nothing to justify losing basic privacies that everyone is entitled to without having to explain every move you make. 

I dunno. I’ll be amazed if anyone made it this far. I know I can get carried away, but I was just hoping to glean some perspective/opinions. Do you guys like being gps tracked like a disobedient teenager who’s got a curfew to abide by? 
I just feel so discouraged already. 

It makes me just want to throw away my phone. I know if I tell him that I hate the app and I wanna get rid of it, he’s gonna piss and moan about it because, bottom line, he just wants to track me for his own comfort. His ex wife of many years cheated on him so deep down, I think it gives him some peace of mind to know exactly where I am. But unfortunately, I was with a guy who constantly accused me of doing something evil… that I was 100% innocent of and I absolutely despise answering a million little questions or having to explain myself when I have done nothing to warrant the scrutiny. 

I work in L/E and I work a lot of doubles. It’s a highly stressful environment. Sometimes on my way home from work, I pull into this parking lot that is at the entrance of a nature reserve. I like to roll down my windows and take in the fresh air for five or ten minutes before I go home. I love the solitude, the peace and quiet, the fresh air, the brief reprieve from life for a minute. He doesn’t know that I do this because it’s a me thing and it’s relatively insignificant, and it’s my business, not his. I don’t think he would even understand about cherishing  just a few minutes of relaxation and taking in the fresh air. He would probably say, oh I guess you didn’t miss me that much if you don’t even wanna come home right away. I just don’t like to be questioned about things when I know I’m not doing anything wrong, I’m a grown ass adult and it’s simply no one else’s business. I’m trying to figure out how to reconcile two distanced mindsets and to see where I’m being reasonable vs. unreasonable. I appreciate other perspectives.

My Love,

This may be the most important thing I’ve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the marrow of me. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn’t small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn’t know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years.

We weren’t falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected,something rare. We didn’t choose it. It chose us.

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. But I now see that even the deepest love can’t thrive without healing. And it wasn’t the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn’t yet faced. That’s on me.

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I’ve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way. And because I want you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first person I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a “forever sounds good” kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you let me. That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn’t end at death. It doesn’t even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, you will never hear my voice raised in anger. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and then some. With all seven of our children, with all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. I don’t want a perfect love. I want ours. I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the forgiveness when we’re tired, the honesty when we’re scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone.

This is not just my truth. This is my invitation. To you. To us. To what I believe is the greatest love story ever told not because it’s flawless, but because it is real. And real love? It deserves to fight. It deserves to rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready.

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I’m here. I am already home. All that’s missing is you.

Forever and Always

1lst17c,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1lst17c/how_much_coffee_do_you_need_to_make_cold_brew/,How much coffee do you need to make cold brew?,"As a coffee lover, I've been experimenting with cold brew for a while now. It's become my go-to summer drink, and I've learned a lot about getting the perfect ratio of coffee to water. If you're new to cold brew or just looking to up your game, I'm here to share what I've discovered.

The basic rule of thumb for cold brew is to use a 1:4 ratio of coffee to water. This means for every 1 part of coffee grounds, you'll use 4 parts of water. But here's the thing - this isn't set in stone. You can adjust it based on how strong you like your coffee.

I usually start with 1 cup of coarsely ground coffee to 4 cups of cold water. This gives me a pretty strong concentrate that I can dilute later if needed. If you prefer a milder taste, you might want to try a 1:5 or even 1:6 ratio.

One thing I've learned is that the type of coffee maker you use can make a big difference. I recently switched to an iced coffee maker I found on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers), and it's been a game-changer. It makes the whole process so much easier and cleaner.

Now, let's talk about brew time. Cold brew needs to steep for at least 12 hours, but I find 18-24 hours gives the best flavor. The longer you let it sit, the stronger it gets. Just remember, you're making a concentrate here. You'll dilute it with water or milk when you're ready to drink it.

Another tip: use filtered water if you can. It makes a noticeable difference in taste. And don't forget to stir your mixture before you let it steep. This ensures all the grounds are fully saturated.

When it comes to grinding your beans, coarse is the way to go. Think sea salt texture. If your grounds are too fine, you'll end up with a bitter, over-extracted brew.

Once your cold brew is ready, strain it well. A fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth works great. Or, if you're using an iced coffee maker like the ones I found (https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers), it usually comes with a built-in filter which makes this step super easy.

Store your concentrate in the fridge. It'll keep for up to two weeks, though in my house it never lasts that long!

When you're ready to drink, dilute your concentrate with an equal part of water or milk. Add ice, and you're good to go. You can also get creative with flavors - try adding a splash of vanilla syrup or a sprinkle of cinnamon.

Cold brew is incredibly versatile. You can drink it cold or heat it up for a smooth hot coffee. It's less acidic than regular brewed coffee, which is easier on your stomach and teeth.

Remember, making cold brew is all about experimenting to find what works best for you. Start with the 1:4 ratio, and adjust from there. Play around with different beans, grind sizes, and steep times. Before you know it, you'll be a cold brew expert!",1,1751777717.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1lsswy2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsswy2,Feedback on multigenerational renovation,"We're planning a major renovation on our bungalow to better accommodate our family (3 kids under 5) and my mom. She is currently occupying the primary bedroom and we all share the current kitchen/living areas.

I've included our plan with changes so far, and the original/current floor plan for comparison.

The goal is to create another living area for our family to use as needed, sufficient bedrooms for our family, and to update my mom's bathroom to be more accessible. My mom's request is to not touch her bedroom or her living areas (ie. existing dining, kitchen, living). These areas have been highlighted in red/pink in the floor plan.

We're adding 3 bedrooms in a proposed bump out, one of which my husband and I will use and the other 2 shared between the 3 kids. The plan is whenever the time comes where my mom is no longer with us, my husband and I will move to the primary bedroom and each kid will get their own room.

Other added rooms/areas that are pretty much mandatory for our family: drop zone, dedicated powder room, scullery and laundry. We plan to still share the main kitchen, but have added a wet bar for some basic cooking, making coffee, etc.

We have a hidden thruway between our new family room and my mom's bedroom hallway so we can have easier access to the laundry, and the kids will just have a kick out of this 'secret entry' into grandma's side of the house.

House is on acreage so privacy is not an issue. We're losing the garage to accommodate the additional living space, but we'll build a detached garage down the line.

Basement is currently finished with its own apartment and office space for us.

We're working with a drafter, and not an architect. Curious if anyone has any constructive feedback on our intended plans and if there's any way to improve the flow or remove certain elements. My only concerns are actually how to furnish the new family room (where to orient the couch for instance) or closets and beds in the bedrooms.

🎼 the story of today thus far, plus some extras 😘

____

but first, a story with a rant:

after last night's adventure and having been incredibly exhausted both physically and mentally I moved slowly in everything I did self-care wise once I got in.

  * I made myself ""dinner"" at 2:30ish am last night, my ""poverty food"" as my still-husband [abbrv ""s-h"" going forward *>my puns are **always** intended<*] calls it. that story right quick: 
   - he calls me up thurs evening when he was leaving work, ""order a pizza.""  [no, he never said please, even after I later called it out]. 
   - chat about the logistics/whatnot for a min 
   - I mention a text I had sent him, offering him a can of off-brand spaghetti-o's. this was a can of food I picked up from the food pantry the day prior. I have no income and no financial assistance at this time and while the items I may select aren't ideal, it is food in my belly. 
   - he laughs and said ""thank you for sharing your *poverty food*"" and declines acceptance. this is coming from a person who had earlier in the week scolded me for eating the majority of the ramen he had bought a few weeks prior and said up front was for share. 
   - 🤬  this is a single example of what I must endure in order to keep a roof over my head at this time. *it gets much, much worse.* 
 * my poverty meal: 
   - a can of campbell's tomato bisque soup acquired from said food pantry. I added adobo, za'atar, and sage during the second nuke thru the microwave. after that I added my chia seed & hemp heart mix along with some plain sunflower seeds:

    - 2 johnny pop brand ice pops, as found at costco. to note, this is my first time trying them and I absolutely love them. they have kind of a softer bite/taste to them than a standard ice pop, have a good flavor, and i adore the sayings that appear once the ice pop is finished

so now to me and my big mouth, aka oops pt 2 of my grand scheme to sing publicly:


my circadian rhythm has been realigning itself the more time I spend outdoors and the more time I spend ""exercising"" [aka me moving my thousands of pounds of shit re: divorce]. it also doesn't help that I sleep right next to the front door, my head closest to said door. s-h leaves for work at about 8am & this wakes me up as well. 

I didn't fall asleep last night until after 4am and now here I am awake at 7:30ish am. I clearly missed my crucial 5 hour mark to avoid my mania. in fact, I was *so* exhausted last night when I feel asleep [took 12 min according to my galaxy watch] that I put my cpap on my face but totally forgot to turn the damn thing on. 😑🤦‍♀️ 

after doing some minor crap, including some redditing, for about an hour I was able to go back to sleep, mit meine cpap on this time. I slept from about 8:30 until about 1:45 pm. 

bingo! sleep requirement satisfied! 

feeeeeck - my day is starting so far behind schedule.

oh well, off to the races I go. still gotta do what I have to do, including holding to my words to the folks on the internets. 

ya'll, this is my kitchen as I walked into it last night:

https://preview.redd.it/8x8onkp3n6bf1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41d7c772505ec5ee4a52d0bcf3e013226a85fa1

folks,

**this is *[mostly]* not my mess** 

at this point I had one dirty dish laying about: my coffee spoon located on top of a piece of paper towel atop the sugar canister in front of *my* coffee machine. I also was the one to put the sheet of paper towel on the microwave where the handle should be. and here is *that* short story: 
* when we moved here back in October 2013 they told us that if there were ever to be an issue with the microwave the complex would be removing it to be replaced by a vent fan. we're not people of means so we've done our best to keep that stupid ancient thing working. the plastic handle began cracking off years ago, so I used some electrical tape to hold it in place. earlier this week that handle broke off completely [not my doing, i found it that way], leaving years of gooey black tape residue behind. the paper towel is sticking to it & you can still open the door - now without having to touch the ick [which sticks to your fingers]. no, idgaffios [flying fart in outer space] what it looks like because the damn thing still works. 

the kitchen remained largely unchanged today as s-h had work and I my other tasks. plus, why should I have to be the one to clean this? fr tho... 

it's near 7pm now and I'm prepping to head out to do my video. s-h gets home from work. after a few min of a little general chat I ask him ""could you please do something about the kitchen?"" 

without skipping a beat, ""probably not, I just worked 12 hours."" 

""okay well I had wanted to cook today but can't because there's no space to do so."" 

he proceeds to say something about me bitching while he was the one who worked. 

me: ""you're the one who complains about putting dirty dishes into the sink. there is no space to do *anything* in that kitchen. I'm talking about me needing to make food so I can eat."" 

""you want dishes moved then"" [something something I don't remember verbatim - something I think along the lines of him doing this]. 

at this point I disengaged from that convo as I [hope] I got my point across and I had shit to do. 

ya'll - this is coming from a man who has on multiple occasions told me he thinks that I am ""crazy, manic, and schizo"". 

I am so far from shitting you. 

SO - 

now is when i'm *finally* walking out the door to go do my video. 

i walked about 3/4mi from my apartment to a wide open space away from folks, set my stuff up, and recorded my singing. one-take was all I got. that's all I tend to do anyway. 

I listened to it on my walk back home. 

ya'll..... no. 

hell no. 

it was baaaaaaad. off pitch in so many places and super rushed. 

one day I may share it one day for comparison's sake, but today is **not** that day, and nor is tomorrow 🤣 

I did none of those ladies justice. 

I can, and will, do better next time. 

I will say this: I brought a tape measure with me *[because we humans do smart things the smart way]* to measure how far i was from the cam. max 25 feet. in order I did alicia [14 ft], christina [17 ft], then mariah [25 ft]. 

the volume of my voice was in no way an issue and, as far as I could tell from playback on my 2010 video camera [yup, creative problem solving ftfw], my volume was consist across the entire video - by this I mean my volume remained level regardless of distance. 😏 

____ 

tomorrow is a new day. my challenge to myself to do this continues. 

lessons learned, mental notes taken. 

here's hoping third time will be the charm ✨️ 


and now i will take my still-tired pretty little butt to bed, where i sleep under my own stars: [https://youtu.be/a-7FXIZ6Stg?si=LfRfLfl0V5RtT-2t](https://youtu.be/a-7FXIZ6Stg?si=LfRfLfl0V5RtT-2t)

And sorry it’s a long one.

So, some context, me (24F) and my husband (25M) met in 2019 when we were both 17 years old - you could say childhood sweethearts. We met in a group met up with my girlfriends and he was invited as one of the friends of a boyfriend in the group. We instantly liked each other and when I came home, I immediately told my mum (52F) when I got home about “the handsome boy I met”. Turns out, he told his parents about me as soon as he got home too. For some extra detail: he is from South Africa and is white - this is important for later. 

So onto the story, we got married after 5 years of dating, in 2024, and immediately got pregnant with a honeymoon baby. Before anyone starts in the comments, we both agreed being young parents was what was right for both of us, we are both engineers and can support our children the way they deserve. My mum…well she was super excited at the beginning of our relationship, but it seemed to dwindle over the years, specifically after meeting my husband for the first time. I had asked her countless times over the years about it and she always said it was in my head. Then my engagement came. Obviously, I wanted her involved in everything and I thought she’d be so excited as I’m her only girl, the oldest child and first to be engaged. But, she wasn’t. She kept asking if I was sure about him, but I thought it was just because we were young and I kept repeating that I had no doubts and he was the love of my life. 

On my wedding day she was super supportive and happy to see me get married, as was my father. Then we announced the first pregnancy…and she lost it. She kept going on about if the baby was actually his, or if I had slept with someone else! This went on for months, as we slowly lost contact with her, and my father by extension (who I have no problem with - other than always being in my mother’s side, no matter what). When my daughter was born, my mother came into the room, held her and exclaimed “I’m so glad it’s a girl, at least she will be like her mother and not her father” and gave a dirty look to my husband. We let it go, and had a wonderful few weeks with our newborn, then the topic came up, and we decided to have a conversation with my mother. 

We went to my mum and dad’s house and sat down for a talk, we asked about the comment on that day, and all the other weird reactions my mother had had towards my husband. She began by denying and defending, but eventual let it out that she never approved of me being with “someone of his type”. We asked what the hell she meant by that and she admitted to thinking lesser of people from third world countries. Obviously, I saw RED. I screamed, I cried and I told them they would never see their grandchild again. She started crying and said that her grand baby shouldn’t be punished because of their disgusting father. This shocked me, as my mother isn’t racist, she adores my brother’s girlfriend who is black and Scottish (we’re Irish) so it didn’t make sense that she was xenophobic, but she is. I looked to my father who had his face buried in his hands, he didn’t say anything for the 20 minutes my mother and I were screaming at each other. We cut them out for good.

Then, we got pregnant this year and just found out it’s a boy! This is where my predicament begins. My father reached out after his friend sent him the announcement of our darling boy. He was begging for a chance to meet his grandchildren, left voicemails crying, texts, emails, anything he could, so I felt a little bad for him. I talked with my husband about it and we agreed we would both meet him in a coffee shop, but without my mother. We met, we talked about the kids and about him, he said he had been planning to leave my mother after that conversation anyway, but he admitted to never having the guts until he saw he was missing out on a second grandchild. I told him anyone who couldn’t agree with my children being half of my husbands could never be in their lives, and he fully agreed, he said he never supported my mother’s hatred, and had he known about it, he never would have married her. We left the conversation confused and worried. We weren’t sure if this was my mother’s way of getting in, as I felt I didn’t know her anymore, she never presented this kind of bigotry in my childhood.

My dad turned up to our home 2 days later with signed divorce papers and proof that he was going to try and get custody of my brother who is turning 18 soon. My father knows I have been begging my brother to get out of that house for years. I cherish my brother with all my heart and he will always he the best uncle my kids could ever have, with the very little money he makes in his part time job, he spends it on my daughter, outings, toys, etc. My brother believes my dad is a good man who just got roped in with a terrible woman, so there’s my question Reddit, do I let him back into my life after he didn’t defend my husband or kids for a year after my mother disrespected them?",3,1751776745.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for a roommate (any gender) to team up and find a 2 bed / 2 bath apartment in the Culver City / Palms / Silver Lake / La Brea / Fairfax area. My budget is $1500–$2000/month each, and I’m looking to move in by July 25th (flexible by a week or so).

About me:
• 27M, working full-time in management consulting (hybrid)
• Just finished my MBA from USC
• Clean, easygoing, and respectful of shared spaces
• Social but chill – I love exploring LA, coffee shops, music, hikes, and also really value downtime
• Looking to make the apartment feel like a calm, cozy space we both enjoy coming home to

What I’m looking for:
Someone in their 20s/early 30s who’s clean, respectful, and easy to communicate with. Bonus if you’re friendly and open to the occasional hang but also value your own space.

If this sounds like a good fit—or if you know someone looking—DM me! Would love to chat and find a great place together 🙌

I had to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews and Instagram comments. It's slow, tedious, and you always miss things.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude can't do this, they hit a wall on protected pages. So, I built a fully automated system using n8n that can.

This agent can:

* Scrape reviews for any Amazon product and give a summarised version or complete text of the reviews.
* Analyse the comments on Instagram post to gauge sentiment.
* Track pricing data, scrape regional news, and a lot more.

This system now tracks over 500,000 data points across amazon pages and social accounts for my company, and it helped us improve our messaging on ad pages and amazon listings.

**The stack:**

* **Agent:** Self-hosted n8n instance on Render (I literally found the easiest way to set this up, I have covered it in the video below)
* **Scraping:** Bright Data's Web Unlocker API, which handles proxies, and CAPTCHAs. I connected it via a Smithery MCP server, which makes it dead simple to use.
* **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT-4o mini, to understand requests and summarize the scraped data.
* **Data Storage:** A free Supabase project to store all the outputs.

Because I was playing a game and idk if my anger towards the game may have been projected towards my friend(even though im sure my tone that time was how it usually is) but after that, that friend became quiet and cold towards me especially when i talked to her so I just distanced myself from them and became quiet as well and after class they said that we were going to grab coffee I just declined and made up an excuse because I didn’t want to go and when I said that I have to go I wasn’t smiling and I heard one of them say that I had an attitude because I was very quiet that time(I usually smile when I have to go) so Im currently thinking that when they went out for coffee they were talking about me. And fast forward to today, I just saw on tiktok one of my friends reposting a video that feels very targeted towards me which caused me to make this post because im starting to feel again that they don’t like me. Emphasis on the again because this already happened when we were 1st yr, because last time I was the person the group would always tease and make fun of, which was fine for me but sometimes they would always take it too far which caused me to shift in mood and just get away from them and they would always say that I was overreacting a lot because of something small and that they always tease me because they “love” me and that’s their way of doing that towards me. But even if they say that I always felt a sort of distance towards me like in group projects for example if we were 5 and the group can only have 4, I would always be the first one to go, and if I say something like to go eat somewhere or even if i just ask something, they would sometimes get ticked off by it but if someone else would do that they aren’t as aggressive in reacting like how they do with me, that was already an issue last year where I fully distanced myself from them for a while and when we made up and they told their side they just said that they understood they went too far with the jokes(which helped since they usually don’t go too far with those anymore) but they also said that because of what they did they were fine with cutting me off for good which put me off and made me think that Im not that important to them.

1lssmft,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lssmft/aio_my_husband_joked_during_a_deep_vulnerable/,"AIO? My husband joked during a deep, vulnerable conversation that “I’m the dog at the pound with one eye that everyone returns”…","For context, we’ve been married for about 7 years and together 11 years. My childhood was turbulent - 4 foster homes, I always got attached to the mothers and then re-homed, I loved my mum deeply but she chose drugs always and died of an overdose about 6 years ago. My dad also did not take me when I went to foster care, although he had the option. I moved out of home at 15. 

Last Christmas, there was a huge blow up with my husbands mum. She exploded and said incredibly hurtful things to me and about me. We had been so close; she called me her daughter and I truly saw her as the mum I never had. For 9 years she’s been my mum to me. I honestly don’t think the things I had done wrong in her opinion were worth the way she exploded, I think it was more a culmination of her own stress and trauma that was outburst onto me. She’s been through a lot and lost a child 15 years ago, so I can’t imagine the trauma her heart is carrying. But she said things along the lines of me ruining my husbands life due to me having health + fertility issues and that I was a drain on the family… In the morning, I think she honestly regretted it but has been maybe too ashamed or full of pride to repair things. It’s been 6 months and she’s blocked me out of her life. Recently it was my birthday, the first birthday she hasn’t called me in 9 or 10 years. I was devastated. I have tried to approach her and work things out, but she’s overseas so she just ignores txts and phone calls from me. 

I was having a heart to heart with my husband about how sad i am to have lost this close relationship with his mum, despite how she treated me. I was trying to brainstorm ways to repair our relationship. I explained how my mental health has been struggling because I feel this has activated all my childhood wounds of never being good enough to have a mother stick by me. All I’ve ever wanted is parents, even now in my 30’s (although that’s embarrassing to say). I always long for having a parent just to rely on or go for coffee with, that sounds like a dream.

He was uncomfortable and has been struggling mentally since the big family fight. He doesn’t know how to help and has been avoiding it, more from a freeze response than out of malice or incompetence. But during our conversation today, as I was crying about never feeling wanted or having family, he joked “what are you putting out there? It’s like you’re the one eyed dog at the pound everyone keeps passing or returning”. I know he was uncomfortable and deflected to humour, and he’s hurting by the family divide, but I’m devastated. I don’t know how to unhear what he said. It was like my biggest wound being mirrored back to me, that it’s all my fault I never had parental love. 

I’ve been silent since and I don’t know how to move forward, despite him apologising constantly.

*The camera pans to a sterile office environment, uniform gray walls, a desk cluttered with neatly stacked files, and a digital tablet displaying containment protocols. Behind the desk sits Dr. Marshan Benkowitz, wearing a crisp suit jacket over a plain white shirt. His posture is rigidly formal, hands folded on the desk. The faint hum of fluorescent lighting fills the silence before he begins speaking.*  

> ""Ahoy, there! I'm Dr. Marshan Benkowitz, the spokesman for The Morinis Foundation. If you're tuning in expecting theatrics or grandstanding, I regret to inform you that this will not be that  kind of introduction. My predecessor—Douglas Quint Harland—had quite the flair for dramatics. Unfortunately, his penchant for rewriting reality, lacing drinks with amnestics, and generally making life difficult for everyone else has left us all...rather exasperated."" 

*He pauses briefly, adjusting his glasses with a deliberate motion.*  

>""To summarize: Harland fabricated credentials, meddled with timelines, and ultimately got himself shot by Judge Lysandra Vex during what was supposed to be a fair trial. While her methods were unconventional—and perhaps somewhat excessive—they did manage to restore order. So, let’s call it...'problem-solving through decisive action.' Though next time, we’ll aim for less gunfire and more paperwork."" 

*A faint smirk crosses his face, but it vanishes almost instantly as he continues.*  

>""My role here is simple: transparency within reason, efficiency without compromise, and ensuring that no one else tries to play fast and loose with causality, or our coffee supply. To that end, allow me to provide a brief overview of my qualifications, so you understand why I’m uniquely suited to this position."" 

*He leans back slightly, ticking off points on his fingers as if delivering a lecture.*  

>""I hold a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Blackveil, where I specialized in understanding anomalous cognition and its implications for both human behavior and containment strategies. Additionally, I earned a Master’s in Public Administration, which equipped me with the skills necessary to navigate bureaucratic red tape, a skill set that proves invaluable when dealing with interdepartmental squabbles over funding allocations."" 

*His tone shifts ever so slightly toward sarcasm.*  

>""Because nothing screams ‘teamwork’ like arguing over who gets stuck footing the bill for another Class-7 breach cleanup."" 

*Clearing his throat, he presses on.*  

>""I also possess a Bachelor of Arts in Rhetoric & Communications, because apparently convincing people to listen to reason requires more than just cold logic. And yes, I completed a Postgraduate Certificate in Public Marketing, though I assure you, I use those skills responsibly. No fabricated press releases or viral misinformation campaigns under my watch."" 

*He gestures to a framed certificate hanging on the wall behind him.*  

>""As for certifications, I’m a Certified Information Security Officer (CISO), meaning I take data breaches very seriously, even when they involve eldritch entities trying to whisper secrets into Wi-Fi routers. I’ve also achieved Level 4 Containment Breach Protocol Certification, which means I know exactly what to do when things go sideways, and trust me, they often do. Furthermore, I’m a Certified Ethical Persuasion Practitioner (CEPP), trained in resolving disputes without resorting to outright mind control. Finally, I’m an Anomalous Incident Debriefing Specialist (AIDspec), ensuring that every debriefing session ends with actionable insights rather than existential dread."" 

*He adjusts his tie, his expression softening marginally.*  

>""In short, I’m here to ensure stability, accountability, and minimal collateral damage. We’ve had enough chaos to last several lifetimes, and it’s high time we focused on doing our jobs effectively with integrity, precision, and perhaps the occasional well-timed quip."" 

*Leaning forward again, he locks eyes with the camera.*

1lssj6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lssj6a/whats_your_opinion_51m_vs_47f_married_life_360/,"What’s your opinion? 51M vs. 47F  married,  life 360","My husband ( 51M ) and I ( 47F ) just got married 2 months ago. It’s a second marriage for both of us. We both have kids from our first marriages that have (almost) all but flown the nest. 
   
    First let me say that I love my husband to pieces. We have been with each other for 6 years and we are literally best friends. We both have a similar sense of humor and we find the weirdest things to be hilarious. We share a lot of the same interests and most of our long term goals are in sink with the other. 

   He filed for divorce from his first wife because she cheated on him. She even admitted this much to me when I met her for coffee one day. (I know.. sounds strange, but Long story short, I met him when he was separated from his wife, living separately and had already filed for divorce. But after two or three dates, I knew I really liked him but I needed to be certain I wasn’t being played by a guy who might be telling me a story about how “he was getting divorced”. I needed to make sure I wasn’t be played for a fool by a two timer. So I secretly contacted her, met her for coffee, told her I had the utmost respect for marriage and would never pursue anything with him if she still had hopes of working on her marriage to him. That’s when she told me that she had cheated on him and didn’t love him. She told me he was a great guy though and she gives us her blessing.) 

   Anyways, ya. So she cheated on him, which, for anyone who’s been cheated on, you feel the pinch of that for a long time after. It’s hard to trust people when you’ve been tricked and lied to by someone you loved and thought you could trust more than anyone. He filed divorce on her when he found out. A year later, we met. 


   I was already divorced by that point. I filed for divorce from my husband because he became hyper obsessed with accusing me of cheating for two years. It was the longest two years of my life. I NEVER cheated on him or any of my relationships before that. I loved him more than anything. I don’t believe in cheating and I pride myself in being a woman of integrity. I would break up with someone long before I’d ever cheat on them. And even though it might be possible to cheat on a spouse without them finding out, if I cheated on him, there’s no way I could escape from knowing that about myself. I would feel so low about myself. I just wouldn’t cheat. I never have and I never would. My moral conviction on its wrongfulness is just something I’ve never wavered on. 

I loved my husband to pieces. I was proud and honored to be his wife. I wanted him to get better so our marriage would heal and get strong again, but his paranoia and delusions of me cheating on him morphed into this evil beast that consumed him a little more each day. It got ugly; real ugly. His accusations were over the top and not logical or even remotely realistic. 

   It all started when I went from being a stay at home mom to waitressing at a family restaurant a few nights a week for some supplemental income. He hated having me leave the house and right from day one, he said “this is the beginning of the end”. He told me that all women who work outside the home end up cheating on their husbands. It was just a matter of time. It saddened me that he was worried about that, but I tried my best to assure him that I would never ever cheat on him. But he was convinced it was inevitable and nothing would change his mind. 

    Over the course of the next two years, the accusations became almost daily. The interrogations, more invasive and outlandish. He started taking measures he thought would bust me cheating. He secretly installed a keyboard tracker on our home computer to catch me writing emails to men. 8 months after, when he had been reading everything I ever wrote on the computer and found no such evidence of infidelity, rather than admit he was wrong, he said I must have “partitioned the hard drive” and the sectioned segment I secretly used was protected from his tracker. I barely knew how to send an email at the time. But he wouldn’t hear of anything unless it confirmed what he was convinced of. So he hauled our home computer yo the Apple computer people and told them he needed to find the proof that I was in contact with men. (Mind you, I had 4 children at the time, all under 7 and 2 of which were in diapers) Anyways, the computer analysts charged him $800 and told them they didn’t find anything to support his fears about me. 
That’s when he came home in tears, confessed he had put a tracker on the computer and came clean about the computer people not finding anything. He apologized, begged me to forgive him and promised he’d change. Of course I forgave him, but the next day he’d be back at it. The next week he said he discovered my secret porn sight. As he confronted me with these images of headless nude women telling me that he knows it’s my body, I pointed out some major discrepancies with that accusation. This lady was missing some key freckles and moles that are very prominent on me and gained some in places I don’t have any. Of course he dismissed this as a trivial detail and said that I had probably learned how to airbrush photos… and apparently I was getting very creative too. 

He began to review my phone calls on a nightly basis. He’d log into Verizon online and pull up the phone calls under my number. On the rare occasion I didn’t recall who the number belonged to, he’d have me call the number right in front of him. I felt a little weird doing it, but I knew I wasn’t hiding anything. One time it was the tire department because he asked me that morning to get some quotes. One time it was a kids consignment store I had been to. The night time phone call reviews became integrated into our evening activities as if it was totally normal. 

Then he had me bring in my clock-in/clock-out slips from work to prove I had been there and not out with a secret boyfriend. Somehow that eventually wasn’t enough for him and I had to also call him from my work number when I got there and before I left. 

Then he secretly put a gps tracker in my car… twice. I had no idea about it until he accused me of having sex after work in the cvs parking lot during my 5 minute detour from work to home. But he had forgotten that that morning he had asked me to pick up a few things after work. 

The name calling escalated and the accusations became so far fetched that the only person who was convinced they were true was him. Even In the absence of any evidence to support his claim of my infidelity, he religiously interrogated me and accused me of the most hurtful, dirty things. And it was especially hurtful because I was trying to be a good wife to him. I took care of our young children all day and worked a few nights to help our finances. I loved him, but his paranoia got the best of him and slowly deteriorated the character of the man I had fallen in love with. I knew I didn’t deserve to be treated the way he was treating me and I knew my kids deserved better than to see/hear their dad call their mom horrible things and to lie about me. 

I wrote a letter to doctor Phil begging for help and explaining that I was on my last straw. I wanted to save my marriage and my family but I was at my breaking point. I needed help. I asked doctor Phil if there was any way he could have his polygrapher hook me up and he could ask me all the questions about cheating. I figured then I could prove to my husband that I didn’t do even 1 of the things he had accused me of for the past two years. 

The producers wrote me back and called me back and after about a month of going back and forth with collecting additional info, they officially invited us to be on the show. 

Both my husband and I were thrilled thinking that this would be a fresh start for us. For the first time in a long time, I had some tangible hope that things could and would only get better from here. This emotional torment might finally end. I was exhausted, but elated at the opportunity. We both were. 

But a week before we were supposed to board our plans for the show, my husband said he refused to participate if the lie detector guy was going to be there. I didn’t get it because that woulda been a great way to know for sure that I didn’t cheat or text or call or email any guy ever. But something about the lie detector test made him get cold feet. Then he just said no, he changed his mind and wouldn’t be going to the show. 
So that was it for me. That night I told him to pack his bags and get lost. I filed for divorce the next morning. 

So now, I have this awesome guy who I’ve been with for 6 years and just married. Well recently, he thought it would be a great idea to get life 360 on our phones.  I know a lot of couples use that and find it even helpful at times. He argues that it’s great for emergencies or to know if I got forced into a double shift at work. (I can’t bring my phone on the floor with me; it has to stay in the work locker) so with life 360, even if I cannot text him to tell him I got forced onto a double, he can just log into 360 and confirm this for himself. 

   I told him I’d do it on a trial basis, but that I find it very creepy. And I still have it on but I just have an unsettling knot in the pit of my stomach ever since. I feel a little less excited about being married to him now. I know it’s probably just some left over trauma from what I dealt with from my ex, but I just feel like it’s just a matter of time before I’m being questioned about things. He has a very sedentary, very boring position in his company. He basically sits there watching YouTube all day. So I know for a fact he is sitting there watching my car drive to work, the grocery store or wherever. And I know in his case, it’s probably out of extreme boredom. But it doesn’t change the fact that I am on the receiving end of it. I have zero privacy. Every place I might happen to stop at, I could be subject to an interrogation over. And I know that a lot of people are of the belief that if you aren’t up to anything shady, then you have nothing to hide. But bring on the butt end of that for so many years, I know how crappy it feels to be interrogated when you did nothing wrong to deserve the interrogation. If I have done nothing except for being a loving, loyal, hard working, responsible, faithful wife, then I shouldn’t have to be tracked and I did nothing to justify losing basic privacies that everyone is entitled to without having to explain every move you make. 

I dunno. I’ll be amazed if anyone made it this far. I know I can get carried away, but I was just hoping to glean some perspective/opinions. Do you guys like being gps tracked like a disobedient teenager who’s got a curfew to abide by? 
I just feel so discouraged already. 

It makes me just want to throw away my phone. I know if I tell him that I hate the app, he’s gonna piss and moan about it because bottom line, he just wants to track me. His ex cheated on him so deep down, I think it gives him some peace of mind to know exactly where I am. But unfortunately, I was with a guy who constantly accused me of doing something evil… that I was 100% innocent of. ",0,1751775887.0,relationship_advice,7,0.5,False

1lssiqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lssiqi/my_gerd_journey_how_i_found_my_ultimate_trigger/,"My GERD Journey, how I found my ultimate trigger, and how my dentist may have inadvertently caused my esophageal erosion","Hi everybody,

I have been a GERD sufferer since February 2024, and while I'm relatively new to the club it's been a miserable time. About a month ago though, I was finally able to put the biggest piece of my GERD trigger puzzle together so I wanted to share a bit about my journey and my triggers in hopes that it might help someone.

A little background, I'm a 35 year old white male with a BMI of 31. Prior to my GERD diagnosis I was a spicy food, black coffee, and sparkling water king. I would go through a case of sparkling water a week, if not more.

Everything started in January of 2024 when I changed insurance plans and started seeing a new dentist. My new dentist recommended I purchase a mouth guard to prevent my teeth from grinding at night. He also recommended I start using a fluoride mouthwash after brushing my teeth to help prevent tooth decay. Every night after that I would floss with mint coated floss, brush my teeth with mint toothpaste, and rinse with a mint fluoride mouthwash (Tom's Brand), then place my night guard in. I believe this is what ultimately caused my GERD (Obviously mint is a big trigger for me, but there's a little more to it so skip to the TL;DR for the quick explanation).

Sometime in February I began to notice some pain on ONLY the right side of my throat up through my jaw. I went to my Primary Care Physician and he looked in my throat and noticed some swelling and recommended a large dose of dexamethasone to try to clear it up. It didn't help, so he moved to antiobiotics. They didn't help either. By now it was March and I was desperate. Every day the right side of my throat/jaw was in immense pain and I was beginning to get ear pain as well. My PCP, to his credit, suggested it might be silent reflux (because I wasn't getting traditional heartburn symptoms) but by now I was convinced it was something more nefarious and begged for a referral to an ENT (I was convinced I had throat cancer or something). Up to that point I naively thought ""I've experienced heartburn before, and this is absolutely NOT heartburn, it hurts too much"". I was so mad at my PCP because I felt like I was being medically gaslit, so I turned down a script for Omeprazole and decided to tough it out till I saw a specialist.

Unfortunately my city and the surrounding areas has a two month wait to see an ENT, so I suffered for two months with this GERD pain. I considered going to the hospital several times, and came close at least twice, but my doctor was adamant that it wasn't throat cancer based on the symptoms so I decided I could wait 2 months rather than take on a huge and unnecessary medical bill.

By this point I was beginning to suspect that the mouth guard had something to do with the throat pain. The mouth guard prevented my mouth from closing at night leading to dry mouth and a dry throat in the morning, so I stopped using it. My symptoms did improve slightly, but I continued using mint toothpaste and mint mouthwash at night.

I finally saw an ENT in May who diagnosed me with GERD and prescribed me a 90 day supply of Esomeprazole Magnesium 40 mg. I quit coffee cold turkey, quit eating spicy foods, and quit drinking sparkling water. It took longer than I expected, but around day 70 I was starting to finally feel pain free. After 90 days I transitioned to Pepcid AC for about a week before finally being mostly free from my GERD. As long as I avoided coffee, super spicy foods, and carbonated beverages, I could pretty much eat whatever I wanted. I even continued to use my mint mouthwash, floss, and toothpaste, but happened to randomly switch to doing that routine only in the morning.

Flash forward to March 2025 - I start seeing a new dentist (PS Dental insurance is stupid) and he tells me that brushing in the morning is not as important as brushing at night and also recommends I go back to using mouth wash at night to help prevent tooth decay. He recommends I try Therabreath Sparkle Mint Fluoride Mouthwash, so I do, and low and behold by mid March my GERD is back and I'm in an immense amount of pain. I call my PCP who sends in an order for Esomeprazole Magnesium 40mg, but after 30 days it hasn't even made a dent. At this point I'm in a full blown panic and I haven't connected the dots about mint. All I can think is that despite my diet consisting of traditionally non-triggering foods this is somehow happening again and it's worse even with a PPI. After scouring this subreddit I ask my doctor to switch PPIs for me and he puts me on 20mg of Pantoprazole. I also learn from this subreddit that mint is a major trigger so I stop using my mouthwash and switch to Bubble Gum toothpaste. Unfortunately nothing really changed for 30 days. I finally ask my doc to try a different PPI again, so he puts me on Omeprazole and that has been seeming to do the trick. I'm only 26 days into Omeprazole so I'm hopeful that after a full 90 day course I can come off of it again.

TL;DR: My hypothesis is that ultimately my mouth guard prevented my mouth from closing at night, leading to dry mouth and a dry throat. Then the mint mouthwash would settle into the mouth guard and crevices in my mouth and slowly trickle down my throat while laying down at night. The mint triggered my GERD and the acid came up at night and settled onto the right side of my BONE DRY throat because I sleep on my right side at night. I can confirm that Mint is a major trigger for me and Pantoprazole does not work for me as well as Omeprazole does.

Anyway, I hope this will help someone! Happy to answer any questions, and please stop using mint mouthwash and night guards!
