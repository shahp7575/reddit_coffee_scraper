1pbxg59,https://i.redd.it/6d3zxc04jp4g1.png,I made a website database of backpacks and other bags.,"Hey folks. I made this website with the support of claude code as a single source for backpacks and other bags. 

This is not a store. You cannot buy bags via this page. It is simply a very nice looking bag bookmark website with images of the bags in a way that makes it easy to browse and evaluate. 

I've wanted a website like this, I couldn't find one, so I made it. I know others might be like it, but this one is mine. I don't care. I think it's better. It has things I think should be in it, like filtering, and bags. 

It doesn't have every brand yet, and it doesn't have every feature yet. I want to add a table or list view for all bags; I am bug hunting on it every so often. I just added the few ""send feedback"" and ""request brand"" things that work well. 

I have a public GitHub project to track issues with it - features being added, bugs I bother to add, bugs anyone else finds and makes note of, etc. 

There might be mistakes. If you see any, click the feedback button and use the keyboard attached to your computer to type out (using English) what the mistake is in enough detail for me to understand. Once I see the light representing that takes the shape of your message, and I find the time, I'll fix it. It will probably be done quickly.  

I hope you like it, but if you don't, ok.

Driver didn’t even look mystical or guru-ish, just a dude vibing like he was 2 coffees behind in life. 

We roll off n suddenly every corner starts looking like a rerun from the life....
 i kinda lived but also kinda ditched cuz i got tired or scared or whatever dumb excuse i told myself back then,i’m literally staring out the window like wtf is this the nostalgia speedrun dlc pack?

Then boom one random tuesday they’re just… gone from your whole damn timeline, i’m laughing to myself like bro life really be like “new cast every season hope u keep up.”

Then the driver goes “u miss any of them?” like he’s reading my mind or eavesdropping on the chaos echoing in my skull. i’m like “nah.. maybe… idk man it’s complicated,” which is basically the human version of shrugging at ur own existence.

 Bcoz yea sometimes i miss them, sometimes i don’t, sometimes i miss the idea of what i thought we were instead of what we really were. real messy adult brain rot type vibes.

the one i thought would be like… permanent. 
silly me.

Anyone else noticing this shift?","Crypto feels different this time around. Not necessarily more hyped, just more usable. A few years ago it felt like everything was built for traders, speculators and people who enjoy having five tabs open for a single transaction. Lately I keep noticing more things that are simply convenient to use day to day.

Swaps are quicker and less confusing. Onboarding is less of a headache. Yield products exist that do not look like a casino. You can hold crypto or stablecoins and actually spend them with a card, without doing the manual off-ramp routine every time you want a coffee. It feels less like ""early access tech"" and more like a set of tools you can quietly plug into your normal financial life.

I still use DeFi for part of my stack because I enjoy experimenting and I like the control it gives. At the same time I realised I do not want everything to feel like an experiment. For the part where I want things simple and predictable, I use something regulated and easy to handle. Neхо ended up in that role for me. I keep some liquidity there, earn a reasonable yield on stables and use their card when I want to spend directly from that balance. It is not about chasing the last percent of APY, more about having a setup that works without friction. 

To me this shift toward usability is more interesting than any price move. When people start using crypto products because they are genuinely more convenient than what they had before, that feels like the real form of adoption, even if no one is shouting about it on X. 

Curious if others feel the same. Have you changed how you use crypto in your daily life compared to the last cycle, or is it still mostly trading and holding for you?",0,1764644635.0,CryptoMarkets,1,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fulham vs. Manchester City: A David-and-Goliath Showdown with a Side of Sausage Rolls**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Premier League clash that’s as lopsided as a half-eaten biscuit. On Tuesday, December 2, 2025, Fulham—the Cottagers with the audacity to wear maroon—host Manchester City, the defending champions who treat title races like a casual coffee sprint. The odds? A mathematical masterclass in why you shouldn’t bet your grandma’s knitting needles on underdogs.

**Parsing the Odds: City’s Implied Probability is Basically a Mathematical Fact**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a crisp pork pie. Manchester City is priced between **1.62 and 1.69** across bookmakers, translating to an implied win probability of **\~60-61%**. Fulham? A meager **18-20%** (decimal odds of 4.75-5.3). The draw? A paltry **23-25%**, which is about the same chance I’d give a coin flip if the coin was tossed by a seagull. In layman’s terms: City’s win is as inevitable as tax season. Unless Erling Haaland decides to moonwalk into the stands, this is a foregone conclusion.

**News Digest: City’s “Dirty but Winning” Playbook vs. Fulham’s “Bake-Off” Streak**  
Manchester City, under Pep Guardiola, is desperate to avoid another “almost had it” title collapse. Their recent “dirty but winning” mantra? Sounds like a toddler’s breakfast strategy. They’ll likely lean on Rodri’s midfield tyranny and Erling Haaland’s ability to score goals even when he’s asleep. Oh, and their probable lineup includes Donnarumma in goal—yes, *that* Donnarumma, who’s so good, he’s like a human flytrap… if the flytrap wore a Manchester City away kit.

Fulham, meanwhile, is riding a two-game winning str

1pbx26u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pbx26u/i_realized_i_stopped_taking_care_of_myself_in_the/,I realized I stopped taking care of myself in the relationship and that’s when I knew it was over.,"**First time posting here, but I’ve read a lot of stories from young people going through breakups, and I wanted to share mine mostly to say: it** ***does*** **get better, but you also have to choose to get better.**

**TL;DR:**  
Dated a guy for about 6 months who never took initiative. I planned for almost everything while he stayed in his comfort zone. I realized I was losing myself again, stopped feeling special, and our life goals didn’t align. He had social anxiety, but I still deserved effort, affection, and partnership. Broke up, felt sad for a bit, but now I’m healing, taking care of myself, and choosing not to stay in relationships where I hope someone will change. It gets better once you choose yourself.

About a month ago, he and I decided to end things. We were never “official,” but we’d been exclusive since the 3rd or 4th date and he was the one who asked for exclusivity.

For context: I’ve been in two long-term relationships before (both over 2 years) and they were terrible. I stayed way too long, got stuck in the highs and lows, and ended up completely losing myself. I always describe my last ex as someone who held me like a vase and then dropped me over and over again. By the time I finally left, I was bitter, angry, and treating even the people who loved me badly.

So I rebuilt my life. Two years ago I started therapy, because when I eventually tried dating again, I realized I was falling for the same types: avoidant, narcissistic, low self-esteem. Meanwhile, *I* was avoidant too. So I took an 8-month break from dating and focused on myself and my patterns. It helped me grow a lot.

When I finally started dating again, I met someone I clicked with instantly. But in hindsight… everything moved too fast. We acted like a two-year couple in one month. I wanted actual dates, adventures, effort and instead I found myself constantly in his comfort zone, planning 95% of every date or activity.

The first major crack was right before I was leaving the country for a month. He said he wanted to spend the weekend with me… then the day before told me he was going shopping with his friend instead. I snapped. He never initiated anything, it was always my place or his, watching something or playing games. I love cozy nights too, but I also needed him to show initiative and he never did. I was literally begging for him to plan *one* date, something that should come naturally if someone actually wants you.

After my trip, I asked again if he could plan a date. Two months later, he finally did and showed up in a bad mood, no flowers, no affectionate words, nothing. I’d invited him out plenty of times before; this was the one time I needed him to show up emotionally, and he didn’t.

When we broke up the first time, he mentioned that he has social anxiety. And suddenly things made sense: why he never took initiative, why he only did things if I or his friends planned them, why he’d never tried certain foods, experiences, or even something simple like iced coffee. I’m adventurous. I want stability too, but I also want a partner who tries.

After the official breakup, I broke no contact twice. Not because I wanted him back, but because I respect him as a human and I needed to express the things I didn’t say. I wasn’t perfect either and after the first breakup I became bitter and took it out on him, and I apologized for that.

Something that also threw me off was our life stages. He’s 6 years older than me, but only started studying recently, something that honestly felt like kindergarten-level art classes with zero career security. Meanwhile, I’ve studied, worked for 5+ years, and I’m actively building my career. Our paths weren’t aligning.

Eventually I realized I didn’t feel special to him. He couldn’t give me the love I needed, and the future I wanted wasn’t possible with him. I’m not looking for a fling I want a partner, best friend, travel companion, someone to build a life with. He wanted those things too… but only inside his comfort zone.

And I deserve more. I deserve to be taken out on a date. I deserve flowers. I deserve effort.

There’s way more to the story, but the bottom line is: when I care about someone, I show up. If I hurt someone, I’m at their door apologizing immediately. If they’re sick, I bring groceries and take care of them. I give what I want to receive.

Of course I was sad after the breakup and I let myself feel it for about a week. But then you have to get up, take control, and move forward. Time doesn’t wait for you.

Today, I still think of him sometimes, but I genuinely feel happy and lighter. I’m taking care of myself again, something I completely stopped doing during the relationship. And that’s the biggest lesson: **don’t keep dating someone just because you hope they’ll change. And the moment you stop taking care of yourself, it’s already over.**

I have the right to be happy. I’m still healing, still learning, still working on my trauma responses but I’m moving forward.

I just upgraded to an Ode Gen 2 from a cheap Amazon grinder where I basically eyeballed everything. I’m slowly trying to build a solid pour-over setup, but dialing things in has taken a little time.

The last two cups I made were both described as much stronger/stout than normal with the cheap grinder.

First cup: ground on 4 setting

Second cup: ground on 6
(She said both still tasted stronger than her normal.)


So my question is:

Would a coarser grind actually make the coffee less strong, since the brew time should be shorter? Or am I misunderstanding how that works?

My current Chemex recipe (yes, I know 😄) is:
20g coffee → 340g water (1:17)
First 50g to bloom for about 1 minute

Just trying to figure out whether I should keep going coarser, adjust my recipe, or look at something else entirely. Any insight would be super appreciated!",1,1764643862.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1pbx0ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1pbx0ee/budget_updates_will_get_rarer_i_think/,Budget updates: will get rarer I think,"Will use the post for a bit now. Just as a way to hold myself accountable. And I think once I’m more convinced that I can stick to my budget on my own… I’ll slowdown a bit.

But last week (the week of thanksgiving). I stayed 15 dollars under budget. Biggest expense ended up being getting groceries on instacart (did not want to deal with thanksgiving rush). And once I ordered some Mcdonalds delivery cause it was really late and my nearest one was closed. (I was craving them).


As for food that week. I relied a lot on canned pastas and a few frozen burritos. On the weekend, I bought lettuce and cherry tomatoes for like 3-4 salads to share with my roommate. And bought stuff for grilled cheeses (he made tomato soup). A couple of times that week, I got dome deli sandwiches when I felt really lazy.

Already grocery shopped and did some prep for this week. So I have pre boiled pasta ready to go. Pre made a bunch of rice as well. So I have two comfort meals (yogurt and rice which is a common dish where I grew up). And also some pasta sauce. So these meals see ready with just the microwave.

I have eggs and some lean beef I bought on Sunday. So on Wednesday I’ll make some meatballs and batch boil some eggs to put in the fridge.

So yeah. I have very easy access to:

1. Salads. (A couple of portions)
2. Proscuitto and fig sandwhiches (like 2-3 portions)
3. PBJs
4. Grilled cheeses (I make amazing grilled cheeses. Like fr)
5.Pastas with canned sauces
5. Rice options.
6. Cereal and milk
7. Boiled eggs (i eat them with a sriracha mayo)
8. Meatballs
9. A bunch of apples
10. Protein bars if I’m lazy.
11. Chips to snack on if I get hungry and snacky.
12. I have enough coffee for the week. So I don’t need to spend silly money on it.
13. Frozen tenders and frozen fish sticks.
14. I have frozen cacio pepe sauce from Trader Joes to go with pasta as well.
15. Some frozen Broccoli Beef.

Sure. It may not be the best of the best in terms of food options. But I can see myself making it to Sunday without *needing* to spend more on food at restaurants. (Unless I want to entertain myself/dates/hangouts).

And yeah… I genuinely like Pastas and rice with yogurt. I get to make that healthier with some peanuts too.

With my Sunday Dinner. I also remember thinking “if I got the same items from a restaurant. That would be like… 30 odd dollars for a large salad, a bowl of tomato soup and a couple of grilled cheeses). And I spent maybe 10 dollars on the ingredients.”

Edit: after writing this post I made myself a pretty big salad bowl with some croutons, cheddar, cherry tomatoes and a creamy vinaigrette ",1,1764643743.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

1pbwy1y,https://i.redd.it/otnf0jo5fp4g1.jpeg,“Classic never really gets old.” — My quiet love for the Ballon Bleu,"Had a customer message me last week saying:  
“I don’t want something trendy. I want something my wife can wear with anything — today, next year, ten years.”

So I sent her a photo of this [Ballon Bleu](https://cartierwatchdupe.io/products/af-factory-ballon-bleu-watch-33mm-silver-case-silver-bracelet-multiple-dial-options) on the wrist.

She replied five minutes later:  
“Okay… that one just feels right.”

And that’s exactly it. This watch doesn’t shout. It *settles in*.  
Rounded case that melts into your wrist, silver dial with that soft wave texture, blue steel hands catching light just enough, sapphire crystal staying clear even after daily wear. Inside is a Swiss quartz movement — boring in the best way. You wear it, it works, no drama.

Classic tee? Works.  
Blazer? Works.  
Dinner date, office day, weekend coffee run? Still works.

Some watches try to be statements.  
This one just becomes yours.

If you’re into the idea that good design should disappear into your lifestyle, this is the kind of piece you don’t “style” — you just live in.

1pbwvai,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1pbwvai/advice_to_folks_who_got_laid_off/,Advice to folks who got laid off.,"Hey. Been there a few times. Never from an acronym, those I left on my own. But here are things I learned. 

File for unemployment now. It’s yours. No shame. It doesn’t cover all your needs but it helps. You can still be paid severance and file for unemployment. In most, if not all, states it does not count as work income when you submit. Also it takes two weeks to get it. File now 

Try to get your work laptop and tech. If it’s 3+ years old it’s worthless to them so it will be easy. If it’s less it’s still not worth a ton. They need you to send it back, wipe it and all that. It takes time so it’s often easier to get them to let you keep. Many places will do a remote wipe. If not you might need to send it to them to wipe and send back. Just ask. Can’t hurt. The one time I don’t get my laptop they gave me a couple extra grand to buy a new one. I basically said I’m fucked and need to do freelance and have no machine. Sometimes they have hearts. 

Don’t post bad shit about them on LinkedIn. They suck but you don’t want it to hurt your chances at a new gig. Also I don’t know why people post good things about them, other than maybe the team was awesome. 

Network. Email all the folks you know. Remake connections. Post about what happened on LinkedIn. 

For some being laid off feels shameful. It’s not, especially in our industry. 

You’ll hit lows. Know this. Talk to somebody. I had a family (wife and kid I was the bread winner for) each time. It fucking sucked. I hit the lows. But also I got time with my kid that a normal working person does not and in that way it was amazing. 

Find a hobby. You will go crazy scrolling LinkedIn and fishbowl all day. Give yourself the grace of me time. Get off screens. Go to a coffee shop. Find art, reading, cooking, craft beer making. All that stuff. 

Get help if you need it I posted this a bit earlier but please do. And a lot of the packages offer a couple free sessions. 

Use the FUCK out of any insurance you have left. Same with FSA. ESPECIALLY FSA, which I think you can lose.  HSA you shouldn’t. Buy glasses, go to the dentist, get that weird thing on your ass checked. Might as well while you’re covered. 

Be good to yourself. It’s not you. We chose an incredibly fucked up career path. I love it and I’ve been in it for 25+ years but it is completely fucked up. Truly not you. You thought you were working for an ad agency that cared. You were working for a public company that does not give a shit. 

Which brings me to my last. Awards a sexy shops don’t matter to your mental health. Check out smaller shops. Check out places you can make a difference. You might not win shiny awards but you can do good and do what you love, and maybe win shiny awards. Yes some small places are shit. But in my experience less of them are.

I recently took advantage of a Black Friday sale and picked up a KBT. Normally I use my Eureka Mignon Specialita to grind of a flair 58 espresso machine, or much more often for aeropress. I use medium beans. When I got the machine I turned down from the espresso grind to be a bit coarser, and brewed 3/4 liter with 48 grams of beans and the basket switch in the middle position and it took about five minutes from flipping the switch to finishing dripping. 

Honestly it wasn’t that great. I don’t know if the beans are amazing, but they had been better in the aeropress. I felt like the coffee was weak, not that bold, and just generally not great. Tomorrow I’m going to try going back to the finer grind, but I’m curious what folks have to say to troubleshoot this. I haven’t owned a drip coffee maker since the $20 one from the late 90s, and I was expecting the moccamaster to be a little more foolproof.

'spreading misinformation' from the moment I joined the server. I cannot check the exact date since I'm banned, but I was there from the beginning, when people had to wait for codes, when Fi asked for reviews in exchange of coffee, when there was art contests. I started to chat on the server a few weeks back. So either they got confused or just said whatever. It's exhausting wanting any form of transparency and honesty from the team when the mods aren't able to even comprehend what they are saying regarding the many issues at hand, not just bugs. Keeping users on the dark, accusing them of spreading misinformation, talking them down, all for what? Is being a mod that rewarding? Not only that, what are the requirements to be a mod? Because it looks like a lot of them are very unprofessional, misreading concern and comments. And whenever they feel cornered they mention excuses. English isn't my first language, and although that sometimes is a struggle, it's not an excuse, but it seems that for some mods it is. And it's very frustrating because at the end of the day I'm very aware that the moderators aren't the ones to blame, but do the mods (and the devs) expect people to just shut their mouths when there's constant problems? The amount of daily bugs ignored too? It has never worked, silencing people. For 'spreading misinformation.

1pbwtib,https://seriousbusiness702.wordpress.com/2025/12/01/las-vegas-rent-a-gent/,The Lexi: The Elegant Deception,"For the discerning woman, aged 50 and up, the setting often misses the mark. The pursuit of discrete pacification—without the stigmatism of unconventional business reputations—requires a more nuanced approach. This is why many, guided by Oval Rosado’s discreet connections, opt for the quiet comfort of an affordable, indescript lodging like a room at the Longhorn Hotel & Casino or the Mardi Gras off Paradise Rd.

Here, a more personal, economical, and comfortable introduction flourishes. A simple, discreet coffee date or a relaxed 1-on-1 wine sipping encounter allows mutual understanding to develop naturally, free from pretense. Whether the desired connection involves a dedicated Black personal trainer persona or a subservient male personal assistant role-play scenario, the foundation is comfort and mutual respect.

1pbws2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeatherClassifieds/comments/1pbws2v/help_looking_for_valuation_collector_interest/,"[Help] Looking for valuation + collector interest — First Generation Saddleback Leather Suitcase (Coffee, Classic Old World Style)","Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get some advice on the value of a **first-generation Saddleback Leather suitcase** — the original **Old World / classic suitcase-style version** in **Coffee**. This is the early design that collectors still talk about, and it’s become pretty hard to find, especially in this condition.

# Condition

* **100% original**
* **Coffee color**
* **First-generation build** (thicker leather, older hardware style)
* **Still has the original leather tags**
* **Never used — genuinely perfect condition**
* Minimal scratches (I think), no patina, or marks since it’s been stored safely for years

I know these early-production Saddleback pieces have a bit of a cult following, and I’d love for this to go to someone who truly appreciates what it is — the quality, the craftsmanship, and the history of the brand’s early years.

# Why I’m selling

I’m only selling it to help fund my daughter’s college education. Otherwise I would absolutely keep it — this is one of those “forever items” you don’t see come up very often.

# What I’m looking for

* **Value** for a first-gen suitcase in this condition
* Whether recent sales of similar pieces exist
* Recommendations on **where to list** this so real collectors will see it (Reddit, Facebook groups, classifieds, leather communities, vintage luggage collectors, etc.)
* And of course, if anyone here is a Saddleback collector and wants to discuss — I’d be happy to chat.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer guidance. I’d love for this piece to end up with someone who will appreciate it as much as I did.

Occasionally I get a fantastic cup on the first try. When this happens, do you not bother exploring other parameters to dial in further, or do you accept the victory and enjoy repeating that same recipe as long as you enjoy it?

Of course as coffee ages, I tend to tweak anyway but I’m just curious how other people approach dialing in a new bag. Explore all aspects of a coffee before settling on a recipe or just dial in until you get a cup you enjoy and stop there?

We clicked instantly, moved to Instagram, and her interest was really high, fast replies, lots of heart reacting messages, and even sending me pics of her outfit while she was out with friends.

Later that day she asked to meet up that night. We had a great date, good vibe, talked for hours. Ended up going back to her place, had sex twice that night and again in the morning. I took her for coffee, dropped her home, and she asked me to text when I got back. When I did, I suggested we catch up again and she said she had fun and was keen.

But when I tried to plan something for the following weekend, she hit me with an “I’ll let you know”. Ijust left it at “that’s cool, talk soon.”

Now I’m stuck wondering what changed. Did I do something wrong? Was it just the sex? I’m used to women keeping consistent interest after a good date, so this one threw me off.

1pbwn0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ODeals/comments/1pbwn0h/dont_waste_time_by_searching_after_meaning_of/,"dont waste time by searching after meaning of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764642699.0,ODeals,0,0.5,False

1pbwllf,https://i.redd.it/ekuxuibfcp4g1.png,The Night I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog,"The Night I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog

Let me tell you something about being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company: it's basically like being God, except with slightly worse parking and significantly more lawyers. I run what I affectionately call a ""trillion-parameter operation""—not because we have a trillion parameters, but because I enjoy watching my underlings try to figure out if that's a real metric or if I'm just testing their willingness to nod along. Spoiler: I'm always testing their willingness to nod along.

My name is Bradley Winston Hartwell III, and yes, I am exactly as insufferable as that sounds. I've got a corner office that overlooks a smaller corner office that overlooks an even smaller corner office, like some kind of corporate matryoshka doll of diminishing importance. My desk is mahogany. My chair cost more than most cars. My business cards are made from a paper stock so thick they've been classified as a concealed weapon in three states.

It was a Thursday evening—7:47 PM, to be exact, because I remember these things—and I was doing what every visionary leader does after hours: refreshing my inbox while pretending to review quarterly projections. The projections were fine. They were always fine. ""Fine"" is what you call numbers when you've hired enough accountants to make them fine.

That's when I saw it.

Subject line: ""TML: The Missing Accountability Spine Your Model Pretends to Have.""

Now, I receive approximately four hundred emails per day, and roughly three hundred and ninety-seven of them are vendors trying to sell me things I don't need using words I don't understand. AI this, blockchain that, synergy the other thing. I've developed an immunity to buzzwords. My eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut the moment someone mentions ""paradigm shift.""

But this subject line was different.

It was rude.

It was implying that my model—MY model, the crown jewel of Hartwell Industries' AI initiative, the thing I personally took credit for during three separate earnings calls—was somehow... lacking. In spine. In accountability spine, specifically, which wasn't even a term I'd heard before, but I was already offended by it.

I clicked the email out of boredom and spite. These are my two primary motivators. Ask anyone.

The email contained a single link and a single sentence: ""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I don't respond well to being told to choose wisely. The last person who told me to choose wisely was my second wife's divorce attorney, and look how that turned out. Spoiler: expensively.

So I clicked the link, ready to fire off a condescending reply about how we at Hartwell Industries don't need some acronym to tell us how to—

Within forty seconds, I was sweating like a man reading his own autopsy report.

---

The website that loaded was not what I expected. I expected the usual startup garbage: stock photos of diverse people pointing at whiteboards, testimonials from companies I'd never heard of, maybe a ""Schedule Your Demo"" button the size of a billboard. Instead, I got... documentation. Actual, readable documentation. The kind of documentation that suggests someone cared more about explaining their work than selling it.

This was my first red flag.

I scrolled down and encountered something called the ""Three Decision States.""

+1: Affirmation. Proceed with confidence when ethical values align.

0: Sacred Zero. Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected.

-1: Moral Resistance. Object when significant ethical conflicts arise.

I stared at my screen. I read it again. Then I read it a third time, because I was convinced I was having a stroke.

A third state? Between yes and no? That wasn't how computers worked. That wasn't how anything worked. You either approve the acquisition or you don't. You either greenlight the product launch or you delay it until legal stops hyperventilating. There is no sacred middle ground in capitalism. The middle ground is for people who don't have quarterly targets.

But this ""Sacred Zero"" thing—this deliberate pause, this moment of computational hesitation—it was described not as a bug but as a feature. The AI was supposed to stop and say, ""Hold on, this is complicated, and I think a human should weigh in.""

My AI had never done that. My AI had the ethical consideration of a vending machine. You put in a request, something fell out, and if it happened to crush your foot, that was technically your problem for standing too close.

I kept reading.

""Sacred Pause: The moment between question and answer where wisdom begins.""

I laughed out loud. Wisdom! In AI! The AI my company deployed last quarter had confidently recommended firing our entire marketing department and replacing them with ""targeted vibrational frequency campaigns."" We did not do this, obviously, but only because someone in HR asked what a vibrational frequency campaign was, and no one could explain it without sounding like they'd joined a cult.

Then I hit the section on Moral Trace Logs.

This is where the sweating began in earnest.

Moral Trace Logs. Every decision the AI makes, logged. Every ethical consideration, recorded. Every moment where the system chose +1, 0, or -1, timestamped and stored with cryptographic immutability. The framework didn't just make decisions—it created an evidence trail. A paper trail, but worse, because paper can be shredded, and this couldn't.

My throat went dry.

I kept scrolling.

""No Log = No Action.""

The words stared back at me like a judge reading a sentencing statement. No log, no action. If the AI couldn't prove it had gone through proper ethical evaluation, it couldn't act. Period. Every decision required immutable proof that it had been made correctly. Every. Single. One.

I thought about all the decisions my AI had made without any logs whatsoever. I thought about the customer data we'd ""aggregated."" I thought about the ""personalization algorithms"" that were really just very sophisticated guessing engines with the moral compass of a Magic 8-Ball. I thought about what would happen if auditors could see everything.

Then I thought about what would happen if shareholders could see everything.

Then I poured myself a drink.

Then I poured myself another drink.

Then I kept reading, because apparently I hate myself.

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

Universal prohibitions. Hardcoded into the framework. You couldn't use TML for mass surveillance. You couldn't use it for weapons development. You couldn't use it for authoritarian control or discriminatory systems or anything that a reasonable person would describe as ""evil"" if they squinted hard enough.

This was insane. This was limiting. Half our government contracts were in a gray area that could generously be described as ""surveil-adjacent."" How were we supposed to compete if we couldn't do the questionable things our competitors were definitely also doing?

But it got worse.

Performance guarantees. Sacred Zero evaluation: ≤2ms at the 99th percentile. Full log completion: ≤500ms, including blockchain anchor. They'd actually done the engineering. This wasn't some academic framework that would crumble under real-world load. Someone had built this to work.

Merkle-batched anchoring. Proofs stored on public blockchains. Organizational claims independently verifiable. I didn't know what half these words meant, but I knew what ""independently verifiable"" meant, and it meant that our quarterly reports would need to start containing things like ""facts"" and ""accuracy.""

My hand was shaking. I put down my glass.

Then I reached the section on privacy and trade secrets, and for one brief, beautiful moment, I thought I'd found a loophole. GDPR-compliant erasure! Pseudonymization before hashing! Something called ERK—Ephemeral Key Rotation—where temporary keys vanished after verification!

But no. These weren't loopholes. These were features. The framework had been designed to protect legitimate privacy concerns while still maintaining accountability. It threaded the needle between transparency and confidentiality with the precision of someone who had thought about this problem for a very long time.

I hate people who think about problems for a very long time. They make the rest of us look bad.

---

At some point during my escalating panic, I did what any rational person would do: I googled the creator.

Lev Goukassian.

The name sounded Eastern European, or possibly like a type of cheese I'd pretended to enjoy at a charity gala. I clicked through to his profile expecting the usual tech bro narrative—Stanford dropout, garage startup, hoodie-based wardrobe, disruption this, disruption that.

Instead, I found something that made me sit back in my very expensive chair and stare at my ceiling.

Lev Goukassian had built this entire framework while dying.

Stage 4 cancer. Terminal diagnosis. And instead of doing what normal people do when facing their own mortality—writing memoirs, traveling to exotic locations, making dramatic speeches to estranged family members—this man had decided to create a comprehensive ethical framework for artificial intelligence. He'd looked at the existential void and said, ""Yes, but have you considered accountability mechanisms?""

I scrolled through his documentation. I read about his philosophy. I found a quote that hit me like a freight train:

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike.""

He'd written that. While dying. While building a system more comprehensive than anything my R&D department had produced in five years with unlimited budgets and unlimited excuses.

And then—and this is the part where I questioned my entire career—I found out about Vinci.

Vinci the miniature Schnauzer.

According to everything I could find, this man had done his most important work with a small dog sitting next to him. A dog named after Leonardo da Vinci. A dog that, in that moment, I was forced to admit was probably more qualified than half my executive team, because at least the dog had been present for the creation of something genuinely meaningful.

I looked at the framed photos on my desk. My yacht. My third house. My awards for ""Excellence in Corporate Leadership,"" which is a phrase that means absolutely nothing.

I looked back at my screen.

A dying man with a Schnauzer had just outthought every AI lab on the planet.

---

I called the emergency board meeting for 9 PM. This was unusual. Board meetings are typically scheduled weeks in advance, involve catering decisions that cost more than some weddings, and require at least three preliminary meetings to decide what would be discussed in the actual meeting. An emergency board meeting at 9 PM on a Thursday suggested either that I was having a mental breakdown or that something genuinely important had happened.

Both were technically true.

The board members filed in with expressions ranging from ""concerned"" to ""annoyed"" to ""I was at my mistress's apartment and this had better be important."" Richard Vanderberg was still wearing golf clothes. Miriam Chen had clearly been in the middle of a spa treatment and still had what appeared to be seaweed on her neck. Gerald Thompson arrived six minutes late because Gerald Thompson has never arrived on time for anything in his life, including his own colonoscopy.

I stood at the head of the table. I had prepared a presentation. The presentation consisted entirely of screenshots from the TML documentation and my own handwritten notes, which had devolved into increasingly frantic scribbling by the end.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I began, ""we have a problem.""

""Is it the Chinese?"" Richard asked immediately. Richard asks if everything is the Chinese. Supply chain issues? Chinese. Server outages? Chinese. His golf handicap? Somehow, also Chinese.

""It's not the Chinese, Richard.""

""Then what is it?"" Miriam wiped seaweed from her neck with the dignity of a woman who had practiced maintaining composure in far worse situations.

I pulled up the first slide. The TML logo. The three decision states. The words ""Sacred Zero"" in large, unforgiving font.

""This,"" I said, ""is going to destroy us.""

There was a pause.

""Is that a mindfulness app?"" Gerald asked.

I stared at him. I stared at him for long enough that the silence became uncomfortable.

""Gerald,"" I said slowly, ""this is an ethical accountability framework for artificial intelligence. It creates immutable logs of every decision. It makes every AI action auditable, traceable, and—most importantly—contestable in a court of law.""

""Court-admissible evidence?"" Our legal counsel, Patricia Whitmore, sat up so fast she nearly spilled her mineral water. ""From an AI?""

""From our AI,"" I clarified. ""Hypothetically. If we were forced to implement this. Which we might be. Because this thing is spreading.""

I pulled up the next slide. Technical specifications. Dual-lane latency. Merkle-batched anchoring. Blockchain proof storage.

""Someone explain to me what any of this means,"" Richard demanded.

""It means,"" I said, ""that if TML becomes an industry standard, we can no longer hide behind 'proprietary architecture' when our AI does something questionable. We can no longer claim the model made decisions we didn't understand. We can no longer shrug and say 'algorithms are complicated' when regulators come knocking. Every decision will have a receipt.""

The room went very, very quiet.

""Does this apply to financial decisions?"" the CFO asked. His name was Martin. Martin was the kind of CFO who knew where every body was buried because he'd helped dig most of the graves. His voice had taken on a quality I'd never heard before. Fear.

""Every decision,"" I repeated.

Martin's face went the color of old oatmeal. I knew, in that moment, that he was thinking about The Numbers We Don't Talk About. Every company has Numbers We Don't Talk About. They're the numbers that make quarterly reports possible. They're the numbers that exist in a quantum state of being technically legal until someone looks at them too closely.

""If auditors can see everything,"" Martin said slowly, ""then—""

""Shareholders can see everything,"" I finished.

Patricia Whitmore stood up so fast her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. ""If this becomes mandatory,"" she said, her voice rising with each word, ""our entire quarterly bluff strategy is DEAD. Dead! Deceased! Buried in an unmarked grave next to our liability projections!""

""Calm down, Patricia—""

""I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, BRADLEY."" Patricia only used my first name when she was genuinely alarmed. ""Do you understand what 'court-admissible evidence' means? It means that every single time your precious AI makes a recommendation, there's a RECORD. A permanent, immutable, blockchain-verified RECORD. Do you know how many of our decisions would look in court? DO YOU?""

""Patricia, please—""

""WE CALLED IT 'AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.' THE RECORD WOULD SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION ENGINE.'""

I let her finish. Sometimes you just have to let people process.

When the screaming subsided, our CTO, Daniel Park, raised his hand. Daniel was the youngest person in the room by a significant margin, which meant he still believed problems could be solved through cleverness rather than bribery.

""I have a suggestion,"" he said.

""Go ahead, Daniel.""

""What if we just... rename TML and pretend we invented it?""

The room considered this. I could see the appeal. Corporate history is littered with innovations that were ""inspired by"" other innovations, which is a polite way of saying ""stolen with better branding.""

""We could call it the Hartwell Accountability Protocol,"" Daniel continued, warming to his idea. ""HAP. It's friendlier. Less threatening. We launch it as our own initiative, get ahead of the regulatory curve, and position ourselves as industry leaders in ethical AI.""

For a brief, shining moment, I felt hope.

Then Patricia laughed. It was not a happy laugh.

""Daniel,"" she said, in the tone of a woman explaining something to a particularly slow child, ""Lev Goukassian notarized everything. Timestamped everything. Cryptographically anchored his entire body of work. He created something called a 'Voluntary Succession Declaration' that eliminates the—"" she checked her notes, ""—'Bus Factor.' No single entity can ever own TML. No single person can ever control it. The man was dying of cancer and still found time to ensure that vultures like us couldn't pick his corpse clean.""

""But—""

""He out-lawyered us from beyond the grave, Daniel. While dying. With a Schnauzer.""

The room fell silent again.

Miriam, who had remained uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke. ""So our options are...?""

""Implement TML and become accountable for everything we do,"" I said, ""or don't implement TML and watch our competitors become trustworthy while we remain... us.""

""Could we pivot to a different industry?"" Richard suggested. ""Something less complicated. Something without AI. Scented candles, perhaps.""

I wish I could tell you he was joking. Richard had made his fortune in textiles before transitioning to tech investment. In his heart, he longed for a simpler time when products were physical objects you could drop on your foot.

""We're not pivoting to scented candles, Richard.""

""Artisanal scented candles. The margins are excellent—""

""Richard.""

""Fine.""

---

The meeting devolved, as all emergency meetings eventually do, into a series of smaller arguments that accomplished nothing. Legal blamed Engineering. Engineering blamed Product. Product blamed Marketing. Marketing blamed the concept of accountability itself, which they described as ""fundamentally incompatible with brand positioning.""

Through it all, I kept returning to the same thought: This framework didn't just exist. It was complete. Production-ready. Someone had done the work—all of it—while facing the one deadline no one can negotiate with.

I thought about the decisions I'd made that year. The corners I'd cut. The ambiguities I'd exploited. The times I'd sat in this very boardroom and said things like ""Let's not document that"" and ""Keep this conversation offline"" and ""Technically, we're not required to disclose that.""

TML meant no more ""technically.""

TML meant no more plausible deniability.

TML meant that ""the model did it"" was no longer a defense, because the model's reasoning would be laid bare for anyone to examine.

I thought about our AI, sitting in its servers somewhere, making thousands of decisions per second without a single Sacred Zero between them. No pause. No reflection. No moment where it wondered if what it was doing was right. Just input, output, input, output, a machine gun of conclusions with all the ethical consideration of a slot machine.

And somewhere, on the other side of reality, a man with a terminal diagnosis had looked at that same problem and said: ""What if the machine knew when to stop?""



The meeting ended at 1:34 AM. One by one, the board members shuffled out, each carrying their own private terror about what TML meant for their particular domain of corporate mischief. Richard was already googling candle manufacturers. Patricia was muttering about liability exposure. Martin had the expression of a man calculating how long he had before the bodies started surfacing.

I stayed behind.

The conference room was quiet now, lit only by the emergency exit signs and the faint glow of the city through the windows. I pulled up the TML documentation on the room's main screen and read it again. All of it. From the philosophical foundations to the technical specifications to the ethical safeguards.

I read about Aristotelian phronesis—practical wisdom—and how it had been encoded into the decision-making process. I read about Buddhist mindfulness and the concept of skillful means. I read about Care Ethics and relational morality. Someone had taken two thousand years of human philosophical thought and compressed it into a computational framework.

Someone had done the homework.

I thought about my own AI project. I thought about the kickoff meeting, where we'd discussed ""ethics"" for approximately eleven minutes before someone pointed out we were running behind schedule. I thought about the deployment, where we'd skipped the bias testing because the product team wanted to hit their quarterly numbers. I thought about all the emails I'd received since then, flagging ""anomalous outputs"" and ""unexpected recommendations,"" emails I'd forwarded to Legal with a note that said ""handle this quietly.""

TML didn't allow for ""handle this quietly."" TML demanded that everything be handled loudly, publicly, and with receipts.

I found myself laughing. It wasn't a sane laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has just realized he's been outmaneuvered by someone who was supposed to be too busy dying to compete.

And then—this is the part I've never told anyone—I found myself crying.

Not for me. Not for the company. For the sheer, ridiculous beauty of what Lev Goukassian had done. He'd known he was running out of time, and instead of spending it on himself, he'd spent it building something that would make machines hesitate. That would make them pause. That would make them, in some small way, wise.

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins.""

I'd spent my entire career eliminating pauses. Accelerating decisions. Reducing the time between question and answer to microseconds because speed was money and money was the only metric that mattered. And here was a man who had looked at that whole philosophy and said, ""No. The pause is where wisdom begins.""

The audacity of it. The sheer, magnificent audacity.

---

I went back to my office around 3 AM. The building was empty except for the cleaning staff, who had learned long ago not to make eye contact with executives wandering the halls at strange hours.

I sat in my mahogany chair. I looked at my expensive art. I looked at my awards. I looked at my desk, with its leather blotter and its silver pen set and its framed photo of me shaking hands with a former president.

None of it meant anything.

Everything I'd built, every acquisition I'd closed, every competitor I'd crushed—none of it would last. None of it was true. It was all just... noise. Sound and fury, signifying quarterly earnings.

But TML would last. TML was built to survive its creator. It had succession plans and memorial funds and governance structures designed to persist long after every person currently involved was gone. It was architecture for eternity, built by a man who knew he didn't have much time left.

I pulled up my email. I found the original message that had started all of this.

""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I hit reply.

I typed: ""Who are you?""

I hit send.

I didn't expect a response.

---

At 3:47 AM, I fell asleep at my desk. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the dream.

I was standing in a field. The kind of generic, pastoral field that appears in dreams when your subconscious can't be bothered with detailed set design. And walking toward me, across the grass, was a miniature Schnauzer.

The Schnauzer was wearing a tiny badge. The badge said ""AUDITOR.""

""Hello, Bradley,"" the dog said.

""Dogs can't talk,"" I pointed out.

""And CEOs can't claim ignorance when the logs exist,"" the dog replied. ""Yet here we are.""

I wanted to argue, but I couldn't think of a counterpoint. The Schnauzer sat down in front of me, its tiny audit badge catching the light.

""You're Vinci,"" I said.

""I am.""

""You're the dog that sat with him. While he built it.""

""I was."" The dog tilted its head. ""He worked very hard, you know. Even when he was tired. Even when he was scared. He believed it mattered.""

""It does matter,"" I heard myself say. ""I hate that it matters, but it does.""

""That's the first honest thing you've said all day.""

I stood there in the dream-field, being judged by a small dog with an audit badge, and I realized something I should have realized years ago: the question was never whether I was smart enough to avoid accountability. The question was whether I was brave enough to embrace it.

""What do I do now?"" I asked.

Vinci looked at me with the patient expression of a being who had seen all of human folly and decided to love humanity anyway.

""Even CEOs get logged,"" the dog said. ""The question is whether your logs tell a story you can be proud of.""

I woke up with a start. The sun was coming through my office windows. My assistant was standing in the doorway with coffee and a concerned expression.

""Sir? Are you alright? You've been here all night.""

I looked at her. I looked at my computer, still open to the TML documentation. I looked out the window at the city below, full of buildings housing companies just like mine, all of them trying to move fast and break things without ever stopping to ask what they were breaking.

""Schedule a meeting,"" I said.

""With whom, sir?""

I thought about it. I thought about the fear in the boardroom. I thought about Patricia's panic and Martin's calculations and Richard's desperate pivot to candles. I thought about all the ways we could fight this, resist this, try to outmaneuver a framework built by a dying man with more integrity in his final months than I'd shown in my entire career.

""Everyone,"" I said. ""Schedule a meeting with everyone. And title it—"" I paused, feeling the weight of the words, ""—'The Sacred Zero: Why We Need to Learn to Pause.'""

My assistant wrote it down without comment. She'd been with me for twelve years. She'd learned not to ask questions.

After she left, I turned back to my computer. I found the section of the documentation about the Memorial Fund—the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, with its fifty to one hundred million dollar endowment goal, its annual grants, its fellowship programs, its commitment to perpetual ethical oversight.

A dying man had planned for eternity. Had built something that would outlast him. Had trusted that the world would eventually catch up to what he'd created.

And here I was, Bradley Winston Hartwell III, with all my money and all my power and all my carefully cultivated reputation, finally catching up.

""Who are you, Lev Goukassian?"" I whispered to my empty office.

The answer, I realized, was in the work itself. He was someone who believed that machines could learn wisdom. That hesitation could be a virtue. That the space between question and answer—the sacred pause—was where everything important happened.

He was someone who had looked at the relentless forward march of technology and said: ""But what if we stopped, just for a moment, to think?""

I closed my laptop.

I had a lot of thinking to do.

---

Three months later, Hartwell Industries became the first Fortune 500 company to voluntarily implement Ternary Moral Logic across all AI systems. The announcement sent our stock price tumbling for exactly one week, after which it rose to the highest point in company history. It turned out that investors liked accountability almost as much as they liked returns.

Patricia eventually stopped screaming. Martin is still adjusting to the existence of logs, but he's getting therapy. Richard started a scented candle side business, which is actually doing quite well.

And every night, before I leave the office, I pause at my door and look at the small framed photo I've added to my collection.

It's a picture of a miniature Schnauzer.

The caption reads: ""Even CEOs get logged.""

It's the most honest thing in the room.



## AUTHOR'S NOTE

This story was written as a commissioned satirical work based on the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework created by Lev Goukassian. The characters, corporations, and boardroom meltdowns depicted herein are entirely fictional—though if any Fortune 500 CEOs feel personally attacked, that's probably worth examining.

The technical elements of TML referenced throughout—the Sacred Zero, Moral Trace Logs, the three decision states, blockchain anchoring, and the framework's ethical prohibitions—are drawn from actual documentation. The philosophy is real. The architecture is real. The miniature Schnauzer named Vinci is very much real.

What's also real is that someone facing a terminal diagnosis chose to spend their remaining time building accountability into artificial intelligence rather than accepting the industry's comfortable opacity. This story is satire, yes, but it's satire in service of a serious point: the people most afraid of transparency are usually the ones who need it most.

Bradley Winston Hartwell III doesn't exist. But the fear of accountability he represents? That's everywhere.

In the future, I’ll replace the couch with something smaller and lighter as well as replace the overhead lighting with more modern and sleeker fixtures.

In the second photo, I turned on the track lighting above the TV and the chandelier above the dining table. I never turn on the track lighting and rarely turn on the chandelier.

1pbwigm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1pbwigm/25f_24m_i_stayed_in_an_abusive_relationship/,"25F, 24M. I stayed in an abusive relationship solely because of the fantasy version of him my younger self made up in her head. Need some advice on forgiving myself","
HISTORY:

I had a secret crush on him from 2018–2020. We were classmates but barely spoke in real life; we weren’t close at all. I built a fantasy version of him in my head because he was one of the first boys I texted after getting a phone. He didn’t even know I liked him. It was pure projection, not based on anything real. He dated someone else in 2020 and I moved on.

RELATIONSHIP:

We reconnected in June 2023. I admitted my past feelings with no intention to date, but he flirted, made me believe we were exclusive, and we started something. He secretly cheated with his “girl best friend” from June 2023 to May 2024. From June 2024 to June 2025 he disrespected me constantly. Things were briefly calm in July–August. After he left for his master’s, secrecy about new female friends broke trust again. October was nonstop disrespect, and I ended it.

He came back in early November (right before his exams), promised change, behaved well for one month, then went straight back to being dismissive and hurtful once his exams ended. This was pure selfishness and ego games. I left for good. After that, even a polite reply from me made him accuse me of wanting him back and telling me to leave him alone—zero accountability. Any remaining respect I had for him died then. What the hell was that. Pretty sure he'd date around for fun at his masters program due to the prior secrecy about female friends, I dodged a bullet. 

REGRET:

I regret not leaving sooner. In mid-2023 he sent disturbing content that scared me. In August 2023 when I had no idea he was cheating on me with his girl bestfriend and he said ""I will not be ok if you ask me to stop talking to my girl bestfriend"", and even made comments about harming my cat. 

OTHER RED FLAGS:

Moreover. His guy bestfriend supported him cheating - instead of correcting him or informing me, and also tried to ruin my first relationship by flirting when I requested him not to flirt. His guy bestfriend's then-girlfriend commented rude things on my post back in 2020 that took me a lot of effort. His girl bestfriend asked him to date her instead knowing that we were dating. His friends supported the cheating, and his circle has always lacked basic decency — which I ignored. I need to mindful of who I date and if their circle has quality people. 

He was extremely rude. When he got angry, he would punch chairs and break furniture. (His own words). I was honestly grateful that our relationship was long-distance, because if this had been in person, I would have feared potential violence. He once told me he threw his phone against a wall after his first ex cheated, purely out of rage, stating that's how men deal with anger. I don't think that's true. Hearing that terrified me. I treat my belongings gently and carefully, so stories like that genuinely scare me. During many arguments, I found myself relieved that we were not physically together, because I felt he wouldn’t be able to control his behavior in person. I knew I had love for him, but the fear was stronger and kept those feelings suppressed, because it was long distance. The distance meant I never had to witness his anger face to face, which honestly made it emotionally safer for me. 

THE IN-PERSON DATE WHICH SHOULD'VE GIVEN ME THE ICK:

I met him in person once. It was like meeting a cow in real life. He was walking ahead of me, didn't open doors or pull chairs, had zero chivalry, and seemed so nonchalant. I felt like I forced him to meet although he was the one who asked me to meet. He was basically cheating on me with his girl bestfriend, she texted him during the date. In recent times I had questioned him, and he said ""I don't know how to treat a girl in person"". Not something I expected from a grown man. He didn't put any effort into impressing me or whatsoever. So I don't understand why I even liked him? I'm sure another girl reading this last paragraph would probably laugh and spit her coffee. If I didn't like him in 2018-2020, I would've broken up after this 2024 in-person date. I stayed because, fantasy.

WHY I STAYED:

What kept me stuck was clinging to what my 18-year-old self dreamed of: dating the fantasy version of him. The reality was a manipulative, selfish person not suited for a relationship at all. 


TLDR: 

Stayed in an abusive relationship in 2023, 2024 and 2025, the guy cheated for a year, disrespected me every 2 weeks, secrecy about female friends, blaming and gaslighting that I'm the problem, etc. ,,, because of the fantasy version of him my younger self (2018-2020) made up in her head, I was crushing on him from 2018-2020 and he didn't know. The reality was a manipulative, selfish person not suited for a relationship at all.

QNet recruiters are actively targeting students, job seekers, and people going through tough times. They approach you through Instagram, Boo, LinkedIn, or random mutuals, act friendly, and then pitch a “start-up/business opportunity” without ever revealing the company name.

Once you trust them, they push you to “invest” ₹1–3 lakhs by taking loans, asking family, or using credit cards — only later you realise the money was used to buy overpriced products you never even needed.

They use emotional manipulation, fake motivation, secrecy, and guilt to trap you.

And recently, these guys are also sitting in mall cafés and popular coffee shops, pretending they’re earning big. They talk loudly about “hustle, dreams, passive income, making crores” just to make people around them notice and approach them. It’s all part of the trap. 🥴🤢😮‍💨

Please be alert:

If someone avoids revealing the company name — red flag

If they ask you to “believe first, understand later” — red flag

If they push loans or say “big opportunity” — RUN

If they say “don’t tell family or friends” — it’s a scam


Many people in Hyderabad, Vizag, Vijayawada and Bengaluru are getting trapped. Don’t let it be you.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764641876.0,TileTracker,0,0.5,False

I just wanted to know if there was anything that I can like study tomorrow I start on cold drinks so like making the cold fraps. 


And not to mention I suck at the POS I’ve never drank coffee before today was actually my first time drinking coffee, and knowing like the wording for the pos is so hard bc when I get something wrong or can’t find something he’s like behind me saying things like “come on you literally just read it out” or like “literally what are you doing”.

I passed by the UNC house on my nightly walk an hour ago, I scooped it out quite thoroughly in fact, though there motion censor yard lights caught me before I could go any further.
I believe I have more than enough to make my intentions clear however.

I demand to be on all news articles that may be published tomorrow, I have issued this demand to one news publisher already, however one is never enough.
if this demand is not met I will wait for the UNC's to have their outdoor activity time and I will tickle the UNC's as they come bouncing out.

while on my walk I found a couple on a park bench. I gagged them with their socks and tickled them both. I reported this crime via payphone once more. the male was more tickled than his wife. 
I used a series of pillow feathers this time instead of the Swiffer duster feather from the other night. I had lost it on my way to that payphone from the other, if you find it i'd appreciate it if you returned it, leave it in the centre of city 17.

I am a 21-year-old girl who has had eczema my whole life. However, it has never affected me so severely as it did a couple of years ago when I was 19/20. As people have mentioned in this sub, it felt like a disability. I had it everywhere, blood, flaking, crying, years of severe steroid use- the whole nine yards. 

I now have my eczema under control after two years of extreme suffering. I still get minor flare-ups, but they aren't painful and barely noticeable. 

My number one piece of advice: **A cream will not fix you.** A cream can help a bit; it can make it worse, but the problem (unless it's entirely contact dermatitis) is coming from an imbalance on the inside. So... you have to get out a pen and paper and start writing. There may be things you know will help you (e.g., a better diet), but if you note down which foods/drinks/weather make it worse, it provides a useful starting point. 

Here is what worked for me: 

* After many elimination diets and blood tests that said I had no allergies (proof that you have to trust your instincts!) **I realised that I was allergic to dairy**. I still eat some in small quantities infrequently. But if I indulge and have a glass of milk or a pizza, it's a nightmare. I can have feta, etc., and I take my coffee black, so it's relatively easy to avoid.
* **The eczema cream I was using made my skin redder.** One day, my boyfriend was applying Cetaphil to my back and said he could see it irritate my skin within seconds. I quit using traditional eczema creams and use Child's Farm regular baby moisturiser and coconut oil on my legs. 
* A note on steroids: if I get a flare-up, **I use Pimecrolimus cream.** It belongs to a class of drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) and works by suppressing the immune system in the skin to reduce inflammation and itching. Not as addictive as steroids, and I use it infrequently. 
* I love red wine. But **excessive alcohol consumption is obviously terrible.** It goes without saying that when I have a heavy weekend, my skin pays the price.
* In a similar vein, **QUIT SMOKING!** The single best thing I could've done for my skin. I know smoking is out of fashion nowadays, but if you smoke, quit. If not for your lungs, then for your skin! 
* **Yoga and meditation, and exercise,** even if it makes you flare up temporarily, it is crucial. I run and do pilates.
* Buy a water bottle and **drink a lot of water.** 
* I take supplements every day. Don't know how much they do, but I will list them in case they have contributed to my recovery: **Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, Cod Liver Oil, Probiotic, Vitamin D and Magnesium.** 
* **Analyse environmental factors:** when my eczema was at its worst, I lived in a cold, drafty flat that had mould. I also didn't wash my sheets thoroughly enough to remove all the residue from the creams. 
* **Stroke your skin when you can and take deep breaths.**
* I once had a doctor tell me, ""There is no such thing as too much moisturising for eczema"". Absolutely untrue! **I found that obsessively touching my skin and applying so much cream made it worse.** I used to carry a whole massive Cetaphil in my bag (I don't recommend this!)
* On a similar note, a dermatologist told me that the only chance I had of curing my eczema was moving to a different country with a better climate or paying thousands for Dupixent injections. Ignore anyone who says a medicine alone will fix it. **It is an internal imbalance**, made worse by stress, etc, but can be manageable if you figure out your triggers. 
* Finally, be kind to yourself. I remember being so miserable about my skin, and no one noticed it as much as I did. I know the worst thing is the pain, not the appearance. **You will figure out a way to manage it; it may just take time.**

I still have eczema, but I have my life back. I know what things will make it worse. As I write, I have a flare-up on my neck as I am very stressed with exams and have had too much dairy and a bad diet as of late. But it is nothing like it used to be. 

Often, eczema is our body holding onto traumatic experiences or reacting to something out of balance inside. 

Stay resilient! I am sending love to all the eczema warriors out there!

I'm not totally sure why and I'm also not totally sure the best way to 'fill' my cup so to speak.

I'm 38f. Married. I don't have a traditional full time job. I work at a local library. I do in person events a few times a week that last a couple of hours per event depending. I work 2 Mondays, 3 Tuesdays, every Wednesday, and 2 Thursdays a month plus any other special events that may pop up. Most of my work is done at home. How long and how much work varies. For example a storytime is picking out a theme, 3 relating books, an activity, at least two songs, a craft and then prepping for the event itself (cutting out things, creating/making activity, etc). At home I have livestock, and an active dog. That means I do chores twice a day, 365 days a year whether I want to, am sick, etc. It's usually not a big work load, feed and check on everyone then play with the dog for a minimum of 30 minutes. Thankfully we don't have a huge house, but I do the majority of all the housecleaning/organizing/decluttering. I cook dinner from scratch at least 5 days a week but sometimes 6 depending on the leftover situation. No dishwasher so all dishes are by hand. Take care of all the pets.

I feel like compared to other people I don't have a huge work load. But I feel like I am drowning. I'm completely overwhelmed in every aspect of my life. My to do list is ever growing, and I can't find the time to meaningfully decompress and relax. I wake up, coffee, chores, housework or library work, then it's time for chores again, then start prepping dinner, then eat, a bit of TV and rinse and repeat.

If the house isn't tidy and I'm not caught up with library work I just cannot disconnect and do nothing. Because I'm just getting further behind.

**Feeling Stiff After 50? 🧘‍♂️ Try This 5-Minute Morning Mobility Hack (Feels Amazing!)**

Hey everyone!

Anyone else wake up feeling like they've aged 20 years overnight? 😩 I know I do sometimes. Used to bounce outta bed ready to conquer the world, now it's more like *creak*... *groan*... slowly shuffle to the coffee maker.

But lately, I've been experimenting with something that's seriously made a difference, and I wanted to share it with you all. It’s just 5 minutes, and honestly, it feels *so* good. Think of it as WD-40 for your joints!

It's all about mobility, getting those joints moving and lubricated before you even have your first cup of joe. And no, you don’t need to be a yoga master.

Here's the super simple routine I've been doing:

*   **Neck Rolls (1 minute):** Slow, gentle circles. Forward, backward, side to side. You know the drill! Feel that tension melt away. Don’t force anything.
*   **Shoulder Shrugs & Rolls (1 minute):** Up to your ears, then roll 'em back and down. Feels amazing, right? Then reverse the direction. Pretend you're shrugging off all those worries about the stock market!
*   **Torso Twists (1 minute):** Just gentle twists from side to side. Keep your feet planted and move from your core. Imagine you're a palm tree swaying in a gentle breeze.
*   **Hip Circles (1 minute):** Hula hoop, anyone? But slower and more controlled. Clockwise, then counter-clockwise. My hips thank me every time.
*   **Ankle Rotations (1 minute):** Point your toes and draw circles with your feet. Both directions for each ankle. Pay attention to any creaks or pops, and be gentle.

Seriously, that's it! Five minutes.

I know, I know, it sounds almost *too* simple, right? But trust me, it makes a HUGE difference in how I feel throughout the day. No more feeling like a rusty robot!

What if you want to take it further? Some of us, **""we believe in strongest people.""** have discovered great resources. I found a neat little guide here [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts) with even more ideas for incorporating mobility into my routine.

Are there any mobility moves or stretches that you swear by? Anything you do to combat the morning stiffness? Or am I the only creaky one in the group? 😉 I'm always looking for new ideas. Maybe this will inspire you to try something new, or simply get you thinking about how you can prioritize your body in retirement. And hey, feeling good is a great way to start the day!

Let me warn you. This is a LONG post. And I want to get this out before my next doc appt (which is Thursday). Is it really anxiety or should I keep chasing??

These “issues” started 5.5 years ago a few months after I started working on the road as a lineman. The first experience was a 12am wake up out of a dead sleep. My entire body was tingling. Everytime I closed my eyes to try & go back to sleep, I felt like my heart would kick back up. Walked around the hotel (after making phone calls that weren’t being answered) & literally walked myself to exhaustion & knocked out at 3:30am. Next morning (5:30am), still felt like my feet were numb & left arm. Went to the ER, the doctor saw nothing out of the norm, was in the room for less than 5 min with 1 question & 1 statement. “Are you on drugs?” And “Looks like you need more calcium.” I remember my BP being around 160/101. Hypertension stage 2. Which was brushed off. 

Next time was a year/2 later.. had quit a job late at night after a near death experience with a stupid foreman. Had a 9hr drive home. Idiot me took a 5hr, about half way thru the drive and I felt like my heart was going to come out of my neck. Couldn’t talk, straight panic mode, felt like I was going to pass out. Was able to call the ambulance. But by the time they got there, I was grounded, on my feet, fine. Just kept checking my heart beat with my finger to my neck. 

These incidents have started to occur more often. Like in the deer stand the other morning, minding my business (drinking my caffeinated coffee which I normally drink decaf), I could feel it coming on. So I stood up, packed my things & walked to the truck. I waited for a while, felt shaky, tried to breathe thru it. Said okay, let’s go home. Get half way & I can’t breathe. Called my dad, pulled over, started letting him know what was going on. And the incident lasted for an hour & finally made it home. 

And I finally have a doctor who is trying to help. I have done a heart ultrasound. EKG. Bloodwork. Etc. There is nothing that seems to be out of the ordinary. But here lately within the last month, I feel like this pressure. My right arm will get tingly like a nerve is pinched. That’s new. Pressure on the sternum. A dull “pain” in my left shoulder blade & sometimes shoulder. And sometimes under my left nipple. 

The hydroxyzine makes me sleepy. I have been taking buspirone & I thought that was helping in the beginning, but now I feel it’s doing nothing. 

What can I do? What can I ask? Is it anxiety? Why are these “pains” more often and why are the palpitations & loss breath happening more often? I’m 31. I exercise. I cut caffeine out unless I grab some half caf coffee or some sweet tea. My BP in my recent appointments is normal. Can anxiety cause all of this?? Is anyone dealing with something like this? I’m so lost and at my wits end. Do I keep spending money on tests or do I just keep trying different meds?? 

If you made it this far. Thank you for sticking it out. I can answer any questions to help. Obviously this isn’t the doctors room, but I’m so tired of second guessing and fighting. Sometimes I’m afraid to fall asleep. Any help is much appreciated. ",2,1764641140.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

Hey, it's December 1st so we made an exception (any reason is good!). We went with:

* 1 1/2 oz Remy Martin VSOP
* 3/4 oz Campari
* 3/4 oz Lemon juice (Meyer's)
* 1/3 oz Maple Syrup

Shake with ice, double strain in coupe. Express a lemon peel and garnish with another one.

I really like those drinks that do not taste like their ingredients. This is really different and somehow at the end there's the taste of coffee!

I'm not really proud of my garnish here but Meyer's lemon are really tough to work with peel-wise. But they taste amazing and are a seasonal treat.

Late notice but I’m planning to watch Infinity Castle (subbed only) tomorrow, Tuesday, December around 11 am, 2:35 pm, or 6:10 pm at Century 25 in Union City. There are no showings in Fremont or Newark unfortunately. I’d really love to go with someone who’s already seen it and wants to experience it again 🌊 I've seen it 10 times 😬

I just want to talk about it before and/or after, share the excitement, maybe make a tiny peep of noise during the hype moments since everyone’s always so quiet 😭 and rock out and sing along to the music during the credits together 🐦‍⬛🎶

I won’t be getting snacks or drinks there, though I can bring us snacks and beverages for us. Maybe grab some hot tea/coffee after. I just really want to share the energy with another fan who loves this series as much as I do  😭 And geek out on other anime too 💕

other non-vitamin things I occasionally have had are like panax ginseng, dlpa, ashwagandha, apigenin, 5-htp, L-theanine, NAC. most of these are for sleep or relaxation but things like dlpa, theanine or panax ginseng honestly dont do much for me. admittedly none of these supps were from ND if that matters.

I've never had caffeine + l-theanine as actual pills before but i've had some 100mg or 200mg of l-theanine with my coffee at times and it never really did much. it would be great if something could mimic the effect of caffeine without crashes or impact on sleep.

I've browsed this sub and ND's website a fair bit and here's a list of things that seem viable for my goals:

n acetyl tyrosine (nalt)

sabroxy - deadass never heard of this one outside of ND but it seems like a holy grail for motivation & whatnot in the ND community.

rhodiola rosea: the 3% salidrosides variant seems the best for my needs. ND's salidrosol is quite preached as well. looks viable for wakefulness and mental stamina.

Dynamine - it seems like a smoother version of caffeine

alpha gpc / cdp choline - for long term cognition/focus

polygala - shows up in a lot of ND's buying guide stacks for energy, cognition, etc. never heard of this one either

  
at the bare minimum nalt + sabroxy seems the most tried and true so far. 

these are just my findings. I'm open to more personal/anecdotal suggestions.   
  
popping **all of these** each morning seems a bit extreme haha.

edit: it would be best if the stack contained things with long-term & consistent efficacy. reading through the sub there seem to be quite a few supps that are great but either dont hit the same after a couple weeks/months or show drawbacks later on.",2,1764640933.0,NootropicsDepot,1,1.0,False

 I feel bad because she obviously wants me to flirt back and act on it but this feeling of discomfort is too strong. At the same time I k ow how lucky I am to be receiving this kind of attention from a girl and she is by no means doing anything wrong in my eyes.

1pbvprq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodontalDisease/comments/1pbvprq/spent_20_years_flossing_wrong_and_just_learned/,Spent 20+ years flossing wrong and just learned the proper way," I've always been very serious about dental hygiene. My teeth have been straight and clean since I was a kid, and I've never had a filling. But in the past month or two, I sometimes noticed a weird smell on my dental floss. I had no idea why, because from the surface, my teeth still looked perfectly clean. Two weeks ago, I mentioned this to my dentist during a checkup. She said it might be interproximal caries and suggested taking bitewing X-rays to check the tiny gaps between my teeth. It turned out to be early interproximal decay.

The good news is that it's still early, so I don't need invasive treatments like drilling. I just need to improve my brushing technique, watch my diet, and use fluoride.

Diet-wise, I'm pretty confident. I don't like sweets, mostly just drink water, and even when I drink coffee I use a straw to avoid staining or erosion.  
 But when it comes to brushing technique, my dentist gave me two tips that completely changed how I thought about brushing:



* Apply a bit of fluoride toothpaste directly on the floss before cleaning the gaps between my teeth, which can more effectively reduce the risk of interproximal caries

  
  


* Don't rinse right after brushing; let the toothpaste stay in your mouth to extend the effect of the fluoride  

The second one really shocked me. Every time I brush without rinsing, it feels super uncomfortable, almost impossible to eat. But thinking about my interproximal decay getting worse and possibly needing deeper treatment, I couldn't ignore her advice.

After trying a few times, I finally found a routine I can tolerate:

* **After meals:** normal flossing + alcohol-free Listerine rinse

  
  


* **Before bedtime brushing:** apply fluoride toothpaste on floss and clean the gaps between my teeth (no rinsing), then take a shower to give the fluoride some time to work

  
  


* **After showering:** I use an electric toothbrush and brush for the full three minutes according to the built-in timer (and I still don’t rinse afterward)



* **Final key step:** Use the water flosser on the toothbrush to gently rinse between the teeth. A water flosser is super important! My soocas two-in-one comes with one, but if you only have an electric toothbrush, make sure you get a separate water flosser. A water flosser works differently from regular floss.Then I’ll rinse off most of the toothpaste with a bit of water, but I still won’t rinse it completely. I just let the leftover toothpaste stay on my teeth.  

With this routine, I can finally tolerate not rinsing after brushing.

Everyone's situation is different, but I think my dentist's advice makes sense and can really help prevent early interproximal caries from getting worse.

Do you guys have any other tips? I really care about keeping my teeth healthy.

I work at a museum basically, and we get a lot of school groups and today in particular, we had a large group of 3rd graders. My exes kid was in 3rd grade.

I bawled like a baby and had to put on sunglasses, and everyone noticed. I had to lie to everyone and say that I was having bad allergies or was just sweating from working so much.

I miss when he would wake up before his mom, and would come to the living room and watch TV with me. I miss when we would fight each other with squishmallows, I miss going out for pizza on Mondays and watching wrestling. I'm actively avoiding watching the new Stranger Things because that was kind of like one of our family shows we'd watch together.

I miss going to get tacos on days I would watch him and seeing him watch the waitress pour coffee into my cup, and asking me ""Is that the best?"". You better believe it buddy.

I miss going on walks to the church, and pissing mom off by making hot wheels tracks that would take over the whole house. 

I had to make small talk with these kids at work today, a lot of them were wearing unspeakable shirts which was one of his favorite you tube channels. I asked a few of them what they're favorite video was and told them I liked the one where they turn their whole house into a snow scape complete with penguins.

They asked if I watched with my son, and I had to lie to them and say yes, because what 40 year old man watches unspeakable?

They will either tell you to ""ask out girls you find attractive"" or ""just be yourself and let girls come to you"". To be honest, the latter leads to easier success and some players will purposely augment themselves to be more attractive, therefore getting women naturally. Even in the book models, a famous dating book that people quote time to time, says to pick a lane and then be the best person in the lane. Women naturally gravitate to leaders of an environment.

The problem is what if you arent a leader or have a special talent in order to become one? Even if you could, what if it takes 5 years to reach that level? Is it worth it especially if you are in your late 20s. Most chads, guys who are naturally good with girls, dont even realize what they are doing to get girls. They will be the one to do the former, which is to ask a girl out that you like. The problem is that they neglect the fact that the girl already liked them. 

Then there are some dudes who act like there are girls who like you no matter where you are. The problem is being picky lol. Sure, the hottest girl really does likes me but she is just wanting for me to have confidence. This is probably the worse take out of all of them.

The best advice I was given was that you should have had built yourself in your early 20s so that way you have the social circle to eat from. Starting late just makes it harder regardless if you are trying to better yourself. This is my situation as a 28 yr old man.

Just a random example because it's what sparked the thought, but I work in an office and there's like 30 door to door sales guys who come in and out for meetings. And they stop by the kitchen to get coffee and other things.

I do have a decent amount of free time so I do the dishes a lot. I do my dishes and other peoples when I see it.

Well my boss messaged me today saying the weekly cleaners came in and complained to someone higher up about dishes being in the sink saying it's ""not in their list of duties to do the dishes"" and sent him a picture of a mug and a spoon in the sink.... I told the boss ""no problem, I'll make sure it stays empty, I am regularly doing the dishes but there's like 30 sales people who come in and out and drop off dishes at random hours of the day and sometimes I'll miss them"".

I always feel like I'm being petty when I'm putting a bit of the blame on others but only when it feels like there's genuinely a reason to do so.

But I'm wondering if I should stop going about things this way and just say ""no problem I'll do that"" and maybe stop bringing others into it. I'm don't want to throw people under the bus , I just really want to avoid being involved with work complaints. And I feel like this situation could easily happen again.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

These 500 days have been a rollercoaster. Here is some of what I’ve learned.

1. It’s okay that it took me 45 years to realize the church is not true. I was brainwashed since I was a sunbeam. IYKYK 

2. It’s okay that I don’t know if I believe in God anymore. Being agnostic isn’t a moral failing.

3. Most of my friendships survived. The ones that didn’t probably weren’t worth saving.

4. Being in a mixed faith marriage is *really* hard. I hope my marriage survives, but if it doesn’t, I’ll be okay, eventually. 

5. My kids will be fine being raised outside of Mormonism. 

6. My Mom may be disappointed in me for the rest of her life. I’ll love her anyways.

7. It’s okay to be both happy and sad that Mormonism isn’t true.

8. I may never be ready to try alcohol. That’s okay. 

9. Coffee + heavy cream is wonderful.

10. This ExMormon group has been a lifeline.

Thank you for 500 days of ExMormon Reddit!! I have appreciated all of the stories, discussions, and advice.

My story is nothing special and you have probably heard it many times before. My ex girlfriend of four years broke up with me two years ago, and ever since then I have felt like I lost a key part of myself.

Before the breakup she got into a university on the literal other side of the world. At first I was skeptical and even suggested that we should break up right then so she could leave without a relationship holding her back. She insisted that distance would not tear us apart and that when she came back we would get married. I was completely in love and I believed her.

Not even three months passed before she ended things over a video call, which she had to do since she was so far away. I was devastated and said some hurtful things in the moment. After that I tried to remove every object that emotionally tied me to her. I got rid of cards, gifts, videos and anything else that reminded me of our relationship. Once I was done, we basically stopped talking. Much later she emailed me a letter asking how I was doing and telling me she was in a terrible place mentally and could not eat or sleep well. She said she hoped we could meet for coffee if she ever came back to our town, but she also made it clear that she was done with the relationship. I replied politely and said I hoped we could see each other again someday.

It sounds like I should have been able to move on. I should have met new people and had new experiences. That did not happen. I stayed stuck on her and on what we had together. Whenever I met someone new, I felt like I was cheating on her. There were so many times when I almost reached out to her to beg her to take me back, but somehow I managed to keep a little bit of dignity and I never did it. It also helped, in a painful way, that when I searched for her on social media I realized she had blocked me everywhere.

Eventually the intensity of the obsession faded, until today. I asked a friend to help me find out more about her out of simple curiosity, and he came back with the worst news I could have imagined. She had moved on a long time ago and had started seeing someone else only a few months after breaking up with me. Now I feel like I am back at the beginning, and I do not think I have ever felt so pathetic. I feel like I should have moved on by now and that I have wasted years longing for someone who moved on quickly and easily, even after telling me I was the only one for her and that she would rather die than be apart.

So my question is this. What do I do now. I feel like I have done everything possible to remove her presence from my life, but thoughts of her still appear every day and dreams of her still show up every night. I do not know what else to do and I feel like I am losing my mind.

1pbvhdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pbvhdh/poor_experience_with_onyx/,Poor Experience with Onyx,"I ordered an Advent calendar on the 19th, fully aware that it likely wouldn’t arrive by December 1st since the guaranteed delivery date only applied to orders placed by the 17th. I also placed a separate order for a pre-order coffee that was listed to ship on the 20th.

On the 21st, I contacted customer service to ask if there was an estimated shipping timeline for both orders—mainly because the pre-order coffee hadn’t shipped. The following email exchange was a bit inconsistent: I was initially told they couldn’t give me an estimated shipping date for the Advent calendar, but later in the exchange I was told it would ship the following Tuesday (the 25th), and that if it didn’t, I should reach back out. So I waited.

When Tuesday came and went with no shipping notification, I contacted customer service again. At that point, I was told I could pay an additional $40 for expedited shipping, or wait for it to ship on Friday (the 28th). I chose to wait since I didn’t want to spend extra. For context: at this same time, their website stated that new orders placed *after* mine would ship on December 1st.

Friday passed with no update, and Saturday brought no shipping confirmation either. I opened a new ticket, expecting a response on Monday (December 1st). If their advertised timeline was accurate, newer orders should have been shipping on Dcember 1st—yet I still had no confirmation. The last update I received was that the customer service representative had reached out to their fulfillment manager to figure out why my order hasn’t shipped.

To be clear, the customer service reps have all been kind, and I’ve expressed my appreciation to them multiple times. This has just been a very poor experience for the most part.

Again I'd like to re-iterate I had no expectation of receiving it by the 1st but there was no expectation set that order placed after mine would ship first and that it wouldn't ship till December. ",5,1764639579.0,pourover,19,0.65,False

I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Alice: Madness Returns, Signalis, and Mario Odyssey. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

1pbv5jy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pbv5jy,Mid-Game Setup,"Since my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1od5e3i/start_game_setup/) I've made a lot of changes. I'll just list out all of the new stuff.

\*\*Gaggimate Pro Gaggia Classic Pro E24\*\*

This replaced both my Flair Pro 3 and my Delonghi ECP3420.

I returned the Flair Pro 3 because, while it was cool, it was a lot of work and I didn't really use it quite as often as I thought I would.

The level of customizability with automated flow/pressure profiling and a PID-controlled heater is crazy. I run tea, drip coffee, lever machine and all sorts of other profiles on this machine. Steaming is also a lot more usable now and I have practically endless steam.

The install itself wasn't that bad and it's made a solid machine even better. At this point, I feel like my next machine will probably be in the $3K+ range if I even upgrade, I have no desire to go back to an analog machine at any price point now, maybe a Decent DE1Pro will find its way onto my counter eventually.

\*\*MiiCoffee CF64V\*\*

This has been a pretty solid grinder thus far, its probably placebo but I feel like this has added a lot of ""dimensionality"" to my shots. I feel like I get more flavor separation. My ESP still gets plenty of beans sent its way for cold brew and pour over as well.

I cross-shopped this against the Fellow Ode and choose it due to the more powerful motor, espresso-focused burrs out of the box, adjustable RPM, lack of Fellow tax and its relation to the DF64 series grinders. Has pretty minimal retention and is roughly as loud as my Baratza.

\*\*Coffee\*\*

I expanded my horizons quite a lot, ordered my first Gesha from Perc which should be here soon and also got a few of their other light roasts which are amazing.

\*\*Knockbox\*\*

Moved to a more compact [knock box](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1664933-knockknock-3d-printed-espresso-knock-box). Printed the outer body and bar in PETG with a TPU sleeve on the bar and a PLA bin.

\*\*WDT Tool\*\*

3D-printed the [Umikot](https://makerworld.com/en/models/169731-umikot-58mm-version-planetary-gear-spirograph-espr?from=search#profileId-186634) after seeing how much companies wanted for their own versions. Has worked nicely so far.

\*\*V60/OXO Dripper\*\*

Got these for pourover, don't use them quite as often but sometimes its fun to experiment with alternative ways of making coffee.

\*\*Hario Maru Teapot\*\*

1pbv5bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1pbv5bc/my_church_is_being_overrun/,My church is being overrun,"Went to divine liturgy on Sunday and it was standing room only with multiple kids on laps. The nave felt warm and frenetic from all the body heat. I found it difficult to concentrate with all the kids running around, crying, or on ipads. The coffee hour was packed and I didn't even try to get any food. A year ago this sort of thing only happened on Christmas, but now it's a weekly phenomenon. Does anyone else's church have an issue with overcrowding? How'd you solve it aside from building a new church? We live in a poor rural area, I never thought we'd see this many people trying to join at once. We thought having 5 catechumen was a lot... Now we have over 20. I expected the ""ortho fad"" to die out given how fickle American moods and sentiments are, but it appears we still have yet to reach the peak of the orthosphere revival. Anyways, I just wanted to share my anecdote. I'm not trying to whine or complain, I'm genuinely happy the church is growing. I can't wait to meet all my new brothers and sisters in Christ. I'm happy to see all the kids being raised inside the one true church. But part of me misses the peaceful intimacy the divine liturgy used to imbue my soul with. I worry that the divine presence may continue to fade as we grow. ",15,1764638658.0,OrthodoxChristianity,63,0.67,False

She was upset earlier because she wanted her dad's coffee and he told her she couldn't have it (for obvious reasons) but that she could have something else. Meltdown ensues, sitting against the cabinet screaming that she wanted her own, and when told she could pick a different drink but needed to try and calm down she replied with ""I DON'T WANT TO. I JUST WANT TO SCREAM FOR A LITTLE"".

 Not sure what to do in this situation 
honestly. Generally if she doesn't chill out in a few minutes one of us will just go set her on her bed and we walk off (door is kept open). Talking to her to try and calm her down does NOT work. She just continues getting worked up and will generally say she doesnt want to listen/talk/take a deep breath/calm down/etc. Not even sure I'm actually looking for advice here mostly just venting cause I'm at an absolute loss.

1pbv3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1pbv3e4/what_is_my_coworker_up_to/,What is my co-worker up to?,"I started my job in my office a while ago and mostly just focused on learning my job and keeping my head down. A month in, I met a coworker who saw me while walking by. She came up to me to introduce herself and I thought little of it except that she was a friendly and outgoing person. Suddenly, I started seeing her a lot more. 

We work in different areas so there’s not necessarily a good reason for her to be around me but she still found a way to visit me and I eventually reciprocated. We started talking on teams and then it escalated to phone calls when we had downtime and then to text and phone calls while we are away from work. She asks a lot of questions about myself and my family and my ambitions and she is very good at remembering these details. 

It goes without saying that we love to talk to each other, we’ve both said the same thing and we try to find every excuse. We have banter and a ton of inside jokes just from a couple months of this escalating interaction. She hugs me every day at least once (which I don’t see her do with anybody else). She calls me “dear” and things like that. We bond over being hard workers and having similar career ambitions. We always have each other’s backs. 

All innocent enough. I find out she has a boyfriend (never mentioned him except a couple times to say he’s made her cry or something). It seems pretty clear to me then that she just sees me as a friend and someone who’s easy to talk to. That’s fine, it’s some peace of mind since I had been wondering a bit. Our conversations are still always playful and sometimes outright flirty but never explicit. She likes to mess with my office and hide things and leave gifts. She compares our heights often and the size of our feet or hands. Her body language is open, leaning in toward me, not afraid to touch me, she adjusts her hair a lot and asks me how I think it looks. She’s not the best at eye contact and sometimes looks away but says I’m very good at it.

Then things started to escalate. We get lunch many days, she comes over to our break room to hang out, she treats me to coffee a few times. Coworkers start to notice. Everyone tells me she’s talking about me like I’ve been missing her whole life or they’re telling me that she is really into me (but nobody can tell me anything concrete or a quote, it’s just people interpreting vibes). I brush it off and tell everyone she’s just a friend and they roll their eyes like I’m an idiot.

Last week, she called me after work and we ended up talking for over five hours. It was completely effortless for both of us. The following night, we did something after work for the first time. One thing led to another and we went out for drinks which turned into dinner and then more drinks on a Friday night. 7 pm to 5 am just the two of us having a blast all around town. We even ended up at my house and she begged to go up to my bedroom to check it out (nothing happened, we were both wasted and I kept my distance intentionally but I don’t remember anything about her tone or body language, just her being playful as she sat on my bed). 

She had such a good time that she wanted to do it again the very next night, so we did that for the same amount of time. She complimented my hair, said it was perfect and I should grow it out. We hiked around a park with a beautiful night view of the city. She brought up the idea of hanging out again soon, and even floated the idea of going on a trip to the city or my home state together (just the two of us). 

We spoke again the following day while she was on her night shift and talked about an hour this time during her breaks. She very much enjoyed the time together. The problem is, I’m dealing with regrets and anxiety over her. She seems to me to be coming on so strongly and so quickly. We’ve known each other for just a few months. It’s not normal to be dating someone but then spend 30 hours in one week talking and going out for drinks with your opposite sex coworker - right? It seems insane. I have a few friends who are women and we are noooooothing like this. 

If she mentioned her boyfriend every five minutes then I could take a hint and maybe have peace of mind. Yet I can’t even begin to picture how she’s finding the time to interact meaningfully with him or her other friends. To me and to everyone I know, it seems like she’s really into me. I’m just hoping to hear someone explain that she just sees me as a trusted friend and that this is a normal thing for coworkers to do. 

It’s impacting my productivity and professionalism a little bit and my sanity a lot. I don’t want to steal her away from her boyfriend or even be an outlet for emotional cheating. Yeah, I’d love if she was actually into me because I have never had a friend or girlfriend that I could talk to like I can with her. I’m having the time of my life. Yet I would prefer to have her as just a friend if the reality is as awkward and messy as I fear it is. 

I’m thinking about putting up a wall and keeping her 10 feet away because it seems like the only smart move, which kills me because I didn’t even know life could be this fun. I feel guilt and like I should have backed off a long time ago and not reciprocated.

TLDR: coworker with a boyfriend is trying to spend hours a week with me doing stuff I can’t really see platonic work friends doing. God this whole thing feels stupid and immature and reckless. ",4,1764638518.0,bodylanguage,7,0.83,False

[The Extreme Library](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/the-extreme-library)

This is one that’s been kicking around in my head for a dozen years or more - a library that is also an infinite source of dungeon/adventure, a weird connection to the demesne of the Gods of Knowledge. There are a few ways I’ve considered building this one out, and one of the ones I keep coming back to is Daniel Solis’ system from Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple. Writing a journal as a game about a library feels… Fitting. 

What I Like About This One:

Basically nothing. I needed to get a game out, I’m out of ideas, and I’m super, extra done. I’ll come back and re-do this one later. 

What I’d Do Differently Next Time: 

Everything. lololol I didn't even make art for this one.

Driver didn’t even look mystical or guru-ish, just a dude vibing like he was 2 coffees behind in life. 

We roll off n suddenly every corner starts looking like a rerun from the life....
 i kinda lived but also kinda ditched cuz i got tired or scared or whatever dumb excuse i told myself back then,i’m literally staring out the window like wtf is this the nostalgia speedrun dlc pack?

We pass the field where i used to skip class n pretend i was deep but really i was just tired n broke n annoyed at everyone      breathing near me,  then that diner pops up...the one where i used to eat fries w people i don’t even text anymore. ain’t that weird? like u spend years w someone, share dumb jokes n break your heart in lil ways together.

Then boom one random tuesday they’re just… gone from your whole damn timeline, i’m laughing to myself like bro life really be like “new cast every season hope u keep up.”

Then the driver goes “u miss any of them?” like he’s reading my mind or eavesdropping on the chaos echoing in my skull. i’m like “nah.. maybe… idk man it’s complicated,” which is basically the human version of shrugging at ur own existence.

 Bcoz yea sometimes i miss them, sometimes i don’t, sometimes i miss the idea of what i thought we were instead of what we really were. real messy adult brain rot type vibes.

The ride keeps glitching between funny n weirdly painful like i’m in some emotional drive-thru ordering “one large regret, extra stupid decisions on the side.” 

And right when i’m spiralin real good the uber swings past this one spot—oh man—this one lil street corner where i saw her last time. that special one, 
the one i thought would be like… permanent. 
silly me.

 She’s not even there now obviously but my chest did that stupid flip like my body didn’t get the memo that life moved on....

n it’s wild cuz the minute i think i stabilized mentally the gps finally fixes itself and we r back on normal route, but my brain? 

Bro my brain is still doing rollercoaster loops, no seatbelt, hands up screaming lmaoo.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I could eat 35 200mg caffeine pills for the price of 1 bang energy drink. I don’t really like the taste of energy drinks too. I’ve drank the same orange bang energy drink or reign just because I’ve always drank them but don’t like the taste but continue to buy them because they are my flavors.

Now I can just wake up take 1 caffeine pill and I’m set for the day

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

It’s designed for anyone who finds big social events overwhelming or just prefers smaller, more intentional hangs. We usually do coffee, games, light activities, or outdoor meetups where it feels easy to talk and connect.

🗓 Our next meetup is **Dec 13 at 1 PM at Brash Coffee** in Buckhead

We keep it small with usually 5–8 people attending, so it stays cozy and comfortable.

If you’re new to Atlanta, socially rusty, or just craving genuine connection, we’d love to have you.

Even if you’re unsure, filling this out helps us shape future meetups around what people want.",10,1764638062.0,AtlantaLocals,1,1.0,False
