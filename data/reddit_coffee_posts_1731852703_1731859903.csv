1gtgszw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1gtgszw/guide_to_efficient_upgrading_of_core_skills/,üåü Guide to Efficient Upgrading of Core Skills üåÄ,"**Disclaimer: This method was supposed to be a comment on** [**this post.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1gt7s8v/the_upgrading_experience/) **This is my personal way of grinding so whether you follow this guide or not is up to you.üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéÆ** 

Hey Proxies! üëã After countless hours of grinding for the Core Skills of Agents, I come to a conclusion on a way to make it somewhat efficient.  
  
Here's what you'll find in this guide:

* üîç My personal discovery process
* üìà Time management
* üí° Mistakes to avoid

Whether you're a new Agent or a seasoned player, this guide will give or give you not the edge on grinding (try on your own risk xD). Get ready to transform your understanding of Core Skill upgrades and take your ZZZ gameplay to the next level! or probably notüí•

So first off, let's talk about how did I discover this method of mine.  In the first day of grinding the core skills, I discover that it takes a long time to grind to A to F. The needed materials needed to fully upgrade the core skills are the following (example use for Ellen Joe): 

* 9 Ferocious Grips (9x Notorious Hunt) - *Gives 1 of the materials.*
* 60 Murderous Obituary (12x Expert Challenge) - *Gives 5 of the materials.*

It takes about **240 Battery Charges**¬†to complete 9 challenges, considering the first 3 are free (*assuming the week resets*) for *Notorious Hunt.*  
And it takes about **720 Battery Charges** to complete 12 challenges for the *Expert Challenges.*

**SO THATS ABOUT 960 Battery Charges!** to complete one character's full core skill from A to F.

*NOTE: IDK IF MY MATH IS CORRECT BUT SURE.*

Now for the method I discover, instead of upgrading the core skill of one character fully? **Why not upgrade the core skills of each character in a team? LET ME EXPLAIN!**

First off for upgrading the core skills for a team sounds ridiculous right!  
**BUT** **NOT** **IF YOU ONLY DID CORE SKILL A TO D FOR EACH CHARACTER IN A TEAM EACH DAY**. (*IDK if my method is viable but I'll share it anyways and I also don't know if some ppl already do this kind of thing so yeah).*

**The cost of that and the time needed will be significantly lower.** *(TAKE THIS WITH A HUGE GRAIN OF SALT)*

**COST FOR A TO D CORE SKILLS:**

* 2 Ferocious Grips (2x Notorious Hunt)
* 15 Murderous Obituary (3x Expert Challenge)

So the **Batter Charge for both would be 260 (***40 √ó 2 Notorious Hunt = 80, 60 √ó 3 Expert Challenges = 180***) About a fully stack Battery Charge which is 240.**  
*Note: I use my excess Battery Charge to compensate the remaining required amount if I already drank the coffee from Coff Cafe.*

So each day you do this until all of your *Agents* in one team comp has their *Core Skills upgraded to A to D.* 

**NOW IF YOU HAVE THE A TO D FOR ALL THREE AGENTS,** then we can start doing the E to F!

**MIGHT AS WELL WRITE THE COST:**

* 4 Ferocious Grips (4x Notorious Hunt)
* 30 Murderous Obituary (6x Expert Challenge)

So the **Battery Charge for both would be 520** **(***40 √ó 4 = 160 for the 40 cost, and 60 √ó 6 = 360 for the 60 cost***)**.

**Total Battery Charge Required = 160 + 360 = 520 Battery Charge,** which takes about 2 days to upgrade E to F tops? who knows.

Once you done all that you have now a team with fully upgraded Core Skill from A to F! 

I think it takes about a week to fully upgrade the core skill of a whole team (*assuming your willing to use your excess Backup Battery Charge or Ether Battery) I also forgot there is Coffee everyday I now just realize xD.*

*NOTE: YEA I THINK UPGRADING CORE SKILL TO A TO F IS FASTER TEE HEE!*  
*NOTE: TRY MY METHOD ON YOUR OWN RISK!*",0,1731859620.0,ZZZ_Official,0,0.5,False

I would ask in the Stack mega thread but it seems that‚Äôs not engaged with often - I‚Äôm waking up every morning with what seems to be Sinus Headaches and wonder if my supplements are hurting me rather than helping.  Here‚Äôs my basic background and would love any constructive input üëç

I‚Äôm a 30 YOM who exercises regularly (walks every day / does strenuous weight training 3-4 times a week) and eats a healthy diet the majority of the time.  I‚Äôm a full time firefighter/paramedic so my sleep schedule is less than ideal - I work 24 hour shifts at a busy station so being exhausted is not unusual.  On my days following shift I‚Äôll nap either 90 minutes of it was a good night or sleep 4 hours if we barely slept at all.  Days off shift I usually get 7-8 hours of sleep. 

Supplements / Meds I take :
-Wixar Ten Treasure Mushroom Powder in my morning coffee (only cup of the day)
-400-600 mg L-Theanine throughout the day 
- Half gram Lions Mane Extract (Fungies) 
- 500mg Vitamin C
- 1200mg (360mg Omega 3) Fish Oil
- K2+ D3 (both 100 mcg)
- Claritin
- Half Gram Reishi Extract (Fungies) at night
- 120 mg Magnesium Glycinate at night
- Recent discontinued a B-Complex multivitamin as my urine was heavily discolored for the first few hours of the day and was worried I was overdoing it

I also drink plenty of water.  It‚Äôs November so the seasonal allergies around me have died off, so I heavily doubt it‚Äôs allergies causing this consistent morning headache.
In terms of what I take - do you guys see any red flags?

Thank you very much!!

That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm doing it. I‚Äôm writing this from a lovely little coffee shop and it hit me that this is where I want to spend my mornings - weekends and weekdays instead of working at a job that is no longer challenging me and that I no longer have passion for. I‚Äôve been hesitant to pull the plug for two reasons, 1) despite the above my job is moderately high paying and not very demanding and I could never find myself in this situation again, 2) I have not identified a meaningful way to spend a big chunk of my free time.

I realize now that if I don‚Äôt put energy into #2, I‚Äôll wake up ten years from now still on the fence. Hence the title of this post, giving myself a timeline to get this figured out. 

Financially, I believe I‚Äôm fine:
-NW: $1.75M
-Home: 700K HCOL
-Debt: 0
-49F
-single no dependents
-annual cost of living: $35K

Plan
-Work 1 more year, invest ~$90K
-Take 4-6 months off
-explore low cost hobbies OR
-Get PT job or volunteer for structure OR
-Find FT job that challenges me
-not interested in travel

But when I made coffee this morning, there were no grounds in the basket. It's very unlikely I emptied it at some point for no reason. 

A bright side I can put with this is that I'm happy I am being able to drink coffee despite my diagnosis.

edit: The memory just came back to me: I emptied and rinsed the grounds holder. But when I put it back in, I closed the lid when I took out the coffee pot to fill it with water. I usually keep the lid open. Having to re-open it set my mind on this tangent. Yay for our memory-wiping medications!",1,1731859020.0,Epilepsy,2,1.0,False
1gtgknq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pepecoin/comments/1gtgknq/not_for_a_third_time/,Not for a third time...,"This is a life lesson post I wanted to make about not taking risk/trusting your gut. 

I first heard about bitcoin in 2013  when I was a teenage after that guy tossed out his Bitcoin by mistake when clearing out his old IT equipment. I didn't know much about it at that point and back then $70 was a lot of money to me so I never brothered investing. I remember being on bitbargain hovering over the purchase button but being too scared to press it. I let the voices of everyone was saying 'its a waste' or 'it will never take off' get into my head. My gut told me I should buy it, but I didn't listen to myself. 

Fast forward to doge coin, I'm now working at this point and have some more money I hear about doge and but I only decided to buy 400,000 coins for pennies because I was too scared to splash out. I held out for a long time but again the cries of 'its never going to go up' 'its a üí© coin' 'it will never reach 0.01' got into my head. My gut told me to hold on and forget about it but like an idiot I pulled out when my wallet hit a crappy $800 (I bought a phone which I needed so not an entire waste). 

Anyway on to Pepecoin - its been a long time since I've had a gut feeling about any Cypto and after my last two disasters I stayed away for a long time but for some reason my gut is telling me to bet on $PEP. I know it's a meme coin, I know there are crypto scams and rug pullers and no guarantee but I'm not making a mistake for a third time. This time I'm all in an I'm going to let it ride. 

My advice is don't be me as a teen, don't be me with doge. Instead of spending $100 getting 2 take outs this week or $5 on a shitty cup of coffee invest it in $PEP. You were going to waste your money anyway and so even if it doesn't work out, even if it does go to crap and you lose your investment it doesn't matter. Because what will matter is if you don't and suddenly you wake up this time next year and $PEP is up to 0.001 or even 0.01 and you realised you missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime.

1gtgjub,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HisSunshine3-9/comments/1gtgjub/golf_tournament/,Golf tournament ,"Hi. D is here for the golf tournament that was supposed to be a few weeks ago but got cancelled because the hurricane trashed the course. Now it's today on a Sunday and I don't get to go, because I can't miss work like that. Every day is great money sooooo yeah. Plus this year just feels weird. Not allowed to drive the booze cart anymore because the people got mad that no one was buying booze from them. Stupid. I hope today goes quickly. I am too tired for all of this shit. No matter how much I rest, I just can't catch up on feeling normal. 

On a good note, I lost 5 lbs. I can definitely feel the medicine working. I'm not craving bad shit all the time and I do intermittent fasting without even trying because I don't even eat my first meal until like 2 or 3. I just have my coffee in the am. Today was my first dose of the new kind of shots. It's supposed to be the best one out there right now. I am hoping by the time a few months is gone I will be down 20 lbs. I wanna be around 150-155 in a size 6. That would be perfect. I got a 3 month supply so we will see where I'm at in the end to see if I'm going to need more or if I will be done. 

I gotta get up for work. Hope you have a good day.

I have a few question hoping you pros can answer 

1. Will the Nespresso machine be going on sale for Black Friday at any retailers? 
2. Do the reusable capsules work on the vertuo machines ? 
3. Any coffee recommendations that are similar to the Starbucks Pike k cup? I like my coffee strong, but not near the espresso level (or size lol) 
5. Is it true that Nespresso coffee tastes stronger due to because of the proper brewing level or is all Nespresso coffee a little stronger? 
4. Read over the past posts that some machines have more issues than others. Which one should I stay away from? 

Any suggestions, tips or tricks will be gladly appreciated. My parents have an espresso machine but I‚Äôm not a big fan of the small sips you get from espresso if you guys get what I‚Äôm saying. I like to actually enjoying my coffee in the mornings, especially when I work from home. I‚Äôm sure everyone can agree that the first coffee of the day can make your day go from 0 to 100 just by the way it tastes. ",1,1731858792.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

Basically you poach eggs in the microwave and then dress them up with seasoning. I made some from memory 25 years later and it turns out it‚Äôs held up and is incredibly easy.

Recipe:
Crack two eggs in a coffee mug

Add a dollop of butter

Microwave for 30-40 seconds, you want the yolks fully runny and the white barely set.

Dress it up, salt and pepper are a must but you can add Parmesan, bacon bits, chives, basically anything


Mash it up with a spoon, you‚Äôre looking for a stew like consistency where the runny parts act as the base but there are still good sized  bits of the white",2,1731858758.0,EatCheapAndHealthy,1,0.75,False
1gtghkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/1gtghkd/xps_or_inspiron_1314_inch_laptop/,XPS or Inspiron 13-14 inch laptop?,"I'm pretty settled on getting a Dell as my new laptop. I love my XPS desktop, and frankly I am fatigued by scouring through different makes and models.

I want a tinier laptop which is highly portable, yet the screen is big enough to work on for several hours at a time. My current laptop is an 11ish inch Lenovo, so 13-14 inches would already be a huge upgrade in size. That said, if you think that getting a larger screen would be worth it, I'd appreciate your input. I work with spreadsheets, some programming, and lots of document reading/scanning.

My main question is if I should go with the current XPS or current Inspiron. I want something light and small enough to be able to open up anywhere - on a small coffee table at a cafe without knocking over my coffee, on the train, on the couch, etc. At the same time, it should be very convenient for sitting down and working for several hours at my desk.

The two models I am considering (but open to other set ups and suggestions) are the following:

https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-xps-13-copilot-pc-13-4-fhd-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-series-2-with-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-graphite/6598704.p?skuId=6598704

I love the look of the XPS, but I am not a fan of the new style of trackpad. Is it something you get used to and doesn't slow you down? Same with the keyboard. It is appealing that it's roughly 1lb lighter at 2.6lbs.

As for the Inspiron, is the build quality good enough? As mentioned, I'd be carrying the laptop everywhere with me and using it every which way. While I am extremely careful with my things, I don't want it to break if I drop it lightly while on the train, for example. (I don't plan on doing that, but something to consider just in case). Of course I prefer the price of the Inspiron. The keyboard and trackpad are more familiar to me. I almost never use my laptop's USB ports, so that's not so major to me.

And for raw computing power, which is better (in the base-ish line of Intel i7)? Sometimes I have to do things which are quite demanding on the machine.

I really appreciate everyone's help with this!",1,1731858758.0,Dell,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

I‚Äôve linked my original post below but TLDR: My friend stole from a boutique, store, salon, and motel and from me so I'm considering canceling a trip we planned. 

Since I originally posted, I‚Äôm very strongly considering canceling the trip and am currently looking into how to get refunded for things we paid for already. I grabbed coffee with her Thursday morning and we had a relatively short talk. I confronted her about my missing shirt and she swore that she didn‚Äôt steal it and hasn‚Äôt stolen since I originally confronted her a couple months ago about her stealing from stores and the hotel. She insists she‚Äôs been going to therapy and working on herself a lot. I‚Äôm not sure what to think and still feeling torn if I‚Äôm being honest. I searched more places in my apartment where the shirt could have been but still can‚Äôt find it. I also tried looking online to see if the shirt was sold at the store she claimed she got it from but didn‚Äôt find anything. 

I understand the valid concern of safety traveling internationally that everyone has been sharing. But on the other hand, she‚Äôs one of my best friends, we were roommates for three years and have been friends for over 10 years. I‚Äôm just not sure what to believe or whether or not to trust her. I‚Äôve never had a friend lie or steal from me or make me feel this type of way and it‚Äôs really sucked but part of wonders if she didn‚Äôt steal my shirt and it was just somehow a really odd mix up and maybe she really has been working on herself and getting the help she needs. For those of you claiming she lied about going to therapy entirely, I really think she is going because she would talk about going to therapy before all this happened. She had said she hadn‚Äôt told her therapist about her stealing problem until I confronted her about the clock and stealing from stores. She claims she told her therapist after that and has been working with her therapist on this. So what would you do moving forward? ",12,1731858617.0,TwoHotTakes,12,1.0,False

Long story short her content is centered around the fact that she lives in an RV and that her ex husband cheated on her with her best friend. 

She‚Äôs always been problematic; from calorie counting her daughter‚Äôs food intake, putting her kids to bed at an ungodly early hour, coffee enemas, the list goes on.

Fast forward to her post yesterday where she‚Äôs distraught, and wipes away the non existent tears from her face. Apparently her boyfriend of 2.5 years, who has never formed a relationship with her own children, just found out he‚Äôs a father to a child he did not know existed and conveniently was conceived a month before they started dating. Keep in mind she was also house hunting with this man despite the fact he had almost no relationship with her kids. 

This woman has always been a red flag and I normally never post, just comment, but I‚Äôve been dying to talk to other people about this. Her comment section is justifiably calling her out and the story as a whole just does not sound right. If her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt on the birth certificate, it would make more sense that the mom finally decided to tell him he has a kid if she was looking for child support. However, Rebekah claims she called her boyfriend because she wants him to sign over rights. Is that even a thing that he would have to do if he was never on the birth certificate? 

I‚Äôm probably missing some good tidbits but her latest video sent me over. I actually watched it without sound at first and when you purely watch as she struggles to look distraught, it is almost comical and if I thought she was a better person I‚Äôd say she was rage baiting.

When they arrive and park there car, their ‚Äútour guide‚Äù her fathers best friend (since childhood) greets them. As he is walking them to there apartment, the one his family conveniently lives in too which makes sense since he was the one who notified her father of the new available unit, she can‚Äôt stop staring at one of the balcony‚Äôs in the building opposite to her. Her father‚Äôs best friend notices and stops walking ‚ÄúYou have a good eye kid. Did you know there was a murder that took place in there? A vicious one at that. Knew the wife very well, kind lady and her kids just the cutest. Last year their bodies were discovered inside. The police haven‚Äôt made any arrests and are still investigating. Rumour has it, the father was the one who did it after learning of the wife‚Äôs ongoing affair, with get this, a top military official.‚Äù. The girl grows uneasy by his comment because the reason why she was so fixated on that unit was because there was a blurry black smoke cloud on the balcony and she sees the exact same thing on many balconies in that appartement and on many other apartments in the complex. 

They‚Äôve reached there new apartment and settle in before being invited to the ‚Äútour guides‚Äù apartment. There she mets a boy that resembles ross lynch and the same age as her. They naturally hang out during the get together and surprisingly have many things in common.

Later on in the story the girl and the boy become the best of friends and she learns that she can sense when bad things happened but isn‚Äôt given any context to what it was or when it happened, just a black blurry smoke cloud that fills the room when the catalyst of the bad thing happening (the culprit) is in the area for a while but disappears after they‚Äôve left for a degree of time. The boy learns he can see 10 seconds into the future of an area when he concentrates on it for awhile, however, he cannot see into the past. 

They don‚Äôt fall in love there‚Äôs just really good friends and they go around the apartment complex exploring different black blurry smoke cloud filled areas.

Down the line in the story, a new family moves in and the biggest of all black blurry smoke clouds in gulfs the unit. The new family consists of a husband (stay at home, was a police investigator but retired now), a wife (owns a successful local coffee shop, has workers so she hardly visits the shop), an oldest daughter (mid 30s, has a career just unable to move out due to the economy, works in a hybrid work environment) and younger daughter (student, mid 20s). The boy can only use his ability 3 times on an area. The first time he sees nothing bad happening in the future. The second time he gets the same results. 

Turns out one person in that household is a dormant notorious serial killer wanted in many cities across the country. All the of the bad things happening were in the past as the serial killer has gone quiet not killing anymore (they‚Äôre wanted in many,many cities). The husband even worked on that case when he was a police investigator and it was apart of the reason why he ended up retiring.  

Who was the serial killer? How did they find out? and then i woke up. They eventually did find out. I think they both ended up together after the series ended as a scene into the future. ",2,1731857496.0,webtoons,0,1.0,False

I'm a busy college student in southern Ohio, feeling pretty lonely and just overall seeking a really good connection with someone! Like, REALLY good connection, I'm practically trying to find myself in another person :'D

I'm ultimately looking for my bestfriend, my ride or die, my soulmate, someone that just absolutely gets me, and I get them, you know?

Anywayyyy, here's a bit about myself!:

I'm a trans guy, I've been on testosterone for almost 4 years now and had top surgery! I'm also queer! I'm short, and I like to dress in an 80's / granola boy aesthetic! 

I'm really into nature, like REALLY into nature. I've kinda struggled with religion my whole life, but recently I've been connecting more with the fact that I have a strong connection to nature and everything in the universe, which maybe sounds dumb? But nature really gives me a lot of comfort, and I feel connected to everything which is so great- but also it HURTS to see how badly our planet is being treated :') I'm really passionate about the climate crisis and environmental protection!

People say I've got golden retriever energy, I get hyper and really excited sometimes, I love going on walks, receiving affection, and I also say the most random stuff, like I have no filter, but I've been told I'm funny because of it :3

I do have ADHD which makes me extra silly, and I also have anxiety that I manage pretty well :D

Some things I like are: drinking tea every morning with my breakfast, procrastinating school stuff by taking a nap on occasion, the journey across campus for a sweet treat, autumn, rustic/nature/cabin aesthetics, listening to music 24/7 to make the world around me much less scary, anddddd getting attention!

Okay sorry LOL some more conventional things I like are going on walks/hikes, video games, shows/movies (currently watching Beastars!), reading, Wikipedia rabbit holes, true crime (like the interviews on the YT channel EXPLORE WITH US), pinterest, anddd recently I've started getting into pokemon cards! :3 I currently just open virtual packs using Pok√©mon TCG Pocket because I'm broke currently LMFAO but I want to start collecting physical cards very soon >:3

Also, you could also say I'm a furry I guess? I mostly just like the art and silly little fursona drawings, and I chronically use :3 

I don't really want kids, and I dream of one day living in either Oregon or Washington, just somewhere in a blue state where I can keep my rights lol and also be close to a lot of forests and nature to explore!! My dream home is something rustic and durable, while also owning land to grow my own vegetables and be self sustaining in this INSANE world- (maybe unrealistic goal? but that's what a dream home is for!) Also, I really want a golden retriever :D

Phew! If you've read all that and you're still here, here's what I'm looking for!

I'm basically looking for someone really similar to me who I can connect with, talk about literally anything with, text, call, hangout with, play video games, watch movies, explore nature, get coffee or food with, etc. literally whatever! I wanna mutually rant about climate change and the devastating political situation of the country and controversial topics that we both share the same opinions on and just all the stuff like that! 

Hopefully you'd be patient, sweet, funny, gentle, not insane, actually able to text and communicate properly as if it's a conversation instead of that really painful dry texting that feels like I'm texting a robot üò≠üò≠ also like.. I hope you smell really good and also like having a clean space, because I CANNOT deal with super messy or gross spaces or bad smells- I've got a really sensitive nose :'D

Aside from that, I figure the right person will just magically find me üôè (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU)

SO! If you felt like you really related and connected with what I've written, send me a chat with an introduction of yourself and who you are as a person!! I'll be here :3",1,1731857452.0,r4r,1,0.67,False
1gtfzd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1gtfzd0/wow_zep_really_works_broke_coffee_dependence_too/,WOW! Zep really works! Broke coffee dependence too. ,"I'm down 26 pounds since I started in late August. I'm so impressed with Zepbound. It truly has removed my constant desire too eat. My experience has been great so far. I lost 20 lbs on the first two months of 2.5 and 5.0 then stalled for a whole  month on the 7.5 dose. But now after the first week on 10mg I'm losing again. (The 10 is strong and I can feel it more. I did feel nauseous for a few days but think that is levelling off now).
So if anyone is getting down about their weight  loss plateauing, or is stalled on 7.5., keep going! I actually believe I can get back to my ideal weight within a year. 
Fantastic! 
Have a great day everyone! 
Also - Did anyone else find they don't like coffee anymore? I used to drink 6 cups a day - light and sweet. Now, I have a cup sometimes if I want it, but have broken my dependence on coffee completely. Which is great cause I'm not taking in all that sugar and creamer every day. Curious to know if anyone else experienced the same.

Support said I had a crap grinder and I needed something a lot better. To test that theory I went to the local coffee shop where they had very expensive grinders and brought home a ground bag. The group head inconsistently would pressurize but not usually to where it should. The only way I can pull appropriate pressure is on manual and using espresso filters. And even though it‚Äôs not great. 

I feel like my tamp is more than adequate. I still don‚Äôt get great pressure with the expensive high end grind. Do I have a faulty machine? Also just of note my pressure gauge had condensation in it a couple times after brewing.

The old tent he inherited from his childhood left us absolutely soaked one morning from rain. We are both fairly tall, him 6‚Äô2 and me 5‚Äô9 so space is a must. We are currently eyeing up TNF Wawona 6, but I am hesitant based off conflicting reviews. 

Things on our ‚Äòdream tent‚Äô list if it helps with recommendations: 

1: waterproof. (Rain fly that goes to the ground would be nice) 
2: vestibule. (Nice to store extra stuff or firewood out of the rain)
3: high interior height where we can both stand and change with enough space inside the actual tent to put our clothing bags etc.
5. Lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. My partner is a rough boy and a zipper getting caught and ripping the fabric is a fear of mine. And no option to repair or replace is also a worry. 
6: sturdy construction and material. As said before, the partner is rough, not careless by any means but him sleepy before coffee is enough cause for concern to consider a concrete tent lol. 
7: footprint available to purchase or one that comes with. The wawona 6 footprint is constantly out of stock (I do know of other brands that would fit those dimensions but those tend to also be out of stock) 

Things we don‚Äôt care about: 

1: weight. We have a truck and primarily do car camping so gear weight is not an issue. 
2: set up complexity. We both love a challenge so if it‚Äôs a difficult tent to set up we won‚Äôt mind, we do tent set up during the early afternoons, so plenty of daylight. 
3: colour of tent. (I‚Äôd like it to be a fun colour but put quality above aesthetic every time) 
4: hanging storage options. In my experience anything that hangs off of wall tents just causes more wear and tear over time and it‚Äôs more convenient to have stuff neatly packed in a suitcase than dangling. 
5: ventilation. It‚Äôs easy enough to open the vestibule to let airflow in, or unzip the waterproof door section to let the mesh sections create airflow etc. 
6: price. We would like to get something on sale, as anyone would. But we are willing to spend what is needed to get a quality tent that will last!

Originally from Minnesota (brr ü•∂), I relocated to Florida about a year ago. I started off in Clearwater working as a server, but when the restaurant I worked at closed, I decided to try out farm life. The farm I‚Äôm at now is preparing for sale, so it‚Äôs time for me to find a new place.


I‚Äôm specifically looking for a room in Pasco County since it offers a bit of a rural feel but is still close to Clearwater, where I have family as well as the beach and work opportunities. I have a friendly, people-loving tabby cat who will be coming with me. At home, I tend to be pretty quiet. I enjoy going to the library, watching Netflix, listening to podcasts, journaling, taking naps, spending time at the beach, and participating in local meetups like meditation groups or art classes.

I'll be in the area for Thanksgiving so if anyone wants to get coffee, send me a message introducing yourself. Thanks!

‚Ä¢ replaced non-stick cookware that seems to constantly need replacing with cast iron and stainless steel that will basically last a lifetime with good care 

‚Ä¢ also made the switch from plastic cutting boards and cooking utensils to wooden ones ‚Äî not sure about the comparative longevity of the boards (probably similar i would think) but wooden utensils i think should last better than plastic 

‚Ä¢ switched from a keurig to an insulated stainless steel french press; less plastic waste, and i can store a lot more ground or whole bean coffee than i can k cups

‚Ä¢ also switched to insulated mugs so coffee doesn‚Äôt go cold as quickly and end up going to waste 

‚Ä¢ found a really good deal on some high-quality knives and got a sharpener, so again with good care these shouldn‚Äôt need to be replaced for a long while 

‚Ä¢ got a good water filter and some stainless steel water bottles; no more buying disposable bottles when on the go 

‚Ä¢ switched to bar soap for the shower; no more plastic bottles, and these are so much smaller if you want to stock up on a few 

‚Ä¢ this one is still a work in progress, but buying clothes more thoughtfully (especially shoes and outwear); items of good quality that are versatile and not overly trendy

there are also some additional things i‚Äôve been thinking about, but haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet:

‚Ä¢ bar shampoo!

‚Ä¢ tablets or maybe bar format for dish soap 

‚Ä¢ a dish brush, or something less disposable than sponges 

‚Ä¢ swedish dish cloths, or some other alternative for paper towels

‚Ä¢ cleaning products; i could definitely be more diy with vinegar and baking soda type solutions, but will need to do some more research 

‚Ä¢ higher quality bedsheets, because the cheap ones i have from target are about to disintegrate 

‚Ä¢ making a better effort to care for the clothes i do have; handwashing delicates, air drying when possible, learning some basic mending, polishing and maintaining my shoes 

obviously these are not all super easy or cheap changes to make, and going out and buying all kinds of new stuff kind of defeats the purpose ‚Äî but a little at a time as your old stuff needs replacing is a good way to go about it. i started by looking around at where i was producing the most waste (k cups x.x) and making a change there. if anyone has any other thoughts or ideas, feel free to share!

Help with cream thickening.,"Last night I went and tried making Tirimasu which is an Italian coffee dessert made from Lady fingers dipped in expresso, covred in layers of cream and sprinkled with coca powder.

It was decent, but the presentation could be a bit better, because I had troubles trying to make the cream to come out thick. I follow the instructions online and it says I need about 5 egg yolks and whites separated in each bowl ü•£ and with a sauce pan, I needed to let the water in the stove come to a boil and simmer and whisk the yolk over the pan and put the sugar to dissolve to allow the custard to form. The problem was, it wouldn't thicken so I attempted to add flour and corn starch to thicken and it came out ok. I went and used cottage cheese üßÄ in the mixing bowl, because I didn't had mascarpone, since it was out of stock at Wal-Mart, and I was wondering if that may be the reason that the cream wasn't thick, because real authentic Tiramisu I heard needed mascarpone cheese instead. 

So then I proceed to put in all in the baking tray and everything all together, left it overnight and it didn't came out hard or frosty as I would like it too. The cream was soft and melty. 

Oh well. It was my first attempt so no shame in that, and it was still good but would like the presentation to be better. What suggestions for those who are experts in Italian cuisines suggest me to do? I would appreciate it.",0,1731856612.0,Cooking,1,0.5,False

1gtfi20,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1gtfi20/i_once_had_a_dream/,I once had a dream,"I would be leisurely drinking my morning coffee while I stand on the countertop. I stared blankly at the white walls, with three lone flowers hanging individually on their own frames. A yellow drape framed my windows with a view of the lawn outside. My eyes darted across the living room, where a white, round coffee table stands in the middle, adorned with a single cactus on top of it. The white sofa, with yellow, pink, and blue throw pillows, faces the window. 

And the room changes. Where there used to be flowers hanging on walls, faces surface and replace them. I have my own family.

I wake up from my daydream. Here I am. Unemployed. With no purpose nor sense of direction. Still living in my parents‚Äô house. Single. The only thing I can habitually fulfill in my dream is the part where I‚Äôm drinking coffee.

I am, for the most part, aware that it would be best for me not to have my own family in the future. I have an incurable mental illness after all. Think of Van Gogh. 

I would always wonder, had I been spared from this mental illness, would my dreams come true? 

At times like this, when I am beset with grief for the person I will never become and the dreams I could never realize, Desiderata would come to mind.

1gtfhyd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtfhyd,Monkeypod acacia cutoffs ,"Ok‚Ä¶I know some don‚Äôt have this issue since they have the space. But I recently move back to the east coast from Guam and was lucky enough to acquire a bunch of monkeypod acacia slabs. It was peak pandemic there, work was very difficult, and I picked up woodworking as a hobby. I made a 9‚Äô dining table, multiple chairs, coffee table, and whiskey cabinet with the slabs. I still have 2-8‚Äô slabs destined to be a hope chest and blanket chest. 

In the process of making furniture, I‚Äôve hoarded a lot of cutoffs which I just can‚Äôt bring myself to throw away or burn. They‚Äôre weird grain patterns and rough cut. I fantasize about the perfect project that will need these cutoffs or the crazy projects I could do to make these pieces useful, but with our 3rd kid on the way‚Ä¶my wife is nesting HARD. She sees the garage and notices all the ‚Äúscraps‚Äù I‚Äôm hoarding and is gently requesting I consolidate. I think this was exacerbated by her discovery of the scraps hidden in the shed‚Ä¶ 

The more furniture I make, the more I realize grain direction matters. These smaller pieces are difficult to use beyond making small boxes and maybe picture frames? Yes, End grain cutting boards which I‚Äôm trying to make with some of the straight grain blocks. But are single species end grain boards interesting? Worth the glue up? I don‚Äôt have a lathe and I‚Äôm not trying to invest MORE into making scraps useful.

1gtfdg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gtfdg1/ode_2_grinder_zero_adjustment_dont_do_what_i_did/,Ode 2 Grinder Zero Adjustment - don't do what i did.,"As part of my deep dive into co-ferments and experimental processing, I opened a bag of September Buttercream.  First cup, I immediately got the Cinnamon and cardamom.  But it felt a little thin.  More bright acidity than I was hoping, with less sweetness.  



I started to dial it in and write up a post for the weekly thread, but then decided *'If I‚Äôm going to share my thoughts with people, I need to calibrate my Ode 2.'*  And I decided to do this at 3:30 am after waking up super early!

I knew it was off - apparently was 5 clicks.  Maybe 6.  But the math in my head was off too, so I adjusted my recipes the wrong direction - meaning my starting point was now 10 clicks off!



I started getting frustrated by the excessive fines and muddy flavors, fearing I somehow screwed something up on the grinder.  Maybe that 'chirp"" was worse than I thought!  I was also a little biased because my first Ode failed immediately - so I trusted myself more than the grinder.  It had to be the source of the problem, right?

To make it worse, I was wasting beans in the process. And I was a little low on sleep.



So I grabbed the bag of Counter Culture out of the cabinet I have on hand for regular coffee drinkers at four in the afternoon, and started grinding small batches and laying them on a paper towel. My wife walks in and asks ""More Coffee!?""  Then pauses and says - ""oh, more playing with the grinder...."" and walks back out of the kitchen.



It‚Äôs kind of astounding that across the entire grind range of 5 full steps (15 clicks) I‚Äôve used, the overall appearance isn‚Äôt immediately obvious to my older eyes.  :).  As I spread the grounds out (and put my reading glasses on), the particle size distribution became apparent, and I could clearly see which one had a lot of fines, and that the other didn't.  

I finally realized I had gone the wrong way with my adjustment offset to the recipes in my head.  I needed to go higher instead of lower.  So my old ‚Äú4‚Äù was now 5.2 (not 2.1), and my old ‚Äú5.2‚Äù would be 7.1 instead of 4!  



Amazing how you get confident in some decisions and assumptions.   But I had done that very basic math in the early morning on 4 hours sleep, and just took it as correct. It's also a metaphor for the chase of the perfect cup for me.  Ultimately what worked best?  My most basic, reliable switch recipe.  Once the grinder was set correctly, of course. Had I not changed ANYTHING and just rested the coffee for 4 more days, I'd be in the same spot with more coffee to enjoy.



So anyway, now that the Buttercream is back on track, it‚Äôs solid.  But not mind-blowing.  Really struggling to get the sweetness I would expect (or maybe hoped).  I‚Äôve seen other folks say 4 weeks or later, so I‚Äôll give it another week and come back to it. (it was roasted 10/29).

  
i also stopped using TWW while chasing the problem, and got some really good brews on tap water with both Counter Culture Hologram and Buttercream.  So now I'm back to questioning how much better my cups truly are with TWW vs my tap.  



And since I ran through a lot of the Buttercream, the Dak Coco Bongo is now in the rotation, and I ordered a Hop co-ferment and a 120-hour Wush Wush from a semi-local small roaster : [Brainwaves in Philly](https://brainwaveroasters.com/).  

  
But I've still got 5 or 6 freshly roasted bags in-house already.  Time to start considering what will be going in the freezer...

Our whole relationship he would tell me he loved me and how we‚Äôd get married and how we would never break up. But when boyfriend began varsity sports team, fights that would brew towards the early part of our relationship that I thought we got over came up again. Then ex-boyfriend decided to end the relationship. 

Next day I received a message for him to ask me to talk. Where he basically tells me he wants to be with me and loves me so much but just doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt date right now and ask for a break. I ask if after this break will ex-boyfriend and I be ok and things be better and he says idk. Me not being able to wait 20 days for nothing to change decides to just end it with him. We agreed to be friends due to how we both couldn‚Äôt imagine not having the other in their life.

He later tells me how he has a plan and after high school when all the stupid ‚Äúteenage bullshit‚Äù is gone he‚Äôll invite me out for coffee and we‚Äôll get back together. And how we‚Äôre still going to get married. He also said how he doesn‚Äôt want me to ever move on and to wait for him, and how he‚Äôd always wait for me. 

Later that day a mutual friend tells me that he was flirting with another girl 5 min after breaking up. So obviously I confront him and ask if he was really doing that and he said yes he was but it was for a minute and it was only to get rid of the pain of loosing me. Time goes by and I decided to forgive him and we get closer. He asks for a relationship where we can still do all the couple things but not have a label. Me missing the hugs and kisses but not him really agrees. 

We create rules like when someone begins talking to another person we stop or when someone gets another significant other we‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs when he said then I guess I‚Äôll never get a girlfriend, and I hope you don‚Äôt get a boyfriend. Then later he ends up changing saying that what we do in high school  doesn‚Äôt matter and we can date other people but we just need to make sure we come back to each other. 

Now we‚Äôre at 3 weeks after breakup, and guy who rides my bus (18) M has been talking to me and we‚Äôve been having fun. Me wanting to be faithful to the guy if we begin talking call ex-boyfriend(17) M and inform him that we‚Äôve been flirting and that we might start talking. I make sure to inform him we‚Äôre not talking yet and I am really confused because I‚Äôm not over him yet. He proceeds to hang up the phone and block me. I get his friend to later unblock me and he‚Äôs mad that I got a ‚Äúnew bf‚Äù even though that‚Äôs not true. So am I the asshole for moving on from my ex-boyfriend even though he told me too? 

I feel like I might be the asshole due to how he still loves me and I still love him, and how he wants me to wait/doesn‚Äôt at the same time. I might also be the asshole because I did tell him I‚Äôd wait originally before he said to find other people. I know it definitely hurt and caused him a lot of pain and I didn‚Äôt mean to do that, friends say I shouldn‚Äôt have given him false hope but I don‚Äôt think I did. But I can‚Äôt keep going back and forth because he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants. But he‚Äôs still my bestfriend and it hurts not being able to talk to him and be friends.

Whether you‚Äôre buying a mansion, donating to charity, or investing in stocks, the cost isn‚Äôt just financial‚Äîit‚Äôs time off your lifespan.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
	‚Ä¢	The year is deducted the moment you make the purchase, so spending recklessly could shorten your life dramatically.
	‚Ä¢	Smaller purchases won‚Äôt affect your lifespan unless they add up to $1 million or more. For example, buying a coffee won‚Äôt hurt you, but splurging on luxury cars or properties will.
	‚Ä¢	You can‚Äôt predict how many years you have left, so every million spent is a gamble.

The twist? You can‚Äôt tell anyone about the deal. Friends and family will see your lavish lifestyle or sudden frugality but will never know the true stakes. If they ask, you‚Äôll need to claim it‚Äôs just personal budgeting or newfound wealth.

The money is yours to spend however you like, but the more you indulge, the shorter your time. Could you manage your spending and balance your life for $70 million?",1,1731855231.0,Amazingscenarios,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs just say, their rendition of ‚ÄúUnder the Sea‚Äù left ***quite*** the impression!

They started me on 250mg of acetazolamide immediately and I got discharged 6 hours after my tap. Friday and Saturday were pretty rough recovery days but I noticed the past two nights I‚Äôve been getting FULL nights of sleep. FULL. Even on days I‚Äôve had coffee at 5pm the night before for some post LP headaches. I woke up yesterday morning at 11:30am and I assumed I was just exhausted from my stay in the hospital, which I mean I definitely was. This morning I woke up at 8:30am which feels just normal and appropriate. Normal?! Me?! 

Prior to my tap and diagnosis I was waking up every morning at 3:30am (without vision within in the recent week) and some nights couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep until 5:30/6am. I can‚Äôt remember a time within the last year that I haven‚Äôt woken up around 3am-5am, and most importantly I don‚Äôt wake up with head neck and shoulder pain, and I haven‚Äôt lost my vision since! It‚Äôs a feeling I‚Äôve gotten so used to that it became my normal. 

I don‚Äôt want to jump the gun because I still have a long road ahead of me in this treatment, and need a stent but I‚Äôm feeling a lot of relief. Now I finally have an angel to attack this by and return some normalcy to my life. That feels reassuring. I‚Äôll deal with the little random feet and hand tingles if it means I get to sleep through the night and wake up without pain. And the zaps I get in my gooch? Fine. It adds to my lore. Amazing for the plot. 

I would love if you guys could share your positive quality of life changes since your diagnosis/treatment. Maybe especially post stent so I know what to expect? I know recovery post stent will be long but what‚Äôs been your life like months to years after the insertion?

It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren‚Äôt even in my region. It‚Äôs practically heaven on Earth!



But let‚Äôs delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don‚Äôt give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn‚Äôt even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I‚Äôm getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn‚Äôt the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn‚Äôt on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn‚Äôt do you any good to have access to all these games if you can‚Äôt see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your internet can handle it, anyway. But don‚Äôt worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I‚Äôve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn‚Äôt have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what‚Äôs the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything‚Äôs buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don‚Äôt have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn‚Äôt have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I‚Äôve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

Generally, I didn't think about them & didn't get symptoms unless I forgot to take them. I've been in a bad flare since about September and have drastically changed my diet (strict Acid Watchers for 2 weeks, but cut coffee, tomatoes, spicy, alcohol maybe 6 weeks ago). I have noticed recently if I take my PPI as instructed first thing in the morning and wait an hour before eating my symptoms often start within that hour and don't stop when I eat breakfast (usually oatmeal). Whereas I've tried a few days delaying my PPI until late afternoon and have had fewer symptoms at least for a few days in a row, until something (usually stress/ sleep related triggers another flare).

I'm nervous to try weaning from the PPI, although I suspect they're not doing a ton, in part because I'm scheduled for a major surgery (unrelated to GERD) in December and I don't want to induce too many big body systems changes at once. 

Have other people noticed PPIs stop working during flare-up? Or played with timing or frequency?",1,1731854554.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Many of us will be traveling home next week, myself included.. just stumped trying to come up with a decent gift (its not required, just feels awkward to arrive empty handed). I don't want to offend diets by bringing like a pizza or chicago dogs or Italian beef or something (or ruin the illusion abt deep dish) and its not even that creative. And I thought one of those mini replicas of The Bean would be cool, but might get stuffed in a closet if it clashes with other decor. 

Any ideas of what to bring back for a transplants first holiday return home? Prefer something unique to the city. Price range is irrelevant, as a suggestion might not be suitable for me, particularly, but others with a similar question might enjoy! This is especially useful if you have family that have never visited the city or just dont travel much or can only ever make it here every once in a blue moon.

Maybe a frozen baked good to enjoy with the Thanksgiving meal? A one of a kind piece by a local artist? A bag of whole beans from one of our many coffee shops? Something to use? Something to wear? A bottle of something, like Malort? Are there any ornaments of the infamous rat hole or poop sculpture? Maybe a tote or book from one of the museums?

If you live near the area, and have been to this little gem of a shop; perhaps you can help me figure it out. I know the store has lots and lots of products that may be contributing to what I‚Äôm smelling overall. I thought maybe I‚Äôd be able to simplify it though and try to come close with a handful of key scents. If anyone wants to weigh in, I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. üòä Thanks

Anyway, my problem is once I turn off the machine by pressing the water button for 4 seconds, I can see the ""off"" information on the display which stays there for next 15-30 minutes and then the machine just turns back on automatically - is this behavior intended? It doesn't make much sense to me, why would it turn on automatically once you turn it off, especially that manual says to turn the machine on you have to press the button again for 4 seconds.

Now the only option to really turn off the machine is to go into ""off"" mode and just press the button in the back to off (or just switch the button without going into ""off"" mode, but not sure if that's ok). I've read the manual several times and watched their [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJAFHmaYDcM&t) but there is nothing about it. Also, there is the setting in the menu called ""F"", which has two possible values: 1.0 - FW power version and 1.2 - FW display version but again - there is no information on what this setting does in the manual, this preset is also skipped in the tutorial video for some reason, maybe it is somehow related to the issue with the machine turning back on automatically?

Lastly, this might be just me panicking, but I was so focused on reading manual when I was setting up the machine for the first time that I forgot to put the water tank inside the machine before turning it on ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Literally I filled it with water and put next to the machine instead of putting it inside (lack of the morning coffee didn't help either üòÇ). I turned the machine on for just 4-5 seconds, it operated pretty loud for these few seconds because the pump couldn't get any water and I stopped the process - could it possibly do any harm to the machine?

1gtehsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gtehsx/human_shop/,Human Shop,"Cold. Calculating. Ruthless. Perfection. Put all these traits together to get the Ecievet Deathsquads, the galaxy's most powerful mercenary soldiers from Krukov-12. Capable of killing something or someone, conquering planets and stations alike, and cause chaos with documented proof of their kill on every mission to guarantee their employers. These deathsquads can do all for the right price.

""Everything has been accounted for Major. We just placed down our monthly deposit and have paid extra to the landlord to keep things hush on his end."" Lieutenant E'liesha, 2nd-in-Command of the 34-I Platoon, walked towards her commander, Major A'zaeel, her slit eyes locked onto the Ecievet in front of her, saluting with dignity and grace. The latter removed his cloak, revealing skin that littered black inks of art, placing his beret on his head before looking back at his accomplice.

""Good. Our first phase is complete. Assemble our men."" He snarled, smiling from ear to ear as his skin wrinkled along with his satisfied expression.

Not long after, within the small confines of their rented space, the proud 12 members of the 34-I squadron stand in guard, their posture composed, their blank expressions alone could kill a deadly Throonak with a single gaze. In front of each soldier contains the necessary equipment vital to their mission.

""ATEEEEEEENTION!"" Lieutenant E'liesha shouted with a boom in her voice. ""Major wants all ears.""

""Thank you, Lieutenant. As all of you know, we have been tasked by Command to initiate a Code: Blue Operation. Which means, we have targets."" The Major walked and stood right in front of his proud squad.

Snapping his right fingers, the registry of his command unsealed the boxes, the vacuum seal breaking in a hissing sound, before raising his right hand in a flicking motion to let them open the boxes without any repercussions.

""Within these boxes and the rest that we have stocked in a private storage facility that you can find in your dossier are equipment and ingredients for our mission."" He used his foot to lift the trunk open, before pulling out a black and yellow pouch labeled CAF-24. ""This, along with TB-21 and CSC-27 will be used to lay waste to the human population on this planet.""

The soldiers turned their heads around and kneeled in synchronized motion, with some pulling out a few metal containers, porcelain, and machines as their facial expressions still blank.

""Each and every one of you will be assigned into teams according to the boxes. To those who have only ingredients in your trunks, you are tasked with manning the kitchen and storage. You will be Team A."" The Major walked around, seeing his comrades slowly and surely place their assigned tools in a neat order.

""To those who have the specialized equipment, coordinate with Team A and use these pieces of equipment to create our bio-weapons. You will be Team B."" He turned around once again, his back turned on his squad as he walked back to his position.

""And lastly. To those who have the porcelains and trays. You will be tasked with the most important assignment and will be Team C. Yes. You lucky bastards will be the ones who will give out these bioweapons to the humans."" He smirked as he turned around once again, his tattoed skin wrinkled once again, showing off his fangs as he faced his men once more.

""Command has already prepared us documents and certificates to easily disguise ourselves. We have been given 2 weeks to make sure everything has been prepped. In those 2 weeks, we are to get this place into tip-top shape. If possible human interaction or accidents, refer to your dossier. Am I understood?""

""**SIR YES SIR**!"" Every soldier stood, Major's spine stood on edge with pleasure as satisfaction relished within him.

""Alright. Dismissed. Start on working immediately.""

\*\*\*

""Can I have a triple-shot of this 'Battlebuster' in a 22-ounce cup? Am I saying it right? Oh! With less sugar! I don't want my daughter here to go on a sugar high."" The eyes of every Ecievet opened wide when they all heard the human's words. This was supposed to be their first victims‚Äîthe first kill of their operation.

To think this human asked for triple the dose of their TB-21 is insane! To a youngling even! They have seen how the bio-weapon works. Just even a few grams of TB-21 can liquify a Yoel High-Warrior's insides in a matter of seconds.

""Uh. Ma'am. Are sure you would like anything else?"" Major A'zaeel held onto his databoard, his hands gripped tightly on the counter desk as he looked back at the human and her spawn. Though kept composed with a smile on his face, deep down, he was shaking like a little kit.

What followed shook him to the core.

""Oh, why the hell not? I would also like your 'White Death' and 2 pieces of your Rialc√®. They do look good."" The Major swore he could drop his legs right then and there. How could the human smile in front of him while asking for a cup of CAF-24 laced with CSC-27 and two pieces of pastry filled to the brim with concentrated TB-21?

""S-sure. We will have it right at your preferred table of choice, but we do recommend sitting on the leather couches....for your youngling."" He smiled once again, showing his fangs, his wrinkled skin moved lightly, causing the child to laugh with pleasure.

""Thank you, young gentlebeing.""

The moment the human and her youngling sat down on one of the 5 leather couches to wait for their order, the Major turned and walked towards the kitchen with Lieutenant E'liesha following suit. The moment the doors closed to seal the gap between them and the humans, his composure cracked.

""Of all cycles that I served the Ecievet Army. This. **THIS!** Has to be the most inconceivable thing that I have ever witnessed."" The Major turned around to look at his 2nd-in-Command, who in turn got shaken and stopped in her tracks.

""Sir, with everything the human has ordered, at least they are gonna give us a good show. We have our cleaning crew on standby when it happens."" She had gone back to her stoic expression, though her get-up as a service crew that she had researched on the Galaxynet beforehand did little to no favor in keeping her aura less gloomy. The Major, on the other hand, went silent.

""Should we let someone from Team C give the order?"" She asked again, causing the Major to snap out of fantasy before coming back down, shaking his head and his ears raising once again.

""No. Ready the Hazmat, Lieutenant. And the data recorder."" He replied with a low voice, a growl on his throat as he grabbed the rubberized gloves from his pocket.

With a uniform change and the order ready for a few minutes later, they slowly walked toward the human with pride in their stride. Each step echoed throughout the room, their faces blank through it all as they were ready to initiate their first kill. Their first slay before the rest.

""One White Death, One Battlebuster with less sugar, and two Rialc√® with extra cream on the house."" The Major smiled once more, with the tray of their order placed on the table in front of their prey.

""What's the suit?"" The human asked while the human child stared in awe at their costumes before staring back toward the Rialc√® that glistened against the bright light of their establishment.

""This is standard procedure Maam. Our meals and drinks served at this establishment are simply to *die for*. Hence, this get-up."" He chuckled, before removing each item from the service plate, handing over the white mug containing their hot CAF-24, laced with CSC-27 to the human, the ice-cold TB-21 to the youngling, and the concentrated TB-21 pastry right between them both.

""Wow. This looks great. Say 'Thank you' to the kind man baby."" The human smiled once more, her head looking down towards her child before nudging her spawn to say grace.

""THANK YOU MISTAH CATMAN!"" The spawn smiled as he showed his teeth, although missing one of its upper lateral incisors, the Major and his 2nd-in-Command swore they could have seen the spawn spewing a rainbow in their smile.

""Why thank you little one. Now before you two dig in, we would like to have a photograph taken of you both for Posterity."" The Major chuckled before nudging Lieutenant E'liesha to come closer with the Data Recorder. The human laughed in turn before raising her hands to grab the Ecievet down to her level gently.

""Only if you join us! We didn't know we were your first customers!"" With a boom of her voice, she scooted closer to the wall beside her to make room for the Major.

""I-I don't think that's necessary maam-""

""I insist!"" The human interjected the Major's words before the latter admitted defeat. Oh well, at least the Major could brag about his first human kill. He removed his Hazmat Helmet before bending his knees slightly to stand on their level while looking towards his Lieutenant who was holding the data recorder right in front of him and the humans beside him.

""Okay. Ready? Say 'Ecievet'!"" She chuckled, waiting for their prey and their Major to respond, her uniform slightly crinkled as she bent her back slightly to take the photo perfectly.

""**ECIEVET!**"" And with that, a bright flash of light shines on the humans and her Major, taking the first photo of 34-I Platoon's kill.

\*\*\*

In Oxrilve-114, home of 80 billion lifeforms, with the human demographic around 13.7 billion and counting, full of life and happiness, lies a cafe catered only for humans in the Capital. This cafe, once a small business located in a tiny corner of the hustle and bustle of the city, now caters to almost 400 million human customers per day with the help of their 200,000 store branches spread all over and rising. There are even talks of going Galactic, ready to tackle new heights and new opportunities to spread their products that humans say are to die for, throughout the rest of the humans in the known universe.

With the help of their Chairman and CEO, A'zaeel, along with his COO, E'liesha, once proud members of the 34-I Ecievet Deathsquad Platoon, now leading the multinational company with a net profit of 8.4 trillion credits annually and rising, soon to be a multigalactic company proudly named 'Ecievet Cafe of Sin' with the slogan: '***It's simply to die for!***'.

With every single staff member of their company being a former Ecievet Deathsquad Soldier, with the exception of their taste testers, they use perfected, calculated, ruthless methods to chemically engineer their Caffeine, Chocolate, and Chili products to sell with the help of their powerful, cold-hearted, expressions of their staff towards the human demographic. Here we have a few reviews and ratings of their service and products taken from some human customers.

* The cafe is *soooo* war-eccentric, especially their products! I would love to eat their famous *Rialc√®* again. *9.5/10*
* Their *White Death* tastes so good, I love how the spiciness hits my throat the moment I drink it! *9.8/10*
* Dude, Cats serving coffee. Such cuteness of their anger, such love! *9.4/10*
* I recommend purchasing the Battlebusters taken in this order, Black, Red, White, Pink, and Black again for the maximum experience. *9.6/10*
* Got a commemorative scratch on my jacket! SO COOL! *9.7/10*
* The server of my table let my children pet his head when they took their hazmats off. Ngl, I got to touch the ears too! *9.7/10*
* They served me a free slice on my birthday! Lucky me! *10/10*

Each photo that every cafe chain takes for their humans is considered as their *kill*, such as birthdays, contests, being the first customer to purchase, and so on placed on their walls that look similar to an *Ecievet Kill Board*, to commemorate their achievements. A memory, if one insists.

There are still Ecievet Deathsquads still roaming the galaxy, terrorizing everyone in their path, but one thing is for sure. 

For the Ecievets to get a good-paying job and a cushy retirement by the time they are 60, all they have to do is open up a human shop.

And Ecievet Cafe of Sin will always be there to help them.",33,1731853045.0,HFY,5,1.0,False
1gteho8,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1gteho8/since_when_was_it_ok_to_leave_a_giant_unattended/,Since when was it ok to leave a giant unattended bag in central London while you go walkabout for half an hour?,"Was just in my local coffee shop on granary square and one of the very few tables was taken up by two giant bags. After about ten minutes watching people come in and not be able to sit down, I asked I the people at the adjoining table whom I assumed the bags belonged to to move them but they said the bags had been there when they‚Äôd sat down. The staff were unbothered, said they‚Äôd been there for 20 minutes but that whoever they belonged to had ‚Äòleft their coffee‚Äô. Being the conscientious Londoner that I am I expressed this was a bit concerning and decided to leave (not that there was anywhere to sit given the bags were taken up the only remaining table). At this point another customer got up to remove the bag from the premises when this completely non plussed woman strolls in, takes about 30 seconds too long to realise what‚Äôs happening and then starts screeching that that‚Äôs her bag and how she almost lost everything she owned. I pointed out she almost lost everything she owned when she left her bag unattended in a central London coffee shop while she went walkabout for half an hour. 

At this point another guy got involved who said he‚Äôd lived in London all his life, the IRA were a real thing etc etc and that we‚Äôd behaved properly in the scenario, but this stupid American woman would not get it and kept scoffing and sneering. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been to loads of cities in Europe and this has never been a problem before‚Äô. 

Since he was mediating and I was getting progressively more angry I left and went to ask one of the security guards outside what would have been the right thing to do (which I absolutely should have done first thing). He of course said that an unattended bag would mean calling control, turning off all radio equipment and implementing the whole massive protocol. 

I really wish I had gone straight to security so she could have seen what a fucking idiot she was being by expecting other people to be responsible for her belongings. ",444,1731853033.0,london,108,0.92,False

Hi I just wanna tell about my past ka talking stage/MU, last year kami nagkakilala sa isang site. I'm just 24 back then and she was 38, niligawan niya ako thru call and chats before we've met pinapadalan nya ako ng mga foods sa office and also the first and last bouquet na natanggap ko from her. February kami nagkakilala and March is our first meet up and also first date in Tagaytay, as a first timer to go on a date I don't really know what to do I just staring at her listen to her and observe her because I really don't know what to say actually. Sinundo niya ako near sa tinutuluyan kong apartment that time, and we went to Tagaytay her favorite place na never na naulit pa na magpunta kaming dalawa dun. 
Fast forward umuwi na kami nahatid na niya ako from my apartment and after an hour she called me and ask me if pwede na daw ba na maging kami, pero sinagot ko is parang masyado pang maaga para maging official na kami that time so I refuse and she ended the call and chat me that she was crying because she wanted us to become official, well yes my feelings for her that time was not that deep yet like I'm still in the process but I know that I like her. Sinabi ko sa kanya na hindi pa talaga ako ready if gusto niya humanap na sya ng iba pero still we continue communicating, I felt guilty din dahil nga di ko sya napagbigyan na maging kami na agad. 
One time, we've met again for the second time in a coffee shop kasi nagiguilty ako sa ginawa kong pag refuse and gusto ko lang mag sorry sana at bumawi pero di ganon yung nangyari it happened that she stole my first kiss I was shock because it was my first time be kiss on the lips. She told me she really likes and love me so much but I ask her if why she likes me and love me that fast? But there's no answer I heard.
Actually, sabi niya gusto niya kapag may nakakadate at nakakausap siya at gusto niya yung tao is i-lilive in na niya agad kasi mas makikilala daw niya yung tao sa ganong paraan. I don't know why I allowed myself to enter in a no label relationship kasi iba na din yung connection na nabibuild up namin sa isa't isa, not until one day bigla na lang sabi niya ayaw na nya, pagod na sya kasi daw parang feeling niya pinaghahabol ko siya sakin. And then sabi ko babawi ako and I did na bumawi sa lahat ng efforts niya actually more than pa dun kasi I even gave my whole self to her not just my whole heartedly genuine and pure love. In short siya yung first time ko sa lahat, parang bumaliktad yung mundo ako na yung parang naghahabol sa kanya kasi sobra na kong invested sa feelings ko sa kanya as in buong buo kong minamahal siya even now. 
Pero hindi pala sumasapat ang buong pusong pagmamahal na halos maubos ka na at wala ng matira para sa sarili, para lang mapag stay mo yung tao. Hindi pala ganon, umalis pa rin siya and last message niya sakin was saying na ""hindi ako naghanap, may dumating nagsabi naman ako sayo na gusto ko ng makakasama sa buhay at hindi yung young adult na hindi ko alam lung hanggang kailan ako maghihintay."" The reason na nasabi niya yun is before that I'm trying to fix us din like I ask that we can be official na ganyan pero she refused na and actually she's having a demand from me that time na if maglilive in kami kaya ko daw ba siya buhayin like kaya ko ba maibigay agad yung mga luho niya. Kasi lahat na ng gusto niya sabi ko gagawin ko magstay lang kami sa isa't isa pero hindi pa rin talaga. 
Grabe yung pinagdaanan ko after that para akong mababaliw pero kinakaya ko na labanan yung sakit  ng damdamin ko na iniwan niya sakin. Yung tipo na nasanay na lang ako na iniisip siya araw-araw kahit hanggang sa pagtulog habang siya naging masaya na sa piling ng iba. 
Fast forward ulit, June this year I went to Baguio and pagkauwi ko after ko makatulog I check my phone then sa fb may friend request of no mutuals of my fb friends and siya pala yun and dun na nagstart na magkausap kami ulit I thought she came back para makipagbalikan or just to try again kasi I'm still allowing her since she said nung okay pa kami ""if di tayo mag work ngayon maybe next year when we are both still single we can continue"" I'm holding on to that pero hindi pala. She needs someone na naiintindihan siya kasi she met someone else pero it died. So I comfort her thru chats, pero yun pala ang purpose kaya siya nagparamdam ulit kasi akala ko a chance na para saming dalawa, pero hindi pa rin pala. 
I gave a bouquet of her favorite flowers last August since it's her birth month then she ask me why, bakit ko daw siya binigyan nun for what daw so sabi ko mahal ko pa siya, gusto ko pa rin siya. Pero she said na I need to stop kasi wala daw syang feelings sakin, another heartbreaking moment of my life kasi kahit anong gawin ko mahal ko pa din talaga siya hanggang ngayon. Pero walang clear intentions from her kung ano ba yung gusto niya sakin like as a friend hindi ko maramdaman na ganon kami right now. Para siyang mushroom na bigla na lang susulpot at magmemessage sakin pero ako I still entertain her kasi sa ganong paraan masaya na ako dahil nakakausap ko pa din siya, I miss her so much as my lover, I miss her care so much like how she made me feel all the love languages that time I miss that moment that we still love each other. I always look back on that feelings and I forget all those not good happening between us. I'm actually hoping still na maging kami pa rin soon, like I'm at the point of my life right now kung hindi siya yung para sakin, huwag na lang because I wanted and needed my first to be my last love. Kasi ngayon I'm so ready to be with her without any hesitations cause I have my life she wanted me to be.

Crowley‚Äôs mood seemed to lift as they made their way to a section of the path that ran directly along the water‚Äôs edge. The shimmering surface of the lake under the bright sun and clear blue sky was certainly a dramatic enough tableau to improve anyone‚Äôs spirits. They chatted amiably as they ambled down a bit further and then all the way back up the path. Despite what he had said earlier, Crowley‚Äôs forehead was beaded with sweat and his pale skin flushed from the heat. He looked incredibly fetching. So fetching, in fact, that Aziraphale had to put his hands in his pockets to resist the urge to cup the back of his neck and kiss the pinked tips of his ears.


These tactile urges were a new kind of torture. Aziraphale had always been a sensualist, the type to pick up and examine, to touch and taste and smell, to indulge while he learned about the world around him. Crowley was by far the most fascinating thing in his world at that moment and yet he wasn‚Äôt allowed to explore the way he usually did. This situation wasn‚Äôt remotely fair.


He was so caught up in fretting that he walked straight into a lamppost before Crowley could stop him.
