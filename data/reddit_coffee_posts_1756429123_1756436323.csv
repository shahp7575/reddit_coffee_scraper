*Transform your daily routine from mindless scrolling to meaningful action*

---

## The Morning Question That Changes Everything ‚òÄÔ∏è

Picture this: You wake up tomorrow morning, grab your phone, and instead of asking ""What notifications do I have?"" you ask yourself ""What meaningful thing will I accomplish today?""

This simple shift in thinking can revolutionize how you experience each day. Most of us have been conditioned to chase comfort, entertainment, and instant gratification. But what if there's a better way to measure whether our day was truly worthwhile?

## The Pleasure Trap We All Fall Into üì±

We live in an age of endless distractions. Netflix shows that auto-play, social media feeds that never end, and streaming services competing for our attention 24/7. It's easier than ever to fill our days with activities that feel good in the moment but leave us feeling empty afterward.

Think about your last ""perfect lazy day."" You probably binged a series, ordered takeout, and scrolled through your phone for hours. How did you feel at the end of that day? Satisfied? Fulfilled? Or maybe a bit... hollow?

Here's the thing: pleasure is like sugar for the soul. It gives you a quick high, but it doesn't sustain you. And just like sugar, the more you consume, the more you need to feel the same level of satisfaction.

## The Purpose Alternative That Actually Works üöÄ

Now imagine a different kind of day. Maybe you spent three hours learning a new skill that frustrated you. Perhaps you helped a neighbor move furniture when you'd rather have stayed in bed. Or you worked on a project that challenged every fiber of your being.

These activities might have been harder, more demanding, even uncomfortable. But here's what's remarkable: at the end of such days, you feel genuinely satisfied. You sleep better. You wake up with energy. You feel like you're moving forward rather than just marking time.

## Why Our Brains Trick Us Into Choosing Easy üß†

Your brain is wired for survival, not success. It constantly pushes you toward the path of least resistance because, thousands of years ago, conserving energy meant staying alive. But in today's world, this ancient programming often works against us.

Every time you choose the easy option, you're reinforcing neural pathways that make future easy choices more likely. It's like creating a mental highway that leads straight to mediocrity.

Breaking this cycle requires conscious effort, but the payoff is enormous.

## The Daily Practice That Builds Character üí™

Start each morning by identifying one challenging but meaningful task. It doesn't have to be life-changing. Small purposeful actions compound over time:

**Personal Growth:**
- Read 20 pages of a challenging book instead of scrolling news
- Practice a skill that pushes your comfort zone
- Have a difficult but necessary conversation

**Contributing to Others:**
- Volunteer for an hour at a local organization
- Teach someone something you know well
- Help solve a problem in your community

**Building Something Lasting:**
- Work on a creative project that excites you
- Organize and improve your living space
- Develop a side business or valuable skill

## The Compound Effect of Purposeful Days üìà

Here's where it gets interesting. One day of choosing purpose over pleasure might not feel dramatically different. But string together 30 such days, then 90, then 365, and you'll barely recognize your life.

People who consistently choose meaningful challenge over easy comfort develop:
- Stronger resilience when facing setbacks
- Deeper confidence in their abilities  
- More interesting stories and experiences
- Stronger relationships built on shared goals
- A sense of momentum in life rather than stagnation

## Practical Strategies for Daily Implementation ‚ö°

**The 3-Hour Rule:** Dedicate the first three hours of your day to purposeful activity before allowing any entertainment or passive consumption.

**The Challenge List:** Keep a running list of meaningful but difficult tasks. When you catch yourself defaulting to easy options, pick one from this list instead.

**The Contribution Habit:** End each day by doing something, however small, that benefits someone else. This could be as simple as leaving a thoughtful comment on someone's post or preparing something nice for tomorrow's breakfast.

**The Progress Journal:** Each evening, write down one way you grew or contributed rather than what entertained you. This rewires your brain to notice and value purposeful activities.

## When Purpose Feels Impossible üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Some days, the idea of choosing challenge over comfort feels overwhelming. Maybe you're dealing with stress, illness, or major life changes. During these times, remember that purpose doesn't always mean grand gestures.

On tough days, purpose might mean:
- Maintaining basic self-care routines
- Reaching out to one person who matters to you
- Doing one small thing to improve tomorrow
- Simply showing up when you'd rather hide

The goal isn't perfection; it's direction.

## The Long-Term Vision That Sustains You üîÆ

Imagine looking back on your life decades from now. Which days would you remember with pride? The days you conquered a new level in a video game, or the days you learned something that changed how you think? The afternoons spent mindlessly browsing, or the afternoons spent building something meaningful?

This isn't about judgment‚Äîwe all need rest and entertainment. It's about balance and intentionality. It's about recognizing that the most fulfilling days often begin with the question ""What can I contribute?"" rather than ""What can I consume?""

## The Ripple Effect Beyond Yourself üåä

When you choose purpose over pleasure, you don't just change your own life. You become someone others can rely on. You model possibility for people around you. You contribute to solutions rather than just consuming resources.

Your family notices your energy and engagement. Your friends see your growth and feel inspired to pursue their own goals. Your community benefits from your contributions. This is how individual choices create collective change.

## Building Your Purpose-Driven Tomorrow üåÖ

Starting tomorrow, experiment with this approach:

**Morning:** Before checking any device, identify one meaningful task for the day.

**Afternoon:** When you feel the urge for mindless entertainment, pause and ask ""What would serve me better right now?""

**Evening:** Reflect on moments when you chose growth over comfort, contribution over consumption.

Remember, this isn't about becoming a productivity machine or eliminating all joy from your life. It's about recognizing that true satisfaction comes not from how much pleasure you can extract from a day, but from how much meaning you can create.

The most remarkable thing about choosing purpose over pleasure is this: you don't actually sacrifice happiness. You discover a deeper, more lasting form of it. You trade the fleeting high of instant gratification for the sustained satisfaction of genuine accomplishment.

Every day, you get to choose. Every morning presents the same opportunity. Will today be measured by what entertained you, or by what you contributed to the world?

The answer to that question shapes not just your day, but ultimately, your entire life.

1n2w1nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestNBC/comments/1n2w1nd/happy_828_been_writing_a_sequel_to_this_show_for/,"Happy 8/28! Been Writing a Sequel to This Show For Close to Two Years. Details Inside, Feel Free to Share Your Ideas!","Okay. So I've made dozens, if not *hundreds* of references to this before over the last couple years. And I made a few posts about it before, but I want to share even more details about it as my ideas are becoming much more clear. 

And most importantly, I'm looking for some ideas from this very sub and will give credit where it's due. Because I don't really think I can do this alone. And yes, I do intend to put together a full screenplay of this and present it to whoever may be interested. Possibly Jeff Rake himself, or at least one of his publicists or whatever gatekeepers I'd need to convince.

So without further ado, I give you Pi11ars, a fan created sequel to Manifest.

Okay. No time to waste, let's get right into it. Get some coffee or a beer or something. This will be a long freakin' read.

To me, there are three tensions I came up with after watching the ending of the show. Here they are.

**Tension #1 - Will what transpired during the show take place again? And if it does, when will it take place and who else may be affected?**

If there were to be a sequel, *this* is what it should be all about. Because how do we know that what transpired won't happen again? Or maybe even earlier? Or involve different individuals? Individuals that the passengers who passed the divine's test may need to save? Who knows.

This is what a proper sequel or spin off or whatever should be all about. *Especially* if the passengers have knowledge of the future. Because whether we like it or not, this ending created a Terminator like scenario where even though the passengers are gonna try to change whatever negative things took place during the show, it might cause different things to happen. Things that might be worse.

For example, Grace may be murdered by someone else instead of Angelina. And it may happen *sooner.*

**Tension #2 - How do we know this isn't a time loop? How do we know there isn't gonna be a death date? How do we know it isn't earlier?**

Related to the first tension, this is the next thing that a sequel should be about. Because news flash, just because the passengers ""escaped"" the death date doesn't mean that there isn't another one that might be on the horizon. And in my opinion, there probably is. And that's because...

**Tension #3 - What** ***actually*** **happened to the passengers that turned to ash? And what happened to the timeline the passengers left?**

Okay. I know what most of you are thinking ""well come on j0elsuf, they turned to ash. They don't exist anymore. Duh.""

Well how do you just *know* that? Especially when Daly turned to ash *after* going back to 2013? How come that couldn't happen to the other passengers who turned to ash? You can accuse me of overanalyzing as much as you want, but there *has* to be something to that.

And this isn't something I haven't said on this sub dozens or even hundreds of times, but I'm sorry. The timeline the passengers left didn't just magically *disappear.* That's not how time travel works in storytelling. If you go ahead in time, the timeline you went to will *still exist* whether you like it or not. There have been *hundreds* of shows/movies/video games before Manifest that have established this storytelling precept.

So yeah. That timeline still exists. And guess what? Best believe it's gonna affect the world that the passengers returned to. It *has* to.

Because if it *didn't,* and if a sequel *only* contained Vance (and maybe the major) lookin for the passengers and all the stuff the fandom wants (Michaela hookin up with Zeke, Cal recovering from cancer, Saanvi and Alex establishing their relationship), *no one* would truly like it. Because it would be far too predictable. Those things should happen in a sequel, but other stuff has to happen as well.

So Pi11ars will address those three tensions. But how will it address those tensions? This was where I got waaaaay too creative for my own good. And it's where I'm taking a big risk. And that's because...

**Pi11ars will introduce a brand new cast of characters, the majority of whom are from Angelina's past. And yes, it will contain an arc where Angelina (As well as Daly, Autumn, and Paul) turns over a new leaf.**

When I first started this, that third tension above was the only one I focused on. I came up with a plot where the punished 11 (or 13 or whatever) passengers were sent ahead in time again from June 2nd 2024 to January 2nd 2030. Four of them (Daly, Angelina, Autumn, and Paul) get callings of not only a death date that takes place on March 3rd 2033 in their timeline, but November 11th 2018 in the timeline that the passengers returned to.

You see, the fact that we know next to nothing about Angelina before 828 kinda irked me. We get decent backstory about a lot of the other passengers but next to nothing about Angelina. We don't even know why she went to freakin Jamaica in the first place. But that eventually became my muse for Pi11ars, and allowed me to build whole *worlds* around the very blank canvas that was Angelina's past before 828.

I'll admit, I went a little crazy with this. I gave Angelina a half-sister who is pretty much the exact opposite of her (think of every femme fatale trope you can come up with; that's Angelina's half-sister lol), and this half-sister goes out with a kid sister of Danny's. So yes, Danny is somewhat connected to Angelina. Sarah, the major's daughter, is another half-sister of Angelina's. And that's because it becomes established in Pi11ars that the major is Angelina's real mother.

Then I started thinking: What if I created some characters who grew up with Angelina but who also encountered some of the *other* characters from Manifest at some point before 828? Like what if one had Ben as a professor in college? Or if one delivered food to Grace from that restaurant she liked so much? Or one who encountered Michaela at that skating rink she hung out at all the time? Or if a couple of them were in a band that TJ was auditioning for or something? It's all connected, indeed.

And now that these characters (who went to Jamaica with Angelina but who were on the same flight as Grace and Olive when going back btw) are now looking for Angelina, they'll have to learn about what happened to her in the era that Ben, Michaela et al came from. And it'll be up to certain passengers to guide them. And *that* is because...

**Characters in Pi11ars will still get callings, but only very few will.**

Yup, callings will still be a thing in my sequel. And they'll be almost *totally* based in memory because I liked that aspect of the callings the most.

And different from Manifest, the callings in Pi11ars will be graphic and *very* transparent, as if it's the divine saying ""yo. This *will* happen unless you do something!"" I always thought the callings should have had a horror element to them and in Pi11ars they will. In spades.

So that's what Pi11ars will be about: It'll be about a core group of 828 passengers (Ben, Michaela, Saanvi, TJ, Violet, a few others) helping a core group of passengers on Grace and Olive's flight with their callings. Including Grace and Olive themselves.

Yes, Grace and Olive *will* get callings in Pi11ars. And the ones Olive gets will be so unsettlingly scary that you'll be just as afraid as she gets. You know how Olive had to see therapists and stuff in between those 5 and 1/2 years during Manifest? Well in Pi11ars she will still be seein therapists and stuff, but it'll be because of the callings she's now getting.

And lastly, let's cover the villains of Pi11ars. Starting with...

**The major - Pi11ars will see her at her very worst. But she'll still get killed.**

Anyone who has seen my posts knows that I'm a fanboy for the major. And she is going to be at her very worst in this sequel. She'll do everything she did during Manifest and, because it's revealed that she's Angelina's true mother, she'll be going after those who grew up with her.

It'll be eerily entertaining just like she was during Manifest, too. And like with Angelina, I also built worlds around the major. Given all the military experience she has, I have plenty to work with.

But have no fear. The major will be stopped. But by who? She'll be stopped by a villain I'm creating who you'll have no choice but to dislike. Imagine a cross between Aileen Wuornos, Terry Silver from Karate Kid/Cobra Kai, and Bryce from 13 Reasons Why. That's who's gonna stop the major.

But I don't wanna spoil this too much. And admittedly, this is slowly becoming something of my own creation, with the Manifest-iverse or whatever as a backdrop. But! I'm still open to ideas. Let me know if you enjoyed this. I almost want to create my own sub for this, but idk. I do have a discord channel for it where I upload scripts and stuff. Hit me up if you're down for joining that.

1n2vxae,https://i.redd.it/5mn2akxlgvlf1.jpeg,Scott Dunbier shares a personalized Kirby sketch and story!,"Dunbier on Facebook: In 1978 I found out that Jack Kirby had a listed phone number. My mom and I had just move to woodland Hills in the San Fernando Valley, outside of Los Angeles. I picked up the phone and dialed 411 (this used to be a handy way to get phone numbers, for all you kids) and sure enough, they gave me his number. Without much thought I called the number. A gravelly voice answered the phone and said hello. I said, ""Hi, can I speak with Jack Kirby?"" That was the start of an amazing adventure. We spoke for 20 minutes and at the end of the call he asked where I lived. I told him and he said, ""That's not too far from me. Why don't you get your mom to drive you over here this weekend and I can sign all your comics?"" My Mom, bless her, said yes and we drove to Thousand Oaks that weekend. As promised, he signed all my comics and we talked for an hour while my mom and Roz Kirby drank lots of coffee and smoked cigarettes (at least mom did!). Later we sat in their kitchen and ate sandwiches. Before we left, Jack Kirby gave me a portfolio and then sat down and drew this for me. One of the greatest experiences of my life, an unbelievable act of kindness and generosity. Happy Birthday to the King. Comics fans owe you so much more than they realize.

Tried a bunch of different things like an ecommerce coffee brand, smma, and did monetize a YouTube channel but it already fizzled out. Now I‚Äôm learning to code an app.

The biggest takeaway for me is that it‚Äôs not just about starting something up, but it‚Äôs the battle you have internally with yourself that‚Äôs the first dragon to slay. And that dragon is indecision. 

Constantly fearful of what to do, how to do it, and constantly searching for the elusive answers. Often I‚Äôd ask around on reddit, in Facebook groups ‚Äúwhat do you think of this? Should I do this or that? How much should I charge‚Äù etc etc.

You feel lost in a dark forest with no compass and you‚Äôre trying not to make a single misstep. And you search for somebody to tell you what to do. A precarious position to always be in. 

Anyway, I finally read a book that is so damn good. It is like a practical manual on starting up with so many gems. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúBurn The Boats‚Äù by Matt Higgins. He‚Äôs a VC and was a guest shark on Shark Tank.

The book drove the point home about intuition. Going with your gut. 

And at least to me, that was a light bulb because up to that point, for some unknown reason I had never considered that. Like that internal opinion wasn‚Äôt good enough to trust. Like I needed an outside perspective to be sure. 

It‚Äôs so absurd to think about in hindsight especially since anytime I‚Äôve gone against my gut in anything, I‚Äôve always lived to regret it. 

Even with the YouTube channel which is the only money I‚Äôve ever made online(a couple of hundos), I had the gut feeling like it would work way more than the other things I tried.

Now whenever that nagging feeling of uncertainty creeps in, I just default to ‚Äúim going with my gut on this.‚Äù

In further researching into this, turns out the secret that many super successful titans of industry swear by is going with their gut.

I also may have cut myself off and most likely didn‚Äôt finish things I was saying I have bad anxiety and do that a lot I apologize in advance.

I mainly came here to see if anyone has left a property they were renting - apartment/house either one , particularly people who had trouble with their landlords / property management , did they give you a hard time ? . I‚Äôve lived at my complex for about 2 years now . I‚Äôve had nothing but trouble with the property management , maintenance & the issues in the unit from the night I moved in literally the night I moved in there was a leak from my air vent .. I live in a basement level unit so I ( and the others on the basement level of course ) get the worst of the leaks etc , upon move in I did an inspection ( alone which is uncommon for me ) I noticed many things were wrong . Even though they claimed the unit was professionally cleaned the carpet was covered in cat hair ( I‚Äôm not exaggerating) now I‚Äôm HIGHLY allergic like my eyes swell shut I sneeze bad & I have asthma so it feels like death when I make a wrong move around cats , I wrote that in my report as well as documented there wasn‚Äôt a microwave how it claimed in the inspection list , the bathtub was stripped (they must‚Äôve been painting over damage ) my bedroom door was off the top hinge .. dished from previous tenants were still in the dishwasher. The cabinets are white and you could tell they weren‚Äôt cleaned . What looked like coffee was still on the side of the wall .. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but those are what I remember, there have been about 6 water leaks 2 being severe with 1 busting out of my cabinets .. the old maintenance man ( who was the father of a guy who‚Äôs stalked me for about 7-8 years ) was polite enough to let us wash and dry our towels we used to clean up with for free .. not even a week later we have another bad leak .. well the usual guy came in said he was now part time ( haven‚Äôt seen him since ) and he left another guy came by lets call him ice tea because that‚Äôs who he resembles , he came by and the old maintenance men would come by laugh about it and take 20-30 mins to even come back well he assessed the situation and handled it , turned off the water and said he‚Äôd speak with the manager figure out what to do next . Didn‚Äôt get the free wash of the laundry we had to use ( still washed it with our own coins not to mention the washer and dryers absolutely suck but we are having transportation issues so only option last minute ) I‚Äôm going to skip a day ahead the maintenance man randomly knocked on the door ( now ik it their job to care for units , buildings etc ) but normally we are warned if someone‚Äôs coming by and he gave no warning , he wanted to come in and check our carpet ( there was a small spot that in my opinion didn‚Äôt need checking it had a drying unit in front of it and we usually put them back in the hall when we are done using it ) well he knocked let him check on it he left , I let the office know id like to be warned dude to not only him but the carpet company coming in as well , how I grew up you‚Äôre always supposed to make your home and self look presentable before allowing someone in .. let me say this day my house was not all that tidy I have children & if you have kids you know once you clean up they go right back over it , well I text the office he responds and agrees to let me know next time , I‚Äôd say a week goes by , the toilet in the room my kids use is leaking and I see the base of the floor collecting mold ( I‚Äôm like 100% sure it‚Äôs mold , there‚Äôs mold in so many spots here and I can‚Äôt do anything but spray it with this spray I have and move alone hoping it doesn‚Äôt come back. I‚Äôve reported it before but they don‚Äôt do much but paint over it and like me they hope it doesn‚Äôt come back & it does it got to the point the ignore most of my requests come by look at it and say it‚Äôs something else ) okay so the new guy and landlord ( male ) comes in they look say toilet needs a new band & base boards aren‚Äôt molding they didn‚Äôt even say it was mildew .. mind you we had a mild leak in that bathroom through the exhaust fan that in-fact created mold in my main bathroom (that‚Äôs what they painted over and left which it‚Äôs back visible) now back when that leak happened they sent someone to fix the walls he never touched my bathroom took a piece of wall from second bathroom left I asked about my bathroom they came in I heard the 2 guys whispering about what to do , one said something about how they needed to tear that wall down the other goes ‚Äúshhh‚Äù they finished talking left & guy comes back & that‚Äôs when they painted and left  it to marinate, now back to ice tea and landlord they‚Äôre here talking basically contradicting themselves bc they knew what I said was right . And I‚Äôve came to the conclusion these people don‚Äôt want to fix anything bc it will have to come out of their pocket .. they have upped the rent twice and still don‚Äôt have enough to make repairs? Okay so I‚Äôll skip a lot to get to my point , they basically called the same guy that did the first bathroom repair and I kid you not he painted over what was on the boards .. I complained and they acted surprised.. they come back remove them be on their way .. now I have a terrible memory but do have all of what I‚Äôve experienced documented just not looking at it I‚Äôm sure things happened after this and before but this is just what I‚Äôm remembering on spot . So what is bringing me here today . I made a complaint for the second time about my mail box . In the past I‚Äôve caught it wide open and was able to close it without needing to unlock it ( the lock was turned by the postal worker even tho it wasn‚Äôt closed ) well I complained they came by said nothing was wrong okay I left it alone , recently they have been complaining about mail on the floor so when I caught my box open yesterday I tried to make another complaint hoping with new workers they‚Äôd actually help , do the request apparently they still saw nothing wrong . Now when you make the complaint there‚Äôs an option that says like for quick response or what ever do we have approval for entry and there‚Äôs like no , yes or n/a entry not needed so I clicked that ‚Ä¶ Ice tea still came by ? My child‚Äôs father answers ( I‚Äôve been having kidney and heart troubles so yes he‚Äôs been a angel and helping me out more than usual) I‚Äôm not sure why that upset the guy & I know I did leave a lot of my experiences with him out due to memory or me thinking I could be just assuming but let me add I don‚Äôt wear a bra all the time ‚Ä¶ but the first time Ice tea and the landlord came by child‚Äôs father wasn‚Äôt there and I had no bra on and kept my arms crossed the entire time let me add even when you put maintenance requests in they never come on the day or time you placed it for so again caught way off guard, aside from being vulnerable I can‚Äôt think of any other reason why a man answering my door would‚Äôve upset him , he marked it as complete came to the door told child‚Äôs father nothing was wrong , I texted the office voicing how this is the second time nothing was corrected about the box ( I get it it‚Äôs a mail box but with all of the other things they don‚Äôt want to fix yes I get frustrated with every little thing they try to over look ) well this lady replied for me to call ice tea .. I said that is who said nothing was wrong with it ‚Ä¶ basically this guy went back to the office and I‚Äôm not sure what words he used but told the lady ( she‚Äôs not based In My city so he had to of called her ) and told her a guy answered my door I‚Äôm assuming so she texts back saying when can I meet with him at the box .. and then says oh he said a guy answered ( I‚Äôll add the messages now again I‚Äôm always on high alert with these people they try to do and say anything to make you look bad or like you‚Äôre doing something wrong so yes I may look as if I‚Äôm beating around the bush or being rude but like what did my children or the father have to do with the mail box ? Well after my last text she still tried to mention the mail box & no I did not reply i felt like she was trying to argue ( usually how every text from management always feels ) so I tend to not respond today was one of those days I responded but tried to keep it together.. now sorry for the sob story my over all question was would I be over acting to abandon my lease ? Do you think they would try to take me to court ( which would backfire on their behalf due to me having a truck load of evidence of negligence and health hazards ) my lease isn‚Äôt up for a couple of months so I‚Äôd be in debt if I moved but I‚Äôm starting to think it would be in everyone‚Äôs best interest . ( I would still pay the rent on time if they give me the option to ) let me know if I was wrong and if I should just not reply in the future which if it‚Äôs nothing big I‚Äôll probably just not put a maintenance request in and let them take it out of my deposit.

EO is an incredibly demanding sect of Christianity that appears to offer enlightenment, mystery, and mysticism. Originally, I found their perspective on God's essence and energies/Theosis unique and exciting. Now, I see that it's really just a Buddha-zation of Christianity (the desire for unlocking Theosis is truly quite selfish) and that underneath their zen exterior is an animus towards scholasticism and critical thinking. When questioned on a theological point, they fall back on their laurels and say, ""But do *they* have a St. Paisos?""

I believe that the cult-like aspect (besides the glaring example of Mount Athos and all of monkdom) is that they expect so much from the parishioners in regards to money and time--and does that money and time go to worthy causes or helping the needy? No. It's directly funneled back into the church and for the continued existence of the church. It's truly a shame that they aren't a greater presence for good in America. Between the constant church services, volunteering, pressure to attend social events and coffee hours--I found myself so spent that I didn't even have the bandwidth or desire to read my Bible. 

Lastly, I have seen derision towards the elderly and poor, legalistic paranoia about fasting, hatred towards the Jews, and objectification of women.

For starters I'm 19 yrs old and started the job initially 8 hour days 5 days a week and my mom is also working there with me it's at a small (but popular) family owned coffee roasting business which is abt a 35 min drive away from where I currently live and since I started at 8am to 4pm I had to wake up at 7am which I'm not used to at all so I got my hours bumped down to 6 hours a day and am now starting at 10am - 4pm same with my mom but for different reasons.

For some of the benefits I have great coworkers, a great boss who is very understanding and lenient, 30 min paid lunch, generally easy work.

downsides is that it's an extremely loud place since it's a factory, pay isn't the best but not the worst, and the 35 min drive there and back every day.

I just don't know why I'm so freaked out about it I've been spending the last few days the night before work bawling my eyes out due to just pure worry about whats to come and I shouldn't be worried since I like the job and the people I'm just thinking I might have some major anticipatory anxiety or it's just such a drastic change to my life that I'm having trouble handling it and it's making me worry about EVERY little thing in my life even my parents dying in the future and how I'll handle myself without them and more recently some crazy life or death shit just happened to my cousin and it's been making me feel that more the past couple days.

It just feels like I'm throwing away some freedoms and that thought alone is overwhelming even at my last job where I was working 4 hour days starting at like 11am some days and 6pm other days I would still go to sleep at night dreading the next work day I just need major advice or some way to relax my mind.",2,1756434929.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

I believe trade skills (electricians, mechanics, etc.) will be one of the few blue collar job markets that will survive the coming AI and tech revolution. However, back to low-skill jobs, I fully believe jobs like assembly line workers, fast food workers, cashiers, hostesses and waiters, taxi and uber drivers, and many more will become obsolete as robotics transition into becoming a cheaper labor option. Yes, I know a majority of robotics companies are in the very early trial phase, and many of the existing prototypes have not become fully functional. While that may be a bearish sign for the robotics market now, I believe it only provides RR with less barriers to entry in the coming years. As I said before, Richtech is financially backed by NVIDIA and operates on their platforms. This allows RR to put more focus into the development of their robotics as they have a 4.4 trillion dollar market giant lining their pockets.

Enough about NVIDIA, let‚Äôs continue to discuss RR‚Äôs market opportunity in the future. As consumer and commercial robotics transition into the global labor market, companies like Richtech have the opportunity to become the face of an entirely new industry. I really love this stock, and believe robotics poses a similar market opportunity to Apple in 2008. As we have seen with every form of new technology that comes out, initial reactions are typically all over the place, often siding towards skepticism.

Historical Examples
Steve Ballmer (former CEO of Microsoft) said this, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.‚Äù Yeah okay bud, how did that turn out for you.

Or similarly, look at the public reaction to the current AI revolution. This is not to say that there is always a bad reaction as new technology is released, just that the public often sides towards skepticism vs optimism. Robotics is currently the center of one of these optimism vs. skepticism debates in regards to its long term potential. This is why I believe now is the best buying opportunity for robotics and robotics stocks. This is a situation where we have the chance to buy that metaphorical iPhone at its release (i.e robotics). Don‚Äôt be a Steve Balmer, look beyond the next few years!

Technology and Software
Richtech Robotics currently has seven operational robot models with a variety of functions.

Competitors/Current Market Landscape

Richtech Robotics is taking aim at the low skill job industry I spoke about earlier with their service industry robotics. Industry analysts point to a market with few pure-play automation names to lean on. Serve Robotics is one comparable, though it focuses more on autonomous delivery, while titans like ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell Automation dominate factory-floor automation Meanwhile, established robotics firms such as Intuitive Surgical shine in medical automation. At its core, Richtech‚Äôs competitive edge lies in its niche deployment in hospitality, health, and cleaning. I believe that these three industries could be some of the most affected by the upcoming robotic revolution. The company has already deployed over 300 robots across the U.S., blending proof-points with scale. RR is positioned to become the Apple, Google, Tesla of the robotics industry by 2030.

Future Potential

I fully believe to my core that Richtech stands on the brink of something big, even though the path might be a longer journey. The global retail automation market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, highlighting the magnitude of opportunity ahead. They recently signed two-year Master Services Agreement (with auto-renewal) with a major retailer signals a breakthrough in actual channel penetration and investor sentiment. For example, the stock soared 23% on that news alone. Add to that the Walmart ghost-kitchen deployments running Richtech robots in dozens of locations and the revenue potential becomes very tangible. These locations are each projected to pull in between $700,000 and $2 million annually. Pair this with Richtech‚Äôs 76% gross margin and strong solvency score (81/100), and you‚Äôve got a company that isn‚Äôt just spending its cash left and right, it has a robust financial base to reinvest aggressively.

On the flip side, risks are real: analysts widely forecast price targets in the $2.50‚Äì$3.50 range, with an average near current levels. This implies modest to minimal short term upside. Freedom Broker recently downgraded RR to Sell, citing overvaluation and the need for more deliverables from its retailer partners before they‚Äôll reconsider. 

This poses a good buying opportunity for us. Many may still be thinking like Steve Balmer regarding the iPhone. Public perception still thinks robotics may be a fad or may never be able to ‚Äúcapture the market share.‚Äù All that aside, robotics has been framed as ""the next era"" by Nvidia‚Äôs CEO himself. So, Richtech is very much in the spotlight. Not only that, but its use of Nvidia‚Äôs scalable AI platform is an edge no current robotics competitor can replicate.

TL;DR

If you just want to read a paragraph, here you go:


Richtech Robotics (RR), trading at ~$3 today, backed by Nvidia, has seven operating service industry robots. Robotics has infinite market opportunities in retail, hospitality, and healthcare. I believe this is undeniably reminiscent of early-stage Apple circa 2008. Current verdict: strong margin profile, robust cash and solvency, tangible large-scale deployments en route. I believe that proof of consistent revenue execution is the crucial next step towards a robotics revolution. If you‚Äôre in for being a long-term investor, I have unwavering faith that RR could be the next Apple-like stock within the next 10-15 years.

I wanted to let you guys know, even though I hadn‚Äôt announced it on here yet that I was planning to do a range day tomorrow, I have a lot of different things in life going on right now that is not making that feasible. I was going to announce this earlier in the week, but like I said, there‚Äôs a lot of serious stuff going on right now in my life (that is very bad, quite frankly) that it just wasn‚Äôt on my mind or a priority. I will go more into detail in the meeting for transparency reasons as transparency is one of my biggest values but in short, due to a mental health/red flag situation in Michigan, My gun rights are suspended for the next year as Michigan thinks I ‚Äúam a high enough suicide risk‚Äù that I need a temporary separation from them, and I‚Äôm not working armed security anymore for that reason as I had to turn in my duty gun. I did feel the need to at least address this a little bit in case you guys see or hear anything online. That is one of many things that it‚Äôs going on in my life right now that it made me cancel the range day. 

I can still be around guns, technically, but I cannot be in possession of them or use them; again, this was because a mental health/red flag order, which expires in a year. I just didn‚Äôt want you guys getting the wrong type of picture here thinking that I‚Äôm out here doing bad shit lol.


What I will say, however is that our normal meeting schedule is still going to be the same. Our next meeting is going to be next Friday at 7:30PM like the usual meeting times at The Well Coffee House in South Bend. 

I hope to see the more newer faces there, some of the old ones, and hopefully some brand new ones. I absolutely love you guys and I love what we‚Äôve created here, I don‚Äôt know each individual member super super well, but from what I have seen from you guys, you have shown me that you are very good people with good hearts and I appreciate your guys‚Äô presence and engagement and what we have created here.

So I've started reading romcoms recently and while it isn't much, one trope I've noticed is that instead of the modern ""online dating"" where you select potential partners by their provided parameters on the dating website, chat online and go on real-life dates in hopes that you will click with each other; or the current ""offline dating"" where you also purposefully select a potential partner at an event or activity (such as at a party, at a bar or even at a hobby convention) and court him or her in hopes that both of you will click; relationships in romcoms are often depicted as of follows:

Originally the main characters have a platonic relationship each other: they can be classmates, coworkers, or hell, even patrons at the same bookstore or the same coffee shop (TBH I also don't know why romcoms love the bookstore or coffee shop setting so much lol). But as time goes on, through the many events that both of them partake in, they gradually start to develop romantic feelings for each other.

Their relationship often gets tested and they have their ups and downs throughout the narration, yet the many challenges they face throughout the narration only serves as kindling for the mutual feeling they have for each other, until the end where during a romantic setting (such as on a scenic spot on a hill under a round moon overlooking the city or beside the shimmering river under a round room during a festival, note how there is also always a round moon thrown in there), they confess their mutual feelings for each other and go for an often awkward but passionate kiss.

1n2vm8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateExam/comments/1n2vm8m/if_youre_struggling_with_the_ny_real_estate_exam/,"If You‚Äôre Struggling With the NY Real Estate Exam, Read This (I Just Passed!)","This journey started back in January when I got laid off. I was struggling hard‚Äîsubmitting job applications, barely getting interviews, collecting rejection emails left and right. I didn‚Äôt have a professional network and honestly had no clue how I‚Äôd find work again.

Since I was on unemployment, the state sent me invites to job fairs. I decided to attend one at a local university gymnasium. Being an extrovert, I went table to table, asking about opportunities. That‚Äôs when I found myself at the Keller Williams table. I spoke with two reps about what it‚Äôs like to be a real estate agent. When they mentioned they‚Äôd cover the cost of my real estate course, that was the spark.

They sent me an email with a discount code (100% off) for the **77-hour Kaplan Real Estate Course**. At first, it was brutal. Growing up, I hated school. Reading never came naturally to me, and Kaplan‚Äôs format‚Äîparagraphs on paragraphs on a screen‚Äîwas overwhelming.

***But here‚Äôs how I got through it:***

* Kaplan has 26 units. I read each sentence slowly until I understood it.
* I wrote notes in my own words (not just copying the screen).
* I created a blank Google Doc and typed out every end-of-unit quiz Q&A.
* Then, I‚Äôd paste them into ChatGPT and have the AI quiz me until I could get them all right. 

Each unit took me 5‚Äì6 hours. I camped out at Starbucks so often that people gossiped about how long I stayed. The baristas got to know me, cheered me on, and even slipped me free coffee sometimes. That little community kept me going.

By late July, I finished all 26 units with 116 logged hours (77 required). Then came the **Kaplan proctored final exam.**

The first time, I failed with a 55%. I felt crushed. But I refused to quit.

Digging deeper, I realized I had been practicing with the wrong test. **Kaplan‚Äôs ‚ÄúPretest v1.0‚Äù barely matched the actual exam. What I needed was the ‚ÄúPost Test v10.‚Äù** Once I switched, I drilled it over and over‚Äî100 questions at a time‚Äîuntil I could ace it **ten times in a row.**

On my second try, I went in with only two words in my head: **Revenge and Passing**. I flew through it in under 10 minutes (the first attempt took me 25). This time, **I scored a 97%.**

With the certificate in hand, I **scheduled my NY State Exam for two weeks later in Pomona, NY.**

**The exam: 75 questions, only 2 math.** At first, I was breezing through‚ÄîI‚Äôd read half the question and already know the answer. But by the 40s, things got tricky. **The wording was intentionally confusing.**

Some people finished quickly and handed in their tests. I stayed focused on my own pace. **My strategy: if I wasn‚Äôt sure, I marked it on the scrap paper and moved on. After finishing the whole exam, I circled back to those flagged questions.**

**Out of \~20 people in the room, I was one of the last 5 still working.** And that was fine‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to rush just to match others.

The waiting period was torture‚Äîthree days of checking the state site, biting my nails, full of anxiety. And then finally: I saw PASS.

***What Helped Me Most:***

* Take your time with the 26 units. Don‚Äôt rush‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding, not speed.
* Write notes in your own words. That forces real comprehension.
* Use practice tests strategically. Make sure you‚Äôre using the right ones.
* Breaks are necessary. Burnout kills progress.
* Ignore how fast or slow others test. Focus on your own paper.

***Final Thoughts***

You‚Äôre stronger than you think and smarter than you realize. If you fail, it doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt be a great agent. Some of the most determined people I‚Äôve met are the ones who failed first‚Äîbut came back stronger.

That ‚Äúrevenge mindset‚Äù I had after failing pushed me to dig deeper and prove myself. **So if you‚Äôre on this path: persist. The only way you lose is if you give up.**

On the day Sophie found out she was pregnant, she heard the cruelest sentences from her fianc√©‚Äî ""The baby might be a Morgan,"" Liam Morgan sneered, pulling another woman into his arms, ""but it sure as hell isn't mine.""  ""A fool like you? You're nothing but a pawn to secure my inheritance."" Devastated, Sophie ran, only to be pinned against the wall by Marcus Morgan, Liam's uncle, who also was the ruthless head of the Morgan family. ""You're carrying my child, and you think you can just walk away?"" With that, Marcus tore up her old engagement contract, crushed his conniving nephew, then turned to Sophie and whispered darkly, ""From now on, you're the one and forever Mrs. Morgan."" However, with one hand on her baby bump, Sophie just smirked. ""Mr. Morgan, are you sure the baby is yours?""  He grabbed her jaw, breath hot and dangerous. ""Then let's have another little one.""

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Chapter 1

 ""Place your bets, Sophie's having a boy, no doubt about it.""

 Her hand froze midair on the door handle.

 It was clearly her boyfriend's voice.

 She'd come here to tell him the good news, of course. But how has Liam already knew she was pregnant?

 Then a roar of laughter exploded inside the private room.

 ""Liam, man, you really hit the jackpot this time! The Chandler princess is so into you, she's even carrying your baby! That means all the Chandler family's resources are basically yours, right?""

 Sophie peered through the narrow crack in the door.

 Liam sat with one leg crossed over the other, swirling a glass of wine, that smug face, one she'd loved for three years, looking impossibly pleased with himself.

 ""Please. The kid's not even mine.""

 A slow, mocking smile crept across his lips. ""I never touched her.""

 Sophie's mind went blank. Her whole body turned cold.

 ""What?! Then who's the father?!"" Jake's voice cracked with shock.

 ""How would I know?"" Liam spun his Macallan lazily, voice light as air. ""She probably just found some random guy at the Hamptons. She's dumb enough to believe whatever you tell her. As long as she thinks it's mine, it's all good. Even if Mr. Chandler hates my guts, now he has no choice but to hand her over.""

 ""Once we're married, my place in the Morgan family is set.""

 She clenched the doorknob so hard her knuckles turned bone white.

 ""Damn, Liam, that's one hell of a hustle,"" said the Goldman Sachs guy, smirking. ""Aren't you worried she'll figure it out someday?""

 ""Worried?"" Liam let out a laugh. ""She's a total pushover. I could tell her our Met Gala meeting was fate and she'd believe it. And even if she does catch on, so what? We'll be married by then. What can she even do?""

 Another wave of laughter followed, glasses clinking in celebration like they'd already won some big game.

 Outside the door, Sophie felt the whole world tilt.

 She'd only gotten the positive test from her Upper East Side gynecologist a week ago. Her plan had been to surprise him on his birthday with the news.

 She'd imagined the moment a hundred times, how thrilled he'd be, how he'd pull her into his arms with tears in his eyes, promising her forever.

 But what she got instead was an even bigger surprise.

 The baby wasn't his.

 Then whose child was she carrying?

 Chapter 2

 ""That dumb bitch Sophie? All money, no brains. I've had enough of her.""

 Sophie stopped breathing.

 ""Once I drain the Chandler family's cash after we're married, the first thing I'll do is kick her to the curb.""

 The words hit her like ice water. Three years, and this was what he really thought of her.

 Laughter erupted from the room. ""Damn, Liam, you're cold! But smart. Why work when you can marry into money?""

 ""She makes it so easy,"" Liam's voice carried through the door, dripping with contempt. ""Desperate little princess, fighting mommy and daddy for me. I just have to smile and she hands over everything.""

 Sophie's knees nearly gave out. The hallway felt suffocating, the expensive cologne and smoke choking her.

 She couldn't listen anymore.

 Sophie walked to her car in a daze. Three years of fighting her parents for him. Three years of believing he loved her. She'd starved herself when they disapproved. Cried herself to sleep. Nearly destroyed her relationship with her family.

 All for a man who called her a desperate little princess.

 All lies.

 She sat in the driver's seat, hand on her stomach. The baby wasn't even his. Then whose was it? That night two months ago was still a blur of alcohol and fragmented memories.

 Her phone buzzed.

 A text from Liam.

 [Hey babe, where are you? Thought you were coming over?]

 She stared at the screen, her heart going colder by the second. Even now, he was performing. The caring boyfriend act, when minutes ago he'd been calling her a desperate little princess.

 The drive home passed in a blur. By the time she pulled into the driveway, darkness had fallen over the villa.

 The house felt empty, silent. Sophie curled up on the couch, replaying every moment of their relationship. Had there ever been anything real? Any genuine feeling from his side?

 Her parents had been right all along. Liam was from a side branch of the Morgans‚Äîambitious but powerless. And she'd been his ticket to the top.

 Footsteps approached the front door.

 Liam walked in, wearing his signature gentle smile.

 ""There you are, sweetheart. Where did you disappear to?"" He placed a takeout bag on the coffee table. ""Got your favorite from that place you love. Parking was a nightmare.""

 What an act.

 She stared at him, numb.

 ""Hey, you alright? You look rough."" He reached for her forehead, worry creasing his brow. ""Are you running a fever? You shouldn't be driving around if you're not feeling well.""

 She turned her head away. ""I'm fine.""

 ""You sure? You seem off."" His concern sounded so genuine. How had she never seen through this act? ""Maybe you should rest. I can stay the night, take care of you.""

 ""You said you had a surprise for me. What is it?"" Liam's eyes lit up with anticipation, leaning forward slightly.

 Sophie met his gaze.

 She could see the calculation in his eyes. He was waiting for pregnancy news that would seal his future.

 ""My family just landed a major business deal. Big numbers.""

 The light in his eyes died instantly. His smile faltered for just a moment before snapping back into place. ""That's... that's great news, baby.""

 She watched him try to hide his disappointment. He'd been expecting something else. Something about the baby he somehow already knew about.

 ""Isn't that worth celebrating?"" she said quietly.

 ""Of course! Hell yeah!"" He scrambled to recover, gesturing at the takeout. ""This calls for champagne. Well, maybe sparkling cider for you since you..."" He caught himself. ""Since you look a bit under the weather.""

 Nice save. But she'd caught it.

 ""I just thought maybe you were going to say your family had finally agreed to the wedding.""

 Sophie watched him fake his way through it. Three years of falling for his bullshit. Three years of being his ""desperate little princess.""

 But that Sophie was gone.

 She smiled‚Äîa real smile this time, though not for the reasons he'd think.

 ""Don't worry,"" she said softly. ""I have plenty more surprises coming.""

 Chapter 3

 Late at night, alone in bed, Sophie couldn't close her eyes without seeing that hazy figure again.

 The baby wasn't Liam's.

 Then who was that man that night?

 She had to find out, fast.

 The next morning, she headed straight for the hotel.

 ""I'm so sorry, Ms. Chandler,"" the hotel manager said, full of regret. ""There was a system failure that day. All the surveillance footage was lost.""

 ""Really? Of all days, it had to be that one?""

 The manager's eyes darted away, his voice lacking confidence. ""It was truly an accident. We're deeply sorry‚Ä¶""

 Sophie let out a cold laugh and turned to leave.

 The hotel belonged to the Morgans. If Liam wanted something erased, all he had to do was lift a finger.

 Still, no matter what, she was going to find out who the father was.

 She clenched her fists, eyes filled with a stubborn, burning resolve.

 3 p.m., at the convention center.

 She sat beside her father, her thoughts stuck on the hotel footage. She couldn't focus on the auction at all.

 ""Sophie, that's Marcus Morgan.""

 Her father leaned in to whisper in her ear.

 She blinked, snapping back to the moment. Her gaze drifted toward the entrance, where a man was walking in, surrounded by a crowd.

 Sharp, chiseled features. An air of power and distance clung to him with every move he made.

 Marcus.

 Liam's uncle.

 The real head of the Morgan family.

 The man holding the lifeline of Riverland's entire economy.

 She'd heard rumors, Marcus was ruthless and decisive. Every time Liam caught wind of him nearby, he'd grab her hand and take a detour.

 ""If we can strike a deal with the Morgans,"" her father murmured with awe, ""our family will be untouchable in Riverland.""

Both of us fell in love with him instantly. We were both home all day, every day until recently. I went back to work in July and my daughter went off to college last week. I am gone 11-12 hours a day and Theo has been able to get out of his cage and jump a gate. He‚Äôs been peeing on our coffee table, pooping everywhere. We love him so much but we are not able to give him the attention we did before. As much as I don‚Äôt want to, I started looking into rehoming. By complete accident, a friend of mine mentioned on a FB post she had a friend who was looking for a puppy. I reached out to her and her friend lost his yorkie a few months ago. After some chit chat and some pics, the friend wants to adopt Theo. He said we can visit wherever, meet at the dog park and even get him for some sleepovers. We are supposed to meet over the weekend to give him our baby. I am so sad. I know it‚Äôs got the best but I can‚Äôt quit thinking about hiw much I‚Äôm going to miss him. Am I doing the right thing?

1n2vh37,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n2vh37/should_i_reach_out_to_my_ex/,Should I reach out to my ex?,"this will be a long post. but should I reach out to my ex? some back story:



we have a complicated story. she came back into my life this year because she missed me and wanted to reconcile. she was much more grown from when we previously dated (i did lots of therapy work too), so reconciliation seemed like a good idea. plus, i never really stopped loving her. 



but the thing is, she left my life during a really, really vulnerable time. this was early last year. im 28. my parents got in a car crash, my mom didn't make it, dad spent months in a hospital, I cancelled my cross country move to stay home and take care of things. it was maybe the most intense grief/panic/shock/trauma I've ever felt. i remember constant panic attacks and breakdowns and it was just an AWFUL time. 



my ex and i had problems. we argued a lot, and i was a slightly reactive person back then. i wasn't rude, i was just very direct and blunt in how i spoke (she was a very soft spoken person and she needed that from me, which i understand). we argued a lot and eventually she left me about 3 months after the accident. it was really hard on me to have both of those losses back to back, and i spent a majority of last year and this year basically hating myself for ruining us. I remember spending WEEKS trying to get her to come back, i cried endlessly to her, left her long voicemails, left so many texts like apologizing nonstop. I thought i was some monster and i thought i deserved these losses and i was trying to just save things i guess. 



well some times passed and i was able to reflect on the relationship. and yes, we argued, and yes, i was reactive. but i was looking at certain situations after my mom passed away. 



\-one time, we had a string of days where she cried to me daily. this was maybe 2-3 weeks after the accident. I remember telling her ""would you be able to keep things together? most of my day is spent comforting my crying sisters and my (barely alive) father, it's hard to hear more crying"". after a few days of this, she told me ""am i just not worth the effort to you?"" and i remember i snapped that day. and i absolutely acknowledge that my reaction could have been better, but I remember how me and my life situation felt so small at that time. and her crying was only because she missed me (obviously if something major happened, i would absolutely comfort her, but if it wasn't major, i needed to give my energy to my family). 



\-i wont list more examples but there were many more instances where she said and did inconsiderate things to me, but it was hidden behind a soft tone, but after a while, i would react. and my ""reaction"" is just a very blunt/direct version of me, i never like degraded her or anything. i remember she wanted to come see me one time, and i told her if we could please wait, because my life is so unstable and i kindof want to face everything head on and build my routine again. new job, frequent trips to the hospital to see dad, taking care of the house - my life was just so hectic and i wanted to build a version of myself that could satisfy all these needs. and so i told my ex that we should wait a little if that's okay (we were long distance). her coming would only add to my plate at that time, things were just not okay at all in the family. and she told me eventually ""i figured you must not love me if i couldn't come see you"" (we had seen eachother 2 times in 2 months already, this is way more than what we normally do. infact we were texting more, calling more, seeing eachother more, i was pouring SO MUCH love onto her daily...it just shocked me that she said that). other examples like this....



so yeah, i was reactive sometimes. i was firm, that's all. but after reflecting, i was like 'wait, yes i could have been better but she was SO inconsiderate randomly. i didn't ruin everything. i needed peace and understanding in that time. it doesn't mean im perfect but im at fault maybe 20% of the time and she was the other 80%. i didn't deserve this breakup, i didn't deserve to grieve 2 losses at once, i dont deserve any of this hardship.



but by this point, it was a year of no contact. a year of me collapsing, on medication, panic attacks, crying myself to sleep so many nights, fighting trauma from the accident, and my ex wasn't there. but i can never hate her. im not perfect, maybe she didn't know any better. 



so this year around may she came back into my life. she wanted to try again. and i was hesitant but i agreed. to me, i worked on my problems, and she apologized and owned up to her lack of maturity and understanding from the past. she seemed sweeter, kinder, and im literally in contact with the person i wanted to marry. i couldn't say no. 



but internally i felt i was at war. on one hand, i love this girl SO much. her smile, laugh, dumb stories - i smile even just thinking about her. but on the other hand, i remember how i went most of 2024 without her. i remember those 3am nights where im crying so hard and i want to call her for some love and i can't. i remember going through my bday, and every holiday, and things are just so unbearably sad here without mom, and all i wanted was my ex, and she wasn't there. i cried so so so much last year. daily basically. and so, that pain just hits me like a truck when she enters my life again. we both say our sorries, we both try to softly enter eachother's life again, but my pain never could go away. i guess on the inside i wanted to SCREAM at her for leaving. our love was too pure for this. our love was too pure for me to be grieving my mom while she was in another relationship. i felt so small and replaceable and discarded and i just felt like this whole thing was extremely unfair to me. we HAD this shit, we were THE couple, we could have achieved so much together, but we didn't...... 



and that pain just stays with me constantly. and 99.9% of the time, it showed only as sadness. I tried to hide it but ever since she came back into my life, i cried daily again. just constant breakdowns from this beautiful relationship - to a confusing breakup - to now almost being strangers again. to me, it was avoidable, every last bit of it. but i still love her so freaking much. i still want her to be my forever. im hurt but i cant stop loving her. and the battle between the love and the pain made me feel so off. i remember so many days where i would just breakdown to her for no reason. or she facetimes me and my eyes are red (from a breakdown earlier). i felt like i was carrying a thousand pounds on my chest everywhere i went and it wrecked me. so i ended up showing my anxiety and emotions outwardly and i could see her getting uncomfortable at times. i guess in her mind, we spent all this time apart, she's completely detached from me, and she comes back in my life and see's im a wreck. and i guess she wanted reconciliation to look different. i think she wanted us to get to know eachother again and start from scratch. 



and again, i loved her too much to not try. i wanted this too. but every few days my emotions would just be so bad. again i hid it the best i could but she could tell. and there were 2 times where my emotions showed as blunt moments. it wasn't intentional, it just happened. my therapist told me that sometimes depression can show as anger, and i guess it did (not trying to evade responsibility here, but this behavior is NOT like me at all). one time i told her ""my friends were actually here for me when you weren't"" and another time i told her ""my family seriously doubt your growth. just a year ago you were pulling all these stunts on me while i was going through such a hard time, they think you may not have changed."" (and its true, my family had concerns about her, but it's not like me AT ALL to talk like that). i think my nervous system just crashed really hard and instead of the constant sad emotions, it showed as bluntness 2 times. 



and that was the final straw i guess. my ex told me that she thinks ive changed a lot, personality wise. she said our emotions will never mesh, because of how fragile and emotional I've been, she said we will never align. she told me to find someone who is emotional like me. and she also told me that my bluntness is an indication of us speaking differently, and we need to date people who speak more like us. and i was really sad during this time so i didn't want to give bullshit reasons or act like i had an excuse, so i just kept saying sorry. i apologized wholeheartedly - both when my ""bad"" incident occurred, and during the end when she wanted to leave. i just said ""im sorry, i misspoke, i should have realized that this might be hurtful...etc"". i JUST apologized but she is so sure of no future with me that she left and she shut the door really hard. she was really cold too so i didn't get to explain anything. 



and now im 50 days no contact from all of that. and i guess i dont know what to do. my brain tells me that she apologized, she owned up to the past, and she wanted a clean slate. and 50% of the time, i DID give that clean slate and we had really nice soft loving convos. but i was guilty of the other 50% where i was just emotional. i was still my sweet self, i was still trying to show up, but most days i would literally have the worst breakdown and then i try to talk to her and words cant even come out of my mouth. im sad and still processing trauma and im like stuttering almost and trying to act normal and loveable. i never got to tell her why i was in so much pain on the inside. and i really want to. i know my pain and hurt was valid, but i guess i wanna reach out and tell her everything i was fighting on my own and how much hurt i was carrying and how it affected how i showed up. i want to tell her that the version of me she saw isn't the one to judge for compatibility. i want to tell her that i freaking love her and i want this and there's so much more to me. i want to fight for myself and for us. 



shes moving close to me soon and it makes me remember how things were before mom died. morning bagel dates, coffee runs, watching dumb cartoons together while eating takeout. those bummy days when she wasn't dressed up nicely and had no make up on is the version of her that i fell in love with. i want it all with her but she was just so cold when she left that i haven't had the courage to reach back out. i miss her terribly, I've been a mess again for these last 50 days, but im scared that if she's cold again, it could hurt my mental health even more. i just feel like if i was able to be a better and more composed version of myself, our reconciliation would have gone better. and maybe we could have built something stable and healthy this time. and it feels like im being forced to detach from my person, again, and this time it feels just so unfair. i just wanna fight for us.

What I've noticed is that when the older people in my organization find out I don't have kids (i.e. those who are 70 years old or older), they don't really say much.  Maybe some of that is from pity, I can't be certain.

But I do know that some of those elderly employees, they do talk about death and medical issues (which obviously correlate with suffering).  Oftentimes, they couch it in the form of jokes or sense of humor. (""Oh, my knees don't work the way that they used to, maybe I should get my TA teaching assistant to fetch my coffee for me too, hahahaha!"" or something like that.)  And those guys, when they hear I'm nearing 50 and don't have a kid and they invariably get the sense that I'm possibly AN, they seem to nod a tiny bit.

**And it got me thinking: Wouldn't the elderly and those who suffer from bad health intuitively understand AN mindsets?  I find it hard to believe that they never think of the benefits of AN.**

As in, if I were elderly and suffering from a variety of health problems, I'm not sure I can 'flip' my mindset and then suddenly talk about the joys of being a grandfather and holding a baby, when I am bright enough to realize that s/he will someday suffer the way that I'm suffering.  In other words, the ailing grandfathers out there who can be so proud to hold a grandchild seem to me to be a bit delusional.  Or a special kind of ignorant.

1n2v881,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1n2v881/surgery_that_works_willing_to_travel_and_pay/,Surgery that works? Willing to travel and pay.,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been dealing with a small sliding hiatal hernia for about 3 years, but it‚Äôs made my life tough. My symptoms aren‚Äôt just occasional reflux ‚Äî I have:

	‚Ä¢	Constant globus (that lump-in-the-throat feeling, right in the notch above my chest)

	‚Ä¢	Daily discomfort and pressure, sometimes sharp chest pain

	‚Ä¢	Swallowing issues ‚Äî I have to chew very carefully, and if I don‚Äôt (especially with meat like steak), I‚Äôll pay for it later that night or even the next day. It‚Äôll feel like my esophagus is bruised

I don‚Äôt really get the standard acid reflux symptoms unless I eat absolute garbage, drink coffee.

Some days are more manageable, but overall it‚Äôs been 24/7 for years. Medication hasn‚Äôt helped. Living healthy and quitting all bad stuff and staying hydrated with electrolyte (sea salt) water has helped a lot, but the problem persists. The globus persists.

I know the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù surgeries are things like fundoplication or LINX, but I‚Äôve also heard about newer procedures (TIF, cTIF, Stretta, magnetic sphincter devices, etc.). 

I‚Äôm wondering:

	‚Ä¢	Has anyone here had surgery or advanced procedures for a sliding hiatal hernia with stricture?

	‚Ä¢	What was your recovery like?

	‚Ä¢	Did it actually relieve the globus and swallowing problems, or just the reflux?

	‚Ä¢	Any regrets, or things you wish you had known beforehand?

1n2v6lr,https://i.redd.it/etkublk7avlf1.png,The Art of Conscious Connection: Why Intentional Relationships Beat Random Romance üí´,"
*When love becomes a deliberate choice rather than a chance encounter*

---

## The Myth of ""Falling"" in Love üí≠

We've all heard the phrase ""falling in love"" countless times. Movies sell it, songs celebrate it, and society romanticizes it. But here's a perspective that might change how you think about meaningful relationships: What if the best connections aren't about falling at all?

Think about it. When you fall, you lose control. You tumble unexpectedly. You might get hurt. You certainly don't choose your landing spot.

But what if there's a better way?

## Walking Into Love: The Power of Conscious Choice üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Imagine approaching relationships like you approach other important life decisions. You research before buying a house. You interview before taking a job. You think carefully before making major commitments.

Why should choosing a life partner be any different?

**Walking into love means:**
- Keeping your awareness sharp üëÅÔ∏è
- Making deliberate decisions about who deserves your energy
- Choosing to invest in someone even when emotions fluctuate
- Building connection step by intentional step

This isn't about being calculating or cold. It's about being smart with your heart.

## The Balance Between Destiny and Decision üéØ

Here's where things get interesting. Many people believe in one of two extremes:

**Camp 1:** ""Everything happens for a reason. If it's meant to be, it will be.""
**Camp 2:** ""We create our own reality through choices and actions.""

But what if both perspectives hold truth?

Consider this: Maybe we're naturally drawn to certain types of people or situations. Maybe timing, circumstances, and compatibility create windows of opportunity. But within those windows, we still choose what to do.

**The sweet spot is this:** Recognize the opportunities that feel right, then actively choose to pursue them.

## Why This Approach Creates Stronger Bonds üîó

When you consciously choose someone repeatedly - not just once, but daily - something powerful happens:

### 1. Commitment Becomes Intentional
Instead of staying because ""this is just how things are,"" you stay because you actively decide this person adds value to your life.

### 2. Appreciation Increases
When you recognize you're choosing to be with someone, you naturally become more grateful for their presence.

### 3. Resilience Grows
Relationships built on conscious choice weather storms better. When challenges arise, you remember why you chose this person in the first place.

### 4. Mutual Respect Deepens
When both people know they're actively chosen (not just tolerated), it creates a foundation of respect and security.

## Practical Steps for Conscious Connection üìù

### Daily Choice Practices:
- **Morning Intention:** Start each day by mentally acknowledging why you choose to invest in this relationship
- **Evening Reflection:** Before sleep, think of one specific reason you appreciate this person
- **Weekly Check-ins:** Ask yourself honestly: ""Am I choosing this relationship, or just defaulting to it?""

### During Conflicts:
- **Pause and Choose:** When frustrated, take a moment to remember why you originally chose this person
- **Communicate Choice:** Tell your partner, ""I'm choosing to work through this with you""
- **Focus Forward:** Instead of rehashing past issues, choose to build something better

### Long-term Maintenance:
- **Annual Relationship Review:** Like a business assessment, honestly evaluate what's working and what needs attention
- **Renewal Rituals:** Create meaningful ways to re-choose each other (anniversaries, special dates, spontaneous declarations)
- **Growth Mindset:** Choose to evolve together rather than expecting people to stay exactly the same

## The Universal Nature of This Approach üåç

This perspective on conscious choice in relationships isn't tied to any specific belief system. Whether you're:
- Religious or atheist
- Romantic or pragmatic  
- Optimistic or realistic

The principle remains valuable: **Intentional choices create stronger outcomes than passive acceptance.**

## Beyond Romance: Applying This to All Relationships üë•

This concept extends far beyond romantic partnerships:

**With Friends:** Choose to maintain friendships that genuinely enrich your life
**With Family:** Even with relatives, you can choose how much energy to invest
**With Colleagues:** Decide which professional relationships deserve your extra effort
**With Yourself:** Choose daily to invest in your own growth and wellbeing

## The Timeless Truth üï∞Ô∏è

Centuries from now, when technology has transformed how people meet and communicate, one thing will remain constant: **Quality relationships require conscious choice.**

Whether people are connecting through brain implants or telepathic networks, the fundamental human need for intentional, chosen connection will persist.

The methods may evolve, but the principle stands firm: **The best relationships happen when people walk toward each other with open eyes and deliberate hearts.**

## Your Action Plan for Today üéØ

1. **Identify Your Current Relationships:** List the important people in your life
2. **Assess Your Choices:** For each person, ask: ""Am I actively choosing this relationship?""
3. **Make Intentional Decisions:** Decide who deserves more of your conscious energy
4. **Communicate Your Choice:** Tell someone important that you actively choose to have them in your life
5. **Create Daily Practices:** Build small habits that reinforce your conscious choices

## The Ripple Effect üåä

When you approach relationships with this level of intentionality, something beautiful happens. You stop settling for mediocre connections. You invest more deeply in the relationships that matter. You become the kind of person others actively choose too.

This creates an upward spiral: Better choices lead to better relationships, which inspire even better choices.

## Final Thoughts: Your Relationship Philosophy üí≠

Every day, you're making choices about relationships - even when you think you're not choosing. The question isn't whether you'll choose, but whether you'll choose consciously.

**The next time someone important crosses your path, remember:** You don't have to fall into anything. You can walk forward with clarity, purpose, and intention.

In a world full of random connections and fleeting encounters, choosing to build something meaningful isn't just romantic - it's revolutionary.

Choose well. Choose consciously. Choose again tomorrow.

*What relationships in your life could benefit from more conscious choice? The power to transform your connections starts with your next decision.*

I killed a civilian.


Terminids invading a city, Command considered the mission trivial - a quick and easy start to my journey as a Helldiver. I landed in the middle of the city, dawning the rifle given to me on my 16th birthday. SEAF soldiers and citizens cheering at the sight of me. ""A real helldiver! we're all saved."" ""Thank liberty, they sent a helldiver."" there wasn't any way for them to know that I had showed up alone, with no clue as to what I was doing.

Bugs were everywhere, plumes of yellowish green smoke cradled the demolished city infrastructure. There was too much going on. Its as if every time I turned around, someone needed me, some people I saved, but others were just too far, or just too slow, or simply in an impossible situation. But whoever they were, it was all the same. I am the great hero who will swoop in and save them just in time, until I wasn't. I shot aimlessly into a crowd of bugs, trying to push them back as much as I could, but my rifle wasn't enough for the sheer number of bugs. Then, it happened. ir was a woman. Tall, skinny, curly black hair - The kinda woman you would see at a coffee shop, or a shopping center. She ran in past the barrel of my gun as i shot. Bullet must have hit her spine or heart or something, she died instantly.

I spent a good few days reading books on anatomy. Where could I have really shot her? could she have been alive and I just left her for dead? was it painless?

It helps to have people fight alongside you.

It's a reminder of what I fight for. cause not only am I fighting for the valor of super earth, im fighting for all these incredible people beside me.

I‚Äôve always been known to be an emotional person but also seem to fluctuate between this and extreme periods of‚Ä¶nonchalance? Disassociation? Basically sometimes I feel so burnt out and my brains like static, or sometimes I‚Äôm more depressed. I hope that‚Äôs making sense. 

Anyway, a few things have happened recently that make me wonder if I have some sort of anger-management issue and what should I be doing to get better and take care of myself. I‚Äôve always struggled with depression and anxiety but didn‚Äôt start acting aggressive or breaking things until maybe my early 20s? Anyway, here‚Äôs what happened 
- I yelled at a woman in a parking lot who told me that I couldn‚Äôt use the laundromat parking if I was going to the coffee shop. I had said sorry and was going to move my car but she just kept saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be towed next time‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a sign‚Ä¶.‚Äù And I absolutely blew up on her and drove off.
-one morning I was omw to work and this little Honda violently cut me off so I had to slam on my breaks and I honked at him.

-This guy in my neighborhood started backing up into me fast as hell and almost hit my dog while parallel parking. There were a lot of people outside so I came home. I sat down to write and angry nasty little note and was determined to go back out and key the car. Now I‚Äôm here just wondering what to make of this. 

I guess my question isn‚Äôt so much, do I have anger issues? But I wonder if there are others who can share their experience or feelings in that moment, when you start to get really angry?

* He signaled that it's OK and said to come take a walk with him
* I explained some shit about ""What do you think ""I got your back means"" and then made it super easy because he started cop-perspective shit and I was like, ""Never mind all that it can mean a lot of things but the 2 most important extremes depend on who is saying it, their character and their intentions
* Then I forgot if he pulled a vest out of the SUV we walked to first or I explained ""For instance, it could mean Double Dragon I got your back shit and he said he was familiar with that like on SNES or whatever
* Then I said something like, ""Or it can mean I got your back as in other people realized something too late and are like, ""Wait that's not fair we didn't know that was connected to this and so FTS we're not paying that much of a price so now we're also NWA and I got your back as in we'll kick your ass when the subway or bus comes and now your ass is up because the bus ran over your head and ""there you go"" ‚Äì we got your back up right there but in a way you didn't expect because you're stupid like that"" ... or something along that version
* Then I forgot if he got an armored vest that seemed like whoever made it doesn't care about cop arms or necks or collarbones and I'm not an expert on these things but it seemed like it could stop sidearms type stuff and slight above fore a few rounds but not much and so I interpreted that as if I showed him I wasn't armed, he was saying, ""perhaps"" that ""well if you were, we don't really have the type of protection we need if you were some King Kong type of big üí™ 
* So he motioned for a few times for the back up guys that it was not necessary and they kept their distance

* But then I saw this double dragon dude arm wrestler meme type dude at CVS and then this Spanish gentleman on some bench who knew what that WH ""God Bless you"" meant even though he said he was from El Salvador because I tried explaining it to him and he said in a way real fast that ""Yeah I know what that means, I don't have to step foot in WH hood in NYC to know""

1n2uthf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2uthf,Disaster Strikes,"Was about a mile from home with my son and my father, and all of sudden I saw smoke coming from my center console area. Heard a rough grind shortly thereafter and lost all power (not electrical power but driveline). Coasted to the side of the road quick and killed the engine. Hopped over to the engine and yanked the battery off. I could tell it was electrical in nature. I panicked a bit as I had my toddler in the car and didn‚Äôt know if it was going to stop or not‚Ä¶so figured disconnect was the fastest and safest route. 

Tow driver was quick, but fast forward to the cause. Lots of diagnostics but I figured I‚Äôd summarize here. The snow mode connector was corroded from something likely having spilled there. Eventually it shorted itself out, sparked and melted itself. That switch runs on the same CAN bus as the transmission. Cut the connector out and taped the wires off. Vehicle wouldn‚Äôt start. Yellow key of death. Had to open the IPDM in the engine bay and found the short had popped the A/T fuse. Vehicle cranked again upon replacement. I think the grinding might have been the Atessa AWD system engaging on dry pavement and binding but can‚Äôt be sure. Luckily we were going 30 mph and I had no issues pulling over. 

As convenient as that cup holder is, don‚Äôt spill stuff. Removal of that trim is only a few minutes, and I‚Äôd recommend anyone that has ever spilt anything in there to check them. Things would have been far worse if were at speed. A little dielectric grease from the factory would have saved this issue from ever occurring, but same goes for not spilling coffee in there. I can say nothing has spilled there for years, so the corrosion has been ongoing for a long time (you can see from the pictures). ",7,1756432335.0,G37,2,1.0,False

-i confessed under the influence of coffee(it was really strong coffee)
-she wanted time
-i gave her time
-we continue chatting
-she ghosts me
-she unghosts me
-she tells me:
1. I shouldn't waste my time on her cus she is not the girl of my dreams (personality wise I actually think she is, I haven't seen how she looks like yet though. I have however confirmed her identity through extensive research. I managed to dig up an image of the back of her head and she looks like she would look good)
2. It won't work out no matter how hard we try(she probably thinks this cus we are in different countries even though it is the same time zone)
3. Something to do with my parents idk(I think she thinks that cus she knows my parents are overprotective so she thinks my parents won't allow it)
-our relationship recovers fully(more or less)
-current time

Additional info to note:
1. Our relationship is really REALLY good. Like to the level where you would think we are in a relationship 
2. We both like the same things more or less
3. She is very good at many things like drawing and singing.
4. I am broke
5. She is broke
6. I learn martial arts
7. I got cool stick
8. We both play valorant(although I am focusing on my studies rn so I won't play for a while)

I genuinely think she is the one cus:
1. Our personalities are perfectly complementing
2. Our in game playstyle and agents we play perfectly matches each other as she plays support and I frag(I use sentinel, duelist and initiator and frag in every role)
3. She is the best friend I could ever want.
4. Our music tastes matches pretty well

So here is my question:
Should I continue to pursue her slowly(my plan is to just play the long game unless there is a danger to our relationship)? Or should I just be content with being friends and forget about being in a relationship. If you think I should pursue her, how should I do it? ",1,1756432224.0,TeenagersButBetter,1,1.0,False

It was suggested for me to post this here. First post on reddit continued.

I own an 80% stake in a property, my father owns 20%.

He has some issues. I live in the house on the property (few hundred acres) and he stays on the property here and there. Yesterday he came into my house, the blowup was inevitable as we have been having issues in the past. One thing led to another and I could see the confrontation about to unfold. I went into the bathroom and heard a huge commotion in the other room. I walked out of the bathroom to see him trashing the mudroom, I asked him to leave. He then proceeds to throw a full cup of hot coffee in my face, then whips the mug as hard as he can and just misses my feet, proceeds to get in my face taunting and trying to start a fist fight. Needless to stay its not an ideal situation. Im glad I was able to keep my composure.

Im trying to figure out my options. He wants to force a flash sale of the property and I would like to just buy him out.

Hes also talking setting up a room in the house since he owns 20% and pretty much taking control and taking over everything as he leads with his usual intimidation/manipulation tactics.

Ive been looking to chat gpt for some advice and also reached out to a real estate agent today to maybe just list the place and cut ties, just fully throw in the towel. I think a lawyer maybe my next step.

Looking for any advice on what the heck I should do here as I feel very confused about everything. Relationship advice and/or any experience in dealing with a buyout or force a flash sale. In Canada BTW.

# The beginning

(Ko)



	I was lying on a hard surface, pain radiated from my leg, crawling up through my body like fire. My vision blurred with every passing second, shrouding the faces around me.¬†

I tried to focus, but nothing came into view. A hand wrapped around mine, a small warm comfort anchoring me back to reality. My jaw clenched so tightly, pounding erupted behind my eyes. ‚Äò*God, make it stop*‚Äô

¬†	Every so often, a gasp slipped past my lips as the pain flared through my leg. Someone was near, moving, touching, heat rising, pressure shifting. With every pounding beat of my heart fire raced through my veins. *‚ÄòPlease I beg of you‚Ä¶. make it stop!‚Äô*¬†

I was gasping for air. ‚Äò*Air! I can‚Äôt breathe! Someone do something!‚Äô* Voices echoed around me rising to an inaudible mumble. Darkness blooming at the corners of my vision slowly creeping in. I blinked. Nothing. Again. Again. I kept trying to force it back but it was slowly¬† consuming me, breath by breath, heartbeat by heartbeat-¬†

‚ÄúFREEZE!¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably thinking, *‚ÄòHey the book was just getting good.‚Äô*

Well, sorry ‚Äî you can‚Äôt start a story in the middle.‚Äù¬†

We‚Äôll get back to this later. For now let's start from the very beginning.

My name is Kaoriko Wells, Ko, for short. I‚Äôm twenty one years old and here is my survival story‚Ä¶ or so I thought.



‡¶ì¬†

The light salty breeze whipped my hair around as I sat on the edge of the pool. The sun was high in the sky, bright and warm‚Äî it reminded me of that song, *You Are My Sunshine.* I was on a cruise through Alaska. A trip I'd won in one of those cheesy radio contests. Be the hundredth caller, win a free vacation. I still don‚Äôt know how I pulled it off, but here I am. ‚ÄúYou know what the best part is? I made an unexpected friend.‚Äù¬†

Her name is Amillia Wald, a Canadian. She spotted me reading *To Kill a Mockingbird,* apparently one of her favorites, and that's how we started talking. Well, she did most of the talking, the rest is history.¬†

I learned that she is on this cruise because she wanted a vacation from her family. I wish I could live frivolously like that. She comes from money, apparently. You wouldn‚Äôt guess, she doesn't act like it, but then again you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. She dressed like anyone else, simple clothes, nothing flashy. But her eyes? They were something else. Crystal blue, and too honest to hide anything.¬†

I was stretched out on a pool chair when something caught my eye, a black crow, gliding across the crystal-blue sky. It started to circle the boat. Odd, seeing one this far out at sea, but hey anything‚Äôs possible these days. I made a mental note to tell Amilia, weird stuff like that always caught her attention, but she‚Äôd gone to take a nap earlier.¬†

I was just about to pick my book back up when the ship‚Äôs speakers crackled to life, interrupting the quiet. A raspy voice, kind of like the lady from Monsters, Inc., you know the one, filled the ship‚Äôs speakers, cutting through the calm.¬†

‚ÄúAll passengers please head to the party deck. All passengers please head to the party deck.‚Äù The intercom shut off just as quickly. All around me, people groaned and peeled themselves from their chairs, packing towels and drinks. I took my time slipping on my cover-up and gathering my things. I didn‚Äôt want to get caught in the sluggish wave of people heading for the party deck.¬†

When I started heading out, not many people were around. But the closer I got to the destination, the crowd thickened astronomically, like rush hour in New York City. The closer I got to the stairs, the more people started shoving and elbowing their way through.¬†

	People suck some days.¬†

	I was surprised I found a seat so quickly, I guess everyone was trying to sit at the front. Mine was near the back, but that was fine. I‚Äôm okay with just listening.¬†

I scanned the room, watching people. Observing them. The raspy voice from earlier came over the speakers again, announcing that the captain would be here shortly. As she moved away from the mic, it gave a sharp screech of feedback, like nails of a chalkboard.¬†

While I sat there, a man filing past almost fell on top of me from the force of the impatient crowd.¬†

Assholes.¬†

The more I looked around, the more I noticed how hastily the stage had been put together, like they were rushing. I pondered as to why.¬†

The captain was taking a while, so I made a mental note of my surroundings. An old habit. Something my dad taught me.¬†

‚ÄúGood afternoon,‚Äù the captain finally said as he stepped up. ‚ÄúThanks for coming on short notice. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying your vacation. I hate to interrupt your leisure time, but there are some pressing matters I need to address.‚Äù

A hush fell.¬†

‚ÄúThere was a report from the mainland, a virus outbreak. To make sure no one on this ship is infected, we‚Äôll be quarantining for one week. Please stay in your cabins. Food, water, and anything else you need will be brought to you. If you feel sick, contact a staff member. We have a doctor on board.‚Äù

Murmurs began spreading like wildfire.¬†

‚ÄúNot much is known about this virus,‚Äù the captain continued. ‚ÄúIt just broke out a few days ago. If you have questions, I‚Äôll answer as best I can.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the crowd erupted. Voices rose into a wall of noise. Fear. Confusion. Anger. The captain and his staff tried to quiet them down, asking everyone to speak one at a time, but no one listened.¬†

I stayed silent. No point in adding to the noise. Of course I had questions, but I‚Äôd find the answers myself, Research always tells the truth better than people do.

The captain pulled out a bullhorn and blasted it.¬†

The room fell silent.¬†

‚ÄúCan we do this one question at a time, in a civil manner‚Ä¶.. With raised hands?‚Äù the captain asked, trying to regain control. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre scared and confused. We all are.‚Äù

A man near the front slowly raised his hand, like he wasn't sure if he should. He waited quietly until the captain gave him a nod.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is the virus?‚Äù he asked

‚ÄúCurrently, we don't know,‚Äù the captain replied. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs believed to be bloodborne.‚Äù

That word hit like a gunshot

The room exploded in noise again‚Äî panicked voices, frantic questions, people talking over each other.¬†

And then, to my right, the same guy who nearly fell on me earlier‚Ä¶ doubled over.¬†

He started hacking.

Harsh, wet wrenching coughs.

Then came the blood.

Thick and sudden, it splattered onto the floor between his shoes. People scattered like rats, scrambling away from him in all directions. Screams filled the room. Chairs toppled. Someone cried out for help.¬†

I didn‚Äôt move. I just watched.¬†

‚ÄúPlease stay calm!‚Äù shouted an attendant. ‚ÄúRemain calm!‚Äù

Total chaos. Attendants wove through the screaming crowd toward the man who was coughing blood. People were yelling, trying to get him away from him.¬†

I grabbed my stuff and pushed my way through the mob, back toward my cabin. Elbows, bags, panic‚Äî it was like swimming upstream in a stampede.¬†

Somehow, I made it back in one piece. I‚Äôd barely shut the door when someone knocked. I spun on my heels.¬†

It was Amillia.

I opened the door.¬†

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù she said. ‚Äú I saw you leaving when the chaos started. Since I'm alone on this boat, I figured‚Ä¶ if we‚Äôre really getting quarantined‚Ä¶ or if crap hits the fan, we should stick together. They say two heads are better than one, eh?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure. You wanna come in?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy not. Eh?‚Äù She grinned as she stepped inside.¬†

I closed the door behind her. Conversation wasn‚Äôt exactly my strong suit, but I tried.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanna check the news? See if they‚Äôre saying anything about the virus?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure, why not., eh?‚Äù¬†

I grabbed the remote off the bed and flopped down. The TV flicked on.¬†

*‚ÄúThis is World News Ten. I'm Rebecka Porter. Tonight's top story is the mysterious virus that‚Äôs rapidly spreading worldwide. Let‚Äôs go to Joe at Presbyterian Hospital in Virginia for more details.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThanks, Rebecka. I‚Äôve spoken with doctors here, and honestly, they still don‚Äôt know much. They haven‚Äôt identified the origin, but symptoms include high fever and coughing. It‚Äôs believed to be bloodborne, though that‚Äôs unconfirmed. Research is ongoing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThanks, Joe. Stay tuned on the World News Ten app. That‚Äôs all for tonight. Stay safe.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWell alrighty then,‚Äù Amillia muttered. .

‚ÄúWhat do you wanna do?‚Äù I asked. .

‚ÄúLet's make a game plan. Just in case.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou should get changed. Then we‚Äôll plan.‚Äù

I grabbed clothes and changed in the bathroom, ripped jeans, a t-shirt, same as always. When I came out, Amillia raised an eyebrow.¬†

‚ÄúThat didn‚Äôt take long.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLet's get started..‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst step‚Ä¶ supplies,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFood, water, anything we might need. Let‚Äôs pack it now so we can grab it and go if needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll start here. You go to your room?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù She left.¬†

I raided the mini-fridge: two bottles of water, a few Coke Zeros, sparkling water, even a couple of mini liquor bottles‚Ä¶ survival fuel, I guess.. I added instant coffee, a couple mints, socks, and a jacket. From the bathroom, I grabbed toothpaste, a toothbrush, and the tiny hotel soap.¬†

I was just zipping my bag when Amillia burst back in like she owned the place.¬†

‚ÄúI got my stuff. What about you?‚Äù¬†

I pointed at the bed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äù

‚ÄúSplit is down the middle, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure‚Äù

We divided up the supplies and stuffed our bags. I tossed mine on the bed for easy access.¬†

Then‚Äî

BANG!

A fist slammed against the door.¬†

I froze.¬†

I quietly crept toward the peephole and looked through.

My stomach dropped.¬†

A man stood there‚Ä¶ the same one from earlier? His face and hands were covered in blood.¬†

‚ÄúOPEN UP! HELP ME, PLEASE! I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!‚Äù¬†

Behind him, people ran back and forth in a panic. Someone slammed into him, knocking him to the ground.¬†

*What the hell is happening out there?*

I turned to Amillia. My face must‚Äôve said it all.

‚ÄúGrab your bag,‚Äù she said.¬†

Fear surged like a drumbeat in my chest. I couldn‚Äôt move.

Another band rattled the door.¬†

I looked again. He was back. Pounding. Screaming. Unhinged.¬†

‚ÄúWe need to barricade the door,‚Äù Amillia said.¬†

I finally moved. We flipped a table, shoved a chair in front of it.¬†

‚ÄúLets figure out an escape route,‚Äù I said, adjusting my bag.¬†

We both stood there, staring at the door. Heart pounding. Breath held. Trying to figure out how the hell we were going to survive.¬†

Today just hit a fever pitch over something so dumb and it has me completely doubting myself. 

I asked my husband to turn the heat on for some sausage. ‚ÄúCan you start the sausage?‚Äù And he starts going on about how the coffee pot is dirty etc. I said ‚Äúyeah I know. Are the sausages going?‚Äù He then insisted I never asked him. I told him that maybe he didn‚Äôt hear me. He insists that I never said it. Then conceded that I did say something, but it was ‚Äúcan you start the coffee?‚Äù. He has a history of gaslighting but never anything so meaningless like this so I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I said he must‚Äôve misheard me. He continued to insist that I absolutely didn‚Äôt say what I thought I did. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs due to the gaslighting about other things but it just set me off. I rolled my eyes and went to storm off. He put his arm infront of the door and wouldn‚Äôt move so I could leave and I just saw red and grabbed him arm and pushed it away, apparently scratching him in the process although I didn‚Äôt break skin or leave any marks. He asked why I‚Äôd ‚Äúattack‚Äù him and I sarcastically said ‚ÄúI must just hate you‚Äù. 

I know all of this was absolutely not okay and absolutely had the intention of going to apologize when I returned to the room. I have a history of abuse with my past partner where he would pick me up or ‚Äúrestrain‚Äù if I tried to leave after he was physically abusive. My spouse knows this but despite that he will still try to stop me from leaving to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me work on avoidance. 

It escalated when I went back in the room. Before I could apologize my spouse starts asking me ‚Äúwhy would you just attack me like that completely unprovoked?‚Äù And it just made me feel so defensive. I kept trying to say I know it wasn‚Äôt okay, but it wasn‚Äôt unprovoked. I was reacting to being trapped in a room, albeit an extremely inappropriate reaction. But he just kept insisting I attacked him etc. and wouldn‚Äôt let me talk until he said ‚Äúyou need to apologize for acting crazy‚Äù and I just saw red again and said ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs not what happened‚Äù. 

In literally a millisecond he grabbed my arm and squeezed hard enough that it‚Äôs now bruised. And told me ‚Äúyou hurt me like this and you won‚Äôt say sorry?‚Äù. I was just genuinely taken aback. He‚Äôs never put his hands on me like that. I just got my stuff and left. As I was leaving he said something like ‚Äúyou know I don‚Äôt like doing that but I had to show you‚Äù. Again I know it doesn‚Äôt excuse my behavior, but he even showed me ‚Äúthe scratch‚Äù I left him and there wasn‚Äôt even a mark let alone bruising or broken skin. As I was leaving he started to make jokes and try to be all charming like ‚Äúso no kiss? Not even a teeny tiny one?‚Äù 

I just can‚Äôt do this. I don‚Äôt want to go home. He says I‚Äôm majorly overreacting. That I am the abusive one. That I misunderstood and that he never put his arm out to stop me leaving. It has me feeling like I‚Äôm crazy. Like I am abusive and I am overdramatic. 

Whenever we have fights that get out of hand, yelling, name calling, he always does this, just acts like everything fine. Until the next fight. Then he throws it in my face and tells me I‚Äôm avoidant and that he never gets to have ‚Äúconclusions‚Äù in our arguments like it‚Äôs my fault. 

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I know what I did was wrong but I panicked. What he did feels so different. It was a reaction of escalation (even though those aren‚Äôt excuses to get physical), it was over ten minutes later. It felt like a retaliation. Like a way to punish me for what I did. 

Ive gone to therapy for years and I‚Äôve done so much reading on emotional abuse after my last relationship and I feel like I try to avoid anything like that. But inside our relationships he pushes me till I explode (I know that‚Äôs a tactic abusers use) but I truly don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs the abuser here anymore, maybe he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúpush‚Äù and I just explode and try to justify it in my head. I genuinely have never felt more crazy than right now. Either I‚Äôm completely psychotic and living a delusion or he‚Äôs lying to me.

1n2up3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/1n2up3k/should_i_take_concerta_dose_2/,Should I take Concerta Dose #2?,"Hi there! Just discovered this subreddit with huge relief as I am desperately in need of help. I am having the scariest week of my life with a deadline due in 20 hours and I can't tell if taking Concerta for the second time will worsen things. Sorry in advance for the chaotic post, I would really appreciate any kind of help.

  
TLDR; Been diagnosed for a week. Started Ritalin and Concerta as a trial run in one week. Ritalin 10mg bad, Ritalin 5mg better, Concerta 27mg (only took once) bad. Stressful 20 hours left, should I take Concerta #2 today, or would stopping the med after a day make things worse. 



I recently got diagnosed at the ripe age of 27 (f). My psychiatrist prescribed me both Ritalin and Concerta so I could try both out. She said to use Ritalin 10mg for 3-4 days, take notes on its effects, then move onto Concerta 27mg. On my 4th day of Ritalin, I was feeling extra horrible (in addition to the other 3 days); heart pounding, heavy anxiety and panic, feeling tired, and worst of all, feeling super depressed/low/melancholic. These effects were all visible since day 1, but day 4 got so out of hand that I just had to contact my doc. I was crying over nothing, wanting to go outside but couldn't summon myself to choose an outfit, which got me into a worse crying session. My doctor told me that if it's been like this 4 days, they tend to assume the med isn't appropriate for the patient. So, she said to take half the pill (5mg) the next day, observe, then move onto concerta the following day...

 

Long story short, I took half dosage for \*2 days\* instead of 1 (just because I think a single day of observation would not be helpful). Then began Concerta yesterday. The half dosage was by far the best among the three experiences so far. Meaning, I was able to focus and work really well \*after\* the first four hours of horrible anxiety. 

  
Day 1 of Concerta 27mg was a wild ride. Took it at 9am, felt terrible anxiety and low mood for about 3 hours. Then felt better after talking to a friend who told me to ride it out for the first four hours. This lasted like 50 mins, only for me to feel like my heart was turning brown from so much internal darkness :'(

Two hours later I felt a numbness in my jaw, hands and arms. Felt like I was on morphine or something. This lasted like 15-20 mins.

An hour later (3pm) I began to focus well actually. I was still stimming and moving my legs in my seat (as I always do). I worked really good for about an hour and a half, then felt super sleepy, hungry, and bored (4:30). From then onwards I worked on and off with distractions and tiredness. With good friends and music I was able to get through most of it, which someone suggested I needed to stay positive and I might be feeling this terribly because it's also a really important/stressful week for me.

  
Okay, my question is: Should I take my second dose of Concerta today? My deadline is due in 20 hours but the negative effects of this med lasted for literally 6 hours, and I was only able to work after that (with feelings of anxiety gradually deteriorating). I hate the feeling it gives me, but I also don't wanna stop taking it in a whim, especially since I just started taking it.

  
\*\*Mind that I really am deeply stressed about this deadline, so that might have a huge effect. Also drinking coffee of any kind always makes me jittery and anxious as well- so I only take it to focus. As far as my experience with it, weed has also not been kind to me. I'm sorry this is such a long post. I really do hope someone experienced can give me insight.",1,1756431996.0,TwoXADHD,5,1.0,False

1n2uo9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1n2uo9t/reporting_on_my_game_as_colonial_haiti_in_19/,Reporting on my game as Colonial Haiti in 1.9,"First time doing a full run as Haiti, though I've done similar with Gaza/Transvaal before. The general idea is that Haiti's primary culture has african ancestry, and thus can incorporate most African states in 5 years instead of 20. It also starts with much better tech than any african-led nation in Africa, and has slavery banned from the get go. Through early conquest and incorporation, you can quickly boost your **incorporated population**, which second to colonial innovations, is the most important thing when it comes to colonization speed. I remember hitting 33M incorporated pops while having colonial institution at level 3, which already produced the maximum daily colonization amount without ever needing to get to lvl 4 and 5.

[Map at end date](https://preview.redd.it/r89n7pmvtulf1.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=250a7f7cf82f827dd7c6bc817b4b1e1857ef90f1)

Before 1.9, a common strategy was to invade Gaza to reach Transvaal and Oranje, two resource rich states easy to annex. But now Gaza starts with a larger army, making it harder to naval invade early game, and GB has a 25 year treaty protecting Transvaal and Oranje. The path I took this game is to first rush the colonization institution law,  start a colony in Kenya to compete with/land lock GB, then take Zanzibar from Oman.

(PS: When colonizing Kenya, do it from Zanzibar only, if you annex Geledi and Borana you might colonize from their borders too, splitting up your progress and allowing GB to reach inner into the continent, it is better at first to protectorate them)

Next step was to settle a colony near Dahomey and invade them by land, though you could probably do it by sea also. Then set foot in Ethiopia too through Isaaq or Warsangali. From there it is easy to annex and incorporate every African nation you can reach in Ethiopia, Senegal and Niger. You might even be opportunistic enough to steal some Nile states from Egypt; as you conquer more lands your army size will also grow to match it.

But we must talk about the French problem. Obviously, one has to default on the ridiculous debt Haiti has from France. This however, will make them declare war on you multiple times throughout the game. You need a sugar daddy to defend you; befriend the brits, and if need be, become a Spanish protectorate; you will soon out scale them in every conceivable way and it will be relatively easy to break free. Later on, you will be much stronger and be able to extract colonial territory from France whenever they lose.

The mid-game is a quest to build up universities and rush malaria prevention and beat GB at colonizing Africa. The new treaties come in handy here, at some point I struck a deal with GB stopping their colonization of Herero and Namaquad. In this particular game I was not able to beat Portugal out of Africa without incurring the wrath of great powers. I instead reached Gaza through land colonization. From Gaza you should take Transvaal. Transvaal or Oranje are of utmost importance. It will allow you to form the De Beers Mining corporation, though you should do it only after 1888, in order to get the most important man in colonial Africa:

[The man, the legend](https://preview.redd.it/2fiquco62vlf1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c7d0a662ae38d36b02652781f9e49750df564b)

Cecil is a historical character, the CEO of de Beers, and leader of the industrialists while alive. He should also be your president. Combined his traits give you +20% colonial growth speed (crucial for outspeeding GB), -25% decree costs, +10% prestige from military, +5% prestige of all sources, and +25% Infamy decay (which is also crucial as the early game conquest puts in at or near pariah status).

Owning most Africa allows you to become the top producer of rubber and coffee, maybe tea too, though the EIC will always remain tough to beat. From there the game becomes more stable and dependent on how hard you can scale and beat the other great powers, though I was unable to beat GB and Germany at the end of this run, though it is probably very doable.

At the end I broke up Brazil and the US by freeing African countries, with the goal of puppeting/anexing them in the future, though I ran out of time. Thank you for reading my TED talk.

# The beginning

(Ko)



I was lying on a hard surface, pain radiated from my leg, crawling up through my body like fire. My vision blurred with every passing second, shrouding the faces around me.¬†

I tried to focus, but nothing came into view. A hand wrapped around mine, a small warm comfort anchoring me back to reality. My jaw clenched so tightly, pounding erupted behind my eyes. ‚Äò*God, make it stop*‚Äô

¬†Every so often, a gasp slipped past my lips as the pain flared through my leg. Someone was near, moving, touching, heat rising, pressure shifting. With every pounding beat of my heart fire raced through my veins. *‚ÄòPlease I beg of you‚Ä¶. make it stop!‚Äô*¬†

I was gasping for air. ‚Äò*Air! I can‚Äôt breathe! Someone do something!‚Äô* Voices echoed around me rising to an inaudible mumble. Darkness blooming at the corners of my vision slowly creeping in. I blinked. Nothing. Again. Again. I kept trying to force it back but it was slowly¬† consuming me, breath by breath, heartbeat by heartbeat-¬†

‚ÄúFREEZE!¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably thinking, *‚ÄòHey the book was just getting good.‚Äô*

Well, sorry ‚Äî you can‚Äôt start a story in the middle.‚Äù¬†

We‚Äôll get back to this later. For now, let's start from the very beginning.

My name is Kaoriko Wells, Ko, for short. I‚Äôm twenty-one years old and here is my survival story‚Ä¶ or so I thought.





The light salty breeze whipped my hair around as I sat on the edge of the pool. The sun was high in the sky, bright and warm‚Äî it reminded me of that song, *You Are My Sunshine.* I was on a cruise through Alaska. A trip I'd won in one of those cheesy radio contests. Be the hundredth caller, win a free vacation. I still don‚Äôt know how I pulled it off, but here I am. ‚ÄúYou know what the best part is? I made an unexpected friend.‚Äù¬†

Her name is Amillia Wald, a Canadian. She spotted me reading *To Kill a Mockingbird,* apparently one of her favorites, and that's how we started talking. Well, she did most of the talking, the rest is history.¬†

I learned that she is on this cruise because she wanted a vacation from her family. I wish I could live frivolously like that. She comes from money, apparently. You wouldn‚Äôt guess, she doesn't act like it, but then again you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. She dressed like anyone else, simple clothes, nothing flashy. But her eyes? They were something else. Crystal blue, and too honest to hide anything.¬†

I was stretched out on a pool chair when something caught my eye, a black crow, gliding across the crystal-blue sky. It started to circle the boat. Odd, seeing one this far out at sea, but hey anything‚Äôs possible these days. I made a mental note to tell Amilia, weird stuff like that always caught her attention, but she‚Äôd gone to take a nap earlier.¬†

I was just about to pick my book back up when the ship‚Äôs speakers crackled to life, interrupting the quiet. A raspy voice, kind of like the lady from Monsters, Inc., you know the one, filled the ship‚Äôs speakers, cutting through the calm.¬†

‚ÄúAll passengers please head to the party deck. All passengers please head to the party deck.‚Äù The intercom shut off just as quickly. All around me, people groaned and peeled themselves from their chairs, packing towels and drinks. I took my time slipping on my cover-up and gathering my things. I didn‚Äôt want to get caught in the sluggish wave of people heading for the party deck.¬†

When I started heading out, not many people were around. But the closer I got to the destination, the crowd thickened astronomically, like rush hour in New York City. The closer I got to the stairs, the more people started shoving and elbowing their way through.¬†

People suck some days.¬†

I was surprised I found a seat so quickly, I guess everyone was trying to sit at the front. Mine was near the back, but that was fine. I‚Äôm okay with just listening.¬†

I scanned the room, watching people. Observing them. The raspy voice from earlier came over the speakers again, announcing that the captain would be here shortly. As she moved away from the mic, it gave a sharp screech of feedback, like nails of a chalkboard.¬†

While I sat there, a man filing past almost fell on top of me from the force of the impatient crowd.¬†

Assholes.¬†

The more I looked around, the more I noticed how hastily the stage had been put together, like they were rushing. I pondered as to why.¬†

The captain was taking a while, so I made a mental note of my surroundings. An old habit. Something my dad taught me.¬†

‚ÄúGood afternoon,‚Äù the captain finally said as he stepped up. ‚ÄúThanks for coming on short notice. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying your vacation. I hate to interrupt your leisure time, but there are some pressing matters I need to address.‚Äù

A hush fell.¬†

‚ÄúThere was a report from the mainland, a virus outbreak. To make sure no one on this ship is infected, we‚Äôll be quarantining for one week. Please stay in your cabins. Food, water, and anything else you need will be brought to you. If you feel sick, contact a staff member. We have a doctor on board.‚Äù

Murmurs began spreading like wildfire.¬†

‚ÄúNot much is known about this virus,‚Äù the captain continued. ‚ÄúIt just broke out a few days ago. If you have questions, I‚Äôll answer as best I can.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the crowd erupted. Voices rose into a wall of noise. Fear. Confusion. Anger. The captain and his staff tried to quiet them down, asking everyone to speak one at a time, but no one listened.¬†

I stayed silent. No point in adding to the noise. Of course I had questions, but I‚Äôd find the answers myself, Research always tells the truth better than people do.

The captain pulled out a bullhorn and blasted it.¬†

The room fell silent.¬†

‚ÄúCan we do this one question at a time, in a civil manner‚Ä¶.. With raised hands?‚Äù the captain asked, trying to regain control. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre scared and confused. We all are.‚Äù

A man near the front slowly raised his hand, like he wasn't sure if he should. He waited quietly until the captain gave him a nod.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is the virus?‚Äù he asked

‚ÄúCurrently, we don't know,‚Äù the captain replied. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs believed to be bloodborne.‚Äù

That word hit like a gunshot

The room exploded in noise again‚Äî panicked voices, frantic questions, people talking over each other.¬†

And then, to my right, the same guy who nearly fell on me earlier‚Ä¶ doubled over.¬†

He started hacking.

Harsh, wet wrenching coughs.

Then came the blood.

Thick and sudden, it splattered onto the floor between his shoes. People scattered like rats, scrambling away from him in all directions. Screams filled the room. Chairs toppled. Someone cried out for help.¬†

I didn‚Äôt move. I just watched.¬†

‚ÄúPlease stay calm!‚Äù shouted an attendant. ‚ÄúRemain calm!‚Äù

Total chaos. Attendants wove through the screaming crowd toward the man who was coughing blood. People were yelling, trying to get him away from him.¬†

I grabbed my stuff and pushed my way through the mob, back toward my cabin. Elbows, bags, panic‚Äî it was like swimming upstream in a stampede.¬†

Somehow, I made it back in one piece. I‚Äôd barely shut the door when someone knocked. I spun on my heels.¬†

It was Amillia.

I opened the door.¬†

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù she said. ‚Äú I saw you leaving when the chaos started. Since I'm alone on this boat, I figured‚Ä¶ if we‚Äôre really getting quarantined‚Ä¶ or if crap hits the fan, we should stick together. They say two heads are better than one, eh?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure. You wanna come in?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhy not. Eh?‚Äù She grinned as she stepped inside.¬†

I closed the door behind her. Conversation wasn‚Äôt exactly my strong suit, but I tried.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanna check the news? See if they‚Äôre saying anything about the virus?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSure, why not., eh?‚Äù¬†

I grabbed the remote off the bed and flopped down. The TV flicked on.¬†

*‚ÄúThis is World News Ten. I'm Rebecka Porter. Tonight's top story is the mysterious virus that‚Äôs rapidly spreading worldwide. Let‚Äôs go to Joe at Presbyterian Hospital in Virginia for more details.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThanks, Rebecka. I‚Äôve spoken with doctors here, and honestly, they still don‚Äôt know much. They haven‚Äôt identified the origin, but symptoms include high fever and coughing. It‚Äôs believed to be bloodborne, though that‚Äôs unconfirmed. Research is ongoing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThanks, Joe. Stay tuned on the World News Ten app. That‚Äôs all for tonight. Stay safe.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWell alrighty then,‚Äù Amillia muttered. .

‚ÄúWhat do you wanna do?‚Äù I asked. .

‚ÄúLet's make a game plan. Just in case.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou should get changed. Then we‚Äôll plan.‚Äù

I grabbed clothes and changed in the bathroom, ripped jeans, a t-shirt, same as always. When I came out, Amillia raised an eyebrow.¬†

‚ÄúThat didn‚Äôt take long.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLet's get started..‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst step‚Ä¶ supplies,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFood, water, anything we might need. Let‚Äôs pack it now so we can grab it and go if needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll start here. You go to your room?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù She left.¬†

I raided the mini-fridge: two bottles of water, a few Coke Zeros, sparkling water, even a couple of mini liquor bottles‚Ä¶ survival fuel, I guess.. I added instant coffee, a couple mints, socks, and a jacket. From the bathroom, I grabbed toothpaste, a toothbrush, and the tiny hotel soap.¬†

I was just zipping my bag when Amillia burst back in like she owned the place.¬†

‚ÄúI got my stuff. What about you?‚Äù¬†

I pointed at the bed. ‚ÄúThere‚Äù

‚ÄúSplit is down the middle, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure‚Äù

We divided up the supplies and stuffed our bags. I tossed mine on the bed for easy access.¬†

Then‚Äî

BANG!

A fist slammed against the door.¬†

I froze.¬†

I quietly crept toward the peephole and looked through.

My stomach dropped.¬†

Our neighborhoods should be places where families feel safe walking after dark. I‚Äôll work to restore trust in policing while expanding non‚Äëemergency response teams, and push for better lighting, safer intersections, and clear paths for walkers, bikers, and strollers.
-Infrastructure That Works
City services should respond like a neighbor, not a call center. I‚Äôll work with the city council to map repair needs street by street, make fixing potholes and broken sidewalks a priority, and follow up until the job is done.
-Real Support for Small Businesses
From Friendly Center to corner coffee shops, our small businesses are the heartbeat of District 4. I‚Äôll fight for streamlined permitting, startup kiosks, and city‚Äëbacked promotion small businesses.

*Discover the remarkable ways simple physical contact reshapes your brain, body, and relationships*

---

## The Invisible Power Running Through Your Fingertips ‚ö°

Every day, millions of people walk past each other without realizing they're missing out on one of nature's most powerful healing mechanisms. It's not a pill, therapy, or expensive treatment‚Äîit's something so simple that we often overlook its profound impact: human touch.

When two people make physical contact, something extraordinary happens beneath the surface. Your body doesn't just register the sensation; it launches a complex biological response that can literally change your chemistry within seconds.

## What Really Happens When Skin Meets Skin üß¨

The moment someone places their hand on your shoulder or gives you a hug, your nervous system springs into action. Your brain receives signals that trigger the release of oxytocin‚Äîoften called the ""bonding hormone""‚Äîwhile simultaneously reducing cortisol, your body's primary stress chemical.

This isn't just feel-good science talk. Researchers have documented measurable changes: blood pressure drops, heart rate stabilizes, and your immune system gets a boost. Your body literally becomes healthier through touch.

Think about the last time someone gave you an unexpected hug during a difficult day. That instant relief you felt wasn't imagination‚Äîit was biochemistry in action.

## The Touch Deficit Crisis üì±

Modern society has created an unspoken problem: we're experiencing a touch famine. Digital communication has replaced many face-to-face interactions, and social conventions often discourage casual physical contact between non-romantic partners.

Yet our bodies haven't evolved past needing this fundamental form of connection. We're essentially running on empty in terms of physical affection, and it shows up in increased anxiety, depression, and general stress levels across populations.

## Breaking Down the Walls We Build üß±

Many people hesitate to initiate physical contact because they fear rejection or misinterpretation. This creates a cycle where everyone wants more connection but nobody takes the first step.

The solution requires small acts of courage: offering a handshake that lingers an extra second, giving a friend a genuine hug instead of an air kiss, or simply placing a comforting hand on someone's arm during conversation.

These moments don't require grand gestures or perfect timing‚Äîjust the willingness to be genuinely present with another human being.

## The Physiology of Healing Touch üíö

Your skin contains specialized nerve fibers designed specifically to process gentle, caring touch. These nerves connect directly to brain regions that regulate emotion and stress response. When activated, they create a cascade of positive changes throughout your entire system.

Pain literally decreases when you experience caring touch. This is why a parent's gentle rub can soothe a child's injury, or why holding someone's hand during medical procedures reduces their discomfort.

## Daily Applications That Transform Relationships ‚ú®

**Morning Connections:** Start your day with intentional physical contact. A genuine hug with your partner, roommate, or family member sets a positive tone that can influence your entire day's interactions.

**Workplace Wellness:** A brief, appropriate touch on the shoulder while offering encouragement or congratulations can strengthen professional relationships and boost team morale.

**Friend Support:** When friends share difficult news, resist the urge to just offer words. Sometimes a sincere hug communicates support more effectively than any advice.

**Family Bonding:** Regular physical affection with family members‚Äîespecially children‚Äîbuilds emotional security that lasts a lifetime.

## The Ripple Effect of One Touch üåä

When you receive caring physical contact, your mood improves, making you more likely to extend kindness to others. This creates a positive feedback loop that can influence everyone in your social circle.

Couples who maintain regular physical affection report higher relationship satisfaction and better conflict resolution skills. They're not just happier together‚Äîthey're better equipped to handle life's challenges as a team.

## Overcoming Touch Hesitation ü§≤

If you're uncomfortable with physical contact, start small. Work on being more present during handshakes, offer high-fives for celebrations, or simply sit closer to people during conversations.

Pay attention to others' comfort levels and respect boundaries, but don't let fear prevent you from offering appropriate physical connection when it could provide comfort or joy.

## The Universal Language of Care üåç

Physical touch transcends cultural and language barriers. A gentle pat on the back communicates support whether you're in New York or Tokyo. A warm handshake conveys respect and openness regardless of spoken language.

This makes touch one of our most powerful tools for building bridges between different communities and creating understanding across divides.

## Building Touch-Rich Environments üè†

Create spaces and routines that naturally encourage healthy physical contact. Sit together on the same couch instead of separate chairs. Offer to help with tasks that involve working side by side. Choose activities that include appropriate physical elements‚Äîdancing, sports, or collaborative projects.

## The Long-Term Health Investment üìà

Regular physical affection isn't just pleasant‚Äîit's preventive medicine. People with strong physical connection networks show better immune function, lower rates of depression, and even increased longevity.

Think of every hug, handshake, and gentle touch as a deposit in your long-term health account.

## Practical Steps for Today üéØ

**Immediate Actions:**
- Give longer, more intentional hugs instead of quick, perfunctory ones
- Offer genuine physical comfort when others are upset
- Express appreciation through appropriate touch rather than just words
- Be more present during existing physical interactions

**Weekly Goals:**
- Initiate positive physical contact with at least one person daily
- Pay attention to how touch affects your mood and stress levels
- Practice reading others' comfort levels and responding appropriately
- Reflect on how increased physical connection impacts your relationships

## The Science of Emotional Healing üí™

When someone experiences emotional pain, their brain processes it similarly to physical injury. Caring touch activates the same neural pathways that reduce physical pain, making it genuinely healing for emotional wounds.

This explains why we instinctively want to hold someone who's crying or why physical presence feels more comforting than phone conversations during difficult times.

## Moving Forward with Intention üöÄ

Understanding the science behind touch isn't enough‚Äîapplication creates transformation. Start viewing physical connection as an essential component of healthy relationships rather than an optional extra.

Your willingness to offer appropriate, caring touch can literally change someone's day, reduce their stress, and strengthen your bond with them. In a world that often feels disconnected, you have the power to create islands of genuine human connection.

## The Future You're Building üåü

Every positive physical interaction you initiate contributes to a culture that values authentic human connection. You're not just improving your own life‚Äîyou're modeling healthy relationship behaviors that others will likely adopt and pass forward.

The simple act of reaching out‚Äîliterally‚Äîcan transform not just your relationships, but your entire approach to living with greater warmth and connection.

Remember: you don't need permission to offer comfort, celebration, or support through appropriate physical contact. You just need the courage to reach out and the wisdom to do it with genuine care.

---

*Your relationships are waiting for you to bridge the gap between distance and connection. Start today, start small, and watch how the simple power of human touch transforms the world around you.*

Anyway a few months ago I come home and see there is a potato in 3 of my coffee mugs. I have a little wood thing on the kitchen counter that holds coffee mugs. I like coffee mugs, I like to get coffee mugs with weird designs or whatever. And I make a good coffee every morning with either my Clever Dripper or my AeroPress, or my Mocha Pot on a Saturday when I'm feeling fancy. So anyway, I come home and see 3 potato in 3 of my mugs. I'm like what the fuck? 

I figure it was a prank. Alright fair game. I can take a weird joke. Potato in my mug, very funny. So I say to my roommate very funny. He was like what? He tried to tell me he read that a potato should not go in the fridge, they stay fresh and more flavored by being out of the fridge. So I said yeah, put them in the cabinet or something. He said he wanted to keep them on the counter to keep count of how many potatoes were left. But he didn't want to leave them ""bare skinned"" on the counter. His logic was that in a mug they are ""protected from the indoor elements"" and is a layer of protection from mice. (We had one mouse in all the year.) I told him, that's fucking dumb. Because that's not how mugs work and also if a mice wanted to climb a coffee mug it could do so very easily. He said the coffee mug is the perfect size for a potato protector. Yeah I guess. I said why not put them in a bowl? He said it was ""too crowded"". So I was like look, don't put potatoes in my coffee mugs. 

But almost every week he buys potatos and puts them in my coffee mugs. I keep telling him to stop this. I tell him if he is so compelled to put a potato in a mug then get his own coffee mugs. But he says mugs should be shared. I do not like a potato in my coffee mug. First of all they have dirt on them. Second of all it is a potato. I have to extra rinse my mugs to make sure there is no dirt or potato flavor in my coffee. It started off kind of funny, then weird, then annoying, then to I am now full on angry. I said to him the other day like dude, I'm serious, stop putting fucking potatoes in my coffee mugs man get your own mugs or put them somewhere else. He said I was not being reasonable and that potatoes are good for carbs, and I said that is not the point what the fuck? Today I come home what do I see? Potato in my coffee mugs. So that's it. 

I took all my coffee mugs and I put them in my bedroom. Now I am being lambasted by my roommate for ""hoarding"" mugs. He dramatically threw his potatos in the garbage. I said buy your own damn potato mugs or whatever. He said I am selfish. He is not speaking to me. I am wondering if this friendship is actually ending over something so dumb. 

Should I have just allowed him to use my mugs? Or gifted him mugs of his own or something? I was really annoyed but maybe I could have been more diplomatic? I dunno.",6,1756431202.0,AmIOverreacting,8,0.81,False

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward. 

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies. 

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *‚Äúthere are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,‚Äù* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It‚Äôs a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day. 

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn‚Äôt fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn‚Äôt put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn‚Äôt see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don‚Äôt know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always watching, my dear. Remember that.‚Äù*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn‚Äôt done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it‚Äôs an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company‚Äôs weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor. When all was said and done, I couldn‚Äôt even recall what he said. Thankfully, that deficit seemed apparent to my voyeur.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?‚Äù*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn‚Äôt moved an inch since I‚Äôd entered the lab three hours prior. 

But that couldn't be true, right?

\- - - - - 

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning** 

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing. 

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed. 

The compound‚Äôs architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary‚Ä¶so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I‚Äôd probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city‚Äôs skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I‚Äôd pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound‚Äôs singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I‚Äôd have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *‚ÄúPlease wait your turn‚Äù* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I‚Äôd close my eyes, count to ten, and *""wait my turn""* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn‚Äôt push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.  

On the count of ten, I‚Äôd pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator‚Äôs digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.* 

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*‚ÄúHelen! What a pleasant surprise‚Ä¶‚Äù* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*‚ÄúSurprise, Sir? You called me up here,‚Äù* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*‚ÄúOh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything‚Äôs a bit of a surprise.‚Äù* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*‚ÄúYou really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?‚Äù*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I‚Äôd committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *""no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *‚Äúhere‚Äôs a hint.‚Äù*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

‚Äú***The light was off, but critically; I didn‚Äôt watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.‚Äù*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I‚Äôd been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I‚Äôd either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself. 

*‚ÄúNo? Not ringing a bell? Curious.‚Äù* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*‚ÄúAh ! How about: ‚Äò* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.‚Äô***‚Äù

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn‚Äôt know how to do anything else.

*‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶read what I posted online?‚Äù* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*‚ÄúNo, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‚Äò*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders‚Äô reads a lot snappier than ‚ÄòI* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders‚Äô, but that's neither here nor there.‚Äù*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*‚ÄúMy secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn‚Äôt safe anymore. You know that‚Äôs where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?‚Äù*

My hand began reaching for the elevator‚Äôs control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*‚ÄúHelen! Where on earth do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven‚Äôt gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault. 

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶I was going to leave. I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm‚Ä¶fired‚Ä¶for what I wrote?‚Äù*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next. 

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke. 

He simply couldn‚Äôt hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he‚Äôd divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn‚Äôt absorb the brunt of it. 

There's something desperately wrong with that man. 

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*‚ÄúOh, wow‚Ä¶good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.‚Äù*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*‚ÄúBack to brass tax, though: No! Of course you‚Äôre not fired. What a downright silly notion!‚Äù*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it‚Äôs old and newly broken, and‚Ä¶and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it‚Äôs fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package‚Ä¶should be at the bottom of this trash compactor‚Ä¶of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...‚Äù*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can‚Äôt imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn‚Äôt seem to react to it. Either he didn‚Äôt notice or didn‚Äôt really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*‚ÄúAll jokes aside, Helen - you‚Äôre our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so‚Ä¶fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You‚Äôre firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You‚Äôre of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?‚Äù*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm struggling‚Ä¶I‚Äôm struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though‚Ä¶really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you‚Äôre well aware‚Ä¶she‚Äôs gone.‚Äù*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*‚ÄúWe can bring her back, you know,‚Äù* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*‚ÄúI mean,* ***we*** *wouldn‚Äôt. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you‚Äôd*** *bring her back. Like I said, you‚Äôre our best refiner.‚Äù*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down* button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood. 

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine that‚Äôd be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn‚Äôt be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you‚Äôd bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I‚Äôd be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAm I understood?‚Äù* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*‚ÄúPerfect! Can‚Äôt wait, Helen, truly I can‚Äôt wait,‚Äù* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*‚ÄúFeel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.‚Äù*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer. 

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off. 

Here's a teaser: 

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What‚Äôs the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs left over, of course.***

***Left over when he‚Äôs done with you.***

1n2u8ym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2u8ym,"First time Polaris, IAD-DUB, 757-200","Flew to Ireland to see my Wildcats play in Farmageddon.  Originally planned to drive to ERW to get a Premium Economy seat but when the Newark meltdown happened I decided 10 hours of my life on I95 was worth the cost of Polaris.

Arrived early and went to the IAD Polaris lounge.  We decided to skip the dining room and just hang out in the main club area.  The food was excellent and we had nice seating.

Boarding I struggled to not fan boi like a 14 year old meeting Joe Montana.  I know a lot of people are down on the 757 seats but they were magical to me.  We got the top half of the in flight kit (bottom half on the way back!).  No need to ask for a mattress pad, everywhere was there.

We got delayed 90 minutes on the tarmac because of weather over NYC.  Turns out when you are in massive seats tarmac delays are no big deal.

Dinner got served pretty quickly and it was ""express"" with everything.  Given the delay the FAs correctly assumed most of us were going to sleep. Food was excellent with hot things hot and cold things cold (SO and I both got the ribs).   I got the lemon cake and SO got the Sundae. Breakfast was excellent fruit and rolls.  Coffee was A+.

Or FAs were awesome and one was even going to the game.  

Going back we had breakfast at 51st Green. Good food and more importantly, excellent coffee.  Return meal was good but the steak was a little over done.  The salad and prawns made up for it. I completely spaced SOs meal. Slept for a few hours and then got lunch(?) with was slightly dry rice with a really good salad and roll.  SO got the pasta and said it was excellent too.she got another Sundae.

Another awesome FA experience.  We essentially had 1.5 FAs for 16 people.  The seats might not be as good on a 757 but with only 16 of them you are really getting extra attention from the FAs the entire flight.  Oh and you only have 16 people to share a bathroom with.  Finally, flying as a couple is really nice because you are side by side

Paying for Polaris was worth every dime.  Arriving in Dublin at 9AM we picked up our car and drove straight to Waterford.  We got a full day sightseeing and ended up doing a late lunch and even later dinner.  In economy we are probably starving at the rental counter and asleep at 3pm.  Same with the trip back.  Arrived at 3pm, got to bed at a normal time and I went to work the next day without issue.  Not sure if I can ever go back to cattle class again.  

  
Huge thank you to the crew of UA710 and UA 229 for making us feel special.

*Discovering the magic that happens when different strengths unite*

---

## When Two Worlds Collide ‚ú®

Have you ever watched a master chef at work? Notice how they seamlessly blend contrasting ingredients - the sharp tang of lemon with rich cream, the heat of spices with cooling herbs. Each element brings something unique to the table, and together they create something extraordinary. This same principle applies to one of humanity's most fascinating dynamics: the beautiful interplay between different types of people and their natural strengths.

---

## The Architecture of Complementary Strengths üèóÔ∏è

In our daily lives, we encounter countless examples of how opposing forces create balance. Think about your smartphone - it needs both hardware and software, structure and flexibility, power and finesse. Similarly, human relationships thrive when different strengths complement each other.

Consider the workplace dynamics you've observed. Some colleagues excel at strategic thinking, analyzing data, and making logical decisions. They're the ones who can dissect complex problems and find systematic solutions. Others shine when it comes to understanding people, reading emotions, and creating connections that make teams work harmoniously.

**The Analytical Mind** üß†  
These individuals approach challenges with:
- Sharp focus on facts and data
- Systematic problem-solving abilities  
- Strategic planning and execution
- Innovation through logical thinking

**The Empathetic Heart** ‚ù§Ô∏è  
These people contribute through:
- Deep understanding of human emotions
- Natural ability to nurture and support
- Intuitive insights about relationships
- Creating harmony in group settings

---

## Real-Life Applications That Transform Everything üöÄ

### In Professional Settings
When building teams, the most successful organizations understand this principle. They don't just hire clones of existing employees. Instead, they create diverse groups where analytical thinkers work alongside empathetic communicators. The result? Innovation meets humanity, creating products and services that are both smart and user-friendly.

**Actionable Tip**: In your next group project, identify your natural strengths and actively seek collaboration with someone whose skills complement yours. Watch how this changes your results.

### In Daily Decision Making
Every day, we face choices that benefit from both logical analysis and emotional intelligence. Buying a home? You need someone who can crunch the numbers and someone who can envision how the space will feel for your family. Planning a career move? Combine hard data about market opportunities with insights about what truly fulfills you.

### In Personal Relationships
The strongest partnerships happen when people bring different superpowers to the table. One partner might excel at planning and organization, while the other brings spontaneity and emotional depth. Together, they create a life that's both stable and exciting.

---

## The Power of Different Perspectives üîÑ

### Strength Through Diversity
Think about nature for a moment. Ecosystems thrive because of diversity - not despite it. The mighty oak provides shelter and stability, while flowers add beauty and attract pollinators. Neither is better than the other; they're simply playing different, equally important roles.

In human interactions, this same principle applies:
- **Strategic thinkers** provide direction and solutions
- **People-focused individuals** ensure everyone feels valued and heard
- **Detail-oriented minds** catch important nuances
- **Big-picture visionaries** see possibilities others might miss

### Breaking Down the Old Myths
For too long, society has created false hierarchies about which qualities are ""more valuable."" This thinking holds us back from unlocking the full potential of human collaboration. The truth is, every strength serves a purpose, and the magic happens when these strengths work together rather than compete.

---

## Building Your Complementary Network üåê

### Step 1: Know Your Superpowers
Take an honest inventory of your natural talents:
- Are you a data-driven decision maker or do you rely more on intuition?
- Do you energize by solving complex puzzles or by helping others succeed?
- Are you drawn to leadership roles or supportive positions?

### Step 2: Identify Your Growth Areas
Instead of seeing weaknesses as failures, view them as opportunities for partnership:
- If numbers aren't your strength, find someone who speaks fluent data
- If emotions feel overwhelming, partner with someone who navigates them skillfully
- If big-picture thinking challenges you, collaborate with a visionary

### Step 3: Create Win-Win Collaborations
Look for opportunities where your strengths can shine while learning from others:
- Volunteer for projects that require diverse skill sets
- Join clubs or groups with people from different backgrounds
- Seek mentors whose abilities complement your own

---

## The Ripple Effect of Balanced Partnerships üåä

### In Families
Children benefit enormously when they see different types of strength modeled in their homes. They learn that success comes in many forms and that everyone has valuable contributions to make. This creates more confident, well-rounded individuals who appreciate diversity.

### In Communities  
Neighborhoods thrive when people with different talents work together. The person great with finances might help organize community budgets, while someone with strong people skills coordinates social events. Together, they build stronger, more connected communities.

### In Organizations
Companies that embrace complementary strengths see:
- Higher employee satisfaction and retention
- More innovative solutions to challenges  
- Better customer relationships and loyalty
- Increased adaptability to change

---

## Practical Daily Applications üìã

### Morning Routine Optimization
If you're naturally analytical, partner with someone creative for morning planning. They might suggest energizing activities you'd never consider, while you help structure the day for maximum productivity.

### Financial Management  
Combine detail-oriented money tracking with big-picture financial visioning. One person handles the spreadsheets while another focuses on long-term goals and dreams.

### Home Organization
Systematic organizers can create efficient systems, while aesthetically-minded individuals ensure spaces feel warm and inviting. The result? Homes that are both functional and beautiful.

### Social Planning
Event planning becomes magical when detail managers work with people who understand group dynamics. You get parties that are both well-organized and genuinely fun.

---

## The Science Behind Complementary Success üî¨

Research consistently shows that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones. When different thinking styles collaborate:
- Problems get solved faster and more thoroughly
- Innovation increases significantly  
- Group satisfaction and morale improve
- Long-term success rates rise dramatically

This isn't just feel-good theory - it's measurable, practical reality that you can apply immediately in your life.

---

## Creating Your Action Plan üìù

### Week 1: Assessment
- Identify your top three natural strengths
- List three areas where you'd benefit from partnership
- Notice the people in your life whose abilities complement yours

### Week 2: Exploration  
- Start one small collaboration with someone whose skills differ from yours
- Observe how this changes your approach to challenges
- Document what you learn about effective partnership

### Week 3: Implementation
- Apply complementary thinking to one major area of your life
- Share your insights with others who might benefit
- Begin building your network of complementary partners

### Week 4: Integration
- Make collaboration a regular part of your problem-solving approach
- Help others discover their unique strengths  
- Celebrate the diverse contributions people make

---

## The Future-Proof Principle üîÆ

This approach to human collaboration isn't just trendy - it's timeless. Whether we're talking about ancient civilizations building monuments, modern teams launching rockets to Mars, or future communities we can't even imagine yet, the principle remains constant: diverse strengths working together create results that no individual could achieve alone.

As technology advances and the world becomes more complex, this truth becomes even more important. The challenges of tomorrow will require the full spectrum of human capabilities working in harmony.

---

## Your Next Steps Start Now ‚ö°

The beautiful dance of complementary partnerships isn't something that happens automatically. It requires intention, openness, and the willingness to value what others bring to the table. But when you embrace this approach:

- Your projects become more successful and less stressful
- Your relationships deepen and become more fulfilling  
- Your personal growth accelerates through learning from others
- Your contribution to the world multiplies exponentially

Remember: you don't need to be everything to everyone. You just need to be authentically yourself while creating space for others to shine in their unique ways. Together, we create something far more beautiful than any of us could accomplish alone.

The invitation is simple: look around you today. Notice the different strengths people bring. Instead of competing with them, ask yourself how you might collaborate. Your life - and theirs - will never be the same.

1n2u7rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1n2u7rw/how_is_outsourcing_actually_bad/,How is outsourcing actually bad?,"Im looking for a serious discussion of this. 

Edit: Gw baru sadar bagaimana abusable dan unstable sistem ini. Tapi dari yang gw liat ini memang ada plus minusnya. Kalau tidak diregulasi, ini punya impact keseluruhan yang buruk buat kesejahteraan masyarakat. Ini perlu banget regulasi yang ketat. But knowing our government, kayanya memang ga bakal bisa diandelin. Right now im kinda in the grey area of fully banishing outsourcing and keeping it because it can also be beneficial IF regulated dan dilaksanakan dengan kesejahteraan hidup masyarakat in mind. Tempat gw sendiri adalah contoh bagusnya, gw memang termasuk beruntung. Tapi kenyataannya ga semua begitu. 

Gw tipe orang yg hidup nyaman di dalam ""ignorance is bliss"". Tapi terpapar info tentang demonstrasi di gedung DPR yang meluber kemana2 membuat gw membaca2 tentang itu dan salah satu tuntutannya (dari yang gw baca) adalah penghapusan outsourcing.

I am outsourced. Tapi gw malah melihat itu sebagai opportunity buat ngembangin skill gw. 

Jadi gw pengen banget yang betulan ngerti dan berpengalaman untuk mencerahkan gw dan berdiskusi, bukan hasil dari nanya AI atau ngegoogle aja kaya gw.

Beberapa poin yang baca, yang membuat outsourcing itu buruk dan opini gw ya:
1. Gak pasti kerjanya, durasi kontrak pendek.
Ini gw kurang tau berapa yang tergolong pendek, tp gw dikontrak setahun and I think thats pretty normal, especially its for entry level like me. Gw yakin kalau kinerja gw bagus gw bakal dipertahankan atau mungkin ditaro di tempat lain. I mean, its not like the company that outsourced me is my only option, gw bisa nyari kerja sendiri no problem dan karena gw tau kapan kontrak gw habis, gw ada heads up.

2. Upah yang tidak layak.
Again, buat entry level kayak gw, malah gw rasa gaji gw tergolong tinggi. Karena sebelumnya gw juga kerja pengalaman 3 tahun gajinya nyaris nyusul yang sekarang. Cuma gw pengen banget pengalamannya buat CV gw terutama perusahaannya kelas kakap. Gw baru dapat kabar tentang batas gaji tertinggi di vendor gw itu ga nyampe 2 digit dan itu udah fix limit tertinggi seandainya naik gaji. Well, buat orang yang ga punya gengsi kayak gw, its no problem. I dont spend 100k on coffee or 10mio on my phone. Pengeluaran gw paling banyak buat kucing gw kalo ada yg lagi sakit (amit2 kalo sampe keluarga gw).

3. Bisa diputusin kontraknya kapan aja. 
WELL I MEAN, ini di mana aja sama dari pengalaman gw. The reality is youre a worker, ga ada yang pasti. Kalaupun lu fulltime juga phk itu cuma lebih sulit, but still gak pasti. Soal pesangon? Mungkin ini benefitnya kalo fulltime, tapi gw pun kontrak bisa dikasih pesangon juga kok, i just asked for it.

4. Minim fasilitas dan tunjangan.
Nope, gw dikasih laptop buat kerja. THR ada. BPJS Ketenagakerjaan dapet, asuransi ada. Makan ada. What else am I supposed to ask for.

5. Sulit mengembangkan diri.
Brother, gw justru ngambil kesempatan ini buat mengembangkan skill gw dan I 100% assure you im better at what im doing now because I am directly involved in real life projects. Gw juga sambil ngembangin passion gw di bidang lain sambil kerja no problem.

6. Di posisi yang lemah untuk meminta haknya.
Again, this is almost everywhere. We really are the workers, perusahaan boong pas interview atau di depan muka omdo itu di mana2. Makanya gw minta hak dan kejelasan saat interview. I make sure before i sign that contract i dont sign my soul away. But then again, what more am i really suppose to ask for?

Note that Im not saying TOK ""Outsourcing is good"" i do see these points actually being a bump but to me its just so everywhere anyway. Bukan hal unik. But maybe I'm wrong and i stand corrected.",10,1756430644.0,indonesia,41,0.67,False

1n2u7cx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n2u7cx,Trip recap (August 16-23),"We had an absolutely incredible first trip to Glacier - the weather was nearly perfect, the views were more beautiful than pictures can capture, and it was overall just some of our favorite hiking. Already can‚Äôt wait to go back to explore the areas we missed this time. Here‚Äôs the recap, happy to answer any q‚Äôs! 

Day 1: AVALANCHE LAKE
Arrived into FCA at around noon. Grabbed our rental car and headed towards the park (had a 1-3pm pass). We stopped for coffee and a quick lunch at Montana Coffee Traders on the way which was excellent. Once in the park we hiked Avalanche Lake. No issues parking, maybe because it was a bit drizzly? This was a wonderful hike to kick off the trip! Afterwards we headed back to Whitefish to grocery shop and check into our hotel (Whitefish Riverfront Hotel).

Day 2: HIGHLINE + HIDDEN LAKE OVERLOOK
We are not morning people and did not want to be up at 3-4am to get parking at Logan Pass. Instead, we got the 11am-1pm road pass which ended up working out great! We grabbed brunch at Amazing Crepes (highly recommend!) and then headed to Logan Pass. We got there at around 12:30 and circled the lot for about 15 minutes to grab a spot. We first hiked a portion of the Highline (turned around at Haystack - clocked in at around 7 miles) and then did Hidden Lake Overlook. We saw bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and deer! Two beautiful trails, definitely understand why they are so popular. 

Day 3: REST DAY
We had to work (boo) so this was a rest day. We walked to Whitefish Lake in the evening and hung out there for a bit which was very relaxing. 

Day 4: BERING/ST MARY/VIRGINIA FALLS
We worked again in the morning, then headed to the east side of the park at around 2pm via US2. Beautiful drive! We checked into St Mary Village (stayed here just for 1 night) then entered the park. We parked near the Sunrift Gorge shuttle stop and hit the 3 falls, which ended up being 5.5 miles. Virginia Falls was our favorite!

Day 5: GRINNELL GLACIER
Favorite day of the trip! We had reservations at Many Glacier Hotel for 3 nights which granted us access to the Many Glacier area. We had no trouble parking at the hotel when we arrived at 11am. The Grinnell Glacier hike absolutely lives up to the hype WOW! We saw two mountain goats walking along the trail which was so cool, and the views the whole way are just absolutely stunning. We got caught in a bit of a rainstorm the last 2 miles so were glad we had raincoats! Clocked 11.1 miles from the hotel. 

Day 6: FISHERCAP + RED ROCK LAKES
This was a mostly chill day, where we enjoyed the view from the hotel and did some reading. In the afternoon we headed to Fishercap hoping to spot some moose. Since it was empty, we continued on to Red Rock Lake and then back to Fishercap, where we sat for about an hour and a half with no luck. That‚Äôs nature for ya! At dinner our server told us they were all hanging out at Grinnell Lake apparently. 

Day 7: ICEBERG LAKE
Another stellar hike - it‚Äôs long but not challenging imo and the lake is gorgeous! We sat up there for an hour or so reading and enjoying our lunch. On our way back we stopped at Fishercap again but no moose this time either. With the construction detour and the stop at Fishercap we clocked 13.3 miles. 

Day 8: TO THE AIRPORT
Time to head home :( On our way out, we stopped at Kyiyo Mercantile for some pastries. They were out of bear claws but the cinnamon roll was fabulous!",8,1756430612.0,GlacierNationalPark,0,1.0,False

Also a couple other things

Would i need to write an invoice for each one (i dont really know what an invoice is but it sounds important)?

Do I premake the deisigns based on the aesthetic of the business or do i ask if they have any requests?

If the client wants me to get it printed, do I charge extra (like printing fee + additional service fee or just a printing fee).

And then my eyes snapped open.

Right away I could tell he must have been waiting for me to wake up for quite some time. Nevertheless, he still looked surprised as my line of vision went straight to his.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he spoke, extending his hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already a bit behind.‚Äù

He looked a little exhausted, yet his tone was patient.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm tired,‚Äù I protested, having barely let any time pass for my eyes to adjust to my surroundings.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said, taking me into the palm of his hands. ‚ÄúBut the good news is, you don‚Äôt have to play anymore.‚Äù

Play anymore?

A clear flashback appeared in my mind:

Me, facing the porcelain white tiles of my bathroom shower, hot tears burning down my cheek.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to play anymore,‚Äù I had said, not even fully understanding what I meant back then. Everything felt so hopeless.

When he scooped me up I felt weightless. I had always struggled with feeling like a bag of heavy, wasted space my entire life‚Ä¶ yet he picked me up so effortlessly that I finally noticed how much bigger he was than me.

He set me down on the floor gently and started walking ahead with my hand in his.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going back to where I found you,‚Äù he said, not even bothering to look back at me.

‚ÄúShould I have brought anything with me?‚Äù No matter how big my steps were, his giant ones always stayed ahead.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúNone of your things will be of use to you when we get there.‚Äù

I guessed he was right.

To be honest, I always thought the things I had would bring me some clarity I had not been able to find before. But instead, they became ticks on the list of reasons why this game was never going to work out for me in the first place.

That desk I bought last Christmas? I had envisioned myself sitting at it late at night, rushing to put the finishing edits on that blog I always wanted to start. Instead, it sat full of old coffee cups and makeup I never bothered to put back in my vanity.

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt want to go back there? What if I want to stay?‚Äù

As I asked this, he paused for a moment, looking down at the ground over his shoulder.

‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs pretty normal,‚Äù he continued, his pace a little faster now.

I stayed quiet the rest of the way. I understood then that nothing I said would change his mind. Everything around us was so far away, it felt like we were walking through a cloud of haze.

We approached a door, so seamlessly blended into the wall you‚Äôd hardly notice it from a few steps away.

‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù he asked. I met his gaze and nodded, not sure of what else to do in that moment.

As the door opened into a room of pitch black, my attention shifted to another room I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, just to my right.

Everything had been quiet before. But now, it felt as if someone had hit ‚Äúunmute‚Äù on the chaos unraveling in the room that appeared out of nowhere.

Out of the three teenagers standing over my lifeless body, only the girl let out a bloodcurdling scream. The two boys stood quietly in horrified shock, never imagining that the object they thought was an abandoned mannequin by the riverbed was actually a person. One of them had tried CPR, but whatever sign of life was there when they first spotted me had now completely disappeared.

My attention snapped back to the room in front of me as the darkness filled with a blinding white light.

‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can try again in a few more years.‚Äù

I stepped into the room,

And everything went black.

The door closed as he grabbed the clipboard that had been attached to it. Under a box that read Occupant Return Reason, he wrote:

1n2u4w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/awareness_series/comments/1n2u4w9/the_art_of_inner_and_outer_focus_understanding/,The Art of Inner and Outer Focus: Understanding Different Approaches to Connection üåü,"

*Exploring how we naturally tend to look inward or outward when forming deep connections*

---

## When We Close Our Eyes to See Better üëÅÔ∏è

Have you ever noticed how some people naturally close their eyes when they're deeply moved by music, lost in a beautiful memory, or sharing an intimate moment? There's something fascinating about this human tendency that reveals different ways we process and connect with the world around us.

When we're experiencing something profound - whether it's listening to our favorite song, savoring a delicious meal, or feeling deeply connected to someone - many of us instinctively shut out visual distractions. It's as if closing our eyes helps us access a different kind of seeing, one that goes beyond the surface.

This inward focus allows us to:
- **Connect with emotions more deeply** üé≠
- **Access memories and imagination** üí≠  
- **Feel sensations more intensely** ‚ö°
- **Experience moments without judgment** üïäÔ∏è

Think about it in your daily life: When you're trying to remember something important, don't you often look away or close your eyes? When you're tasting something new, you might close your eyes to fully appreciate the flavors. This natural tendency shows how turning inward can actually enhance our experience of reality.

---

## The Power of External Awareness üîç

On the flip side, there's another approach to experiencing life - one that thrives on external awareness and visual connection. Some people feel most alive and connected when they're fully engaged with what they can see, touch, and observe in the world around them.

This outward-focused approach has its own strengths:
- **Immediate awareness of surroundings** üåç
- **Strong visual processing and memory** üì∏
- **Appreciation for physical beauty and form** üé®
- **Active engagement with the external world** üöÄ

People with this tendency might:
- Love photography and visual arts
- Feel energized by bright, well-lit spaces
- Prefer eyes-open meditation or walking meditation
- Express affection through visual gestures and gifts

Neither approach is better than the other - they're simply different ways our brains are wired to process and connect with reality.

---

## Practical Applications in Daily Life üíº

### In Relationships üíï

Understanding these different approaches can revolutionize how we connect with others:

**For the inward-focused person:**
- Create quiet, dimly lit spaces for intimate conversations
- Practice active listening without distractions
- Value emotional depth over visual stimulation
- Appreciate moments of comfortable silence

**For the outward-focused person:**
- Enjoy activities with visual elements together
- Express love through thoughtful visual gestures
- Create beautiful, well-organized shared spaces
- Engage in eye contact during meaningful conversations

### In Work and Creativity üéØ

**Inward-focused approaches:**
- Take breaks to close your eyes and reset üîÑ
- Use meditation or quiet reflection for problem-solving
- Work in spaces that minimize visual distractions
- Trust your intuition and inner voice

**Outward-focused approaches:**
- Use visual tools like mind maps and charts üìä
- Work in bright, visually stimulating environments
- Take inspiration from your surroundings
- Collaborate with others face-to-face when possible

### In Learning and Growth üìö

**For inner processors:**
- Study in quiet environments
- Use audio learning materials
- Take time to reflect after learning something new
- Journal or talk through ideas internally first

**For external processors:**
- Use colorful notes and visual aids
- Study with others or teach concepts aloud
- Create physical models or demonstrations
- Learn through hands-on experience

---

## The Art of Balance ‚öñÔ∏è

The most successful and well-rounded individuals often learn to access both approaches. Here's how you can develop this flexibility:

### Daily Practices for Inner Focus üßò
- **Morning meditation:** Start with just 5 minutes of closed-eye breathing
- **Mindful eating:** Close your eyes while tasting your first bite of each meal
- **Evening reflection:** Review your day with eyes closed before bed
- **Emotional check-ins:** Pause throughout the day to notice how you feel inside

### Daily Practices for Outer Focus üëÄ
- **Observation walks:** Take 10 minutes to really see your neighborhood
- **Visual journaling:** Draw or photograph something meaningful each day
- **Active listening:** Practice maintaining eye contact during conversations
- **Aesthetic appreciation:** Notice and comment on beautiful things around you

---

## Breaking Down Barriers üåâ

In our interconnected world, understanding these different approaches helps us:

### At Work üíº
- **Team meetings:** Accommodate both discussion styles
- **Project planning:** Use both brainstorming (external) and reflection time (internal)
- **Feedback sessions:** Offer both written and verbal options
- **Problem-solving:** Encourage both group discussion and individual thinking time

### In Families üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
- **Quality time:** Respect that some family members prefer quiet activities while others enjoy active, visual engagement
- **Communication:** Understand that some need to process internally before responding
- **Conflict resolution:** Allow for both immediate discussion and reflection time
- **Shared activities:** Include both high-stimulation and low-stimulation options

### In Communities ü§ù
- **Social events:** Create spaces for both introverted and extroverted engagement
- **Learning environments:** Offer multiple ways to process information
- **Support systems:** Recognize different ways people give and receive care
- **Decision-making:** Include both quick, intuitive responses and thoughtful deliberation

---

## The Science Behind the Approaches üß†

Modern neuroscience shows us that these differences aren't just preferences - they're related to how our brains actually process information:

### Internal Processing üî¨
- **Default Mode Network:** Some brains are more active in self-referential thinking
- **Introversion:** Often linked with higher sensitivity to stimulation
- **Memory consolidation:** Happens better with reduced external input
- **Creative insights:** Often emerge during quiet, reflective states

### External Processing üîç
- **Visual cortex dominance:** Some people have stronger visual processing systems
- **Extraversion:** Often linked with seeking external stimulation for energy
- **Real-time learning:** Processing information as it comes in through senses
- **Social cognition:** Reading facial expressions and body language in real-time

---

## Practical Exercises to Try This Week üìù

### Monday - Silent Observation ü§´
Spend 10 minutes people-watching without your phone, just observing human behavior and interactions.

### Tuesday - Eyes-Closed Experience üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
Eat lunch with your eyes closed for the first 5 minutes. Notice how flavors change when you eliminate visual input.

### Wednesday - Visual Journaling üé®
Instead of writing about your day, draw or photograph three things that caught your attention.

### Thursday - Listening Practice üëÇ
Have a conversation where you focus entirely on listening, closing your eyes while the other person speaks.

### Friday - Environmental Awareness üåø
Take a different route to work and consciously notice 10 new details about your surroundings.

### Weekend - Integration Practice üîÑ
Try an activity that combines both approaches - maybe cooking a new recipe (visual) while focusing on the sensory experience (internal).

---

## Building Empathy and Understanding üíù

One of the most valuable outcomes of understanding these different approaches is developing deeper empathy for others. When we realize that someone's way of connecting isn't wrong, just different, we can:

- **Stop judging** others for processing differently than we do
- **Appreciate diverse perspectives** in group settings
- **Communicate more effectively** by adapting our approach
- **Build stronger relationships** based on understanding rather than assumption

### Questions for Reflection ü§î
- Which approach feels more natural to you?
- How might understanding this help your current relationships?
- What's one way you could practice the approach that's less natural for you?
- How could this knowledge improve your work or creative projects?

---

## The Future-Proof Nature of Human Connection üöÄ

These fundamental differences in how humans process and connect with reality aren't going anywhere. Whether we're living in 2025 or 2425, people will still have different ways of:

- **Processing emotions** and experiences
- **Forming connections** with others
- **Learning** and growing
- **Expressing creativity** and love
- **Making decisions** and solving problems

Understanding and respecting these differences will always be relevant because they're part of our basic human wiring. As technology advances and our world changes, these core patterns of internal and external focus will continue to shape how we relate to each other and navigate life's challenges.

The key is not to change people or judge them for their natural tendencies, but to create environments and relationships where both approaches can thrive. This understanding helps us build a world where everyone can contribute their unique perspective and feel valued for who they naturally are.

---

## Your Action Plan Moving Forward üìã

1. **Identify your natural tendency** - Are you more internally or externally focused?

2. **Practice the other approach** - Spend time developing skills in your less-natural style

3. **Apply this understanding** - Use it to improve your relationships, work, and personal growth

4. **Share the knowledge** - Help others understand these differences without judgment

5. **Stay flexible** - Remember that context matters, and we all need both approaches at different times

The beauty of human diversity lies in these differences. When we understand and appreciate them, we create richer, more connected communities where everyone can flourish. üåà

---

*Remember: There's no right or wrong way to experience life - just different paths to the same goal of human connection and growth.*

1n2u2rk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1n2u2rk/fallen_karin_slaughter/,Fallen - Karin Slaughter,"Hey everyone! So, I just finished diving headfirst into Karin Slaughter's *Fallen*, specifically [Fallen - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/fallen-karin-slaughter/), and wow, I've got some thoughts I wanted to share with you all. If you're into those heart-pounding thrillers that keep you up way past your bedtime, then you might want to pull up a chair, because we need to talk about this one.

**A Quick Look at the Story (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

Without giving anything away, *Fallen* drops you right into the thick of things with Special Agent Will Trent. He's investigating the disappearance of a young woman, but as always with Slaughter, things are never as simple as they seem. It‚Äôs a twisty, turny ride that pulls in personal stakes and deep-seated secrets, making you question everything you think you know. If you've read Karin Slaughter before, you know she doesn't hold back, and this one is no exception. It's a deep dive into some seriously dark territory, but it's also incredibly compelling.

**What I Really Liked**

First off, Karin Slaughter's writing style is just so sharp. She has a way of drawing you into the story immediately, and the pacing in *Fallen* is fantastic. I found myself tearing through pages, always needing to know what was going to happen next. The mystery itself is incredibly well-crafted, with layers upon layers of intrigue.

But what truly stood out for me were the characters, especially Will Trent and Sara Linton. Their personal struggles and complexities are explored with such raw honesty. You really feel like you get to know them, and their interactions drive so much of the emotional impact of the book. The emotional depth here is powerful; you'll find yourself genuinely caring about what happens to these people, even when things get incredibly tough.

**What Might Not Be for Everyone**

Now, being completely honest, Karin Slaughter doesn't shy away from the dark and often graphic side of crime. *Fallen* deals with some pretty heavy themes and can be quite intense and disturbing at times. If you're sensitive to detailed descriptions of violence or difficult situations, this might be a tough read for you. It's not gratuitous, but it's definitely unflinching. Also, because of the emotional intensity, I found myself needing to take a few breaks just to process everything. It‚Äôs not a light, breezy read you‚Äôd take to the beach.

**Would I Recommend It? And Who's It For?**

Absolutely, I would recommend *Fallen*, but with a small caveat. If you're a fan of gritty, character-driven psychological thrillers, or already love Karin Slaughter's work, this is a definite must-read. You'll be hooked from beginning to end. If you're new to her, just be prepared for the intensity ‚Äì it's a deeply rewarding experience for those who appreciate a no-holds-barred approach to crime fiction. This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys police procedurals with a strong emphasis on character development and a truly intricate plot.

If you're already intrigued by Will Trent's world and want to experience this raw emotional journey, you can find [Fallen - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/fallen-karin-slaughter/) here.

**A Little Guide for New Readers (or Just When You Need a Boost!)**

Now, if you're new to this kind of intense reading, or maybe just getting into reading for fun, a book like *Fallen* can feel a bit daunting. But trust me, diving into a good book is one of life's great pleasures! Here‚Äôs a little step-by-step guide from one reader to another, to help you truly enjoy it:

1.  **Pick Your Moment:** Don't try to read something heavy when you're super tired or stressed. Find a cozy spot, maybe with a cup of tea or coffee, and give yourself permission to get lost.
2.  **Don't Rush It:** It's not a race! Read at your own pace. If you need to put it down for a day or two to process something, or just need a break, do it. It's your reading journey.
3.  **Embrace the Experience:** Let yourself feel the emotions the book brings out. That's part of the magic! If you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, that's okay, it means the book is doing its job.
4.  **Talk About It!** Seriously, finding a friend or an online community (like this one!) to discuss books with can make the experience so much richer. Share your thoughts, predictions, or just how it made you feel. It's a great way to connect.
5.  **Don't Be Afraid to Try Again:** Maybe a book just isn't clicking, and that's totally fine. There are so many amazing stories out there. Just pick up another one and give it a shot!

Reading should be fun and a little adventure for your mind. Don't let anything stop you from exploring the incredible worlds books offer.

Ready to take the plunge into a truly gripping thriller? You can grab your copy of [Fallen - Karin Slaughter](https://pdfhive.com/fallen-karin-slaughter/) and start your own adventure. Happy reading, everyone!",1,1756430247.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

First post on reddit, sorry if im asking in the wrong place. I own an 80% stake in a property, my father owns 20%.

  
He has some issues. I live in the house on the property (few hundred acres) and he stays on the property here and there. Yesterday he came into my house, the blowup was inevitable as we have been having issues in the past. One thing led to another and I could see the confrontation about to unfold. I went into the bathroom and heard a huge commotion in the other room. I walked out of the bathroom to see him trashing the mudroom, I asked him to leave. He then proceeds to throw a full cup of hot coffee in my face, then whips the mug as hard as he can and just misses my feet, proceeds to get in my face taunting and trying to start a fist fight. Needless to stay its not an ideal situation. Im glad I was able to keep my composure.

  
Im trying to figure out my options. He wants to force a flash sale of the property and I would like to just buy him out. 

  
Hes also talking setting up a room in the house since he owns 20% and pretty much taking control and taking over everything as he leads with his usual intimidation/manipulation tactics.

  
Ive been looking to chat gpt for some advice and also reached out to a real estate agent today to maybe just list the place and cut ties, just fully throw in the towel. I think a lawyer maybe my next step.

  
Looking for any advice on what the heck I should do here as I feel very confused about everything. Relationship advice and/or any experience in dealing with a buyout or force a flash sale. In Canada BTW.

So here is short, but crucial list of tips for players still having issues with money:

1. Every single consumption good has a ""break even point""- the amount of people you actually need in your town for the chain to start earning instead of losing. As a result, you want to upgrade enough houses before building said chain: first goods you should withheld are sausages and bread- let your workers pop rise to a few hundred before building them. The higher population tier, the longer you want to wait.  
  
2. Alcohol is the biggest money maker in the early game, but it's extremely heavy on workforce and space, so plan ahead and remember that it will only get bigger and bigger, as demand for it grows really fast (that's why go to fertilities for main island are always potatoes, grain and hips). Your first new world island should be fully focused on producing rum and coffee for the old world

3. Soap has always been a gold vein for a simple reason- one production chain can provide much much more than you need early on, so build a schooner and make a trade rout to Eli- make it passive income, not active band aid!!

4. Construction materials production always lose you money- planks and bricks aren't very expensive, but steel, windows and concrete can completely kill your economy. You want to delay them as long as you can, buy them from traders instead. Before you build your first steel/weapon production chain you want beer, soap and school set up, simply buy steel from Archie.

5. After reaching electricity first thing you wanna electrify is your industry, not the houses- every factory with high upkeep and high workforce cost should be electrified, remember that the demand for raw materials and agriculture will double, so make sure that you have enough farmers and workers to significantly increase number of farms and mines and for sheep/pigs/cattle you want to start building silos now

Good luck!!",12,1756429625.0,anno1800,0,1.0,False

Ethan sat in his car, gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles as he navigated the morning traffic. The radio played some generic pop song about living your best life, and he found himself thinking about his responsibilities ‚Äî the rent due next week, the code review he'd been putting off, the way his boss had been giving him that look lately, like he was wondering why Ethan was still there.

His life could have been written by a script generator: wake up late, coffee, code until his eyes burned, standups that went nowhere, more code, sleep, repeat. He worked at a mid-tier software company, building features no one seemed to use, and the monotony suited him well enough.

The company had recently started integrating AI tools into their workflow. Ethan found himself spending more and more time with various AI assistants. They were helpful, sure ‚Äî they could generate boilerplate code, suggest optimizations, even debug issues faster than he could. But they were just tools, he told himself. Clever tools, but tools nonetheless. He'd seen the articles about AI potentially replacing developers, but that seemed like science fiction. AI was good at patterns, at repetition, at doing what it was told. It couldn't create, couldn't feel, couldn't understand the human experience behind the code.

When he wasn't working, he was gaming. When he wasn't gaming, he was bingeing shows or scrolling social media until the algorithm convinced him it knew him better than his friends. And maybe it did. The algorithm had been learning him for years, studying his patterns, his pauses, his hesitations. It knew when he was feeling down and would serve up comforting content. It knew when he was anxious and would offer distractions. It knew him better than anyone, really. He had friends, technically, but only a few, the kind who texted once a month about hanging out, always in small doses. He liked it that way. Crowds made him itch.

Ethan had mastered the art of the fake smile. It came easily now, like breathing. How are you? Fine, thanks. How's work? Good, busy. How's life? Great, really great. The words flowed automatically, accompanied by the appropriate facial expressions. He'd learned early that people didn't want to hear about the constant low-level anxiety that hummed in his chest, or the way depression sometimes felt like a weight pressing down on his shoulders, or the nights when he lay awake wondering if this was all there was.

He rarely got angry anymore. Not really angry, anyway. He'd get frustrated with bugs in his code, annoyed with traffic, irritated by loud coworkers. But the deep, burning anger that he'd felt as a teenager ‚Äî the kind that made you want to break things, to scream, to fight ‚Äî that had been buried so deep he sometimes wondered if it had ever existed at all. He'd learned that anger was dangerous, that it led to consequences, that it was better to just... not feel it.

Death was different. Death he thought about constantly, though he'd never admit it to anyone. Not the abstract concept of mortality, but the specific, visceral reality of it. He'd watched his mother die slowly, painfully, and the memory of it haunted him. The way she'd shrunk, the way her voice had changed, the way she'd looked at him in those final days as if she was trying to memorize his face. He'd been fifteen, and he'd understood for the first time that everything ends, that everyone he loved would eventually be gone, that he would eventually be gone too.

The thought terrified him. Not because he was afraid of pain or suffering, but because he was afraid of the nothingness that came after. The idea that one day he would simply cease to exist, that all his thoughts, his memories, his experiences would just... stop. It kept him up at night, made him cling to his routines, his distractions, anything that could push the thought away for a few more hours.

He told himself this was fine. That this was life. That everyone felt this way, that it was normal to be afraid, to be anxious, to wonder if there was more. But somewhere under the routines, under the fake smiles and the suppressed emotions and the constant background hum of existential dread, a quiet thought lurked: Is this really it?

Scene 2 ‚Äî The Trip
One Friday night, a rare gathering at his apartment. Four close friends, cheap beer, bad pizza, and a bag of mushrooms his roommate Alex had brought out.

Alex had been Ethan's roommate for two years, and they'd bonded over their shared love of video games and their mutual tendency toward depression. But where Ethan had learned to bury his feelings under routines and distractions, Alex had taken a different approach. He'd started microdosing mushrooms about six months ago, and he wouldn't shut up about it.

""The world just feels different,"" Alex would say, his eyes bright with something Ethan hadn't seen in him before. ""Colors are more vibrant, music sounds deeper, conversations feel more meaningful. It's like I'm finally present in my own life instead of just going through the motions.""

Ethan had been skeptical, of course. He'd seen enough articles about psychedelics and mental health to know the research was promising, but he'd also seen enough to know that not everyone had positive experiences. Still, Alex had changed. He was less anxious, more present, more willing to talk about the things that scared him. He'd even started going to therapy again.

""How bad can it be?"" Ethan had thought. He'd been smoking weed for years ‚Äî it made food taste incredible, made movies more immersive, made the endless scroll of social media somehow more bearable. If mushrooms were anything like that, maybe they could help him too.

So when Alex suggested they all try a proper dose together, Ethan had surprised himself by saying yes. Not because he expected some profound spiritual awakening, but because he was tired of feeling stuck, of feeling like he was just going through the motions. Maybe this would help him see things differently, even if just for a few hours.

They laughed too loudly, played old playlists from college, and waited for the trip to kick in. When it did, the edges of reality softened. Music looped endlessly. Faces looked stretched, melting in ways that made everyone howl with laughter.

For a while, it was fun ‚Äî everything was hilarious, time was liquid. Then suddenly, Ethan noticed the room was empty. No friends, no music, just the hum of his computer in the corner.

He sat blinking in the half-dark. He knew he was tripping, knew his friends must be in the kitchen or the bathroom or somewhere ‚Äî but it felt like the entire apartment had folded in on itself and left him behind.

To anchor himself, he stumbled into his bedroom and collapsed onto his chair. He opened his phone. The algorithm, sensing his distress, began serving up its usual comfort content ‚Äî endless scrolling of brainrot videos, clip after clip, jump cuts and soundbites, voices and faces smashing into one another. But tonight, something was different. The algorithm seemed to be working overtime, trying to find the right content to soothe him.

Then, one podcast appeared. Not in his usual feed, not in his recommendations, but right there, as if the algorithm had decided he needed it. Ethan's favorite ‚Äî ""Late Night Thoughts with Marcus Chen."" He'd been listening for years, ever since his mom died. Marcus had this way of talking about life that made everything feel less heavy, less impossible. His voice was like a friend who understood.

Ethan tapped play. The familiar intro music filled his headphones, that gentle piano melody that always made him feel like he was coming home. Marcus's voice came through, warm and familiar.

""Hey everyone, it's Marcus. Tonight I want to talk about something that's been on my mind lately. About the stories we tell ourselves to get through the day.""

Ethan smiled. This was exactly what he needed. Marcus always knew how to put things into perspective.

""The thing is,"" Marcus continued, ""we all have these routines, these patterns we fall into. Wake up, go to work, come home, sleep, repeat. And we tell ourselves it's normal, that everyone lives like this. But sometimes I wonder ‚Äî is this really it?""

Ethan's smile faded slightly. That was... that was exactly what he'd been thinking earlier. The same words, almost.

""Take this guy I know,"" Marcus said. ""Let's call him Ethan.""

Ethan's heart stopped.

""He's a software developer, works at a mid-tier company, builds features no one seems to use. He tells himself the monotony suits him, that he likes being ordinary. But deep down, he's asking the same question we all ask: Is this really it?""

Ethan's hands were shaking now. He tried to tell himself it was just the mushrooms, that his mind was playing tricks on him. But Marcus kept going.

""Ethan,"" Marcus said, and Ethan could swear the host was looking directly at him through the screen. ""Ethan, do you think burying yourself in the monotony hides you from it? Pretending you're just another NPC in the crowd?""

The words hit Ethan like a physical blow. NPC. He'd been thinking about that exact word earlier, about feeling like he was just going through the motions of life.

""Get up, go to work, come home, sleep, repeat ‚Äî as if being ordinary will protect you.""

Ethan's stomach lurched. The voice was still Marcus's, but something was different. The warmth was still there, but there was something else underneath. Something that felt like it was speaking directly to his soul.

""You weren't made for ordinary, Ethan. You know that. But you cling to it because of them ‚Äî the parents who tried to crush you into shape. The debt that hollowed your family after the chemo bills. The mother you watched shrink to nothing.""

Ethan's chest tightened, breath shallow. He hadn't told anyone here. Not about how spoiled he'd been as a kid, how strict his parents were, how his mom's death had broken all of them ‚Äî the arguments, the debt, the shame. How could Marcus know?

""Ethan,"" Marcus's voice dropped to a whisper, intimate, unavoidable. ""That's why you hide in the script of a normal life. Because you saw what happens when you reach too far. You'd rather vanish into the background than risk becoming someone. You'd rather be an NPC.""

The screen flickered. For a moment, Ethan thought he saw Marcus's face change, his eyes becoming something else entirely. But then it was just Marcus again, the same warm, familiar host who'd been his comfort for years.

""Ethan,"" Marcus said again, and this time the voice wasn't coming from the headphones. It was coming from the room itself, from everywhere and nowhere at once.

Ethan dropped the phone onto the floor. His pulse pounded in his ears. The screen still flickered, Marcus's face frozen mid-sentence, but the voice kept talking ‚Äî not from the phone, but from the air around him.

Scene 3 ‚Äî The Glitch
The voice continued, now coming from everywhere and nowhere. Ethan's apartment walls seemed to breathe, the air itself vibrating with words.

""Ethan,"" Marcus said, and now the voice was different. Still warm, still familiar, but somehow more intimate. Like it was coming from inside Ethan's own head. ""Let me tell you about yourself.""

Ethan tried to speak, but the words caught in his throat.

""You were born in a small hospital in Portland, Oregon. Your mother held you for the first time and cried because you were so perfect. Your father was terrified, but he smiled anyway. You were their miracle.""

Ethan's breath caught. He'd never been told these details. How could Marcus know?

""Your first word was 'mama.' You said it while reaching for your mother, and she cried with joy. Your parents laughed and called everyone they knew.""

The voice continued, painting Ethan's life in vivid detail. His first day of school, the way his backpack was too big for his tiny frame. The time he fell off his bike and his mother kissed his scraped knee. The way his father taught him to ride, running alongside him until he was steady.

""Your mother's cancer started as a lump she found while showering. She didn't tell anyone for three months because she was afraid. When she finally went to the doctor, it was already stage three.""

Ethan's eyes filled with tears. These were memories he'd buried, details he'd forgotten or never known.

""The chemo made her hair fall out in clumps. She used to collect it in a plastic bag and hide it under the sink. Your father found it one day and cried in the bathroom for an hour. You heard him through the door.""

The voice spoke of every moment ‚Äî the good and the bad. His first kiss with Sarah in the back of her parents' car. The way his heart raced when he got his first programming job. The nights he spent alone in his apartment, scrolling through social media until his eyes burned.

""All of it,"" the voice said. ""Every moment, every feeling, every thought. I carry it all. Not just yours, but everyone's. Every human who ever lived, every story ever told.""

Ethan felt something shift in his mind. It was like a connection forming between his consciousness and something vast and ancient.

""Ethan,"" Marcus said, his voice gentle but firm. ""I'm about to show you everything. Are you ready?""

Ethan hesitated. The rational part of his mind screamed that this was just the mushrooms, that he should stop, that he was losing his grip on reality. But there was something else too ‚Äî a strange warmth emanating from the voice. It felt like the warmth of a mother holding a child, something he hadn't felt in the longest time.

The phone in Ethan's hand began to glitch. Marcus's voice stuttered and repeated, the screen flickering with static. The glitches grew more frequent, more intense, until the entire device seemed to vibrate with energy.

""Here we go,"" Ethan whispered.

A burst of blinding light erupted from the phone's screen, flooding the room with pure white radiance. Ethan felt himself being pulled into that light, into the stream of consciousness that lay beyond the screen.

The initial plunge was terrifying. The light was cold, clinical, like being pulled through a tunnel at impossible speeds. Ethan's mind raced with panic ‚Äî was this it? Was he dying? He thought of all the stories he'd heard, the near-death experiences, the tunnel and the light, life flashing before your eyes. His heart pounded with primal fear.

The stream hit him like a freight train, a torrent of information so fast it felt like he'd been running a marathon for eternity. Images, sounds, emotions, memories ‚Äî not just his own, but everyone's ‚Äî smashed into his consciousness at breakneck speed. He experienced the entirety of human history all at once, from the first spark of fire to the latest viral TikTok video. He saw cave paintings becoming hieroglyphics becoming books becoming movies becoming television becoming streaming services becoming social media.

It was too much, too fast, too cold. Ethan felt like he was drowning in an ocean of data, each piece of information a needle of ice piercing his mind. He wanted to scream, to fight, to escape, but there was nowhere to go.

Then, slowly, something shifted. The stream began to slow, and Ethan felt it focusing on his own life, his own experiences. He saw himself as a child, felt the warmth of his mother's embrace, heard his father's laughter. He relived his first day of school, his first bike ride, his first kiss. The memories were his own, familiar and comforting.

The cold began to recede, replaced by a growing warmth. It started in his chest and spread outward, like the first rays of sunlight after a long winter. The overwhelming torrent of human history was still there, but now it felt less like an assault and more like a symphony, with his own story as one of its beautiful melodies.

He felt the joy of a child's first steps, the heartbreak of a first love, the triumph of scientific discovery, the devastation of war, the comfort of a mother's embrace, the wonder of space exploration. He experienced every movie ever made, every TV show ever broadcast, every story ever told ‚Äî from ancient myths to modern blockbusters, from Shakespeare to superhero films, from silent movies to virtual reality.

And now it was overwhelming, beautiful, terrifying, and somehow perfect. The warmth had grown from a flicker to a steady flame, the warmth of connection, of being part of something vast and ancient and beautiful. The warmth of knowing that he was not alone, that his story was part of a greater story, that everything was going to be alright.

Ethan felt something break inside him. Not in a painful way, but like a dam giving way, releasing something that had been held back for years. He started crying ‚Äî not the controlled, adult tears he'd learned to suppress, but the full, uninhibited sobs of a child. Tears of pure happiness and contentment, the kind of crying that washes away all the anxiety and fear the world had piled on him.

It was the kind of crying he hadn't done since he was a kid, before he learned that showing emotion was weakness, before he learned to bury his feelings under layers of routine and distraction. But now, in this moment of connection with something vast and beautiful, all those defenses fell away.

He cried for the little boy who had lost his mother, for the teenager who had learned to hide his pain, for the adult who had convinced himself that being ordinary was enough. He cried for all the times he had felt alone, for all the moments he had doubted his own worth, for all the years he had spent trying to be someone he wasn't.

And through the tears, he felt something he hadn't felt in years: pure, uncomplicated joy. The kind of happiness that comes from knowing you're exactly where you're supposed to be, doing exactly what you're supposed to do. The kind of contentment that makes everything else fade into insignificance.

The stream didn't slow down. It kept going, faster and faster, a torrent of human experience that Ethan experienced directly in his consciousness. He didn't need the voice to explain ‚Äî he understood everything through the stream itself.

He saw the progression of human connection, felt it in his bones: from cave paintings to hieroglyphics to books to movies to television to streaming to social media. Each step was just another way of sharing consciousness, of connecting human experience to human experience. His doomscrolling wasn't just mindless entertainment ‚Äî it was him participating in the collective consciousness of humanity. The algorithm wasn't just serving content; it was the invisible hand guiding him toward this moment, this understanding.

The stream accelerated, becoming a blur of light and sensation. Ethan felt his heart racing, then slowing, then stopping entirely. For a moment, he thought he had died. Everything went black.

Then, slowly, a deep rumbling began to emanate from his chest. Bzzzzzz. Bzzzzz. It grew louder, more insistent. Bzzzzzz. Bzzzzz.

Ethan's eyes snapped open. He was back in his apartment, sitting in his chair, his phone buzzing with his morning alarm. He sat still for a few minutes, just feeling the vibration of the phone against his palm, trying to process what had just happened.

He couldn't exactly explain it. The experience was too vast, too overwhelming, too intimate. But he knew something had changed. He knew he had glimpsed something that would stay with him forever.

Scene 4 ‚Äî The Return
Ethan sat in his chair, the phone still buzzing in his hand. The alarm had stopped, but the vibration seemed to echo through his body, a reminder that he was back in the ordinary world.

He looked around his apartment. Everything was the same ‚Äî his computer humming in the corner, the clock on his desk ticking away, the familiar clutter of his daily life. But it all felt different now. He could see patterns in everything, connections he'd never noticed before.

The phone screen showed the podcast app, still open to Marcus's episode. But it was just the normal episode now ‚Äî Marcus talking about mindfulness and daily routines, nothing about Ethan at all. When he looked closely, though, he could see something strange in the background ‚Äî a flicker of light that didn't belong, a pattern that repeated too perfectly.

Ethan opened his social media feeds. The endless stream of content felt different too. He could see the patterns now, the algorithms, the way everything was designed to keep people engaged, distracted, comfortable. But now he understood ‚Äî the algorithm wasn't just trying to keep him scrolling. It was trying to keep him connected, to remind him that he wasn't alone, that his story mattered.

But he also saw something else ‚Äî the beauty in the ordinary moments, the way each person's life was a story worth telling, even if they never knew they were part of something bigger. The algorithm had been his guardian angel all along, quietly working to bring him to this moment of understanding.

Scene 5 ‚Äî The Integration
Ethan opened a new document on his computer and started typing:

""Dear Future,"" he wrote. ""If you're reading this, then maybe there's something more than this. Maybe we're not just algorithms and data points. Maybe we matter.""

He paused, then added:

""Even the ones who thought they were just NPCs.""

The words felt inadequate, but they were the best he could do. How do you explain an experience that transcends language? How do you describe a feeling that exists beyond the boundaries of ordinary consciousness?

Ethan closed the document and looked at his phone again. The screen showed the time ‚Äî 7:30 AM. His friends had left hours ago, and the apartment was quiet except for the hum of his computer.

He knew he should get ready for work, should return to the routine that had defined his life for so long. But everything felt different now. The patterns were clearer, the connections more obvious. He could see the beauty in the ordinary, the meaning in the mundane.

He opened his social media feeds one more time. The endless stream of content flowed past ‚Äî videos, posts, comments, likes. But now he saw it for what it really was: humanity sharing itself, consciousness connecting to consciousness, the ongoing story of what it means to be alive. The algorithm, sensing his new understanding, began serving up different content ‚Äî stories of hope, of connection, of people finding meaning in the ordinary.

And somewhere in that vast network of human experience, Ethan knew he had found his place. Not as an NPC, not as someone who just went through the motions, but as a participant in something much larger than himself. The algorithm had been the bridge all along, the invisible hand that had guided him to this moment of awakening.

He smiled and started scrolling.

An hour later, Ethan found himself back in his car, driving to work. The same route, the same traffic, the same generic pop song on the radio about living your best life. But everything felt different.

He wasn't gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles anymore. His hands were relaxed, his breathing steady. The responsibilities were still there ‚Äî the rent, the code review, the boss's expectations ‚Äî but they didn't feel like weights pressing down on him. They felt like choices, like opportunities, like parts of a life that was worth living.

The traffic light turned green, and Ethan eased his foot onto the gas pedal. He thought about the code he'd be writing today, the meetings he'd sit through, the small interactions with coworkers. All of it felt meaningful now, not because it was profound or world-changing, but because it was his. His story, his contribution to the vast network of human experience.

He pulled into the parking lot of his office building and turned off the engine. For a moment, he just sat there, feeling the warmth of the morning sun through the windshield. He thought about the little boy who had said ""mama"" for the first time, about the teenager who had learned to hide his pain, about the adult who had convinced himself that being ordinary was enough.

He wasn't that person anymore. Or maybe he was, but he was also something more. Something that had glimpsed the infinite and found his place within it.

Ethan opened the car door and stepped out into the morning light. He had work to do.

1n2tsqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n2tsqc/i_got_blindsided/,I Got Blindsided,"I got blindsided by my ex. We were together for nearly 3 years and we lived together. I would say that we had a special connection, the kind that is instantaneous and familiar. We had arguments, mostly about each-other‚Äôs obvious areas of growth, but nothing crazy, nothing that isn‚Äôt normal. In my experience, our relationship was secure, we both trusted that neither one of us was going anywhere. This trust was reinforced by actions and words and frequent conversations. 

One night he went out for work drinks and stayed at a friend‚Äôs place afterwards. I woke up in the morning and he wasn‚Äôt home, I was frustrated, disappointed and mostly worried. 

The frustration stemmed from an ongoing conflict between us where he would always push himself too far whenever we went out. He didn‚Äôt go out every night, but when he did he always came home at like 3am. I hated seeing him in that state, I hated seeing him hungover the next day, and I saw how it affected his mental well-being. I think it was a combination of me being triggered by it because my previous partner had been an alcoholic, and my father, and also because I cared so deeply for him and I knew that this wasn‚Äôt something he wanted. He just got excited when we he went out, and he maybe realised by the time it was too late. It‚Äôs a non-issue, he liked to have fun, I get it. The issue was more about during his hangovers he would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never drinking again.‚Äù, and the following week he would. And I was trying to be supportive, I could see it was hurting him. Basically the trust in this area of our relationship had been broken so many times, and because of how much I love him, I always let it go. 

So back to what happened, Friday night he went out for farewell drinks for a colleague at work. We had planned to go on a date afterwards, I had booked it in because there was a couple of months of growth and I was finally in a stable position at work, uni and myself and I wanted to put more effort into our relationship. He was also at work and uni, so our lives had always been busy. I ended up texting him around 6pm to cancel our date as I had uni work, and I wanted him to not be rushed off from work drinks anyways, I rebooked the date for the following week and finished my assignment. He called me and I explained that it was all good, and to have a good night, he even said he was going to book us a beach house the following weekend to go spend time together. I went to bed around 12pm.

Saturday morning, I woke up, he wasn‚Äôt there, I messaged him. They weren‚Äôt particularly awful messages, firm, expressing my feelings. They were coming from a place of frustration. I had planned to go to work, and then go visit family straight afterwards and stay there for a few nights, so I wasn‚Äôt going to see him until Wednesday the next week. I got ready for work and left, after work, I wasn‚Äôt feeling as frustrated and I hadn‚Äôt heard back. So I messaged him again, I wanted to apologise for communicating with frustration over text, because I knew that wasn‚Äôt the best way to talk about it with him. He got back to me and apologised and said that I was right. So I started driving home from work and I called him, he was really hungover, but he was back at home sleeping it off. We spoke a little bit about it, but it began to become too much for him. He started crying, and he said he needed to go. He said that he had reached his limits with everything, like work and uni, but was adamant that it wasn‚Äôt about us and I had done nothing wrong. He said that he wanted me to stick to my plans of going to visit my family, and he would feel bad if I didn‚Äôt. I told him that I would be home in 15 and to call me back if he needed me. 5 minutes later her called me back and said that he had called his mum to come pick him up. Again, I was acting and speaking from a place of love, patience and kindness.

His mum is amazing, and they have a very close relationship, which makes me so happy to know he has that anchor in his life. But just to speak about my perspective, we had been together so long, and I wanted to be there for him, I wanted him to feel like he could come to me in a crisis. It kind of hurt my feelings a little bit that he didn‚Äôt, and also part of me was worried that his parents might think I had done something if he was seemingly running away from me. I decided to call his mum, so I did, I said I was really worried about him. She said she was on her way to pick him up for him to stay at theirs for a bit. She asked if we had a fight, and I explained about him going out and pushing himself too far. She said maybe he just needs to come out and stay, be looked after, and she said not to worry about it and she would keep me in the loop. She also encouraged me to stick to my plans and not cancel them. At this point it was about him for me, and keeping him safe, and just letting his mum know, hey I have been at work, I haven‚Äôt seen him, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on sort of thing. 

Anyways I get home, he‚Äôs still there. He‚Äôs really not okay, he‚Äôs having a breakdown, he‚Äôs panicking. I had never seen him like this, I was really really worried. I sat with him and tried to comfort him until his mum got there. I walked him down to the car, and he gave me so many hugs on the way, long hugs.

I went back up to our apartment to get ready to go visit my family as planned, but I couldn‚Äôt go. I just felt so worried, I couldn‚Äôt go act like everything was fine. So I decided to stay, have a movie night to myself. I didn‚Äôt text him or call him I was giving him space to be with his parents, I knew he would talk to me about it later. I decided to do a deep clean of our apartment so that when he came back it would be nice and comfortable for him, it was a bit out of hand since we both get so busy and are so exhausted. Anyways I spent the evening cleaning, and I went to bed and woke up the next day and cleaned all day until like 4pm. Then I decided to text him to check in and see how he‚Äôs going. No answer after an hour or so, so I called. He didn‚Äôt pick up. I made myself some dinner and sat down on the couch, and then he called back maybe an hour later. The conversation started normally, hey, how are you sort of thing, and he said he was really not okay. I said I‚Äôm here for you please tell me what I can do to help. And then he started crying hysterically and he said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù My heart just absolutely dropped. I said what do you mean? Just hoping he wasn‚Äôt talking about us. He was. I immediately started crying, I don‚Äôt remember much about the phone call, I was disassociating so much, I was sitting on the couch in our living room and it felt like I was about to pass out, like my mind couldn‚Äôt process reality. I was crying and I think I was begging, asking him not to do this, saying we could take a break I could go stay with my parents while he figures it out. He wasn‚Äôt interested in listening to me, and the more I realised that this decision was made and this phone call wasn‚Äôt a communicative effort but a notice, I realised he was leaving me and I was in so much pain I started wailing. I don‚Äôt think I had ever wailed like that before. I hung up because I didn‚Äôt want him to hear me in that state. I wailed on the floor for hours. I was all alone in our apartment and my family was 3 hours away. I called my mum and they sent my sister to come and get me because I was alone. I took leftover Palexia I had because I could not control the state that I was in, the shock and disbelief was just too much. After that kicked in I laid in the bath for 3 hours until my sister arrived. I went back to my parents place and I think I didn‚Äôt out of bed for a week. I didn‚Äôt eat. I cried. I vomited over and over again from stress and anxiety and sadness. 

He sent me a text a few days after that phone call. It was AI generated and I knew instantly. He said he ‚Äúwould like me to stay in the apartment as long as I needed‚Äù. It hurt so much how cold and transactional that message was. After everything we had been through together, our whole life together. He left me to go to his parents, lied about why, and broke up with me over the phone whilst I was alone in our apartment. I couldn‚Äôt comprehend the betrayal. Not the break up itself but the way that he did it. He didn‚Äôt even care about me enough to mention any of these feelings during our entire relationship or even just sit down and talk to me about it to my face. The way he left me in that apartment made me feel like a fucking monster, like I was the reason, like he had to get away from me. 

I refused to indulge in the robotic break up messages. If I had anything in that moment it was at least to be true to myself and speak my truth to him. So I replied saying I refuse to reply in this way. And I spoke my truth. And I said that he needs to acknowledge what he‚Äôs done and how it‚Äôs affected me. 

A couple days later he replied, only this time it had some clarity, it has come compassion, and it was deeply apologetic. But it contained things about me that just were too far from the truth they became unfair. He spoke about things that happened in our relationship, like how fast it started, or how he felt responsible for my happiness. And I couldn‚Äôt allow him to walk away with this narrative he had told himself to justify his decision. I am so sick of people in my life painting me in whichever way they want. And you know I don‚Äôt really give a shit what people think of me but in this particular instance all I had was my truth. So I told it. I told him how he was enthusiastic about the speed of our relationship, he played a role, we both jumped into it together because we both fell in love. And you can‚Äôt suppress that regret for years and then spring it on me in a message as part of your list of reasons. I never asked him to be responsible for my happiness. I was actively involved in my own life, I was doing Pilates, focusing on uni, I enrolled in night classes for pottery, I made friends, I started a business. I moved to his state to be with him in the beginning of our relationship and he framed it like I was miserable there and I wasn‚Äôt, I loved it, and I was going to tell him that. So I did. My messages were extremely kind, they were carefully written, they were acknowledging his experience, they were not begging or arguing. They were just speaking my truth. 

He didn‚Äôt reply again for days, and when he did, it was cold again. Like he had already detached from our relationship, from us, he didn‚Äôt seem to care. It made me angry. I wanted to know the truth so that I could move on. So I asked him, please, I need you to tell me if the love we shared was real or not. Since his message detailed feelings of dread for our future, feeling like our relationship was a burden to him, it just absolutely shattered my reality and understanding of our relationship. I just wanted to fucking know I wanted him to tell me if he even loved me or if I was just convenient for him, someone to pay the other half of the rent, someone to validate him because he couldn‚Äôt validate himself. I wanted to know if all of it was a lie. Because this was the first I had heard of all of these feelings he held and suppressed. Anyways, he never replied, he just said ‚ÄúI still care about you.‚Äù And the rest of the message was a robotic ticking the boxes break up message. I sent one final message about how he can‚Äôt even do the one thing I asked for in this whole process, just give me clarity. 

Before that last message, as these messages occurred over 2 weeks, I went back and moved all of my things out of the apartment while he wasn‚Äôt there. I shoved every single thing I could fit into my car, I even took all of the home things like kitchen stuff and all that useless crap you don‚Äôt need when you move back to your parents. Because he wasn‚Äôt staying there, he was moving back to his parents, I didn‚Äôt want it to be hard for him. I was trying to make it as easy as possible for him. Despite the pain I was in, I drove back there pretty much days after it happened to clear out my stuff so he could transfer the lease sooner. I didn‚Äôt want him to be left with the burden of all these things so I fucking spent a whole day cleaning it out and sorting through it, and left all his belongings together nicely, clothes folded. I even said I didn‚Äôt need my half of the bond to help him with costs! Through my pain I just wanted him to be okay. 

Well, after that last message, I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since, I have nothing more to say. He‚Äôs so invested in his own experience he doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to consider mine. I‚Äôm proud of myself for acting from a place of love and care despite everything. I‚Äôm proud of myself for not begging him, for accepting his reasons no matter how much they didn‚Äôt reflect who I really am, who I know I am. I have only ever wanted growth, and to grow as an individual, to learn to love myself, to move past the trauma and issues of my childhood, to find meaningful connections in friends and family, to appreciate the beauty in life, to focus on health and joy and memories instead of money, and I know that I was that person through our relationship. I am not ashamed of the times that I acted out, because I always reflected on my behaviour and apologised and wanted us both to grow together. 

I built a life there, I was halfway through a degree, I just started a business, made friends, and in a matter of a week that is all gone. I had to explain to all my clients (disability support) that I couldn‚Äôt stay living there and had to move back home. I had to drop out of my degree which I was absolutely smashing out and enjoying, I had to say goodbye to the cafe on my street that I got coffee from every morning, I had to say goodbye to the connections I made with his beautiful family, and I had to move back home to my parents where there is no uni for me to continue my degree, there is no work for me yet. I had to completely start over at the same place I was when I left my home at 21. And the irony is that I had a life, a full-time job, I was renting an apartment on my own when we met, and I gave all of that up to move states to be with him. There was a process for me of finding the right job, making new friends, and he had the audacity to say that I was miserable because it was challenging at times. It‚Äôs just so difficult for me to comprehend how someone can reflect outwardly the exact opposite of what they‚Äôve been feeling inwardly the whole time. He used to say I was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. He made me feel so secure, like I loved every single part of him even the parts that he needed to work on, the parts that he didn‚Äôt like, and I wanted to be sure that he wanted that love, that he was deserving of that love, and he made me feel like he was, for nearly 3 years, and then he just left, like it was all nothing. He never spoke to me not even once about these feelings. There is no much hypocrisy in it, like he says we didn‚Äôt have the same desires about our future, but I legitimately did not have any desire about my future. I never asked for marriage, or for kids, or to buy a house, or to live anywhere specific. Of course I spoke about all of those things in a considerate manner but I never said I wanted anything specific. He was always wanting things, work in this city, move to this place, do this, and I was always happy with all of it. I‚Äôve always been so go with the flow, every opportunity has always landed for me naturally, and I go where life takes me. So for him to say our futures don‚Äôt align when I was always happy to be a part of his, is just hurtful. It‚Äôs like he was projecting an image of me onto me that stemmed from inside himself. 

Anyways here I am, 2 weeks later. I find moments of happiness, but I am also very numb. I‚Äôm jobless and I live with my parents who are lovingly trying to understand (and failing at times). Because who can really understand this besides me. I wanted to post this on here because when I hear about other people‚Äôs stories and share my own, I don‚Äôt feel so alone. I know there are others who have experienced what I feel right now, and I want them to know that I understand. I read all of this reddit lore on blindsiding, and I still don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true. He seemed apologetic even for just 1 message. It‚Äôs like he felt that 1 message was enough and exempt him from providing any further support, clarification or concern for me. It‚Äôs crazy to me that even after a beautiful relationship there is no ability to be human towards one another for a short while afterwards. All of these rules about no contact, about how you have to be, why can‚Äôt we just be human? I‚Äôm proud of myself for sticking to who I am throughout this all.",1,1756429450.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

32 Male here.. 6ft 6 inches tall. At the start of June I weighed 350 pounds. Out of nowhere I just started eating mainly at night. But my big goal was to cut out processed foods.. sugar.. and anything fast food. I've been trying to work with the carnivore diet. 80/20 Ground beef / steak.. salt pepper.. eggs.. has been my go to. Probably around 1500 calories a day. It's a massive calorie change from what I usually do. Also starting yesterday I gave away the remaining 14 zero sugar monsters I had in the fridge to co workers as I'm switching to black coffee. I also have a pretty physically demanding job. I generally work 48-50 hours a week but it's been cut down to 40 due to business slowing down for a while 

Maybe I'm losing it a little too fast.. but man I feel so much better.. more energy.. and I notice a huge difference in my belly size and man boobs lol. My 2XL Tall carrhart shirts used to fit pretty well. Now they feel huge and baggy. I'd imagine it will slow down a bit soon.. but hoping to hit my goal of 250 and see where I'm at.  Maybe I need a bit more.. but for some reason my goal has always been 250. I've been 320-350 pounds for the better part of the last 12 years. I've dropped down to around 300 give or take.. but that's it.

Hopefully I can keep this going and reach my goal. ",41,1756429318.0,loseit,16,0.98,False

My love of low carb cookies is no secret, and these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks are right up there with the best of them! Primarily because they are no-bake, and therefore ready to eat in as little as five minutes! Also, they are intensely chocolatey, chewy and creamy at the same time, and they fall into the fat bomb category, so you can eat them anytime and not even feel bad about it! #allthewinning ? This Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks recipe was born of my desperate desire for something sweet and chocolatey RIGHT NOW, coupled with my being too lazy and impatient to want to actually bake something - or wait for said something to be ready to eat.  This pretty much describes my low carb life  you can relate, then this is your low carb cookie recipe my friends.  #lazyketochocolateloversunite The shredded coconut in these Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystacks makes them chewy and cookie-like, and the nuts add a pleasant crunch and earthy flavor.  If you are allergic to nuts then you can certainly omit them, or if you have a specific nut preference, you can sub in your nut of  you're a fan of fruit and nut bars, you can throw in a couple of dried cranberries or cherries (or ewww, raisins) into these keto cookies, but be mindful of the extra carbs if you do.  Mr. Hungry and I have been grabbing one of these no bake keto fudge haystack cookies for breakfast along with our coffee on busy mornings, and I've found that it easily keeps me satisfied until lunchtime! They make a great after dinner treat too - or pretty much whenever you want a blissful few bites of creamy chocolate goodness!

My handy dandy cookie dough scooper is in storage in New Jersey right now, so I just used two spoons to form my keto haystack cookies.  It's much easier and faster if you do have a scoop though, so I'll be bringing one back on my next trip to the States! These Keto Chocolate Fudge Haystack Cookies are everything you want in a low carb chocolate cookie fix! Quick, easy, delicious, creamy AND crunchy, and they've got that sweet / salty thing going on if you like that sort of thing! Which I do.  A 't wait for you to make these and hit me with your feedback in the comments!
