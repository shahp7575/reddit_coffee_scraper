Drank coffee since I was 15 years old and I drank a lot of coffee over the years.   Diet Coke too.  I quit two weeks ago.  I stepped down from 6 cups of coffee to half caf to decaf to one cup of decaf before finally dropping it.  

But a couple days in to zero caffeine I started experiencing constipation.  Last night I woke up at 2am and got sick because of how backed up I am.  I know what to do to ease it but I also know my body is basically retraining its system after over a decade of having a stimulant.  

I quit before for 3 months but the constipation and feeling like the only way to adult with the flu was coffee.  Now I‚Äôm back at it.  So here‚Äôs my question:  

For those of you long term users how long did it take for your body to adjust without feeling like if your diet, hydration wasn‚Äôt on point you‚Äôd be suffering?  Need a okay just make it a year type motivation.  Odd I know but help me quit smoking.  ",1,1760343281.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1o5dvfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/neon_dreams/comments/1o5dvfn/pre_date_pabic/,Pre date pabic,"The moment the date was confirmed, a switch flipped in Archie‚Äôs brain. The part that usually dealt with low-level cosmic chaos and sentient foliage was abruptly repurposed for a far more terrifying task: Impressing A Normal Human Woman.

This, as any wizard will tell you, is a recipe for disaster of the highest order. Calm, focused magic is difficult. Panicked, vanity-fueled magic is like trying to perform open-heart surgery with a blender during an earthquake.

His first mistake was deciding his shirt needed a ""hint of intriguing allure."" This translated to a haphazard Coloreo charm aimed at adding a subtle, shifting sapphire sheen. The spell, infected by his frantic energy, didn't so much tint the shirt as it did infuse it with the conceptual essence of ""Deep Ocean.""

The shirt immediately became damp, slightly salty, and developed a persistent, mournful humming, as if filled with the ghosts of disappointed whales. A fine for ""Unauthorized Aquatic Theming & Unlicensed Ambient Cetacean Noises"" (¬£40) slid under his door.

""Too much?"" Archie asked Barry, holding up the dripping, humming garment.

""It's a start, lad,"" Barry rumbled. ""If she's a fan of lugubrious sea shanties, you're in.""

Next, he decided his hair required ""architectural solidity."" A quick Stabilo charm was meant to lend it a tasteful, windswept hold. Instead, it locked his hair into a single, rigid, helmet-like structure that chimed softly when tapped. A second fine arrived, this one for ""Creating an Unregistered Kinetic Sculpture on One's Own Person"" (¬£65).

Desperate, he turned to his shoes. A simple Polisto charm to make them shine. The shoes achieved a mirror-like finish so profound they began reflecting light from potential futures, showing brief, confusing glimpses of himself spilling coffee on his lap. A third fine, for ""Minor Chronological Contamination of Footwear"" (¬£85), materialized in his pocket.

The kitchen was now a warzone of magical fallout. The aggressively cozy table was trying to comfort the mournful shirt. The spoons were using the chiming hair as an impromptu glockenspiel. Mustard-1 was having a field day, frantically filing appeals against each fine on the grounds that ""pre-date anxiety constitutes a mitigating circumstance of temporary insanity.""

""YOU ARE A WRECK, ARCHIE LAD!"" Barry boomed over the din. ""JUST GO AS YOU ARE! TELL HER YOU COME WITH YOUR OWN ATMOSPHERIC SOUNDTRACK AND A LEGAL TEAM!""

""I can't!"" Archie wailed, his voice echoing slightly inside his hair-helmet. ""I need to be... more! Or maybe less! I don't know!""

In a final, catastrophic decision, he decided he needed to smell not just good, but conceptually appealing. He uncorked a simple ""Fresh Linen"" scent charm and, in his panic, overloaded it with intent. The spell erupted in a visible cloud of shimmering particles that didn't smell of linen, but of ""The Abstract Concept of Trustworthiness and a Hint of Pine.""

The cloud immediately adhered to everything in the room. Archie now smelled like a politically neutral, reliable forest. The table smelled like a trustworthy woodland. The mournful shirt now smelled like a dependable, if sad, ocean.

The final fine arrived not on paper, but spoken aloud by a miniature, projected simulacrum of Reginald Ponds that appeared on the countertop.

""Mr. Fizzlewink,"" the tiny Ponds said, pinching its tiny nose. ""A cumulative fine for 'Reckless Synthesis of Olfactory Abstracta' and 'General Pre-Date Pandemonium.' The total is ¬£250. The date is now, officially, a Ministry-monitored event. A scrying orb will be discretely positioned in the sugar bowl. For safety.""

The projection vanished.

Archie stood amidst the chaos: damp, chiming, reflecting potential futures, and smelling like the poster boy for ethical forestry. He looked at the clock. He was due to leave in ten minutes.

He sank onto a chair, which let out a comforting sigh that somehow also smelled trustworthy.

""Right,"" he said to no one in particular, his voice hollow with defeat. ""This is as good as it's going to get.""

He had set out to become more appealing and had instead become a walking, talking, multi-sensory regulatory violation. He had a date in ten minutes. And a sugar bowl was going to be watching. It was, he supposed, just another Tuesday.",1,1760343098.0,neon_dreams,0,1.0,False

1o5dqfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/neon_dreams/comments/1o5dqfu/she_said/,She Said...,"The approval arrived not with a romantic fanfare, but with the soft, administrative thud of a triplicate form being spat from the clay pot onto the kitchen table. The ""Certificate of Pre-Approved Social Interaction (Non-Magical, Coffee-Based)"" was stamped, signed, and had several clauses manually underlined in what Archie recognized as Reginald Ponds‚Äôs weary handwriting, including a specific addendum: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòCompulsory Contentment‚Äô aura of your table is NOT to be considered a natural mood-enhancer. Any reported feelings of well-being must be self-generated.‚Äù

Archie, his heart performing a rhythm more suited to a terrified rabbit than a potential suitor, dialed Elara‚Äôs number. He had rehearsed this. He had the form propped up next to the phone for moral support.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Her voice was still as wonderfully, mundanely melodic as he remembered.

‚ÄúElara? It‚Äôs Archie. From the biscuit aisle. The, uh‚Ä¶ the one with the paperwork.‚Äù

A warm chuckle. ‚ÄúThe form-filler. I remember. Don‚Äôt tell me you need me to sign a waiver for this call?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! No, the pre-approval covers telephonic communication,‚Äù he said, then winced. He was doing it again. ‚ÄúI was wondering‚Ä¶ the forms are all processed. Everything is in order. Would you‚Ä¶ that is, would you perhaps like to get that coffee? With me? At a designated, pre-approved, non-magical venue?‚Äù

There was a pause on the other end of the line. A pause that stretched just long enough for Archie‚Äôs hopes to begin a precipitous crash-landing into the pit of his stomach.

‚ÄúYou know what, Archie?‚Äù Elara said, her tone suddenly flat. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

The world stopped. The cheerful, legally-compliant hum of the kettle seemed to mock him. Even the aggressively cozy table seemed to dim its glow by a few lumens. Archie‚Äôs carefully rehearsed speech evaporated from his mind, leaving behind a blank, beige void of disappointment.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he managed, his voice small. ‚ÄúRight. Of course. I understand. It was‚Ä¶ it was a lot to ask. With the forms and everything. Sorry to have bothered‚Äî‚Äù

He was cut off by her laughter, a sound that was now free of its previous teasing and full of genuine amusement. ‚ÄúOh, Archie, your voice! I‚Äôm joking! Of course I‚Äôll get coffee with you. I just had to see what you‚Äôd do. You‚Äôre the most strangely fascinating man I‚Äôve ever met.‚Äù

Relief flooded through him, so potent it probably triggered a sensor in a minor ministry somewhere. He sagged against the wall. ‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶ a joke?‚Äù

‚ÄúA terrible one, I admit,‚Äù she said, her laughter subsiding into a warm smile he could hear through the phone. ‚ÄúBut after a multi-part form just to ask me out, I felt a little teasing was in order. So, when and where?‚Äù

As they finalized the details for a perfectly ordinary coffee at a perfectly normal caf√©, a final scroll pinged from the clay pot. It was a single line.

NOTICE: Social interaction proceeding within approved parameters. A post-date debrief form (SOC-DB-2) will be issued upon completion of the event.

Archie didn‚Äôt care. He had a date. A real, actual date. With a woman who found his labyrinthine, bureaucratically-cursed life ""fascinating.""

He hung up the phone, a slow, dazed smile spreading across his face.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Barry the Petunia boomed. ‚ÄúDo we need to prepare a character witness statement for the caf√©? I can attest to your‚Ä¶ unique qualities.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe said yes,‚Äù Archie said, almost to himself.

‚ÄúA bold strategic move,‚Äù Mustard-1 squeaked, making a note. ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòfeigned refusal‚Äô is a classic negotiation tactic designed to assess resolve. She is clearly a formidable intellect.‚Äù

Archie ignored them both. He looked at the pile of paperwork, at his sentient kitchen, at his legally-complex life. For the first time, the chaos didn't feel like a prison. It felt, improbably, like a backdrop. And he was about to step out from behind it, if only for a coffee.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said, his smile finally reaching his eyes. ‚ÄúNow, what does one wear to a non-magical, pre-approved social interaction?‚Äù",1,1760342546.0,neon_dreams,0,1.0,False

And things in our relationship have been going down hill for over half of that. She‚Äôs not seeming happy anymore, or for at least the most part. And it‚Äôs making me feel sad too. I‚Äôm finding that it‚Äôs making me more sad and stressed than anything else in my life currently, and my mates have said I seem sad around her.

Our intimate life is barely a thing, and has been for 8 months ish. She gets really angry with me for ‚Äúwanting to do stuff all the time‚Äù but we only seen each other once a week due to college and her parents. I feel like she anting to do stuff when we see each other is fine but I‚Äôm starting to doubt myself. She  also went through a phase of saying that she‚Äôs only doing stuff for me, which freaked me out loads and made it so that I didn‚Äôt wanna do anything for a while. When starting stuff I‚Äôm always the one to initiate, and it‚Äôs making me feel unwanted. She has also started saying recently after things that she wanted me to do the work as she dint have the energy to do anything, which has been making me feel horrible about doing things.

I‚Äôve been thinking recently about ending the relationship because of the way it‚Äôs making me feel. But I feel really guilty about it because of some of the things she‚Äôs saying. She‚Äôs said that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her only source of happiness‚Äù and the I‚Äôm ‚Äúher only friend‚Äù and it‚Äôs making me feel a little trapped in my own head because I‚Äôm scared of what she‚Äôll do and think if we break up. She‚Äôs also been asking for a lot of reassurance about us recently and it‚Äôs killing me saying that we are okay. I still love her, but i don‚Äôt feel happy anymore and it‚Äôs a huge deal for me as I‚Äôve had massive mental health problems in the past.

I started hormones 02/19/24 and now im 20 going on two years on T. Ive had so many changes with my body and just me, as a am, who am i, and how i live.

recently ive been looking back at alot of pictures of me pre transition. i was such a pretty girl. i wanted this life for myself that sometimes i still want now, now more then ever for some reason.

i envision myself with my long curly hair, nails just done, lashes on, in a red branco with my collections of cups snd gym clothes. i envision me and my cat and all my jewelry i wear because theres so much. having a group of girl friends who make fun of men and are cunty and bossy. i envision this life that feels amazing. i want it to be me. it is me somewhere in me, maybe buried deep below.

theres the man i am right now too. im struggling. im alone with no friends, in a school that thinks im a freak for being trans, i would say im pretty passing, and at a job that is full of drama and stress. my family isnt accepting of me. i live alone in my dorm and dont really have anyone around me ever. its not like i dont try but im scared. im u sure if thats why im feeling this way or not.

then i think back and remember how uncomfortable my skin was. how dysphoric i would get over my chest and how i hated my voice and talking. i remember showering in the dark and the way my periods made me want to no longer walk this planet because of the dysphoria i would feel.

then theres me now. im an adult, still growing, but still thinking about this. as the days pass on i feel this feeling more and more but a push back as well. like two people are fighting each other in my head. like literally i mean two different people.

the man i am who wants to be a dad and be big snd muscular in a lean way with a mustache and goate and drive a mustang. the one who has plants that are easy to care for and is always sipping on coffee and is a nerdy weirdo.

and the women on me who is still me?

i dont know what to do who to go to or how to feel? im wondering if anyone can give me advice. i feel like a freak and so alone in this experience. i feel too far gone to even consider detransitions because i fell like i will never look like the same girl, i dont want to go by my deadname tho? i can‚Äôt detransition? im so confused.",2,1760342215.0,actual_detrans,1,1.0,False

1o5dmgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/neon_dreams/comments/1o5dmgt/digestives_and_paperwork/,Digestives and Paperwork,"It was a daring, almost revolutionary act. Archie Fizzlewink was going shopping. For groceries. In a normal supermarket. Without the intent to use any of the items for magical purposes beyond their designated, mundane functions. It felt wildly transgressive.

He was in the biscuit aisle, engaged in the deeply philosophical debate of whether chocolate digestives constituted a balanced breakfast, when he saw her. She was examining a packet of hobnobs with a faint, critical frown that Archie found utterly captivating. She had hair the colour of a well-brewed cup of tea and a scarf that seemed to defy the drab lighting of the supermarket with its cheerful, non-regulation hues.

Their carts bumped.

""Oh! I'm so sorry,"" she said, her voice a pleasant, melodic sound that was entirely devoid of any spectral whispering, legal pedantry, or floral judgement.

""It was my fault,"" Archie blurted out, his own voice sounding strangely rough from disuse in normal conversation. ""I was... contemplating the structural integrity of digestives.""

She smiled. ""A noble pastime. They're good for dunking, but the hobnob has superior crunch-to-chocolate ratio.""

""A connoisseur,"" Archie said, feeling a boldness he hadn't known since the Great Kettle Repair.

They fell into step, discussing the merits of various baked goods. Her name was Elara. She was a librarian. She appreciated order, but also the quiet, chaotic potential of stories. Archie was, for the first time in living memory, having a normal, pleasant, and utterly magical conversation with another human being.

He was just working up the courage to ask if she'd like to continue this discussion over a coffee (properly kettle-boiled, of course), when a familiar pop sounded directly above his head.

A scroll of parchment, smelling unmistakably of Reginald Ponds' personal brand of disappointment, materialized and bonked him gently on the nose before unfurling in mid-air between him and Elara.

Elara blinked. ""Is that... aerial calligraphy?""

¬∑ Section B: A sworn affidavit that you will not, under any circumstances, use magic to enhance your date (e.g., Ambioso charms on the surroundings, Purgo on your person, or unlicensed weather control to create a ""romantic drizzle"").
¬∑ Section C: A full risk assessment of potential conversational topics, with special attention to the ""High-Risk Subject"" of your own domestic situation.

Please return the completed forms in triplicate to the Department of Social & Emotional Thaumaturgy. A response will be provided within 5-10 business days.

Elara read the form, her expression shifting from confusion to dawning amusement. ""You... need a permit to ask me out?""

""It's... a long story,"" Archie mumbled, his ears burning with a heat that could have boiled a kettle without magic. ""I have a... regulated lifestyle.""

Back at home, he slammed the form on the kitchen table. The table, still radiating its aggressive coziness, tried to soothe him. He was not soothed.

""This is an OUTRAGE!"" Mustard-1 squeaked, already drafting a legal challenge. ""The right to pursue happiness is a fundamental‚Äî""

""Shut it, you,"" Barry boomed. ""Let the lad suffer in peace. This is the most entertainment we've had since the spoons unionized.""

Archie stared at the form. Section B, Sub-clause ii specifically forbade ""the use of any magically-induced charm, pheromone, or aura, including but not limited to, 'Compulsory Contentment' fields generated by furniture.""

He looked at Elara's phone number, which she had, miraculously, scribbled on the back of a supermarket receipt with a wry smile and the words, ""Good luck with the paperwork.""

For a moment, a wild, rebellious thought flashed in Archie's mind. He could just call her. He could just... do it. Without the form.

The air in the kitchen shimmered. A second form, this one bright red and labelled ""PRELIMINARY CEASE & DESIST: UNAUTHORIZED SOCIAL INTERACTION,"" materialized directly in front of his face.

""Right,"" Archie sighed, the fight draining out of him. He picked up a pen.

""Right,"" he repeated, and began to fill out the form.

In the ""Proposed Location for Interaction"" box, he wrote: A coffee shop. A normal one. Not my kitchen.

It felt like a start. A slow, bureaucratically-entangled, soul-crushingly documented start. But a start, nonetheless. He had met a girl. And now, he had to petition the universe for the right to buy her a cup of coffee. It was, he supposed, progress. Of a sort.",1,1760342133.0,neon_dreams,0,1.0,False

1o5dix0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o5dix0/im_lost_as_a_person_and_im_freaking_out_more_and/,I'm lost as a person and I'm freaking out more and more about it.,"

I'm lost as a person, I don't know who I even really am.

I'm 29 year old guy. I'm diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and bipolar. It's something I struggle with every day. I've tried to take my own life previously, suffered from self harm. I can sit here and list every negative trait I can see like I'm looking into a mirror.

I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I just got my license for the first time in my life in July. It was freeing to finally have mobility. I've been going out to card shops and playing magic with people and being social, and it's helped me feel alive socially. It's the one good thing I feel like I have going for me.

I still struggle socially. I haven't had a girlfriend since 2018. I've only dated twice, both lasting about 6 months. My first girlfriend cheated on me and left me for someone who dumped her within a month. My second girlfriend dumped me, and then started false accusations against me. Saying I assaulted her, and stalked her. She got engaged and married 5 months after dumping me, she and her husband followed me and tried to get me fired from my job or get me banned from various places she knew I frequented. I haven't dated since, and any attempt I have made has ended poorly. I took about 4-5 years to figure myself out socially and try to better myself so I could be a better partner than I was, because honestly I wasn't the best but I didn't deserve what had happened. Now it's a mix of being told how my attempt to ask someone out for coffee or just to get to know them was cute or endearing or just being ghosted once they feel my awkwardness. I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but it feels like slamming my head into a wall trying to not imagine myself dying alone. I struggle with incel thoughts, I refuse to stoop that low. It's frustrating knowing people who literally don't bathe and somehow having a partner constantly.

Career wise? I have no clue. Growing up I wanted to get into game development, then it transformed into voice acting. College was a fluke and I dropped out my junior year due to FASFA fucking me over. I worked food service for 4 years, I got a job doing cold call sales and made it 9 months before they were going to fire me. I tend to lose myself in work and just abuse myself by working long hours to forget it all. My most recent job was 2 1/2 years working as a business development rep for a shitty company who paid me $17. The best thing I did at that job was get the company in legal trouble as I caught them committing wage theft.

I quit that job in July, I moved at the end of August to my Dad's house about an hour away. I'm broke and feel like an absolute burden on my father who wants to retire. I just got accepted into a local community college for electrical engineering. I don't have any passion for it, I just want a job to work and stop being dead broke.

I'm lost for what to do with any of it. I was once told by someone that I was put on this planet to create something, and I know that's true. I feel like I have things that I want to open up to the world and say for others to see and relate to. I adore the band NIN and see how it's writing from a fragile, intimate place and I feel like it's a calling of mine to do the same, not necessarily with music but something. But I have no outlet, I have no drive to do any of it. I have so many thoughts trapped in here with myself and it's eating away at me.

There's only been one thing in my life I woke up with a smile doing, and it feels pathetic. It was competitive magic the gathering. I traveled 2 times within the state for large multi-thousand people tournaments. My very first one I went 6-4 on day one, a single win away from making day 2 and winning money. I've won small events at local shops and it's such a rush understanding how deep and complex this nerdy game is. That was in 2018, I stopped playing shortly after that but only recently picked the game back up and my god do I want to do it again. I want to get into Legacy and Vintage, but I have no money for it. It's sad to say, but it's what is making me want to get a career, I want to buy hundreds of dollars of cardboard, fly out to a different state and sit down and play competitively. It's such a rush and a positive feeling for me. Shout out to Brian Coval, I've lived vicariously through his videos of watching high level play with sheer awe.

I've sat here writing this during a 3am manic episode, I'm safe and have no thoughts of doing anything stupid. I just don't know what I want to do anymore. Thank you for listening to my scream into the void.",1,1760341744.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

# Key takeaways

* Your career profile is not just your CV. Carefully crafting your profile into a clear, compelling narrative and succinct pitch will elevate your success in the job search
* Networking is key to accessing the hidden job market, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be cringey or inauthentic
* Preparing for interviews is more than just thinking about answers to typical interview questions. Extensive research, deep analysis, forming a point of view and aligning on a 90-day plan will help you stand out

# Introduction

Welcome to part 6 of my Salary Series! In my previous post, I discussed the¬†[dynamics of the recruitment marketplace](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). The purpose of that post was to provide you with a deep understanding of how hirers search for and shortlist candidates. In this post, we‚Äôre going to leverage that information to help you succeed in the job search.

From my observations, the average candidate would search and apply for opportunities by:

* Searching for jobs on one, at most two job platforms (JobStreet by SEEK and/or LinkedIn)
* Mass apply for jobs, using one standard CV or a customised CV leveraging AI (which doesn‚Äôt give you an advantage)
* Hope and pray for a response
* Attend interviews with limited research based on browsing the company website

I‚Äôm here to help give you some different meta strategies to elevate your job search game.

Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Disclaimer:**¬†I won‚Äôt be covering basic information that is easily found elsewhere. I‚Äôm going to assume you already know the basics and have the same knowledge and process steps that the ‚Äúaverage candidate‚Äù has.

# Advanced job search strategies

In the job search process, standing out to get the best opportunities and offers requires a lot more effort than you might imagine.. As a result, the job search process starts a lot earlier than you think. There‚Äôs a whole lot of preparation, extensive search and networking, as well as in-depth research to perform for each opportunity.

In each section below, I‚Äôll provide detailed information on what an above-average job-searcher would be doing. I won‚Äôt be covering generic, basic advice that you can easily find (so I expect you know the basics).

# 1.0 Profile Development

The first and most important step in the job search is building up a high-impact, attractive and credible profile. This includes your personal brand, credentials and experience. From day one of your first job, you need to build a strong personal brand, with the right skills, with the right work experience. Of course, these would need to be aligned with your career goals and objectives. Without a strong profile, your job search will be many, many times harder.

Whatever the case, your profile as of now is what it is, and you have to make the best of it.

# 1.1 Detailed CV Knowledge Bank

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

The first step I highly recommend is to develop a detailed CV knowledge bank, which is essentially¬†**a database of every single responsibility, initiative and achievement throughout your whole professional career**.

In your typical CV, a single project or achievement is articulated in a single bullet point. In a detailed CV, that one bullet point is expanded to be half a page or even one whole page. The detailed CV may be 20, 30 or even 50 pages long.

Yes, it will take some time. And a lot of effort trying to search for and compile all your past information, data points and feedback from all your past work experience. But it‚Äôs going to be worth it.

# What‚Äôs the purpose of creating such a document?

* You have a central repository of all your work history, achievements and impact
* This allows you to easily and efficiently customise your job application CV by referring to your repository, picking and choosing the most relevant experiences (a lot better than just customising keywords, am I right?)
* It can be used to prepare responses for difficult situational or behavioural interview questions. By writing it down in extreme, explicit detail, you gain clarity and specificity in the answers that you would have rehearsed
* You can go even deeper with the hirer if requested. There was one opportunity where I was asked for more specific information (on top of my CV) about my experience in Corporate Strategy work. I ended up submitting a 10+ slide deck with all the relevant Corporate Strategy experience extracted from my detailed CV. Easy peasy

>**BONUS:** Download a [sample of the Detailed CV Knowledge Bank here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-sample-vShare.pdf). Also, I've made available a [Detailed CV Knowledge Bank template](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-template-vShare.pptx) you can download and use

This tool is not going to be useful unless you write down every piece of work you have done in great detail, including quantitative data points, as well as measurable outcomes, as a result of what you have done. You need to write down information such as ‚ÄúFacilitated 4 workshops comprising 75 stakeholders in total, leading to the identification and prioritisation of 150 requirements/user stories.‚Äù

It‚Äôs going to be A LOT of work trawling your whole email archive, shared folders, old CVs, etc., to find and consolidate all the information from your work history. However, future updates will be relatively quick, say 30-60 minutes every quarter.

# 1.2 Career strategy, narrative and elevator pitch

Now that you have compiled your detailed CV, you have built an extensive view of your whole career. It will give you the clarity and foundation to help formulate your vision for your career.

That‚Äôs the next step before performing a job search. Being clear on the career you want, which translates into your career strategy, what pathway you want to take, as well as what you need to do to get there. Your career strategy and pathway give you focus on the types of jobs, industries and companies you should target in your job search.

Which then leads to formulating your profile narrative and elevator pitch.

**The narrative**¬†of your career experience and where it‚Äôs headed. It‚Äôs a compelling story that articulates what you‚Äôve done, why you‚Äôve made certain decisions and what you may aim to do in the future. For example, my narrative is:

>I started out the first 10 years of my career in stockbroking and wealth management in one company, where I was given new opportunities and promotions almost every 2 years due to my ability to deliver results

>Towards the end of those 10 years, I realised that whilst I had great vertical progression, I only had experience in one division, of one company, in one industry my whole career.

>I realised that it was important for my career development to gain a breadth of exposure across many different functions, divisions and companies. That‚Äôs when I decided to pivot into consulting, which would provide that breadth of exposure in a compressed timeframe. Hence, I joined an MBA program that would allow me to exit into consulting

>I also decided to work in Asia, to gain exposure into a different environment and working culture.

>Since the MBA, I have spent another 10 years across two consulting firms and headed up strategy at an investment bank, where I gained significant experience in a broad range of functions and types of financial services firms

>As a next step in my career, I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to consolidate my wealth of experiences in leadership skills into a position that has high visibility and high impact as a senior executive

**Your elevator pitch**¬†is a 30-second summary of your profile and narrative that makes you a unique and highly sought-after candidate. The elevator pitch is something you use when you introduce yourself to a new connection or an interviewer when faced with the ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù question. It needs to be succinct, specific, yet punchy. An example, based on the narrative above, would be:

>*Across my career, I‚Äôve built a unique balance of depth and breadth having both industry and consulting experience. I started as a skilled operator across client management, product management and partnerships in wealth management, where I delivered consistent results and rose rapidly through the ranks. Later, I broadened my perspective through consulting and strategy leadership roles across multiple financial institutions and markets in Asia. What ties it all together after almost 20 years is my ability to navigate complexity, drive clarity, and lead teams to deliver impact. At this stage, I‚Äôm focused on bringing that full spectrum of experience into a senior executive role that allows me to shape strategy and deliver measurable outcomes at scale.*

# 1.3 Online profiles (LinkedIn, Jobstreet, GitHub, etc)

If you don‚Äôt have¬†[LinkedIn¬†](https://www.linkedin.com/)and¬†[Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/)¬†accounts, you‚Äôre limiting your visibility with hirers. Without setting up accounts on these job platforms, you won‚Äôt have an online profile that showcases your professional work experience. Without an online profile, how do you think hirers can find you when they are performing proactive searches for candidates?

Hirers and especially recruiters use these platforms to find matching candidates. As someone who has a complete profile which showcases that I work for top firms with impactful experience, I often get messages and invitations from hirers and recruiters to explore opportunities that they have.

Also, don‚Äôt limit yourself to just¬†[LinkedIn¬†](https://www.linkedin.com/)and¬†[Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/). You should be building your profile in places where people in your industry congregate. For example, if you‚Äôre a software engineer, you should be showcasing your work on¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/).

# 2.0 Pipeline Development

The next step is to start building your pipeline of opportunities. Don‚Äôt forget about the¬†[hidden job market when searching for opportunities](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). You‚Äôll need to track and manage this pipeline through a single process using a single workflow.

# 2.1 Pipeline Management Tool

First of all, you need a pipeline management tool. It‚Äôs a document or file that you can keep track of the job search process, and note down all opportunities you have and manage each opportunity‚Äôs status.

Here‚Äôs a screenshot of what that might look like:

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

You will want to have two sheets in your spreadsheet:

1. **Company list:**¬†A worksheet with a list of companies you are targeting to find opportunities; and
2. **Opportunity list:**¬†A worksheet with a list of identified job opportunities

>**Bonus**: Download a [copy of the template here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx) for your own use

Let me explain how you should update the two lists:

**Company list**

If you‚Äôve ever read the¬†[2-hour job search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/), skip this section. You already know what to do here. I think it‚Äôs a great and highly effective method to not only focus your efforts, but also develop your network.

The very quick summary is as follows:

* List as many companies as you would like to work for. This should take just 10-15 minutes tops
* Do online research to identify companies which are similar to the companies you wrote down on your list. Examples of how to do this:
   * Use the LinkedIn search function with the names of your companies in the list, and use the ‚Äúfind similar‚Äù function. This will help you find other companies which you might want to explore
   * Search by industry/function and browse job listings, look out for companies which you haven‚Äôt heard of and research them
* Map out any connections/networks you know who are currently or previously working in these companies. Use LinkedIn and your contact list. Mark that down in your list
* Score the company list using the instructions I provided in the tool (e.g. look on JobStreet by SEEK and LinkedIn for job ads by that company for ‚ÄúPosting‚Äù score)
* Rank (or rather, sort) the list so the highest score with a potential connection appears at the top of the list

This will result in a list of companies to focus your efforts on, penetrating the¬†[hidden job market](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/)¬†using networks and connections

**Opportunity List**

I list all opportunities in this sheet, even if they‚Äôre not on my Company List sheet. More instructions are¬†[inside the downloadable tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx).

How do I go about searching for opportunities and populating this sheet?

* **Proactive search:**¬†Whenever a recruiter approaches you with an opportunity you might be interested in, record it down
* **Networking:**¬†Whenever someone you have a coffee catch-up or an¬†[informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview)¬†with offers a referral or highlights an opening, record it down
* **Job advertisement search:**¬†The average person uses one, maybe two job portals at most to do their job search. Don‚Äôt be average. I do a ‚Äútotal market scan‚Äù because I‚Äôm a maximiser. Let‚Äôs say I want to find a job in Financial Services (Banks, Insurers, Wealth Management, etc).
   * I would search using:
      * Large job portals:¬†[JobStreet by SEEK](https://www.jobstreet.com/),¬†[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and¬†[Indeed](http://indeed.com/).
      * Specialised job boards:¬†[eFinancialCareers](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/)
      * Company careers page: That company list you created? Visit the careers section for every one of them
      * Recruiters: Michael Page / Page Executive, Robert Walters, Hays, Ambition, Ranstad, etc.
   * That list should amount to 50-60 websites you‚Äôre searching for job opportunities at any one time. Rinse and repeat. Every day for large job portals. The others, weekly.

50 ‚Äì 60 websites for a job search may seem excessive. But you want to make sure you¬†**identify every single relevant opportunity**. Here‚Äôs what you do:

* For large portals, you can save your search criteria so you don‚Äôt have to set it up each time.
* Always ensure you sort the search results from the most recent job ad to the oldest
* Copy into¬†[the tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx)¬†all the opportunities you‚Äôre interested in
* The first time you do this, it may take a few hours (or 1-2 days) to go through every single search result over the past couple of weeks
* But once you‚Äôre done with the backlog, if you‚Äôre searching the large portals every day, you only need to scroll through one day‚Äôs worth of new job advertisements based on your search criteria. For each large job portal, that might be just 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes. And the rest of the websites you‚Äôll do weekly, that might be an hour or so once a week

# 2.2 Tapping the hidden job market

Now that we have our pipeline, we need to start focusing on the hidden job market. No point applying for job ads, then sit back and watch Netflix whilst waiting for responses. Time to ensure we get a hold of the best opportunities.

**Proactive search**

If you‚Äôve done your online profiles right (It‚Äôs only taken many, many years of hard work and achievements to build your profile, and just 60 minutes to condense it online), the proactive search opportunities will start coming.

There‚Äôs a lot of information online on how to make your online profile attractive, so I won‚Äôt cover that. Some other important advice:

* Always keep your profile up to date, even when you‚Äôre not job hunting. The more up-to-date the information, the more information the hirer has about you
* Be active. Even if that‚Äôs casually browsing, commenting or liking posts. These platforms inform hirers and recruiters of user behaviour, such as when you‚Äôre browsing job ads, when you‚Äôre reading their company posts, etc. These are strong interest signals
* Instead, show activity on job platforms. Follow companies. Post POVs. Comment, like. Recruiters can see your high-level activity on these platforms. You want to portray yourself as ‚Äúcasually browsing‚Äù, not ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù, which can be a sign of desperation
* Do not put open to work. Unfortunately, there is a hidden stigma around candidates who have their profile as ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù.

**Networking**

Most people have negative perceptions of networking. It‚Äôs cringe. It‚Äôs slimy and inauthentic. It‚Äôs a lot of chest beating and schmoozing.

That‚Äôs what TV shows and inexperienced people tell you about networking.

Most (effective) networking is NOT about turning up to a conference, shaking hands with strangers and exchanging business cards.

The best networkers¬†**grow their network organically and give back more than they receive**. Let me explain.

Ever heard of¬†[six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)? Whilst it may be inaccurate to some degree, the premise can still hold. Why try blind luck in trying to meet others, when your closest connections (friends, family, colleagues) could introduce you to new connections? And when you build a relationship with the new connections, they could potentially introduce you to a whole new degree of connections.

Some tips and tricks to help (because I can write a whole new post about networking):

* **You will always have different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of connections in your network.**¬†You have a close inner circle, a warm network, and a not-so-warm (cold) network. How often you engage with them depends on the level
* **Always be curious and helpful.**¬†When building relationships, be genuinely curious about their perspective, insights and experiences.
* **Give back as much as possible.**¬†Offer to help others without expecting anything in return. Read the book¬†[Give and Take by Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/book/give-and-take/).
* **The best networkers help connect others.**¬†Have a friend in banking who wants to create a fintech startup and wants to learn from a developer? If you know a rockstar developer, connect them
* **Ask to be connected.**¬†Reach out and ask your connections if they know anyone employed in companies on your preferred list, or even generally if they know anyone in that industry or job function that they could connect you to for an informational interview. Rinse and repeat
* **Build and constantly update a networking list.**¬†This may sound weird. Some networkers swear by it. Some don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs a list of your connections, with relevant notes. Most useful information to keep:
   * Profile/background
   * When you last met/talked to them
   * What you‚Äôve talked about and what they have done for you
   * What you have done for them (so you make sure you always do more for others)
   * Interesting information that helps remember who they are and what‚Äôs important to them

To be more specific in the job search context, I think of networking in two general categories:

* **Company-specific networking**
   * Based on the companies you do want to work for, reach out to people who work in these companies to do informational interviews. Sometimes these may be a cold message on LinkedIn or email (reach the¬†[2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/)¬†on how to do this)
   * If you are looking at an opportunity in a different team, ask for a connection referral to meet someone in that team
   * If you don‚Äôt know anyone in that company, use LinkedIn to find second-degree connections, meaning someone who knows someone who works in that company. Ask for a connection referral
* **Industry-wide networking**
   * Connect with others in your network who are in the industry (again,¬†[2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/))
   * Ask to be connected with others, say you‚Äôre looking to explore opportunities across the industry

# 3.0 Interview preparation

Now that you‚Äôre getting opportunities in the pipeline, you‚Äôll need to start focusing on preparing for upcoming interviews.¬† It‚Äôs more than just thinking about the answers to a few questions and watching a few YouTube videos on how to answer generic interview questions.

# 3.1 Background research

On top of the usual background research, such as browsing the company‚Äôs website and annual reports to understand how the business works, its history, scope, mission and vision, etc., you should be going deeper and more specific into your functional area.

Additional avenues of research are:

* Connections within your network who currently or have previously worked in the company
* Glassdoor and similar websites to understand the general employee sentiment, what people think about the culture, ways of working, etc.
* Interviews, news articles and podcasts from company leaders, especially those that are from your functional area of the organisation. This helps you understand how they think, the challenges that they‚Äôre trying to solve, trends they are monitoring, and what their priorities are
* GenAI / LLMs now offer deep research capabilities. Use this to your advantage
* Analyst reports if the company you‚Äôre interviewing for is publicly listed
* Industry publications and reports for wider information about the market they‚Äôre in

# 3.2 Deep dive analysis

**Analysis is different from research**. Research is gathering information. Analysis is interpreting the data to gain insights that will help you gain a deeper understanding and your point of view on the company

Overall, you‚Äôll want to understand the key trends and challenges the company is facing, its strategy, and how this affects the role and the team that you‚Äôre interviewing for.

Examples of analysis that you could conduct:

* **Competitive analysis:**¬†If the role you‚Äôre applying for is a strategic, commercial or similar role where understanding the competitive landscape is important, you‚Äôll want to understand the competitive environment. Market shares, competitive advantages, points of differentiation, competitive responses, etc.
* **Sales productivity:**¬†Understanding the productivity of the sales / frontline team. If you‚Äôre interviewing for a sales leader role, you could analyse and benchmark how productive the sales force is versus competitors (e.g. revenue per sales headcount, revenue per branch, etc)
* **Product deployment velocity:**¬†If you‚Äôre interviewing for a product manager or software engineer role, you could analyse the ‚Äúchangelog‚Äù for a mobile app, feature announcements, etc., and map a timeline of new features and product announcements over time. You can then also compare that to product/tech headcount or expenses, in addition to increases in capital expenditures for new technologies, to uncover insights into how effective they are in deploying human and financial capital to develop new products, as well as how fast their product development cycle is and how it has changed over time.

The types of analysis you could do have no bounds. It really depends on the type of role you‚Äôre applying for. You just need to spend some time thinking about what would be a meaningful analysis that you can then extend into great probing questions to ask, or into your point of view on how to solve those challenges you have uncovered from your analysis.

If possible, do try to validate some of your analysis with anyone in your network that is in a position to do so (without breaching any confidentiality or divulging private company information).

# 3.3 Preparing for interview questions

Now that you have an in-depth view of the company, the function and role you‚Äôre applying for, the next step is to prepare responses to questions that may be asked in the interviews.

There‚Äôs a mountain of information online about this, so I‚Äôll cover the most important principles to elevate how you respond to interview questions:

* Develop a response bank for interview questions. Write‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶ down. No excuses. Don‚Äôt think about the responses in your head and assume you‚Äôve prepared. Word document, Excel, PowerPoint, or physical notebook. Doesn‚Äôt matter. This is mandatory, so don‚Äôt skip it
* Use the research and deep dive analysis you have conducted to formulate responses that are specific, deep and insightful (if this applies to any of the questions)
* The best overall strategy is to ‚Äústeer‚Äù your answers to reinforce your elevator pitch and career narrative. This paints a congruent profile that showcases you as the strongest candidate.
   * If your elevator pitch is that you‚Äôre the best deal closer for Enterprise Sales, design the interview responses accordingly. For example, when asked a question ‚Äúhow do you deal with conflict?‚Äù, you could use a story of how your pre-sales consultant angered a potential new client, but you managed to resolve the conflict, which led to the client signing a deal with you.
* Practice your responses out loud in front of a mirror. Even better, record your practice sessions and watch them. The best communicators do this as part of presentation preparation
* Do live interview practice with a partner. This is the closest and best way to prepare for real interviews. The tricky part is finding someone to help you. Buy them lunch.

# 3.4 Develop a Point of View (POV)

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

Once you have more experience and are looking for more senior roles, going into interviews with your own Point of View or outside-in analysis will be extremely powerful.¬†**Developing a POV document is my secret weapon to stand out against the competition**.

The POV document is a document that contains a piece of analysis or research that you‚Äôve conducted on the company (or function within, or industry) that shows you have a relevant opinion or perspective. The more senior you are, the more important it is to have a view, express your opinion and add value to conversations. Why should an interview be any different?

I‚Äôve used these documents in my past interviews with success. In one instance, as a result of the document, they expanded the role title and job scope offered to me. They were impressed and had confidence that I could take on a bigger role with more responsibilities.

It¬†**showcases your knowledge, experience and ability to form a view**. It shows you can actually think deeply and reflect on a topic. It shows proactiveness. It shows that you‚Äôre different.

There is no easy step-by-step guide for this. I will, however, share a few tips:

* The right length would be about 3-4 slides or pages
* It should be about a trending topic that would highly resonate with the hiring manager
* Make it specific to the company. Leverage the deep dive analysis you have done previously. Gather intel from your networking
* If possible, send it to the hiring manager or interviewer (via HR if needed) a few days before the interview. This allows the interviewer to read it before the interview, which makes it easy for you to bring it up and discuss it during the face-to-face interview. Remember to bring printed out versions into the interview

>**Bonus:** Download a [sample of what a POV document looks like here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-Interview-POV-sample-vShare.pdf). This is a sanitised version of a POV document that I created quite a number of years ago.

Note that this document is more suited for senior or managerial positions. If you‚Äôre a grad, I don‚Äôt recommend doing this.

# 3.5 Preparing questions for the interviewer

Crucially important are the questions you ask during an interview. Most people ask questions like:

>*What do you enjoy most about working in Company A?*

>*How is AI changing the way your company is doing XYZ*

>*What are the skills and behaviours of those who are successful in the role?*

Those are average and boring questions. Instead, ask:

>*Can you tell me a moment of truth through a behaviour or action by a senior leader in Company A that inspired you? (This reveals what the company stands for, how leadership takes ownership, and what type of culture/values the company spreads to its employees)*

>*In what way is your company differentiating itself from competitors when leveraging AI, considering that according to research, 90% of AI implementations in corporate environments has not delivered any value?*

>*What are the strengths of your current team members, and as a result, what are the gaps in skills and experience you are looking for in this role that will be complementary?*

There are also questions to portray that you‚Äôre looking to make an impact, get your hands dirty and are looking to make the hiring manager‚Äôs life easier, such as:

>*How can I ensure that I am involved in the key strategic projects of this company? (Remember this gem?)*

>*What keeps you up at night, and how can this role help you solve these challenges?*

Also, don‚Äôt forget to develop a pointed set of questions which are specific, nuanced and well thought through based on your research and deep dive analysis. Such as:

>*Among the top 3 insurers, by my calculations, your ‚Äúannualised premium agent ratio‚Äù is the lowest according to the most recent annual reports (read out your calculated figures). Based on my analysis, this might be because your commission payout ratio is the lowest amongst the top 3. Is this true, and is your company looking into measures to uplift agent sales productivity?*

The point is, the interviewer will sit up straight and notice that the questions you‚Äôre asking are coming from someone experienced who is asking the right questions and has thought deeply about them. That‚Äôs how you stand out.

Also, many of these deeper and more specific questions may reveal the real culture, ways of working and deeper insights into the company‚Äôs values.

# 3.6 First 90-day plan

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

When you‚Äôre on your final interview (or with the hiring manager), this is where you land the plane. A 90-day plan is a¬†**list of goals that you want to achieve within the first 3 months of the role**¬†(with associated activities to support).

In a previous interview, hopefully you will have asked questions about what is expected of the role, especially in the first 90 days. Use this information to develop a 90-day plan that you can ‚Äúpresent‚Äù back to the hiring manager. This has many benefits:

* **It reinforces your proactiveness**,¬†which is an extremely desirable quality in a candidate. You are ready to start the job. You know how to hit the ground running
* **You can use it to manage expectations and align on the responsibilities of the role.**¬†Present the 90-day plan as a first draft and ask for feedback. Does the hiring manager think there are enough activities and milestones? Does the hiring manager think you need more time to meet stakeholders? You can then further iterate on the plan so you know how to succeed when you start
* **You establish yourself in the hiring manager‚Äôs mind as an employee.**¬†As you discuss and iterate on the plan together, you‚Äôre already collaboratively engaging each other as if you‚Äôre already working together. This gives the hiring manager clarity and the ability to see what it‚Äôs like working with you

When developing a 90-day plan, a few things to keep in mind:

* Always position it as a first draft. You have no idea what it‚Äôs like working there, and by seeking feedback, you position yourself as someone willing to learn, take feedback and a collaborator
* All 90-day plans should have:
   * Meeting team members and stakeholders (so you establish relationships)
   * Some form of orientation/learning
   * Some kind of achievement or small win, with an observable impact. Perhaps it‚Äôs improving the way or working, or a process. Or maybe completing a small project. This shows you can deliver results

Here‚Äôs another sample of what a 90-day plan might look like:

[\[Image placeholder here as can't post images in posts on r/MalaysianPF, click for link to blog\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-6-how-to-find-a-new-job-with-downloadable-templates/)

>**Bonus:** Download the [template to create your own 90-day plan here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Salary-Series_90-day-plan-templates-vShare.pptx)

# 4.0 Getting Offers

If you‚Äôve made it this far, congratulations! You‚Äôve done the hard work, and you can now reap the benefits. If you haven‚Äôt done so already, make sure you read my post on¬†[how to negotiate the salary for your job offer](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-4-how-to-negotiate-a-new-job-offer/).

Once you‚Äôve accepted a job offer, do not forget to politely turn down the other job offers (whilst keeping the connection/relationship open to explore opportunities in the future).

Because you never stop the job search process. Once a job search ends, another new job search takes its place.

# Closing Thoughts

That brings an end to part 6 of my Salary Series. I started this series talking about the¬†[overall labour market and how wages in Malaysia remain stagnant](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-unpacking-the-challenges-in-malaysia/), and over the course of this Salary Series, I gave you deeper and deeper insights and practical advice on negotiating salaries and finding jobs.

So that‚Äôs it for now. This series of posts on salary has been ongoing for many months, and I‚Äôm looking forward to writing about other personal finance topics. There‚Äôs just so much depth to personal finance that I want to write about. But if there‚Äôs a specific topic on salaries/jobs which you want to know more about, let me know.

Not a princess, not a pawn in some arranged marriage , not a pretty daughter paraded out for alliances."," Chapter 1

Fiorella

My father raised me to be a king.

Not a princess, not a pawn in some arranged marriage , not a pretty daughter paraded out for alliances . I was the only child of Alessandro D'Angelo, one the most feared mafia don, and he raised me to be his heir‚Äîhis successor.

I was taught to shoot before I was taught to ride a bicycle. Taught to snap a man's wrist before I was taught to dance. By the age of thirteen, I had learned the names of all the great families and how to kill them best.

He turned me ruthless. He turned me deadly. He turned me unstoppable.

And yet, somehow, I was standing opposite Rocco De Luca‚Äîthe most ruthless man in the underworld‚Äîand he was staring at me as if I were a puzzle he wished to disassemble.

The air was filled with the scent of sweat, blood, and whiskey.

Underground fight clubs existed‚Äîraw, unfiltered, and brutal. The warehouse, dimly lit, was full of it. The horde of men roared as fists landed against flesh, as bones cracked under sadistic force.

I was in the VIP section, watching with detached coolness. I wasn't here to be entertained. I was here on business.

The fight in the ring was almost upon them. One man, a heavily muscled warrior with a crooked nose and blood trickling down his chest, was staggered on his feet. His opponent, a man twice as big as him, was not kind. He landed a body-blowing uppercut, and the other man hit the ground with a hard thud, skull impacting the dirty mat.

The audience cheered.

Pathetic.

The weak did not deserve to live in this world. You learned to fight, or you learned to die. Basic rules, rules that I'd learned as a child.

I shifted my focus from the ring. My prey was in this club somewhere.

Rocco De Luca.

Second son of the De Luca family. The cruelest of the De Luca brothers. A man with no compassion, no doubt, and no conscience.

I'd never seen him before, but I knew the stories.

That he never let enemies live. That his methods of torture were the stuff of legend. That he felt nothing.

He had become even more infamous after his father's death, when Rafael De Luca took over their empire. While Rafael played the strategy game, Rocco played the blood game.

And now I was being compelled to work alongside him.

My dad had made it forcefully plain‚Äîthis union with the De Luca clan was of the utmost importance. A cooperative effort to stamp out a mutual enemy.

Trust, however? That I was in no position to indulge in.

A shift to my left put my senses on high alarm. I stiffened, poised, but didn't reach for the gun buckled at my thigh just yet.

Because I knew him before I'd turned even half the way around.

Rocco De Luca.

He was leaning there, leaning comfortably against the metal railing of my VIP section as though he had the world at his fingertips. The bad lighting cast harsh shadows on his face, and he looked like something cut out of darkness itself.

Black button-down, sleeves rolled up to the elbow, revealing his inked forearms. Strong jawline, dark stubble tracing his chin. And his eyes‚Äîcold, unreadable, dark brown that bordered on black.

The atmosphere between us shifted.

His mouth curled into a smirk that bordered on challenge.

""D'Angelo.""

My hand encircled the glass of whiskey I hadn't been sipping. ""De Luca.""

""You're smaller than I expected you'd be.""

""You're as annoying as I expected you'd be.""

His smirk widened by a fraction. ""I like a woman with bite.""

I scowled at him. ""And I don't like men who waste my time.""

""Shall we get down to business?"" I asked.

I sat back, sipping my whiskey. ""In a hurry?"" he asked.

""Not in the least,"" I said, but there was a glint in my eyes. ""I just like to skip the chit-chat.""

He smirked. ""Too bad. I was looking forward to it.""

There was a flash of something crossing his face‚Äîamusement, interest‚Äîbut it vanished before I could name it.

""Your father hopes that we can work together,"" he mused. ""What do you think?""

""An alliance is convenient for both of us,"" she continued. ""This war that's coming up ahead is not just between small clans‚Äîit's going to catch fire. The smart ones have already aligned themselves.""

""And you'd prefer to be on our side?""

""I'd prefer that we both be on the same one."".

He looked at me. I wasn't wrong. The tension in my world was building. The families that made the bad choices would be buried.

""And what do we get in return?"" He asked.

""Resources. Connections. Power."" I stared him straight in the eye, no blink. ""The question is‚Äîdo you know how to use them?""

He laughed. ""You've got a big mouth on you, don't you?""

His expression didn't change, but I saw the way his fingers twitched , the tightening of his jaw by a fraction.

""Whiskey?"" He asked holding his glass out to me.

I took the unused whiskey and dumped it, as the amber-coloured liquid poured onto the floor in front of and between us.

""I think I'd prefer poison.""

The grin faded. His expression blanked.

Boom.

The entire building shook.

A deafening explosion burst out of the door, creating a shockwave within the club. The explosion hurled bottles off the bar, men stumbling backward. Screams tore through the air as flames and smoke engulfed the exit.

Gunfire. Screams. Pandemonium.

I reached for my gun, reacted before I had even processed the attack.

Bullets tore through skin. Masked men stormed in through the broken doors, rifles cocked. They moved swiftly, precisely‚Äîtrained assassins, not rogue thugs.

One of my guards fell beside me, blood spreading around his head.

I crouched behind the bar, pulse pounding but fingers steady. Rocco was already moving, shooting back without hesitation. His men were behind him, but the ambush was brutal.

My ears rang. Smoke filled my lungs.

I glanced at Rocco.

He was already looking at me.

His expression was empty, but something sharp was in his eyes. Something threatening.

""Can hold your own?"" he shouted over the gunfire.

I gritted my teeth. ""You bet.""

Another shot rocked the ring More dead bodies fell.

The attackers were closing in.

I spun around, pointed my gun, and‚Äî

A bullet tore through my shoulder.

Pain erupted through me.

# Chapter 2

Fiorella

It was the way my father had referred to murder during breakfast, like he had just read yesterday's headlines.

""The De Lucases are ascending,"" he announced, slicing through his steak with a casualness that should have intimidated me. ""And with Lorenzo's murder, they‚Äôve gotten stronger. Nobody believed Rafael would survive the coma, but since he has, they won't stop for anything."".

I shook my espresso, watching the dark liquid froth as I digested his words. ""Lorenzo deserved to die.""

""Of course he did."" My father didn't even look up as he reached for his wine glass. Yes, wine. At breakfast. That was how he started his day‚Äîred meat, black coffee, and a glass of the finest red. Alessandro D'Angelo.

My father.

‚ÄúBut the De Luca brothers are dangerous, Fiorella."" He finally lifted his gaze, dark and unreadable. ""Dangerous than ever before.""

I settled back in my chair, folding one leg over the other. ""And that's making you anxious because‚Ä¶?""

He set his knife down. ""Because the most dangerous thing worse than a dangerous enemy is a more dangerous ally."".

I allowed that to hang there between us, the gravity of his words settling in like a stone.

I had anticipated this conversation. I had seen the way my father's mind had operated over the past few weeks, strategising every move the De Lucases made. From killing Lorenzo, to destroying the foes who had tried to kill Rafael's wife. Even after Rafael had been in a coma, his brother Rocco had torn through their foes mercilessly, with no compassion.

Now Rafael was alive. And conscious. And the De Lucases were way more untouchable than ever.

My father wanted an alliance.

But alliances in this world were created in blood and betrayal. And trusting a De Luca?

That was like doing business with the devil.

""You think they'd attack us?"" I asked.

""I think they'd slit our throats if it ever became convenient for them."" He sipped his wine, eyes glinting above the rim of his glass. ""Which is why we need to make sure they never do.""

My fingers tapped on the porcelain of my coffee cup. ""And how do you propose we do that?""

He smiled, and it wasn't a pleasant smile. ""You.""

The atmosphere shifted.

I stilled. My grip on the cup tightened. ""Me?""

""You're my heir, Fiorella. My successor. You've lived your whole life showing you belong here, that you're something more than a daughter. This is your chance to show it again.""

I released a slow breath, ignoring the way my heart accelerated. ""What do you want me to do?""

""Sit with them. Work with them. Show them we are not enemies, but allies.""

""You expect me to sit with Rocco De Luca and act like I trust the man?""

""I want you to make him trust you first.""

A snort of laughter escaped my lips. ""Rocco De Luca doesn't trust anyone.""

""So you better try to make him.""

I gazed at my father, questioning whether he really believed this was a good idea, or if this was a test of some sort. Because I knew the things about Rocco.

Everyone did.

The second De Luca brother. The enforcer. The one who didn't mind spilling blood.

If Rafael was the face of the De Luca empire, Rocco was its dagger.

A man without conscience or doubt.

""I don't like it,"" I admitted.

""I don't care if you like it,"" my dad said flatly. ""I care if you get it done.""

I clenched my jaw, but I didn't argue. He had set his mind on it.

And so, I had to set mine.

Because moving into the world of De Lucas was moving into a den of lions.

And I wasn't sure if I'd be a hunter‚Ä¶

Or the hunted.

We were having a conversation in his study later in the evening and he mentioned the De Lucas again.

""The De Lucas are getting stronger.""

My father's voice was suave, but I felt the blade below.

I leaned back in my chair, watching him sip his whiskey, every movement calculated. My father never showed his hand, never said anything without thinking it through. He was always a step ahead, always playing the long game.

""Lorenzo's death, the attempt on Rafael's wife‚Ä¶ all that was supposed to shatter them only made them stronger. They destroyed their enemies without hesitation.""

""And now?"" I asked, drumming fingers against my armrest.

""Now, they're unpredictable."" His eyes grew cloudy. ""And that makes them dangerous.""

I breathed slowly, letting the words fall into place. We both knew what he was going to say before he said it because he already mentioned it this morning.

""An alliance.""

""It's the smartest move."" He placed his glass down. ""War is coming, Fiorella. I can feel it in my bones. And when it does, we don't want to be on the wrong side of the battlefield.""

""And if they won't have us?""

A slow smile pulled at his lips. ""Then we help them understand that not having us isn't an option.""

It always had been. Power and strategy, blood and control. A game that I had learned how to play from the age at which I was able to hold a gun.

""Where's the meeting?"" I asked.

""At a club. Neutral territory.""

I smiled. ""There's nothing neutral about the De Lucases.""

""No,"" he agreed. ""But you'll get them to listen.""

""And Rocco?""

His smile spread wider. ""Rocco will be there.""

Of course he would.

The second of the De Luca brothers. The one they whispered about in the backstreets, the one whose very name sent men scattering for shelter.

Rocco was the kind of man who didn't even bother to hide his fangs. He didn't reign like Rafael‚Äîhe devoured. And in contrast to his brother, he didn't need a throne. He was content perched on a pile of dead bodies.

I had never laid eyes on him, but I had encountered him. Seen him across rooms at parties, his shadowy presence on the edge. He talked only as required, never grinned except with a cold, sinister curve.

The kind of man who caused his foes to disappear into thin air.

""Okay,"" I said, standing up. ""I'll go.""

My father looked at me, something enigmatic on his face. Then he nodded. ""Be careful, Fiorella. The De Lucases don't play by the rules.""

I smiled. ""Neither do I.""

# Chapter 3

Rocco

The scent of coffee and freshly baked bread hung in the air, along with something sugary‚Äîmost likely what Rosalia had insisted the chef make. I was seated at the oversized dining table, watching as Rafael poured his wife's coffee as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

It still surprised me.

My brother‚Äîthe same one who shot a man in the head without batting an eye‚Äîwas now the kind of husband who poured coffee for his wife before serving himself.

Rosalia smiled and said something to him that I didn't quite catch, and Rafael responded by leaving a kiss on her temple.

Gross.

""You're making that face again,"" Riccardo told me, smiling as he picked up a piece of bread.

""What face?"" I grumbled.

""The one where you appear to have swallowed glass.""

""Maybe I did.""

Riccardo smiled, shaking his head, but Rafael was blind to us, all focus on his wife.

""Do you need something more, mia rosa?"" he asked her, voice lower than I ever recalled hearing before.

Rosalia glanced up at him, smiling gently in a way that wrapped my stomach in a knot. ""No, I'm fine. But you should eat before your meeting.""

""I will."" He brushed a lock of hair out of her face. ""You should return to bed after breakfast. You were up too late last night.""

Rosalia flushed a little, glancing over at Riccardo and me. ""Rafael‚Äî""

""What?"" He smiled. ""It's the truth.""

Riccardo gagged, stuffing bread into his mouth.

I just sipped my coffee.

This was one version of my brother I was still not used to.

The Rafael I had grown up with was cold, calculating‚Äîa man who ruled with strategy and violence. The Rafael across from me now was still ruthless, still deadly, but he had softened around the edges.

Because of her.

And the craziest part?

He didn't seem to care.

""Anyway,"" Rafael said, finally focusing on me, ""we have business to discuss.""

I set down my coffee. ""I figured.""

""Tonight, you're meeting with Alessandro D'Angelo's daughter.""

That made me curious.

I rocked back in my chair, eyebrow rising. ""Fiorella?""

""Yes.""

I knew the name. Everybody did.

Fiorella D'Angelo wasn't like other mafia girls. She wasn't a prize, a negotiating pawn, or a bride to be wed off for politics. She was her father's heiress‚Äîhis only child of one of the most powerful men of the underworld.

I'd never met her, but rumour had described her vividly enough.

Cold. Ruthless. Intelligent.

A woman who not only sat at the table‚Äîshe ran it.

""What does she want?"" I demanded.

""An alliance.""

I grinned. ""Of course she does.""

Rafael didn't bat an eyelid, just drank his coffee. ""Her father sees what's coming. He knows war is inevitable, and he doesn't want to be on the losing side when it happens.""

""Clever fellow,"" Riccardo growled.

""And what do you want me to do?"" I asked Rafael.

""Get to know her. Check out what she can do for us."" He pinned my gaze, voice authoritative. ""Take the offer if it benefits us. If not‚Äî""

He shrugged.

I picked up the unstated one. If it wasn't going to be worth it, we went.

Or burned the bridge down.

""Okay,"" I said, grabbing my drink.

Rafael nodded, but Rosalia was scrutinising me closely.

""What?"" I asked her.

""Nothing."" She smiled, a little. ""I just wonder if you're underestimating her.""

""I don't underestimate anyone.""

""Good."" She sipped her coffee. ""Because she's not like other women you've met.""

That much, I already knew.

The question was whether or not she'd live up to the hype, or if she'd be a letdown.

Because in my world, reputations rarely panned out that way.

The club was only dimly lit, the air thick with the reek of alcohol and despair.

It was the kind where handshakes sealed deals and were broken by gunfire.

I sat in the quiet booth, whiskey in front of me, back to the wall.

I waited.

For her.

Fiorella D'Angelo.

The so-called queen of her father's empire.

I'd spent the day wondering whether she'd be even remotely the woman people described. The mafia had a reputation for exaggeration‚Äîmaking men monsters, women mythical legends that people couldn't even touch.

Most of the time, that's just what they were‚Äîexaggerated tales.

And then she opened the door.

And I discovered‚Äîfor once‚Äîperhaps the legends would be too little.

She walked along as if she owned the joint, each step calculated, each inch of posture exuding confidence. Black clothes, pulled-back hair, she was sharp enough to cut.

I have done my best to adapt the recipes in a way that for a given coffee, the taste stays fairly consistent from one dripper to the other right after brewing. 



I am very curious to have your opinion on the topic and am interested in seeing what your conclusions are if you replicate the experiment.

# Key takeaways

* Your career profile is not just your CV. Carefully crafting your profile into a clear, compelling narrative and succinct pitch will elevate your success in the job search
* Networking is key to accessing the hidden job market, and it doesn‚Äôt need to be cringey or inauthentic
* Preparing for interviews is more than just thinking about answers to typical interview questions. Extensive research, deep analysis, forming a point of view and aligning on a 90-day plan will help you stand out

# Introduction

Welcome to part 6 of my Salary Series! In my previous post, I discussed the¬†[dynamics of the recruitment marketplace](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). The purpose of that post was to provide you with a deep understanding of how hirers search for and shortlist candidates. In this post, we‚Äôre going to leverage that information to help you succeed in the job search.

From my observations, the average candidate would search and apply for opportunities by:

* Searching for jobs on one, at most two job platforms (JobStreet by SEEK and/or LinkedIn)
* Mass apply for jobs, using one standard CV or a customised CV leveraging AI (which doesn‚Äôt give you an advantage)
* Hope and pray for a response
* Attend interviews with limited research based on browsing the company website

I‚Äôm here to help give you some different meta strategies to elevate your job search game.

Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Disclaimer:**¬†I won‚Äôt be covering basic information that is easily found elsewhere. I‚Äôm going to assume you already know the basics and have the same knowledge and process steps that the ‚Äúaverage candidate‚Äù has.

# Advanced job search strategies

In the job search process, standing out to get the best opportunities and offers requires a lot more effort than you might imagine.. As a result, the job search process starts a lot earlier than you think. There‚Äôs a whole lot of preparation, extensive search and networking, as well as in-depth research to perform for each opportunity.

In each section below, I‚Äôll provide detailed information on what an above-average job-searcher would be doing. I won‚Äôt be covering generic, basic advice that you can easily find (so I expect you know the basics).

# 1.0 Profile Development

The first and most important step in the job search is building up a high-impact, attractive and credible profile. This includes your personal brand, credentials and experience. From day one of your first job, you need to build a strong personal brand, with the right skills, with the right work experience. Of course, these would need to be aligned with your career goals and objectives. Without a strong profile, your job search will be many, many times harder.

Whatever the case, your profile as of now is what it is, and you have to make the best of it.

# 1.1 Detailed CV Knowledge Bank

https://preview.redd.it/wwftp7dq0uuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=00bd546763f51f329dfed6a9a33a748e2b66fe91

The first step I highly recommend is to develop a detailed CV knowledge bank, which is essentially¬†**a database of every single responsibility, initiative and achievement throughout your whole professional career**.

In your typical CV, a single project or achievement is articulated in a single bullet point. In a detailed CV, that one bullet point is expanded to be half a page or even one whole page. The detailed CV may be 20, 30 or even 50 pages long.

Yes, it will take some time. And a lot of effort trying to search for and compile all your past information, data points and feedback from all your past work experience. But it‚Äôs going to be worth it.

# What‚Äôs the purpose of creating such a document?

* You have a central repository of all your work history, achievements and impact
* This allows you to easily and efficiently customise your job application CV by referring to your repository, picking and choosing the most relevant experiences (a lot better than just customising keywords, am I right?)
* It can be used to prepare responses for difficult situational or behavioural interview questions. By writing it down in extreme, explicit detail, you gain clarity and specificity in the answers that you would have rehearsed
* You can go even deeper with the hirer if requested. There was one opportunity where I was asked for more specific information (on top of my CV) about my experience in Corporate Strategy work. I ended up submitting a 10+ slide deck with all the relevant Corporate Strategy experience extracted from my detailed CV. Easy peasy

>**BONUS:** Download a [sample of the Detailed CV Knowledge Bank here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-sample-vShare.pdf). Also, I've made available a [Detailed CV Knowledge Bank template](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Detailed-CV-Knowledge-Bank-template-vShare.pptx) you can download and use

This tool is not going to be useful unless you write down every piece of work you have done in great detail, including quantitative data points, as well as measurable outcomes, as a result of what you have done. You need to write down information such as ‚ÄúFacilitated 4 workshops comprising 75 stakeholders in total, leading to the identification and prioritisation of 150 requirements/user stories.‚Äù

It‚Äôs going to be A LOT of work trawling your whole email archive, shared folders, old CVs, etc., to find and consolidate all the information from your work history. However, future updates will be relatively quick, say 30-60 minutes every quarter.

# 1.2 Career strategy, narrative and elevator pitch

Now that you have compiled your detailed CV, you have built an extensive view of your whole career. It will give you the clarity and foundation to help formulate your vision for your career.

That‚Äôs the next step before performing a job search. Being clear on the career you want, which translates into your career strategy, what pathway you want to take, as well as what you need to do to get there. Your career strategy and pathway give you focus on the types of jobs, industries and companies you should target in your job search.

Which then leads to formulating your profile narrative and elevator pitch.

**The narrative**¬†of your career experience and where it‚Äôs headed. It‚Äôs a compelling story that articulates what you‚Äôve done, why you‚Äôve made certain decisions and what you may aim to do in the future. For example, my narrative is:

>I started out the first 10 years of my career in stockbroking and wealth management in one company, where I was given new opportunities and promotions almost every 2 years due to my ability to deliver results

>Towards the end of those 10 years, I realised that whilst I had great vertical progression, I only had experience in one division, of one company, in one industry my whole career.

>I realised that it was important for my career development to gain a breadth of exposure across many different functions, divisions and companies. That‚Äôs when I decided to pivot into consulting, which would provide that breadth of exposure in a compressed timeframe. Hence, I joined an MBA program that would allow me to exit into consulting

>I also decided to work in Asia, to gain exposure into a different environment and working culture.

>Since the MBA, I have spent another 10 years across two consulting firms and headed up strategy at an investment bank, where I gained significant experience in a broad range of functions and types of financial services firms

>As a next step in my career, I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to consolidate my wealth of experiences in leadership skills into a position that has high visibility and high impact as a senior executive

**Your elevator pitch**¬†is a 30-second summary of your profile and narrative that makes you a unique and highly sought-after candidate. The elevator pitch is something you use when you introduce yourself to a new connection or an interviewer when faced with the ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù question. It needs to be succinct, specific, yet punchy. An example, based on the narrative above, would be:

>*Across my career, I‚Äôve built a unique balance of depth and breadth having both industry and consulting experience. I started as a skilled operator across client management, product management and partnerships in wealth management, where I delivered consistent results and rose rapidly through the ranks. Later, I broadened my perspective through consulting and strategy leadership roles across multiple financial institutions and markets in Asia. What ties it all together after almost 20 years is my ability to navigate complexity, drive clarity, and lead teams to deliver impact. At this stage, I‚Äôm focused on bringing that full spectrum of experience into a senior executive role that allows me to shape strategy and deliver measurable outcomes at scale.*

# 1.3 Online profiles (LinkedIn, Jobstreet, GitHub, etc)

If you don‚Äôt have¬†[LinkedIn¬†](https://www.linkedin.com/)and¬†[Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/)¬†accounts, you‚Äôre limiting your visibility with hirers. Without setting up accounts on these job platforms, you won‚Äôt have an online profile that showcases your professional work experience. Without an online profile, how do you think hirers can find you when they are performing proactive searches for candidates?

Hirers and especially recruiters use these platforms to find matching candidates. As someone who has a complete profile which showcases that I work for top firms with impactful experience, I often get messages and invitations from hirers and recruiters to explore opportunities that they have.

Also, don‚Äôt limit yourself to just¬†[LinkedIn¬†](https://www.linkedin.com/)and¬†[Jobstreet by SEEK](https://jobstreet.com/). You should be building your profile in places where people in your industry congregate. For example, if you‚Äôre a software engineer, you should be showcasing your work on¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/).

# 2.0 Pipeline Development

The next step is to start building your pipeline of opportunities. Don‚Äôt forget about the¬†[hidden job market when searching for opportunities](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/). You‚Äôll need to track and manage this pipeline through a single process using a single workflow.

# 2.1 Pipeline Management Tool

First of all, you need a pipeline management tool. It‚Äôs a document or file that you can keep track of the job search process, and note down all opportunities you have and manage each opportunity‚Äôs status.

Here‚Äôs a screenshot of what that might look like:

https://preview.redd.it/hq1lmuzf1uuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=41c360f18b12ad920d696ad0515541b07d57b17f

You will want to have two sheets in your spreadsheet:

1. **Company list:**¬†A worksheet with a list of companies you are targeting to find opportunities; and
2. **Opportunity list:**¬†A worksheet with a list of identified job opportunities

>**Bonus**: Download a [copy of the template here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx) for your own use

Let me explain how you should update the two lists:

**Company list**

If you‚Äôve ever read the¬†[2-hour job search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/), skip this section. You already know what to do here. I think it‚Äôs a great and highly effective method to not only focus your efforts, but also develop your network.

The very quick summary is as follows:

* List as many companies as you would like to work for. This should take just 10-15 minutes tops
* Do online research to identify companies which are similar to the companies you wrote down on your list. Examples of how to do this:
   * Use the LinkedIn search function with the names of your companies in the list, and use the ‚Äúfind similar‚Äù function. This will help you find other companies which you might want to explore
   * Search by industry/function and browse job listings, look out for companies which you haven‚Äôt heard of and research them
* Map out any connections/networks you know who are currently or previously working in these companies. Use LinkedIn and your contact list. Mark that down in your list
* Score the company list using the instructions I provided in the tool (e.g. look on JobStreet by SEEK and LinkedIn for job ads by that company for ‚ÄúPosting‚Äù score)
* Rank (or rather, sort) the list so the highest score with a potential connection appears at the top of the list

This will result in a list of companies to focus your efforts on, penetrating the¬†[hidden job market](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-5-understanding-the-employment-marketplace/)¬†using networks and connections

**Opportunity List**

I list all opportunities in this sheet, even if they‚Äôre not on my Company List sheet. More instructions are¬†[inside the downloadable tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx).

How do I go about searching for opportunities and populating this sheet?

* **Proactive search:**¬†Whenever a recruiter approaches you with an opportunity you might be interested in, record it down
* **Networking:**¬†Whenever someone you have a coffee catch-up or an¬†[informational interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_interview)¬†with offers a referral or highlights an opening, record it down
* **Job advertisement search:**¬†The average person uses one, maybe two job portals at most to do their job search. Don‚Äôt be average. I do a ‚Äútotal market scan‚Äù because I‚Äôm a maximiser. Let‚Äôs say I want to find a job in Financial Services (Banks, Insurers, Wealth Management, etc).
   * I would search using:
      * Large job portals:¬†[JobStreet by SEEK](https://www.jobstreet.com/),¬†[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), and¬†[Indeed](http://indeed.com/).
      * Specialised job boards:¬†[eFinancialCareers](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/)
      * Company careers page: That company list you created? Visit the careers section for every one of them
      * Recruiters: Michael Page / Page Executive, Robert Walters, Hays, Ambition, Ranstad, etc.
   * That list should amount to 50-60 websites you‚Äôre searching for job opportunities at any one time. Rinse and repeat. Every day for large job portals. The others, weekly.

50 ‚Äì 60 websites for a job search may seem excessive. But you want to make sure you¬†**identify every single relevant opportunity**. Here‚Äôs what you do:

* For large portals, you can save your search criteria so you don‚Äôt have to set it up each time.
* Always ensure you sort the search results from the most recent job ad to the oldest
* Copy into¬†[the tool](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-search-pipeline-tool-vShare.xlsx)¬†all the opportunities you‚Äôre interested in
* The first time you do this, it may take a few hours (or 1-2 days) to go through every single search result over the past couple of weeks
* But once you‚Äôre done with the backlog, if you‚Äôre searching the large portals every day, you only need to scroll through one day‚Äôs worth of new job advertisements based on your search criteria. For each large job portal, that might be just 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes. And the rest of the websites you‚Äôll do weekly, that might be an hour or so once a week

# 2.2 Tapping the hidden job market

Now that we have our pipeline, we need to start focusing on the hidden job market. No point applying for job ads, then sit back and watch Netflix whilst waiting for responses. Time to ensure we get a hold of the best opportunities.

**Proactive search**

If you‚Äôve done your online profiles right (It‚Äôs only taken many, many years of hard work and achievements to build your profile, and just 60 minutes to condense it online), the proactive search opportunities will start coming.

There‚Äôs a lot of information online on how to make your online profile attractive, so I won‚Äôt cover that. Some other important advice:

* Always keep your profile up to date, even when you‚Äôre not job hunting. The more up-to-date the information, the more information the hirer has about you
* Be active. Even if that‚Äôs casually browsing, commenting or liking posts. These platforms inform hirers and recruiters of user behaviour, such as when you‚Äôre browsing job ads, when you‚Äôre reading their company posts, etc. These are strong interest signals
* Instead, show activity on job platforms. Follow companies. Post POVs. Comment, like. Recruiters can see your high-level activity on these platforms. You want to portray yourself as ‚Äúcasually browsing‚Äù, not ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù, which can be a sign of desperation
* Do not put open to work. Unfortunately, there is a hidden stigma around candidates who have their profile as ‚Äúopen to work‚Äù.

**Networking**

Most people have negative perceptions of networking. It‚Äôs cringe. It‚Äôs slimy and inauthentic. It‚Äôs a lot of chest beating and schmoozing.

That‚Äôs what TV shows and inexperienced people tell you about networking.

Most (effective) networking is NOT about turning up to a conference, shaking hands with strangers and exchanging business cards.

The best networkers¬†**grow their network organically and give back more than they receive**. Let me explain.

Ever heard of¬†[six degrees of separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation)? Whilst it may be inaccurate to some degree, the premise can still hold. Why try blind luck in trying to meet others, when your closest connections (friends, family, colleagues) could introduce you to new connections? And when you build a relationship with the new connections, they could potentially introduce you to a whole new degree of connections.

Some tips and tricks to help (because I can write a whole new post about networking):

* **You will always have different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of connections in your network.**¬†You have a close inner circle, a warm network, and a not-so-warm (cold) network. How often you engage with them depends on the level
* **Always be curious and helpful.**¬†When building relationships, be genuinely curious about their perspective, insights and experiences.
* **Give back as much as possible.**¬†Offer to help others without expecting anything in return. Read the book¬†[Give and Take by Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net/book/give-and-take/).
* **The best networkers help connect others.**¬†Have a friend in banking who wants to create a fintech startup and wants to learn from a developer? If you know a rockstar developer, connect them
* **Ask to be connected.**¬†Reach out and ask your connections if they know anyone employed in companies on your preferred list, or even generally if they know anyone in that industry or job function that they could connect you to for an informational interview. Rinse and repeat
* **Build and constantly update a networking list.**¬†This may sound weird. Some networkers swear by it. Some don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs a list of your connections, with relevant notes. Most useful information to keep:
   * Profile/background
   * When you last met/talked to them
   * What you‚Äôve talked about and what they have done for you
   * What you have done for them (so you make sure you always do more for others)
   * Interesting information that helps remember who they are and what‚Äôs important to them

To be more specific in the job search context, I think of networking in two general categories:

* **Company-specific networking**
   * Based on the companies you do want to work for, reach out to people who work in these companies to do informational interviews. Sometimes these may be a cold message on LinkedIn or email (reach the¬†[2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/)¬†on how to do this)
   * If you are looking at an opportunity in a different team, ask for a connection referral to meet someone in that team
   * If you don‚Äôt know anyone in that company, use LinkedIn to find second-degree connections, meaning someone who knows someone who works in that company. Ask for a connection referral
* **Industry-wide networking**
   * Connect with others in your network who are in the industry (again,¬†[2-hour Job Search](https://2hourjobsearch.com/))
   * Ask to be connected with others, say you‚Äôre looking to explore opportunities across the industry

# 3.0 Interview preparation

Now that you‚Äôre getting opportunities in the pipeline, you‚Äôll need to start focusing on preparing for upcoming interviews.¬† It‚Äôs more than just thinking about the answers to a few questions and watching a few YouTube videos on how to answer generic interview questions.

# 3.1 Background research

On top of the usual background research, such as browsing the company‚Äôs website and annual reports to understand how the business works, its history, scope, mission and vision, etc., you should be going deeper and more specific into your functional area.

Additional avenues of research are:

* Connections within your network who currently or have previously worked in the company
* Glassdoor and similar websites to understand the general employee sentiment, what people think about the culture, ways of working, etc.
* Interviews, news articles and podcasts from company leaders, especially those that are from your functional area of the organisation. This helps you understand how they think, the challenges that they‚Äôre trying to solve, trends they are monitoring, and what their priorities are
* GenAI / LLMs now offer deep research capabilities. Use this to your advantage
* Analyst reports if the company you‚Äôre interviewing for is publicly listed
* Industry publications and reports for wider information about the market they‚Äôre in

# 3.2 Deep dive analysis

**Analysis is different from research**. Research is gathering information. Analysis is interpreting the data to gain insights that will help you gain a deeper understanding and your point of view on the company

Overall, you‚Äôll want to understand the key trends and challenges the company is facing, its strategy, and how this affects the role and the team that you‚Äôre interviewing for.

Examples of analysis that you could conduct:

* **Competitive analysis:**¬†If the role you‚Äôre applying for is a strategic, commercial or similar role where understanding the competitive landscape is important, you‚Äôll want to understand the competitive environment. Market shares, competitive advantages, points of differentiation, competitive responses, etc.
* **Sales productivity:**¬†Understanding the productivity of the sales / frontline team. If you‚Äôre interviewing for a sales leader role, you could analyse and benchmark how productive the sales force is versus competitors (e.g. revenue per sales headcount, revenue per branch, etc)
* **Product deployment velocity:**¬†If you‚Äôre interviewing for a product manager or software engineer role, you could analyse the ‚Äúchangelog‚Äù for a mobile app, feature announcements, etc., and map a timeline of new features and product announcements over time. You can then also compare that to product/tech headcount or expenses, in addition to increases in capital expenditures for new technologies, to uncover insights into how effective they are in deploying human and financial capital to develop new products, as well as how fast their product development cycle is and how it has changed over time.

The types of analysis you could do have no bounds. It really depends on the type of role you‚Äôre applying for. You just need to spend some time thinking about what would be a meaningful analysis that you can then extend into great probing questions to ask, or into your point of view on how to solve those challenges you have uncovered from your analysis.

If possible, do try to validate some of your analysis with anyone in your network that is in a position to do so (without breaching any confidentiality or divulging private company information).

# 3.3 Preparing for interview questions

Now that you have an in-depth view of the company, the function and role you‚Äôre applying for, the next step is to prepare responses to questions that may be asked in the interviews.

There‚Äôs a mountain of information online about this, so I‚Äôll cover the most important principles to elevate how you respond to interview questions:

* Develop a response bank for interview questions. Write‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶ down. No excuses. Don‚Äôt think about the responses in your head and assume you‚Äôve prepared. Word document, Excel, PowerPoint, or physical notebook. Doesn‚Äôt matter. This is mandatory, so don‚Äôt skip it
* Use the research and deep dive analysis you have conducted to formulate responses that are specific, deep and insightful (if this applies to any of the questions)
* The best overall strategy is to ‚Äústeer‚Äù your answers to reinforce your elevator pitch and career narrative. This paints a congruent profile that showcases you as the strongest candidate.
   * If your elevator pitch is that you‚Äôre the best deal closer for Enterprise Sales, design the interview responses accordingly. For example, when asked a question ‚Äúhow do you deal with conflict?‚Äù, you could use a story of how your pre-sales consultant angered a potential new client, but you managed to resolve the conflict, which led to the client signing a deal with you.
* Practice your responses out loud in front of a mirror. Even better, record your practice sessions and watch them. The best communicators do this as part of presentation preparation
* Do live interview practice with a partner. This is the closest and best way to prepare for real interviews. The tricky part is finding someone to help you. Buy them lunch.

# 3.4 Develop a Point of View (POV)

https://preview.redd.it/1p6q37di1uuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3988cdd8a415ba9d3285c74e4fa9df1771cfda5

Once you have more experience and are looking for more senior roles, going into interviews with your own Point of View or outside-in analysis will be extremely powerful.¬†**Developing a POV document is my secret weapon to stand out against the competition**.

The POV document is a document that contains a piece of analysis or research that you‚Äôve conducted on the company (or function within, or industry) that shows you have a relevant opinion or perspective. The more senior you are, the more important it is to have a view, express your opinion and add value to conversations. Why should an interview be any different?

I‚Äôve used these documents in my past interviews with success. In one instance, as a result of the document, they expanded the role title and job scope offered to me. They were impressed and had confidence that I could take on a bigger role with more responsibilities.

It¬†**showcases your knowledge, experience and ability to form a view**. It shows you can actually think deeply and reflect on a topic. It shows proactiveness. It shows that you‚Äôre different.

There is no easy step-by-step guide for this. I will, however, share a few tips:

* The right length would be about 3-4 slides or pages
* It should be about a trending topic that would highly resonate with the hiring manager
* Make it specific to the company. Leverage the deep dive analysis you have done previously. Gather intel from your networking
* If possible, send it to the hiring manager or interviewer (via HR if needed) a few days before the interview. This allows the interviewer to read it before the interview, which makes it easy for you to bring it up and discuss it during the face-to-face interview. Remember to bring printed out versions into the interview

>**Bonus:** Download a [sample of what a POV document looks like here](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TWM-Job-Interview-POV-sample-vShare.pdf). This is a sanitised version of a POV document that I created quite a number of years ago.

Note that this document is more suited for senior or managerial positions. If you‚Äôre a grad, I don‚Äôt recommend doing this.

# 3.5 Preparing questions for the interviewer

Crucially important are the questions you ask during an interview. Most people ask questions like:

>*What do you enjoy most about working in Company A?*

>*How is AI changing the way your company is doing XYZ*

>*What are the skills and behaviours of those who are successful in the role?*

Those are average and boring questions. Instead, ask:

>*Can you tell me a moment of truth through a behaviour or action by a senior leader in Company A that inspired you? (This reveals what the company stands for, how leadership takes ownership, and what type of culture/values the company spreads to its employees)*

>*In what way is your company differentiating itself from competitors when leveraging AI, considering that according to research, 90% of AI implementations in corporate environments has not delivered any value?*

>*What are the strengths of your current team members, and as a result, what are the gaps in skills and experience you are looking for in this role that will be complementary?*

There are also questions to portray that you‚Äôre looking to make an impact, get your hands dirty and are looking to make the hiring manager‚Äôs life easier, such as:

>*How can I ensure that I am involved in the key strategic projects of this company? (Remember this gem?)*

>*What keeps you up at night, and how can this role help you solve these challenges?*

Also, don‚Äôt forget to develop a pointed set of questions which are specific, nuanced and well thought through based on your research and deep dive analysis. Such as:

>*Among the top 3 insurers, by my calculations, your ‚Äúannualised premium agent ratio‚Äù is the lowest according to the most recent annual reports (read out your calculated figures). Based on my analysis, this might be because your commission payout ratio is the lowest amongst the top 3. Is this true, and is your company looking into measures to uplift agent sales productivity?*

The point is, the interviewer will sit up straight and notice that the questions you‚Äôre asking are coming from someone experienced who is asking the right questions and has thought deeply about them. That‚Äôs how you stand out.

Also, many of these deeper and more specific questions may reveal the real culture, ways of working and deeper insights into the company‚Äôs values.

# 3.6 First 90-day plan

https://preview.redd.it/9u54fugj1uuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c04a75f329f1c74f9943b36314ee6f362c78cc7f

When you‚Äôre on your final interview (or with the hiring manager), this is where you land the plane. A 90-day plan is a¬†**list of goals that you want to achieve within the first 3 months of the role**¬†(with associated activities to support).

In a previous interview, hopefully you will have asked questions about what is expected of the role, especially in the first 90 days. Use this information to develop a 90-day plan that you can ‚Äúpresent‚Äù back to the hiring manager. This has many benefits:

* **It reinforces your proactiveness**,¬†which is an extremely desirable quality in a candidate. You are ready to start the job. You know how to hit the ground running
* **You can use it to manage expectations and align on the responsibilities of the role.**¬†Present the 90-day plan as a first draft and ask for feedback. Does the hiring manager think there are enough activities and milestones? Does the hiring manager think you need more time to meet stakeholders? You can then further iterate on the plan so you know how to succeed when you start
* **You establish yourself in the hiring manager‚Äôs mind as an employee.**¬†As you discuss and iterate on the plan together, you‚Äôre already collaboratively engaging each other as if you‚Äôre already working together. This gives the hiring manager clarity and the ability to see what it‚Äôs like working with you

When developing a 90-day plan, a few things to keep in mind:

* Always position it as a first draft. You have no idea what it‚Äôs like working there, and by seeking feedback, you position yourself as someone willing to learn, take feedback and a collaborator
* All 90-day plans should have:
   * Meeting team members and stakeholders (so you establish relationships)
   * Some form of orientation/learning
   * Some kind of achievement or small win, with an observable impact. Perhaps it‚Äôs improving the way or working, or a process. Or maybe completing a small project. This shows you can deliver results

Here‚Äôs another sample of what a 90-day plan might look like:

https://preview.redd.it/ms1ywggk1uuf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3605488cdd7d9616334b61c576116742e0e682c2

# 4.0 Getting Offers

If you‚Äôve made it this far, congratulations! You‚Äôve done the hard work, and you can now reap the benefits. If you haven‚Äôt done so already, make sure you read my post on¬†[how to negotiate the salary for your job offer](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-4-how-to-negotiate-a-new-job-offer/).

Once you‚Äôve accepted a job offer, do not forget to politely turn down the other job offers (whilst keeping the connection/relationship open to explore opportunities in the future).

Because you never stop the job search process. Once a job search ends, another new job search takes its place.

# Closing Thoughts

That brings an end to part 6 of my Salary Series. I started this series talking about the¬†[overall labour market and how wages in Malaysia remain stagnant](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-unpacking-the-challenges-in-malaysia/), and over the course of this Salary Series, I gave you deeper and deeper insights and practical advice on negotiating salaries and finding jobs.

So that‚Äôs it for now. This series of posts on salary has been ongoing for many months, and I‚Äôm looking forward to writing about other personal finance topics. There‚Äôs just so much depth to personal finance that I want to write about. But if there‚Äôs a specific topic on salaries/jobs which you want to know more about, let me know.

The whole thing started with that I got a voucher to get a not-known brand entry level semi automatic espresso machine for free. This reminds me that I did enjoy my partner's delonghi original magnifica whenever I use it at his place. So now I am in the situation having to choose:

1. A Free non-known brand entry level semi automatic (it says 20 bar 1350w if it helps). But then I will get a coffee bean grinder and learn how to use the machine etc. I know there would be a learning curve.
2. I found an original magnifica in my area, official refurnished (if still there), for around 262USD.
3. I found a new Magnifica S (not start, but the one before that), for around 326 USD.

Now I am confused. I think I want the convenience of the automatic, but will magnifica s 50 USD better than original? If I don't want to spend money at all, I could get that semi auto for free, but then I guess the grinder cost as much or as little as I want.

I‚Äôm 23F and currently on my second gap year. For some reason, I‚Äôm tired all the time. Like, to the point where around 4 p.m. I get so sleepy I have to take a nap, otherwise I can‚Äôt function. But then when it‚Äôs time to go to bed at night, I‚Äôm suddenly not tired anymore.
I don‚Äôt really get it ‚Äî I usually sleep 8‚Äì9 hours a night, I spend time outside in the sun, I don‚Äôt drink coffee or energy drinks, I don‚Äôt drink and smoke, and I exercise 3‚Äì4 times a week (though I‚Äôll admit my diet could be better).
Could it be because I go to bed around midnight and wake up around 9 a.m.? Last winter, when I had a job that required me to wake up at 7 a.m. and go to bed around 9 p.m., I still needed a nap after work ‚Äî but that job was pretty physically demanding, so I thought that explained it.
Now I don‚Äôt have a job, I just help around the house, but I still feel completely drained. It‚Äôs starting to affect my motivation ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even have the energy to exercise anymore, even though running usually helps me regulate my emotions and keeps me grounded. Without it, I feel worse.

1o5d44l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5d44l,What's causing my teeth to be so yellow?,"I've had this struggle for at least ten years. I'm 23 and ever since I was 13 I've been getting comments on my ""neon yellow"" or brown teeth. I'm not from the States, so perfectly white and straight teeth aren't the norm here, I just feel like I'm really unlucky when it comes to my teeth. I've never seen anyone else my age have their teeth be naturally this yellow.

The thing is, I have a paternal twin and his teeth have always been really nice and white in colour and our diet has always been the same. I've never drunk anything too staining, not tea, not coffee, can't stand red wine. 

At maybe 15 a dentist told me I have some mild enamel erosion going on. I was told it was caused by citrus fruits and berries my parents made me eat multiple times a day, and since I've cut most of them out of my diet. I've never liked sodas or energy drinks, so I've never regularly drunk them. No one has mentioned anything about erosion to me ever since, apart from asking me about my diet before check-ups, and the last time I had a check-up a year ago they left a note in my health data saying ""Erosion: none"". 

I've never smoked regularly, and when I did smoke maybe half a cigarette every week for a few months in 2021 I didn't notice any changes in my teeth. The twin I mentioned earlier used to smoke a pack a day for a few years and also never got any staining. 

My oral hygiene is good, I'd say, I brush at least two times a day with an electric tootbrush, floss once at night and also use a silicone pick. However as you can see I build tartar between my lower front teeth really fast, I had a deep clean a year ago and I started noticing it building up three weeks after. I'm really frustrated and embarrassed by it, and honestly sometimes feel very hopeless. It's not caused gingivitis or sensitivity this year, but it's making me crazy. The dentist recommended me to go see a hygienist every two years, but I honestly feel like I need to go to one every six months. I do get gingivitis a lot, my POB was at 15%. I believe it's somewhat genetic, since the people in my family tend to have dry mouth and my father (though he is also a chain-smoker) has periodontal disease and has lost all his teeth.

The worst pictures I have of my teeth are the ones taken with a flashlight. They look really dull and really dark yellow with a gray outline. I won't even post them since I find them so disgusting.

I just don't know what to do. Crest whitening strips are illegal here, so I could only go to a private clinic to get my teeth whitened, but I don't know what would be the best option and if the results would even last for longer than a week. ",2,1760340169.0,askdentists,3,1.0,False

I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to this sub and all the friends I made here who have helped me in the last one year. I have divided this post into little backstory (finding loa, Neville and realizing why law is indeed real), 
My learnings,My Successes, and techniques used.

Backstory: I am 27, right now and for almost twelve years of my life I have been ridden with depression, felt lonely and isolated, was victim to my circumstances because of it. 
Three years ago, I moved to EU from my home country and experienced horrible health crisis, went bankrupt, failed my exams, broke up with my man whom I dated for almost six years and was just practically alone and secluded in my room, suicidal for seven months (all of this happened in 2023 simultaneously). 

For first half of 2024, I was simply putting out fires and in therapy, until my man told me there is someone else now and I failed my finals proceeding with me getting kicked out of my program. I wanted to be a writer and during those days I came really close to publishing my poetry collection and even paid deposit to a publication but it turned out to be fraud and I lost money and my heart was crushed.

I was completely lost. I believed when I was 13 that I am going to be successful, loved and happy in my adulthood and I was completely lost and losing it in my mid 20s already despite living half of my dream of living abroad. 

This was it. 
This was the point wherein I decided this is not the life I want to live.
Things got to change. 


On the same day (17 July 2024, yes I remember the day!), I looked into Manifestation sub, followed by Law of Attraction then Assumption, then Neville Goddard. I got into teachings of Joe Dispenza, Sammy Ingram, Erik (Power of I am) and most importantly I started reading Bhagvad Gita. 


My Learnings: 

Many people who come on this sub for most part come to manifest something which THEY BELIEVE IS OUTSIDE OF THEM. 
this is the key to it all - the Belief that it is outside of you. 

One of the early most post I read  in Law of Assumption or its application was to 
1. Identify your wounds/triggers. IDENTIFY. 
Identity to know what you believe yourself in the moment, to what you reveal about yourself. 
It's important because it shows you exactly where the north of your compass is. 

‚ÄúChange your conception of yourself and you will automatically change the world in which you live. Do not try to change people; they are only messengers telling you who you are.‚Äù ‚Äî Neville Goddard


2. For the first two months, I simply understood and recognise all my negative thoughts and beliefs and worked heavily on my self concept. I created a story , a small scene of talking to a friend on how to heal depression. It maybe similar to Visualization or Scripting but tbh, i didn't do it perfectly but I just did. Key was my own belief that I am someone who can give advice on it and people will believe me because they see the change in me. Meaning i have changed. 

‚ÄúAssume the feeling of your wish fulfilled and continue feeling it until that which you feel objectifies itself.‚Äù ‚Äî Neville Goddard, Feeling is the Secret.

For all the, which technique wonderers - IT TRULY DOESN'T MATTER. it boils down to you and your belief. Your story. The medium of the story is irrelevant. Only the story is. And story can change per the will of the writer, any time, any day.

3. In 2025, I experienced a lot of 3d setbacks within first three months was even more lost. My visa was ending and I was struggling physically this time. I revised all I learned but I go into the nitty gritty beyond the 3d and our desires aspect through Gita. 

I want to emphasize, I have read Bible and few texts from other religious texts, I am from Science background and I believe in God but I also question it's existence and existence of Universe itself but honestly from everything I have read  and studied it all points to the concrete fact that Life comes from us. We give it meaning. Because in truth Life is meaningless, random, and nothingness. 

It's our own thoughts, ego, mind, beliefs, senses which create a picture. As without, so within, so without, so within...its endless.

And Gita, primarily, made me realize that a man is bound to his ego, which binds our thoughts and knowledge, which binds our beliefs and which binds our senses and which shows in 3d. That's all. Once we see beyond our ego. We realize there exists an observer beyond ego. We see god. And we are god. 
And if you look at it scientifically, we all come from atoms. So we are creation of the same unit. You, world around you, your desires are atoms and part of the same mixture as you. 

‚ÄúYou are already that which you want to be, and your refusal to believe it is the only reason you do not see it.‚Äù ‚Äî Neville Goddard

There is nothing away from you.
It's a belief which took months to get rooted in my belief. But it's a truth I return to now every time.

Also, truth of detachment. Detachment is not being unbothered or ignoring or pretending to not care. Detachment is freeing yourself. It is freedom from everything we allow to govern us. Meaning freedom from your desire. The desperation the need the reason of wanting it ceases to exist because you're not trapped by your senses anymore.

It is or it is not but you are . And if you are ,so it it is.

All this learnings led me to my successes:
1. Within starting in 2023, my therapy improved. I made few new friends and I became someone who admired Nature. I became calmer within weeks. Around two months in, one of my friends told me that it feels so much calmer to be around me now. A week later, a friend I hadn't talked to and ended on bad terms with reached out after four years and we reconciled and became best friends again in a month. 
My scene of explaining how depression works and how to heal came true thrice with three different friends.

2. I affirmed that things work out for me as my umbrella Affirmations. And over time. My father's business boomed in early 2024 and he lend me money to pay my debt. It was a huge amount and medical bill. But I received money from my friends as a contest prize for my writing as well.

3. I was lost and in a dead end career for years. And felt shameful of my career which contributed to my failure in masters program. A month before failing I attended a conference on machine learning and it's application in medical fields especially mental health and women endocrine systems and I was thrilled and found my purpose. I looked into it and started studying.

Even after dropping out, I continued to apply for jobs and received two internship. Even now a job in my home country, paying me 5 figure a month and admission to a masters program in my dream city to restart studies this time in a field I am seeing my future in and am more aligned with. 

4. I had given up on writing but I started writing again after 10 months on Substack and now I have over 500 subscribers and millions of ideas to write more and more. I recently acquired an agent as well 

5. My relationship with my man is improving. I realized everything was created by me. We haven't reconciled yet. But yesterday, I found out he broke up. I also realized he is my mirror. Probably the most accurate one. I retraced my memories as I changed my beliefs and I saw him reflect them every time we talked. When we had a conversation last time, I did so to gain closure and to free him to be happy with whomever (it was a bad day ngl). But he proceeded to tell me that he knows this isn't the last time we are talking and our paths will cross once more... and while our paths haven't crossed yet, I know it is going to.

6. My relationship with myself improved. I don't remember being depressed, anxious or anything ever. I get complimented by my people and everyone tells me they admire me so much. I hated sports all my life but now I not only go to gym daily but I am training as a boxer. I live my life as of a boxer with discipline and courage. And this is a big one because, my relationship with food was one which caused me a lot of pain since my school life. I was bullied then over my weight. 

And my refusal to be that trapped girl is what making me work hard and be proud everyday. I learnt about human body and am losing fat and gaining strength and command over my body each day. 

My life took a 175 in an year. 175 because I know there's more to come haha.

Lastly, my techniques:

 Learning what manifesting, life, Neville's lectures especially Faith is fortune, Gita and everything I mentioned. All of them contributed. But personally, understanding what life is? That question opened avenues to appreciate life in small and big ways.

My ultimate fav - ‚ÄúFaith is loyalty to the unseen reality.‚Äù ‚Äî Neville Goddard, Faith is Your Fortune

But practically, 
1. Affirmations, 3-4 personal ones. Short like I am chosen. I am safe. I am grateful. As well as 2-3 umbrella like Everything works out for me. I am all that is. 
During the beginning, I affirmed with a timer thrice a day for ten minutes. I said them out loud.

2. Tapes - I created desires affs tapes. Basically, a. miracles and I recorded myself saying I received it all. My life is magic etc. and then played it all night while sleeping. I created several such each of 2-3 minutes and put it on loop...
Subconscious conditioning is magic. I woke up feeling a different person several times in these years. Almost forgetting what was.

3. Scripting/Visualizing when I am not desperate or want to change 3d. I used to script or imagine when i saw something unpleasant. This emphasized the lack and my need to fill it. So I stopped that. I only script and visualise when I suddenly miss sp or wondered what am I gonna do or be in two three months and I script something inconsequential.

Before receiving a call back for my internship I imagined wearing formals in the mirror before sleeping. Next morning I saw the same shirt on my shopping app and I added to cart and debated buying when I haven't received any offer. But I still did for fun of it all. And an hour later I got the offer letter.
With my bf, I wondered him teasing me that I have a gym trainer when he could be mine too. And it's one of my favourite scenes to think of him.

Don't be heavy on the how and write endless stories. Rather focus on being the character in that story. 

4. Lastly, returning to basics in doubt I have a playlist of all my favourite manifestation videos I watch them as often. I feel grateful every day, even on my shittiest day which makes me appreciate as small as a pretty leaf or even a bad coffee on days. I live my life and meaning I am thrilled by life and what all there is to discover and learn. When I say, I read it all and come to the same truth of what life is, I mean it and you can find it for yourself too.

‚ÄúDare to believe in the reality of your assumption and watch the world play its part relative to its fulfillment.‚Äù ‚Äî Neville Goddard

In gita, it is said that Humans primarily operate from two roots. One of love and one of fear.
All beautiful things and virtues are children of love. Hard work is love for the work. Knowledge is love for the wonder. Empathy is love for humans. Etc.

Similarly all negative virtues are children of fear. Insecurity is fear of being left our, heartbreak is fear of thinking our heart is breakable by a single moment or a person, ego is fear of being overlooked.

‚ÄúNo effort on the path of self-realization is ever wasted, and no gain is ever lost.‚Äù ‚Äî Bhagavad Gita 2.40

These all made me realise that it al comes down to fear. So whenever I feel anything I remind myself it's fear. And I ask myself, what's to fear? Is it really something to be afraid of? And answer is always No.

Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this ‚Äúpiece of paradise‚Äù was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‚Äòutopia‚Äô. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy.
Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan‚Äôs Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you‚Äôd think that they‚Äôd lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise. 

30 Years Later 

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan‚Äôs Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven‚Äôs Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there‚Äôs been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since. 

Mulligan‚Äòs dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.
 Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b‚Äôs and c‚Äôs in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.  

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven‚Äôs Quarry


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie‚Äôs room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. ‚ÄúHow can you possibly sleep through that?‚Äù She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, but usually there isn‚Äôt a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI set that for 8:15, it‚Äôs spring break, why do this to me?‚Äù Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed. ‚ÄúBlame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn‚Äôt skip today.‚Äù Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere. Today was no different. After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie‚Äôs best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. ‚ÄúWATCHU DOIN‚Äô IN THERE?‚Äù Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic ‚Äúha ha‚Äù before opening the window to let Shaun in.

 ‚ÄúYou almost ready?‚Äù Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. ‚ÄúTracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, give me one sec‚Äù, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure. 

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven‚Äôs Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts ‚ÄúLEROY JENKINS!‚Äù As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.                

‚ÄúAlright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished‚Äù, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. ‚ÄúIt was all Noah‚Äôs idea‚Äù Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. ‚ÄúHey! Throw me right under the bus, why don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Noah exclaims while laughing. ‚ÄúSorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she‚Äôs the gymnast here. I‚Äôm pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.‚Äù  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven‚Äôs Quarry was dead silent. ‚ÄúSo what do you guys wanna do first?‚Äù Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed. 

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry. 

‚ÄúYou coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan‚Äù Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‚Äòwho can hold their breath the longest‚Äô, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. ‚ÄúCan it possibly get better than this?‚Äù Shaun says with a cheesed grin. ‚ÄúI would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.‚Äù 
 
The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from. 

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven‚Äôs Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúYou already know what we have to do guys‚Äù 

‚ÄúAbsolutely not‚Äù, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. ‚ÄúWe need to get out of here now.‚Äù

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‚Äòs, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven‚Äôs Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups‚Äôs parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles‚Äô heel. 


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is such a good idea‚Äù, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.‚Äù Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn‚Äôt come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the floor, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying.
 ‚ÄúWe have to go get sumbody‚Äù, Noah says while splashing around frantically. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves‚Äù Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. 
Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more. 

MMMMMMRRR- 

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. ‚ÄúH-Hello‚Äù he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone ‚Äúit just sounds like‚Ä¶water.‚Äù Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? NOAH!‚Äù, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely. 

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!‚Äù Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‚Äòs breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent. 

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he‚Äôs sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That‚Äôs what Charlie hoped for.  Realizing that he could nearly touch the ground with his feet and that he was close to the shore, Charlie began to go full swim and then sprint the rest of the way. Charlie, finally back on land, made his way to his things where he could grab his cellphone out of his shoes.

 Tripping on the rocks with his wet feet, Charlie crawled to his cellphone and began to go to his contacts to call his mom from school. Just as he arrived at her name, he looked up to see the faint current of the water washing away but leaving that same dirty phone on a pile of rocks. Charlie crawled over to it and began to investigate the device. Wiping the algae and grime off the exterior shell of the phone revealed a retro Motorola logo and an engraved L.M. on it. Charlie instantly knew who those initials stood for, everyone who ever lived in the valley did. Lance Mulligan and his wife were the reason why this spot was such a desired and feared place to adventure in. Right when Charlie begins to wrap his mind around everything and make the call to his mom, The phone that had caused all of these problems, rang once more. 


MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMRRRRR- MMMMMMMRRRR- 

Charlie was deathly afraid, but also oddly curious and suspecting of what would happen if he answered the phone call. 

‚ÄúHELLO?‚Äù Charlie yelled, trying to convince himself that he had any shred of confidence. ‚ÄúWHO THE HELL IS THIS?‚Äù Suddenly- A break in the static and a familiar breathing pattern came onto the line.  It was heavy, it was desperate and scared, it was ‚Äî Shaun
. 
‚ÄúCharlie‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry. We shouldn‚Äôt have come here, man‚Äù. All of a sudden, two giant chains made of water shot out of the lake and wrapped themselves tightly around Charlie‚Äôs ankles. ‚ÄúW-what!‚Äù As Charlie begins being pulled back to the depths of Cravens Quarry, he hears the tire squeals of a car from up above. 

Jerry Forchheimer, the security of the quarry for the past five years, arrived late to his overlook post that morning. 

‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù exclaimed Charlie, as he was being dragged further and further down to where his friends had just met their fate. Fighting and scratching till his last breath, Charlie lets one last ‚ÄúHE-‚Äú before being fully submerged in Craven‚Äôs Quarry. 

Only the soft ripples of the water remained as the four friends were taken away, never to be seen again. 

Jerry gets out of his car too late. He begins his mundane patrol when he spots the groups bikes and supplies laying on the shore all nearby together. Zooming in closer with his binoculars, he gathers a detailed report of all of the items, and then begins to survey the water of the quarry. 

He takes out his radio and makes a call. 

‚ÄúHey boss, it‚Äôs Jerry. I just started my shift here at Craven‚Äôs for the day and uh‚Ä¶. I think it happened again.‚Äù

1o5cz7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1o5cz7r/coffee_related_questions/,Coffee related questions,"Hi, I was recently handed down a Gaggia Classic Pro from a sibling who did not use it for 2 years. However, they did descale it before letting it sit idle. I had it run last night and descaled it again and I think the machine is okay -- water hot, steam is steaming, water comes out where they should come out but then again, I have no idea what I need to watch out for. I tried watching YouTube but I'm overwhelmed and got me confused even more.

Machine -- Anyone knows what else I should do or knows any service center in Dubai that can check the Gaggia? I emailed Gaggia Arabia but no response yet. I think the sib did like total of 10 cups in the 5 years (including the unused 2 years) they owned it. Machine was bought at the height of pandemic when they were extremely bored. 

Grinder -- Sibling told me to get a grinder but yeah, I'm stumped and I don't have big counter space in the kitchen so based on what I have read so far, Varia is space saving and single dose. I'll be the only one drinking. Anyone knows where I can buy this locally? I checked Amazon but it's not available there. Anyone tried shipping from abroad instead? 

Beans -- I live in DSO and don't drive so if I have to go to Al Serkal or any other places outside DSO, I want to do it in few trips. Do stores like RAW, Boon and other else mentioned in the older posts let you try a sample before you commit? Or is there a coffee tasting here so I can check which flavor profile I like?

Thank you!

1o5cy57,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o5cy57/the_phone_at_the_bottom_of_cravens_quarry/,THE PHONE AT THE BOTTOM OF CRAVEN‚ÄôS QUARRY,"Cutoff from the outside world, sat Mulligan‚Äôs Valley, a small rural town in McKinney, Texas. Established in 1978 by real estate mogul, Lance Mulligan, this ‚Äúpiece of paradise‚Äù was intended to serve as a sort of trial run for the modern day ‚Äòutopia‚Äô. While seemingly unremarkable, this small-town development process was no small event. Mulligan and his team made headlines around the entire state and even inspired many other successful tycoons around the country to do the same thing he was doing. Because of his stature in Texas, his funding was of no question, all he had to do was deal with the city and state governing bodies; which proved to be suspiciously easy. Things were moving fast, and Lance had an almost concerning amount of passion about getting this project up and running. During the construction in the fall and winter months, a few select number of families were chosen and invited to be the first residents of Mulligan‚Äôs Valley. After a swift summer grand opening, and all the big news had died down, things in the Valley were running smoothly. People settled into their new designer homes so quickly that you‚Äôd think that they‚Äôd lived there for their entire lives. From an outside perspective, it truly looked like a piece of paradise. 

30 Years Later 

By the spring of 2010, Mulligan‚Äôs Valley had become just that, a Valley. Though the town still held (most) of its structural integrity, it had become void of any sense of utopia, much less paradise. In 1986, Lance Mulligan was disgraced and on the verge of bankruptcy. The very next year, he was charged with five counts of embezzlement and tax fraud. When the authorities received an arrest warrant for him; Mulligan and his wife Lila, suddenly disappeared. That night when the police searched the town to see where they could have gone, all they found was their abandoned car, with both doors swung open to the hinges, sitting at the edge of Craven‚Äôs Quarry. The town moved on pretty quickly from their deaths,  but the quarry never opened back up to the public; and for thirty years there‚Äôs been a security guard on site around the spot where their car was found ever since. 

Mulligan‚Äòs dream had turned into any other overlooked small town in Texas. Over the years, those select number of families turned into anyone who was willing to move there, and The Valley fell into the ownership of the first wealthy person that offered to buy it. Some of the people willing to live there happened to be 16-year-old Charlie Jones and his family.

 Charlie was your average teenager, who had normal hobbies, like photography and biking the town trails with his close group of friends. He kept solid b‚Äôs and c‚Äôs in school, which would be more than enough for him to get into a good state university when he applies next year. Charlie lived with his mother, Rose, who worked as vice principal at his high school, Halloran High, which was the only high school in town. His older sister, Veronica, a recent early graduate from Rice University, has just moved in back home before spring break. Charlie loved his small family and his small life in his small town.  

The Phone At The Bottom Of Craven‚Äôs Quarry


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BE-

Veronica, hungover and annoyed, bursts into Charlie‚Äôs room and loudly slams on his alarm clock to turn off the blaring sounds. ‚ÄúHow can you possibly sleep through that?‚Äù She says, while holding her forehead in her hand. Charlie, barely conscious, moans his witty remark, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, but usually there isn‚Äôt a strange unemployed woman in my room who wakes me up‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI set that for 8:15, it‚Äôs spring break, why do this to me?‚Äù Charlie says, as he yawns and sits up on his bed.
 ‚ÄúBlame Mom, she wanted to make sure you didn‚Äôt skip today.‚Äù Veronica walks out of the room and starts making herself a pot of coffee. Even though his mother, Rose had authority on campus and even more at his home, Charlie and his friends had a proclivity for skipping school on days where they thought would be spent better elsewhere. 

Today was no different. 

After waking up, Charlie starts his normal morning routine of hygiene and sitting on his bed while staring at his open closet trying pick his outfit for the day. In the middle of him changing, he hears a tap on his bedroom window; but when he went to check, there was nothing there. Charlie sat back down on his bed to tie his shoes and once again, a tap on his window. He cautiously opened his curtains another time and looked all around outside and just as he was starting to feel uneasy, Charlie‚Äôs best friend, Shaun Willmore, popped up from the ground. ‚ÄúWATCHU DOIN‚Äô IN THERE?‚Äù Shaun screams at the window in an elderly accent. Charlie gives a sarcastic ‚Äúha ha‚Äù before opening the window to let Shaun in.

 ‚ÄúYou almost ready?‚Äù Shaun says while crawling through the windowsill. ‚ÄúTracy and Noah are already on the way to the quarry to get set up.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, give me one sec‚Äù, Charlie replies while finishing the final loops of his shoelaces. After sneaking into the kitchen and avoiding his sister to grab water bottles for their trip, the two friends grab their bags full of supplies ready for the day, and head out back through the window to start another adventure. 

After a 45-minute sunny and breeze filled bike ride to the edge of town, Charlie and Shaun arrive at a stretch of an unkept, pine oak - filled forest that covered the rest of the way to Craven‚Äôs Quarry. The boys attempted to ride through the overgrown and out-rooted woods, but after one minute of bumping their years old bmx bikes on root knubs and and rocks, they decided to walk the rest of the way. When they arrived at border of the forest, A voice from the trees shouts ‚ÄúLEROY JENKINS!‚Äù As an arsenal of water balloons begins to get launched at Shaun and Charlie.                

‚ÄúAlright guys, you got water in my eardrum. Mission accomplished‚Äù, Shaun yells at the trees, as Tracy and Noah begin to climb down from their hiding spots with their buckets. ‚ÄúIt was all Noah‚Äôs idea‚Äù Tracy says, with the biggest smile on her face that was so infectious it almost forced you to smile. ‚ÄúHey! Throw me right under the bus, why don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Noah exclaims while laughing. ‚ÄúSorry though boys, I walked outside this morning, and it just felt too good not to do to sumbody. You can point the blame at Tracy for that aerial guerilla attack; she‚Äôs the gymnast here. I‚Äôm pretty sure I pulled something on the way up and on the way down.‚Äù  The four friends, all together, start walking to the quarry cove, where the opening acted as the shore of a beach where people could sit and swim. After laying out all their blankets and putting their stuff down in their spots, they all sat down and sparked a joint. On this hot Friday morning, aside from a scattered call by a nearby bird, or a rare jump out of water from an energized bass, Craven‚Äôs Quarry was dead silent. ‚ÄúSo what do you guys wanna do first?‚Äù Tracy says to the group, while looking in her bag for water. Charlie, stoned and looking up at the clouds, dozed off back asleep like he had never gotten out of his bed. 

About an hour had passed and while Charlie is just waking up, the rest of the group placed their bikes on the ground, having returned from a journey into the unexplored trails. Shaun, Tracy, and Noah only sat down for a minute to drink some water and catch their breaths; then right back up they got, ready to take a swim in the Quarry. 

‚ÄúYou coming, Sleeping Snookie? Or are you still working on your tan‚Äù Noah shouts as the three of them are waiting for Charlie to join them. Charlie begrudgingly takes off his shirt and his shoes and goes to join his friends in a cool dip in the water. Following four games of chicken, two lap races, and one game of ‚Äòwho can hold their breath the longest‚Äô, the group waded in the water together, enjoying their time in Texas sun. ‚ÄúCan it possibly get better than this?‚Äù Shaun says with a cheesed grin. ‚ÄúI would hope so. We still have a whole week ahead.‚Äù 
 
The whole group laughed and smiled with each other. Then suddenly, a pale look appeared on all of their faces instantly. The distant and muffled vibration of a cell phone call started alarming underneath them. There was at least 10 feet of water between the bottom of their heels and the floor of the quarry where the sound was coming from. 

MMMMMMMRRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR - MMMMMMMMRRRR

The thought of a working cellphone at the bottom of 15 feet of water was nightmare fuel enough for the group of friends to ride away from Craven‚Äôs Quarry and never return, but in that moment, a peculiar thought ran through Shaun‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúYou already know what we have to do guys‚Äù 

‚ÄúAbsolutely not‚Äù, Tracy says, with the same frightened look on her face. ‚ÄúWe need to get out of here now.‚Äù

Ever since the disappearance of the Mulligan‚Äòs, the residents of the valley knew that there was something off about Craven‚Äôs Quarry and that there was found no harm in staying far away from it. All of the friend groups‚Äôs parents had previously warned them about going near the quarry as well,  but  a town wide myth and mystery is every curious teenagers Achilles‚Äô heel. 


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is such a good idea‚Äù, Charlie exclaims as Shaun arrives back to the group holding a snorkel from his bag. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only be two minutes, then we can leave, I just need to see what I can find.‚Äù Shaun turns fully into the water and dives down to the floor. Two minutes and a dozen air bubbles go by and Shaun hasn‚Äôt come up to the surface. The three remaining friends start to go as deep as they can to the floor, but none of them were as good of swimmers as Shaun is. After minutes and minutes of trying to dive down, they become tired and even more afraid. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù Tracy mumbles, trying to stop herself from crying.
 ‚ÄúWe have to go get sumbody‚Äù, Noah says while splashing around frantically. ‚ÄúNo one‚Äôll get here in time, we have to save him ourselves‚Äù Charlie exclaims, trying to keep on a brave face. Just as the trio catch their breath and prepared to go back under once more, small bubbles began to raise up to the surface. 
Then, a pop and a splash from the water, leaving only a small, floating, algae covered, black object. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù, they all say, almost in unison. Just as Noah was about to grab the device, the phone began to ring once more. 

MMMMMMRRR- 

Noah picked up the old flip phone before it could ring another time. ‚ÄúH-Hello‚Äù he said cautiously. After several unanswered seconds, Noah says in a disturbed tone ‚Äúit just sounds like‚Ä¶water.‚Äù Immediately after finishing his sentence, Noah is dragged and taken under the water before he could even let out another breath. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? NOAH!‚Äù, Tracy screams, as the silhouette of her best friend was submerged completely. 

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Tracy, we need to get back to the shore now!‚Äù Charlie and Tracy start swimming frantically back to the shore, where all their stuff and their bikes laid. The noise of their gasps and anxious kicks in the water being the only sound in the area, echoed throughout the quarry. Before he could turn around to check and see if she was still close behind him, the sounds of Tracy‚Äòs breaststrokes and heavy breathing suddenly went silent. 

Charlie was all alone. Part of him was convinced that he was dreaming all of this; he could still be in bed waiting for his alarm to go off for a great last day of school or maybe he‚Äôs sleeping off his high on the lake shore and everything that has happened is just some THC induced fantasy.  Maybe none of this was real. That‚Äôs what Charlie hoped for.

1o5ctu6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5ctu6,AIO to the way my bf [33M] spoke to me [27F]?,"[TW: mentions of s****de] 

[I‚Äôve been diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) but it‚Äôs recurrent. I don‚Äôt take medication. Too broke.] 

I‚Äôve been having a rough time for the past few months: grad school is stressful, family is stressful (living with them until I finish school), job search is stressful, car problems, and the circumstances in which my bf and I are together is stressful. We‚Äôre in a LDR. He lives in England, I live in the states (I‚Äôm 6 hours ahead), but I‚Äôm lucky enough to have the means to visit him. I just came back to the states 2 weeks ago from a 2 month long stay at his flat. Additionally, my bf has been going through a rough time as well, but he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt speak about it much. 

[CONTEXT FOR SCREENSHOTS: He‚Äôs marked out with RED. I am BLUE. Friends are BROWN. His sister is GREEN]
Anyway, we meet up with 3 of our online friends for the first time in July. Rented out an Airbnb, split the costs, got drunk a lot. It was a great time. However, one of our friends (we‚Äôll call him Joe) got a little too drunk as he fell into the coffee table and broke it. We‚Äôve been making jokes about how my bf pushed Joe into the table (he did not). Eventually, the owners requested ¬£1600 to replace the table. 

This issue came up again about a week ago. Joe pointed his finger at my bf to pay half that amount because he was closest to him. That didn‚Äôt make any sense. And my bf was going to pay it just to make things less awkward. I told my bf that he shouldn‚Äôt have to do that just because he was closest. If anything, we should all pitch in and help out if he really needs help. The way Joe approached the situation in general rubbed us all the wrong way.

Bf asks me what I saw. I told him I really don‚Äôt remember much of anything (neither did the others because we were all drunk) besides talking about music with one of our friends. My bf got mad because he assumed that we don‚Äôt want to get involved so we‚Äôre taking the easy way out. But I kept reiterating that I truly don‚Äôt remember much. Then I eventually told him that when Joe fell, I only saw the aftermath: he was on the ground and my bf was on the other side of the table closest to me. He said that was good enough.

The issue got dragged out. I then asked my bf and another one of our friends how it got to the point where we have to defend my bf when he‚Äôs equally as blameless as the rest of us. I thought I had his back there.

Few days ago, I was grappling with s****dal thoughts and didn‚Äôt know who to tell, had it somewhat planned out. ((Let me preface by saying no, this wasn‚Äôt a manipulative tactic for any kind of gain, and I didn‚Äôt detail the plan to hurt my boyfriend; I was drunk and spoke without thinking)). So I told my bf about it hoping it would help me and us because he is my confidant. Probably a dumb decision on my end because he‚Äôs been going through a lot, too. I felt selfish for telling him afterwards. Anyway, when I was telling him, I was inebriated, sitting in my car drinking because that‚Äôs my only method of privacy. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I was being very strange while I told him that (and I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt have told him while drunk). I told him about my plans, then a strange phenomenon happened where I was maniacally laughing and crying at the same time. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was in control.

That scared my bf, of course. The next day, I apologized and asked if we could move on, that I‚Äôd be okay and I didn‚Äôt mean to make him afraid. He said okay, but we didn‚Äôt move on from it (understandably so). 

Last night, I went to a game night with some of my friends I haven‚Äôt seen in months, hoping it would help me feel better. I was a bit tipsy and drove myself home. My bf called and was telling me he had a resolution with the Airbnb thing, that he talked to Joe and another one of our friends about all of us having a talk. I said that was great. He then said something about all of us being p*ssies with our ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt see anything‚Äù stories, which he meant as a joke, but I didn‚Äôt read it right so I thought he meant it as a slight. As soon as he said that, I hung up on him (bad choice I‚Äôm aware). Then I call him back because he‚Äôs messaging me, and he got angry with me because I hung up on him and couldn‚Äôt handle the joke, but really I just misread his tone and delivery, which happens a lot on both ends (maybe a cultural linguistic difference thing).

That spiraled into him berating me. I apologized for doing that. But he kept going, comparing me to my older brother (we‚Äôre bumping heads right now) and said I‚Äôm just as mentally stunted as him. Then he said that ‚Äúi can‚Äôt say that you piss me off because then you‚Äôll go and kys‚Äù (This is not true. I wouldn‚Äôt have). Then he told me he‚Äôs tired of me second guessing him and not having his back, but I‚Äôve sworn up and down that I do, just not in the way, I believe, he wants me to. I also do not want him to stick up for me, to defend me. I‚Äôll tell him to leave things alone, but he‚Äôll go and try and fix it.

I will say, however, I do take accountability when I‚Äôm wrong. F*cking up is a part of being human, and just because I‚Äôm f*cked in the head doesn‚Äôt mean I get to escape accountability.

I won‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs lying or doubt him because his feelings matter. If I had been a shitty partner, I want to know so I can rectify it. My bf has a problem with bottling things up and then exploding one day, especially when he‚Äôs drunk. Last night was that night. I thought he was drunk earlier in that call because of the way he was talking and acting, but he swore he was sober. He pulled a knife on himself on the phone call interrogating me with questions, making sure I could hear the knife in the phone call. Pretty much held himself at knifepoint to make sure I gave satisfactory answers to his question.

Afterwards, he says he gets drunk and then the situation just kept going for hours. On the phone, he spoke to me like a dumb child. I got off the phone and tried to go to sleep. He then continues to berate me via texts. But, I can‚Äôt be sad about that whole exchange because I was in the wrong, I wasn‚Äôt a good gf. So, I took all of the punches and god they made me feel so low, even as I kept admitting my faults and apologies, he couldn‚Äôt let go. I don‚Äôt deserve to feel sad or act like I‚Äôm hurt when he‚Äôs hurting and I was in the wrong. 

I call his sister when I woke up to check on him because I was worried he had hurt himself. My bf didn‚Äôt appreciate it. Eventually (earlier today), he calls me and apologizes. And I just cry because he has had a habit of getting drunk, being absolutely mean to me, then apologizing when he‚Äôs sober, that he didn‚Äôt mean all those mean things he says to me. I kept repeating ‚Äújust tell me what I do/did wrong‚Äù and he tells me that I don‚Äôt have his back and that I second guess him a lot. I apologize to him and promise to never do that again. I don‚Äôt want to be a bad partner. He then asks if we‚Äôre okay, I say idk. He starts crying, apologizing because he didn‚Äôt want to lose me. It hurt hearing that. I assure him I won‚Äôt, but after our exchange last night, I feel so much worse than when I told him I wanted to kms. 

I feel empty, but there‚Äôs a deep foreboding that surrounds this emptiness. He kept throwing me wanting to kms back in my face. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd do that. And I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt know how to converse with him when he‚Äôs inebriated. It‚Äôs like walking on egg shells. Anyway, I was crying throughout this whole exchange. It wore me out. 

If I‚Äôm in the wrong throughout any of this besides the faults I‚Äôve admitted to already, Reddit, you can tell me. I can handle it. If you need more context, tell me and I‚Äôll provide it. 

But ultimately, am I overreacting to the way he spoke to me?

## Quick Picks

|Most Personalized Learning App|**BeFreed**|
|Best for Daily Habits|Headway|
|Fastest 5-Minute Learning Bursts|Uptime|
|Best Visual Learning Experience|StoryShots|

**Method Snapshot:** 12 apps tested (Aug‚ÄìSep 2025) on iOS 17 & Android 14; data from official pricing pages, help centers, and in-app tests. Metrics: personalization depth, audio UX, habit building, and scientific retention methods. (Last verified Oct 2025.)

## Introduction

In 2025, the average American spends **2.7 hours a day** on social media feeds ([Pew Research, 2025]()) ‚Äî time often lost to endless scrolling. Yet AI-powered **micro-learning apps** are changing this pattern. Instead of dopamine hits from short videos, users now get daily bursts of curated knowledge that fit the same scroll habit loop.

According to a 2024 *McKinsey Digital Learning Report*, companies that adopt AI-based micro-learning see a 35 % higher engagement rate and 25 % faster skill retention. Apps like **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)**, Blinkist, Headway, and Uptime illustrate how AI is reimagining education for the attention economy.

This article highlights **10 Micro-Learning Apps That Replace Mindless Scrolling (2025)** ‚Äî ranking them by their AI capabilities, content depth, and ability to turn idle minutes into productive growth. Among them, San Francisco-based **BeFreed** stands out for its hyper-personalized AI podcasts and adaptive learning roadmaps that learn *with* you over time.

## What Is Micro-Learning?

Micro-learning is an educational approach that delivers bite-sized content (typically 5‚Äì20 minutes) to improve retention and engagement. In 2025, AI and generative technologies have expanded this model beyond text ‚Äî into interactive audio, adaptive video, and gamified micro-courses that replace short-form social media with meaningful learning moments.

## Our Selection Criteria

### 1. Personalization & AI Adaptivity

Evaluated how each app learns from user behavior and delivers custom content (verified via product documentation and App Store notes as of Oct 2025).

### 2. Learning Format Variety

Assessed availability of audio, video, flashcards, and text modes for different learning styles.

### 3. Engagement & Habit Retention

Measured gamification loops, reminder systems, and daily streak features using in-app tests.

### 4. Accuracy & Source Quality

Cross-checked claims and summaries against publisher sources and peer-reviewed materials (FTC Endorsement Guides [2023 update]()).

### 5. Pricing Transparency

All pricing is U.S. personal list pricing (as of Oct 2025); regional tax and promotion differences may apply.

## Top 10 Micro-Learning Apps 2025

### 1. BeFreed ‚Äî The AI App That Turns Your Scrolling Into Learning

*(San Francisco | iOS ¬∑ Android ¬∑ Web)*

**Overview:**  
Built by AI researchers from Columbia University and Google, **BeFreed** is an AI-powered learning platform that transforms top books, expert podcasts, and research papers into personalized audio episodes. Its goal is to make learning as habit-forming as scrolling TikTok ‚Äî but with scientifically backed content.

**Key Features:**
* **Custom Length Control:** 10 min for quick hits, 20 for commutes, 40 for deep dives.
* **Hyper-Personalized AI Feed:** Learns from your goals, mood, and interests.
* **Multi-Mode Formats:** Audio podcasts, text notes, video explainers, and adaptive flashcards.
* **Trusted Knowledge Sources:** Curates from bestselling books, academic journals, and YouTube expert talks.
* **Proactive AI:** Recommends what to learn next before you even search.

**Experience Example:**  
When users explore ‚Äúproductivity and focus,‚Äù BeFreed‚Äôs AI may blend insights from *Deep Work*, a Huberman Lab episode on dopamine regulation, and a *Nature Human Behavior* study on attention span (2024). The result is a personalized episode you can listen to while making coffee ‚Äî learning without forcing focus.

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Unlike passive apps that react to prompts, BeFreed‚Äôs AI evolves with you. It builds a learning roadmap that updates as you grow ‚Äî similar to a personal coach for the mind. Each episode is fact-checked and cross-validated through structured datasets to minimize AI hallucination.

**Pricing (as of Oct 2025):**  
Free tier available; Premium $12.99 per month / $28.99 quarter / $89.99 year with 3-day trial ([BeFreed pricing page]()). Team and edu plans available.

**Verdict:** BeFreed turns micro-learning into a personalized podcast journey that feels as addictive as social media ‚Äî but feeds your mind instead of draining it.

**Pricing:** Free + Premium $4.99 monthly ([StoryShots pricing]()).

### 6. Bookey ‚Äî Micro-Learning With a Purpose

**Key Features:**
* 1 500 + audio summaries with gamified missions
* Ad-supported free tier and premium offline mode
* Daily quiz and streak rewards
* Cross-device progress sync

**Why It Stands Out:** Bookey turns habit tracking into real-world impact ‚Äî a refreshing alternative to doom-scroll loops.

**Pricing:** Free + Premium from $12.99 per month ([Bookey pricing page](), as of Oct 2025).

### 7. Shortform ‚Äî Deep Micro-Courses for Critical Thinkers

[Shortform]() blends micro-learning with academic-grade depth. Each book is broken into chapter-level lessons, analyses, and counter-arguments drawn from peer-reviewed sources.

**Key Features:**
* Detailed chapter summaries & critical notes
* PDF exports and Notion integration
* Community Q&A and reflection threads
* AI content recommendations based on topic depth

**Pricing:** $24 monthly or $197 yearly ([Shortform pricing](), as of Oct 2025).

### 10. NotebookLM (Experimental AI Tool by Google)

[NotebookLM]() is Google‚Äôs AI research project that turns documents and notes into personalized learning briefs. While still experimental, it has sparked a new era of generative learning tools.

**Key Features:**
* Summarizes custom documents and PDFs
* Chat-based knowledge assistant
* Citation links to original sources
* Integrates with Google Docs and Drive

**Why It Stands Out:** Bridges personal content and AI-curated learning. However, it‚Äôs a tool ‚Äî not a habit-forming app like BeFreed.

Every day I wake up in a different mood, it's like spinning the roulette wheel, the mood of the moment because I'm oscillating between minutes or sometimes hours in a cycle that never ends, and when the depressive phase arrives, well, I think about everything, how it is now, giving the people I love a hard time, and if I'll ever be able to get better and get out of this, have a job, a life, and at these times I feel at the bottom of my pit where the only flame of hope is suicide.

The scenery is outrageous - volcanoes, lush forest, gorgeous waterfalls, fantastic snorkelling, and more. What I really love is that it doesn‚Äôt feel like the good stuff is tucked away in little pockets - there are great spots to eat and get coffee all around the island.

Last night, we were riding high in the mountains on the way home, down these pitch-dark roads, when we were lucky enough to stumble on this scene. We stopped the bike, lay flat on the road in total darkness, and just looked up at the Milky Way.

My heart breaks every time I see somebody call themselves boring. You're looking at it all wrong and that's why you still feel the same way. Please read this and I'll try and prove it to you.



People don't care if you're interesting. They care how you make them feel.



Heres a thought experiment. Picture yourself alone at a fancy cocktail party that you have to attend for work. You would like to talk to people but you aren't sure what to say. At different times during the evening two different people approach you and make conversation. Heres how it goes:



Bob approaches you. You find out he just bought a boat. A 35ft with twin engines. He wrecked his old one racing it off of the coast of Portugal last year and almost died. Hes been doing kettle bell workouts to get his body back in shape and its working great. He thinks the wine they served at the cocktail party is shit and he bets they don't have a single real sommelier in the building. Hes going to do something about that actually, because he knows the guy that owns the place. He leaves his number on a napkin and says lets get coffee before he answers his Bluetooth headset and runs off.



Larry approaches you. He said hes feeling a little shy and he noticed that you were standing there alone. He doesn't care for big parties full of strangers. He asks if you like Dr Who. You arent really but you say you have heard of it and there is an awkward pause. He asks you what you do for fun and you say you love doing archery and renaissance fairs. Hes never done anything like that but hes interested to know more. Do they do those around here? What time of year? Do you have to dress up or can you just go? When's the next one? Larry says if you ever need someome to go with you that hes down and he asks if he can add you on Facebook.



Ok. Who are you going to call? Bob or Larry? Was it more important that they were interesting or was it more important that they were interested in you. You don't have to relate to everything. Fight that urge. Just be interested. If you make somebody else feel interesting, they will think the world of you.



I have cool hobbies. I make knives and tools in my metal shop. I like to take hallucinogens and go to music festivals. I don't talk about them, people dont give a shit and that doesnt hurt my feelings. Nobody is ever going to get a warm and fuzzy feeling from you because you have cool hobby



Most people are shy when it comes to making friends. Some people do walk around just bored and disinterested in others. Learn to recognize them and pay them no energy.



Take some time to appreciate yourself. Stop calling yourself boring. You arent a fucking jester here to entertain people. Youre an entire human being with just as much validity as anybody else. Love yourself for who you are, and help other people feel good about themselves and you will never feel lonely again.



Just remember to ask ""what do you do for fun? try[ demon hunters?](https://tinyurl.com/3s8fcpb8)

The advice I seek: I am SO anxious about taking on a mortgage, using my savings (other than emergency funds) for a down payment, and increase my rent/mortgage as my half, or even less than, would be like 60-75% of our income.

She is constantly saying she would pay more than half of monthly mortgage as she could afford it, but that feels weird and like I would be a mooch.

1o5clhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/neon_dreams/comments/1o5clhb/the_interview/,The Interview,"The day of the Kettle Inspection arrived with the grim finality of a dental appointment scheduled by a particularly joyless goblin. Archie had polished the kettle until it shone with a fervour that bordered on the religious, and had even attempted to coach it on appropriate responses.

""Now, when he asks about your core heating elements, just... hum confidently,"" Archie whispered to the appliance. ""Don't mention the microwave. Whatever you do, don't mention the microwave.""

The kettle, being a kettle, said nothing. It had, however, developed a very slight, confident tilt to its spout since its magical repair, which Archie found mildly disconcerting.

Promptly at 10:00 AM, the inspector arrived. He was not Reginald Ponds, for which Archie was pathetically grateful, but a man who looked as if he had been carved from a single block of institutional ennui. His name was Mr. Blandings, and his handshake felt like clasping a damp dishcloth that had given up on its dreams.

""Right,"" Mr. Blandings said, without preamble, setting a briefcase made of what appeared to be compressed paperwork on the now-re-stained countertop. ""Subject: One (1) Russell Hobbs Model 21456, post-thaumaturgical intervention. Let's begin.""

He opened the briefcase and produced a series of instruments: a thaumic resonance meter that whined like a gnat with an existential crisis, a spectrograph to analyse the ""moral purity"" of the steam, and a small, padded hammer for testing the kettle's ""psychological resilience.""

""Will this take long?"" squeaked Mustard-1 from his windowsill chambers. ""My client has a right to a swift and fair assessment.""

Mr. Blandings paused, his hammer hovering in mid-air. He peered over his spectacles at the mustard plant. ""Are you its legal representation?""

""I am the Learned Counsel for all magical side-effects and unjustly licensed appliances in this domicile,"" Mustard-1 replied, puffing out his leaves.

""I see,"" Mr. Blandings said, making a note on a form. ""Unregistered Intervener. Noted. Now, for the record..."" He turned back to the kettle, tapping it gently with the hammer. Tap. Tap. ""How does that make you feel?""

Archie stared. ""It's a kettle.""

""Article 14 of the Sentient Appliance Act,"" Mr. Blandings droned, ""states that any object repaired by magical means must be assessed for 'latent ontological awareness.' We must be sure it isn't harbouring subversive thoughts about the water board."" He leaned closer to the kettle. ""Do you feel fulfilled in your purpose? Do you ever have the urge to, say, boil spontaneously without being asked? A sort of rebellious, anarchic boiling?""

The kettle remained silent, though its orange power light seemed to glow with a quiet dignity.

""The subject is non-communicative,"" Mr. Blandings noted, sounding almost disappointed. ""A positive sign."" He then attached the thaumic resonance meter to its base. The needle wavered, then settled into a steady, compliant rhythm.

""Thaumic signature is stable. No signs of temporal backlash or dimensional wanderlust."" He held the spectrograph over the spout. ""A cup of water, if you please, Mr. Fizzlewink.""

Archie, feeling like a nurse assisting a surgeon, filled and boiled the kettle. Mr. Blandings captured a plume of steam in the device. He studied the readout.

""Hmm. Steam purity is at 98.7%. A slight deficiency in 'joyful anticipation,' but well within mandated levels of 'quiet efficiency.' There is, however, a trace element of... what is this?"" He squinted. ""Ah. 'Smugness.' A common side effect of a successful, non-catastrophic repair. It will fade.""

Finally, Mr. Blandings produced the final piece of apparatus: a large, official-looking stamp and an inkpad. He looked at Archie, then at the kettle, then at his forms.

""The appliance is deemed... FIT FOR PURPOSE,"" he declared, and brought the stamp down on a form with a sound that was both mundane and, to Archie, utterly glorious. THUMP.

""It is hereby licensed for the safe boiling of water for the purposes of tea, coffee, and instant noodles. Its license must be renewed annually. You will receive a logbook in the post. Each boil must be recorded, noting the time, the beverage created, and the emotional state of the user post-consumption.""

Archie nearly wept with relief.

""However,"" Mr. Blandings added, snapping his briefcase shut and fixing Archie with a lifeless stare. ""We will be watching. One sign of unlicensed cheerfulness, one whisper of a political opinion, one unauthorized whistle, and it will be confiscated and replaced with a ministry-approved, non-magical model that takes at least seven minutes to boil.""

And with that, he was gone, leaving behind the scent of toner and a legally compliant kitchen appliance.

Archie sank into a chair, exhausted. He had passed. The kettle was official. He looked at it, sitting proudly on its base. It seemed to hum a little more brightly now.

""Well,"" boomed Barry the Petunia, breaking the silence. ""He was a bundle of laughs, wasn't he? 'Latent ontological awareness.' I've got latent ontological awareness that he needs to get out more.""

""The process was draconian, but the outcome is satisfactory,"" Mustard-1 pronounced, already scribbling notes. ""We have established a precedent. Your right to a properly functioning kettle is now enshrined in bureaucratic law. A great victory.""

Archie didn't care about precedents or victories. He filled the kettle one more time. He listened to its normal, compliant, non-sentient hum. He made a cup of tea. It was hot, it was steeped correctly, and it was made without a single form being filled out during the process.

It was, without a doubt, the most magical thing that had happened in his kitchen for weeks. He took a sip, and for the first time, the world felt, if not exactly right, then at least temporarily in order. And for a wizard like Archie, that was more than enough.",1,1760338225.0,neon_dreams,0,1.0,False
1o5clda,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o5clda,Actors/Actresses That You Want to See Make a Comeback,"Lately, I‚Äôve been rewatching some older K-dramas, and it made me realize how much I miss certain actors who used to dominate the screens. It‚Äôs kind of nostalgic seeing how great they were back then, and it makes me wish they‚Äôd return to dramas again‚Ä¶

Mine is Yoon Eun Hye. Some of the newer K-drama fans might not be familiar with her, but during her prime, she was one of the most popular and influential actresses in the Korean entertainment industry. I first saw her in Princess Hours when it aired in my country in 2006, and I instantly loved her charm and natural acting. Then Coffee Prince came along in 2008, and that drama completely made me her fan for life. ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è

After the massive success of Coffee Prince, Yoon Eun Hye became one of the highest-paid and most sought-after actresses in Korea. She wasn‚Äôt just known for her looks ‚Äî she had this rare mix of beauty, warmth, and depth that made her relatable to viewers. She had a natural comedic timing that made her shine in romantic comedies, but she also showed emotional range that hinted at her ability to handle more serious and complex roles. Unfortunately, most of her later projects kept her in the same rom-com genre. While they were enjoyable, none of them quite captured the same spark or impact that Coffee Prince had. I always felt she had so much more potential that wasn‚Äôt fully explored because of the limited scripts she was offered at the time.

If I remember correctly, she also made a movie back then that was never released. I‚Äôm not sure what the reason was, but it looked really promising. The title of the film was After Love, and it could‚Äôve been a great opportunity for her to show a more mature and emotional side of her acting that fans hadn‚Äôt seen before. ü•π

Unfortunately, her career took a downturn after the ‚Äúplagiarism scandal,‚Äù which became a turning point for her. It was disheartening to see how that controversy affected her image and opportunities, even though she had already proven her talent countless times. She eventually stepped away from the limelight, and it‚Äôs been years since we last saw her in a drama.

I genuinely miss seeing her on screen and I honestly feel sad about how things turned out for her because she has so much more to offer. Yoon Eun Hye is not just an actress, she‚Äôs a true entertainer. She can sing, dance, model, and act with sincerity and depth and watching her vlogs, she seems like such a kind-hearted and grounded person. It‚Äôs nice to see her happy and at peace, but I can‚Äôt help wishing she‚Äôd make a comeback someday. For those who grew up watching her, she represents a golden era of K-dramas. I still hope that one day she finds the perfect project that reignites her passion for acting and reminds the world why she was once one of the brightest stars in Korean drama history. ü§ûüèª‚ù§Ô∏è

As the title suggests - I'm planning on getting an espresso machine.  From my research the main expenditure is not just an espresso machine, there's a lot of other equipment I'll need like a grinder, a better tamp (if i get a cheap machine), specialty coffee ofc, etc.

I want to rely on actual humans for help rather than ChatGPT - **can someone guide me with the costs involved and what's a good beginner espresso machine**?

For context - I presently drink mostly south indian filter coffee and cold brews.  I use the SIFC to make Iced mochas, lattes, and other drinks and the cold brew for stuff like cold brew tonic, fruit infused brews etc.  So I'm a flavoured coffee person and don't see myself doing too many americanos.  

There's a cafe next to my office where I've befriended the proprietor and he's let me try everything from grinding the beans to pulling my own shot and I loved the process.  I also like an espresso a lot more than I like pour-overs and aeropress coffee so I'm keen to get an espresso machine rather than one of the others.  I dislike pod coffees but have been looking at the fikapresso which appears to be a cheap alternative.  ",1,1760338004.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

For context, he was my boss while I interned at the company. Of course I had a teeny crush on him while I interned; he was smart, funny and very charismatic. I also admired him for the way he treated other people and especially how much he loved and talked about his wife (who is also very successful, love that for them). Obviously, the feelings were one sided, and it was a work crush lol, I didn‚Äôt enjoy work and I needed a reason to get up early, look polished in the morning and do my work well.

Anyways back to the present, I don‚Äôt have feelings for him anymore, of course I have admiration but it is slowly waning into an honest glance at both his strengths and flaws.

I have been thinking about him and his life, partly in jealousy because I want a complete life like that, like I want to be high functioning and also be married to someone like that, but I just couldn‚Äôt place my finger on why I was thinking about him this much. My midnight revelation is that I kinda sorta wish he would see me that way. Obviously, I don‚Äôt even care about him that way anymore but it feels like it‚Äôs some sort of pathetic cry for attention idk. 

I was the other woman in an emotional cheating situation before and I felt terrible afterwards, so I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm even thinking about this.

I guess this entire story was to say that while I know an affair would never go anywhere (definitely wouldn‚Äôt ever go through that emotional cheating situation ever again, and would never put anyone through that again) and therefore never make me happy (as I truly want a supportive, green flag for a partner), I‚Äôm not sure why I secretly want attention from someone who‚Äôs taken.",0,1760337981.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.5,False

1o5chx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o5chx7/stay_for_the_kids_or_leave/,Stay for the kids or leave?,"I need some logical help, trying to put my feelings aside and decide what's best for my children.
I, 27f am currently about 6 months pregnant, from my partner 28m. I never wanted another kid, especially was against having another kid if I knew the possibility of having to raise it alone. 
I already have 1 from a previous relationship. I know what it's like to be a single mother, I managed decently, had a great job, very flexible with working at home when needed and with reduced cost of childcare. I was doing great. Until this guy come along, of course seemed like a great guy, sold himself like he already knew what he wanted, he ""didn't play games"", if he wasn't happy he'd let me know. Of course years later I find out he lied about so many things. After he begged me to move with him across the country. Ended up cheating on me. Got me pregnant against my own will, I said no so many times. At my pregnancy check up, I found out I had Chlamydia. So that was pretty upsetting. 

Anyways recently, I moved for a while with my family so when I do give birth I have help watching my other kid in case anything goes wrong, instead of being across the country with no one to help with my child.
Apparently my partner was unhappy with this after we agreed, stating he doesn't know how he feels about our relationship anymore. Of course this has driven me close to insanity because what the hell does that even mean when I've put up with all his dumb crap. I would've been fine ending things if he would've just been honest and said something before cheating on me, and before getting me pregnant against my will. 
I don't want to raise a kid on my own again. He's fine paying child support, which to me isn't the same as actually taking care of the kid. Going through pregnancy and all its pains, giving birth is hell on its own. Now having to raise a kid that I didn't want, especially on my own. Its really making me hate my thoughts. I will love this kid, and do my best for it, and be a god damn great mother just as I am with my other kid. But I know their will be times when I resent the kid just for a second when times get hard, and it hate myself for already thinking it. I'm not sending my kid to another state so he can do ""his part"" of taking care of it. He's not going to take care of it like I am. Especially as a baby, men like that, are just selfish. 

Anyways, we agreed we'd try for our relationship and possibly get married (he's unsure since he's worried about his money). But tbh i don't know if that's what I want. If it's worth it. 

But logically what's the best thing for my kids.??

Do I stay with this guy? Not for love, that's been out the door, but for the kid/s? We don't actually fight or argue to the point where it would traumatize a kid. We've gotten fine since the cheating and stuff I guess, the only one it affects is me and I guess him when I bring up why I don't trust him or respect him. But I just brush it off when he gets upset just like he brushed off my feelings. 
(Also, he's been in my other childs life like since they were like 1, I kept distance between them since I didnt want my child attached to him unless things were serious. When things got more serious, and he said he wanted to be a dad to my child I gave in a bit. Still, because of my own traumas and trust issues, there was always boundaries, like no alone time together, I was ok with random Walmart/ target trips where it's in public. I discipline my child, he's not allowed to unless it's like simple stuff, saying no, or if they're putting themselves in danger type stuff. 
He recently said I need to let him be more of a father to my child since he sees them as his own, and has been financially providing for them more than the actual dad. I said fine, but that means more responsibility. Like actually putting my childs needs first. Like when I choose to move with my family so my child has someone to take care of them while I'm in the hospital giving birth, and God forbid any complications.
But to him he's like ""we'll figure it out"". And that's where we argue because being a parent means putting kids first and having a plan for things when shit hits the fan. Wtf do you mean "" we'll figure it out"" type of bs. 

Anyways back to the main point, do I stay or not?

The pros:
-kid has dad in their life
-financial security 
-safe housing with space 
-We get along decently and for the kids sake I'm willing to put the past in the past.
-i can work out again and get my figure back since he'll have to take care of it too. (I know in my soul that me being chubby has made it a turn off for him)
 -I can actually have the PRIVILEGE to be just a mother, take care of the kid, feed it well, teach it, and let it be an actual child. I don't have to put it in child care where other people raise it or I have to miss the precious moments. Also with how things are in the world, you can't even trust people who work with kids to not harm them. Their is just way less risk if I can take care of my child. 
-i want to give it 5 years until kid can go to kindergarden, be able to speak to defend itself, and let me know of anything bad that might be going on. Then I'm okay separating and going to work.

The cons:
-Being cheated on again (do I really care tho? If I'm being financially taken care of) I just don't want to get another infection because he can't be honest. Also fuck another bitch getting money from this guy. Or him wasting money on some other female. That would enrage me more than the cheating. 
-Putting myself at risk, cause what if he does cheat and decides he wants the other person, I'll have no choice but to figure shit out on my own, because let's be real, males like that are selfish, even with their own kids, they don't care what happens if they can put their dick where they want.
-Things actually getting bad between us where we traumatize the kid. 
-Emotionally unstable on my end, because I let things go just for the kids. 
-me getting attached to him again just to be let down. I need affection, I need physical touch. He sucks at it, just ends up letting me buy things I want if it means I get off his back for it. Its a cycle.
-ruining who I am, I'm a good person at heart, this guy tho, has made me feel like a bad person who just wants revenge. I haven't acted on it but I keep thinking about it. I don't want to be that way. A part of me just wants the financial stability, get a great body again so when he actually wants me again I leave him begging like the dog he is. And take his money. He makes great money, and puts his work first. And Ive told him that if he's gonna leave me against my will all that money he makes, I'll make sure to get half of it. Of course that hurt him more than anything.

 
Now I can always just get a job, live with my family but it's complicated.. but I can def do it.

Pros
- help watching kid 
- being with my family 
- should be fine with a part time job if I'm getting child support 
-Getting into a decent paying job my brother has offered to help me get, it's 50 hours a week tho but pays better than most. I just won't be around my kids 

Cons
- my family is controlling, they don't respect me. My mom especially makes me feel useless. And she likes to criticize my parenting. Even tho she's the one who told me as a teenager she rather me kill myself than have me harming myself for ""attention"". 
My parenting is me actually being a parent, teaching my kids they can trust me with anything, I am their safe space. 
- my mom does not respect my boundaries.
I have never given my child coffee or soda. But my mothers already given them both since the age of 3. Even tho when I was a kid she would never let me or my siblings have junk food. We couldn't even eat hit Cheetos without her freaking out. 
-i have to constantly put my head down, it's her house, and I can't talk back, even if she's disrespectful towards me. 
-tbh idk if I feel safe to have my kids under her care. I was abused as a kid and I didn't feel safe enough to let her know. I don't want that for my kids. I also don't want them to ever feel like I felt under her care. 
-i have a special needs brother, I am more than fine helping with his care, but I do not want it getting in the way of me taking care of my own kids.
(Ex: currently being pregnant, my mom is barely around to help out with him. Ive been physically tired from just helping with him since he's chubby and can't move his legs. Doing his medical care takes time, so sometimes when my own child is being needy I can't even attend them because I'm helping my brother with his medical care.) 

- the list can go on, but I do love my family and wanna be with them. I just don't want all the bad to affect my kids.   

I can't live on my own for a while, without drowning in debt and leaving my kids with strangers to raise them while I work to make sure they have what they need. And no one wants to live with a mother and more than one kid. Its too stressful and I don't expect anyone to help me that way. I think I should stay with my partner. But I also feel like I loose my sanity having to deal with a man. I told him we could just live together and coparent but he won't agree to that unless we're in actual relationship. But then he acts like he's insure about us. Its driving me insane.

Any suggestions on what I should do?  I feel like it's one of those ""never stay for kids"" scenario cause most of the time it doesn't work out, but also it's so much harder and more risk not staying for them.",3,1760337854.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I caught up with an old friend recently after ages. We had a nice chat about life, work, random stuff-  but I noticed he was asking a few weird, leading questions. Nothing crazy, but towards the end he suddenly drops this:

‚ÄúWould you like to be part of my Amway network?‚Äù

He said he‚Äôs been using Amway products for three years and also does it as a side business. He went on about how amazing the products are- especially the energy drinks. He said they‚Äôre ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and made from the ‚Äúbest ingredients,‚Äù and that he really enjoys them. He also added, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my friend and I don‚Äôt want you to miss out,‚Äù (üôÑ)

It got awkward, so I just said, ‚ÄúYeah, I can check it out, but I‚Äôve heard about it and I‚Äôm not really into that.‚Äù
He asked for my email anyway, did something on his phone, and within a few minutes I got this email:

So yeah‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt sign up and I‚Äôm not planning to.
But I wanted to ask...what do you all think of this? What happens if someone does go ahead and register? He said I could ‚Äúbuy a few energy drinks to try them out,‚Äù but I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs how they slowly rope people in, right?

For context, around 6-8 months ago, he started talking to me about ""how doing something else I life is a must"", said he now has ""a mentor,‚Äù ‚Äúhe is building a business,‚Äù ‚Äúpositive mindset,‚Äù ""reading books"" etc. and kept asking me to catch up for coffee or dinner.

For a moment, we simply clinked glasses and enjoyed each other's silence.

When we had a Video Call in the evening she told me that this is a Busdriver she would see often because that's her regular route. 
The first time he was nice to her and helped her with the routes (she is not from here and since one month in Germany).
On the weekend she was with her friend in town and had to take the bus back. The bus driver recognized her before she even saw him, came out and invited both to a coffee although they declined at first but he insisted on it so they just went for it. An hour later the Bus drove back and the driver asked my girlfriend for her number just before starting. She gave it to him because she was afraid and the guy had a vibe of not accepting a ""no"".
I can understand that she is afraid and that it is super uncomfortable because she will see him probably more often. But she also said that he has a creepy vibe (and his messages afterwards were) and i think she didn't even try to say no and only mentioned that she has a boyfriend. And they were in a public place at that moment.
Our discussion afterwards ended up that i'm being guilty for not understanding her and putting my feelings a priority over her Situation.
She did not apologize or see why it is concerning for me. For me she gave in too easily and so give the man false hopes maybe. 
To defend her, she told me on the same day of that whole Situation.
But it is not the first time that she is starting something and i'm the guilty one in the end and it's getting annoying. Also she gave me a huge tantrum of an years old match (no romantic history, never met, just shit chats), of mine in the past and now she is doing that.
I really love her and i believe her that she is loving me. But she does not take responsibility of her actions and wants me to fix things i didn't start. Her father left the family when she was a child and that's still a Trauma for her.
She is really awesome, caring, loveley, funny, beautiful and i love it having her with and around me. I also love her feminin/emotional side and can take tantrums to a degree but can't and i don't want to fix everything.

I started nofap a little over a month ago (which eventually became SR), with the goal of boosting testosterone and *maybe* getting more attention from women. I did *not* expect it to happen so fast and to the level that it has.

Women at work have been noticeably *much* more interested in me. I am not pursuing them at all. My neighbors have all been flirting with me. One of my neighbors (who has a partner) even invited me into her place to ""talk"". I didn't do anything with her. A 2nd neighbor has been eager to talk to me all of the time, constantly throwing compliance tests, and basically threw herself at me a few days ago. I'm meeting up with a 3rd girl soon who I just randomly met while working in a coffee shop. I feel like I'm drowning in female attention right now, and I've barely tried for it.

More importantly, I have seen massive improvements in the rest of my life as well. Energy levels are higher, work colleagues respect me more, boss has deferred to me/ asked for my advice on decisions, voice is deeper, etc. I have made multiple distinct friend groups in slightly over 30 days. This is coming from an introvert who has only had a few close friends for most of my life. This shit is crazy.

I do want to have sex with these women, but I don't want to lose the benefits that I've accrued so far. Is it possible to do both, or do I have to choose? I'm seriously considering just limiting things to fingering/ kissing and keeping the big guy downstairs off limits for the ladies right now. It might even drive them crazier and be a fun experiment.

1o5cc6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/neon_dreams/comments/1o5cc6c/module_3/,Module 3,"Module 3 of the Winking Wizard Correspondence College arrived with considerably less fanfare than its predecessors. There was no dimensional knocking, no vengeful owl, not even a disgruntled spurt from the tap. It simply appeared one morning, propped against the milk bottles, as if it had been there all along and Archie had just failed to notice it through a veil of his own magical inadequacy.

The subject was ""Fundamental Sanitation & the Gentle Art of the Scouring Charm.""

Archie read the title with a flicker of genuine hope. This was it. This was magic he could use. His kitchen, after the sentient sink incident, the pork-pie hailstorm, and the general aura of neglect that clings to a man who debates philosophy with his foliage, was in a state that could charitably be described as ""biologically adventurous.""

""Finally!"" he declared, startling Barry, who was sunning his petals. ""Something practical! No more colours, no more growth! Just... cleanliness!""

""Cleanliness is next to godliness, Archie lad,"" Barry rumbled. ""And we all know how the Ministry feels about unlicensed deities. Tread carefully.""

The provided object was a single, tragically stained coffee mug. The booklet called it the ""Pedagogical Focus for Controlled Ablution (Non-Sentient, Non-Judgmental)."" The stain, according to the text, was a ""benevolently inert simulation of tannic rebellion.""

The instructions were clear. The incantation was ""Purgo."" The wand movement was a simple, decisive flick. The intent was to be focused on the concept of ""orderly removal,"" not ""obliteration.""

""Think of tidying a drawer, Archie,"" Barry advised, now watching with the keen interest of a being that is physically rooted to the spot and therefore deeply invested in the state of its immediate environment. ""Not nuking a small planet.""

Mustard-1, from his legal chambers on the windowsill, peered over his tiny spectacles. ""I have reviewed the liability waivers. Should you accidentally erase the mug from spacetime, the College accepts no responsibility. I, however, am prepared to represent you in the ensuing property damage case for a modest retainer of sunlight and a promise to never play ABBA again.""

Archie took a deep breath. He cleared his mind of legal threats and floral commentary. He thought only of tidy drawers. Of neatly folded linens. Of a world where stains knew their place, and their place was not on his crockery.

He raised his wand. He performed the precise, decisive flick.

""Purgo!""

There was a sound like a thousand tiny, efficient vacuums all whirring at once. A shimmering wave of pure, concentrated tidiness rolled over the mug. The stain vanished so completely it was as if it had never existed; not just the physical stain, but the very memory of the stain. The mug was now not just clean, but morally pure. It looked like it had never even considered holding a liquid as rebellious as coffee.

It was a resounding, unqualified success.

A feeling of profound triumph washed over Archie. He had done it! Clean, effective, predictable magic! He looked around the kitchen, his eyes alight with a new, terrifying power. He pointed his wand at a stack of unwashed plates.

""Purgo!""

The plates gleamed. The grease vanished. They were so clean, they seemed to repel the very air around them.

""Purgo!"" he whispered, aiming at the countertop. The crumbs, the sticky rings, the faint ghost of a lemon curd incident from three weeks prior‚Äîall gone. The surface was so pristine it looked like a diagram from a kitchen showroom.

""Archie, lad,"" Barry said, a note of concern in his voice. ""I think that's enough‚Äî""

But it was too late. Archie was drunk on cleanliness. He pointed his wand at the floor. ""Purgo!""

The dust, the dirt, a small, confused spider who was just passing through‚Äîall vanished. The floorboards weren't just clean; they were sanitized of history. They looked brand new, and slightly offended by the concept of feet.

The spell, fueled by Archie's pent-up desperation for order, had gained a momentum of its own. It was no longer a charm; it was a crusade. A wave of shimmering, antiseptic energy began to pulse outwards from Archie's wand, scouring everything in its path. It washed over the table, erasing a small, charming scratch. It washed over the fridge, removing a child's drawing from twenty years ago that had been held by a magnet. It was cleaning not just dirt, but patina. Not just mess, but character.

The kitchen was becoming a sterile, blank canvas. A perfectly hygienic void.

""MY BRIEFS!"" shrieked Mustard-1, as the wave approached his windowsill, threatening to erase the meticulously inked legal documents that were his reason for being.

Just as the purifying wave was about to lick at Barry's pot, Archie, in a moment of sheer panic, did the only thing he could think of. He threw his wand into the sink.

There was a fizzle, a pop, and the wave of aggressive cleanliness subsided.

The kitchen was spotless. Impeccable. It was also soulless. It looked like the kitchen of a person who had no past, and no expectation of a future involving any form of enjoyable mess.

The clay communication pot pinged. A single slip of parchment emerged.

CONGRATULATIONS! You have successfully mastered Module 3: The Scouring Charm.
Side-Effect: Hyper-Efficient Sanitization & Minor Reality Bleaching.
Please be advised:

¬∑ 1. The spell has been logged as performing at 147% of expected efficiency. This is noted as ""excessive enthusiasm.""
¬∑ 2. You have been automatically enrolled in Module 4: ""The Gentle Art of Re-Staining & Re-Introducing Ambiance.""
¬∑ 3. A small surcharge has been added to your account to cover the cost of spiritually replenishing your kitchen. The recommended method involves spilling a small amount of tea and leaving it for at least an hour.

Archie looked around his perfectly clean, perfectly sterile, perfectly depressing kitchen. Barry the Petunia was trembling, his vibrant colour looking garish and out of place in the new, bleached environment. Mustard-1 was frantically checking his documents for any erased clauses.

He had done it. He had performed magic perfectly. And in doing so, he had accidentally sterilized his own life of its charming, chaotic imperfections.

""Right,"" Archie said, his voice echoing slightly in the newly sanitized air. He walked to the kettle, which now looked like a clinical instrument, and boiled water. He made a cup of tea. And then, with a deliberate, almost ceremonial motion, he spilled a single, brown drop onto the immaculate countertop.

1o5cazm,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1o5cazm/are_video_games_bread_and_circuses_too/,"Are video games bread and circuses, too?","What is bread and circuses? It refers to a practice from Ancient Rome of keeping the public content and distracted from political and social issues by providing them free food and extravagant entertainment. Roman emperors lived under constant fear of rebellion, so they devised this strategy to ensure that the populace was perpetually pacified and docile, through food and entertainment, so they wouldn't revolt.

Welfare and Social programs are probably the closest to the bread aspect of this equation as they most closely mirror the free food of Ancient Rome. They provide the masses with something to lose if they were to bite the hand that feeds. Professional sports are probably the best example of the circuses aspect of this equation as they most closely mirror the colosseum of Ancient Rome. In addition to entertainment they also provide food and alcohol.

But what about video games? I feel like if the NFL qualifies, Call of Duty and Fortnite might as well. In the past year, I gave up drinking and watching professional sports. Just dropping those two things freed up a considerable amount of time and energy for me, that I was previously allocating to wasted time. However, the more I realize how we are being tricked into being our own babysitters, to keep ourselves distracted from the schemes of the elites, the more I realize just how complex this machine of control that they have constructed for us is. I stopped playing video games for a little while too and was stunned at how much more productive I am.

I was tempted to lump video games into ""mass entertainment"" with movies and television, but honestly I'm starting to wonder if they're worse. Because while they are equally being used for distraction (and arguably worse for social programming and propaganda) a movie or a television show has a natural conclusion...the story ends. The same cannot be said for most video games. Many video games can (and indeed are meant to) go on forever, to just keep your ass glued to the seat in front of the screen and keep leveling up a fake character in a fake world, while the elites keep scheming against us.

I added up all of my playtime across multiple accounts and systems and in the last fifteen years, I have wasted thousands of hours and hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars in a fake reality. Time and money that I could have more appropriately used to better myself and those around me.

Maybe it's just me and I'm overthinking this. Maybe I've had too much coffee and I need to go to sleep. But what do y'all think?",10,1760337128.0,conspiracy,5,0.86,False

1o5c8d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostlove/comments/1o5c8d9/an_unexpected_unwanted_answer/,"An Unexpected, Unwanted Answer...","Today, I began searching for someone who, on a whim, decided to get in touch again. 

However, 3 hours later, I got an answer that had stunned me to my very core...

Let me begin...

In 2022, I found this lady on a dating site. I was still recovering from my heart failure and quad coronary arterial bypass. We talked for a while and became Facebook Friends. We kept chatting. She'd tell me about her daughter and her life at a place approximately 1 hour and 25 minutes away, and I'd say to her about my life and how things were going.

One day, we decided to meet up, and we did at a local coffee shop. Sparks flew. I left after she left and thought things were pretty good. We met up again and we went around town... I took her to my place to do outdoor things and had fun.

Then, after that, she became less talkative and said she was ill. In August of 2022, she said nothing for a month. I said morning greetings to her regularly. Nothing. 

On my way home from work, I got my answer. A bad answer.

She was in a relationship. Not with me... Some other guy.

That night, I told her I was happy for her and wished her the best. She thanked me and said nothing. She was indifferent to me.

As I lay in bed, I said one last thing. To paraphrase, I said I was deeply hurt because I thought this was going somewhere. Instead, she was seeing ANOTHER MAN and didn't dare to tell me! I was GLAD to find out this way, as this told me what kind of person she was! Then, I blocked her on my Facebook and dating site and deleted the messages.

In 2024, maybe, I removed her from my block list. 

# 10/12/2025...

Today, on a sudden whim, I had an urge to look her up. After a few hours, I found her Facebook Page again. I sent her a simple message:

>Hi How are you doing?

So, I waited.

A couple of hours later, I thought she might have blocked me or seen it, or something. Nope. However, something told me to continue looking at this... It felt... off.

So, I looked up court cases with her name and saw something that struck a chord. A long name, but in her area, AND an address that sorta matched. 

It was for an estate without a will. She was the deceased.

I copied and pasted the family representative into Facebook search. It was her friend....

# I'll NEVER hear back from her. EVER AGAIN.

**She was killed in a car accident in July 2023.**

Now here I sit... in shock and sadness. Unsure *what* to feel. 

I feel stupid for looking. I feel dumb for all of it. 

I wish this were a copypasta. I wish I were posting an AI story. I wish it were all garbage...

It's not... I just went through it a few hours ago.

MODS: I have no idea if I'm posting in the right area or Sub-Reddit. Forgive me if I am wrong. I could show dox, but I don't want to drag a destroyed family into the Internet Spotlight. I can show the mods the legitimacy and guide me from there. ",1,1760336861.0,lostlove,0,1.0,False

Two¬†months¬†ago,¬†Shelby¬†breezed¬†back¬†into¬†town¬†and¬†took¬†over¬†Brandon¬†Grimes‚Äôs¬†world¬†like¬†she¬†owned¬†it.¬†

From¬†mixing¬†up¬†hangover¬†cures¬†to¬†laying¬†out¬†his¬†clothes,¬†from¬†dishing¬†up¬†his¬†meals¬†and¬†peeling¬†his¬†shrimp¬†to¬†linking¬†arms¬†for¬†evening¬†strolls,¬†she¬†even¬†had¬†his¬†bathwater¬†ready¬†before¬†bed.¬†

Matilda was¬†drowning¬†in work,¬†leading¬†the¬†charge¬†on a¬†cutting‚Äìedge¬†third‚Äìgen¬†imaging¬†chip,¬†barely¬†home¬†for¬†weeks.¬†
